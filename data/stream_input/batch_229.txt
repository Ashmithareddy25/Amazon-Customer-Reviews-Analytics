0345360338|5.0|With the exception of a few authors, I've found most Historical fiction to be too factual and not dramatic enough.  In cases where the drama was heavy, the facts are off (i.e. look at BRAVEHEART; great film but missing some Historical points, like the fact that the princess was about 7 or 8 at the time).  Anyway, I know my standards are high but that's the way it is and that's why I'm very glad I've found Penman.<br />This tale centers around the power struggle between Earl Simon de Montfort, a true Historical figure, and King Henry III.  As the latter continues to show his incompetence, Simon realizes he must fight against the tyranny of the British king.  To make this even harder is the fact that the earl's sons have grown up with the sons of Henry III, which includes soon to be Edward I (Longshanks) . . . and, Simon is married to Henry's sister.<br />But, what makes this story above and beyond most Historical fiction is it's heart.  The characters truly come alive and burn through the page setting the readers' soul on fire as we fall deeper and deeper into the story.  In other words, it breathes passion and most of us read to get those experiences which we fail to get in real life.  Enough said.<br />REVISION NOTE: I have just finished a second reading of this stellar novel and need to add a few points:<br />(1)Penman writes excellent subplot love stories;<br />(2) The relationship between Simon and his wife is well charged, lively and passionate; and<br />(3) There is a whole set of chapters about Wales, which deals with Lwellyn ap Gruffyd's conflicting loyalties to his father and grandfather.  A lot of this is setup for the next story in THE RECKONING (edited as of 09/05/03)
B00005YU1O|3.0|... possibly too much to absorb.<br />I'm so glad that Richard Linklater made THIS movie.  I think it's akin to something Kubrick might have tried if he were a young film-maker today (not that it's all that Kubrickian, but it's such a bold undertaking in terms of ideas and technology , it's similar to the experimental advances forged with &quot;2001&quot;).  I also think this will prove a benchmark movie, 20 years from now, when we can re-examine the point in cinematic history when digital methods became more widespread -- &quot;Waking Life&quot; is a bit like a metaphysical &quot;Steamboat Willie&quot; in that sense.<br />And the ideas the film addresses are truly interesting.  A lot of critics have rapped on it for sounding like a lot of stoned, 'college student navel gazing,' but they're just jaded.  College is generally the last time most of us have a chance to talk and think in philosophical terms.  In a world where most of us are locked into thinking about our jobs or our daily concerns 24/7, what's wrong with listening to characters talking about slightly more esoteric ideas and concepts?  In that respect, &quot;Waking Life&quot; ALMOST makes up for Linklater's other movie this year, the heavy-handed and aggressively knuckleheaded &quot;Tape.&quot;  <br />Plus, this is a beautiful movie.  The animation is basic but sly and expressive, the colors are rich, and it's neat to see cinematography subjected to animation -- the film is worth watching just to see the way the artists play with light they're animating over.<br />But having said all that, the film may be too much.  You're trying to watch and keep track of the images (which are busy and constantly changing), you're trying to absorb and process complicated dialogue on top of complicated dialogue, and you're also trying to just keep it all straight.  Basically, this is a movie that REQUIRES repeat viewings and yet... something about its basic density also discourages repeat viewings.  I watched &quot;WakingLife&quot; two days ago and enjoyed it... but I can't say I'm in a big hurry to rewind it and start all over again.<br />Perhaps this will be a movie that grows on me more over time, perhaps it'll be a film that I watch once a year and get something new from gradually.  &quot;Slacker&quot; certainly is, but &quot;Slacker&quot; also has a flesh-and-blood immediacy and a sense of fun to it that &quot;Waking Life,&quot; due to its own innovation, simply doesn't exude.  Nevertheless, love it or hate it, this is a movie that will be discussed and referenced well into the future.<br />(Just a note: this year, the Academy finally created an award for animated features; &quot;Waking Life&quot; was not nominated in that category; &quot;Jimmy Neutron: Boy Genius&quot; was.  I have 36 blisteringly smart remarks about that fact but I can't chose a favorite so I won't write down any of them)
0066620996|3.0|In his previous book, \\"Built to Last,\\" business writer Jim Collins looked at those companies, like Hewlett-Packard and Merck, that started off on the right foot with the right business DNA, in other words those companies that were born great. In \\"Good to Great\\" he now turns his attention to the more practical question of companies that achieve greatness.<br />With the help of a large research team, Collins used a rigorous selection process that identified 11 companies showing a transition from a 15 year period of stock returns no better than 1.25 times the general market to a 15 year period of stock returns more than 3 times the general market. These companies, which included the likes of Gillette and Philip Morris, were then subjected to detailed analysis and compared with similar companies that failed to make the leap to greatness, and even with some companies that made the initial leap only to fall back. \\"Good to Great\\" represents the condensed findings of this massive research project, with a range of findings from the logical to the startling that make this book essential reading for anybody in business.<br />Avoiding fancy jargon, Collins writes in a clear, concise style that uses effective analogies to get his points across. For example, Aesop's fable of the fox and the hedgehog is turned to good effect to contrast those companies that look sleek and skillful but ultimately fail, with those that look more unassuming but know one big thing that ensures their success.<br />Perhaps the most shocking finding regards styles of leadership, with the great-to-good companies being led by quiet, modest, self-effacing CEOs who combine professional will with personal humility and typically come from within the company -- a marked contrast with the messianic, high-profile CEO who claims to know all the answers.<br />This is a great book of its kind, but it misses the main point. Underneath all the positive and disciplined thinking favoured by Collins, is the simple metaphysical fact that too much business is killing our planet. Greater efficieny in business merely speeds up our manipulation by materialism, unleashing the uncontrollable economic cycles of growth that will finally chew up our hapless globe till it is reduced to an overpopulated and overexpolited travesty of greed, materialism, and subjection of the human spirit in the name of business efficiency.taphysical fact that too much business is killing our planet.

B00005JKCF|5.0|It may be a story lifted from the pages of a comic book, but with some strong performances, a focused story and some great F/X, director Sam Raimi puts blood in the veins of one of the best superheroes ever to hit the big screen.  And let's face it, right now the world needs just such a character; someone who can right wrongs, stave off injustice, assuage fears and give people a sense of security in a world seemingly gone amuck at times, and thanks to the magic of the movies we have him now.  His name is \\"Spider-Man.\\"<br /> Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) is a normal, if not typical teenager; mature beyond his years, he would rather attend a science fair than go to a rave, he lives with his aunt and uncle (Rosemary Harris, Cliff Robertson) and has been in love with Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst), the girl who lives next door, since about the first grade.  \\"MJ,\\" however, doesn't even know he exists; except for an occasional \\"hello,\\" they barely know one another.  But though Peter doesn't know it, all of that-- Peter's life-- is about to undergo a radical change.<br /> On a field trip to a science lab, Peter is bitten by a spider-- not just any spider, but one that's been genetically altered.  And when he wakes up the next morning, he finds himself changed; it's not exactly Kafka's Metamorphosis, but he does have new life and new energy, and beginning with his vision (he suddenly can see clearly without his glasses), he gradually discovers that he has certain physical abilities that do not necessarily coincide with the kind of changes consistent with a young man of his age.  Like being able to spin webs from his wrists and climb up the side of buildings.  And now all he has to do is learn how to control and use his newly found prowess, and decide what to do with it all.  Which he does very quickly, when circumstances provide him with a motive and a personal agenda that leads him to become, as Peter himself puts it, \\"Your friendly neighborhood Spider-Man.\\"<br /> With this film, Raimi takes a page out of the Tim Burton Book and gives us a character that is convincing and real, because he shows us the man first, and then the superhero.  Like Burton did in the original \\"Batman,\\" in which Michael Keaton played to the man, rather than to the \\"bat,\\" Raimi takes Maguire down the same path, having him play to Peter, rather than the \\"spider.\\"  And it makes all the difference in the world.  Instead of merely thrusting a full-blown superhero onto the screen, Raimi first develops a plausible storyline (screenplay by David Koepp) complete with a central character to whom the audience can relate, and once that is established it enables the audience to suspend disbelief and go with the flow when Peter emerges as Spider-Man.  The F/X are incredible, and Raimi uses the stunning visual aspect of the film to great effect, but it would all be for naught without the solid core of believable characters he puts into place and then uses as a foundation upon which to build the spectacular.  It's reality based, but imaginatively presented-- Raimi definitely knows what works and how to entertain and involve his audience, which he certainly does here.  And this is arguably Raimi's best work yet.<br /> When it was announced that Tobey Maguire had landed the role of Spider-Man, you could almost hear the collective audible gasp of fans everywhere.  Tobey Maguire?  Spider-Man?  !!!  But-- as it turns out-- it was inspired casting, as Maguire is perfect as everybody's favorite web-slinger.  In fact, hopefully he's been signed to a multi-picture deal, because now it is impossible to imagine anyone else in the role.  Without question, Maguire IS Spider-Man.  His appearance, the way he carries himself-- his entire countenance-- combined with his attitude and the subtle way he expresses himself, are all part and parcel of what brings Peter Parker and Spider-Man to life.  Maguire, as he has demonstrated previously in such films as \\"The Ice Storm\\" and \\"The Cider HouseRules,\\" has a naturally pleasing and accessible personality that serves him so well in the characters he creates, and none more so than with his portrayal of Peter.  He has the talent and ability to aptly convey that \\"ordinary person under extraordinary circumstances\\" scenario and make it believable, which is exactly what was needed to make this film successful; and Maguire nails it with a performance that is introspective and affecting, and it makes the character-- as well as the film-- work.  <br /> Willem Dafoe also contributes to the film's appeal with his portrayal of Norman Osborn, aka, the \\"Green Goblin.\\"  Not since the Joker sparred with Batman has the screen had such a memorable villain; and again, Dafoe first plays to the man-- to Osborn-- and then to the \\"Goblin,\\" which puts a real face on Evil and gives the character the depth that makes him more than just superficially \\"bad.\\"  Defoe goes that extra mile to make a Osborn real, and deserves credit for giving him real substance, rather than being satisfied with a one dimensional character that has nothing going on beneath the surface.  The Goblin is a complex character, and Dafoe plays him perfectly.<br /> Kirsten Dunst had something of a challenge with her role of Mary Jane, as the character is somewhat ambiguous; on one hand, she plays a pivotal role in motivating Spider-Man, while her own part in the grand scheme of things remains uncertain until the end.  And only then are we given a glimpse of the direction in which MJ may go, and it will be interesting to see how the character develops in the next installment, now that the groundwork has been ably laid by Dunst.  In the final analysis, \\"Spider-Man\\" is a winner that is going to attract a huge following; this is one film that definitely has legs.
6304806426|5.0|This movie makes me cry everytime I see it.  Ralph Fiennes is incredible in his role.  The movie really brings up a moral dilemma and is left somewhat unresolved in the most pitiful way you could imagine and you just flat out bawl crying.  I loved it so much!!  I do think you will either love or hate this movie.  I think the book is not so good.  This is one case in which a movie is better than a book.
0792833686|5.0|Perhaps Singin' in the Rain is as flawless as it is possible for a movie to be. It is difficult to find fault with what has been called the greatest movie musical of all time. Being written straight for the screen, it is not hampered by the stagey feel that marrs so many film musicals. On the contrary, it is brilliantly cinematic.<br />The cinematography is fluid, enchanting, and memorable; the choreography, impressive and captivating; the musical numbers, exciting; the cast, rarely bettered; and the screenplay, witty and charming. The story takes an introspective and satirical look at Hollywood during the late '20s, the genesis of the sound era. It provides us with an often hilarious snapshot of the studios during a time of change. Singin' in the Rain never runs out of steam; it might be a manual on how to make a film. Pure entertainment.
B00005JKJA|5.0|This film is absolutely brilliant.  Days later, I was still thinking about the movie.  My favorite part was the Spanish version of Crying in the club Silencio.  It reminded of Laura Palmer crying in TP:FWWM in the club.  There are still things about the movie I totally do not understand--who was the monster--Diane? or the devil?, were they ever even in the apartment, if so why does the aunt come back to see what the noise was?  The score is absolutely breathtaking.  Laura Herring is beautiful and Naomi Watts performance exceptional.<BR>Let's face it, Lynch is a guy you either love or hate, get or don't get, etc.  He makes movies that make you think; ie this is not for someone who just can't get enough of those Rush Hour movies.  He is the absolute art film director and in tune to the surrealist movement.
B000050XEI|5.0|Enya has always been kind of like a role model for me.  She is beautiful and very talented and this CD shows that talent.  As soon as I bought it, I fell in love with it and I play it everyday.  Every song sends a sort of dreamy feeling as if you could just close your eyes and picture yourself in another world.  The song \\"Tempus Vernum\\" kind of sounds like a medieval evil theme to it but I like that.  \\"Wild Child\\" and \\"One by One\\" are one of my favorites.  They all sound so beautiful.  If you do not get this CD, you are missing out on an enchanting voice.
0393312836|3.0|A Clockwork Orange is a book of definite motif and an understanding of a life people usually refuse to recognize.  Not only was the main character/narrator's, Alex, lifestyle portrayed specifically throughout the novel, it was greatly astounding to be noticed as a life worth meaning and acknowledgement.  Alex's life was one of violence, a typical hooligan's life who grows up with gangs and other such bad influences.  There is a dramatic change in the course of the novel from it's beginning which keeps the excitement up, because I have to admit, the beginning is redundant with the amount of violence displayed.  The twist in the plot is ironic and surprising.  There is meaning behind all the slang Borgess speaks with through Alex.  If you are a person who is able to find meaning if small areas of life and depict reality from the real world, I suggest this book.  It gives one a purpose, a meaning to look for between the lines of this book.  It keeps one entertained by creating a desire to know what happens to Alex.  The end gives one a sweet sense of satisfation although the ending is nothing you could ever imagine.  Enjoy.
B00005QZWI|5.0|Howard Shore and Enya, you've done it again.  This is a perfect CD to own if you like the sound of soft instruments playing in your ear or the loud trumpets sending your body crumbling.  The way this CD is set up is very clever.  Each song goes in the exact order as it is on the movie.  That way, as you listen, you can picture the movie scene in your head.  What makes the CD even better is that the blessed appearance of Enya who sings so beautifully.  This CD should be added to your collection.
B0000636UN|2.0|I've always been a fan of Sheryl Crow's, so when I heard her new single, I just had to buy the CD.  I was feeling rather happy with my choice when listening to the upbeat &quot;Steve McQueen&quot; and &quot;Soak up the Sun&quot; as the first two tracks...  but after that I was left wondering what would make Sheryl record such a lethargic and depressing CD.  I'm sorry, but not impressed.
B000000WA4|5.0|This double CD by The Smashing Pumpkins is the greatest album I ever bought. 28 songs of pure beauty and poetry. The lyrics by Billy Corgan are amazing!!

B00005JKCF|5.0|.<br />Review:<br />One of the best comic book hero movies to come out, melding comic book-fantasy into drama through script writing and impressive special effects.  <br />Peter Parker, AKA Spiderman (Tobey Maguire) and Mary Jane (Kirsten Dunst) make a good romantic team while Green Goblin (Defoe) delivers a solid bad guy character (ok, the costume was a bit weak).  <br />Story:        <br />Peter Parker gains super human (spider-like) strength and vision after being bitten by a genetically enhanced super spider.  This enables Peter to easily climb buildings (or, anything), lift heavy objects, and sense impending danger, etc.  <br />Spiderman's story portrays his struggle with his own youth, and his life's challenges of betrayal and murder with hie new found gifts.<br />Audience:<br />Great movie for comic hero buffs, adventure movie watchers, and not-so-young kids.  The story balances drama and humor delivering an emotional roller coaster. <br />Scare Factor:<br />While it is a comic book story representation, the story and depictions isn't necessarily for the youngest children.
B00005JKCF|5.0|Did the movie live up to the hype? It went beyond the hype. The effects, the acting, the directing and the music were marvelously interwoven....cheers for Danny Elfman. This was a marvelous film, one that the creators of Spidey can be proud of.  Personally I loved the NBC TV show and can't remember the guy who played Spidey, but I have always been \\"in love\\" with the Spiderman character.  IF you're going to compare this with other renditions, don't go.  It's a perfectly wholesome film to get hooked into and I don't care if it was a little smarmy in spots.  There were a couple of scenes that were outa the 60's but that didn't keep me from enjoying a refreshing outlook on this Superhero.  It's a delightful film from the word go and I look forward to more.  Great job all!
B00005JKCF|4.0|\\"This is a story about a girl,\\" says Peter Parker, in the voice-over narration that opens the film.  He's almost right.  It *is* about a girl, but it's also about something more: comic books.  An unabashed, from your head down to your toes, childlike love of comic books.  It seeps into every frame of \\"Spider-Man\\", into the script, and into the actor's performances.<br />Now, not being a comic fanatic myself, movies that take this track usually don't grab me (\\"X-Men\\" and \\"Unbreakable\\" being two prime examples; both were terrible disappointments).  But \\"Spider-Man\\", which lurches along the precipice of clumsiness at times, did its best not to disappoint me.  And for the most part, it succeeds.<br />To begin with, choosing Sam Raimi to helm this production is a plus (ahem, it's *always* a plus).  The pure visual inventiveness he brought to the \\"Evil Dead\\" movies and \\"The Quick and the Dead\\" (my favourite), combined with the latter movie's moral ambiguity and propulsive plot, would be a perfect fit for this film.  And it was.  Raimi, an unabashed Spidey fan from way back, injects the film with a sense of visual fun, uniqueness, and intelligence.  He really shines during the film's first third, when Peter gets bitten and then discovers his powers, all the while trying to stay out of the way of the school bullies.  These scenes have a grand sense of marvel (pun intended) to them, while keeping things very intimate.  Watch how slyly information is presented in the background -- through Peter, a tour guide, and abundant video monitors -- while the class is on their field trip.  No sooner is Peter's fate foreshadowed than the 'super-spider' bites him.<br />The swinging through the streets scenes, which were always static and bland in the Spider-man cartoon series, rollercoast with energy and verve.  A moment in the school hallway, where Peter Parker first notices his knack for precognition, slows time to a stand still, whips around a spit ball, and then speeds up just in time to watch a fist power its way through a locker.  These are stunning visual and visceral moments.  The action sequences are epic and inventive, especially when the Goblin and Spidey duel above Times Square.  And when it's just Spidey vs. street thugs, things have a definite (and addictive) Jackie Chan/\\"Crouching Tiger\\" feel about them.<br />But my favourite moment, the one that best summarizes Raimi's influence over the film, is when Spidey has to make a \\"Sophie's Choice\\"-like decision, the intensity of which levels the audience with drama not seen in your standard summer popcorn fare.<br />The cast, although saddled with a sometimes vigorous but often clunky dialogue, is uniformly good.<br />Tobey Maguire does fine showing Peter Parker's geeky side, his torment, and his lust.  And when he becomes Spider-Man, he shows true awe and wonder at what he can do.  And then true pain when he realizes that his gift is also his curse.  Maguire, who has shown that he is more than adept at portraying teen angst with a beatific look on his face, does a lot of that here.  And it works.  Physically, he also works.  Spider-Man is not supposed to be muscle-bound; he is lithe and athletic, like a gymnast.  Maguire looks and acts the part perfectly.<br />Willem Dafoe, who plays the Norman Osborn, chews scenery well enough, but his character's motivations were clumsily handled.  Having mirrors depict a split personality, while appropriate, is a bit cliche and ham-handed.  I admire the filmmakers for at least trying to introduce some complex psychology into an action shoot-'em-up.  But they didn't commit enough to it to make it effective.  However, Dafoe's Green Goblin get-up, complete with armored mask and a deadly floating surfboard contraption, was terrifying.<br />Kirsten Dunst is desirable enough as Mary-Jane \\"M.J.\\" Watson.  But here too the character's psychology is underdone.  Just because she has a messed-up homelife, is this intelligent and energetic girl really going to fallfar one bullying pretty-boy after another?  I suspect that this part of her character truly displays the fact that these are real teenagers here, making real, irrational teenager decisions.  But why couldn't they make the girl more perfect (like any good comic book girlfriend would be)?  She's plenty pretty, but terribly shallow.  Dunst does well enough looking wistfully at the sky when Spidey takes off, but she's capable of handling a lot more than the filmmaker's gave her while he was on the ground with her.<br />In the film's best, non-star, part, J.K. Simmons, as J. Jonah Jamison, best exemplifies the comic book feel that this movie embraces.  He spits out his lines like they were watermelon seeds, landing bon mot after bon mot with deadly accuracy, and generally taking over the movie with the enormity of his personality every time he's on-screen.  It's a big and healthy role, and Simmons, with too little screen time, makes it come alive.  Here's to more of J.J.J. when it's time for the sequel.<br />\\"Spider-Man\\", compared to other summer blockbusters, is an ambitious and distinctive film.  It often aims high, and sometimes even manages to hit its target.  Which is enough for me, at this time of the year.  I'll call it a fine thrilling ride, not expect anything more than that, and we'll all leave the theatre satisfied.
B00005JKMQ|3.0|Muhammad Ali was so much bigger than life that any biopic is likely to have come up short.  But to those of us who grew up watching Ali in his prime, this film is a real disappointment.<br />Director Michael Mann is a highly talented director with films like \\"Heat\\", \\"The Insider\\" and \\"Last of the Mohicans\\" to his credit.  Yet, in this film he takes the wrong tack and clutters it with boring details and excessive focus on racial issues that were ancillary to the life of a very exciting boxer and a dynamic showman.<br />To do justice to Ali's entire life, you would have to make three films.  One for the boxing, one to look behind the scenes of a complicated man, and one to chronicle his interaction with the Nation of Islam and the civil rights implications of his refusal to be inducted into the army.  The most interesting of the three are the first two.  Yet, Mann decides to give us the first and third elements with the greatest emphasis on the civil rights angle, which is clearly the least interesting aspect of Ali despite the controversy.  It seems that Mann is on a crusade to impress us with what a central figure Ali was in the civil rights movement and that his boxing was secondary to that role.  Mann wants us to believe that Ali was a civil rights leader who just happened to be a boxer, when in reality he was first and foremost an outstanding boxer with a flamboyant and arrogant attitude and a rapier wit.<br />Mann completely neglects the element that he presents so superbly in \\"The Insider\\", the character development of the main character.  In \\"The Insider\\", Mann drills deep into Wigand's (Russell Crowe) psyche and turns Bergman (Al Pacino) inside out.  In \\"Ali\\", Mann glosses over Ali's motivations and concentrates more on Ali as part of a larger mosaic rather than the fascinating character he really was.  He only gives a hint of the close relationship between Ali and Cosell, which could have been a film by itself.<br />The boxing scenes were well choreographed,but overly long with too much emphasis on too few fights.  Ali was one of the most active heavyweight champion ever, sometimes fighting four or five times per year, but from this film it seems like he had only four fights in his career.  We didn't need to see 15 minutes of George Foreman pounding Ali against the ropes to get the idea.<br />Will Smith does an excellent job of portraying Ali.  Though he sometimes misses on Ali's rapid fire poetic cadence, he hits the mark a high percentage of the time and delivers a very realistic portrayal.  In the ring, he does a passable job of imitating some of Ali's more notable moves like the \\"Ali Shuffle\\" and his penchant for dodging punches with his hands dangling by his side.  But no one can come close to imitating that lightning jab.<br />As much acclaim as Smith got for this role, John Voight steals the show as Howard Cosell.  Though the physical resemblance is not that great, Voight's command of Howard's movements and speech patterns is nothing short of phenomenal.<br />One thing that is very disappointing is that the DVD has absolutely no bonus material.  This is a topic that could have provided hours of background material and original footage and there wasn't even a featurette.<br />Overall, this film is entertaining for those who never saw Ali fight, or bad mouth an opponent in a new conference.  But for those of us who were lucky enough to see this brilliant athlete and flamboyant personality in his prime, this film never leaves the ground.  I rated it a 6/10.  For anyone interested in the real Muhammad Ali, see \\"Muhammad Ali - the Whole Story\\", a six hour documentary that will show you why no biopic can ever do him justice.
B00005V3Z4|4.0|Set aside your preconceived notions about this movie if you've formed an impression of it just from trailers and blurbs.  &quot;Donnie Darko&quot; is a delightful stew of science fiction and horror in the true sense of the word, with just the right amount of black comedy thrown in.  <br />It's difficult to exlain the vast difference in my expectations versus the reality of this movie experience without typing spoilers.  Let it suffice to say that the two of us were on the edge of our seats and one of us was heard to say &quot;I STILL have no idea how this is gonna turn out&quot; with only five minutes remaining.  Very trippy.  &quot;Twin Peaks&quot; meets &quot;Harvey&quot; meets &quot;Back to the Future&quot;.  Drew Barrymore (executive producer) as a disillusioned high school teacher and Patrick Swayze as a new age fear-versus-love guru turn in quality performances.  And Frank the Rabbit gave me nightmares - high praise indeed from this jaded horror fan.  Don't miss this one!
B00005JKBC|4.0|Despite a few inconsistencies and contrivances, Spy Games is one of the better espionage films to hit the streets in quite some time.  The story is intelligent, the action is brisk and the suspense taut.<br />Tony Scott orchestrates the project well, perhaps overdoing the musical element a bit, but pacing well and creating an effective weave between flashbacks and current day events.  Yet, there are a couple of areas that bothered me.  First, Muir (Robert Redford) was consistently developed throughout the film to be a hardened leader, always looking at the big picture and following the imperative regardless of the human cost.  So, his rogue operation to save Bishop is completely out of character.  Not only is it difficult to believe that the CIA would have been fooled by some of his deceptions, it is hard to swallow the fact that he would have risked everything to pursue a rescue that was antithetical to his training, beliefs and personality.  <br />It is also difficult to understand how Bishop was allowed to stay in the field, given his penchant for disobeying orders and his continual development of emotional attachments to his various human assets.  Such recklessness would never have been tolerated, because it would have endangered him, the assets, and would have potentially compromised whatever mission he was working on.  However, I suppose I need to cut the writers a little slack or otherwise there would have been no story.<br />Robert Redford turns in an excellent performance, giving Muir a very hard edge and cunning mind.  Brad Pitt proves to be an effective action hero.  This is the kind of role in which Pitt shines, playing the dark, rebellious character that lives by his own code and gives in to no one.  Catherine McCormack also delivers a credible performance as the humanitarian aid worker playing both sides of the street to get supplies for the disadvantaged. <br />Action lovers will enjoy this film as will those who like a mentally challenging story.  Irated it 8/10.
6305428220|3.0|I like most of Robert Rodriguez' work... I just now got around to seeing this one. Not bad, but nothing special. Decent acting, (especially Robert Patrick as your typical [mean] football coach) but some pretty cheesy, TV grade special effects, especially when compared to the films it [copies]. This movie was obviously targeted at teenagers, with each of your stereotypical highschoolers represented. Some of the high school humor and angst was actually entertaining. <br />**SPOILERS**<br />After seeing this, I had to ask myself: is this an homage to or just a [copy] of Carpenter's \\"The Thing\\" and \\"Invasion Of The Body Snatchers\\"? The whole \\"who's really a human\\" and subsequent testing scene are a complete [copy] of \\"The Thing\\", without any of the dread and tension of that masterpiece. Not to mention the crawling head scene, which is a perfect example of why cheap CGI effects are still not as effective as good old fashioned animatronics.<br />I have to give them credit for having the audacity to use crank(homemade speed) as the method of saving mankind, I was laughing and shaking my head in disbelief! <br />******<br />If you are a teenager I'm sure you'll love this movie. But if you want to see a REALLY scary movie, rent John Carpenter's \\"The Thing\\".
B000063DFQ|5.0|This is the greatest, melodious, masterful piece of musical genius that Iron Maiden has produced. I have been listening to this CD for 18 years, and I can honestly tell you that it these songs never get old. If you are just starting to get into Maiden, pick up this album. Everything comes together on it, muscially, lyrically, everything. This is the album that will get you hooked. I first heard it in 1984, and after that I was hooked and first in line when 'Powerslave' hit the shelves, been a Maiden fan ever since.
0393312836|4.0|Anthony Burgess' modern classic A CLOCKWORK ORANGE revolves around a central ethical conundrum: is it better to let a violent criminal continue to be disposed to crime than to remove that which essentially makes him human, his free will?<br />The narrator, a teenager named Alex, is a hoodlum in a near-future where gangs roam the streets and society is decaying. After a string of crimes, Alex is betrayed by his companions and winds up sentenced to over a decade in prison. After two years behind bars, he is given the opportunity to be the subject of a new experimental theraphy, \\"Ludovico's treatment\\", which would have him cured and a free man in a mere two weeks. Alex loses his criminal tendencies, but Burgess asks, \\"At what cost\\"? After this setup, A CLOCKWORK ORANGE goes on to examine what stripping a person of his free will would mean for him and society.<br />A CLOCKWORK ORANGE is also the reaction of a Briton against communist governments, this book was obviously written in the early 1960's. The administration which seeks to tame Alex seems benevolent, but there are signs of growing despotism. In foreboding one passage, a prison official expresses his hope that Alex will leave the prison, as the space will soon be needed for political prisoners. The dialect that Alex's generation speaks, Nadsat, is a mixture of Russian and English words, and shows a Soviet influence on this future England. This makes the book feel somewhat dated, my reason for giving it four stars.<br />A CLOCKWORK ORANGE is written in Alex's dialect, and nearly every sentence has Russian words written as they sound to English ears. However, this is rarely a problem, as Burgess gives sufficient context to quickly understand such common words as \\"glazzies,\\" \\"pletchoes\\", \\"tolchock\\", and \\"devotchka\\". The Russian words are nearly all extremely common anotomical terms, so for those who want to be certain about every word of Nadsat, any small Russian dictionary will do.<br />Stanley Kubrick's 1972 film of A CLOCKWORK ORANGE went on to become popular, buut be aware that the book is a very different story. Kubrick based his film off the original American edition of the book, which lacks the crucial final chapter in which Burgess reveals a suprising plot turn, which reverses much of what came before. Thus, the book and the movie have totally opposite messages. The book is also more graphic than the movie. While the movie has Alex in a tryst with two teenage girls, the original scene from the book has him molest two ten-year olds after shooting heroin. Thus, for those sensitive to explicit content, the book may be more objectionable than the movie, although the book's thick dialect and sparse detail does not have the force of actually seeing such things in a movie.<br />A CLOCKWORK ORANGE may appeal to those intrigued by the moral dilemma it presents. It is also suprisingly entertaining for new students of Russian, as this reviewer found. If you enjoy A CLOCKWORK ORANGE, I'd recommend going on to Burgess' work 1985, in which he examines George Orwell's work 1984 from a viewpoint closer to that year, this book is somewhat of a continuation of several themes of A CLOCKWORK ORANGE.of A CLOCKWORK ORANGE went on to become popular, buut be aware that the book is a very different story.

B00005YW4H|5.0|this a great album, the miles melt away when i have this CD in my car.
B00005R2M3|3.0|Sharika has proven she has the ability to write her own lyrics and produce her work, but this isn't one of my favourites. Her voice echoes other good artists, but she's hard to understand on some songs. It's a upbeat sound and fairly pleasant to listen to, but this is not a great piece of work. While Sharika has been recording songs for a long time, she should realise her work leaves a lot to be desired. Buy it if your a fan of hers but don't expect excellence in this one.
1573301183|5.0|I bought this video in 1999 and have watched it about 50 times (probably more).  I love it!  This was a great live band.  I had always hoped for their reunion, but now that will never happen.  What a shame.  If you loved AIC or just love good music and great live performances, get this video.
B00005U122|5.0|In The Flesh is a world tour Roger Waters will be finishing this June, and while he was visiting the states, he releases a double cd and a DVD.<br />Both are divided in an all Floyd half, and the other one is a half-floyd, half solo career and a new song.<br />Here are the pros and cons of In The Flesh DVD:<br />Pros:<br />- I actually found the DVD at a cheaper price than the cds.<br />- The Band (Snowy White, Doyle Braham II, Fairweather Low, The 3 singing chicks....) are awesome throughout.<br />- The sound on the DVD and on the tour is tremendous, and I was glad that acute attention was paid to every little sound effect from the albums. <br />- Once you 'get over' the fact that there's no dave (guitar and vocals), no Rick and no Nick, you can really appreciate what these talented group of musicians are doing.<br />- The concert starts off with a bang with 'In The Flesh'. A song which I always thought would be the best concert opener. Followed by a tight rendition of 'Happiest Days Of Our Lives' and 'Another Brick In The Wall Part 2'. This section along with 'Mother' almost made me cry. 'Happiest Days' is great and Waters adds even the slightest sound effects from the original songs (Hey you, stand still laddy). ABITW 2 is different, hearing the 3 women sing we don't need no education was a shock.<BR>But once you get into Waters gimmick of having them as back-up vocals so as his voice wont sound as weak, you find they actually add to a lot to the songs.<br />- Next is a mellow and heartfelt perfomance of 'Mother'. Roger actually plays the guitar in this one. Dave's lyrics (mother) are done by the three singing chicks, this actually feels at home since mother is a female character. Roger sings with a lot of emotion IMO on this track, beautiful end to 'The Wall' Section. In my opinion, adding 'Mother; was a very good choice. <br />- Next off are 2 songs from 'The Final Cut': 'Get Your Filthy Hands off my desert' and 'Southhampton Dock'. Both are played and delivered beautifully but very short. 'Southhampton Dock' is particularly beauitiful. But all in all, a short section.<br />- This is followed by 2 songs from 'Animals': 'Pigs on the wing Part 1' and 'Dogs'. 'Pigs on the wing 1' is short and sweet, followed by 'Dogs', now THAT was a gutsy move by Roger. 'Dogs' is cut down to size and some of the notes are changed, and Dave's lyrics are sung by the keybordist/guitarist (a very talented guy with a good voice), I can't remeber his name as of now, and he does a good job, but still, one can't help miss Dave's voice. Roger ends with his section of the lyrics. All in all, this was a tight and stupendous number, I was really glad he added this one on his tour. <br />- This is followed by three songs from 'Wish You Were Here': 'Welcome To The Machine' was another very, very gutsy move on Roger's part. He sings it nicely, and they play it beautifully, again I was VERY happy he added this one along with Dogs, two songs I would have loved to see on PULSE.<br />- Wish You Were Here is sung by Waters. I'm actually glad he chose to sing it himself, it's different but it still feels heartfelt. Next is 'Shine On You Crazy Diamond' which is all over the place, the sections are shifted but still, it IS a great song and feartures IMO Snowy White's best guitar work.<br />- To top the first section off we have 'Set the controls for the heart of the sun'. This old floyd classic gets a welcome R&B groove and a very bluesy sax solo (yes, sax solo) in the middle. I think this actually improves on the original, even though I still miss the original bass lines and taken as individuals, they both seem like 2 different songs. I still like the original though.<br />- The second section starts off with a bang: 3 songs from Dark Side. 'Breathe' is surprisingly waterless bocally, so is 'Money'. But it was very brave of him to sing the first part of 'Time', when I heard 'Ticking away, the moments...' delivered by Waters, it sent shivers up my spine. This section is actually pretty tight and well played, Breathe is ok, Time is very well played (or immitated if you wish), but Money gets into this very welcome jamming section that gets the audience more interested and Waters' bass is better than in the rest of the concert.<br />- This introduces us to 5 selections from Waters solo years. First off is 'Every Strangers Eyes' from 'Pros and Cons of Hitchhiking', it is sung very emotionally and the lyrics are so beautiful, it perfectly goes into 'Perfect Sense 1 & 2'.<br />- Next off are 4 selections from Waters amazing 'Amused to Death' solo album. First off is 'Perfect Sense 1&2' that song seemed perfect for a live gig, and man oh man does it work. It really gets the crowd going and it's a real energy-charged section because it is followed with 'The Bravery of being out of Range' a real heavy song that is played and sung with a lot of energy.<br />- This adrenaline infused section prepares the audience to withstand two mellow but beautiful songs. First off is 'It's a Miracle', if it didn't have such beautiful lyrics and Roger's emotion-driven voice, it would have ruined the tempo of the concert so far, but it doesn't. Next off is 'Amused to death' a gem from that album that is sung flawlessly by Waters and the female backup vocalists. Beautiful.<br />- This is closely followed by the orgasmic section of Dark Side: 'Brain Damage'/'Eclipse'. This really builds in energy and explodes. By this point you can see the band is really into it and so is the audience. <br />- This leads to 'Comfortably Numb'. David's part (Pink) is sung by Doyle Braham II. He does a good job but still... Waters' part (Doctor) is delivered perfectly and with amazing energy and precision. The solos of course don't compare and that's good because these guys don't seem to want to immitate Dave, but do their own stuff with the notes. Even though they needed two guitars to complete Dave's sound.<BR>* Doesn't compare to the CN on PULSE, but again we 'SHOULDN'T' compare.<br />- To top it all off is a new song called 'Each Small Candle'. The first verse is a poem written by a torture victim. Really heartfelt lyrics delivered beautifully by Waters. Really is a ray of hope in contrast to Water's other gloomy lyrics. I'm glad he introduces us to this song on this tour.<br />- By the end you get the sense that Waters isn't such a [jerk] after all. By watching the concert and him closely as well as the 20+ min. documentary you really get the idea that if Dave, Rick and Nick would get off their [rears] and propose something theyre might be a remote chace (2 or maybe 3/10 of a chance) that they might do something together.<br />- Great image quality and the 20+ min. doc. is a welcome special feature, so are the stills and the band biographies. Did I mention the sound is awesome.<br />Cons:<br />- Why those two short songs in representation of 'The Final Cut'. Why not two of those 3+ min. masterpieces like 'Fletcher Memorial', 'The Final Cut', 'One of the Few', 'The Gunners Dream' or 'Not Now John' (now that would have been something!).<br />- Why in the hell not play 'Pigs on the wing' extended 8-track version. I mean he had Snowy White, he was right there!!! <BR>The extended version is actually parts 1 & 2 united by a bridge solo played by snowy white, all in all a fuller song, that just aches to be played live. <br />- Why only 'Every Strangers Eyes' from 'Pros & Cons', that album had so many good songs on it. Would have preffered 'Pros & Cons of Hitchhinking', 'Go Fishing', 'Sexual Revolution' among others. <br />- No Radio KAOS??<br />- Roger doesn't sing as much as we want him to, we know that he's got a weak voice by now, but still...<br />- Guitar notes and bass lines are changed here and there, I don't really know if this is a con, but there's gonna be the usual guy that says \\"hey he missed some notes on 'Dogs'\\". Be open-minded, we don't want the same song, that's why we have the original album. Changes for live performances are 'almost always' welcome. <br />All in all...<br />Well worth owning. Is it as good as PULSE (the video, images withstanding)? Well no, not as, but pretty close.
B000021Y74|5.0|Run Lola Run is a wonderful movie. It keeps the viewer interested because there are three different endings to the movie. Just when you think it's over, new obstacles are presented in the plot and the suspense keeps you on the edge of your seat. Franka Potente is excellent in the role of Lola. Her determination to help her boyfriend, Manny, is inspiring. I consider this film one of my favorites and I suggest that everyone, males and females, see Run Lola Run.
B00005JKCF|4.0|I was never really into Spider-Man when I first heard about it, but on Friday, the first day it came out, I was really Pumped and Excited to see it! As I was watching it, I was in awe of all the things that this movie had! It had lots of action and comedy rolled into one, which was great to see.<br />Tobey Maguire, Kirsten Dunst, Willem Dafoe, James Franco & Rosemary Harris were great and portrayed their characters in an excellent way. Though, I didn't really read *that much* of the comics or watched the cartoon a lot but, from what I saw, they pulled it off quite well. <br />So far, X-Men and Spider-Man remains on my list for my favorite comic book to film Adaptations. Surely the Spider-Man DVD will be a *Must Have* for My Collection!<br />Overall Spider-Man was well done and will leave you wanting more.
B00005RG6M|5.0|How do you improve on the perfect cd?<BR>Remix it into 5.1 sound.<BR>I've been picking up DVD-A discs for a while now.  Some have improved on the original material (anything by Clapton or Fleetwood Mac), and others have been a waste of a disc (Foreigner's 4 is awful).  I've never heard a cd that could benefit from a multi channel mix as much as \\"A Night At The Opera\\", and it truly lived up to its potential.  It seems like most sound engineers really don't know what to do with the rear channels.  In the otherwise great \\"Rumours\\" by Fleetwood Mac, there are some tracks where you hear nothing but distracting cymbal crashes from behind.  Whoever engineered this one made terrific use of all the channels. He truly makes it feel like you're standing in the middle of the band during a performance of \\"Bohemian Rhapsody\\", and that, even if nothing else was good here, would make it well worth the purchase price.  In the original mix, Roy Thomas Baker stacked Brian May's guitars and layers and layers of harmony vocal tracks on top of each other to make for a thick wall of sound.  In the DVD-A mix, those same tracks are spread over all the discrete channels in your surround system to make it even more memorable.<BR>Hot spots--  \\"Bohemian Rhapsody\\" (obviously), \\"The Prophet's Song\\", \\"Death On Two Legs\\", and \\"Love Of My Life\\".<BR>Important note:  The surround mix will play only in DTS Mode---  Make sure your player or receiver can decode it.  As with all DVD-A discs, any Dolby Digital/ DTS capable player can play them, but a special DVD-A player is required to access the special features, such as the groundbreaking \\"Bohemian Rhapsody\\" video, included here and remixed into DTS 5.1.
B00005JKCF|5.0|This movie lived up to all my expectations and more. It stayed with it's comic book roots, and combined it with realism of the world in which we live. The casting was immaculate. Willam defoe was perfect as the green Goblin. If the next 2-infinity of Spider-man movies are done in the same way, then the sky is the limit. Everyone should see this movie. I waited to see it since I saw the made for TV version in 1975. I saw that when I was 5 and 20 years later, justice has been done to one of the greatest super heroes to grace comics.
B000002I53|5.0|This recording catches the trane during a unique and important period in his career when he was making the transition from his more standard bop recordings (e.g. &quot;Giant Steps&quot;, &quot;Blue Trane&quot;) to the more exploratory, free-form recordings, such as &quot;A Love Supreme&quot;, and &quot;Meditations&quot;. So in some sense the listener gets the best of both worlds with this recording: accessibility and depth rolled into one brilliant whole. And what a recording! Roughly a third is the legendary interpretation of Rogers and Hammerstein's &quot;My Favorite Things&quot;, which represents one of my top five musical recordings of all time. The word that comes to my mind when I think of this tune (and for that matter the entire cd) is &quot;organic&quot;, in the sense that Coltrane, Tyner, Jones, and Davis seem like one entity here. Hard to tell where one's instrument ends and the another's begins. It's as beautiful as life itself. &quot;Summertime&quot; rougly takes up another third of the cd, and, had I not first been exposed to the title track, could also have easily made my top 5 recordings of all time list. Finally, If you are relatively new to John Coltrane's music, I highly recommend this cd over any other for its accessibility, and how highly representative it is of the spiritual magic found in Coltrane's later music playing with Jones and Tyner.
B00003CX5P|3.0|Really, I did.  But episode 1 just lacks even the most basic chemistry that ANY of the original films had.  I'm not saying I didn't enjoy myself at the film, or that this is not one of the better DVD's out there.  Both are true.  Unfortunately, this DVD has extra features that command more attention than the film itself.  I thought this film was done very well in some respects and I did find the story line interesting as I tried to tie in events from the previous films.  But this film is doomed to be the first part of a six part series so by nature it is slower.<br />The DVD looks great and sounds great.  The extras are voluminous.  Lucasfilm did a great job in that regard.  In the future, Lucas and Co. should worry more about having believable actors & actresses than CG backgrounds.<br />Can't really recommend this or trash it.  It's just average.
B00005U8EM|3.0|To all potential buyers. This DVD does NOT include the DTS track.
B00005QG9J|5.0|Listening to this CD was the first time I ever heard Incubus. I got it as a xmas gift by mistake. Instead of returning it, I opened it up anyway and I'm sure glad I did.... The songs blew me away. It was a refreshing and welcome change on my part since I'm constantly looking for new music to add to my personal library. Ever since, I've gotten a hold of every Incubus CD I could get my hands on. I haven't been dissapointed yet, but I still think this is their best! The music on this album is a lot mellower compared to some of their earlier work. It's totally unique compared to the likes of Korn, Limp Bizkit, and Linkin Park but just as entertaining to listen to. I would recommend this album to anyone looking for something different from what is the norm in alternative rock today or just some great music to kick back to.
B000001FDK|5.0|I recieved this album on cassette way back in 1979(after hearing the music on the radio and seeing the movie)....and I've listened to it every year since then.  A perfect mix of oldies from the 50's and originals written for the film.  John Travolta has never been more appealing on record(before or since) and Olivia showed us.....well, she just plain old showed us she can do anything she wants to musically.  &quot;Hopelessly Devoted To You&quot; is beautifully sung by Newton-John and beautifully penned and produced by John Farrar.....I think of all the songs on this album THAT is the one I love the most......&quot;You're The One that I Want&quot; is still a lot of fun and unforgettable as well.  The title track written by the Bee Gees and sung by Frankie Valli instantly takes me back to the good old days and makes me want to watch the movie for the zillionth time......this cd is like an old friend to me and it has never let me down!
B000063DIR|4.0|Even though it's not the &quot;original masterpiece&quot; it's still a masterpiece.  Trujillo and Bordin are 2 very talented musicians and they prove this (not only being on tour with Ozzy) on this album.  They do not harm the album in anyway.  Only buy it if you're a collector or a diehard Ozzy fan.
0812548094|4.0|I remember being absolutely obsessed with this series...even missed a couple nights sleep because they were so hard to put down. The first book (Wizard's First Rule) especially was mindblowing - fast paced, action filled and (seemingly) original.<br />Soon afterwards, I went through a new phase...I hated the books with a passion. The plagiarism was terrible, the porno extremely uncalled for, and the plot was overly exaggerated. <br />However, I have now reached a middle ground. There really are some amazing sections in the books - completely original and heartrending. As for the rest, if you haven't read the Wheel of Time series, you'll be fine - if you have, then try to be a little open-minded...I guess in these times, it's difficult to come up with a complete fantasy world without recycling other's works (although Robin Hobb managed it with ease).<br />I rounded up my 3.5 to 4 stars<br />give it a go!
B00005NVDI|4.0|Okay, so I missed the fact that both of these episodes include frequent Batman guest stars, but that was only because I was so overwhelmed with the emotional subtext of each episode.<br />By now, any Trekker can tell you that \\"Let that be your last Battlefield\\" was a thinly veiled cautionary story about racial violence.  Not playing obvious favorites between the two antagonists - the fugitive Lokei, and his pursuer, Bele (Frank Gorshin) - the script quickly boils down their anamosity to pure hate.  The script tosses in some references - Lokei's people were once held a tier below Bele's, but received less than sincere aid as redress; also we'd sympathize with Lokei who was running - but soon blurs them to assure us that nothing really compensates for their shared hatred.  In the end, Lokei and Bele return to their burned world - with the camera uncharacteristically bleeding in imagery of burned out cities.<br />In \\"That Which Survives\\", the landing party (this is classic Trek, man - there are no \\"away teams\\") beams down to a strangely undynamic world. Unfortunately, the planet is actually a spaceship with its own built-in security system - one capable of flinging the Enterprise across the sector and marooning the landing party.  The system also takes the form of Losira (Lee Meriwether), a the last of the race of aliens who built the planet.  Both the landing party and the crew back on the Enterprise piece together the clues to the nature of the artificial planet and the ghost image that can inflict a very real death on anybody it finds (by \\"disrupting\\" every cell of her victims with but a touch; I've seen this episode a million times and I still don't know what \\"cellular disruption\\" means, but I'm sure it's got to be pretty bad).  Yeah, this is another one of those episodes about an ancient or otherwise high-powered computer that achieves sentience (\\"ultimate computer\\", \\"Changeling\\", \\"Return of the Archons\\", \\"For the World is Hollow\\") and the end is again a bit of comedown (Spock to the rescue with a phaser) but the script creates one of the series's more intriguing example of artificial intelligence - you keep thinking that she'll cry before she has to kill somebody.  The real Losira, the crew decides, must have been some woman.  Luckily in recreating her, the computer copied her too well.  (The same concept appears in the first Trek movie). Watch this trek, but make sure ypu've got something light and funny to back it up with Harry Mud or \\"A Piece of the Action\\".
6303418287|4.0|Mary Shelley's Frankenstein, the novel,  was so boring compared to this movie. This movie brings the story out more; more action, more detail. It also exaggerates some of the scenes a little but, that's okay. The novel was boring the whole way  through until you hit the end. I think you should see the movie instead of the book. You'll enjoy the movie better, the novel makes the whole story a little corny, if you ask me. The movie catches your eye from the beginning to the end. Robert DeNiro played a good role, I didn't even know it was him at first.<BR> <BR>I highly recommend this movie to anyone interested in seeing it. It keeps your attention by leaving you guessing a little, waiting to see what happens next. I liked the twisted part when Victor(Kenneth Branagh) brings his wife back to life by creating her with different body parts. That really caught my eye, I just wished they showed a little more than what they did. As far as the killing went, they could have showed him killing them instead of leaving it blank and we just catch the part when their dead. The only time they didn't really do it was when Justine died and Elizabeth(Helena Bonham Carter's).  I really think that you should watch this movie and see why I like it so much.
076780421X|4.0|If light-hearted romantic comedies are your thing, then this is a must see, because it fits the genre perfectly.  Matthew Perry shows very little range, simply playing Chandler without the rest of his friends.  It's not necessarily a knock on his acting prowess, he's simply delivering what the part called for.  Salma is as enticing as ever, and as a result, the chemistry suffers a little.  Chandler, all smarm and no charm, doesn't seem to deserve a woman as spectacular as Isabel (Salma).  The awkward chemistry doesn't necessarily take anything away from the film, but it doesn't really add any punch, either.  Chandler's parents actually bring a lot to the table in this film, especially his afternoon-alcoholic mother.  The incredible final scene, complete with Elvis in the background, is one of the finest scenes ever captured on film.  It is a beautiful, hilltop wedding which singlehandedly promotes this film from three to four stars.
B0000524CY|5.0|... I just saw The Exorcist with my dad this week.  I was very excited because I thought I was going to get the [feces] scared out of me, but I was very disappointed!  But you have to admit, when she spinned her head around in a full circle that was awesome!!!!!!!!!!  Even though I didnt get scared that much I still give it a ***** star rating!  Mabey it is just because I ... do not understand it to the full.
B000002BUY|5.0|g'damn this cd is awesome.  My cousin had it, and she told me to listen to it.  Obviously i was blown away by songs like &quot;A certain shade of green&quot; and &quot;New skin.&quot;  When i got home I walked to the music store and bought it.  I have some friends who aren't Incubus fans at all, but when they listened to this cd they changed their minds.  I would reccomend this cd to anyone who likes anything.
0452281881|5.0|Wah hah hah!<br />I am glad my office is less e-mail dependent than my home life. This book was impossible for me to stop reading. And all the unexpected little turns and ever present two-faced handlings - the book was a blast.
0440219078|1.0|Maybe the best book I've ever read in my life...until it reaches the ending. The most dissapointing feeling i ever had in my life as a reader was getting to the point of the book where i was in love with it and realizing that there were 15-20 pages left in which what i felt was the beginning of the book would have to be ended.<BR>It was criminal. The most ungodly ending i have ever read ruined a piece of literal art. It almost seemed as if Lowry just got to a point in the book where she just got bored with the book and looked to end it. It was like ending Romeo and Juliet with the families reconciling and the two living happily ever after. Killed the book altogether and I'm furious that i was robbed of a possible legendary novel and a reading experience by an ending that just seemed effortless, giving up on an amazing concept. Sad almost.
B00005YXZH|5.0|I have been a fan of Wilco since their inception (prior to that I was a huge Uncle Tupelo fan).  When Wilco released their first album AM, I thought, there were some decent tracks but that it lacked a bit in the way of substance.  Their follow-up &quot;Being There&quot; was an absolute surprise, and really close to a masterpiece.  It was then I began to tune into Tweedy's genius and I was better able to appreciate his songs from the Tupelo days.  It was evident then that Tweedy was maturing as a song writer.  <BR>The album Yankee Hotel Foxtrot exhibits Jeff's willingness to push himself and his music, and more exciting was the fact that Wilco's original record label felt the album was not commerical enough, so the band bought the rights to the album and shopped it around looking for another label.  <BR>I have been listening to the album for a few months, and it is nothing like what Wilco has released before.  Tracks like &quot;I am trying to break your heart&quot;, &quot;Kamera&quot; and &quot;Radio Cure&quot; provide a nice cross-section of what you can expect.  &quot;Radio Cure&quot; is moody and dark and yet the chorus contains elements of hope.  Seeing it live put that track into a completely different light.  &quot;Kamera&quot; sounds a bit like pop, but the lyrics are deep.  <BR>All in all, Tweedy's song writing has never been better, he continues to put himself out there, but he is not as straight forward as he used to be, I find myself needing to dig a little deeper into the metaphors and similies. Ultimately, I think people will find that he still refuses to censor himself.
B000003CMC|4.0|\\"Eat a Peach\\" is the best album of the Allman Brothers without all live material.  While it is known for carryovers from the 1971 Fillmore East live performances, it is also highlighted by three studio recordings of country songs employing acoustic guitar and with very pretty textures, including \\"Melissa\\" and the instrumental \\"Little Martha.\\"  In the gorgeous \\"Blue Sky,\\" the acoustic guitar is mostly subsumed by a beautiful signature, a pretty verseline, and very sweet electric guitar work.  The last two songs feature excellent guitar duets between Duane Allman and Dickie Betts that were the last moments of glory for Duane, who died tragically in a motorcycle accident before the studio recordings were completed, and thus is not on a number of the tracks. <br />Still, the best song is \\"One Way Out,\\" with its catchy blues motif reminiscent of \\"You Don't Love Me\\" and fabulous guitar soloing.  It would have held a place of honor had it been included on the group's legendary album Live at Fillmore East. \\"Les Brers in A Minor\\" is a patchwork piece of music with a cool motif in its middle part, and \\"Trouble No More\\" has a great opening signature.  The catchy riffs in the three songs are distinctive Allman Brothers grooves, instantly recognizable as the magic Allman Brothers sound.  The first and last of these songs are among the live recordings.  The other live track is \\"Mountain Jam,\\" a more-than-30-minute exercise in which Duane Allman and Dickie Betts perform good guitar duals.  <br />Altho \\"Brothers and Sisters,\\" recorded shortly afterward, was a decent effort, things were never quite the same without Duane, who stands as one of the greatest guitarists in rock history.  The rest of the group are also master musicians, but as in the case of The Beatles, this legendary rock group was worth more as a whole than the sum value of its individual parts.  Duane and Dickie both on guitar, and combined with the rest, was that ever something.
B00005JKCF|5.0|This is the best movie i have seen all year. Its the movie I recommend seeing its the best. You have got to see it, its great. Tobey Maguire is great on it.
B00005JKCF|5.0|I've been a fan of the Spider-Man comics since I was 3 years old, so I had great expectations for Sam Raimi's film adaptation. I'm happy to say that I wasn't let down....<br />   Tobey maguire stars as high-school science nerd Peter Parker, who is bitten by a genetically altered spider and finds himself with the ability to cling to walls, make tremendous leaps, sense danger, shoot webs, etc. He decides to cash in on his powers by becoming a pro wrestler, but fate has other things in store for our young hero. A personal tragedy teaches him that \\"With great power, comes great responsibility\\".<br />  Enter billionaire industrialist Norman Osborne: desperate to make the breakthrough that will enable his company to keep a lucrative government contract, he makes himself the test subject of his own strength-enhancement formula. The strength aspect works, but the added bonus is the addition of another personality: The murderous Green Goblin, who takes it upon himself to dispose of Norman's enemies.<br />  The Goblin is on a rampage through Manhattan when he runs up against Spidey for the first time. He senses a kindred spirit in Spidey, and attempts to enlist him as a partner. Barring that, he'll just kill him.....LET'S GET READY TO RUMBLEEEEEEEEEEE!!!<br />   I sat through Spider-Man with a HUGE grin on my face; It's JUST like the comic-Book. Fans will be thrilled by the obvious love Director Raimi has for the source material, and non-fans will appreciate the fact that Raimi delivers a rock-solid action movie without resorting to the usual comic-book movie campiness.<BR>Comic fans will also revel in the many appearances of classic Spidey characters such as Mendel Stromm, J. Jonah Jameson (A superb J.K. Simmons), Betty Brant, Flash Thompson, etc., as well as mentions of Dr. Conners and Daily Bugle photographer, who in the books become villains The Lizard and Venom, respectively. Raimi regular Bruce Campbell is hilarious as the Ring Announcer in the wrestling sequence, and Kirsten Dunst shines as love interest Mary Jane Watson; It's easy to see how Peter is smitten with her. Willem Dafoe walks a thin line as the homicidal Goblin, and he nevr crosses the line between insanity and hamminess. Maguire delivers a star-making performance as the hapless teen who rises to the occasion by becoming the hero the city so desperately needs. Kudos to Raimi for using real N.Y.C locations; The city has never looked better! My only beef with the film is the Goblin's mask: It's immobility is kind of jarring when Dafoe is talking.....<br />  All in all, Spider-Man is, in my opinion, the best Comic Book movie EVER, bar none! (Be on the lookout for cameos by Lucy Lawless and Stan Lee, Spidey's co-creator. And stick around through the credits to hear the catchy theme song from the 60's catroon!)
B00005S8FC|4.0|This album shows how disparate musical worlds can blend seamlessly when treated with respect and good taste. The music takes the listener to a utopical place somewhere between Paris and Buenos Aires.<BR>By the way, the bellowed instrument that we hear on this record IS NOT an accordion, but a bandoneon ( a german instrument originally used as a replacement for small churches that did not have an organ that somehow made it to Buenos Aires and became the soul for tango).
0345448898|5.0|This trilogy was absolutely amazing. I could never put it down! The way Pullman writes makes you get really attached to the characters.The endings were totally amazing! I honestly found Harry Potter really boring compared to this trilogy and everyone has to read these books!!! I have read many books since these ones and none of them have kept me in suspense as much as this trilogy!!!
B00005RG6M|5.0|This latest DVD-Audio is truly great, especially if you are a fan of Queen's music.  The sound is at 96kHz on all mixes and is crystal clear.  Brian May's guitars sound especially good - there is a lot of clarity and depth to all of the chords (I have found that guitars especially sound very much better on DVD-A).  I listened in a quiet (but not insulated) room and there is no background hiss, which happens sometimes with older recordings.<br />The 5.1 speakers are used extensively on all songs.  Sounds will be behind you, to the sides, and some actually sounded above me.  The mix really shows off the possibilities of the format, but without subtracting from the music - the mix fits each song very well.<br />I recommend this disc if you want to experience full use of 5.1 speakers, are a Queen fan, or both.
B00005AQGH|5.0|Pac is my favorite rapper ever. I think he is the realest [person] out there and this album gets in touch with the heart of a true thug.<BR>Tupac Amaru Shakur A.K.A. Makaveli REST IN PEACE
B00003CXXP|1.0|This was one of the worst movies my husband and I have watched together.  The first 45 minutes or so were okay, but the second half and especially the ending dragged on ridiculously and became less and less credible with the passing of each agonizing moment.  When it ended, we both look at each other and laughed at what a total waste of time it was.  Neither of us could believe that we actually sat through it hoping that it would get better.  Needless to say, we expected much more from both the director and the cast.
B00005JKCF|5.0|I took my seat in the cinema expecting to be disappointed. I wanted Spider-man to be special, but like many big movies in recent years, the potential of the source material was never realised when translated to the big screen. Well, I was anything but disappointed. If you love Spider-man then you'll love this movie. If you don't know anything about Spider-man, you'll love this movie. I watched this with my wife and daughter, both of whom I had to drag with me. My wife did not fancy watching a movie based on a comic book, and my daughter, aged 8, didn't really know who Spider-man is. Both loved this movie. We all loved this movie. Sam Raimi has delivered as much as could be expected. The movie isn't perfect, but its close. Yes, at times the pace slows, but that is required to develop character relationships, after all this is a movie not a computer game. The CGI is at times obvious, especially when Peter Parker is first enjoying his new found abilities, but that is forgiven by the totally awesome closing sequence. Just before the end titles, there is a final sequence showing Spidey, up close, swinging through New York which is truly amazing, and in my opinion flawless.<br />From the acting standpoint Tobey Maguire really delivers, as does Willem Defoe. This was such an enjoyable two hours, that I am going to see it again tonight, and I just can't wait to see that closing sequence again.
B00005JKCF|5.0|This movie can be described in one word: Spectacular. The special effects are not to be believed. Though the movie's music is vaguely reminiscent of Batman, I was not all that bothered.<br />The Green Goblin outfit was annoying, and somewhat corny. That was the only problem I could find with the whole movie (ok, that and Kirsten Dunst's lines, she should have fired the person who wrote her part of the script.)<br />All in all, GREAT movie.
B00005JKCF|4.0|Spider-Man... Would I see the movie agian, yes! Would I have picked other actors to play the two lead roles Mary-Jane Watson and Peter Parker, yes. Ok... maybe not for the part of Mary-Jane, but for the part of Peter Parker, yes. Maguire wasn't a bad choice he just made the character look sickly to me. Casting could have picked another Spider-Man/Peter Parker.<br />I did enjoy the computer graphics animation. The movie is definately worth a look at on the big screen. Very action packed. Though I gave this movie 4 stars that does not do it justice. On a scale of 1-10. This movie is an 8 1/2.<br />Recommend! However could be scary for young fans.
B00005OWEG|4.0|Apocalypse Now is definitely one of those films that people either &quot;get&quot; or don't.  I am with the crowd that considers it one of the great film achievements of the 20th century.  I agree with the many folks who have commented critically that this DVD should have included extras (beyond the extra footage), but I am very pleased with the quality of the print and the transfer to DVD.  The color saturation is fantastic.  I'll have to look into the criticisms that aspect ratio is incorrect.
B00005JKCF|1.0|I didn't go in the movie theatre expecting a lot, and even those expectations did not stand for long. The special effects - the only strength that this movie could have - were corny and cliched. What tops them all is the shot of peter climbing on the \\"wall\\" - clearly he was climbing on the floor and thd shot was on its side. The characters? Again, cliche after cliche. Bad guys look evil, good guys look like saints. And don't even get me started on the green goblin - was that supposed to be funny? The dialogue was horrible too... Don't see this movie. Maybe if I were a spidey fan i would think twice, but since i'm not - here it is.
B00005YXZH|4.0|If you are unfamiliar with Wilco and are curious about this album because of all the hype surrounding it, then try listening to it first at your local music store before you consider purchasing. You'll notice that most of the reviews here are either 5 stars or 1 star. Most 5 star reviewers are temporarily entranced by the album's unique sounds and overall aesthetic slant and are incapable of writing an &quot;objective&quot; review (if that's possible for anyone to do). In contrast, The 1-star reviewers are people who feel challenged by the hype surrounding the album and go too far in criticising it. There's no way that a 1-star reviewer really hates every song on this album. No one with a pulse and a brain stem could deny that &quot;I am trying to break your heart&quot; and &quot;I'm the man who loves you&quot; aren't wonderful and appealing pop (or post-alt.country, if you prefer meaningless, pseudo-intellectual musical categories) experiments.<br />Chances are you'll like at least half of the songs, if not more. Whether you appreciate the experimental radio effects and Jeff Tweedy's unique vocal style is mostly a matter of personal taste. <br />And please, forget the tedious arguments about whether this album is the &quot;next great thing&quot; and just enjoy the music.
B00005YXZH|4.0|Its actually more like 4.5 stars.  From reading magazine articles I found out that Wilco's previous record label refused to release this album becuase they thought it was too experimental and &quot;uncommercial&quot;.  Because of those reviews I thought Wilco had gone to the hinterlands in terms of their artistic creativity.  Kinda like when Radiohead relesed OK Computer after the Bends.  A total 180 degrees turnaround.  However, after listening to the album I really don't understand where all the fuzz about this album being a difficult record to listen too!!  YHF is still Wilco!  This album is not much different form their previous releases.  If I were to compare it to a previous album it would be compared to &quot;Being There&quot; which until this album (YHF) was probally their best album.  YHF is a great album it continues from where Being There left off.  However, if you've read reviews about this album being unaccesible and difficult to listen too... don't belive the hype.  This is Wilco's best album to date.  I'm a big fan of experimental rock such as Tortise (also from Chicago) but belive me this is not one of them!  Its halfway there... and I could see the next album being there if Tweedy continue to push the band's limits!  More power to Tweedy.  Continue to push the boundaries of Wilco and we'll keep on buying!
B00005JKCF|3.0|Peter Parker was such a nice boy with a very nice Aunt and Uncle.  It was a storybook family picture, which was refreshing.  The part of the movie that turned me off, was the disrespect that Peter showed his Uncle in one scene.  The love and support Peter got from his Aunt and Uncle was not worthy of the comment Peter made to his Uncle about don't try to be my father.  The writers could have thought of a much more noble reason for \\"OUR HERO\\",Spider-man, to seek revenge.  Disrespecting people in authority is rampant in this country amongst our youth, and portraying Peter Parker as having this same disrespectful attitude was unnecessary.  Aside from that issue, the storyline as a whole was lame.  It was lacking in creativity and villians.  Since the end of the movie was inviting to a sequel, my suggestion is to start the team of writers brainstorming now, so that Spidey II doesn't come across as being written in a day.
B000002KIE|5.0|This is the definition of punk.  The Ramones invented it, the Sex Pistols gave it the attitude, and the Clash polished it.  Johnny Rotten's thoughts on communism, abortion, and EMI? What more could you ask for?
B000055X3U|2.0|though most would disagree judgement was certainly a huge disapointment. what made it worse was members being so comfortable with their work that they had to slag their earlier and better albums and other bands off . For most of the people this was the album where anathema truly reached the musical godhead and made their masterpiece. It's kinda ironic that when bands state that they've found themselves and that they have ignored the strict limitations of metal genre they start to make ordinary rock music that's been done thousands of times before. Songs on offer aren't fresh or exciting.&quot;the silent enigma&quot; and &quot;alternative 4 &quot; owed a lot to &quot;pandemonium&quot;-era celtic frost (TSE) and pink floyd (A4) but they were still great albums full of good songs, memoarable passages and interesting lyrics. <BR>there's nothing that wrong with this album but i think it lacks anykind of emotional power or sincierity. there's a song about every single human failure or problem like alcoholism, broken relationships, loneliness. If they really are sinciere it seems that their way to deal with these topics is as deep and heartfelt as that of mariah carey's. i'm sorry for the lads not getting that commercial breakthrought they hoped for with this album because there's not much else they could have achieved with it.
6305165912|5.0|Simply put, I love this movie, and so does everyone else I've ever spoken to about it.  It's impossible to describe this movie, because of it's pure strangeness.  On the most basic level, it's the story of a man trying to get his rug replaced after some kidknappers pee on it.  More than that though, it's a journey through a strange and troubling vision of modern california, its bowling alleys, nad low-rent housing.  It's the story of The Dude, a hero who does nothing but &quot;abide.&quot;  If you haven't seen this movie, watch it.  If you don't own it, what are you waiting for?
B00004Y6NX|5.0|Two years later the legendary \\"Making Movies\\"  and after touring the world for 24 months , Dire Straits come back to studio, where they did record stuff to release one double album that became one, since that Mark Knopfler was (for the first time) the only producer for a DS work. Five songs for a total time of 42 minutes show that Dire Straits want to put an end to the entertaining rock'n roll of Making Movies. The first single was the misleading \\"Private Investigations\\", where the Mark's acoustic guitar and soundtrack's atmosphere flow into each other nearly to display that Dire Straits' music can still demonstrate here are many aspects you can grasp.<BR>\\"Telegraph Road\\"'s 14 minutes represent the new imagine that the band wants to catch, the alternation between the rests and musical breaks, less singing, songs get swell, a dimension remanding to the 70's format of the song. \\"Industrial Disease\\" (the more rhythmic episode of the album) where you hear half tones and underground melodies and the entire band goes on with the talk they interruptedwith \\"Skateaway\\". The title-track is a song based on the Mark's acoustic guitar brillianthims and the rest of the group gives the decorative support to the leader the final introspective and velvety solemn gait of \\"It Never Rains\\" closes this album, and I (as you and a great deal of rock connoisseurs) cannot help labeling it a masterpiece.
B00005V3Z4|5.0|The first time I saw Donnie Darko was on my Laptop in my office with the lights turned off and no one arround to distract me. I had no idea what the movie was about, it was recomended to me by a friend and Im one of those types who hates reading the back of the dvd box because it spoils stuff. When the movie was over I had gone through a rollercoaster of emotions, and I wasn't quite sure what I felt at the end... all I knew was that it was powerful. I didn't talk for another hour or so, I just thought about the movie.<br />I don't want to tell you anything about the story itself, learning about everything is part of the experience. Its very wierd, yes, but its origonal, and it tells a story not many other directors would attempt to tell. Its open to interpretation. Its beautiful. If the story seems wierd at the beginning, it is. But let yourself be drawn into the movie, and wait it out. You won't be dissapointed.<br />As for the people who try to classify this movie into genres, this movie dosen't follow those guidelines. Its a mishmash of all sorts of emotions and stories. But it works, it never feels skitzophrenic.<br />The soundtrack, by the way, is steller. Check it out.
6305499365|5.0|I have never had an office job in my life and I still love this movie.  I've watched it over and over and it's still hilarious.  The Godfather-esque printer scene is a classsic in its own right, and the witty jokes fly by at record speed.  You have to see this movie a few times before you catch al of them.  The characters are all cast perfectly and Judge does a great job of making the office seem like hell (Nina is especially annoying).  Overall a great movie.
B00000IN5G|1.0|people tend to hype this album and I for one can't see the point. Mixing pseudo-techninal playing, mindless baroque passages and guitar jerking with two-dimensional use of extreme metal tricks isn't my idea of what metal or music in general should be. The songs lack any natural flow and what's more important, the songs are simply bad with few nice riffs here and there. <br />I don't mind technical playing but I wan't to hear it performed by bit more professional individuals. Drumplaying on this record is simply embarrasing when compared to some truly imagative and technical players like hoglan, reinert or indeed any of the guys in Death. <br />It's kinda ridiculous that there's still need to overuse and abuse these tired classical music manners. some bands manage to combine these two different worlds in their music but making it an excuse for pathetic soloing is hardly that imaginative.<br />last but not least is laiho's horrible vocals that are said to be performed in \\"black metal\\" way. The vocals aren't one bit brutal or aggressive and most bm bands' vocals are way better.  Extreme vocals are done badly are only an excuse for not finding a proper singer. The lyrics are about teenage angst without even a hint of anything called self-irony<br />\\"iron maiden meets emperor\\" is hardly accurate as even the good ol' irons are far more aggressive, techinal and in a word better than bodom. Emperor's mixture of extreme metal heroics and classical bombasm is superior and i feel bothered when i even have to mention these two bands in the same paragraph. \\"match rock of dream theater meets europe's ear for lame...melodism with your oh so angry teenage brother on vocals\\" more likely
B00005JKCF|1.0|We had heard that, despite its PG-13, rating, Spider-Man was a movie for the whole family.  So, I brought my 8 and 5 year old boys expecting a nice family evening out with them.<br />My idea of a nice evening out with my boys does not include watching loved ones get blown up, a villian gleefully trying to kill a group of children and people getting shot up.<br />Why on earth wasn't this movie rated R?  We wonder why our children are killing each other in school, but yet we happily take them to movies, at age 13, that show terrible violence that does abolutely nothing to enhance a story!  What does that say about us.<br />For me, I brought my kids to this movie not expecting what I saw and I will never bring them to a PG-13 picture again (even Disney PG-13 movies have not been suitable).<br />Why this movie is so popular, I don't know.  It was your typical action hero saves the day (although there wasn't a sceen in the movie where the audience cheered), nerd beats up the bully and loser gets girl.  After watching this movie, I was disturbed by its gratuitous violence, but otherwise felt unmoved by storyline and its characters.<br />The movie never manages to bring you in to it.  You are left as an observer watching the characters and the situations and therefore are uninvolved and unmoved.<br />If you have kids under 13, definately do NOT take them to see this movie.  Even if they are 13+, I would think twice about what messages you want your kids to learn.

0684847817|5.0|If anything, it is Brian Froud's artwork to be amazed about. He pays special attention to the fine art of the drawing of fairies and it literally took my breath away. What a great addition it would make to one's library. I loved his previous works too. The descriptions are apt and delicious to read about. snuggle in and enjoy a great read and stunning pictures.
0440211727|5.0|In the rural town of Clanton, Mississippi, Tonya Hailey, a ten-year-old, girl is brutally raped by two drunken young men. The men are arrested, but before their trial, the girl's father, Carl Lee, takes justice into his own hands with an M-16 rifle. In John Grisham's best selling novel, A Time To Kill, Carl Lee's attorney and friend, Jake Brigance, must come up with a plausible defense in order to save his clients life. After all, some might consider Carl Lee's actions completely justified. There's one serious problem however--Carl Lee is black, and the two men he murdered were white. This doesn't fly in the moderately racist county, and soon the Ku Klux Klan is threatening Jake's life. Grisham's novel is wonderfully gripping. At 515 pages, it may seem a bit intimidating to some, but the action and development is constant. I myself generally prefer a quick read, but there is so much fascinating depth to this story that I had no problem with reading it over the course of a few weeks. Granted, it was so powerful I would have loved to just sit down and read it straight through, if only I had the free time. I would recommend this book to almost everyone, as it is truly a remarkable book. If you are a southerner who is easily offended by being considered racist, you may have some qualms with this book. Other than that, I can think of little reason for anyone to not read it.
0066620996|5.0|I like this book about innovative thinking.  My investment hero is Warren Buffett, and he thinks as a &quot;defensive pessimist&quot; -- I wish more corporate executives, stockbrokers, and individual investors would follow his lead.  Unrealistic optimism and habitual, easy thinking turn good companies bad; to become great, think differently.  That is why I recommend the book &quot;The Positive Power of Negative Thinking&quot; by Julie Norem. Warren Buffett has demonstrated how well contrary opinion thinking works over the long term.
6303418287|3.0|A lot of people say that this film is the closest in comparison to the novel, I beg to differ!! Yes, the movie does meet some of the standards set by the novel. Yet, a lot of the movie is bad compared to the book. There is a lot added to the movie to make it more dramatic. Like when Elizabeth (Helena Bonham Carter) is killed and Victor (Kenneth Branagh) takes her body and gives her life again (which is what started all the trouble in the first place with the creature). Then she has to chose between Victor and the Creature (Robert de Niro), Finally she breaks a lamp over her head and sets herself and the house on fire. The movie has some good effects and good actors, but the following of the story is bad! I would definitely recommend reading the book before even wasting your time with this movie.
0684833395|5.0|Joseph Heller writes Catch-22 to show how abusrd and pointless the idea of war is.  Yossarian is an American bomber in Europe during WWII.  Being sane and intelligent Yossarian tries to get out of his duty to stay in the war as a bomber.  He tries to use the idea that he is insane and get a letter from the doctor to prevent him from flying.  The doctor says if you are insane, then they have to ground you and anyone who is flying in the war and doesn't try to get out is insane, but the minute you want to stop flying or get out of the war, you are sane so you have to continue to fly.<br />The characters in this book also portray how in a war you have some people that are only looking out for themselves and want to make a profit.  One character in particular who sticks out is named Milo Minderbinder.  Milo will do anything in order to make a profit.  And, &quot;with Minderbinder enterprises everyone owns a share.&quot;  But when someone wants to claim that share they get an interesting surprise.  Overall Catch-22 is an amazing book and is a must read in order to know where the phrase Catch-22 comes from.
B000002LFU|4.0|One more thing- Micheal Stipe's lyrics, usually inaudible or cryptic or both, are actually relatively straightforward this time around. One exception is &quot;Orange Crush&quot;- I didn't realize what that one was about until someone told me it was about Agent Orange. Once I knew, it made sense(?) Still, it doesn't seem to be the most effective possible critique of the use of Agent Orange, although &quot;Follow me/don't follow me&quot; and &quot;We are agents of the free&quot; are good lines. My favourite lyrics on this album are &quot;You are the Everything&quot;, and &quot;The Wrong Child&quot;- not terribly ambiguous, but very evocative. The fact that they are both vignettes from childhood might partly explain their power and appeal.
B00005QZWI|5.0|When I purchased the soundtrack to The Lord of the Rings, it was only because Enya's &quot;May It Be&quot; was on the CD.  After hearing the whole sountrack however, I ended up playing the rest of the songs just as much as &quot;May It Be.&quot;  Though some of the songs are dark and pounding (reflective of their corresponding scenes in the movie), most are extremely enlightening and relaxing.  I love the whimsical air of the CD, and can even picture hobbits doing a jig to the clear tone of the flute present in many songs.  I would definately recomend this product to anyone who likes Enya and that relaxed, melodic style of music.
6300214184|4.0|Don't get this wrong, for I loved Flashdance.  I just noticed that the story didn't ever get a whole lot of substance to it.  There should have been a stronger personal plot and more setbacks.  Still, when you consider the love which this movie was made with and how Beals overcame her problems through determination.  <br />Basically, a young girl who works steel by day and dances in bars at night aspires to become a ballet professional.  She doesn't, however, have formal training.  But can she do it just through willpower alone?  You'll have to see.  <br />It's too bad that Flashdance didn't do better than it did, especially when Footloose was much more successful.  Films like this were just a bit out of synch with the big sellers at the time.  I don't know what was with this one.  Maybe it was a more mainstream soundtrack, maybe the better plot development, or maybe Kevin Bacon himself, although Jennifer Beals is plenty convincing to me...
0684833395|5.0|Joseph Heller writes Catch-22 to show how abusrd and pointless the idea of war is.  Yossarian is an American bomber in Europe during WWII.  Being sane and intelligent Yossarian tries to get out of his duty to stay in the war as a bomber.  He tries to use the idea that he is insane and get a letter from the doctor to prevent him from flying.  The doctor says if you are insane, then they have to ground you and anyone who is flying in the war and doesn't try to get out is insane, but the minute you want to stop flying or get out of the war, you are sane so you have to continue to fly.<br />The characters in this book also portray how in a war you have some people that are only looking out for themselves and want to make a profit.  One character in particular who sticks out is named Milo Minderbinder.  Milo will do anything in order to make a profit.  And, &quot;with Minderbinder enterprises everyone owns a share.&quot;  But when someone wants to claim that share they get an interesting surprise.  Overall Catch-22 is an amazing book and is a must read in order to know where the phrase Catch-22 comes from.
B000002LFU|4.0|This was a transitional album for REM- not only were they making the change from indie-label artists (with IRS) to major label artists, but they were also in the process of changing their sound. For the first time, we hear mandolin as the lead instrument on the songs \\"You Are the Everything\\", \\"The Wrong Child\\", and \\"Hairshirt\\"- three of the album's best and most poignant songs. In the midst of all this change, however, we end up with a rather uneven album- some great songs, some pretty good songs, and a couple that are not so good. \\"Document\\" had been a hard rocking, sometimes harsh sounding album. Here they maintained some of the high noise level while adding on some catchy hooks and pretty harmonies on \\"Bubble gum heavy metal\\" songs like \\"Get Up\\" (the first REM song with clear Beach Boys influence, plus music boxes for a bridge!), \\"Orange Crush\\" (a great rocking tune, sounds a bit like U2) and, less interestingly, \\"I Rembember California\\". The album ends on an upbeat note with an untitled song which is quite catchy.
B0000029GA|5.0|This album is so real, so true, so pure that words can't describe. Nas blends his beautiful, poetic lyrics with some of this era's best producers (Premo, Large Professor, Pete Rock) over 9 tracks of 100% sheer brilliance. Not one song will disappoint the true hip hop head. If you are not familiar with Nas' work or have only heard newer material, do not let him fool you, this album is classic. Nas, altough still a fairly good MC, fails to show his true skill on his later work. Showing only glimpses of his old self on his other albums. If you don't have this CD be sure to pick it up now, TIMELESS.
6300214184|4.0|Don't get this wrong, for I loved Flashdance.  I just noticed that the story didn't ever get a whole lot of substance to it.  There should have been a stronger personal plot and more setbacks.  Still, when you consider the love which this movie was made with and how Beals overcame her problems through determination.  <br />Basically, a young girl who works steel by day and dances in bars at night aspires to become a ballet professional.  She doesn't, however, have formal training.  But can she do it just through willpower alone?  You'll have to see.  <br />It's too bad that Flashdance didn't do better than it did, especially when Footloose was much more successful.  Films like this were just a bit out of synch with the big sellers at the time.  I don't know what was with this one.  Maybe it was a more mainstream soundtrack, maybe the better plot development, or maybe Kevin Bacon himself, although Jennifer Beals is plenty convincing to me...
6305546789|5.0|The first time I saw Halloween as a youth I was genuinely petrified.  Okay, now I know the ending but I find this movie the summit of horror movie making.  Its classic rise to status from a low-budget production to a multi-million $$$ industry & cultural influence (both of the horror genre & indeed of movie-making) is now legendary.  However nothing is as legendary nor as grandiose as the movie's 3 principal influences. 1. Its creation of the most inemotive serial killer ever, Michael Myers/The Shape. 2. Its creation of the classic ''scream queen'' through the divinely brilliant Jamie-Lee Curtis, whose ingenuity renders her trauma all the more startling as she is pursued by Michael (unbeknown to her nor the audience that he is infact her brother) & heroically takes charge despite her fear. 3. The music.  Its simplicity is more chilling than The Exorcist (& is my ringtone on my cell phone!). On Black & White, 3 strands or themes seem quite simple for a movie, yet it's these lietmotiv which have not only ensured that this movie series has survived, but whose simplicity merely exercises a more profound influence on the audience, as it concentrates on simple techniques to scare audiences - & scare it does.  Myers appears out of nowhere at times.  His murder of his victims is as stark & inhuman as his mask, which ensures the audience cannot empathise with the Shape, because that's all he is in his boiler suit & white mask.  Curtis' screams are harrowing & Donald Pleasence's pursuit of Myers, his patient, is intent & passionate.  We feel Myers' evil through Pleasence's narrative of Myers' life in his care since brutally murdering his sister, makes Myers mythical in his insensitivity & brutality.  Carpenter & Hill's music, imagery (the dark sequences are eery) & dialogue synthesise to create what I can best describe as a discordant harmony.  A now classic movie which chills by its simplicity, brevity & determination.  Its classic status (along with its ''celebritisation'' of Myers as an anti-hero, & Curtis as the ultimate horror heroine) shall go on for years.  I can never tire of this movie.  Definitely worth purchase!of Myers as an anti-hero, & Curtis as the ultimate horror heroine) shall go on for years.  I can never tire of this movie.  Definitely worth purchase!
B000059ZLH|3.0|I love dream theater but dont understand what happened to them, Oh wait Kevin isn't in the band anymore and after that it went downhill. ...these guys went from pioneer's to followers in 4 years. Dream theater even admits to most of this in the special feature of the dvd where they provide commentary on the show. One after another they cited peices of their new music by naming names. For instance, The intro is [SO PINK FLOYD]and they say\\" Ok this is like floyd\\" \\"This is like yes\\" This part is like so and so\\" All of the new stuff are parts of supergroups that they [copied]. I dont understand where the originality went. Possibly with Kevin? Everything seemed to smell of Pink Floyd, yes, etc....Thank god Queensryches operation mindcrime exists because they did it right. When you embark on a \\"Concept\\" album create something new, Don't take parts of everyone else's music and storyline and make a DVD. This is great footage and sound but lacks originality.
0451527712|4.0|Can't sleep at night? Need something to rest your brain? Well, if you're looking for a nice, soothing book to read, I would not recommend Mary Shelley's Frankenstein. You may think, \\"Oh, it's just a story, it won't scare me.\\" Yeah, you think that now, but wait until you read it. This story is so freaky, it even scared me....and it takes a lot to freak me out. Everything about it-the creation of the demon, the creature's killing spree, everything-was just plain creepy. It was a good book, yes-but it was also just plain odd. So when you're reaching for a book before taking a little nap, I wouldn't recommend reaching for Frankenstein-unless, of course, you like being challenged and having a lot on your mind before bed.
B00005YXZH|4.0|Upon my first few listens of Yankee Hotel Foxtrot, I thought to myself &quot;oh no, they are relying too much on production and not enough on songs&quot;. However; after listening a few more times the songs became wedged in my brain, and I realized Jeff Tweedy is continuing his progression as one of America's finest songwriters. Yankee Hotel Foxtrot and Wilco are being a bit over-hyped at the moment, but that shouldn't dissuade you from buying this. It's not a classic, but it is a very strong record and a valuable addition to the Wilco discography.
B00005JKCF|4.0|Poor Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire).  He's an orphan, a put-upon science nerd, and has a lifelong crush on Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst), the troubled, yet beautiful, girl-next-door.  His only friend is rich kid Harry Osborn (James Franco), and his meagre support structure includes his laid-off Uncle Ben (Cliff Robertson) and Aunt May (Rosemary Harris).  While on a field trip, a genetically-altered spider bites him and...<BR><br />Spider-puberty!  Suddenly, Pete's got muscles and strange bodily emissions he has to keep hidden from his aunt and uncle.  The kid even starts blowing off household chores.  Of course, we know why.  He's turning into Spider-Man, the beloved hero created way back in 1962 by Stan Lee and Steve Ditko.  It took years to get this lovable loser to the screen.  Anticipation ran high.<BR><br />Fortunately, Sam Raimi's version delivers the goods... for the most part.  It's an action adventure film with heart, and remains remarkably faithful to the spirit of those original Lee/Ditko comics; even Spider-Man's victories are left-handed gifts from the gods.  What's really wonderful about it is that it spends so much time in its characters' heads, brings them to life not with shorthanded script cliches, but nuances and the smallest moments.  Maguire's Peter is a truly smart, nice guy who suffers from painful shyness, his positive qualities completely overlooked by his peers (whose hate for him is palpable in the early going, and not just there for color).  Maguire manages to you hurt for the character in a subtle way not often seen in big-budget malarkey.  And Dunst's MJ manages to be both vulnerable and sexy, wholesome yet dangerous.  With her screaming parents and her winsome smile, it's easy to see how someone like Peter Parker would develop a secret love for her, maybe heightened by his need to protect her from the heartbreaks her future will no doubt bring her.  And Cliff Robertson conveys the decency of a man who still believes in doing the rightthing, in being responsible, even as life slowly crushes him.<BR><br />It's in these very human, dramatic moments that it's easy to believe in these characters, but when the movie really needs to soar, when Peter Parker finds he's capable of amazing feats (wall-crawling, leaping, swinging from webs, sensing danger), we're shut out.  Peter really needs to open up and let loose (actually, so should the movie should), but instead of joie d'spider, we get a very unconvincing CGI mannequin.  We never get to sail along with Spidey in any real sense, and there's not enough veracity.  This is extremely odd, because usually it's the other way around- in the typical Hollywood blockbuster, we don't give a crap about the regular people; they get shorted so the hero can blow things up and toss off corny one-liners (something the comic Spidey does with aplomb, but rarely here).<BR><br />Another problem is the film's villain.  Willem Dafoe can play creepy, and he does make Norman Osborn (Harry's dad- look out Peter Parker!) suitably sympathetic as he slides into insanity.  It's just that the Green Goblin's suit, with its immobile countenance, looks more like a sleek costume for Rio's yearly Carneval than it does the garb of a madman bent on destruction.  Dafoe gets to make a few nefarious speeches, but instead of his fiercely angular face, we see the frozen rictus of a dimestore Halloween mask.  It becomes more of a voice performance, but keeps the Goblin from really coming to life.<BR><br />What's left is a very good film, tons of fun, and arguably the best super-hero flick since the first \\"Superman,\\" but one that comes so close to greatness that it's ultimately frustrating.  I can't fault them for plumping the soap opera; they reached for \\"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon\\" instead of \\"Armageddon\\" and any film that aspires to that, especially one that features a guy dressed like an insect, deserves props.  Too often giant films like this fall victim to gaudy excess, with explosions substituting for catharsis.  It's just that I enjoyed the Peter/Mary Jane/Harry scenes more than the Spidey scenes.  Most of them, anyway.  There's a moment in the middle of the film where Spidey's rescued MJ and tells her she knows him.  She's confused until he explains, \\"I'm your friendly neighborhood Spider-Man\\" in a bouyant tone, and for that moment, he's exactly right.
6303418287|1.0|If you have read Mary Shelley's Frankenstein and want to laugh, make sure you watch the 1994 release of Frankenstein. The plot is 60% different from the already great book and the added scenes are almost totally bad and pathetic. The only good addition is the scene where Elizabeth is recreated and realizes this and lights herself on fire. Then, she starts a `well-lit' romp through the house. The best part of this movie is the fire, in my opinion, and that's where this film should go. I believe that almost the entire movie, save the original creation scene, was humorous and incomparable to the book. It has a great score (Patrick Doyle), great acting talent (Robert DeNiro, Kenneth Branagh, Helena Bonham Carter) and great costuming. If not for the sub par plot, the film would have been great. In rating this book I will choose to use a great conversation from \\"The Simpsons.\\" <br />Editor: \\"9 thumbs up? What the hell is that?\\"<BR>Homer: \\"You're right, it's crap...1.5 thumbs up it is...\\"
6304308469|3.0|How odd, for Hollywood to make a movie about a Grand Hotel, set in Germany of all things!  And - what ?  No accents - [except for Garbo....]!  Yet, what delicious fun!<br />There's Wallace Beery as the boorish industrialist [shades of the great Emil Jannings], John Barrymore, not using cue-cards, but sporting that magnificent profile - somewhat enhanced by the make-up department,  and Garbo, who is initially quite irritating as the languid, almost over-the-hill prima ballerina, but it's then when you see how brilliant her acting choices actually are, and what a devine body.<br />Crawford?  Well, she positively steals the show with this very contemporary performance of a material girl on the way up - and what about the shoulders?  Legend states that the designer Adrian  - after reviewing her dimensions, invented the 'shoulder pad look' especially for her - making her shoulders 'wider than Johnny Weismullers'?  Not!  Her proportions are perfect!<br />Matter of taste though - but it's Crawford's subtle performance and look that stays.
0385503954|3.0|It seems likely that the author has learned of the novelist's craft from reading works such as L. P. Hartley's THE GO-BETWEEN.  Aside from a few trivialities -- confusion about when to use &quot;might&quot; rather than &quot;may,&quot; the anachronism of having a child punch the air in satisfaction (kids didn't do that before the Eighties or so) -- the author seems to have written an assured story in the mainstream of the modern British novel and that will please many readers.<br />But the title &quot;atonement&quot; must be understood with characteristic ironic modern quotation marks around it.  What readers learn to be the &quot;atoning&quot; action of the book, is not an atonement in the historical sense of this word -- a word with venerable and profound religious meanings that, I suppose, the author and many of his readers are too much people of their time to believe could be true.  So the pleasant sadness with a tinge of irony that the author presumably intended may itself provoke a deeper sadness in readers who regret that such an &quot;atonement&quot; as the book presents is the only kind of atonement really believed, by moderns, to be available.  <br />And so the book is truly clever, but it's not great art.  Many people will consume it with excitement, it will make the rounds of the reading groups, but few people will reread it.
B00005OWIU|5.0|You'd think there would be a limit at the amount of catchy tunes there could be!
B00003CX5P|2.0|I personally don't like this movie. I like the old Star Wars much better. There are better special effects than these new ones. This movie should be setting the standards for graphics like the old ones did when they first came out. Again its my personal opinion.
B00005JKCF|5.0|Just getting a chance to watch this movie on its second-opening day made me feel lucky and special!  I'm not kidding.  The tickets for all the shows on Friday, Saturday and Sunday were sold out.  Our local cineplex even had it playing in 3 theaters.  I bought the tickets from a guy whose friend wasn't coming.  Once seated in the theater, I prepared myself to be amazed.  And amazed I was.<br />The special effects are just incredible.  The colors of the costumes and sets are so vibrant you think you're living in the comics book.  The scene on Times Square was particularly inspiring.<br />This movie isn't just an action flick though.  There's most definitely a love story in it as well between Mary Jane (MJ) and Peter Parker.  I think casting Tobey Maguire for the lead role was a perfect choice.  His subtle actions and gestures can convey humor at one moment and inner turmoil the next.<br />So what's this film really about if you take away all the fantasy aspects out of it?  It's about being picked on in high school.  It's about having a crush on a girl who doesn't even know you exist.  It's about finding out something you're good at and alienating yourself from the world.  It's about the fickleness of the public; the manipulative powers of the press.  It's about choices.  It's about betrayal.  It's about revenge.  It's about love.  It's about protecting the ones that you love.  All that packed into a 2-hour motion picture.  Can you believe it?<br />I highly recommend this film for children and adults alike.  Trust me, you're going to want to see this!<br />LEAP rating (each out of 5):<BR>============================<BR>L (Language) - 3.5 (this is a lighthearted film with scenes that make you go \\"awww!\\")<BR>E (Erotica) - 2 (you've probably seen the trailer by now with Kirsten Dunst in her wet dress)<BR>A (Action) - 4.5 (the fight scenes looked brutal)<BR>P (Plot) - 3 (comic book ending, but leaves you wanting to see more)
B00005JKCF|5.0|\\"Good things come to all that wait\\" works like a charm here.  One has to applaud the folks from Marvel for waiting until the right time to make this movie.  In their cash-strapped years, it had to be a huge temptation to accept any kind of money for the rights to their characters.  Had they went with a movie before the technology was ready, any effort would have been a big disappointment.  Had they not held out for a reasonable degree of integrity when it comes to the comic book origins it would have been a disaster.  But for once everybody did just about everything right, and the results are smashingly good.<br />Most important, the plot sticks faithfully (and lovingly) to the now forty-year-old storyline.  We get the teen-aged orphan, raised by an aunt and uncle, getting bit by a special spider that transfers it's powers to the boy.  The boy at first uses his new-found powers frivolously, but is quickly sobered up big-time to the responsibilities he has somewhat inherited.  With few exceptions, the movie goes to great lengths to keep millions of fans happy.<br />There were only a few big breaks from the storyline, and I have no problem with them.  The books had him bitten by a radioactive spider, the movie has a genetically altered spider.  Big deal.  A bigger, more important difference is the fact that the movie Spiderman's body produces it's own webbing, while the book has him shooting web cartridges that he invented himself.  I like the new way much better, as it stretches credibility to think that the teenager could all of a sudden invent this miracle product, AND need to store hundreds of cartridges around the city as replacements.  <br />Casting is as perfect as can be.  I had thought a younger Tom Cruise would be a great Peter Parker, but Toby Maguire now owns the role, showing the shyness and vulnerability of the character perfectly.  I had thought Kirsten Dunst not voluptuous enough to be Mary Jane, but just getting her wet removed all doubts.  The portrayals of J. Jonah Jameson, Uncle Ben, Aunt May, and Harry Osborne are also done well.  <br />Special effects are the only place I have problems.  The biggest is this stupid plastic mask worn by villian Green Goblin.  It just looks dumb, and they should have somehow animated it.  Also, some of the action sequences go too fast to drink in.  But when you can see the magic, yes, it does look like he can crawl up walls and swing between buildings.  When he fights a group of criminals, the body language of his Spider-moves takes the care to show something beyond just human gymnastics.<br />The movie does have something for everyone, and I hope everyone sees it to insure a string of Spiderman movies.  Very young children will like when the costumed folk are on screen, but get a little restless during adult dialog.  However, those generally not into comic books much (i.e., females), can follow the romantic line between Peter and Mary Jane, and for that matter, Spiderman and Mary Jane.  Tobey Maguire, just like Peter Parker, has lucked out big time with some pretty hot screen kisses. <br /> Of course, there are also those millions of fans, some that have waited almost forty years for this to happen, to finally get their due.  To these, of which I'm included, this movie's for you.
B00005OM4N|5.0|Britney Spears' newest album, Britney, is by far her most entertaining and catchy album yet! I would definitely have to say that it was one of the best albums of 2001. It has the catchy songs that make you want to get up and dance, such as \\"I'm A Slave 4 U\\". This album covers more genres than her previous two, with songs such as \\"Anticipating\\", and the classic cover of \\"I Love Rock n' Roll\\". Britney is definitely a talented young lady who is going to be around for a long time.
0671027344|5.0|I highly recommend this book to anyone who is into the whole romance scene. I thought this book had a strong sentimental value to it. I often can compare the main character, Charley to myself. He is very sensitive and very emotional to all that is going on around him. The way the character speaks in his journal entries to an unknown person is a beautiful way to express himself about his experiences with love. drugs. sex. and relationships. i recommend you all to read it. it will leave you with a new way of looking at life and you'll realize there is a Charley in all of us.

B00003CX8J|5.0|After Kate &amp; Leopold &amp; Swordfish (Hugh Jackman films)&amp; Halle Berry's Oscar, I wanted to revisit the X-Men DVD.  What a treat!  I saw the theatrical release and watched this on VCR, but the DVD format is super.  The interviews with director Singer on the Rose show really tell us what he was doing with the film; and he did deliver.  The cartoon comic characters are there with enough action and pacing to keep the kids' interest, but there is also the depth of levels with themes of racism and intolerance to pique the adult viewer's interest and make this a movie ABOUT SOMETHING more than just the cartoon.  The actors turn in fine performances.  I enjoyed the extra material in the DVD version.  We had fun watching part of it in French.  The Fox commentary with Bruce Davison's Senate campaign commercials and the mock news format was a fun addition to the film.  The actors' interviews are illuminating.  I enjoyed seeing what the actress who plays Mystique (the blue woman) looked like.  In retrospect, I really enjoyed the control Halee Berry shows with the character of Storm.  This is a DVD that adds to the viewing enjoyment of the film.  If you've seen this in other formats, you'll want to catch this one.  Storm shines!
B000000WFF|5.0|A bit more low key than their previous release, Spice, Spiceworld, which is also the album complimenting their movie, Spiceworld, is still great. Packed with just a bit more Girl Power, this album produced such hits as \\"Spice Up Your Life\\" and \\"Too Much\\". Viva Forever, released shortly after Geri's departure with the group, is definitely a must hear. It is truly a beautiful ballad, with great vocals and a bit of Latin mixed in. Although not as girly and outspoken as Spice, this album is still a great one.
B00005YW4H|1.0|I purchased this CD based on reviews that Norah Jones was the next great up and coming female jazz singer, who sang beyond her years.  I was in for a huge disappointment!  Most of the songs sound like soft country tunes, rather than jazz reditions.  Her voice is breathy (trying to sound like Diana Krall), but weak.  Most of the arrangements are average at best.  If you are looking for a jazz singer try Diana Krall first, then Jane Monheith or Tierney Sutton.  Norah needs to go back to school, brush up on technique, and try again.

B00000272N|5.0|When FACELIFT was released, the metal scene had started to become stale. Everywhere you looked, hair bands where the dominating scene so when this rocking, sometimes dark and dreary album was released, music become good again. This album is full of classic songs that to this day continue to get a good amount of airplay on various radio stations.  WE DIE YOUNG, MAN IN THE BOX, SEA OF SORROW, BLEED THE FREAK, LOVE HATE LOVE, I CANT REMEMBER, IT AINT LIKE THAT are some heavy songs that rock and suck the listener right in. When I came back from the Gulf War in '91, MAN IN THE BOX was a huge hit, being played all over the radio and MTV. Remember this album was released before NEVERMIND and TEN the success of this album helped to pave the way for the future success of Nirvana and Pearl Jam. I have always thought that AIC blew those two bands away with only SOUNDGARDEN coming close to them. I highly recommend this album to serious hard rock fans. AIC is more metal than grunge and this album shows the future promise this band had and prepared us for the future great albums they made. RIP Layne. Every track rocks

We are in their service to help them grow rich. <br />We have at or disposal the some of the same tools. We just have to spend more time planning and educating ourselves. STOP sitting in front of the television watching sports and soaps. Start putting that effort into increasing your financial knowledge.

0380973650|4.0|Shadow is released from prison early after receiving some sad news.  On his way home from prison, he is followed by a man whom he can't seem to shake.  When this man, who refers to himself as \\"Wednesday\\", begins to appears uncannily at all places that Shadow travels, Shadow's interest in him him becomes more acute to the point that he finally agrees to take a job with him. Shadow is not entirely certain of what his job entails, though.<br />This story walks a delicate line between reality and fantasy, incorporating characters who may, at first glance, seem normal but are not.  In addition, there are many dreams that Shadow experiences that also make it hard to distinguish between fact and fiction in his life.  Shadow, however, is a likeable fellow and one with whom the reader sympathizes and wishes well.  It is for this reason that this novel succeeds so well.  For every difficulty that Shadow faces, the reader is left hoping he'll make it through his bizarre experiences unharmed.

(actually there was no planning.)<BR>2. you don't attack a prison with 2 choppers and 10 men.<BR>3. you don't attack another country by falsifying a signature<BR>if you want to see a good action spy movie - try &quot;the little drummer girl&quot; based on the book by John Le Carre.

B00005JKL8|5.0|If you are an action fiend, you will want to add this movie to your collection.  Behind Enemy Lines is just average military thriller movie starring Owen Wilson, Gene Hackman and a pretty good ensemble cast.  The story of the movie is pretty simple.  Owen Wilson is a Navy pilot/navigator assigned on the aircraft carrier U.S.S Carl Vinson captained by Gene Hackman.  The carrier is deployed to support the NATO effort in the Bosnia conflict.  During a recon mission, Owen and his pilot stray into the DMZ and discover the Bosnian Serbs covering up a mass grave.  After being discovered, the Serbs deploy Surface to Air missiles and shoot down the F-18.<br />When the F-18 flies over the Bosnian, they fire up several SAM's to shoot down the plane.  What follows next is some of the best action film sequences I have even seen.  The F-18 is being pursued by 2 SAM's that eventually end up getting the plane which requires the pilot and navigator to eject and land in enemy territory.  While on the ground, the movie gets interesting as Owen Wilson is pursed by rebel Serbian forces and a trained killer as he tries to make to one of the safe zones for extraction.<br />In one of the lighter parts of this movie, Owen Wilson is rescued by a bunch of Croat Muslims as he is being chased by the Serb sniper.  One of the guys is an Elvis impersonator while the other young guy in the back is an Ice Cube fan.  As he's sitting in the back of the pickup truck, this young Croat is admiring his 9mm sidearm.  Turns out this guy is big fan of hip-hop and rap and start rapping.  It's pretty funny, but I guess you just have to see it.<br />Everything eventually ends well and the rescue team does come and get him making this a fun joyful ride.  The special effects are great and you must watch this movie with your volume cranked up.  This is a great movie to show off your receivers and speakers.
B000056NX5|5.0|I really enjoyed this musical.  &quot;Everything's all right&quot; is my favorite song.  What I really love about Andrew Lloyd Webber's musicals is that the music is very catchy.  It's impossible not to sing along and anticipate the rhymes.  Even the next day I could sing a few lines of most of the songs.  I think this is a CD you can watch several times without getting bored, the music is that good.<br />If you like this one I think you'll like Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat as well (I like Joseph even more).
B00005JKCF|4.0|Ok, virtually everyone on the planet couldn't wait to see Spiderman (the sales from the weekend shows:$114million!!).  The graphics were tight, the Green Goblin was just like he was in the cartoons (outside of the lifeless Goblin mask he wore in the movie), but otherwise, excellent fight scenes and special effects.  there were only 2 complaints i had with this movie: 1-Why didn't the classic Spiderman song play at all in the movie???:-( and 2.  some of the storytelling pauses in between the fight scenes were a little too long (my son started shifting around in his chair and so did other kids) but otherwise, it was a great movie and a recommended must-see!!
B00005JKCF|4.0|I had feared that Tobey McGuire would not perform well in this role after his lackluster narration for the game. Thankfully he pulled of Peter Parker brilliantly. I was amazed as to how well casted this movie actually turned out. The movie seems a bit on the long side, but this is actually a good thing. I've been complaining that movies of late have been relatively short. Its not as long as Fellowship of the Ring, but it is longer than X-Men, and that gives us more time for character development, and while I would have liked to have seen Mary Jane and Harry Osbourne focused on a little more over all the characters were all fleshed out nicely. This is a very emotional film, and I appreciate Raimi's focus on Spider-Man as the tragic hero. This is what Spider-Man is, and that is the critical point that I think that some critics were missing. Spider-Man fights to keep a positive swing (pun intended) on things. He is very much surrounded by constant negativity, and villains deliberately try to go after his friends and family just because he's Spider-Man! The problem with being Spider-Man, for Peter, is just being Spider-Man. This has been the focus of the comic book for years, and while the argument over organic web-shooters, versus mechanical web-shooters can go on for ages it works well with the film. Everything about this film is brilliantly done, well thought out, and at time so well done it is frightening (William DaFoe as the Green Goblin, arguing with William DaFoe as Norman Osbourne.) In this film you see Spider-Man try so hard to write the wrongs of the world around him, only to end up getting hurt. The tragic hero manages to keep a smile on his face and spout witty remarks just the same. The best part of the movie is how real the characters felt. It's a bloody shame that NOTHING about the CGI animations looked or felt real. With as real as the characters felt, the lackluster videogame looking CGI animations worked against the over all film, and in many instances an easy fix should have been available for the sizable budget this movie had. The problem? Probably that ILM has all of its good people out on Star Wars and Lord of the Rings and probably wasn't available to do the CGI sequences. The sad fact is that only ILM can do CGI sequences and have them look good. Every movie without ILM's best people on board has terrible effects. Which is why, were I shooting it I would have done the special effects in a very different way. It is hard, but not impossible to get a human to move that way. All you'd need to do is digitally speed him up. Also, in the first act of the film there is a scene where Peter Parker is chasing after the car jacker who killed his uncle and the entire scene is painfully CGI, and taking McGuire's real face and grafting it to the CGI body would have drastically improved the scene. When Star Wars and other movies offer stunning CGI visuals, and even Nintendo's remake of Resident Evil has such attention to detail right down to loose threads in the clothing there is no excuse for such bad CGI. The effects are the only thing that keeps me from giving this a perfect score, because this could have otherwise been the best comic to film adaptation of them all. This movie is a five star film in a three star package, and that's what holds it back. The worst part is that just a few minor alterations would have made a world of difference. I hope that they do touch up the CGI for the DVD. If not then lets hope that the sequel will have better effects.s an easy fix should have been available for the sizable budget this movie had.

B000005RT8|4.0|After reading everyone else's reviews, I was gettin' kind of scared....I guess everyone has different tastes! I remember hearing this for the first time on Eight Track in the early 80's, and after searching for 15 odd years I finally was able to find the album. &quot;Temporary Secretary&quot; is odd, but fun. Waterfalls, I will agree, sounds like TLC completely lifted the lyrics from Sir Paul (hey, didn't George Harrison get sued for something like this?? Geez...)Favorites are &quot;Secret Friend,&quot; the classic &quot;Coming Up&quot; and &quot;One of these Days.&quot; I automatically skip over &quot;Check My Machine.&quot; No thanks, Paul.<br />But otherwise, not a bad little album.
B000002BUY|5.0|I am not a long term Incubus fan. My first song of their's was Stellar, my first album was Morning View. After spending time around other Incubus fans, I learned that there was so much more to Incubus than Morning View and their poppy single \\"Drive\\". I bought S.C.I.E.N.C.E. (Incubus's album before Make Yourself) and fell in love!<br />For those of you who are new to Incubus... I'm sure you've heard their single \\"Drive\\" on the radio. They started off as a metal band (described by some as metal/funk/rap) and are constantly changing their style. Incubus is one of the few rock bands with a DJ. Their lead singer Brandon Boyd has a beautiful unique singing style (which I have heard being compared to Rob Thomas's style of singing) and their guitarist Mike E. (I won't even try to spell his last name) is creative beyond imagination. <br />SCIENCE is definitely more hardcore than Make Yourself and Morning View, so fans who are scared away by songs such as \\"When It Comes\\" and \\"Make Yourself\\" and prefer LFO to Hoobastank are strongly encouraged not to buy this album.<br />Telling you about each individual track is fun, but will not help you in deciding to buy this CD, but I will tell you that it's fun, heavy, and pure. Incubus's lyrics are as heavy as the guitar chords, and the music itself is complex. For those of the faint heart, there is a bit of swearing, but more for effect and emotion than to just catch your attention.<br />Any fan of Incubus or heavy rock shoul buy this album!!!

0792839129|4.0|This movie may be old, but it is still a classic. I bought it for my five-year old son, and he intently watched it while recuperating from the flu.  The songs are catchy, and the story is captivating.  Should be a part of any child's movie collection.
B000007MVM|5.0|I have just one simple point to make so I'll make it.<br />This is not Pink Floyd! If you are expecting this to sound like \\"Dark Side\\" then there is a good chance you will be disappointed (example: Theron Kousek's review December 21, 2001). If you're the type of person who doesn't stray away from FM radio classic rock then you might want to spend your money on something else. Please understand that I am not putting down Post-Piper Floyd fans or anyone else, I just think a lot of people criticize Barrett's music for not sounding like popular Floyd (it's like getting mad at an apple tree for not growing oranges).<br />If however you are a collector of a broad range of 60's 70's music then Barrett's work is a must have. It's simply great!
6300216802|1.0|This film has no conflict whatsoever, excepting a few mean looks exchanged between Decker and Captain Kirk over who's in command over their ship.  No jokes are made throughout the movie at all.  A paper thin plot goes along with a rousing score and tons of shots of spaceships SLOWLY floating around.  There were so many unnecessary, boring, and stupid scenes in the movie that it could have been squashed into a 51 minute episode EASILY.  &quot;Veeger&quot; is a MYSTERIOUS UNKNOWN OBJECT HEADED STRAIGHT FOR EARTH!  In all actuality, Veeger is just a bunch of BAD special effects.  Going into &quot;warp speed&quot; looks as thouhgh it was ANIMATED (and it probably was).  I was on the edge of my seat ONCE during a particularly good scene.  Namely, the ending.  That's why there is one star, its for the ending.  It was so amazing, after sitting through the whole boring and uneventful film, to think that it had an ending.

158234082X|5.0|I admire Anthony Bourdain. Because I consider myself such a dilettante in so much of what I do, I have a lot of respect for people who are absolutely focused, to the point of monomania, on achieving greatness in what they do. Working in a Bourdain-run kitchen would be easy: all you have to do is be invariably punctual, absolutely reliable, committed to the same high standards he is ... and then work yourself to death to achieve them.<br />Bourdain's story is entertaining, fast-paced, profane, funny, iconoclastic (at least if you like celebrity TV chefs), revealing, occasionally nauseating, deeply personal ... and probably a lot more fun to read about than to have lived through. You won't look at restaurant food the same way again. Sure, you may be more suspicious about what it is you're really being served. But more importantly (to Bourdain anyway, I suspect), you'll have greater understanding and respect for the people who prepared it. The seamy underside of the restaurant world is the most headline-grabbing part of the book, but the real value comes from the author's own experiences, his revelation of the life of an NYC chef, and his obvious love of great food prepared well.<br />At the same time, though, it seemed to me like there's a little bit of bait-and-switch to it. Bourdain spends the whole book talking about the manic, hard-rock, drug-driven, frenetic, foul-mouthed, take-no-prisoners world of the professional chef, laying it all on the line for us: this is what it's really like. And then, in one chapter, he pulls the rug out from under himself with his profile of Scott Bryan, another New York chef who, Bourdain admits, is night-and-day different from our author, and also more knowledgeable, more respected, and more successful. It's to his immense credit that Bourdain is absolutely up front with us about why Bryan is a three-star chef and he isn't.<br />I plan to read Bourdain's other non-fiction work and his two novels. This soul-baring book has put Anthony Bourdain on my list of authors I definitely plan to keep an eye on.y Bourdain on my list of authors I definitely plan to keep an eye on.
B00005JKCF|5.0|Spiderman is a great movie!!!  Not only are the special effects breathtaking, the storyline is true to form.  Stan Lee was an Exec.

It's for  big kids and little ones too!!!
B00005JKED|3.0|This movie has many flaws.  Mainly one being a very outrageous coincidence that could have been it's own movie.  Stylistically it is a send up of cop buddy movies and a shameless rip off of better films (example Taxi Driver).  The same ground was better explored in the English film \\"Sexy Beast\\".  However Denzel Washington saves this film from crumpling into outrageousness.<br />Denzel's Alonzo was good cop who is now using very corrupt methods to control the streets.  His career is very close to going to the next level of greatness.  However his inherent violence has cornered him into a no win situation.  He needs an heir to his kingdom and also a patsy to cover his mistake.<br />He finds both in Hawke's naive but ambitious Jake.  The Jake character comes close to parody but Hawke keeps it grounded.  Jake is a little too suburban for the undercover job.  I found it a little hard to believe that Alonzo would get into the car with him.  But Hawke and Washington keep it believable.  It was nice to watch the interplay between Jake and Alonzo.  Alonzo is at turns beguiled, angered, contemptuous and touched by Jake.  He both enjoys and regrets his torture of his young protege.  The stakes are upped when he witnesses Jake roll two drug addicts in an alley.  You can see Alonzo excited by Jake's violence and immediately wants to own him.  The rest of the movie is a seduction.  Alonzo offering to be mentor and father figure to an impressionable Jake.<br />Denzel Washington gives a very good performance and deserving of notice.  However he has been in such wonderful roles prior to this project.  I find it rather disturbing that the Academy would award him the oscar for a gangster cop rather than his other roles.<br />Another disturbing element about this film is it's real life locations.  I found it very reckless that the director would subject his cast and crew to potentially dangerous situations.  I admire the goal of authenticity but this was unacceptable.  It hurts the film by making it rather voyeuristic.  It also exploits the peril that these people experience every day by turning it into popcorn entertainment.  It harks back to the slum patrol parties rich people used to take part in back in the 1800's.<br />See this film for Denzel's and Ethan's performance.  But the film in general could have been better.
6305372411|1.0|The 1st seven parts of a 12-part series are pretty good - but the 8th part undercuts the value of whole series as far as I'm concerned. The 8th part, which dealt with the aborted and near-disasterous Apollo 13 mission, should have been a story of the triumph of magnificent behind-the-scenes technological solutions to incredibly difficult problems. However, the Apollo 13 story was instead inexplicably turned into a 3rd rate soap opera highlighting 2nd rate journalism. For that huge mistake in producer judgement alone - my recommendation is to not buy the series.
B00005JKCF|5.0|The potential that director Sam Raimi showed with his mainstream hit Darkman comes to fruition in Spiderman (that Raimi throws in several visual/plot homages to Darkman adds icing to a delicious cinematic feast).  Wonderfully the movie never looses sit of it human characters and the action does not overwhelm the story, but serves it.  No movie is perfect and decriers, mockers, and comic book haters will gladly carve into this megahit with relish, pointing out its shortcomings (and there are a few).  But for me it is one of the very best super hero movies made.  A must see.
B000002KOY|5.0|This is a truly BOSS album. The track 'Downtown' alone is worth the purchase. But it also features Nils Lofgren, a Neil Young tune 'Dance, Dance, Dance', Ry Cooder and Jack Nitzche.<br />It's very well put together and all of the songs are super. Some have actually been covered.A live version of 'Downtown' is on Neil Young's 'Tonight's the Night' album. Heck, even Rod Stewart covered 'I don't want to talk about it'.<br />But neither cover matches up to the originals on this album. And it doesn't matter if you're a Neil Young fan are not. Once you like good rock, you'll find this album taking up residence on that tape loop of your favourite songs inside your head.<br />Truly an overlooked, underrated gem of a recording. Hopefully this review will help bring this album the attention it deserves. Buy it.
B00005JKCF|5.0|This movie was simply perfect from start to finish. I seems like you're only in the theatre for half an hour because it is so entertaining that time flies by so fast! People were so pleased with the movie that they actually applauded at the end. I can't remember the last time a movie that was hyped this much actually surpassed the hype, but Spiderman certainly does just that.
B00005JKCF|4.0|...It's easy not to envy director Sam Raimi (\\"Evil Dead,\\" \\"A Simple Plan\\") at the moment. Countless millions of people across the world are laying eyes upon his version of \\"Spider-Man,\\" starring one of the most loved superheroes of all time. The anticipation approaches that of a new \\"Star Wars\\" movie. <br />No matter what critics say, fans of the comic book are going to love the movie. But the fact is, it's only so-so. There are plenty of things to like about \\"Spider-Man,\\" and just as many that prevent it from achieving greatness. <br />The story is set up swiftly and efficiently. New York City high school student Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) is a nerdy science buff living with his aunt and uncle. He has a crush on his lovely neighbor, Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst), and all the kids at school pick on him. Peter's only friend is the filthy rich Harry Osborn (James Franco), son of Norman Osborn (Willem Dafoe). <br />While on a class field trip to Columbia University, Peter is bitten on the hand by a genetically altered spider that has escaped from its cage. Slowly, he begins to change. First he goes from scrawny to muscular overnight, and then he can climb walls, release webbing from his wrist and leap tall buildings. <br />It's at an amateur wrestling event that Peter becomes Spider-Man. He is trying to win $3,000 so he can buy a convertible and impress Mary Jane. When he tells the ring announcer that he is \\"The Human Spider,\\" the announcer (Raimi vet Bruce Campbell) scoffs at the name and dubs him \\"Spider-Man.\\" <br />Soon, Spider-Man is rescuing people throughout the city. He saves babies from burning buildings; he saves storekeepers from being mugged; he helps the police chase bad guys; and he saves the life of Mary Jane twice. Some think he's a hero, other's believe him to be a menace. <br />But Spider-Man has a nemesis. The Green Goblin, aka Norman Osborn, is the result of a scientific experiment gone wrong. He flies around on a \\"glider\\" that resembles a futuristic surfboard. He wants Spider-Man to join forces with him (do they ever want anything else?) so they can rule the world. But Spider-Man only fights for the good guys. <br />The filmmakers have put forth a lot of effort here. The action sequences are elaborate and ambitious. It's exciting to watch Spider-Man fly around New York City saving lives and doing battle with the Green Goblin. Save for a few instances of unconvincing computer generated images, the special effects are outstanding. <br />Unfortunately, there are too many weaknesses. First and foremost, the Green Goblin is a terrible villain. He's comical, not menacing. His cackle is silly, his costume bland. A great villain is a must for this type of movie, and the Green Goblin doesn't cut it. <br />The writing is also poor -- particularly in scenes involving Spider-Man and the Green Goblin (bad one-liners, lame threats) and Peter and Mary Jane (corny and sappy) -- and the pacing is off. Where as the superior \\"X-Men\\" comes in at a brisk 100 minutes, \\"Spider-Man\\" runs almost half an hour longer and drags as it crawls to a finish. <br />\\"Spider-Man\\" is much too amiable and harmless to be considered a bad movie, but it has no staying power. It's almost instantly forgettable and doesn't warrant more than one viewing. And that has to be looked at as a letdown.

B00005JKCF|3.0|\\"Spider-Man\\" is the imaginary friend of generations of kids and adults, who grew up reading the various comic books bearing his name, watching the numerous television cartoon permutations, and wondering when the friendly neighboorhood webslinger would get his shot on the big screen.<br />Well, thanks to Sam Raimi and Columbia Pictures, Spidey finally gets his chance.  A large budget served the production well.  Every aspect of Spider-Man's familiar legacy along with the quirks and costumes of his friends and enemies are on-screen in A-quality detail.  This is a welcome change for those of us who had to suffer through the no-frills \\"Spider-Man\\" TV movies of the late '70's.  The production value is enhanced by a spot-on cast of Tobey Maguire as Peter Parker, Kirsten Dunst as the love interest Mary Jane Watson, J.K. Simmons doing a perfect J. Jonah Jamison, and the marvelous Willem Dafoe as Norman Osbourne (aka the Green Goblin).  Utilizing both cast and production to optimal effect is Sam Raimi, a confessed comic-book fanboy and accomplished director noted for his visual flair.  All these elements are blended successfully on the screen.<br />Where \\"Spider-Man\\" fails, ultimately, is in the story.  The appeal of Peter Parker is that, unlike Superman born into his power or Bruce Wayne traumatized into his calling, Peter is the true everyman who finds himself in a position to help people.  That part is executed well-enough, as Peter learns the lessons of life from his Uncle Ben (\\"With great power comes great responsibility\\"), but does not realize it until he learns the hard way - just like the rest of us.  However, after his initial shock into action, Peter spends the rest of the film doing everything right and escaping the consequences of hard choices that define those who possess power and those we call \\"heroes\\".  <br />In a number of specific instances, including one scene on a bridge taken from one of the most memorable sequences in comic book history, the movie copsout on the hard lessons of heroism that defined and endeared Spider-Man as a cultural icon for these generations past.  The tone of the movie, that of a determined yet remorseful Spider-Man, clashes with that of the story itself - where Spider-Man wins out with nary a consequence to be suffered.  Because the imagery and story does not match the attempted tones and themes, the end of the film rings false.  While a well-done film, \\"Spider-Man\\" does not equal the efforts of the two previous major superhero films \\"Superman\\" or \\"Batman\\".  \\"Spider-Man\\" is a good film, but in invoking its comic book roots and not staying true to them, that which made the character special was lost and ultimately the film is only a shadow of what it might have been.
B000002HPV|5.0|Homogenic is a truly original album, comprised of three essential ingredients:  songs based on lush string quartets; electronic beats and musical motifs;  and the most unique musical instrument, Bjork's voice.  <BR>Written in the midst of her breakup with Goldie, Homogenic was a form of catharsis for Bjork.  The opening song &quot;Hunter&quot;, in a rare 4 minutes and 12 seconds, captures that feeling of invincibility when one says, &quot;I don't need you, I'm doing fine without your love&quot; before breaking down into tears.  The following song, &quot;Joga&quot;, dedicated to her best friend and homeland, contains a coda which has to be the most beautiful two minutes of music I have ever heard, of Bjork crying out for her friend's help in a &quot;state of emergency&quot;.  &quot;Bachelorette&quot; sets a mood similar to &quot;Hunter&quot; with a tragedy/comedy feel.  The Latin piano rhythm stands out as beautifully bizarre.  The rest of Homogenic then takes you on a trip through the raw emotions of a breakup, climaxing with the explosive &quot;Pluto&quot; and resolving with &quot;All Is Full of Love&quot;, the latter which features a pulsating, otherworldly string section on which you can seemingly float up to heaven.<BR>Though I favour the first half over the second, the whole album is flawless.  It is one of the classic releases of our lifetimes and anyone who likes eclectic, thoughtful, meaningful and just plain original music must hear this album.
0930289234|5.0|Long before \\"Kingdom Come\\" meditated on a world without heroes, around the same time as Frank Miller's \\"Dark Knight\\" returned, and executed more forcefully than the \\"X-Men\\"'s story of Sentinels and Mutant Registration Acts, Alan Moore & company asked \\"Who watches the Watchmen?\\"<br />Set in a world where heroes and vigilante justice have run their course, and the last era of superheroes are living out their days quietly with their own ghosts, \\"Watchmen\\" is an amazing piece of literature and comic book artistry.  The series itself, twelve issues now commonly packaged in one booklet, is sprung from the golden age of graphic novels - the 1980's, where graphic novels told stories and presented images where normal comics, movies, and televison shows feared to tread.  Perhaps most importantly, the themes of the story ring as true today as they did then, and the emotionally-invested reader will perhaps see themselves in the everyday characters talking sports and entertainment as the newspaper headlines blare klaxons of war and pending doom.  Society entrusts its safety to a greater body politic, but who watches the watchmen and what is the price paid for handing over the responsibilities of self-defense and indulging in a comfortable apathy?<br />These are the driving themes behind \\"Watchmen\\", a graphic novel so stunningly well-written and well-drawn that I do not hesitate to recommend it to even the most ardant skeptics who look upon comics with disdain, never thinking to read anything remotely associated with them. \\"Watchmen\\" represents the perfect synergy between the use of pictures, the potency of the written word, and the sublime power of symolism that drives artists wielding either brush or pen to record their art permanently on canvas or paper.  A worthy investment that stands tall amongst the great literary works of the latter part of the 20th century.
B00003CY0V|1.0|The only thing I can say about this movie is that it was bad.  A bad plot, bad dialogue and Travolta's copyrighted bad acting. I watched this movie because of Hugh Jackman, and he was truly the only part of the movie worth watching.  Several times he seemed to be marveling at the horrendous movie he found himself in.  I only gave this movie one star because there was no half-star rating.  Hugh Jackman fans, avoid this movie and watch him in The X-Men, Someone Like You, or Kate and Leopold.
B00004Z459|4.0|Well personally I thought the CD was pretty good. I mean it wasn't a whole lot of the typical music you usually here. I mean I like rock music, but it has a lot of rapping which isn't the greatest. It has awesome beats though. Whenever I am angry the songs help me deal with my feelings and they give those songs where they relate to your feelings. Overall the CD is definitely a must have for your collection.
B00005JKCF|4.0|Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) is somewhat of your typical high-school nerd.  He is a borderline genius who can't handle a simple conversation with the girl next door who he has loved for years, Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst).  He works on the school paper, has coke-bottle thick glasses, and is spindly at best.  No wonder he is the point of all cruel jokes.  One day when the school is touring a science lab they go through an exhibit where scientists are trying to genetically mutate spiders combine all the individual powerful attributes of spiders into one \\"super-spider.\\"  Unfortunately they don't know that one is missing.  Parker finds it as it bites him on the hand.  The rest of the day is a blur as he feels himself getting more and more sick.  When he returns to his Aunt and Uncle's house that night he passes out and has strange dreams involving the spider.<BR>     The next day things are different.  Peter finds he doesn't need his glasses and he appears to have gone from scrawny to having the body of a gymnist as he slept.  Stranger things are beginning to happen as his hands stick to things and a weird web-like substance is coming out of his wrist.  After he defeates the school bully in a joke of a fight he finds himself running in panic into an alley.  When he remembers the bite on his hand he begins to have an idea and, being the scientist that he hopes to be, he tries an experiment.  Before he knows it he is crawling up the side of a building and jumping the roof tops.  He is even learning how to shoot the webs from his wrist.<BR>    Like most teen-agers who suddenly have power he decides that with a lot of money would come the girl of his dreams.  Parker enters a professional wrestling ring for an exhibition bout dressed as \\"The Amazing Spider-Man\\" and promptly destroys the giant of a man.  Unfortunately things begin going to his head and he lets a robber get away from him with devestating consequences.  Suddenly he learns to his horror that, \\"With Great Power, Comes Great Responsibility.\\"  Parker uses a newly designed costume as well as increased skill with his powers to help the citizens of New York.<BR>     Unfortunately Parker is not your average super-hero.  He isn't rich and doesn't have a trust fund so while battling crime on the side, he also has to find a place to live, get a job, see about getting into college, take care of his Aunt, and oh yeah...dare we forget that with the rise of a super-hero and villain is bound to appear?  <BR>     Norman Osborn (Willem Dafoe) is the father of Parker's best friend.  He is rich, a brilliant inventor, and after ingesting a super-soldier type formula, quite insane.  Osborn dons the exo-skelton he had been designed for the military as well as stealing a glider and is quickly dubbed The Green Goblin by the press.  As we all know, the two will eventually battle.  The real question is how Parker is going to handle battling a villain who he frequently hangs out with for dinner when Norman drops by to see his son, Harry.<BR>     This was really well-worth the wait.  Fans of the comic will really not have too many complaints.  Sure they have changed some things for simple continuity but nothing great has been changed.  People who haven't read the comic will also be able to follow this introductory story (since there will most certaintly be a sequel).<BR>     Sam Raimi directs this with much of the style that he has done similar features previously with the Evil Dead series.  This has many dark tones but is also infused with the humor that helps move the story along.  There were a few slow moments but overall nothing that would cause the fans to lose interest.  The special effects are worth every penny that has been paid.  Certainly many things do look computer generated but it is done in such as style as to closely mimic the drawings that would appear in the comic.<BR>     Casting was always a major worry in this movie.  Many people, such as myself, were worried to hear that Tobey Maguire had been cast.  Sure he had done a wonderful job in The Cider-House Rules and certainly he had held his own in the idiotic Wonder Boys, but casting him as Spider-Man???  Well, I have to apologize to Mr. Maguire because he certainly did a wonderful job hear.  He definitly was able to handle the dramatic moments and also carried more than a certain sly charm that allowed him to do the trade-mark quips that fans of Spider-Man have come to expect.  He also has spent an incredible amount of time with the personal trainers and that showed.  I for one will willingly back him for the sequels and hope that we don't have a fiasco similar to Batman with the actor changing each film.<BR>     Willem Dafoe is probably \\"the weakest link\\" in the movie and that is more from the writing of his character than how he does.  I think that at times they made his acting a tad too comic-bookish if you will but that really wouldn't be his fault.<BR>     I approached this movie with a certain amount of trepidation and yet enthusiastically.  Spider-Man is a comic-book hero that many can identify with since he seems to have the most human problems of them all.  Thankfully the writers and direction of the movie all worked exceptionally well.
B00005RFAI|5.0|This is a very good C.D.!! I recommend that you listen to it. My favorite song &quot;Get the Party Started&quot;.
B000008COG|4.0|BLOW UP YOUR VIDE teamed once again with producers George Young (brother of Malcolm and Angus) and Harry Vanda, in the hope of getting that \\"old feeling\\" again, since prior albuns FLY ON THE WALL and FLICK OF THE SWITCH were really beyond expectations.<BR>And the final result was quite surprising. This album is really strong, containing some of the strongest compositions by AC/DC ina long time.<BR>The album, however, is handicapped by some serious flaws, which impends it from getting 5 stars:<br />1 - The absolutely obnoxious lyrics. Lyrics were never a strong point in AC/DC, but in Bon Scott days at least they had a lot of charm and humor. As for the Brian Johnson´s years, the lyrics of BLOW UP YOUR VIDEO reached an all-time low quality.<br />2 - Cliff Williams´s bass seems to have been almost entirely forgotten in the final mix!!! You just can´t listen to it! (sure, know it´s there, but it´s very, very low)
B00005QZ7U|4.0|This is a DVD that really worth your money. Get the special edition that includes the Tango dancing sequence. That's the best dance sequence you can find in the market. Feel the power.
6305013578|1.0|This film is great, its a masterpiece, a classic, words cannot begin to describe both the importance of this film.<br />This DVD, however, is horrid,, featuring a grainy picture, that at times looks like the film was stored, unprotected, in someones garage for 70 years, and music that seems to have nothing to do with the film.<br />If you can't find any other version and really have to own a copy, then this may just be inexpensive enough for you to overlook the failings. Personally, I recommend the Kino version, which is now unfortunately out-of-print, and would never recommend the tinted 80's version as the soundtrack is just too distracting.<br />One final thing: No matter what anyone else says, this version is NOT tinted. Only one tinted version exists, and this is not it.
B00005BJ2O|5.0|You thought all the movie soundtracks are boring. This one certainly will shock you. <BR>Le Tango de Roxanne is the best piece within the whole album, it makes you just want to get up and dance. Feel the jealousy, feel the love struggle, and feel the helpless of lovesick. Sting can't sing any better, consider he just released a jazz version of Roxanne in his &quot;All this time&quot;. Still, Le Tango de Roxanne really sells.<BR>Indeed, this is an excellent CD, and you should also get the DVD set to see the Tango sequence.
051788710X|2.0|As an avid dreamer and explorer of dreams I find myself compelled to read as much as possible on a topic that I find so interesting.  I am a dreamer, not on a path searching for my soul; in fact I'm not quite sure what that means.  Robert Moss has taken his belief system, a religion to many, and forced it upon the reader.  True, I am a skeptic.  I don't necessarily believe, as Moss claims in this book, that I can meet my waking friends in the same dream in the same dreamworld, or that I will be visited by dead relatives &quot;contacting&quot; me in my dreams.<br />I also find his interpretation of specific dreams to be extremely far fetched.  ANYONE can relate their dreams to their waking lives if they dig deep enough.  So just because I have a few dreams about train stations I will not automatically assume that I need some more &quot;train&quot;ing in certain areas of my life.<br />However, this book offers great insight into shamanism that I found to be very interesting.  I am not a believer, but I am certainly not a disbeliever.  Anything is possible, but perhaps I was not quite ready for Moss' very spiritual way of thinking.  If you are in to that sort of thing, you will enjoy the book.  I bought the book expecting something else.  If you want to learn more about becoming conscious in your dreams to benefit your waking life, I would stick to good old &quot;Exploring the World of Lucid Dreaming&quot; by Stephen LaBerge.
B00005A3KS|5.0|Even though i dont like the \\"sissy boys\\" Reeves and Swayze, in this movie they are my idols cool surfing lifestyle and thrilling action kicks....<BR>This and Roadhouse is the tops of Swayzes movies...!!
B00005Q45W|5.0|I have never heard anything so amazing in my life. Leonard Cohen is the king of music and poetry.  Anyone who likes him will die with this album. It's music for the soul. Should it be available by prescription only? He is more amazing with age! I can't believe anyone would rate it anything less that a 5 !
6304698798|5.0|This film is essential for those who conceive cinema as a visual art. Sergio Leone produced on of the best final scene ever made in cinema history. Buy it forever!
B00004YX39|5.0|I just started listening to Steely Dan in the past six months and this happens to be one of my favorite albums.  Aja was the best in my opinion but this one is very good as well.  It seems that their style just went from rock to more of a jazzy state as the group progressed.  The only problem I have with album is it's very short.  More songs would have helped, but the ones they have are great.
B00005AAFS|5.0|This is straight up a great album! the music is both heavy and melodious. I don't speak German, but I got the translations off the net. The entire CD is Excellent. If you are a fan of rock, metal,or even techno...Get this CD!!!
B000002U82|5.0|I'd have to say that this album is the most thought-provoking piece of music that I've ever listened to. With the smooth electronics and the warping stereo surround sound, with headphones on it almost gives you the feeling of being far, far away, like on the dark side of the moon. *rimshot*<br />My favorite song is &quot;Great Gig in the Sky&quot; because of the various aspects of it, however most of these are in most of the songs. The quiet beginning, the loud, warping stereo surround middle, and then the serene ending gives a sense of being far away, as does the rest of the album. However, it is rather strange at the end of the song that if you listen closely you will hear the last note being tuned sharp and then back to normal.<br />It is rather interesting to watch &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot; while listening to this album, because the music and lyrics combine with the movie and connect to different aspects of it. Pink Floyd must've watched the movie at least 100 times to get it right even when you have to play it 2.5 times. They deny ever doing it, though. (To see this, start the album at the third roar of the MGM lion at the beginning of the movie. If you have it right, the music will first change when producer Marvin LeRoy's name appears.)<br />If I had to describe it in one word, it would be genious.
B00005MP58|5.0|This is the most perfect adaptation of a novel I have seen and a wonderful movie. The characters from the novel come to life, just as Jane Austen wrote them. I greatly admire Jane Austen's novels--she is a really terrific writer and Pride & Prejudice is tied with Emma for my favorite. Trying to read a modern-day romance novel after reading Jane Austen is impossible, as the writing and characterizations are so horrid in comparison. The Austen movies I had seen previously, such as Emma (with Gwyneth Paltrow), are good but due to their shortness, can't totally follow the book. This movie faithfully displays almost every scene in the book and uses a lot of dialog directly from the book. That makes it really delightful because Jane Austen wrote such witty dialogue. And it means that the movie has the same high quality as the novel. There are a few scenes added that are not in the book but they are a minor part of the movie. The scenery is lush and gorgeous--makes one want to travel to England. The DVD makes the colors look wonderful in the scenery. The casting was great. Colin Firth is wonderful as Darcy--brooding, haughty and incredibly sexy. I saw him first in Bridget Jone's Diary (which was inspired by this) and that made me want to see this. Jennifer Ehle as Elizabeth is also very good, though occasionally it's hard to tell her emotions. For instance, she doesn't look astonished by Darcy's proposal, which is how she is described in the book. But otherwise she is excellent--she conveys the wit, strength and sweetness of Elizabeth. Mr. Collins is just as disgusting, obsequious and funny as in the book.
0440539811|4.0|Don't read this if you seek simplicity and cling to boredom.  This incredibly complex series is entertaining and funny (if long-winded).  It serves well as a science fiction, fantasy or as a spy thriller.  The twists are profound.  Keep in mind that there is a sarcasm which pervades the books.  If you are looking for a serious read, this may not be for you.  If you are looking for something thought-provoking, fun, and entertaining, then give it a try.<BR>Best Wishes--

B000002I25|5.0|&quot;the doors&quot; is, without a doubt, the greatest album in rock history. there are no lyrics like jim morrison's in the history of pop culture, nor is it likely there ever will be.  even in a time when its all been said and done, when nothing really shocks anyone anymore, jim morrison still seems unusually subversive. morrison isn't just talking about adolescent rebellion or having a few more beers than are good for you: he's talking about actively submitting to the forces of madness and chaos that lie at the root of the unconscious. he was, is, and always will be a model for artists who choose the dark side. this is surrealism, philosophy, and a statement about human life on a pop rock album. &quot;end of the night&quot;, &quot;break on through&quot;, and &quot;the end&quot; are the most important songs on the album if you want to hear morrison's poetic voice come through loud and clear.<br />the best band headed by the most fascinating, important figure in rock.
0767817664|2.0|I love horror movies. I love black Comady, but \\"Fight Night\\" had very annoying character's in it. Their's a big difference between funny and annyoing, but not the case of \\"Fright Night\\". The Vampire in \\"Fright Night\\" is [bad] when he trys to be funny and very laughable when he trys be scary. I am suprised on how much of a hit \\"Fight Night\\" actully became.I still suggest you rent this before you buy.
0440224764|2.0|Anybody who claims to not have forseen the final events of this novel must be in denial. On the plus side, the torture sequences were disturbingly well written. Made me uncomfortable, it was quite real. Overall, though, a pretty poor, predicatable, formulaic effort.
0385484518|5.0|This is such a great book to read. Morrie indeed taught me many things. This book motivated me to live life to the fullest. This book makes us think about how our lives really are. And the thing we do that we think will make us happy. This book made me think how we take everyone and everything for granted. For example, our lives are always busy and we never get a chance to show any appriciation towards people we love.
B00005JKCF|5.0|This movie is a great way to escape reality for a couple hours.  It is entertaining, interesting and funny--as well as touching-- to see how Spiderman evolves and develops once Peter gets bit by the spider.  The acting was really good, and you get action and special effects that are worked into a well developed story line.  Plus, that upside down kiss was even better than in the preview!  This whole movie lives up to those fantastic previews, in fact.  Note to parents, there is one very violent scene which is so realistic that younger children will probably be disturbed by it.  I would highly recommend for teens and older though!

B00005JKCF|5.0|This movie is, without a doubt, the best adaptation of a comic book that I have ever seen. Tobey Maguire is Sensational as Peter Parker, portraying him as the outcast teenager undergoing some Spectacular changes.<br />Dafoe portrays businessman Norman Osborn and his diabolical alter-ego, the Green Goblin, with undeniable skill and makes Spidey's deadliest foe oh-so-frighteningly believable.<br />Kirstin Dunst is outstanding as Mary-Jane Watson, Peter Parker's long time love interest. She shows a wide range of emotion in this film, from joy, elation, and happiness to fear, grief, anguish, and sorrow.<br />The rest of the cast accurately portray their roles, from irrascible publisher and noted nemisis of Spider-Man, J. Jonah Jameson, to Norman Osborn's unappreciated and troubled son, Harry, to Peter's beloved Aunt May, the comic that entertained me since I was five years old comes to life in a way I'd only dreamed about.<br />The special effects are well done, too. From Spider-Man's wall-crawling ability to his trademark webs, and the mid-air battles with the Green Goblin, you can almost feel what it's like to swing through Manhattan.<br />Some aspects of the book were changed for the movie. Spider-Man's web-shooters are no longer mechanical, but a biological aspect of his new powers, and the Goblin's costume is somewhat altered, among many other things. But these details are to make the movie flow more smoothly, and only readers of the comic will notice them anyway.
B000063K62|5.0|This is a brilliant and highly original animated film, directed by Richard Linklater. It is definitely not a children's movie, not because it contains \\"adult\\" themes, but because it is very verbal and intellectual. It is actually a series of discussions on philosophical topics. The unifying theme is dreaming. The protaganist is a young man who cannot seem to wake from his dream. As he encounters many eccentrics, who expound on existentialism, evolution and rebellion (real life conspiracy theorist Alex Jones is the voice of a rabble rouser), he gradually realizes he is having a long lucid dream (a lucid dream being a dream where you know you are dreaming). Can he ever wake up? Are dreams and waking really separate worlds? The highly creative and original animation provides a superb visual counterpart to the film's intellectualism, which would be a little dry if it was just people talking to each other. In this manner the film satisfies both sides of the brain. The voices are entertaining and diverse; among them are Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy, who starred in Before Sunrise, another Linklater film. Waking Life is not for everybody; it doesn't have a linear plot, action or sex. It does, however, raise some very interesting questions about life, civilization and consciousness. It is probably the best conversation-centered film since My Dinner With Andre.
B00005JKCF|5.0|Wow! I can't even describe it!  This movie had you rolling in your chairs laughing and on the edge of your seat in suspense!  Toby played an excellent Peter! Couldn't have asked for a better guy.  Defoe was absolutely amazing! The Goblin freaked me out! What a stunning performance! The only drawback was the immobile mask on Goblin's costume. All in all, YOU MUST SEE THIS MOVIE!!
0553573403|4.0|Martin's book is a brilliant combination of old ideas, new ideas, pulp and literature.  Overall this equates to a great read, which the reader can enjoy immersing himself in.<br />Martin does a wonderful job developing the implications of a world where the seasons last for an indeterminate amount of time (is. some number of years) without beating it over the reader's head.  I really enjoyed the concept that very young adults would have no memory of winter and the difficulties that are associated with it.  It reminded me a bit of those who graduated during the years our economy was flourishing and had no concept of what it was like to find work in a recession - until recently.  No doubt, those older than me have much better comparisons.<br />It is the subtle development of such ideas that contribute a great deal to elevate the book above standard pulp fantasy.  Other examples of well developed ideas are the mysterious and fearsome direwolves kept by the Stark family; the idea (and implications) that some characters follow gods which are more \\"ancient\\" than the gods followed by other charters; the well placed references to the historic races of man which inhabit the world; and the slow revelation of the history of the world.<br />One reviewer complains that the characters are uninteresting because they are archetypal.  While I have to agree that many characters were archetypal, I found many of them to be so likeable or interesting that I did not care.  For example, the fat King who enjoys overindulging in food and women.  Stereotype -yes, but also more than enough extra character development to make him a very interesting and likeable character.<br />Having said all of that, I do believe that some of characters were a little one dimensional (i.e. Viserys, Lysa, Joffrey) and that the book might have benefited from editing out some of the details associated with them - and also some other scenes.<br />I also have a major problem with a decision that Catelyn makes, which is pivotal to the story.  Granted she had very little time to commit to a course of action, however frankly I found it hard to believe that she was stupid enough to be tricked as she was.  I thought this quite inconsistent with her character.  I suspect it was done in an attempt to be true to life - everyone does stupid things that are out of character occasionally - however to me it appeared to be a huge flaw in the story.<br />Final complaint - the language is occasionally a bit melodramatic.  Otherwise, the prose was excellent so this is a very minor point.  It is easy to be a critic.<br />The bottom line is that this a great accomplishment and I am excited about starting the second installment.hich is pivotal to the story.

B000056K04|3.0|The album &quot;Everyday&quot; is a decent, but does not live up to what I expected from Dave. It has a more popish sound and sounds like it was made for the radio. This album is very different from the old Dave and it isn't as good. The older songs from albums such as &quot;Before These Crowded Streets&quot; and &quot;Crash&quot; are Dave's better works. &quot;Everyday&quot; strays from the uniqueness of earlier Dave albums by the absence of  Boyd Tinsley (Violinist) and LeRoi Moore (Sax). Even though &quot;Everday&quot; is a good album, it just doesn't match up to the older Dave.
B00005NGSD|5.0|There are so many great Scorpions albums, Fly To The Rainbow, In Trance, Lovedrive, and Love At First Sting just to scratch the surface.  This outstanding album, mysteriously unavailable on cd for years just might be the cream of the crop.  Kicking off with Steamrock Fever, this disc contains some real rocking gems. I've Got To Be Free, The Riot Of Your Time, and The Sails Of Charon. Even these epics pale to the Scorpions masterpiece of their earlier days, the haunting, driving, We'll Burn The Sky.  I can't say enough about this disc.  BUY IT!!!!!!!!!!  Also this band is touring this summer here in the states and I've got my tickets!!!
B00005QDW1|4.0|I understand some people don't like this new CD because its so different from what they've produced before and they've strayed so far away from their ska roots.  Sure, its not exactly &quot;rock n' roll,&quot; but then, No Doubt was never really &quot;rock n' roll&quot; to begin with.  The reason why I started listening was because I loved their eclectic sound and how they used so many different styles of music and combine them into their songs.  That's what they've been doing with each and every album.  Each album has such a distinctive sound that it almost sounds like a different band each time.  No Doubt's first CD was a very fresh, original CD while the Beacon Street Collection (if you like ska, this is the album to buy) is their classic.  Tragic Kingdom is my favorite because the music is so peppy and upbeat.  I love the energy pouring from that album.  Return of Saturn is very dark...a very different tone than Tragic Kingdom.  And as for this new one...I think its definitely returned to the peppy, happy atmosphere.  But this time, No Doubt has added a more sophisticated edge to their sound.  They know that they can't go back to their ska roots because they've grown past it.  They're still partying and having a good time, but as adults now.  I think that as artists, its great that they're growing and stretching past their boundaries.  Sure, they definitely don't sound like the ska band they used to be.  But they don't put out albums that recycle the same kind of music like every other ska band out there.  That's why I love No Doubt and will always love No Doubt.  They stay true to themselves as artists and that's the kind of quality any real musician will possess.
B00005OWEG|5.0|The film is not about \\"somebody's madness\\", nor is it about Viet Nam. It's about spirit, energy, and emotion. Perhaps those concepts are too vague for it's less agile viewers. Redux is a must have for any Apocolypse Now fan.<br />This is a story that's been told since probably before language. It's a long movie. Yet it flies past as I watch every single detail. From the largest explosions ever in a movie, to the Ride of the Valkeries, Death From Above, it's pure power and fury in parts.<br />Still the film maintains a sort of gritty realism never captured in any other war movie. The sweat rolling of the Captain's head, or the Giant trees in the lush forests of Cambodia add a bit of flesh and earth to the movie.<br />You get right up close and personal with the characters as you're whisked through heaven and hell on the way to who knows what. It all makes sense in the end if you paid good attention to the overall scope of the story.<br />Obviously this movie is either loved or hated by it's beholders. You'll just have to experience it for yourself to decide which side of that coin you are. Just be sure you watch it more than once. It is readable like a book. No two people reading a book come away with the exact same grasp of it either. Redux, where have you been all these years?
B00005JKL8|1.0|It was terrible. I suppose if you knew nothing about the military or escape & evasion or survival techniques, you might find it exciting. However, if you have been exposed to the previously listed concepts, you will find the movie a waste of time.<br />I hate movies that make the military look like idiots and that is what this movie does. The main character exercises the worst judgement and is an embarrassment. Virtually everthing he does is contrary to survival principles.<br />On the positive side, it was patriotic. Gene Hackman was, as always, a good actor.
B00005OAIE|5.0|In the time dominated by boy bands and a talentless (nameless) flake, John Mayer's &quot;Room for Sqaures&quot; is a reminder of what music can be. His lyrics which surpass his age are raw and powerful. Perfect for a young adult looking for music which will speak to them on countless levels. After one weekend of listening I have adopted this album as a soundtrack to my life.
B000060MWU|1.0|What a great shame this beguiling movie has been given a dreaded &quot;pan and scan&quot; release. The widescreen format is especially important to convey the unique sense of tension only David Lynch can achieve- through directing,lighting and set design. I'm afraid I didn't even bother to watch the dvd for this reason and intend to return it as I regard Lost Highway as Lynch's best, most satisfyingly bizzare film to date.
079213690X|5.0|Great movie, easily in the category of the cast-of-thousands greats from thirty or forty years ago.  Was William Wallace really a bigger hero than Robert the Bruce?  Beats me, I wasn't there and neither were any of Wallace's (or Mel's) current gaggle of detractors.  One thing is clear, the Bruce's historians were more practiced, better connected and doubtless, higher-born.  All of which makes it all the more remarkable that we know anything about William Wallace at all.<br />Mel Gibson's acting is superb.  And the scenery is breathtaking.  Sure there are some flights of fancy here and there, in part because Wallace's legend was passed down by itinerate entertainers for many years, rather than being diligently recorded by court chroniclers like the highborn or royalty - who of course had their own story to tell.  Oh, well...  Brave Heart probably fits closer to the historical novel category, than a pure old documentary.  Documentaries often seem compelled to leave out much of what cannot be proven, unless it serves some contemporary expediency.  Thankfully Brave Heart doesn't fall prey to this pedagogical frailty and is entertaining from start to finish - I suspect that's what Mr. Gibson had in mind all along.  And he told a wonderful story in the process.<br />Yes, I wish it ended differently; Yes, I was angry at the betrayal, Yes I rejoiced in the victories; Yes it's probably a little too graphic for the tie-dyed crowd and yes, I've watched it several times.  Great, great flick, well deserving of all its accolades.
B000003CM9|5.0|this album is so awesome because it has probably the best instrumental rock song in history, In Memory Of Elizabeth Reed takes you on a journey thats so inspiring that you can't even begin to imagine how great musicians this guys were. Dickey Betts guitar is incredible not to mention the sounds that came from the late great duane allman is out of this world,this song or intrumental piece has a lot to offer it even has a mini drum solo! believe me if you havent heard this song before try it you wont regret it. As for the other songs, like said before midnight rider is cool and revival ain't bad either listen to it and you'll discover how beautiful this album is, great southern rock!
B00005OWIU|5.0|\\"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone\\" is a story all about magic, so it's obvious that the film needed a truly magical underore, and not everyone can deliver a magical score. Chris Columbus had worked with John Williams before on the first two \\"Home Alone\\" movies. and I think he made the right choice when asking him to score the first \\"Harry Potter\\" title. <br />This score is...amazing?  Wonderful?  Awe-inspiring?  Take your pick of words, but none of them fit this stunning piece of work performed beautifully by the London Symphoney Orchastra.  Magical is the only word for it.<br />It succeeds in many areas where the movie it was created for fails. Williams has created a score that is perfectly tuned to the changing moods of the book and movie. At times warm and inviting, while later eerie, dark, and forbidding; at times happy, at other times sad, and sometimes all out thrilling. The strong diversity of this score is most perfectly reflected in the beautiful meadly \\"Harry's Wonderous World.\\" track two (and my favorite track) on the CD.<br />Furthermore, the strong use of motifs enhances the score and film, and the eerie Harry Potter theme is destined to earn its place among John Williams' most famous works, right up there next to the Star Wars Main Title Theme and the Flying Theme from E.T. This score is clearly the best of its year, and the MPAA is [bad] not to hae awarded it the Oscar for Best Score. It is in my mind. My only complaint about this release is that it is an abridgement, and hope that someday the complete score will be issued.<br />Of John William's score for \\"The Phantom Menace,\\" George Lucas said \\"Every fan of Star Wars -- and of great music -- is in his [John Williams] debt.\\" Changing \\"Star Wars\\" in the quote to Harry Potter, the same applies here. This is a wonderful score, and it is truly magical -- one of the most magical of all time --and should not be missed for all the gold in Gringotts!<br />This is a truly five-star score in every way, shape, and form.  ***** ...

B000002HRE|1.0|That's what i've been saying since i first heard \\"load\\"(one of the worst albums ever). It appears that since the black album metallica just continues to go downhill further and further. It seems metallica has truely turned their back on metal in favor of following this \\"Nu Metal,\\" grunge-influenced garbage. They seem to have gone the route of Slayer and opted for an immature, \\"street smart\\" style of music. Next thing you know they'll be collaborating with Ja Rule.....oh wait...they already have. I guess this is the end of the so-called \\"kings of thrash\\" oh wait...the end came years ago (remember the \\"black album\\"). Metallica needs to retire. What they have become is simply pathetic. \\"the memory remains,\\" the memory of the great band they once were that is. Metallica has gone so far as to say \\"we're not sellouts.\\" But take a look at what kind of people buy their new music. The Limp Bizkit and Linkin Park crowd. This album was so horrible that i gave it to my friends little sister and let her draw on it. Well, i believe it's safe to say: METALLICA, ALONG WITH KORN, IS KILLING METAL!!!!!!!
B00005YW4H|5.0|This is one of those CD's that you put on either first thing in the morning with your fresh cup of coffee while the sun shines through your windows or late at night with your camomille tea as the rain dances on your rooftop.  It's peaceful, refreshing, and uplifting all at once.  You want to tap your feet and sing out of tune.  In a world currently full of Lou Pearlmans who are behind commercialized, bubble-gum, processed-cheese music it is wonderful to finally have someone with talent squeeze through.  With artists like Norah Jones, Tori Amos, Imogen Heap, Leonard Cohen, music stays true to what it should be... heavenly and inspiring and real.  I'm happy!
B00003CXZ4|5.0|My favorite movies are those that leave me asking myself more questions than I am ready to answer.  Dealing with man suffering from the rare Korsokov's syndrome (a memory disorder where one cannot form new memories), this murder thriller explores how fragile the definition of \\"self\\" & our being totally human really is. I saw this when it first came out.  Blew me away.  Bought it on tape when it became available.  If you like Hitchcock & movies that make you think,buy it,don't rent it. (I hardly ever by a movie-but I had to have this).  The editor got robbed at the Academy Awards.  I have never even thought anything about editing ... but the editor here was an absolute genius.  I believe I read in a magazine that is was the only movie from the Sundance festival in 2001 that made any money to speak of (I think it grossed $24 million).  Not at all bad for an Indy flick.  But this IS NOT an \\"art\\" flick.  If you are not on the edge of your seat then: a) you have already died, b) your idea of fun is summer re-runs, c) you are Sister Clarice who taught me in the first grade or, d) a possible \\"a\\" & \\"c\\" combined.
1577311523|2.0|AS a long time student of meditation practice, I found Tolle' book too often offering overgeneralizations that don't fit. His section on couples and relationships is so idealistic as to be unrealistic. He makes many excellent points, but misses others. I do not doubt his experience(s), but his explanations leave one wanting too often. For what it purports to be, I was disappointed in this book. Too often , \\"self enlightened\\" teachers misinterpret their very real experiences and mislead the eager reader or student. Pema Chodron is a better source for those seeking to learn of self realization and it's implications in every day life.
B00003CX5P|5.0|If you are a Star Wars fan this is DVD is a must.  Episode I may not have lived up to the hype for some people, but you have to remember that the hype for Episode I was huge.  A great fun adventure movie, but an incredible DVD.  The special features DVD is worth purchasing alone.  Lucas really gives you a treat with the deleted scences.  The making of the film is also really worth watching more than once.
B000002HMH|4.0|Let me make a few things clear. I do not watch MTV, I do not listen to the radio, and I love all of Metallica's albums from Kill 'em All to Justice. Don't waste time reading the heaps of one-star reviews by narrow-minded individuals who can't tolerate any change.<br />While most of the tracks off Load are merely average, there are four worth considering even by die-hard old-school Metallica fans: Until It Sleeps, Hero of the Day, Bleeding Me and The Outlaw Torn. Until It Sleeps sounds a lot like the bridge of the song Master of Puppets. Hero of the Day is written more like Metallica's old stuff, but much less heavy. However, this doesn't stop it from being excellent. Bleeding Me is a lot like Fixxxer, the best song off Reload. Finally, The Outlaw Torn is an absolutely mind-blowing song that is leagues ahead of even the godly Master of Puppets and Ride The Lightning. (And yes, it is heavy! w00t!) If you only listen to pre-Black Album Metallica, you should still listen to The Outlaw Torn. Trust me, if it were on Justice, then that CD would have been hailed as Metallica's best instead of Puppets.
B00003CXD5|5.0|This film is one of the best Bogart films ever.  I have personally seen it at least ten times and know other people who have seen it even more times. Truly a classic. Walter Houston is a gem and Robert Blake(lately of muderous fame )plays a small role as the kid who sells Bogie his winning lottery ticket.I hope it comes out soon on DVD. Badges...We don't need no stinking badges...We need this film on DVD
B000002HRE|5.0|What an amazing CD. Easily just as good as the legendary Master of Puppets or Ride the Lightning.<br />1. Fuel - While most die-hard Metallica fans say this is the only song off the CD that they like, it's actually one of my least favorites. The bridge is the best part, but it's just too short. To be honest, I often skip this one.<br />2. The Memory Remains - OK, OK, so this song is purely alternative, and Marianne Faithfull's voice is easily the most annoying thing you'll ever hear on a Metallica album. Fortunately, they managed to make this song into something amazing on S&M. I usually skip this one, too, but the best is yet to come.<br />3. Devil's Dance - Wow! It's just as heavy and frightening as anything off Puppets or Justice, yet rarely is mentioned by old-school Metallica fans. Hmmm...<br />4. The Unforgiven II - Miles ahead of its lackluster predecessor. OK, the first one isn't so bad, but I can't believe people go around calling the sequel inferior! It's so much better that it's astounding! It could be because I heard the sequel first, but I don't care. I love it.<br />5. Better Than You - Another mediocre track, which is pretty much filler. I often skip this one. You might be wondering why I gave the CD 5 stars when there's three weak songs on it. Keep reading.<br />6. Slither - So what if the riff is just Enter Sandman backwards? Slither blows away the absurdly overplayed Sandman! This is the song could have made Metallica famous.<br />7. Carpe Diem Baby - I hated this one at first, but it quickly came to grow on me. It's a slow, but fun rock song that gets stuck in your head easily.<br />8. Bad Seed - Another possible radio hit that, if released instead of Enter Sandman, could have made Metallica just as famous as they are now. Have you noticed that I'm sick of Enter Sandman?<br />9. Where the Wild Things Are - Incredible. Now we get into the very best of Reload, with what is definitely the most messed up, frightening song Metallica has ever graced uswith. From the shockingly scary intro to the mind-numbing dual voices of the bridge, and while this song might never get played on the radio or at Metallica's shows, it shows us that they're still capable of writing music just as scary as One or anything else off Justice.<br />10. Prince Charming - Amazing! This heavy hard rock tune with two, count 'em, TWO furious solos, an incredibly infectious riff just as fast as Blackened or Fight Fire With Fire, and catchy lyrics, (Yes, catchy lyrics!) this is one of the greatest Metallica songs of all time!<br />11. Low Man's Lyric - Metallica gets a lot of [heat] over this, but I don't care. The hurdy-gurdy and entirely unheavy guitars sound like they would ruin Metallica forever, but somehow they manage to make an incredibly emotional ballad way better than any song off The Black Album! But if you don't like it, I can't blame you.<br />12. Attitude - Another great hard rock tune that would have fit in perfectly with the rebellious music scene of the 80's. It's kind of like Prince Charming, but not quite as good. The next song, however...<br />13. Fixxxer - Holy sweet mother of smeg. I've heard every single one of Metallica's CDs, from Kill 'em All to S&M, and I must say that without a doubt this is the best song Metallica, and perhaps anyone, has ever made. Master of Puppets got me into metal, but I have to say that even that amazing song pales in comparison to this godly work of art. I can't stand listening to songs multiple times in a row, yet once I listened to this 8.5 minute epic 11 times in a row and never got sick of it! I can't describe it without making it sound less than what it is. Even if you hate Metallica's new stuff, listen to this and prepare to be humbled.
B00005JKED|1.0|It's sad that as talented as Denzel is that he won the oscar for this [junk]. He is a terrific actor, but I guess it was a black year, no way was he better than Russell Crowe. He has done many great movies, for which he deserved an oscar, but this was not one of them.
B00005B1W7|5.0|Movie versions of great books typically fall short of expectations, simply because there is no room in two hours to convey the whole message. In this case, however, the version lasts more than 5 hours, so there was time to adapt this wonderful story faithfully. This is done very well and with good attention to detail. Bear in mind, though, that because it was originally a mini series (and therefore meant to be watched in chapters over the course of several nights), the editing is done in &quot;chapters&quot;, and it does not play like a normal movie. It really doesn't matter, because we get an opportunity to take breaks along the way without interrupting the flow. And breaks you need, because of the 5+-hour length. All in all, this is a faithful adaptation, and an excellent video.
B00005JL9B|5.0|The sole reason I am adding to the list of quite a few adequate reviews is because I don't think that the true tone of this film has been touched on. Yes, many appreciate it for the large amount of violence, however this movie achieves a goal not many films come close to. It breaks through social barriers and creates a question that can't be ignored. I suggest that if you can't see this film due to it not being released in the U.S. read Lord Of The Flies. This is a beautiful piece of cinema if you are willing to experience the violence. Try Ebay if you must see this and live in the U.S.
6304795254|4.0|In \\"The Game\\", Michael Douglas plays Nicholas Van Orton, a successful, filthy rich investment banker who may just be on the edge of death.  Coming from a long line of rich men who couldn't stand their ordered lives - especially Nicky's father who killed himself on his own birthday - Van Orton is determined to survive, even as he lives alone and unloved in a baronial manor outside of San Francisco.  Van Orton spends his days setting high profit goals for the companies he's invested in, even those whose relationship with Van Orton's money go back to Nicky's father.  On the eve of Nicky's 48th birthday (the same age in which Nicky's father gave himself the gift of suicide), his brother Conrad (Sean Penn) pops up with a birthday gift of his own - The Game.  Conrad is a bit of a character - not quite as self-made as Nicky, he buys crystal meth from the waiters who work the restaurants where Nicky dines - but he has Nicky's number.  The Game is a scavenger hunt, a high tech puzzle in which Nicky seems to be the prey.  Characters, places and whole situations appear and disappear.  Kara Unger plays a waitress, a seemingly innocent bystander who gets dragged into the game...or is she part of it.  The Game pushes Van Orton's buttons, and even Conrad seems to realize that they're all in over their head.<br />The Game is a psychological thriller, which means that it's supposed to mess with your head.  The real puzzle however is Van Orton - he starts out dead, but the game brings something in him to life, something you'll appreciate if you're a Michael Douglas fan.  It's also clever, and telegraphs impending thrills - in one scene, Van Orton receives the roll handle for a car door's window, and you can just imagine the spills in which that trinket will come in handy.  If the flick has any flaw, it's that none of the characters other than Van Orton (and maybe Conrad) become real - like Van Orton, the script is almost afraid of reaching out to characters who may be in on the conspiracy.
B00005JKCF|5.0|As soon as the \\"Spider-Man\\" ended all I could say to my brother who went and saw it with me was \\"That was the best movie I have ever seen.\\" The movie is truly amazing. All the actors were amazing. Tobey Maguire was fantasic as Peter Parker a.k.a Spider-Man and Kirsten Dunst was good as Mary-Jane Watson. I also thought William Defoe was good as The Green Goblin. The movie stayed very true to the comics and everything! If you don't plan on seeing this movie I would have to say something must be wrong with you. <br />This movie is nonstop and keeps you wanting more. I can't wait for the sequel! After I saw \\"Harry Potter\\" last year I thought nothing would ever be able to top it off but \\"Spider-Man\\" proved me wrong. The movie is great and I think everyone should go and see it. I wish I could give it more than 5 stars it was that good. If I could give it as many stars as I want I would have to give it like 15 stars. So if you haven't seen it get up and go you will not regret it!
B000001E3V|5.0|unbeliveable, i can listen to this for hours. best jamming on any live disc ever. clapton steals the show. even without layla and bell bottom blues this is a must have for any rock, blues or guitar fan.
B00005QZ7U|3.0|Moulin Rouge tells the story of penyless writer Christian (Ewan McGregor) who falls for the Moulin Rouge cortisane Satine (Nicole Kidman). But Satine has to be bound to the Duke in order to keep the Moulin rouge an his owner Zidler from bankrupcy. And to complicate things, Satine is slowly dying of an incurable disease.<br />The first 45 minutes of the movie i found myself amazed by the spectacle, the superonic pace, the surealism. It made me forget the bad jokes and the weak story, which has been told a thousand times. So now that my eyes got used to the viusal style of Baz Luhrman they got tired. The movie reched his lowpoint with an awful Madonna cover and became overloaded and annoying.  The songs ween't that great in general but I still liked the idea of an overblown musical. But little would have been more and the theatrical acting and the continuous \\"look what we can do\\" killed this movie from being interesting as a whole.<br />The quality of the DVD is amazing and the special features are interesting and I have great respect for Mr. Luhrmans creativity. I just hope that he won't keep repeating himself and won't be affraid to do something compelling without pomp and glamour. <br />\\"Moulin Rouge\\" was definately worth seeing but couldn't grab my attention from start to finish for its artifficial hipness and lack of depth.
0790729350|4.0|i own this on laserdisc but the dvd in 5.1 dolby digital is far better. classic performances include: santana - soul sacrifice,  joe cocker - with a little help from my friends. my only complaint is not enough of csny, the who, santana and sly and the family stone. and too much boreing footage.
B00005YW4H|4.0|I took a chance with this album, considering that Ive never heard of Norah Jones . And boy, that chance paid off nicely, I must say. Imagine a gentler, softer Macy Gray, with none of that voice pyrotecnics,and you've got Norah Jones.. Her voice is caramelly smooth, and considering she's just all of 22 years old, she sure sings with a lot of confidence and poise... <br />Her choice of songs do need a bit of working on though, at times, they do sound a little similiar ... i think Norah will do much better if she's got a stronger ensemble. <br />Nevertheless, listening to Norah Jones still gives me the goosebumps..if you're far away from you loved one and feeling a little blue inside...check out track #6, \\" shoot the moon\\", it's a sweet little ditty and guaranteed to make u feel better..<br />give her a listen, she's well worth your time !
B00005U122|5.0|I'll make it short and sweet (the previous reviews covered most of it).<br />If you like Pink Floyd/Roger waters (and own a DVD player of course) You must own this DVD!<br />Excelent sound, beautifuly produced.
B00005OMTT|3.0|I have loved Enigma for years and years now, but I wasn't completly happy with this cd, Not that the songs aren't good or anything, but I think it's cause they took there best songs and mixed the actual songs into almost a whole new song.<BR>It's good to own, but It could have been alot better then this.
0385484518|5.0|I loved this book the first time I read it.  When I was diagnosed as a terminaly ill cancer patient I read it again because I needed another dose of Morrie's attitude in my life!  I recommend this book to everyone.  I did learn life's greatest lesson from Morrie.  The lesson I use the most is not to let myself feel sorry and sad for myself.  I'm lucky to be alive!
0790742780|4.0|Some movies stick in your mind. Most don't. This one has stuck in my mind for a long, long time. <BR>For one thing - it changed my view of Michael Douglas - from thinking he was basically an average tv actor riding on his dad's coat tails to seeing him as a major acting talent.<BR>I see where the official Amazon review is coming from, denouncing the stereotypes etc - but...I think we're seeing the world through this character's eyes. Isn't that an achievement? <BR>See it and make up your own mind.
B000021YQV|5.0|I got this album the week it came out, and I half expected it to be a weak production.  No way!  This cd rules, and the only lame track on it is ATWA.  Everything else rules!  Catch these guys live, if you really want a cool show.  They have an amazing stage presence, and you can tell you're looking at something cool.  When I saw them, Shavo tripped and fell, but he kept playing!  Exelent band, exelent cd!
1881273156|5.0|Someone gave us this book as a wedding gift, and it is amazing! I have since given to almost every couple I have known who has gotten married. It looks at the different ways that people express and perceive love (and in a non-gender focused way, which I really appreciated, since I do not often fit gender stereotypes). It basically traces the roots of almost every relationship problem to miscommunicated love. This book has already blessed and enriched (and oftentimes even saved) my marriage many times over. I think that everyone who is married (no matter how long) or is thinking about getting married should read this book with their partner.
B00005JKCF|5.0|GREAT DIRECTOR!!! GREAT CAST!!! GREAT MOVIE!!!<br />As much as I hate to admit it, when I first saw Toby Maguire I didn't think he was good enough to play Peter Parker and Spider-Man, but now that I've seen the movie, I can see I was wrong--he might even be the only actor who could have played the role!!!<BR>But Willem Dafoe nearly steals the movie as archenemy Norman Osborn/Green Goblin!  And Cliff Roberston is excellent in his brief but important role as Uncle Ben--\\"With great power must come great responsibility.\\"--Kirsten Dunst is good as Mary Jane, and J.K. Simmons is fantastic as J.Jonah Jameson!!!<br />    And Sam Raimi proved to me that he's a great director, because only a great director could pull off this movie and make Spider-Man realistic by using terrific mixes of real New York street scenes and excellent special effects!!!  <br />    SPIDER-MAN IS THE BEST COMIC BOOK MOVIE EVER!!!  Or as Stan Lee used to say, EXCELSIOR!!!<br />                                           Chari Krishnan<BR>                                           RESEARCHKING
B000001DTM|4.0|If you don't own a Dake Study Bible then you won't understand half the references in the lyrics on this album. Bono's devotion to the Rev. Finis Dake is overt in almost every song. The only problem is that if you haven't read Dake's study bible you won't be able to see it.<br />Those who have ears to hear will hear!
B000002B7S|4.0|Fresh off of the Diary of a Madman tour,the Ozzman returns to Barnyard Studios to produce an album that is perhaps his greatest achievement as a solo artist.That is for the first and only time in his career he handled the writing chores himself for an entire album and what an album it was.<BR>Upping the Sabbath quotient in the mix aslongst with continuing the experiment started with Randy Rhoads on Blizzard and Diary,Bark at the Moon nicely bookends those two albums making for a nice trilogy of releases.It was a moment of clarity for the artist before the excesses and overly glam influences of the mid eighties that nearly sunk his ship on the Ultimate Sin crept in.<BR>Tracks like the unforgettable title one,You're No Different From Me,Rock and Roll Rebel,find Ozzy addressing fans and critics alike in a pleasing fashion and Jake E. Lee proves he's no slouch either when it comes to guitar either.In my opinion it was amongst the man's finest hours and one I think  Randy would of thoroughly enjoyed.
B000001GQJ|5.0|I completely disagree with anyone who says that Argerich is all flash with no depth.  That could not be any more incorrect.  Every piece on this CD is like a gem.  The Chopin Scherzo is full of bravura and excitement and beautiful phrasing.  The J'eux d'eau is the best one I've found out there and same goes for every other piece.  The sound quality is also superb.  This is a CD you will keep listening to because you simply don't get tired of it and it is filled with emotion.  I highly reccomend this CD.
B000002V0Q|5.0|I have always been a huge Metallica fan and I always heard of Megadeth but didn't think much of 'em. I regret not noticing them earlier because they're an excellent thrash metal group much in the vein of Metallica. My best friend had Megadeth's CD Countdown to Destruction. I borrowed it one day and I was blown away. Every song is a bonecrunching Metal ride. Mustaine's vocals are awsome and fun. After I listened to it, I rushed out to buy it. There is only one thing bad about the album; My favorite song Psychotron as a flaw 1:08 into the song. It's a electronic/static sounding skip. Every CD I have heard of this album has that same flaw. I wish the record company would do somethin about it, but oh well, I guess I can live with it for now. After hearing this album, I plan to buy Megadeth albums in the future.
B00005JL3A|5.0|Being a huge fan of Resident Evil I think this movie was very good. I've got everything from the novels, comics, games and figures. And believe me this movie will be in my collection as well. I think it is really neat to see characters come to life that you have run into while playing the game like the dogs, the licker, zombies and the virus itself. If you are a fan of Resident Evil, it is my personal opinion that you can not go wrong with this movie. you have got to check it, I'm positive you will like it!
B00005K3O4|3.0|Wow!! After reading the exhaustive reviews, I feel inadeqaute. The reviews are much better than the movie. <BR>The movie itself is awful, filled with has-beens and never-weres to act in a terrible script and plot. An alien species, who just happen to resemble clowns, descend to earth to go grocery shopping. Invading a small town (why always a small town? why not New York?)they wrap their food (read humans) into tidy cotton candy cocoons to enjoy later. The heroes, including a rookie cop and a high-school? nerd battle the klowns to save the town. <BR>I guess modern circuses ae a racial memory of previous visits by these aliens which means that we must be tasty.
B00005T30L|5.0|This movie sort of sneaks up on you and grabs hold when you're not looking. Funny, insightful and in the end rather sad, this is one film that stuck with me long after viewing. Certainly not for everyone, but a great piece of film for those looking for a quirky, memorable movie!
B000022TSW|5.0|I can't add to what has been said in reviewing the movie. You just have to see it to believe it.<BR>Having said that, I find this movie to be the epitome of satire, annihilating every \\"sacred cow\\" of American pop culture. Before anyone gets mad, I am a former Marine who loves my country and will kick ... if anyone messes with it. But because I love it, I can see it foibles and want to do something about it. The best way to get Americans to change is to make it humorous and/or laugh at it. <br />From pseudo-moralistic censorship to Disney's monopolistic control of kids to Hollywood hoopla to the computer's ubiquity, this movie laughs at all of it while asking, is it all worth it? <BR>It takes every dogma and carries it to its (il)logical conclusion to show how ridiculous it is.<BR>This movie is the true inheritor of Plautus and Pope's A Modest Proposal. <BR>Not for kids!!!!!
B00005A46T|5.0|...As far as the album is concerned, this is probably one of the top 5 heaviest albums ever released, PERIOD.  From \\"People = Sh*t,\\" to \\"New Abortion,\\" this record just beats you senseless over, and over again until you can't take it anymore.  I saw these guys on their tour last year and the songs sound even better live.  If you're into metal and are looking for something to bang your head to, this is probably an album you should get with no second thought.  You will not be disappointed....
6305537321|5.0|Audrey Hepburn is a large influence on my life (those of you who read reviews under my old sn will know that), and this is possibly her very best film. Breakfast at Tiffany's is the story of a young woman who's lost herself over the years. She lives in an apartment with a cat who has no name and eccentric neighbors calling at all hours. Her name suits the personality: Holly Golightly. She falls in and out of romance, but is a romantic. She's somehow well known yet nobody really knows her. <br />The title of the film comes from Holly's habit of taking her breakfast on the streets of New York and looking in the windows of Tiffany's while she eats (immaculately dressed, of course). <br />When Holly's husband appears- seemingly from nowhere -and declares her a fraud, not the high society woman she masquerades as, you get a feeling for the character. I imagine everyone has a different opinion of Holly, but to me she's inspirational. She's willing to leave behind her old life and remake herself in New York City, to never abandon hope for love and to become someone better, someone with a named cat!<br />Joking aside, it's a beautiful film that I would recommend to anyone. I'll agree with one of the other reviewers that it is not for the younger crowd simply because they wouldn't really understand or appreciate it. This is a film for the more mature who would like something a little different from the \\"new\\" romantic comedies.<br />Everyone does well with their parts, Audrey is perfect in her role and George Peppard carries it very well where Audrey leaves off. It's the essential love story for your DVD collection.
B00005JKCF|5.0|As far as super-hero movies go, they are usually either 'hit or miss.'  Several have done extremely well in the past (ex. Superman, Batman, X-men) while others have failed miserably. Spider-man has been caught in a plethora of legal battles for well over the past decade, which have hindered its ability to come to the big screen.  BUT, it finally got here! And let me tell you, as far as super-hero movies go, they don't get any better than this! But, that's not all...this movie is a great movie in general, regardless of the fact that it is about a super-hero. <BR>The movie manages to tell the story of Spider-man's origin (which could be a movie in itself), while also weaving in a bad guy to the plot. This movie shines in several areas:<BR>This movie couldn't have been cast better. Tobey Maguire perfectly fits the roll of Peter Parker (Spider-man's alter ego), meshing both Parker's typical teen angst and confusion, as well as his nerdiness and the fact that he is a complete social misfit. Kirsten Dunst is gorgeous as the red-headed Mary Jane Watson (the love interest), and purposely tried to make her character less ditsy than she is in the comics. Dafoe is fantastic as the psychotic Green Goblin, and even the Macho Man Randy Savage has a small, but funny role.<BR>This movie also shines in the visual effects.  Spidey's swinging from building to building was mostly computer-generated, but it stil manages to keep some element of realism (to the complete extent that you can in a movie of this type). The flips and the flexibility and sheer grace that Spidey leaps from the buildings exemplifies the physical and athletic change that Peter Parker goes through after he is bitten by the spider. <BR>Finally, the love interest is actually believable!  Most super-hero movies tend to have very corny, rather unnecessary love scenes, but this one is different.  You can actually feel the chemistry between Peter and Mary Jane.  <BR>The costumes are also great, but I won't go on and on about those. Let just say that they certainly managed to do each character justice. Go see for yourself.<BR>So, if you were ever a fan of comic books, see this movie. If you like fun action movies, see this movie. If you want to see some fantastic, roller-coaster sequences through the buildings of New York city, see this movie.  It is great for kids, for adults, and all in between.  This movie will not disappoint!!!
B000002J1Y|5.0|I'm a 15 year old boy. I own =all= Yes albums on cd an most on Vinyl. I do have a record player in my room, and if it were not for the fact that they have car cd players, I  prefer Vinyls over cd's. This is a great album, all the best of Yes, and personally you don't get the raw live energy of an audience through a digitally recorded live album such as Keys. As Chris Squire said \\"It's not the band that makes a live album, but rather the energy of the audience and unless you can fit a crowd in the studio, it won't happen.\\" I write this not so much as to review the album, but to complain to a man from texas that said something to the effect of \\"Music nowadays is followed by people with 3-minute attention spans and like bands for their haido's?!!\\" Give me a freakin' break!! I'm not an anti social nerd, I have spikey hair, I look like a normal modern kid and I love Yes. Also my other favorite band tied for first with Yes is The Beatles with Zeppelin, Pink Floyd, The Stones, and The Doors   following. My point to all you adults is that age has nothing to it! I might be 15, but I side with you adults in saying that kids my age don't know good music from a hole in the wall because all they know is [junk], so I've done my best to turn people on the the classics and I've mad over 10 Beatles fanatics and about 7 Yes heads. Please don't be stereotypical.By the way, I play guitar bass and drums. I can play the fragile album on bass. I can play the following on guitar: Yours is no disgrace, Starship Trooper. Perpetual Change, Roundabout, South Side, Long Distance, Mood for a day, Heart Of The Sunrise, bit of CTTE, And You And I, Siberian Khatru, Turn Of The Century, Wondorous Stories, Release Release Owner and more. Write in a review if you want to be in my band, if you play bass or drums, and youre 15 or 16 :)  You'll read many other of my Beatles and Yes reviews. Peace.
B00005IC2H|1.0|As full of interesting harmonic, melodic, and rhythmic invention as a New England sky is full of color in the middle of a week long drizzle.  There's no sense of musical progression, of modulation, of forward movement, of the development of a musical idea.  Repetitive.  Static.  Of most overly repetitive songs one can at least say that the first few frames of the endlessly replayed musical scene are interesting at first listen.  Not so here.  This ablum is a truly singular anti-achievement.
0060194995|5.0|We've all grown up in worlds we didn't understand; the dos and don'ts us grown-ups define for our children's lives are projected through the innocent eyes of a six-year old girl trying to figure out our world. <br />The book starts with a rough portrayed picture of the American South during the Depression years through the eyes of a child, who though surprisingly intelligent and far beyond her years, is still too young and too innocent to comprehend the world as it is. As we proceed through the pages, the facade drops only to reveal that, what lies beneath is a world of hypocrisy, social lies, prejudice, and ignorance.  <br />A handful of ideas occupy the reader's mind while at reading the book: innocence, education, bravery, prejudice, fear and justice.<br />Education is the weapon through which the widowed father arms his children to fight society. He treats them as equals, adults and of a certain level, thus producing a charming yet troublesome duo...<br />It soon becomes clear why he thinks education is so important. Education is the key to unlocking the ignorance that causes such prejudice.  Lessons regarding bravery and cowardice are also taught in an effective way and in a much wide spectrum than not just children but also adults would think of. Atticus's children find out quite early in their young lives that guns do not make men brave and that any fascination with guns is unfounded. <br />Instead, fighting with one's misfortunes, especially when the battle is by fact lost, is the way of making true men, men of honour. His children learn that it takes more bravery and self-restraint to avoid a fistfight than succumb to the temptation of going through with it. Some adults never do...<br />The most important issue of the book is prejudice in all of its forms.  Through the eyes of Scout, her father is the liberal approach to human relations and her aunt is the respective conservative. Gender roles, class distinctions and skin colour are the facts imposed on thechildren growing up in the average southern town of yesteryears. The belief that a cast of people are better, is confronted by the father's stand, that one should sympathize with others and \\"walk in their skin\\" before judging or criticizing them. <br />Innocence. As hunters kill mockingbirds for sport, people kill innocence, or other people who are innocent, without any remorse about what they are doing.  Killing innocence is like amputating the spirit, projecting to the young hopeful minds of tomorrow that all is vanity, thus killing any hope in their minds and hearts, and wiping out any chances that our society might have to adopt, adapt and improve...<br />Then comes fear.  Small town folks fear that they should adhere to what others think they should do, act within the margins the social rules command, or be isolated. \\" Cursed is the mutant by God and men...\\" Even nowadays, fear of rejection dictates the social status quo and keeps individuals from standing up for that which they believe. Coming from a Greek society, I have been many times confronted by my immediate or wider environment about things I felt, thought or imagined of being right.  I think that the lesson learned here is that until we are able to comprehend and absorb other people's ways, we are just slaves of our own prejudice, fear and hypocrisy...<br />...
0440234743|5.0|This was my first John Grisham novel.  Wow!  I cannot believe what I have been missing! This novel hits home to me.  We live in modern times and this book shows how greed for money can make you do some unbelievable things.  I was hooked from the first page of the book.  We can be so selfish as human beings and this novel shows many examples of that. It is unbelievable that some people put money before family or friends.  I do not want to give away anything about this book.  If you have not ever read a John Grisham novel, you will not be disappointed by choosing this book.
B00005B36H|5.0|Ok,first of all,I'd be the 1st to admit that this album takes some listining to get used to it.On the 1st couple of goes,you wont get past the the 5th song,but gradualy you get to know the songs pretty well.If you know the lyrics,that makes the album twice as enjoyable,if i can use that word.For those people who say its too long an album,and the songs drag,it's probably because you look at the time..big mistake...if you just sit back and let the music take you over,youl find it's the shortest 78 min cd you'l ever listen to...i can easily sit back and listen to the whole album in one sitting now,and it always sounds better than the previous time.I doubt I will say anything new that hasnt been said before,but yes,Maynard is the greatest singer in metal/rock/alternitive music around,ever since aenima,and as for Danny,theres no better drummer around.enough said,just go bye the damn thing and judge it for yourself.
0684833395|4.0|In Joseph Heller's WWII story, Catch 22, we the readers are given a less than perfect picture of the realities of war.  By showing the ironic and irrational events that take place during a war we are able to see why the main character, Yossarian, hates war, and tries his best to stay out of it as much as possible.  Heller is able to produce a comic effect throughout the book by telling of some of the crazy stunts that Yossarian does in his attempt to live forever or die trying as he puts it.  Yossarian fakes ever possible illness he knows, he makes himself and others sick and finally outright refuses to fly any longer. But in the end he must decide if he wants to risk the lives of others, or his own. The mess of other characters also adds to the humor of the work by showing the effects of war on all different types of people.  <BR>   This book was written excellently, and paints a very vivid imagine in my mind.  The only thing slightly difficult about the book was the fact that Heller skipped around throughout the book, never going in order.<BR>   For all those who think war is always the right way to go, don't read this.  But I would recommend this for those who always wondered what it's really like to look death in the face, for this book is able to present it in a comical tone while still keeping it serious.
0971855110|5.0|I have tried my entire life to be the organized person I thought I should be.  Believe me, I have purchased many books before on home organization.  But nothing resonated with me until I discovered FlyLady's 27 Fling Boogie and the power of 15 minutes.  I have been a FlyBaby for about a year and my house has really become a restful, uncluttered place of refuge for our family.  FlyLady is a Godsend!
B00003CXXP|2.0|I wanted so much for this movie to at least be enjoyable, well it didn't even close. If you haven't seen this movie please rent it first and don't waste the $20 buying it.
B00005OAIE|5.0|I heard &quot;No Such Thing&quot; on the radio, and the lyrics automatically brought a smile to my face.  Of course, any song that talks about running &quot;through the halls of my high school&quot; screaming at the top of your lungs would make anyone smile.  This whole cd has the simple effect of provoking wistful emotions and vivid imagery, not only in lyrics, but in the melody itself.  In &quot;Neon&quot;, I can clearly see the &quot;trail of ruby red and diamond white&quot; lights he's describing.<br />This CD is a wonderful mixture of rock, jazz, and words that could make anyone smile, or melt, or just notice.
0812550706|5.0|I wanted to select a science fiction piece for my book club and chose Ender's Game becuase of it average customer rating.  Not only did the entire group enjoy it, but we discussed it for more than 2 hours which is by far a record for us.  <br />I have since then read Speaker for the Dead and Xenocide and am now beginning Children of the Mind.  I highly recommend this book and the others in the series.  Orson Scott Card will keep you glued to the pages and leave you wanting more.
B00005U122|5.0|I really wanted to go to this concert when Roger Waters was touring America a few years back, but the logistics made the trip impossible at the time. Well, here it is in all it's glory. The band is remarkable and the DVD quality played over a really good stereo brings the whole experience to life. Especially powerful were the excerpts from AMUSED TO DEATH and it was great to hear SET THE CONTROLS FOR THE HEART OF THE SUN from the old-old Pink Floyd days. The abreviated version of SHINE ON YOU CRAZY DIAMOND serves as a nice tribute to Sid Barret.<br />Another highlight of this DVD is the behind the scenes video showing the involved process leading up to the staging of this impressive tour.<br />Highly recommended to fans of Pink Floyd and Roger Water's solo career.
B00005JKCF|5.0|As I grew up I was a fan of Super Man and Spider Man comic books, but I never really got into them, but when I heard this movie was coming out I knew I had to see it. This movie portrays the great works of Stan Lee and Steve Ditko who made Spider-Man into an ever-popular comic book while making Marvel Comics famous.<br />A bite by a rare breed of spiders at the Columbia University science lab gives Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) great vision and a perfect body. He also is also given great agility to jump form large skyscrapers and spin webs from his wrist. Then he assumes the identity of Spider Man to fight off the evil Green Goblin (Willem Dafoe),  that terrorizes the city with a glider that drops several bombs at a time.  Spider-Man nearly loses his life while saving the life of his girlfriend, people who are being threatened to be killed by the Green Goblin, and many innocent people who he doesn't even know.<br />Tobey Maguire, with the emotional lead role overcomes the tragic death of his beloved Uncle Ben, growth trauma's, doubts, sorrows, and fear, to save lives and become the city icon. Willem Dafoe's hystericals and split-personality suffered after a lab-experiment gone wrong make him be a friend one minute and the evil Green Goblin the next. Kirsten Dunst fits the role nicely as Peter's love Mary Jane. Even characters with smaller parts like Peter's Uncle Ben (Cliff Robertson), and his friend Harry (James Franco) are amazing. Sam Raimi's big-screen version of the Marvel Comic's good-vs-evil Spider-Man comics is portrayed by outstanding acting, eye-popping special effects, great sound and much more. If you are a Spider-Man comic book fan this is a movie you have to see.
B00005JKCF|5.0|Very well made.  Since I was a geek, I can relate with<BR>many things in this movie.  Great action.  Got to see<BR>the next one!
0385493622|5.0|This is a remarkable and engrossing human story about the search for the proof to the age old Fermat's last theorem. A story which tells the tale of one man's unflinching determination and single minded devotion to the cause of this proof. The events which unfold and the riveting account of Andrew Wiles journey to glory are told in this gripping tale by Simon Singh. Singh's master storytelling abilities are very well exemplified and will be appreciated by one and all. Those not inclined mathematically will also gain insights and concepts of mathematics and also get a peek at the lives of the mathematicians who are featured in this book.<br />Andrew Wiles read about this theorem when he was barely ten year old in a library while flipping through one of E.T. Bell's book. The rest as we know is history because this particular moment became a turning point in young Wiles life. This would force him to take a career in mathematics and lead a rigorous life in mathematics. Later he would be shutting and isolating himself from the outside world so that he could devote his complete attention to the task at hand - to solve this 17th century conjecture devised by the great Pierre Fermat. History saw this theorem remaining unsolved for 350 years, which eluded mathematicians like Euler, Sophie Germain, Lame, Kummer, Cauchy et al. but who nevertheless had their own bit of contribution to the proof in particular and mathematics in general.<br />Andrew Wiles mathematical proof of the century was not without its share of pitfalls. After announcing the proof of Fermat's Last Theorem in June 1993 with much fanfare and publicity, Wiles didn't have the wildest idea about what was in store for him...  something which will almost make him accept defeat...<br />Though Prof. Wiles succeeded in his endeavor, his proof was based on post-Fermat mathematical ideas like the Taniyama-Shimura conjecture, Galois group theory, Iwasawa theory and the Kolyvagin-Flach method. Fermat on the other hand had claimed that he possessed the proof for the theorem which obviously was based on mathematics of his time...<br />A great read. Recommended for one and all.
B00003CY6M|5.0|This charming romantic comedy has all the right ingredients and serves up a bouillabaisse of schmaltzy romance and slapstick fun.  Jonathan (John Cusack) and Sara (Kate Beckinsale) meet in Bloomingdales when they both want to purchase the same pair of gloves.  The attraction is instant and they spend a romantic evening cavorting around New York City together.  At the end of the evening John wants to see her again, but Sara decides that if it is fate that they should be together, they will find each other again.  She drives away in a cab and he never sees her again.   Well, almost never.<br />Years go by and both of them are about to be married, but each still has this nagging feeling that the other was his/her one true love.  Of course fate conspires to bring them back together (after about a dozen near misses) as they each simultaneously undertake one last attempt to find one another just before they get married to someone else.<br />The fate angle is plowed mercilessly, almost to the point of nausea, but the skits are funny and the chemistry between Cusack and Beckinsale is enchanting.  Cusack is an expert at playing the tortured and neurotic lover, but here he is more haunted and forlorn than dysfunctional, and it plays much better than his previous two characters in \\"High Fidelity\\" and \\"America's Sweethearts\\".  <br />Kate Beckinsale rocketed from obscurity to prominence with her performance in \\"Pearl Harbor\\" and proves to be a wonderful romantic lead in this film.  She is breezy and adorable and spins a delightful web around Jonathan and the viewer.  The film also benefits from outstanding comedic support from Jeremy Piven as Jonathan's best friend and devoted Sara sleuth.  Piven's zany comedy proves to be the perfect complement to Cusack's wry despondency.  Eugene Levy is a scream as the eccentric Bloomingdales salesman, who blackmails Jonathan into buying half the store to give him information from Sara's charge account.<br />All in all, this is an entertaining comedy that is insubstantial but delectable.  I tend to give romantic comedies a little more slack, because I'm a sucker for this slush, and this is one of the better ones I've seen in a while so I rated it a 9/10.  This lighthearted romp makes a great date flick, but if serious drama is your preference stay away.
B00003CXI1|2.0|Okay, so I'm a spoilsport.  This movie wasn't awful.  It also wasn't good.  It was more or less completely forgettable.  I think children would like it, but I suspect the books are vastly superior.  I have not read the Harry Potter books (although I will one day), but I am a great lover of children's literature.  From Madeline L'Engle's Wrinkle in Time Series, through Roald Dahl's magnificent Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, to Susan Cooper's The Dark is Rising series, I loved them all.  If the Harry Potter books have that quality, it somehow failed to translate to the film.  For the record, I wasn't that thrilled with the Willy Wonka movie either (although it would get 3 stars from me).
B00005QG9J|1.0|this cd is so freaken WEAK.  I listened to it while I was on a road trip, and I nearly fell asleep at the wheel!  They've definately lost their touch.  I no longer enjoy incubus because of this cd.  Their lyrics have gotten to be repetitive--almost as much as dance music has gotten these days!  Thanks to incubus, they've turned me back towards better bands like Adema, Primer 55, Blink 182, and Green Day.<br />I don't recommend this cd to anybody going on a long road trip-- not only will it make you fall asleep at the wheel, it'll make the trip seem LONGER than it actually is.
0140149295|3.0|The book is okay...but I will admit I had a tough time rooting for this guy.  Each and every problem were to some degree caused by his own behavior.  And his failure to take responsibility for his own behavior turned me off.<br />He was clearly framed, but his own actions, criminal record, and words are part of what led to his being framed.   I was disappointed that he failed to recognize this fact.
B00005JKCF|4.0|Sam Raimi, underrated director of Darkman and a little gem called \\"The Gift\\", has proved his mettle in the world of the blockbuster. Believe that Spiderman will clean up in every city in the US and also have a great ride internationally. Cinematography and special effects are phenomenal, Danny Elfman's music is outstanding. New York City is surreal, and yet the main characters are believable as natives \\"from Queens\\".<br />Casting Tobey McGuire as Parker/Spiderman was a thoughtful choice, and helped to keep the film close to the origins of the Marvel comic. Critics said the same things about Michael Keaton before they saw him play the odd Bruce Wayne in the first Batman. Kristen Dunst sparkled. Character actors in the role of the newspaper publisher (this guy is also a villain on HBO's \\"Oz\\" and a shrink on \\"Law and Order\\"; when does he rest?), and Peter's uncle (a cameo by Cliff Robertson having a bad hair day) were just cartoonish enough to help make the film.<br /> But, a film is only as good as its villain.<br />The Green Goblin is more stylish than expected, and William Dafoe is a better actor than what you would expect to be cast. But, he goes over the top and seems uncomfortable no matter which of his two personas is up for a scene. Points to the original Batman, where Jack Nicholson set the standard for all villains to come. You have to enjoy your \\"evilness\\" to get the laughs and bring a cartoon villain to life...Nicholson can, Dafoe didn't impress.<br />Still a great film; really excellent that everyone can enjoy it.
B000060P79|5.0|This album is amazing! Every song can be related to teenage life, especially &quot;I'm Just a Kid,&quot; and &quot;Perfect.&quot;  No matter what your background, it is guaranteed that you will realte to at least one song on this album! My personal favorite is &quot;When I'm with you.&quot; I also can't get enough of &quot;addicted.&quot; Every song speaks to me, and that's the reason why there is no way in hell this CD is coming out of my CD player... <br />...Kelly...<br />ps: Pat is hot
B00003CXZ1|1.0|First off, I just wanted to say that this movie [stinks]. Maybe it was all the bad reviews that I read that detered me from liking it, but I stopped watching it 30 minutes through. That's how bad it was. Stay away from it and if you must, rent it first.
B000006IUQ|4.0|This is a thrilling movie about the power of reason in overcoming all odds.  It takes three men with three different philosophies and drops them straight into a man against nature situation.  The timid and the irrational men quickly get into trouble while the creative, thinking man ends up getting... well, I won't spoil it for you but I promise this one is a keeper!<BR>:o)
B00005JKED|5.0|First off, I just want to say that this is one of the best movies I've seen in a long time. It is wonderfully put together, and even though it has a lot of profanity, it is great. The profanity is needed to accurately portray life on the streets, colored people, and gangs. Denzel Washington is a really great actor. I think that this a must-see movie and needs to be owned by everyone.
0451191153|5.0|Ayn Rand has the uncanny ability to bring to life heroes of epic proportions.  In The Fountainhead her theme is the role of an independant mind in shaping one's life as opposed to living as a second-hander who conforms to the mob and acts selflessly.  Through the progression of the hero's career, Rand demonstrates the practicallity of principled action based on self-interest.  It is amazing how simple this idea is yet even more amazing how few people have fully appreciated its power.<br />If you have never read Rand, this is a good book to start with.  take your time and enjoy it, and when you are done get Atlas Shrugged as soon as you can.  Then prepare yourself to really start living!
0780624890|5.0|First off I just want to say that this movie is very gory, so if you don't like that stuff, this movie is not for you. Of course it is gory since it is dealing with vampires, so if you don't like that either, this movie is not for you. I seen a part of this movie when someone brought it in for our class. It was the first 30 minutes, but I was still hooked. I had been wanting to see it for quite awhile though, so I was glad to see that part of it. This is a great movie and even though I never read the comic book, I still liked the movie. If you read the comic book, then you will probably like it. This is a must-see and should be owned by everyone.
B00005JKQZ|4.0|Let's face it, this is basically a made-for-TV movie with Ron Howard directing with his typical paint-by-numbers approach. What saves it is the outstanding acting of Russell Crowe. I'm amazed how a man with such a powerful build could appear so fragile. Without him, this would only be a two star movie. I can only imagine what this film could have been under the direction of David Lynch or Robert Altman.
B00005A46T|3.0|Okay, people can have their back and forth back and forth about Slipknot being a real talent or a bunch of posers,... etc.  This is a heavy album for something with so much exposure in the industry.  Period.  I don't know how many people are eating this up in bunches, but I can assure you that it's not the vast majority of young music buyers.<br />Sure, this kind of thing is always going to appeal to the young and disaffected, whatever.  I'm not a teenager anymore so what--for the first time I was able to listen to this kind of music and appreciate it.  Then I found out I liked it!  I'm not a diahard or anything, but I was just pleasantly surprised that I could really get into these songs.  This stuff revs you up if nothing else.  People = S... has a massive riff, even if you have to smirk at the chorus.  My Plague is great--it's heavy, it's got a hook (when Corey sings he's not bad at all--he should cut the screaming a little bit and sing some good melodies, cuz he can.)  Left Behind is easily the most accessible song on this album to the casual metal fan.  It's the screaming that's gonna turn a lot of people off.  In my humble, screaming and cursing themselves are not scary or offensive--what becomes offensive is the overuse for no reason but to, and then the (sometimes) subsequent corniness.  Let's face it, now that these guys are rich and famous, how are we gonna keep believing they have genuine rage?
B00003CXI1|2.0|Harry Potter is a child who attends a school for wizards.  Not much really happens in this lackluster and soulless film, and it's story is more fitting for an episode of a TV series than a monstrously budgeted children's film.  I was expecting grand adventure and fun, but got a very simple story about some kids messing around in their school trying to stop a meddling bad guy.  Really, take away their magic powers, add in more angst, and this could have been an afterschool special.
6304167660|5.0|The story line of this movie is set at the ten year high school reunion.  Listening to the characters was like going to my own reunion.  I saw myself and my buddies in these characters.  What a classic this is!  With an all-star cast including Timothy Hutton, Matt Dillon, Lauren Holly, rosie O'Donnell, natalie Portman, Michael Rapaport, Martha Plimpton, Uma Thurman and Mira Sorvino and a wonderfully matched soundtrack this movie is hard to top.  <br />Will (Timothy Hutton) is trying to figure out the path his life will take, should he get married or not.  But he is intrigued by the little girl next door and starts to think that his future wife may be a bit ordinary.  Add to the mix Uma Thurman's out of town character that is beautiful and witty and Will is getting more muddled all the time.  The local boys plow snow, drink beer and have affairs with married women, date women for nine years without proposing and raise kid with not clue how to do it.  All real life things that we see everyday with ordinary people. <br />A movie that should not be missed, that an be watched over and over and will make you laugh and ponder the relationships that people get into.
B00003CXXS|3.0|Joe Johnston takes up the directing reins over Steven Spielberg for JPIII, a relatively plotless film which basically gets a group of people to an island full of dinosaurs, with the typical chaos that ensues.  Decent second sequel is pretty entertaining for most of its running time, thanks to a returning Sam Neill (likeable as ever as Dr. Grant), a good sense of humor, and some exciting action sequences.  The special effects are mostly excellent, though the Spinosaurus (who, by the way, is NOT an improvement over the T-Rex) often appears too animatronic. Recommended, but the ending is a disappointment, however.
0783241569|4.0|Not being a Hugh Grant fan and not being a Julia Roberts fanatic I didn't even bother to see this movie when it was released in the theaters.  But I was glad that I rented it.  It was a pleasant romantic-(semi)-comedy movie.  I found myself feeling so sorry for Hugh's character and Julia's had me up and down, in and out, liking her and disliking her.  Both did a fine job but this poor man was a glutton for punishment.  It's like that when you are in love, hopelessly.  You keep going back for more and more rejection, followed by hope (can you tell it didn't work for me?).  Anyway - after I saw the movie I was enchanted with it.  A very good movie and a nice suprise.
B00003CXZ1|1.0|Starring Angelina Jolie and her huge...chin (what did you think I was gonna say?) as adventurer Lara Croft, it's too bad this movie is such a dud.  Unexciting action sequences, a [bad] lead performance from Jolie, and a general sense of MTV-style over true adventure make this one of the most boring action movies I've seen in a very, very long time.  Indiana Jones is great and so is The Mummy (1999); stick with those instead.
157492589X|5.0|Gus (Robert Duvall) and Woodrow (Tommy Lee Jones) are real cowboys.  Texas Rangers who have been lifelong friends and know what it is like to fight indians and outlaws.  They are older and retired but the fire has not left them.  <br />This movie, mini-series, was an instant classic the moment it came out.  With outstanding performances by both Duvall and Jones and the wonderful dialogue between the two characters.  The supporting cast is terrific and has many big names including Robert Ulrich, Danny Glover, Angelica Houston, Rick Schroder, Diane Lane and more.  More than the cattle drive, or the indian fighting, this movie is about friends and commitments.  Family and love.  Woodrow is as hard-nosed and Gus is a softy.  It is a movie that will stay with you for a long, long time after you watch it.  And you will want to watch it again.  <br />Buy this one, it is a must own.
B000002J1B|5.0|This album is often overlooked in favor of albums like &quot;Fragile&quot; or &quot;Close to the Edge&quot;. Maybe that's because it is less accessible. But make no mistake, &quot;Relayer&quot; is one of Yes' very best and one of the great albums of the seventies. On the first song, &quot;Gates of Delirium&quot;, the band's power is overwhelming and this song has become a favorite among Yes fans. &quot;Sound Chaser&quot; finds Yes flirting with jazz fusion and features a tremendous keyboard solo by Pat Moraz. It's too bad that Moraz stayed for only one album, because he brought something special to Yes, a gift for improv and jazz. The last song, &quot;To Be Over&quot;, is serene and beautiful and is a fitting conclusion to this exceptional record.
079213690X|5.0|What a fantastic movie!  The scenery in this movie was fabulous.  The battle scenes were very realistic for the time frame, even sometimes to the point of shock.  If you don't like violence you will probably have to leave the room during these scenes.  But they help set the harsh world in which William Wallace lived.  While this movie is not historically correct it is an interesting period piece.  And a wonderful love story.  For those that say a man can not love as deep as a woman, this love story seems to beg to differ.  There is something for both &quot;him and her&quot; in this movie and you can watch with your spouse or friend.  <br />The movie was long but time passed quickly.  The story surrounds you from the very beginning and never lets you out until the very end.  There are all kinds of heros and villans, damsels in distress, warriors, kings and tyrants throughout this movie.  The soundtrack was very good (I bought it on CD) and enhanced the overall effect of the movie.  The story, the excellent acting, the battle scenes, the soundtrack, the plot.  All lead to create a movie that stands head and shoulders above most recent ventures of any type.  <br />Buy it or rent it but absolutely you should see it.
B00005Y228|5.0|One of the most biggest dance albums of the year, Kylie Minogue brilliantly lavish to the american scene with her huge hit &quot;CAN'T GET YOU OUT OF MY HEAD&quot; peaking at #7 in March 2002 and peaked at #3 on the most played pop song on the radio. Many of you may have heard of Kylie from her first hit in the US; &quot;THE LOCOMOTION&quot; peaking at #3 in 1988. Its been more then 13 years since and Kylie has grown maturely with her music. Now let me start with the review of &quot;FEVER.&quot;'<br />01. MORE MORE MORE 3.5/5<BR>02. LOVE AT FIRST SIGHT 5/5<BR>03. CAN'T GET YOU OUT OF MY HEAD 5/5<BR>04. FEVER 4.5/5<BR>05.

BOY (BONUS) 4.2/5<BR>14. BUTTERFLY (BONUS) 4.8/5<br />&quot;LOVE AT FIRST SIGHT&quot; is Kylie's next single, but it will be served with a radio version to US radios. Oh yeah, the album peaked at #3 its first week out.
B000002LND|4.0|Wonderful compilation of madonna's best songs from the 80's.  There are some notable exclusions however.  Where is &quot;angel&quot;, &quot;dress you up&quot;, &quot;burning up&quot;?  Rather have the album versions of &quot;lucky star&quot; and &quot;holiday&quot;.  Overall, for 80's Madonna fans this is the album to own.  In my opinion, this is her last great work.  Her 90's material was less fun and she sold out to the new generation which would be fine except that her true talent was captured in the 80's.  In addition to the &quot;Immaculate Collection&quot;, 80's Madonna fans should also own her debut album and &quot;Like a Virgin&quot;.  These albums really caputure her 80's talent with material that is not on the greatest hits.
6305841861|5.0|The Evil Dead series is one that inspires one of two things in people (and in some both): fear and laughter. <br />Ash (Bruce Campbell) goes with his girlfriend to a cabin for a weekend. However things go horribly wrong when he finds a tape recorder that plays sections of the Necronomicon (Book of the Dead) thereby releasing the power of the evil deadites.<br />Evil Dead 2 is more or less a remake of the first one, just with more laughter and a more filled out plot thrown in. We finally get to see what is chasing Ash throughout the series.<br />If your introduction to the horror genre were movies like Scream, or I know what you did last summer, you might enjoy this, but every fan of really good horror (or B) movies knows this has its fair share of creep out moments.<br />The special features on this DVD are not extensive, especially by todays standards, but what you do get are great. Listening to star Bruce Campbell give his thoughts on the movie, or hearing director Sam Raimi (Spider-Man) talking about the movie is great. <br />If you're interested in seeing a horror film at the same time you want to watch comedy you can do NO wrong with this film. Buy it, rejoice in its enjyoability and watch it frequently.
B00004Z459|5.0|Linkin park is the best band i have ever heard in my life. I like every song from Hybrid Theory except Cure for the Itch(which i don't consider a real song), Runaway, and With you which is ok. Here are my ratings:<BR>1. Papercut- 9/10<BR>2. One Step Closer- 9/10<BR>3. With You- 7/10<BR>4. Points of Authority- 8/10 (after a while it gets boring, but now at first!)<BR>5. Crawling- 10/10<BR>6. Runaway- 5/10- starts out okay but not that good.<BR>7. By Myself- 10/10<BR>8. In the end- 10/10<BR>9. A place for my head- 10/10<BR>10. Forgotten 9/10<BR>11. Cure for the Itch- 5/10. Not a real song but some people seem to really like it.<BR>12. Pushing me Away- 10/10<BR>Overall rating: 12/10. BEST CD EVER. I used to like some of the songs more but some get old after 6 months. The mere fact that others don't says something!
B00003CXZ1|4.0|As a long time Tomb Raider gamer, I was anticipating the release of Lara Croft: Tomb Raider for years.  The storyline seems more like an introduction than a richly written adventure.  I read the novel based on the original screenplay, which would have made this movie more appealing to critics had the editor not been so scissor happy.  Angelina Jolie IS Lara Croft.  She did a great job of portraying her with perfection.  The fight scenes are creative and exciting.  I recommend this DVD just so you can see some deleted scenes, check out the clever fight scenes and marvel at the way Angelina Jolie has created Lady Croft with absolute flawlessness.
079074404X|3.0|The Good:<br />The animation sequences, sets and gizmos are great. I love Robby and the monster is fantastic, wonderful and convincing. I even enjoyed the synthesizer music just because it seemed to belong.<br />The 'villain' (he is an unwitting villain, really) Morbius is great and acts his part with gusto. I love that the sliding doors are absolutely silent and don't require that silly squeaky noise in star trek - this adds to the idea of the advanced alien race. Lots of people die - you don't see any remains but you get the idea of what happens to them through the script - which is as good as a vat of gore. There are no wires or strings visible!<br />The Bad:<br />On the other hand, why would men (commanding officers even)on a strange and very hostile planet treat this as an exotic port on earth and go looking for a bit of crumpet? I thought the captain and his officers were pretty dumb not to concentrate entirely on the mystery at hand and instead were gaga over this strange woman (personally I would be more worried about a monster ripping me in half...but I digress). Oh well...the fast forward button was pretty handy for some of the wretched 'love' scenes. <br />Yes, this movie is definitely a product of the 50s! Still worth watching.
B00005OAIE|1.0|...and his name is John Mayer!<br />Never in my life have I heard a more benign, edgeless, ordinary album. John Mayer will not amaze, inspire nor make you think anything you haven't already before...when you were thirteen!<br />Between his chamber-poppy quasi-jazz that belongs more on an easy listening station, than on top 40, to his Dave Matthews sounding voice, one wonders what <i>was</i> the point of this album.<br />It's so uninspiring and the sick part is most of is fans are fans of Dave Matthews who he seems to be mimicking at every opportunity. But where Dave at least brings something to the table, John should be exiled to the kiddy one. He's a one man N*SYNC who writes his own music and plays an instrument- a BB Mak rolled into one if you will! A one man \\"bland\\".<br />With songs like \\"Neon\\" and \\"Your Body Is a Wonderland\\" one would question whether John has actually ever even been in a relationship or had sex! And songs like the popular opening track \\"No Such Thing\\" which boasts a line \\"I wanna run through the halls of my high school, I wanna scream at the top of my lungs, I just found out there's such thing as a real world, just a lie you got to rise above\\"...need I say more? He should be featured on a Fox show, \\"When Shallow People Act Deep\\".<br />So if you are a twenty something college girl who feels all weird inside cause gosh, you don't know if that uber cute boy in the Abercrombie & Fitch hat across the quad likes you; you know, the one with Greek letters on his shirt and the shell necklace? Well then you might enjoy this album, otherwise skip it and buy a Dave Matthews album, preferably \\"Crash\\".
B0000508U6|4.0|Coldplay is a rarity; a band with heart, talent, texture, and a generally positive attitude. This is a great disc, one of the best of the year. Everyone has already made Radiohead comparisons. All I will add is that they seem to be Radiohead with a positive outlook. Of course, that is not completely fair. Coldplay are a legitimate band in their own right; indeed, they won the british equivalent of the Grammy for best rock album last year. <br />I like everything on this disc, especially 'Spies' (a brooding, dark song that is the albums high point) and 'We never change'. Great stuff. 'Shiver' is a fun tune and 'Everything's not lost' is a GREAT closer. Worth checking out if you like alternative/headphone rock.<br />Highly recommended.
B00005OAIE|5.0|At a time when the music industry is being saturated with bubble-gum pop garbage and grunge bands trying to recapture the emotion of the early 90's, it is refreshing to hear an artist who is truly able to put out a couple of honestly good clean songs with catchy tunes. Granted, it is inevitable that John Mayer will be compared ruthlessly to Dave Matthews, and that eventually he will also achieve a similar type of mainstream success, but that still does not detract from the type of music he is making. For most college students, such as myself, who are sick of having to endure the perpetual radiowaves of Britney and N'Sync, John Mayer's simple melodies and gentle voice are a welcome arrival. &quot;Love Song for No One&quot; and &quot;Your Body is a Wonderland&quot; are beautiful in their simplicity, and the album itself reminds me in some ways of the clean sound that the new Weezer album had, although the mcusical style is obviously different. Mayer is like a less-edgy Counting Crows and in the mold of bands like Guster and The Lemonheads, although he probably would not like those comparisons. Regardless, I highly recommend this album. Watch out for this guy.
B00003CXI1|5.0|I had never read any of the Harry Potter books before seeing Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone.  I was enchanted by the story and the film in general.  I bought and read all the Harry Potter books within the next week.<br />I have seen the movie eleven times.  The movie follows the book fairly well.  There are some minor differences between the book and the movie and some things in the book just didn't make it into the film.  Peeves the Poltergist is probably the biggest thing missing from the movie.  However, the spirit of the book shines through.<br />I thought the movie was cast very well.  The special effects are wonderful and not overdone.
B00000K31V|2.0|Almost a three. I remember Roger Ebert saying this was better than \\"The Matrix\\". Takes a cheap spin on the old \\"and then they woke up\\" ending.<BR>note: I'm aware of what the ending implies, but it's not that original of an idea, believe it or not Mark Twain wrote something similar in \\"No. 44 The Mysterious Stranger\\", therefore I think the Matrix was more original. I also don't like the game idea because it implies there's a human like creator, and a winner. So I say if all these people are allowed to say their views on reality, I'll say one of mine. In western music the scale is divided into 12 notes(chromatic scale) if you play these notes from top to bottom they sound like nothing. \\"Which ones are the good notes which are the bad?\\" None of them. It's not until you divide the notes in a way to form a reference point, for example the C major scale(cdefgabc). Starting from C it sounds all happy but if you start from the next note up, d,  it will sound dark. These are called the modes, there's 7 of them in the major scale. So I'm saying it's not until there's a reference point that things can be distinguished, so therefore being human is a reference point. I also like the existing yet not existing quality of music, and the same song can be played on many places of the world at the same time, and there isn't really a human like creator nor is there a winner.
B00005JKBC|5.0|I love it! The Best spy movie There is. Tony Scott is a great Director,all of his movies rock like \\"Enemy of the State\\",\\"The Last Boyscout\\",\\"Crimson Tide\\".  Redford and Pitt are great teamed up just like Hackman and Smith in Enemy of the State. Tony knows how to kick [bottom]. A Five star movie!
0393312836|4.0|I thought A Clockwork Orange was a great book!  All though at times hard to understand, the \\"nadsat talk\\" was very interesting.  It is a book I would recommend to anyone who would like an inside view to the corrupt ways societ works.  An interesting event happens in the middle of the book to bring it to a great peak and a terrific ending.
B000002I7R|4.0|I have most of Robert Plant's other solo releases and this one is as good as the rest.  This one is probably the most Zep like.  All through out you hear Blunt emulating Page type riffs and grooves.  If you like Plant or Zeppelin, this one is for you.
B00005JKCF|5.0|For those of us who have been waiting literally years for this, one of the greatest comic book series ever, to come to larger-than-life enormity on the big screen, this film is a godsend. One of the very few 'event movies' to actually live up to its hype, SPIDER-MAN (2002), as brilliantly directed by the wonderful Sam Raimi (one of the most successful cult directors in film history), delivers BIG-TIME!! It is perfectly cast, from Tobey Maguire in the title role--probably the role he was born to play--to Willem Dafoe, as his dreaded arch-enemy, to the beautiful Kirsten Dunst, the girl he would love to ask out on a date.<br />Actually, I knew that Tobey Maguire would be perfect as the nerdy, super-shy Peter Parker, who of course turns into Spider-man after being bitten by a genetically altered, and very colorful, red-and-blue spider in a science lab. I've seen Maguire in both PLEASANTVILLE (1997) and THE CIDER HOUSE RULES (1999) and I just knew that he fit Peter Parker to a T. Also perfectly cast is Willem Dafoe, as well-meaning corporate head Norman Osborne, who of course gives in to his evil side to become the fearsome Green Goblin. Kirsten Dunst, as sweet-but-troubled Mary Jane Watson, finds just the right note in her performance; her M.J. is pretty but not overly glamorous, talented but underachieving, desirable but not inaccessible. I've been following Dunst's career ever since seeing her remarkable debut, INTERVIEW WITH THE VAMPIRE (1994), for which she should have been nominated for Best Supporting Actress, and I can say that she is every bit as deserving as Tobey Maguire for starring in such a wonderful film, which by the way just smashed all box-office opening-week records ($115 million). Now both actors are finally getting their due recognition!<br />Also finally getting his due recognition is director Sam Raimi, who first made the splatter-fest THE EVIL DEAD (1983), and the even better (and funnier) EVIL DEAD 2 (1987), before going on to direct the wonderful DARKMAN (1990) and then finishing the EVIL DEAD trilogy with ARMY OF DARKNESS (1993). More known to a wide TV audience as the exec producer of the \\"Hercules\\" and \\"Xena\\" series, Sam Raimi is now making his triumphant return to feature films. And what a triumph this film is!<br />SPIDER-MAN has action, fun, brains, brawn, suspense, and most importantly, a great storyline which blends the traditional comic-book story with modern-day realism. Sam Raimi and the screenwriter found a way to not alienate the original fans, while incorporating today's hip humor and attitudes. Plus, it was filmed in my original hometown of New York City! :)<br />To sum up: Great cast, great acting, great action, great story, great direction, great visuals, filmed in NYC. I can't wait to see it again, and I can't wait to own it on DVD! Now, the questions that may be on your mind if you haven't yet seen it: Does Spider-man conquer evil? Is he conquered instead?? Does he get the girl??? The answers to these questions are not so obvious; you have to go out and see it, and find out for yourself!!!! MOST RECOMMENDED
B00005YXZH|2.0|My first listen to this album was on September 13th, 2001 - two days after the attack on the World Trade Center. It was errie to listien to tracks like &quot;Jesus, Etc.&quot; with it's chorus of &quot;tall buildings shake, voices escape singing sad, sad songs&quot; and the following &quot;War on War&quot; and &quot;Ashes of the American Flag.&quot; The irony that these three tracks were written prior to the worst attacks on this nation's soil is chilling. <br />Aside from that, I don't think this LP deserves all the hype. I think &quot;Summerteeth&quot; is a much more well-crafted and experimental album, and &quot;a.m.&quot; remains my personal favorite (let's not even talk about the abysmal &quot;Being There&quot;). &quot;Yankee Foxtrot Hotel&quot; feels like it's trying to hard. <br />There is just irony though. Apparently this album debuted somewhere really high, like 20 or 13 on the Billboard charts. This a year after they were dropped from their previous label. Whoever dropped them must be eating some serious crow right about now. It's good to see a band with some integrity is still able to &quot;move product&quot;(as it is so sadly called these days). <br />Worth a spin, but nowhere near as brilliant as &quot;Summerteeth&quot; or &quot;a.m.&quot;, and nowhere near as brilliant as everyone is saying.
B000059XYL|5.0|I think this movie is inspiring to songwriters and singers. If you work hard to acheive what your dreams are and then they just might come true. Even through the bad times and good go for your goal. Watch this movie it is awsome!!!!!!!!!!
B00003CXWV|1.0|Uninvolving and trite. Johnny Depp is a truly gifted actor, and it is sad that he was pulled into this fiasco of a movie. The major and glaring flaw that I saw in this film was that we were never able to empathize with the main characters... any of them. They all pretty much got what they deserved from beginning to end, and you were actually glad to see the main character losing everything. Scarface, Chopper, Silence of the Lambs, The Godfather... these are all films that had nasty protagonists that you could feel something for. I kept finding myself watching the timer on my DVD player... counting down the minutes until Blow would go away. Thankfully, it did.
B00005JKCF|5.0|My son begged and pleaded with me to take him to see it. So, the good parent that I am, braved the lines and went on opening night. After seeing countless episodes of the Batman movies, I was leery of the dark and extremely long movie plots with the introduction of so many characters in such a short period of time, but I gave it a chance. This was not the case with Spiderman. I went in with reserved expectations and came out thoroughly entertained. Spiderman took you away from the realities of the real world for a couple of hours.  Which is why I enjoyed it so much.  It was good entertainment.  It did not have the dark and dismal undertones of its comic book predecessor, Batman. Spiderman snared you in its web right from the beginning of the movie and you were totally unable to be pulled away. What Jack Nicholson did for the Joker, William Dafoe did for the Green Goblin. This movie was completely entertaining. Tobey McGuiere was a dream fit for his alter ego Peter Parker/Spiderman.  A must see and a must have for your video collection.
B000002H97|5.0|About 10 years ago, I was captivated gby this album and still am to this day. I am a black man who primarily listens to hiphop(and still do), but one day I saw the Enter Sandman video and actually liked it.One of my white friend let me listen to the album and I couldn't put it down! It's slower than their previous albums,and more of a bluesy feel, which I like being a fan of the blues. I an a music teacher and Sandman and Wherever I amy roam was preformed by my concert band in our tribute to 90's popular music concert. This a great album for any fan of music; buy it!
B00005BL2A|4.0|While &quot;Exciter&quot; seems to have dissapointed some Depeche Mode fans who have claimed that albums such as &quot;Ultra&quot; and &quot;Violator&quot; to be of superior quality, I would have to dispute their arguments by saying that I wouldn't agree as Exciter in itself is a different album like all DM albums.<br />Exciter, so far, is one of the best albums so far beginning this decade. In this album, we can hear a much more mature DM. Gahan's voice is much more relaxed and improved; compared to &quot;Ultra&quot;, his singing flows nicely w/ the songs he sings. Gore's softer vocals is as smooth as ever and has not changed. <br />While most of the music on Exciter is softer, usually slow to mid tempo, some of the faster and rougher songs such as &quot;I Feel Loved&quot; and &quot;Dead of the Night&quot; are interesting listens. &quot;I Feel Loved&quot; is definitely a good club classic while &quot;Dead of the Night&quot; pokes good fun at industrial music. <br />Some of the best highlights in the album are &quot;When the Body Speaks&quot;, a very gentle and soft track as well as &quot;Breathe&quot; which has a slight jazzy sound in it (also listing many bible names). Each of the tracks on the album are significant in their own right.<br />Some qualms w/ this album is probably the arrangements. Somehow, the album seems a bit disjointed. While each of the songs are good in their own right, somehow, some of it just doesn't fit all that perfectly (IE - &quot;Dead of the Night&quot;). Some of the song titles such as &quot;Sweetest Condition&quot; seem as though they have randomly re-used names off their album &quot;Violator&quot;.<br />Overall, I think that the album is a good album and once again, DM have proved that they can still run strong even through many years of making music.
B00005YXZH|5.0|I'll admit, I bought this album because of the whole deal with the record label dispute. How Reprise Records hated it and refused to release it and, in fact, asked Wilco to pack it up and get off the label, and, of course, Nonesuch Records picking this album up and releasing it to so much critical praise. I just had to hear what was going on. Was it really so bad that Reprise could have passed it up? Or was it really good enough to be drawing all this attention, now? The answer is: yes. Yes to both questions. If you're a record executive doing nothing but pumping new albums by the Back-'SYNC-98°-Britney-Aguilera-EMINEM-Ja-Lo-Staind machine into America's awful excuse for rock radio (operated by the Third-Riech of broadcasting, ClearChannel), then Wilco's \\"Yankee Hotel Foxtrot\\" is nothing to you but disaster. I mean, for God's sake, who would dare use excessive guitar feed back to mold haunting melodies and vibraphones to gently accent phrases underneath genuine raw emotion in Jeff Tweedy's cracking, passionate voice? Who would dare record songs not written by Diane Warren or that fat guy who runs all the boy bands, but insted, release songs that come through as being written by a band? Each instrument speaking in it's own voice, changing from track to track, being heard like it's never been heard before? The Reprise executives knew they couldn't sell this to 13 year-old girls in pink tank-tops or 15 year-old boys in huge FUBU pants and backwards visors, so they canned it. Thank God for Nonesuch Records, who knew that there are people out there who do still appreciate music. People who will take a chance on something new, something real. So, yes. This album really is so good to deserve the attention. From the opening track, \\"I Am Trying to Break Your Heart,\\" a haunting effects-driven track that pulses through it's 6+ minutes without ever latching on to a beat (but still grooving harder than La-Rule ever could), this album gets under your skin. There are the pop songs, of course, but not pop in any sort of TRL way. Tracks like \\"Heavy Metal Drummer\\" are pop done right. Simple melodies, but what's interesting, here, is the production. Are the drums live? Are they sampled? Who knows! What the hell was that alarm-clock-acoustic-mandolin-sounding thing? Who knows! But it all sounds great. The Amazon.com Editor said it well. It sounds like some fantastic, weird, late-night radio broadcast from some demented station coming out of (more than likely) London. My favorite track on the album is #5. \\"Jesus, Etc.\\" I don't know what I could compare the sound of this track to, but it's fantastic. It's a gentle, sort-of lounge act groove, and the lyrics are truly inspired. \\"You were right about the stars; each one is a setting sun. Tall buildings shake, voices escape, singing sad, sad songs...\\" How good is that? Absolutly poetic. Perhaps this'll be a wake-up call to major labels. They'll realize bands like Wilco can sell albums, even without massive radio air play. For more music that's as new and different and spectacular as Wilco, try Doves, Super Furry Animals, Spiritualized, Ryan Adams, or Ed Harcourt. (That list could go on quite a while, but I'll stop there.) So, \\"Yankee Hotel Foxtrot\\" is as good as they say it is. And as bad as Reprise Records claims, by some standards. I do own \\"Summerteeth,\\" but I lost it. I definitely think I'll be searching for it, soon.s, of course, but not pop in any sort of TRL way.

B00004XONN|5.0|Eh, maybe, but does it matter? Kid A, when released in the end of 2000, was received under a firestorm of criticism, mostly rave reviews. &quot;Saviors of rock,&quot; they were called. Aside from a very few promotional performances (doing Idioteque on Saturday Night Live), you hardly saw Radiohead basking in its commercial glory (at least over here in the States). Kid A is definitely not a commercially-oriented album.<br />The opening keyboard of 'Everything In Its Right Place' automatically throws the listener for a loop. Creating a mood that is, very much, cold and distant. The title track, with an organ effect that sounds almost child-like and playful, combined with a dark, distored vocal really generates confusion. The album is paced very much like vinyl album, with a Side 1 and Side 2, where side 1 has the more &quot;out there&quot; stuff, while side 2 has tracks more dominated by Yorke with clear hooks and beats. This is very much enjoyed as a whole album though a few quick highlights include the opening song, 'The National Anthem,' with its rocking bassline, 'Morning Bell,' and the last piece 'Motion Picture Soundtrack,' with its ethereal organ and harp effect. <br />Kid A, while adventurous, is not totally obtuse and impossible to listen to unless you're an art school grad. On the other hand it is definitely not mainstream music that every person who listens to &quot;alternative&quot; radio will enjoy. Don't be thrown off if you don't like it the first listen, I know I didn't. Now it's my favorite Radiohead album (and I still love Pablo Honey and The Bends).
B00005JKCF|5.0|For as long as I can recall, I have always been enamored by Spider-Man.  As a young child, I remember watching reruns of the 60s cartoon and the live action series of the 70s thinking that they were cool.  In the 80s there was Spider-Man and His Amazing Friends (Fire Star and Ice Man) and I thought this was even better.  In the 90s Fox brought the character back to Saturday mornings among all of the ridiculous teen shows which replaced the cartoons of years gone by.  Now, finally we get a live action motion picture of my favorite neighborhood do-gooder.<br />Hollywood reports that the idea has been bandied around for nearly 20 years and it is a good thing that we have waited.  Like the continuing Star Wars saga, the things done in this thrill-a-minute epic could not have been achieved ten years ago.  The action sequences would not have been plausible without the leaps made by the animators and computers of today.  The awesome sequence wherein Spidey leaps on and over gigantic balloon figures could only recently be realized.  But all of the breathtaking visuals are not what makes this movie special.  There is so much more.<br />All of the lore surrounding the origin of Spidey is seen.  Bravo to Sam Raimi, a true Spider-Man afficianado!!!!  Peter Parker is raised by his Uncle Ben and Aunt May.  He is bitten by a genetically altered spider and given amazing powers.  We see Peter grow from a socially outcast teenager into an adult who has flaws.  As in the comic, Peter learns a painful lesson from Uncle Ben.  This is one of my favorite all-time lines anywhere : \\"WITH GREAT POWER COMES GREAT RESPONSIBILITY.\\"  Stan Lee wrote those words 40 years ago in the premiere edition of The Amazing Spider-Man comic book, and they are as much a part of this movie as they were then.<br />The entire cast was super!!! Tobey Maguire is brilliant as both Parker and Spider-Man.  He is a geeky four-eyed egghead who can't even talk to M.J. The audience can feel the exuberance as Peter discovers and begins to experiment with his new power. Kirsten Dunst is so much more than the typical cardboard cutout heroine.  Willem Dafoe is masterful as the Jekyll/Hyde-ish Green Goblin.  James Franco was also great as the outcast son who takes a back seat to Peter for the attention of his father.<br />This fantastic movie definately screams sequel.  My wish is that Mr. Raimi helms all of them and the cast remains intact  Hopefully, the characters will evolve so that the films will become better than other notable superhero franchises which fell by the wayside after their first time out.  Superman and Batman became laughable after each sequel because their characters were not developed.  Tobey Maguire at least will make sure that this will not happen.  Sam Raimi's passion for the characters should be realized.  Bring on Doc Oc!!!!
B000021Y7X|5.0|I've loved Talking Heads since about 1977 when Talking Heads '77 came out, after More Songs about Buildings and Food came out in 1978 I was hooked.<br />This DVD is a wonderful performance video directed by Jonathan Demm.  It starts out with Byrne walking out alone on the stage, with a small ghetto blaster and his acoustic guitar to accompany him.  The bass player joins him on the next song and so on and so on till the stage has a full compliment of performers. The effect is wonderful, and if you have feet, they will be very happy by the third song when the drummer joins in.  There is a great feeling of growing enthusiasm as members of the troupe add themselves to the mix.  If you've seen the original video, and have a DVD player with surround sound; this will be an upgraded experience musically and visually.  The 5.1 Dolby Digital is very clean and well mixed, and it sounds impressive in stereo 2.0 Dolby on my old Sansui's, and newer Bose Bookshelf Speakers. (one reviewer mentioned PCM Stereo as an option?) <br />Somehow I've managed to never see this video before, but after a friend raved about it being his favorite music performance video and it being directed by Jonathan Demme etc etc etc, I ordered it from Amazon.com.  It is a \\"must have\\" if you like Talking Heads.  The assortment of songs they perform is fairly definitive and presented in a satisfying order.  My only complaint with the whole presentation is the lack of one of my favorite pieces, \\"Artists Only\\", from More Songs about Buildings and Food. The artist choices; from lighting, to set design, to costume and hair are all very effective individually, yet add up to a greater whole.  The direction is simplistic in it's approach, eliminating distracting jump-cuts to close-ups and audience shots. The camera concentrates on the performers and lets them be the stars in this show. There is no lack of motion on this stage, everyone is dancing and jumping to the music in the apparent joy they are sharing while making this.  Their enthusiasm is contagious! <br />This is now added to my growing list of favorite music DVD's; some of which include: Blondie Live in New York, Santana's Supernatural Live, Stevie Ray Vaughn Live at the El Mocambo, the Offspring's \\"Huck it!\\", and Steely Dan's \\"Two Against Nature\\". <br />5 stars! ... Check it out!
B00005JKCF|5.0|Spiderman was an excellent movie. The action and special effects were simply superb. It had a good and reasonable plot and would appeal to people of any taste. Even people who like romance movies will like the relationship between Peter Parker and Mary Jane Watson. The villain was almost as cool as Spiderman. The action scenes between Green Goblin and Spiderman will definitely make this movie something to be remembered. This movie was better than even the Xmen in my opinion and I liked the Xmen. The success of this movie will also make it possible for other superhero movies to make it to the theater. The Hulk, Ironman, Fantastic Four, Xmen 2, and the Spiderman sequal just to name a few. Marvel movies may even surpass DC(Superman and Batman) movies one day.
B00005YXZH|4.0|Like so many people I'd been awaiting a new release from Wilco for some time now. At first I have to say I felt slightly let down by &quot;Yankee Hotel Foxtrot&quot;-it is a far more 'difficult' album then &quot;Summerteeth&quot; say. In fact it has taken several weeks of listening to this c.d. almost religiously before I've begun to discover it's remarkable depth. When I heard the first track I thought briefly that this was Wilco doing a Radiohead Kid A-not that there were any similarities in the music but more that the arrangements were highly unusual and at times not overly melodic. In fact the first few tracks have a pattern of alternating between the very experimental to the totally familiar sounds of Wilco's previous work. I mean the first track starts off with  disinterested Tweedy vocals,some off-key piano noises and ends with some unusual and harsh distortion(this lasts for about 2 minutes). It's only when you give this track several listens that you appreciate the truly wondrous melodic moments-such as when the piano-keyboard arrives in properly after 3 mins. Track 3 is more experimentation-Tweedy sounds totally disenchanted with life-the arrangements are like underplayed almost disturbing-again reveals itself after many listens. &quot;Ashes Of American Flags&quot; has a sinister sound from the guitars-but then you can hear some beautiful arrangements seeping in very subtly. When I first heard this track I was overwhelmed by how dull it was-now I adore it.<br /> Interspersed with the difficult tracks are some simple glorious melodies. &quot;Kamera&quot; and &quot;War On War&quot; will please all fans of the last c.d.-Kamera being my favourite. It's a very laid-back track, acoustic guitar, nice rhythm section and gentle keyboards and truly amazing harmonies towards the end. &quot;Jesus, etc&quot; is a great track and starts off a section which illustrates the total diversity of this group. It belongs in the dreaded &quot;Alt/Country&quot; tag-fiddle soundswonderful steel guitar-it has the gentle pace of beautiful, simple country life. &quot;Heavy Metal Drummer&quot; with it's wonderful lyrics is one of the more commercial tracks on the c.d.-the best part about it is that all the arrangements are so pure and simple unlike the first tracks. Track 8 seems to remind me of a later day Beatles track-especially the guitar and drums. Yet the next track has an intro sounds so like The Cure. When I think of all this diversity, it really excites me to speculate which way the next Wilco c.d. will go.<br /> The last two tracks are pretty long. &quot;Poor Places&quot; is ambles along very slowly-again it has some very strange piano and distorted arrangements-but then it mixes in the experimental with the accessible as bit by bit the piano becomes clearer,instruments have a more truly defined sound and we get a lush chorus. The contrast is fascinating. The closing track is another slow introspective track that takes quite a while to get into. I'm not sure what the break is all about, 4 minutes in though? I don't now how anyone could truly review this c.d. accurately unless you've listened to it lots of times and in varying moods. On my first few listens I was ready to slate it-but after some hard work my opinion has changed completely.
B00005JKCF|5.0|Who is he? You sure you want to know? Tobey Maguire (\\"The Cider House Rules\\"), one of the finest young actors today, is...\\"Spider-Man\\"! I have seen this film twice at the theater and I can't get enough of it! \\"Spider-Man\\" is smart, funny, and action-packed all the way from start to finish! The director of this film, Sam Raimi (\\"Darkman\\"), did not just a great job, but an outstanding job in bringing this Marvel comic book adaption to life on the big screen! I am sure that everyone knows the story of Spider-Man and that he needs no introduction. But for those who don't, then here it is. \\"Spider-Man\\" focuses on Peter Parker (Maguire), a mild-mannered high school student who lives with his aunt May (Rosemary Harris) and uncle Ben (Cliff Robertson) in Queens, New York. Peter is in love with a beautiful, yet stunning young lady named Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst), who has lived next door to Peter since they were little. One day, during a field trip to a laboratory involving the research of spiders, Peter accidentally gets bitten by one of the spiders. But to me, this was a blessing as Peter started to develop these powers and abilities to move and think like a spider, such as shooting webs from the wrist, climbing up walls, etc. And before you know it, Peter Parker is now the amazing \\"Spider-Man\\"! During the movie, Peter learns an invaluable lesson from his uncle Ben: \\"With great power, comes great responsibility\\". And soon enough, the abilities of Peter/Spider-Man will be put to the ultimate test as he faces his greatest challenge yet...the villainous Green Goblin, whose alter ego is an ambitious, yet ruthless businessman named Norman Osborn (Willem Dafoe), who also has a somewhat frustrated son named Harry (James Franco), who is also Peter Parker's best friend. And the movie goes on from there with lots of explosive action and then some! Let me just say that I think that they have picked the right actor for the role of Spider-Man, and that I have to give a lot of credit to Tobey Maguire for his physical abilities and his unique sense of acting that brought him to the role of a lifetime. I also have to give a lot of credit to Willem Dafoe for his role of the Green Goblin. Dafoe is at his villainous best since Ian McKellen's Magneto in 2000's \\"X-Men\\"! And the credit also goes to Kirsten Dunst for her very sweet performance as Mary Jane, and to Cliff Robertson and Rosemary Harris as Peter's guardians throughout the years. With state-of-the-art special effects, a great soundtrack, ground-pounding action and suspense, laugh-out-loud humor, lots of emotion, a top-notch cast that is hard to beat, and storytelling that is just perfection in every way possible, \\"Spider-Man\\" is, to me, 20 times better than what \\"X-Men\\" gave you 2 years ago! This is not just the best film of 2002, this is the greatest blockbuster of 2002! \\"Spider-Man\\" is, without a doubt, a DVD must-have for any Spider-Man fan! I cannot wait for the \\"Spider-Man\\" sequels!
B00005Q45W|4.0|Very seldom have I listened to a song which gave me an overwehlming urge to run out and buy a cd. This was the exception to the rule, I heard &quot;Thousand Kisses Deep&quot; by chance on public radio and was very impressed. I wrote down the name Leonard Cohen on a piece of paper in my car and ran out and grabbed two of his cd's immediatley.<BR>My only regret is that I hadn't heard anything from Leonard sooner, as he has been around for a long time. I called my musically inclined friend (everyone should either have one, or be one) and learned alot about Leonard, and how fans have been waiting about a decade for a new Cohen cd to come out. I don't know the best words to describe his music, mellow, somewhat endearing, pleasantly depressing, a little bit folkish. This cd is incredble, I'm glad I stumbled into it.
B000002OVJ|4.0|I often have a problem with live concert albums by rock bands. Generally, they are done before large audiences that tend to be somewhat noisy, so the bands tend to go for the obvious and the loud rather than the subtle, and playing often sounds sloppy compared to what is achieved in the studio. In this case however, we have the Who- certainly, in 1970, in contention for the title of the world's greatest rock'n'roll band- and probably the best live act. The assault of the rhythm section- Keith Moon on drums on John Entwistle on bass, combined with Townsend's loud guitar riffing and soloing and Daltry's bluesy yawp- all made the Who a force to be reckoned with. <br />Along with the loudly obvious, the Who actually go for the subtle too here.  Not only do they play rockers like &quot;Heaven and Hell&quot; (a concert opener at the time, written by John Entwistle), &quot;Young Man Blues&quot;, and &quot;My Generation&quot;, but we also hear &quot;Tatoo&quot;, one of the highlights of the &quot;Who Sells Out&quot;, the high harmonies of &quot;I'm a Boy&quot;, and a rendition of the &quot;mini-opera&quot; &quot;A Quick One While He's Away&quot; that far surpasses the original. <br />All in all an enjoyable album, best played loud.
6305090564|3.0|Enjoyable movie about a squid that eats a cruise ship full of people. Treat Williams is a decent action hero and Famke Janssen is a good female lead. The dialogue is funny, crisp and the direction from Stephen Sommers is good. I was satisfied with the action and also liked Sommers' \\"Mummy\\" pictures. Plenty of special effects to grab attention from the most maniacal science-fiction fans. A good movie!
B00004RYZT|5.0|If you are a Rammstein fan, this is a must have!<BR>The interviews are great, and the concert is well directed and edited.
0380789035|3.0|I liked this book but I didn't love it and that's where I have a problem. NO, loving every book you read would be great but it never happens. I am talking about the fact that this book had the potential to be one that you read and re-read and never forget; instead, I have already forgotten most of what I read. The premise is interesting and everything is very creative but it just seemed insubstantial in the long run. Am I sad I read it? No, it was easy to read. That is one thing that is great about Gaiman, he writes very well. It's just the story where things get muddied. I realize you must have suspension of disbelief but some things would happen that made absolutely no sense in relation to the main plot. Some feel this adds to the book but I feel it hurts the mood. There are better books out there, go read them.
B0000542DH|1.0|I love violence in movies.  For crying out loud I watch tons of action films, suspense, horror, sci-fi, and the list could go on.  However this is one of those films that has become a cult classic only because of how over the top, and the ultimatly controversial it is.<br />The story revolves around a red neck couple (Woody Harrelson adn Juliete Louise) who in the course of three weeks kill 52 people in a nation wide killing spree.  They are ruthless, violent, fairly comedic, and madly in love.  However they are the main focus on magazines and tv for the time they are doing this.  They get arrested and than one year later Robert Downey Jr. interviews Harrelson right after the super bowl.  What then follows is an incredibly violent, gory and stupid time period of non stop violence and gore.<br />SO why do i hate this?  For one thing the plot is so absurd, shallow, and MTV style music video garbage that you are left in a strange amount of attention ...  This was so violent that Joe Liberman picked this title and teamed it up with the game Doom to increase the power of ratings and decrease the amount of violence, sex, language, and over all adult content in everything so the world can be a happy go lucky utopia that will never occur.  For Oliver Stones credit though he did do a good job for making a watchable film, it's just a shame it's so violent ...that many would rather watch Titanic or Bridget Jones Diary again for the thousandth time.
B000002MU3|4.0|After the the relatively quiet strums and hums of their previous two albums, including their masterpiece \\"Automatic for the People\\", REM opts for loud fuzz, bang, and clatter. Even so, amidst the noise the sublime melodies and harmonies that make \\"Automatic\\" such a pleasure to listen to somehow crop up here as well. Even the loud \\"Let Me In\\" has a beautiful organ background. \\"Star 69\\" is simply a great rock song. \\"King of Comedy\\" has a great melody and hooks, and it rocks. \\"Crush With Eyeliner\\" is a funny song, with Stipe declaring \\"I'm In-fat-u-ated\\"! and \\"I'm the real thing\\". The one quiet song on the album, \\"Tongue\\", seems like a takeoff on Smokey Robinson, but it's great- Micheal Stipe sings falsetto, and I'm just in-fat-u-ated by that organ sound!
B00000JPYD|4.0|Thanks goodness for Kazaa where I had the chance to rediscover this suberb album. Classic blues/rock where Robin Trower on guitar shows his stuff. The slow moody blues title track is the best. Other greats are the rocking 'too rolling stoned' and 'lady love'. Trower has been considered as too simliar to Hendrix but this album shows a progression from that style. The sultry vocals of bass player James Dewar are also a highlight. The only fault with the album is the live tracks, while interesting, are unnecessary given the impact of the original tracks. The record companies would be foolish to take Kazaa of the air, I have 10 albums queued up to be bought from music that I have had the chance to hear.
B00005RFAI|5.0|I have never heard of this artist before; I bought it for one song but ended up loving 90% of the disc! This CD has a great mix of R&amp;B and urban with a touch of edge-y blues sounds.
B00003CXXR|4.0|To put it bluntly, Jurassic Park 3 isn't as good as the other two<BR>Jurassic Park films. Even so, JP3 is a riveting adventure film, set on a forest island filled with dinosaurs. The storyline concerns a thirteen year-old boy who becomes stranded on the dinosaur island in a motorboat crash. Then two tourists, a man and his wife, approach Alan Grant, a famous paleontologist, requesting that he fly them over the dinosaur island, for an aerial tour of the former Jurassic Park, now inhabited by living dinosaurs. But the tourists are not what they seem. The two tourists turn out to be the stranded boy's parents, determined to find their son. When Alan Grant refuses to land the plane on such a dangerous island, the tourist's companion knocks him out cold, then they land the plane. When a t-rex attacks the landed crew, they attempt to escape by taking off again. Instead, the plane crashes, and the crew finds themselves stranded. Now they must struggle to survive the dangerous island filled with dinosaurs. <br />Jurassic Park 3 is a must-see to anyone who is a fan of Jurassic Park. However, one does not have to be a Jurassic Park fan in order to enjoy this movie. The film pulls off a surprise ending that will indeed surprise you. Rated PG-13 for intense sci-fi terror and violence.
B000002LOE|4.0|I bought this album in 1991, mainly because &quot;Losing My Religion&quot; was on the radio, and not only was it a radio hit, it was actually a great song! I liked the album from the first, although there were parts (like &quot;Endgame&quot;,&quot;Belong&quot; and &quot;Texarkana&quot;) where the vocals and/or strings seemed a bit overly sweet to me. But I like them now. But I've never really warmed much to &quot;Me in Honey&quot;. Not that it's bad, but it's not very interesting, musically. But although &quot;Shiny Happy People&quot;'s lyrics may be off-putting to some, they're nice enough to me, and it sure is catchy. Better though are &quot;Low&quot;, with its moody organ, and &quot;Half a World Away&quot; a harpsichord-driven number that is simply one of REM's best. I have also grown to love &quot;Near Wild Heaven&quot;. &quot;Country Feedback&quot; is a great track too, with more moody organ and loud guitar making a fine backdrop to the exasperated lyrics.
B00005QIPH|5.0|I repeat THE STROKES ARE NOT THE SAVIOR OF ROCK!!  They are only a good rock band.  Maybe along with other bands they can play a part in bringing back old style rock and roll but they are not rock gods.  <br />The CD is great of course with catchy songs and good guitar work.  The band works together to make an almost 1960ish feel.  Fuzzed out vocals and simple guitar work make the CD while the lyrics are pretty basic in texture.  You can't understand why you like The Strokes, but you do.  It may seem bland but give it a couple listens and you will hear what everyone is talking about.<br />Last Nite, The Modern Age, and Is This It? are probably the best on the CD.  Each song is different but the same in texture.<br />Give The Strokes a chance and you won't be sorry.  Is This It? may be a great CD but try The White Stripes &quot;White Blood Cells&quot; to get a more varied selection of songs.

B000063T0T|4.0|I love the film I love the music... Basically I'm a huge MR fan.... still I'm nopt satisfied! I still miss a few songs, like for instance the super SmellsLikeCanCanMarmelade-medley song, the film version of Fly Away, the full version of my breathtaking favourite &quot;Roxanne Tango&quot;.... and the end version of &quot;Come What may&quot;....<BR>I know this review doesn't hold anything new.... It's basically just a wish for a third and SPECTACULAR SPECTACULAR MR soundtrack wich can make you jump infront of the mirror screaming like a fool yet again..... believe my I have already done this a lot with the two I already own....
B000002MG1|5.0|It took me a while to really like this album, but after a few plays I got hooked. Why? Well, this albums has classics like &quot;Try Not to Breathe&quot;, &quot;The Sidewinder Sleeps Tonite&quot;, &quot;Everybody Hurts&quot;, &quot;Sweetness follows&quot; (which for some reason reminds of Joni Mitchell's &quot;Both Sides Now&quot;, but is much more, well, selpulchral), &quot;Monty Got a Raw Deal&quot;, &quot;Man on the Moon&quot;- and then to cap it all, the gorgeous &quot;Nightswimming&quot; and &quot;Find the River&quot;). Also, &quot;Ignoreland&quot; is a good rockin' rant, although I can't make out all the words, &quot;Drive&quot; is a song that starts and ends quietly but builds up to powerful climaxes along the way, aided by the strings- the string arrangements, by the way, are exquisite. A lot of these songs feature organ, which I like a lot. I even got used to Peter Buck's feedback solos after a while. To me, this is the classic REM album- although in my opinion they have yet to release a bad album. This is also one of my favourite albums, period.

B00005JKJA|4.0|This is the ultimate in mind-screwing movies!  This film blew me away, and is one of the few recently released movies that I've seen that actually keeps me thinking and re-thinking every detail of the film.  The four stars are only because the dvd has no extra features to speak of, and believe me, you'll want more after viewing this movie!  Beware: Those who need nice-tidy-no-loose-end stories will not find it here. However, those with a twisted sense of adventure...
B000001EC1|4.0|Today was the best day ever!  Cause I got this cd and it had the best song in the world.  Which of course was Livin On A Prayer.  Emily also agrees with my views on that song.
B0000640SA|5.0|I'd just like to point out that this is a great movie, however the ENTIRE story isn't backwards.  The Black and White scenes are the beginning of the movie played forwards.  The Color Scenes are the End of the movie played backwards.  The actual end of the film is the middle of the story, kind of confusing, but a very original and cool concept.  It really points out what it must be like for Leonard who cannot remember past five minutes or so...<BR>Funny...I don't feel drunk.
B00003CX5P|1.0|I could not stay awake through this horrible movie.  Had to fast forward through it because there was no way I could make it through the end.  I had heard that this Jar Jar Binks character was annoying but I didn't believe he was that bad.  A totally unwatchable film.  Every actor, including Liam Neesom, Sam Jackson, and EwanMacgregor, mailed in their performance.  The sereis would have never made it if this was the first movie introduced.  Contrived and BORING!!!
B00003CXXI|5.0|Shrek is a 'fairytale' with all the traditional ingredients - a princess locked in a tower, a hero on a quest to save her, a scheming villain, true love leading to a happy (if somewhat unexpected) ending, and a supporting cast including everyone from a delightfully French Robin Hood to the gingerbread man. However, Shrek is certainly not a traditional fairytale.<br />For a start, the hero is, by his own admission, a big, smelly, ugly ogre. Secondly, this is not only a movie for kids - much of the humour will only be fully appreciated by adults. And Shrek will have *everyone* smiling, giggling and laughing out loud. All of the characters have their funny and memorable quotes and scenes, but the best lines come from Donkey (although occasionally he seems to be trying just a little too hard for comic effect).<br />The computer animation is stunning and with a just a little imagination you can see that the characters somewhat resemble the actors who provide their voices. There is definitely a bit of Eddie Murphy in Donkey anyway. It is perhaps the attention to detail that is most impressive - the facial expressions are just fabulous.<br />Shrek is a must-see film, because almost everyone will find something to like about it (although perhaps not those who like their fairy tales to be predictable and perfect). But as Princess Fiona ultimately learns, 'perfect' is an illusion and only once you accept who you are, can you live happily ever after.
B00005JKBC|1.0|The movie was above average, but the technical difficulties with the DVD were unacceptable. The captioning turns itself on many times during the movie and is so distracting that I returned the DVD. Based on other reviews, it is apparent that the problem is not isolated to my particular DVD. Considering the problems associated with this product, I'm surprised that it hasn't been pulled from the market.
B000066AXE|5.0|A Beautiful Mind was a great movie. Russell Crowe is amazing in it! Jennifer Connelly and Ed Harris are also great. It is a story about the power of love. You should buy it. RUSSELL CROWE IS HOT! BEST MOVIE OF THE YEAR!!!!
B00005KB9X|5.0|as a hardcore listner to all sorts of roots styles including the likes of Culture and Black Uhuru, im less than likely to pop in a Bob CD these days, but that doesnt matter. natty dread is, far and away, the best album i have ever heard and that isnt likely to change anytime soon.
B000002C25|4.0|\\"Be here now\\" is the album they were gonna release sooner or later.<br />Not that it's bad, it is actually very good. There are obviously some good tunes in it (\\"Stand by me\\", \\"Don't go away\\", \\"It's getting better (man) !!\\" e al.). <br />The thing is that it follows \\"What's the story...\\" and their great debut album \\"Definetely Maybe\\". With all the fuzz these releases caused, launching Oasis from Manchester to the top of the World, the next step was a tough move. How to carry on from the top? <br />Well, apart form the fact that some tracks are too long and overproduced (like the good but exagerated \\"All around the world\\"), they managed it very well, providing us a very loud and full of guitars album (the way it should always be). Rock and Roll.
B000002C1W|4.0|After Roger Waters left Pink Floyd, he thought Pink Floyd was nearing its end.  Dave Gilmour decided to take the helm, and this cd is an attempt to get back on track.  It succeeds, but not nearly as well as &quot;The Division Bell&quot;, the following cd.  <br />Nevertheless, this is good Floyd.  Dave Gilmour's guitar work is wonderful, especially on songs such as &quot;Terminal Frost&quot;, &quot;Yet Another Movie&quot;, and &quot;Sorrow&quot;.  &quot;Learning to Fly&quot;, &quot;One Slip&quot;, and &quot;On The Turning Away&quot; are catchy songs.  Missing is the wonderful orchestration of &quot;The Final Cut&quot;.<br />While this cd is mostly Dave Gilmour, if Roger Waters could do a solo Floyd record, than so could Dave Gilmour.
6302293553|4.0|This movie is extremely funny, and many people have seen it.  Often I have heard people refer to parts of it.  If you don't like or understand British comedy, this may not be the movie for you.  The only reason I gave it 4 stars is that it tends to loose its fire as it progresses and the ending is just stupid.
B00005YW4H|3.0|I was recommended this by Amazon and they are right, I do like it.  However, the comparisons to Billie and Diane strike me as odd.   First, the album is much more bluesy than jazzy.  Ms. Jones' voice sounds nothing like either, in my opinion...Finally, as nice a voice as she has, Ms. Jones' phrasing and piano don't hold a candle to Krall.
B00005LIN0|5.0|I'd give this 5 stars just for Willard White's performance!  The cast is just top notch in this American Opera (my definition, anyway) as is the supporting cast and production.  I like the fact that trained opera singers mixed with Broadway voices well and White and Baker are two well trained baritones capable of acting in the closeups.  Cynthia Haymon was a most believable Bess and no, I didn't forget Price who was wonderful.  Her version wasn't filmed that I know of.  Price's CD also is recommended.  Regarding this video,I agree with the assessments of other reviewers as to the merits of this cast and production and HIGHLY RECOMMEND this DVD version.
B00005QZWI|5.0|THis is a marvelous soundtrack. Moody and evocative, it immerses me in its imagery and I can see the movie unfolding before me as it plays. And while Enya is talented, she is overrated. In fact, Elizabeth Fraser is a major talent that contributes vocals to Lothlorien and nobody ever mentions her in their reviews. The former vocalist from the Cocteau Twins is perfectly suited to film scores and her &quot;magical and mystical&quot; voice adds a lot here. In addition, a boy named Edward Ross sings on The Breaking of the Fellowship and he is wonderful.<br />The entire CD is good from start to finish. Enjoy it for Enya, but please remember the little guys. They do more than pull their weight here.
B00003CX5P|3.0|The movie itself was actually pretty good, but when held to the same standards as the original three Star Wars movies it lacked the same oomph.  Lucas himself, admitted that he was a little rusty in the Star Wars universe and it showed in some of the choices for the movie.  Jar-Jar Binks.  That said it is still a decent movie and a definite must buy, if only to eventually own all of the series.
B00005JL3A|4.0|I would rate the video game movies like this:<br />1- Resident Evil <BR>2- Mortal Kombat<BR>3- Final Fantasy<BR>4- Tomb Raider<BR>5- Mortal Kombat: Anilation<BR>6- Double Dragon<BR>7- Street Fighter<br />The history of video game movies has been rocky, but this one restores my faith in the genre. I saw it twice in the theatre, and I will be watching it a infinite amount of times on DVD. Something I did not like about it was the lack of gore. That is something Resident Evil [the game] had been known for. But it did not disappoint me as much as other games to movie adaptations. It starts out with a fatal mistake of a virus being unleashed in a place called The Hive. A computer then kills everyone in the building. A elite team of soldiers has been sent to clean up the mess. It's ending leaves it wide open for a sequel, which I really REALLY want to see. Mill Jovovich gives a great performance in the movie along with the other actors. This is a good movie and you will most likely enjoy it.
B00004XONN|5.0|Sonic landscapes. Twisted nightmares. This album is a trip to the wildside. Slabs of distortion colide with techno beats. And over it all Thom Yorke's voice croons. True it is not a album for everyone. But if you want a truly different musical experience, well. Then put this on. Push play. And let the music take you.
6305013578|5.0|There will never be another film like Metropolis. It paved the way for 2001: A Space Odyssey and Star Wars with the scene where they change a robot into a human. I will now review this film in this way:<br />The Film:<br />5\5 Stars<br />This the best science fiction film of all time and the greatest silent film of all time. I can't imagine that any science fiction film would have been made if Metropolis had not been made. The beauty of this film is the set design and SFX. It pushed the limits back in a time where this could never be imagined. The story also paved the way for the game Red Faction and the film Total Recall. It is about a future where slave miners work underground. A son of a leader of Metropolis finds out about the terrible conditions of the slaves. This is a film for everyone... but beware:<br />The DVD:<br />Must Be Destroyed By Nuclear Bombs<br />This is down right terrible. I can't believe they would treat this film this way. The picture quality, the audio quality, even the cover art is terrible.<br />If you have never seen Metropolis before, love the film, or want to have a collection of the history of film, get this. It is cheap and is one of the greatest motion pictures ever created.
B00005UEAR|5.0|Dream Theater are, without a doubt, a band full of the most artistic artists out there today.  Hearing their music at its finest gives you an unexplainable sense of joy, not because the music is so catchy, or so artistic, (although it is certainly these things as well) but because it is encouraging to hear that there is a band of this caliber still around today.  Each member is a practical virtuoso at his respective instrument, able to do things most other musicians today could never even &quot;dream&quot; about.  It's kind of like lumping five divas together and watching them all work their magic at the same time without leaving a single person out of the spotlight.  When a band as talented as this can manage to not only make incredible and complex music like this, but to do it together, as a TEAM, well it's damn inspiring.<br />Take, for example, the phenomenal opening track of this album, &quot;The Glass Prison,&quot; a myriad of puzzling guitar riffs, intricate bass lines, and dynamic keyboard melodies accompanied by some truly devastating drumming.  Backing it all up (or fronting, technically) is the beautiful voice of vocalist James Labrie, adding the final dimension to Dream Theater's unique sound.  There is nary a dull minute (out of the 13!) to be had here, with each member recieving their own chance to shine, and I mean REALLY shine.  Without a doubt, Dream Theater's heaviest song, but trust me, they make it work.<br />You then encounter the beautiful, ballad-ish &quot;Blind Faith,&quot; which tends to slow things down a bit, but as a song on this album, contributes all the more to the beautiful atmosphere.  &quot;Missunderstood&quot; is a song you may need to allow yourself some time to work with, but the effort is a rewarding one as it is just as satisfying as any other song on this album.  Not only that, but it really picks up steam at the end.  The final epic song, &quot;The Great Debate,&quot; resembles the work of the band Tool in both sound and style, with emotional, intelligent, and thought-provoking lyrics.  It's definitely one of the more creative songs on the album, where it gets double praise from me for being a good song AND a salute to Dream Theater for attempting something different.  The final song of disk one &quot;Disappear&quot; is a worthy track overall and a solid closer to the first half of the album.<br />We are then treated to the second disk, and what I believe is one of Dream Theater's most ambitious and creative efforts: the title track to the album, Six Degrees of Inner Turbulence.  This is the longest song they have ever done since &quot;A Change of Seasons&quot;, which still today remains a fan favorite (and only half as long!).  And, while I can safely say that creating an engaging an enjoyable 46 minute song is something only the members of Dream Theater could do, it also must be said that, as a complete &quot;song,&quot; 6DOIT doesn't precisely feel like the real deal.  The song is broken up into 8 separate tracks and, while each is an enjoyable listen, none, save for 1 or 2, posses any common theme or link to them (musically of course, not lyrically) to qualify it as an actual full-blown 46 minute song.  It seems to more closely resemble somewhat of a concept album of separate songs which happen to flow easily into and out of one another.  <br />Do not take this as a sign that I am bashing this song in any way, for I am not, it just seems bizarre for a band to label something as a 46 minute song, where it is really in fact 8 separate, 6 minute tracks, which don't really possess any semblance of one full song, linked by the common theme of mental disease.  It is, no doubt, as worthy an effort from Dream Theater as ever, and, as I said before, quite breathtaking to listen to, just simply not deserving the title of a complete song.<br />Nevertheless, as my title reads, I believe Dream Theater to be one of the prominent bands of this decade, and in my eyes they only seem to be getting better.  While they did indeed surpass any and all expectations as artists in their 1999 offering &quot;Metropolis Pt. 2: Scenes From a Memory,&quot; they somehow continue to evolve as musicians and they're immeasurable talent in songwriting and depth continues to improve with each new album.  In short: they won't be able to put out a new album soon enough for me.
B00003CX9E|5.0|This is the greatest written screenplay of all time and one of the best films of all time. It has amazing character devlopment has we go through Charles Kane's life and try to figure out what is rosebud. Orson Welles gives a amazing perfromance a Charlie Kane, a newspaper giant who tries to live a full life, but fails. This is definatly not the best film of all time (that belongs to Casablanca), but one of the best. The DVD provides insite into the controversial fight between Orson Welles and William Randolph Hearst, who believed they made a mockery of his life. This is a film for everybody and should be the film that all filmmakers see.
B00004Z459|1.0|This band, while solid, is nothing special.  They take the overdone formula of rock-rap and streamline it, but add nothing to it.  <br />The lead singer sounds like an angry reject from a boy band.  He can sing well, but sounds too high pitched and nasily to be anything but whiney.  The rapper is solid, yet nothing special.  <br />Lyrically, Linkin Park aims at the lowest common denominator by whining about relationships.  It's nothing new, and has been done better by other bands (early Tool, The Cure, Stabbing Westward, and others).<br />Musically, it's power chords for the chorus, unoriginal hip-hop for the verses.  They know that, for the most part, playing it safe ensures good record sales, so they play it incredibly safe.  Everything's trinary (AABA), and everything's formulaic.  The songs grow loud when expected, quiet when expected...it's paint-by-numbers.<br />Linkin Park isn't horrible.  They're just typical of the way mainstream rock has become.  Catchy, simple, but adding nothing to the art.  The fact that they won the Grammy for Best Metal Album does not bode well for the genre.  It was a notice to the world that rock is on life support.
B00003CXA3|3.0|The French Connection has a great plot, but the car chase is very weak. The French Connection is about a cop, wonderfully played by Gene Hackman, who teams up with a french cop to take down a drug cartel. It has a very good plot that paved the way for one of the best drug related films Traffic and the miniseries Traffik. However, I believe A Clockwork Orange deserved that award. Rent this first, don't expect much from the car chase. Then if you like it, buy it.
B00001NFCY|2.0|Now I've been told by friends that Creed's songs sound a lot alike, but i never trust my friend's opinions. UNFORTUNATELY, i think I'd have to agree this time... particularly since their hits sound a lot alike and I wouldn't have to buy the CD to figure that out (I did anyway...) They're not exactly what I'd classify as &quot;hard rock&quot; either... it seems they're just one of many bands with throaty vocals that's popping up in the pop music limelight lately. The CD ain't the greatest I've heard ever, but it ain't the worst either. The real test of how great they are (or not) is if they survive the next five to ten years- and if their music keeps evolving... the mark of any good band is the sound doesn't remain stagnant and changes with the times... and from similarity of songs on their two CD's out, I'm seriously wondering if they will survive...
0743216458|3.0|Stephen Ambrose provides yet another readable and enjoyable book with &quot;Band of Brothers&quot;.  Certainly not his best work (Citizen Soldiers and D-Day are much better), but he does, in my humble (maybe &quot;uneducated&quot;) opinion do the men of E Company, 101st Airborne justice with this snippet of their time spend training, fighting and post war living.  This relatively short (some 300ish pages) book is an easy read that one can get through quickly.  Yet, unlike Citizen Soldier, which I had a hard time putting down, Band of Brothers is easier to walk away from and then come back to - although I must stress that I always came back to it.  Many of the accounts in Band of Brothers are just too brief and leave the reader thirsting for more.  In the end though I was not so much disappointed with the book as I was wishing there had been more to digest and think about.  If this is the first Ambrose book you read, don't be discouraged from reading others of his - he is a great author, Band of Brothers is solid but not his best.
1559946377|4.0|A Clockwork Orange is a dramatic story tracing the footsteps of a young misguided product of social disaster.  From the first page, the reader is overcome by Burgess' unique &quot;Nadsat&quot;, meaning teenager, talk.  Once you begin to pick up the new words, the book opens into a cruel yet strangley familiar world.  I would recommend this book to anyone who likes to ask questions and look for deeper meaning.  Yet, this was not a book for the weak hearted, because there is violence.
0805047905|5.0|I received this book at my baby shower.  I couldn't wait to start reading it to my baby.  She looked at all the pages and would follow the bright pictures as soon as she could focus.  The book is easy to read and creates such a nice rythym.  The pictures are colorful with wonderful contrast that really catches babies eye.  The book is sturdy for when your child starts to grab and taste everything.
0812550706|5.0|Ender's Game, By Orson Scott Card, is a bestseller!  The book Ender's Game is a complex science fiction book for the enthusiastic reader.  I am not an enthusiastic reader.  Within 10 pages Card hooked me with his book.  While most people believe that this book is amazing, i believe it is stupendous.  Ender is a genius boy with a genius family at age 8.  He off to battle school where he prepare to fight a battle against a race of bugs that will attack Earth in a third invasion. The book brings added depth to warfare in that it puts a 3-dimentional view of the battlefield just like an airplace dogfight.  As the story progresses the level of action, interest, and mystery continues to grow.  I couldn't put this book down. The book ends in a thrilling climactic way and questions. It questions our very grip on reality and helps us define who we are as a people and as a species.
0590447254|5.0|I love this book.  It is so much fun to read to my daughter.  She laughs all through out the book.  We love to look at the pictures and name the animals before the book does.  The pictures are cute.  The story is fun.
B00005JKJA|5.0|In my opinion, Mulholland Drive was by far the best movie of 2001.  I think that in some of his other films, David Lynch just gave up at some point and released his grip on reality and even coherence.  What sometimes resulted (and I'm thinking here of movies like Lost Highway) were some fascinating mind trips that didn't really hold up to intense critical scrunity.  Mulholland Drive is different.  There's no way to explicate the mysteries of the movie in this short review, but I think that persistent and thoughtful viewers will find Mulholland Drive to be a brilliant exploration of a troubled mind as well as a blistering criticism of Hollywood and the movie industry.  The movie is by no means simple or easily accessible, but it is definitely worth repeated viewings and long discussions with good friends--I don't think that a single, solitary viewing will do it justice.
0694003611|5.0|I received this book as a shower gift.  I thought it was going to be forever before I got any use out of it.  I was told that it is good to read to your baby even when they are really tiny, so I did.  I would set my daughter in my lap and read to her.  She start following the bright pages as soon as she could focus.  She loves to look at the pages and she is now starting to laugh at different pictures on the pages.  We look for the mouse all the time.  This is a great book and it will continue to get much use for many years, I can tell.  I am glad it is a good sturdy book.
038533558X|5.0|I don't know how it is possible, but Harlan Coben just keeps getting better.  Fresh off the heals of one of the best suspense mysteries of the year with TELL NO ONE, Coben kicks it up a notch with another smash hit.<br />GONE FOR GOOD will have you flipping pages faster than sailors on shore leave.  It is the story of Will Klein, a man who's first love was brutally murdered supposedly by his own brother who has been in hiding for eleven years.  After his mother's death, he is led to believe that his brother is in fact innocent of the crime and is still alive.  To confuse him more, the woman he is planning to marry disappears, leaving behind a trail of clues that make her the person she was not believed to be.<br />This mystery has a plethora of plot twists that will keep you guessing and then second-guessing once you think you know what is going on.  Coben creates a wonderful atmosphere with intricately diverse characters, each having his or her own story leading in a different direction, but he ties them up nicely throughout the book.  This book has slightly more humor (not as much as the amazing Myron Bolitar series), which peppers the flow of the novel quite well.<br />As in all Coben books, the dialogue makes the story, and that is no different here.  Whether it is the witty banter between Squares and Will, or the laying-it-all-on-the-line passionate heartfelt emotion, you can't help but be intrigued by this book.  With the edge of you seat suspense, thrilling mystery, good vs. evil, and passion-filled romance, this book truly has it all.  GONE FOR GOOD is one wild ride!
B00001NFCY|5.0|It's great. I feel it's considerably better than their new release \\"Weathered\\" in which the lyrics strike me as mostly garage band generic (sometimes they don't even make sense) and the adrenaline from the previous albums seems to have finally burned off.<br />But this, THIS, my friend, is worth getting. EVERY song is good or great and the guitar player has apparently been eating his Wheaties because he is ALL OVER IT!!!
B0000024SD|5.0|I first listened to this album on my Dad's old vinyl copy on my cheap little record player when I was about 14. Not surpisingly, I didn't get it at frst. But, with a little more maturity (and I still don't have much in that area) the album started to make sense. Even before I understood any of the album, I could feel that it was good. Pretty soon it all made sense to me. Dylan's ideas are so brilliant that you can't help but adopt them. I was brainwashed by this album. It's so good, I think of a line from this album everyday for one reason or another. It's a key part of my life, along, obviously, with the rest of Bob's work. This album is worth buying simply for the musicianship, and on top of that is Dylan's lyrics. You can't go wrong with the album. It establishes itself as a great album just by its liner notes. <BR>\\"statues made of matchsticks<BR>crumble into one another<BR>my love winks, she does not bother<BR>she knows too much to argue or top judge\\"<BR>                         -Love Minus Zero / No Limit<BR>People say that Dylan is indecipharable. I disagree. That quote is simple direct, beautiful and meaningful. and just picked it off the top of my head. The whole album's that good. Every line is perfect. I consider this the best album ever.
B00003CXXP|4.0|I'm not going to write much about the movie, I find it is a very good one, an interesting view of a future that really could happen (the poles melt, strict birth control, more dependence on machines, etc.) and very good acting from both Osment and Law.<br />What made me write this commentary is the DVD edition. I am completely dissapointed with it and find unbelievable that Steven Spielberg let it go into the market. Just look at the video quality, it looks like a good VHS. The extras are good and with better video quality than the movie itself!
B000060P79|5.0|Hey! Everyone go out and buy Simple Plan's new album...it's awesome for any punk fan. Each and every song on it is great!
B000002B7S|4.0|Well, I know many of you guys out there may not like my review of the \\"Ultimate Sin\\". But allow me the right to differ from your tastes! Yes, I said that \\"The ultimate\\" was Ozzy's worst record, and I stick by my review, but on the other hand, \\"Bark at the Moon\\" simply rocks! As far as i'm concerned, this is Ozzy 3erd best (studio) album, only behind \\"Blizzard\\" and \\"Diary\\".<br /><br />As you may know by now, i am a huge Randy Rhoads fan (by the way, check the spelling on that, guys), but I really believe Ozzy nailed it with this! The record has a somewhat more melancolic vibe than its predecessors (and also the following records), and not without a reason: this is how Ozzy dealt with the death of his friend and partner. You can easely tell that most songs are inspired by Randy, and some of them even sound as (possible?) leftovers from unfinished writing sessions with Randy. I realize this is unlikely, but sometimes I like to think so...<br /><br />Jake E. Lee? Yes, he is not Randy, but c'mon? What would you expect? He does a remarkable job, and even if the liner notes say that Ozzy wrote all the songs, we all know better than that! C'mon, Ozzy does't play any instruments, how in heaven's name is he supposed to come up with the riffs from \\"Bark at the moon\\" (the song), if not with the help of a great guitar player? The only song I don't like so much is \\"Center of Eternity\\". I don't know why, really, but it's not a bad song either.<br /><br />But \\"So tired\\" is unbelievable, \\"Slow down\\" rips, the title song still rocks 19 years after it was recorded, \\"R n'R rebel\\" is funky and cool, and the other 2 slow numbers, \\"Now you see me, now you don't\\" and \\"You're no different\\" are muddy but intense songs. If you liked \\"Blizzard\\" and \\"Diary\\", you should like this one. In fact, i like it even better than \\"No more tears\\", another great Ozzy album, simply because it lacks the commercial feel that some of the material on \\"Tears\\" has. Don't get me wrong, I love that record too, but I feel closer (for whatever reason) to Ozzy's earliest and somewhat more obscure material (and no, I don't go out at night to quench my thirst of blood with young ladies... I'm no vampire!)<br /><br />Oh, yeah! Before I forget: my favorite Ozz record is \\"Tribute\\", and you should get that one too! Bottom line: get all Ozzy records but \\"The ultimate sin\\".

B000003489|5.0|It's understandable that many listeners may prefer to \\"Giant Steps\\" the more accessible earlier or later Trane. The former offers up his explorations within more familiar song forms; the latter makes the song secondary to the soloist's quest for a rapture beyond musical form altogether. \\"Giant Steps,\\" on the other hand, is a musican's album. It set a new standard not only for saxophonists but all musicians, requiring a combination of harmonic knowledge and technical facility that sent numerous musicians back to the woodshed for countless hours of practice. Without this album, and especially the title song and \\"The Countdown,\\" Coltrane's early work would have seemed short of realizing its potential, and his later work would have been open to increasing suspicion about his actual credentials. Like Armstrong's cadenza on \\"West End Blues\\" and Bird's break on \\"Night in Tunisia,\\" \\"Giant Steps\\" turned heads and gave a generation of musicians a whole new understanding of what jazz improvisation was capable of producing.<br />For the more technically minded, Trane's revision of dominant-tonic harmony is more impressive than his later embracing of modes as the sole platform for his scales and upper register probings. Suggested by the challenging bridge of Rodgers and Hart's \\"Have You Met Miss Jones,\\" the sequence moves through a cycle of descending major thirds which, in the hands of most musicians, feels awkward and unnatural. Coltrane not only mastered the sequence but learned how to use it as a substitution in conventional harmonic settings. More impressively, he learned to execute it with an agility and naturalness that makes it possible for the listener to ignore the harmonic underpinning entirely and be swept up by the wave of emotion and melodic inventiveness.<br />\\"Giant Steps\\" is the main reason Sonny Rollins temporarily stopped playing in public. To his credit he came up with his own solution to the tyrannous sameness of much pop song harmony, but he was never able to come to terms with the harmonic complexity and technical innovations introduced by Coltrane. On the other hand, few have.to come to terms with the harmonic complexity and technical innovations introduced by Coltrane. On the other hand, few have.

B00000JPHF|1.0|I can't believe this movie gets a rating of 5 stars!! Honestly I think this movie is silly, ridiculous, badly acted, and a waste of time. Now I do know this was made long ago, and so I understand that back then they didn't do movies as well, but still I think there was lots of room for improvement in this movie. The plot was so shallow and undeveloped and disjointed. The actors, for the most part sounded like schoolchildren do;just reciting lines with no realness or emotion behind it. Though Henry Frankenstein at times did convince me he was a lunatic. The monster was ugly, yes, but I didn't find him very good, all he did was go around growling. You never got to understand what he was like as a character and what exactly he wanted in life. I am not trying to upset anyone, but again I say this movie was a waste of time and was quite laughable throughout. I am 39 years old and I believe this is the first time I have seen this, though I may have seen it when I was a young child. I would never spend money on buying this film. Just borrowed it from the library.<br /> This was counted as one of America's top 100 movies???WHY??? I recommend it only as an example of deplorable movie making that for some reason has survived because of it's campy-ness or because of media hype.

B00000DGUG|5.0|This is the transistion between Alanis' first enraged album and her latest &quot;Under Rug Swept.&quot;  Needless to say, she did an amazing job and as usual captured the essence of those emotions that most of us struggle with everyday.
B000002UAI|4.0|After spending most of 1964 touring, making a movie (and recording its magnificent soundtrack), and touring some more, the Beatles probably should have taken a well-earned break. Instead they headed straight back to the studio to record BEATLES FOR SALE. This is one of the more curious Beatle albums in that it finds the band taking some steps backward, but also some steps forward. <br />The most obvious step backwards is the inclusion of 6 cover versions (after the all-original HARD DAY'S NIGHT), most of which do not compare favorably with the covers on the first two records. Also, some of the originals, especially \\"Every Little Thing\\" and \\"What You're Doing\\" are not really up to the standards set on A HARD DAY'S NIGHT. <br />At the same time, the best originals on the album find the Beatles beginning to explore uncharted territory. Lennon sounds marvelously jaded and morose on the three tracks which open the album (\\"No Reply\\", \\"I'm a Loser\\", and \\"Baby's in Black\\") as well as on \\"I Don't Want to Spoil the Party\\". \\"I'll Follow the Sun\\" introduces us to McCartney's folkier side. And, of course \\"Eight Days a Week\\" is fantastic. The Beatles must have felt like they were working eight days a week.<br />So, the over-all assessment has to be that, although it is not one of the Beatle masterpieces, BEATLES FOR SALE is still a very solid record.
B0000636UN|5.0|The California sound has long been dormant. Once vibrant with the likes of the Eagles, The Byrds, and Tom Petty &amp; the Heartbreakers, California Rock once dominated the airwaves and charts. Much to my chagrin, the &quot;LA sound&quot; had all but vanished.<br />That is until, Sheryl Crow's C'mon C'mon.<br />From the opening strains to the closing fade, Sheryl has constructed front to back the best California Rock album in a decade. From her lyrics you can tell Sheryl has done a lot of living, loving and losing over the 3 years it took to create this album.<br />From the poignantly touching  &quot;It's Only Love&quot; to the tortured &quot;Weather Channel&quot;, Crow weaves personal experience and observations into a rich and compeling brew, evoking Tom Petty-like sounds without the songs sounding like retreads. Turn to tracks such as  &quot;You're an Original&quot; or &quot;Hole In my Pocket&quot; and you can hear the faint strains of the Eagles' &quot;Long Run&quot; sound bubbling in the background. Sheryl manages to bring country rock full circle with classically twangy, jangly cuts &quot;Abeline&quot; and the title track, &quot;C'mon C'mon&quot;. <br />Crow also shows that the harder edge rock she explored on her second album &quot;Sheryl Crow&quot;, wasn't a phase by including the raucous tunes &quot;Steve McQueen&quot; and &quot;Lucky Kid&quot;. Spreading her wings lyrically and musically, Crow cast a wide net to capture some of Rock and Roll's best talent to accompany her on this album. Read the liner notes and you'll find heavyweights Stevie Nicks and Don Henley among them. You'll also clearly hear the vocal talents of Lenny Kravitz and Natlie Maines lending their voices to Sheryl's diverse chorus.<br />Without question, the song of the album is &quot;Diamond Road&quot;. A plaintive plea to those wounded souls to never give up. Sheryl sings, &quot;So don't miss the diamonds along the way/Every road has led us here today/Life is what happens when you're making plans/All that you need is right here in your hands.&quot; Sheryl is telling us, &quot;I've been there, it's hard, but you'll get through it&quot;.<br />Do yourself a favor, don't miss this gem of an album. Like the diamonds Crow alludes to, this CD is brilliant, flawless, and timeless. California Rock has a new torch bearer and her name is Sheryl Crow.
B00005YUPO|5.0|I have a 5 month old who loves watching these videos.  It is as much fun for me to watch him react to the pictures as I think it is for him to watch them.  I would definately recommend this product. (Baby Mozart and Einstein too!!)
B000053VAF|5.0|Forget how funny this movie is. Forget about all the great actors and actresses in it, and forget how much controversy this movie caused. Forget the abominable abundance of the f-word, and forget that one of the characters is made of feces.<br />Do not forget this, however: Most popular religions today started with a bunch of good ideas. One time, this African had some great ideas about how his kindred could get along, and WE the people deemed him a prophet, almost supernatural. Started naming ourselves Muhammad, or Mohammed, or whatever, to honor him.<br />Another time, this Jew who spoke Aramaic had some good ideas about how his kindred could get along. WE the people first embraced him, then killed him, then declared him immortal so that killing him wasn't such a bad thing after all. Started naming our kids Joshua, or Jesus, or whatever, to honor him. <br />Wanna hear the best part? Now we're fighting each other (we meaning humans) in the Mideast because some man-made religious landmarks happen to overlap in the same city. Am I oversimplifying things?<br />So \\"Dogma\\" reminds us that an end-of-the-world event like the plenary indulgence of two fallen angels (or maybe world war III in the fertile crescent) would be brought on by...yep- We the people. Why? Because we set up a million and three rules (some of which are contradictory) and called them Catholicism, or Buddhism, or whatever, when all we need are a few GOOD IDEAS!!!!<br />Wanna hear something else funny? The phrase 'plenary indulgence' wasn't around until 1600 years after Jesus died. Know what else? Jesus didn't found Christianity. We did.<br />In this movie we have what? A Latin muse who's a stripper. An African disciple ignored in a European Bible. A Catholic martyr who works in an abortion clinic. And some white boys, the most  derelict of which were labeled prophets! What do they have in common? A Jew named Jesus? Not quite. Just a few good ideas. <br />And in the end, it's all a movie, right?
B000002LCI|4.0|...little treasure.  This record fills the gap between Black Celebration and Violator.  A little more commercial than Black Celebration but not as commercial as Violator.  Music for the Masses contains a massive assortment of samples, more than any other DM album it seems.  Strangelove being the dance hit single, while other tracks like things you said, and Pimpf are geared towards the more traditional Depeche Mode fan.  A good record for the depeche mode fan and beginner.
B000060OFT|5.0|Hollywood is running out of original stories. All we see now are the same movies over and over again. Baz Luhrmann has impressed me with two of his films, Moulin Rouge and Romeo + Juliet. These are both original films in terms of ideas and style. I like this film because it's like I know the whole thing, but I'm seeing it for the first time. All the acting is great, the look of the film is interesting and deep, and the whole project was thrown together very impressively by Mr. Luhrmann and his crew. All together a very spiffy job and a truly origianl and compelling movie. I would recommend seeing it even if u hate Shakespeare.
B000002GYI|5.0|Kraftwerk classic record!  These guys were truly ahead of their time, it's almost scary that everything in this record is even more relevant today than at the time of recording.  The purpose of this album was to show how computers and technology have pervaded our lives and such, nestled with kraftwerk's industrial techo-pop style.  Layered synths, samples and drum machines, and the standard Kraftwerk synthetic robot voices take over the album.  At times minimalistic, but ambient throughout.
B00000I5Y6|5.0|What exactly does that mean?  And whatever that is, it must KICK [BUTT] because bands like Kansas, Styx, Foreigner, etc. rock! They are the reasons why I like classic rock... and the reasons why many others like classic rock.  Um, that's the reason why they are played so much on classic rock stations... because people like them.  And why would you (Bobby Clark) say they are for the mindless?  I find the lyrics of many of the songs to be rather enlightening and unoffensive and thoughtful, and that goes along with beats/rhythms/etc. that rock!<br />Hey, I like the Ramones and the Clash too though.
B00003CXXP|5.0|I can't understand why some people don't like this film.  A.I. has it all!  Excellent acting, superb storyline, beautiful photography, cutting-edge special effects.  In addition, it makes you think and feel.  Questions are raised which easily give rise to intriguing philosophical discussions.  What makes us human?  What is the extent of our responsiblity to the world around us?  A.I. has been added to my very short list of &quot;best films of all time&quot;.  My thanks to Stanley Kubrick who had the vision and to Steven Spielberg who implemented it!
B00005JKCF|5.0|Spider-Man exceeded all my expectations for any summer movie!  This is an exciting action thrill ride with high-flying action, drama, and suspense.  Tobey Maguire was perfectly cast as the role of Peter Parker, and he did a fabulous job.  I also liked Kirsten Dunst's role as Mary Jane.  Everyone did a great job!  Cannot say it enough--GO SEE THIS MOVIE!!!!!!!!!!!!!<BR>Oh, I almost forgot about that other so-called blockbuster called Star Wars Episode II.......well, I can give you a one-word review for that movie:  FUGGEDABOUTIT!!!!!!!!!!!!
B000001OAA|5.0|I love this album to death,it rules!!! I love their sound it is their own. If you love the 80's you will like this album. I like her voice alot. I put this album up with any. Its their best album to me.
0786915749|2.0|Frankly I don't understand the incredibly high rating this book has received. In 20+ years of reading fantasy I've never seen something with so many problems be so well received.<br />   The protagonists I found very lacking and unlikeable. The kender should have been fed to the nearest red dragon right off and the series would have improved. Tanis has the personality and depth of mashed potatoes and the only character of any substance, the admired Raistlin is merely a whiny adolescent boy. Sturm should have been called Stern, his obvious alliterative inspiration as he never gets beyond being the Stern knight. The dwarf is a caricature.<BR> <BR>   Strangely enough, the text of the book seems to be designed merely to flesh out happenings between game modules that may or may not be available to play. The second book of the series has the heroes just leaving what sounded like an interesting dungeon adventure. Unfortunately to experience that I guess you have to buy the module and play it. I find it very poor taste to have an epic fantasy series designed to drive the sale of game modules. The work should stand on it's own, and this one does not.<br />    The actual story is nothing new in any respect and with unlikeable characters reading it is a chore. We are given no reason to care about the fate of Krynn, or any of the characters. The world is presented with a veneer of depth, however there is nothing beneath the veneer. Interesting and varied names for many different factions may at first glance appear to give the illusion of complexity, but you quickly realize there is nothing really there beyond the illusion. In fact I ended up rooting against the buffoons portrayed as heroes. To rub salt into the wounds, the end of the trilogy is basically a deus ex machina of the poorest sort. I've read it twice, because it is so popular, trying to see if I am missing something. I came to the conclusion I'm not, or reading it originally at 25 I was too old for it and the literature I had read before had ruined this for me.<br />   I know my reviewer rating will get slammed for this, but it is my honest opinion that this series is complete and utterly mediocre. Without a TSR/WOTC gameworld it would have been unpublishable.<br />    There is actually some readable franchise fiction, so I'm not slamming it due to the source. I like Elaine Cunningham and Rob Salvatore, both workhorses in the TSR/WOTC stable. This trilogy is just rent paying hackwork though.
B00004Z459|5.0|I think this is the best CD I have ever listend too.  I recomend this CD to anyone who likes good Rock Music but not just senseless screaming.  Linkin Park is my favorite band.  I think you would like them too
0060934913|5.0|Are you socially incorrigible, substance-dependent, able to curse fluently in multiple Spanish dialects, have a high tolerance for knife wounds, burns, cramped spaces, no sleep, and people looking to stab you in the back at every turn? Well, if you are, and you're not interested in a career in piracy in Latin America, you might want to try being a fancy chef.<br />Anthony Bourdain's \\"Kitchen Confidential\\" is a salty, rambling, rambunctious love letter to the world of a professional chef and to the insane people who inhabit it, interspersed with some advice to the general public (such as why you should never order your steak well-done or a fish frittata, and how many knives you REALLY need to make all those hoity-toity dishes you see on TV). Bourdain gleefully jumps from describing his falling in love with french cuisine as a boy, to his experience as a junior \\"know-nothing\\" in Cape Cod, to what a typical day at Les Halles is, to a full-blown food and alcohol orgy in Japan, all at a pace that will leave you gasping for breath.<br />Not necessarily for the faint-hearted, but if you want to know what life is like behind your fancy dishes, this is a must-read.
B000059QY3|5.0|This great opera written by Verdi in 1853 was based on Alexandre Dumas La Damme aux camelias. Traviata's first performance was at Venice's Gran Teatro La Fenice on March 6th 1853. Operas presented in  film versions do not represent the true meaning of this genre. This version is a stage production!!<BR>The Covent Garden performance of Traviata with Sir Georg Solti conducting The Royal Opera Chorus and Orchestra is captured in digital 5.1 channels which completly fills the room with the most beautiful arias. The dance of the &quot;bullfighters&quot; ( second act) at Traviata's party in Paris is a major choreographic extravaganza and plays an important role in the opera. <BR>Unfortunaly, this version down plays it significantly. Overall, this production is magnificent with excellent performances by Angela Gheorghiu as Violetta. If operas were included in the Oscars, Ms. Gheorghiu would de a clear winner. If you are an opera lover, this is a must item in your library.
0553801481|5.0|I really enjoyed this book, but then, I really enjoyed the Assasin trilogy as well. I suspect that readers who have previously read that trilogy will get the most out of this new series which continues the story of that same suite of characters. I love it when you get to find out the rest of the story- the &quot;whatever happened to...&quot; bits. I do feel that the Assasin trilogy finished things fairly neatly- you had your crisis and your climactic resolution and all that. So, in this trilogy, we get a whole new set of crises to read about. What fun! ;) So it's not that there were unresolved issues left dangling after Assasin's Quest- it's just that in my experience, you'll really care what is going on the lives of these characters if you already know the story that came before. The whys and hows and whats.
B00003CXXP|2.0|This is one very, very, frustrating film.  Swinging between dark to the point of gruesome and cloyingly syrupy, it is both fascinating and dead boring, worth watching, and a total waste of time.<BR>Firstly, Spielberg spends about 50 minutes setting the scene, introducing us both to the earth as it is now and to the family, particularly the mother Monica, (Frances O'Connor) who takes in the robot boy David.  These scenes occasionally drag, but since you assume they're going to set up the main story and make it more effective, you put up with them.  Then there's a good hour and a half of David running around in search of mommy, who has abandonned him, meeting up with Jude Law as a robot prostitute, and surviving various traumatic experiences...and then the movie just keeps going, on and on and on.  After a while, all tension and suspense dissipates, and it becomes schmaltzy and slow and well, robotic.  And then there are a bunch of aliens, and a fairy, and so on and so on.<BR>Its not so much disjointed as unfocused.  It resembles Kubricks Space Odyssey in that individual shots go on forever.  It resembles E.T in that you can't quite stop caring, even though you begin to hate everyone and get bored.<BR>The parts that work the best, in fact the only parts that work, are those scenes with Jude Law.  Although he's in about and hour of the film it feels far to short.  He portrays the robot with feelings even though he's not programmed to have them much more effectively than Haley Joel Osment, who really cannot carry this much material.  It's Gigolo Joe who is the one really remarkable character, and maybe Teddy<BR>As for the rest......aaaarrrrgggghhh.
B00005JKCF|4.0|This was an excellent movie.  The plot is, on a class field trip, teenaged scientist Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) is bitten by a radioactive spider.  Over night, his vision improves greatly (so he doesn't need glasses) and all of a sudden he has bulging muscles and super-strength.  After a little mishap at school, Peter Parker discovers that he can now crawl on walls, jump really high and far, and shoot webs from his hands.  He decides to suit up and become Spider-Man.  Also, I must also give Sam Raimi credit on the intriguing design of the Green Goblin, compaired to what the Goblin looks like the comics.  I also thought Spider-Man's outfit looked really neat, and so did the Goblin's.  Now, by reading this, you'd be wondering why I gave it only four starts, because the way I discribe it, it sounds like just my type of movie, right?  Well, that is true, but sadly, half the special effects could be easily identified, due to the fact that they moved kind of fast and almost looked like Sam Raimi just clipped 'em out of a video game and plastered 'em into the movie.  But, other than that, this was a definate must-see!  Even if you're new to Spider-Man and haven't read the comics, this movie will lay down all the facts for you.  Enjoy!
B00003CXS4|5.0|To put this cinematic masterpiece into some perspective, let me first give a brief description of what I thought of it:<br />...you can quote me...<br />Okay, &quot;holy hell, that was the funniest movie I've seen in at least five years.&quot;<br />easily one of the greatest movies I have seen, it's just plain funny in every way. I really don't need to say any more. Just this:<br />&quot;well, it came from a funny angle!&quot;<BR>&quot;Tyrone, when you back up, things come from BEHIND YOU!&quot;
0553275976|5.0|One often hears people describe this book as &quot;the definitive novel of the Eighties,&quot; and I expected it to seem as much when I began reading it in 2002.  What I found was that nothing could be further from the truth.  In fact, much like &quot;A Man In Full,&quot; which I read immediately afterwards, this novel is simply about Americans.  But unlike other popular American writers (e.g., Tom Clancy), Wolfe treats his characters as human beings with flaws, and no more control over their own destinies than the vast majority of the people of the rest of the world.  I think what Wolfe is ultimately getting at is the &quot;arbitrariness of fate.&quot;  Americans, as the last products of Western civilization, are conditioned largely to believe that if they only do certain things a certain way in life and make themselves believe in this way of doing things, they can exercise control over their futures.  As such, Americans more than any other people tend to live &quot;in the future.&quot;  Yet, as Wolfe so eloquently shows, myriad different unforeseen things can happen in anyone's life, including an American's, that can almost instantly shatter the illusions built up over a lifetime -- illusions that often lead Americans into complacency about themselves and the world.  It is quite extraordinary the way Wolfe develops stories and characters.  He is unusual in the sense that in his books, the &quot;good guys&quot; don't always win and the &quot;bad guys&quot; often come out on top.  You simply can never predict what will happen, and that makes the stories so much more compelling and engaging.  You feel like you are living within the &quot;real life&quot; of a given character when you are reading about him/her.  I look forward to many more brilliant reads courtesy of Tom Wolfe.
0345440757|5.0|i bought this book after reading other books. i didn't believe in letting my child cry himself to sleep like other authors state to do. i started late with trying to get my Spirited child to sleep on his own. he was a year old and i found out i was pregnant again, so i really needed to try to help him get to sleep on his own before things got way to complicated for me. i started using her technuiques on a thursday night and by Sunday night i was finally able to put my son to bed with him being awake and he would drift off to dreamland without screaming and crying. my husband was amazed! he works 2nd shift so is only home Sat. and Sunday night, our son was awake sunday night and i told him to say the goodnights and put him to bed, he looked at me with wide eyes as to say &quot;are you sure&quot; he did that and sure enough not a peep out of him. i have bought this book for other new moms and they also stated how much they have loved it. no book is perfect, but this one in my opinion is as close as you can get
B00004TWZK|5.0|For the folks unfamiliar with the work of Stephen King, rest assured that the horrormeister and book-to-movie monarch is also a gifted writer of non-horror, and specifically of short stories.  This film is of a \\"novella\\" King wrote (drawing, as usual, from his own boyhood) about a foursome of pre-teen boys whose comraderie and determination takes them through a magic quest -- into the dark forest -- for the corpse of an agemate they didn't personally know.  It's one of four stories found in \\"Different Seasons\\", and the first of three from that book to make it to the big screen. Its mythic resonance is striking, with the youths planning their journey in what became a discovery of their own maturity, beyond their years.<br /><br />Unknown actors Wil Wheaton and River Phoenix are extraordinary, and each deserved an Oscar nomination for their roles. The first time drama for director Rob Reiner so impressed critics and fans that much was expected of him after this.  An insecure, yet creative boy and his son-of-an-alcoholic best friend lead their \\"gang\\" on an overnight  adventure, pitted against the small town's older \\"dimestore hoods\\" (Keifer Sutherland in an early role).  Along the way they face their own fears and sadness, fool round, and share \\"bonding moments\\".  Reiner directs with a boy's-eye-view, to the delight of all.<br /><br />Only caveat: [bad] language.  Only disappointment: Reiner deviates from the book during the leeches scene. River Phoenix went on to cutting edge roles, a cutting edge life, and a drug-related death.  Wil Wheaton went on to Star Trek: The Next Generation and the underrated film \\"The Last Prostitute\\".  Corey Feldman continued as a late-80s teen flick regular, and Jerry O'Connell did that Superman T.V. show.  As for bit players John Cusack and Richard Dreyfuss, their work continues to grow and evolve. Beware of versions which are edited for T.V.  If pondering whether it's appropriate for the 7-13 age group, watch with them due to the coarse language.  This film's message and presentation obscure even this.language.

B000002KDO|5.0|If someone was to put a gun to my head right now and ask me what my favourite metal album of all time was, I'd whisper nervously: '...Master...Master Of Reality' (actually, I'd probably scream, but that's beside the point). Of course, if I'd been listening to \\"Ride The Lightning\\" for three days on end (as I often do), my answer might be different, but 90% of the time Master of Reality is firmly at the top. Why? <BR>    Master Of Reality is the work of a band with enough experience to produce a developed, matured work, but still with enough youthfull enthusiam to make it entertaining. It satisfies everything I look for in music; heavy and melodic guitars, powerful innovative bass lines and furiously eccentric drumming. And, of course, great compositions. The difference between this and Paranoid is the confidence in style and song writing. When they made Paranoid they were still a fledgling cult band with no secure direction or image. But after that success, they felt more comfortable in writing ambitious, but still very heavy, guitar epics. Master Of Reality has no strange, insecure numbers or timid experimentation; this is quality from the first note to the last. Admittedly, subtleties are not too frequent, but an album like this needs no more complexity. The actual sound of the album is very heavy. This is the ultimate blueprint for doom metal, with thunderous bass drums and ferocious guitars. Even terminally slow and heavy bands like Cathedral can barely outdo this. But the twist in the plot is that this album is packed with melodies. From the guitar solo of 'Sweet Leaf' to the classic lead melody of 'Lord Of This World' to the delicacy of the two instrumentals, this album has it all. The most consistently heavy song on the album is the stage favourite 'Children Of The Grave', with an impossibly gloomy solo riff. However, this is not a downbeat album. 'Into The Void' isn't very heavy at all (although the name is misleading), and 'Solitude' is a lovely little romantic, if sad, inclusion. <BR>    MASTER is usually unjustly overshadowed by Paranoid. And for me at least,MASTER is the superior. Along with VOL. 4, SABBATH BLOODY SABBATH, and SABOTAGE, MASTER is Sabbath at their best!
B00005JKMQ|3.0|&quot;Ali&quot; is not quite the movie we were waiting for when it was being rumored around to be one of 2001's Oscar heavies (which it wasn't). But it is still a skillfull, stylish sometimes exciting movie about one of the most exciting and provocative figures in the history of sports. It is not so much a biographical movie as it is an examination of the man and his times. It is directed by Michael Mann (The Insider, Heat) with a rich visual style and focus. It does not span all of Ali's life but what it does explore it explores with a good amount of depth. Will Smith gives a great performance, his best ever on film, as the famed boxer and brings out some of the spirit and human side of Muhammad Ali. The boxing sequences are extremely convincing and exciting as well as the press conference sequences. The main problem with this film is the screenplay by Mann and Eric Roth (who got an Oscar nomination with Mann for &quot;The Insider&quot; and won for &quot;Forrest Gump&quot;), it does not strive to be a true dissection of Ali's life, it concentrates more on style and big names. Half of the movie concentrates on Ali's friendship with Malcolm X, which is fine, for a few minutes. You really don't learn anything you haven't seen already in Spike Lee's &quot;Malcolm X&quot; and Mario Van Peebles, good as he is, takes up too much space. We want to see an exhilarating, epic movie about an epic man and his epic career. This is more just a picking at Ali's brain and personal issues. It works, Mann presents a slick, sometimes emotional and entertaining movie, but it can be more. We are still waiting for the real Muhammad Ali movie.
B00005JKCF|5.0|This movie has been in the making for the better part of 20 years. Through all the trials, tribulations, bankruptcys and legal wranglings, director Sam Raimi has delivered the goods. And he's done so in a BIG way!!<br />Having read Spider-Man when I was younger I had high expectations for this film. My expectations were not only met, but they were exceeded. Spider-Man is now, and I say without hyperbole, the benchmark that all other comic book movies will be measured against.<br />Tobey Maguire, plays Peter Parker. Our reluctant, shy and unassuming hero. What sets him apart is that he doesn't fit the super hero mold. He's awkward, and a bit on the nerdy side. But all that's about to change. On a class field trip to Columbia University he is bitten by a genetically enhanced spider. He then undergoes a remarkable \\"metamorphesis\\". He takes on a spider's strength, speed, agility, and even a sixth \\"spider sense\\". From there on his world is turned upside down.<br />What makes Spider-Man work is that, at it's core, it's not about super powers or villains or costumes. It's about a person. A person who makes decisions and has to deal with the reprecussions of his actions. A person who is also at times uncomfortable with being a hero. That's what sets him apart from the rest of his super hero bretheren. The human element is what really sets the film apart from many of the other comic book movies. As in Superman you feel somewhat removed from the character, you really feel for Peter Parker and his predicament.<BR>For Parker, the choices are not always as simple as black and white. <br />Kirsten Dunst is absolutley radiant as Mary Jane Watson. Peter who has secretly been in love with Mary Jane since he was a child. There is a certain sweetness to the underlying love story that is genuine. Peter is, afterall, just a shy, awkward young man. But it's those underdog qualities that endear you to him. <br />Wilem Defoe turns in a riveting performance as one of Spideys oldest foes, the Green Goblin. The armor may look a little hokey but it's Defoe's mannerisms that really make this an inspired choice for him.<br />The CGI effects really make you believe he can do whatever a spider can. A few years ago this film would have had a completely different look. All the legal troubles were in fact, a mixed blessing. Fortunately, technology advanced enough to the point where the CGI really allowed the web head to swing effortlessly between sky scrapers with the greatest of ease.<br />This is one hero for the ages. See this movie. I can go on all day about this film. To him life is a great big bang up, wherever there's a hangup you'll find the Spider-Man!!
B00003CX5P|3.0|I know every time I see another Star Wars product with &quot;Limited Set,&quot; &quot;Collect all three,&quot; or &quot;Special Edition,&quot; today, I am going to heavily consider its actual contents.  There is this rule of nature I have found - the more you tamper or perfect things which already are at a high calibur, the more disappointed the result.  For example, it is like attempting to retake an Exam after you already recived an A+, twenty or so years after you first took it.  Very dangerous ground.<br />Watching THX-1138, I have seen Lucas altered his condemnation of &quot;Buy, buy more now...and be happy&quot; to a position where he is afraid to expose true art by worrying about numbers and percentages.  Personally, I think he is too critcal of critics, too set on traditional movie structure, and heavily concerned over quantity over quanity, perfection over natualism, and plot over character development.  The Phantom Menace, I find, proved not only the world, yet himself it is time to search for what is really attempting to be expressed.  <br />Thank goodness this movie was made.<br />I am glad Phantom came out because it proved Star Wars to be simply a fictious story, not something which everything in your life should revolve around.  It was a wake up call to let everyone see how foolish it was getting, which was getting to a point where everything dealing with Star Wars seemed to be sent from God alone and taken as a literal Bible.  I like Lucas, and I believe him to be a very smart and wise person, very reserved and to himself, articulating only in the scripts of his movies.  Yet because of this movie, we will definitly be allowed to see Star Wars as it was intentionly meant for, and what it was all about.  For this reason, I do think Lucas will improve.  All he can do now is go up and learn with this experience, just as all of us can, and I am also glad he recived the reaction he did, because every director needs it in order to mature.  It will create better movies in the end.          <br />There needs to be though a distinction of Phantom in relation to the SW movies, and movies overall.  If we were to agree with a rating, it probably would be two stars when compared to the saga, three stars compared to movies of today.  And this is from observation and a lifetime of experience as being a SW fan myself.
B00005JKL8|1.0|I stayed up until 12:30am on a work night to watch this lousy movie.  Sure it is a patriotic them, but the story is lame and unbelievable.  The characters (Owen Wilson and Gene Hackman) were WEAK!  The writing and story was WEAK.  The action was okay.  Don't buy this movie!  Don't rent it!  If someone has it, then you may want to borrow it for free.  It wasn't worth my money.  I'm just glad I didn't waste my money watching this in the theater.  If you want a believable and powerful and intense and patriotic war movie, get \\"Black Hawk Down\\".
B00005U2LM|4.0|Considering all of the weak hip-hop material that has came out in the past couple of years, especially in 2001, this is actually a decent drop. <br />After the HUGE disappointment from the worst album of the year THE W, I was 110% convinced that the Wu was finished for sure.  Then only about 6 months later they drop another album.  When I first heard about this I thought to myself what in the hell is the Wu doing?  It made too much sense to ignore the fact that the move to drop ANOTHER album so shortly after such a disappointment was going to be nothing less than an enhanced catastrophe for the clansmen.<br />To my surprise I found out this album is not too bad. Nothing like RETURN TO THE 36 CHAMBERS and not exactly compared to the Forever album (such mixed feeling about that album still to this day) I found that IRON FLAG is one of the best drops of 2001 (one of the very few).  Before I purchased this lp I thought to myself about how much of a disappointment this is probably going to be, but I had heard some pretty good reviews about the album and thought a lot of those reviews are probably just your usual Wu groupies but I had the wrong idea.  The Clan actually got it together and came as one unit (minus ODB) to put out a good/great album.<br />In the Hood: +++ (amazing intro, simple yet amazing)<BR>Rules: +++ (has its moments both good a bad)<BR>Chrome Wheels: ++++ (best track don't let the title fool you)<BR>Soul Power: ++ (grows on you but is pretty weak)<BR>Uzi: +++ (incredible instrumental here)<BR>One of These Days: +++ (catchy hook no doubt)<BR>Yall Been Warned: ++ (weakest track)<BR>Babies: ++++ (touching music here)<BR>Radioactive: +++ (Gza rips it, beat is weak)<BR>Back in the Game: +++ (nice overall, commercial track)<BR>Iron Flag: +++ (this one grows on you)<BR>Dashing: +++ (commercialism material but nice)<br />Overall I would give IRON FLAG around a 3.75 star rating which is a good rating especially for an album from the past year 2001, which was theworst year hip-hop has ever seen. If you are the common ex Wu fan as I am and are skeptical about this purchase then I would advise you give it a try, IRON FLAG compared to THE W is like comparing LIQUID SWORDS to BENEATH THE SURFACE, there is a MAJOR difference.
0553260111|5.0|The Bourne Identity is an awesome book!  It is an action-packed spy thriller.  There are so many twists and turns you must read it more than once.  It's a great book for any action fan-lots of killing and betrayl!  This is a must read.  At first I was intimidated by the thickness because I am not much of a reader.  This book got my attention from the very beginning.  I couldn't put it down.  I recommend this to any reader wanting an adventurous thrill.<br />The book is about an amnesiac trying to find his identity and avoiding assassins around every corner.  He falls in love with a woman who helps him try to find his true identity.....Jason Bourne....or is it?  The end is incredible!<br />Robert Ludlum made me feel like I was right in the middle of the action.  His great descriptions of characters and settings are fantastic.  He is a real genius and a true spy writer.
0141301120|2.0|Sorry, but this book was a real disappointment after Charlie and the Chocolate Factory! If you are a parent, read it first before considering it for your children- mine were bored.
0441003257|5.0|Everyone else has already said it, but I'll say it again.  This book was hysterical.  I couldn't put it down and I couldn't stop laughing.  It's kind of a Hitchhiker's Guide to the Armageddon.  The conversations between Aziraphale and Crowley, the THEM, the other 4 bikers of the Apocalypse.  There are so many things that make this book what it is.  Neil and terry make an incredible team.
630027179X|5.0|I noticed they removed the original and awesome 'Movie Poster' artwork from the box cover,the next thing to go will be the sound and picture quality. A pattern is starting to form here,its called decay. This movie is a 'master piece' and should be given the respect its due. I know its probably better on DVD,but if decay follows VHS,it will surely follow DVD. P.S. Carl Orff's (German Composer) 'Carmina Burana-O Fortuna' is awesome,Richard Wagner's (German Composer) 'Twilight of the Gods' Act III,Scene 2:'Siegfried's funeral march'(The Ring Cycle) isn't bad either.
B000002LVB|5.0|To be honest, I was disappointed listening to this album.  The first three Velvet Underground LPs I would've rated 7 stars out of five if I could have, and I'd heard that &quot;Loaded&quot; was &quot;loaded with hits&quot; ... it lacks the distinctive Velvet Underground sound, but as a classic rock album it still whips the hell out of most everything out there ... &quot;Wild Cowboy Bill&quot; is actually reminiscent of the Grateful Dead, and &quot;Who Loves the Sun&quot; sounds like Hollies-esque pop.  The highlights of the album are the definitive &quot;Sweet Jane&quot; and the sweet slow final jam &quot;Oh! Sweet Nuthin'&quot;.

0446608955|5.0|I can honestly say that this book was amazing. Never in my life has a book made me cry, and at the end of the story, I had tears in my eyes. This wonderful tale is all about two teenagers at the age of seventeen in love and the strange turns that life presents them with. It was all told through the eyes of a man named Landon who was 40 years old. I think that Nicholas Spark has such a wonderful talent to be able to really get into a teenage girl's mind and describe it so vividly. Not very often today do we hear about a man writing such a wonderful love story. Also being a seventeen year old girl, I really felt as if I was Jamie, the main girl character in which Landon falls in love with. I could feel her pain when she shared her secret with Landon. I could not tear myself away from this book for 5 hours straight. It was full of such love and excitement and also a sad but happy ending. I have not gotten a chance to see the movie yet, but if it still has the same plot, I'm sure it is great. I would recommend this book to anyone, male or female, who just simply wants to enjoy a wonderful book.
B0000640SA|5.0|This is probably one of the greatest films in the past ten years, and definatly most original. If you enjoy mystery, crime, or psychological thrillers, this is for you. Now if the film itself wasn't good enough this special edition DVD looks amazing, I plan on buying it the day it comes out.
0064409422|2.0|I remember reading this book for school and being very excited about reading a classic.  I also remember being very disappointed in it, though I probably couldn't have said why.  Remembering this, I decided to try it again now that I'm older.  And I still don't like it.  The characters were one dimensional, you don't get to know them at all.  It seems to be written by someone who thinks children are innocent little idiots who will be fascinated by anything with talking animals.  There was also far more Christian allegory than I ever realized the first time I read it, not a bad thing necessarily, but it wasn't all that skillfully done.  The main problem I had with it was that I cannot love a book without loving the characters, and these left me cold.  It has none of the inventiveness of, for instance, the NIMH books, and made me wonder why CS Lewis ever tried writing for children when he is so ill-suited, though there are hundreds of reviewers who would disagree.
B00005YXZH|5.0|I have reached a point of being thrilled with this CD. When I first heard it streaming off the website, amidst news of distribution problems and band break-up rumors, I was a little discouraged. What was coming out of my PC speaker sounded slow and just weird. It wasn't until months later, with the songs on a real CD blasting in my car, that I started to realize what was happening. The sounds, the layers - such a texture, and such beautiful songs. It's like taking a wonderful journey that just keeps getting better. <br />Someone always laments the end of Uncle Tupelo (me too, I miss them) and a certain \\"music fan\\" here called the album \\"overproduced [junk].\\" Interesting take, indeed. Just keep listening to Uncle Tupelo, buddy, and maybe if you wish hard enough they will have a reunion some day. But this album is so far removed from that time and place - it feels far removed from everything, and yet lurking right in the back of your mind at the same time. When the piano rolls in \\"I am Trying to Break Your Heart,\\" there is a bit of an explosion in my consciousness, and the feeling that the lock bar just came down and the roller coaster is lurching forward. I love that feeling, the anticipation, and I love this album.
0767812166|4.0|John Carpenter's STARMAN can be accused of stealing from everyone from Spielberg to every science fiction picture that came before, but there is a lot more to this film than most and its a surprise from John Carpenter. An alien comes to earth and somehow takes on the form of a widoed woman's (Karen Allen) late husband (Jeff Bridges). The military finds out about it, and as usual they go after him/it.  The movie is part road picture, romance, and sci-fi. Everything about this movie would dictate predictability , but the main ingredient is that it has characters to really care about. Karen Allen's character is still in mourning for her late husband and the alien/husband Jeff Bridges is a shock to the system.  Then comes the road picture where she relunctantly helps him for his rendezvous to be saved by his alien kin for he can only survive a short time in the human form. And in all road pictures of this sort, these people will fall in love.  Again, the plot is somewhat predictable.  It has conventional military characters especially the George Fox character played by the late great character actor Richard Jaeckel and the government scientist played by Charles Martin Smith.  Through all the conventionalism, the movie works partly because of Jeff Bridges quirky performance way ahead of Dustin Hoffman's Rain Man or Tom Hanks' Forrest Gump, and the romantic angle of the two main leads. The movie generates more repeat viewings than Spielberg's E.T. because it doesn't have all those kids running around trying to be cute, it is less manipulative, and it is light on the sugercoating. A great piece of work from the guy who directed horror classics like  Halloween and The Thing.
B000002JS6|5.0|Accept no substitutes, this is the mack daddy, uber ales hard rock album.  &quot;Apetite for Destruction&quot; pips it for emotional range, but hey, who wants sensitivity when you need serious chordage: big and fat and loud.  Turn the volume up to eleven -- if you can -- and shake with the thunderation of the brothers Young.  Refined folk find this stuff repulsive.  They call AC/DC juvenile.  They can't stand them guitars and all that heavy-duty sonic assault.  Well, let 'em have their Perrier and canape.  Demand your AC/DC - in the morning, in the evening, ain't you got fun?  &quot;You Shook Me&quot; is practically up there with the national anthem for reps at high school games.  &quot;Back in Black&quot; is a nice little ditty to sing in the shower.  And &quot;Have a Drink on Me&quot; jumps off a cliff after the break.  What a fall!  If that special someone is running down your battery, or if the boss has you squealing like a pink faced pigee inside, this album is your tonic, your elixir, your gate to primordial release and blessed relief.  The lads from Oz deliver at all hours with super powers.
B00005QK3W|5.0|I do not own &quot;Driving Rain&quot; at this time, however, I'm sure I would love it. Anything, Sir Paul does I love it, he's a great person and a talent writer, singer,composser and musician. I wish him all the happiness life can bring. When the Beatles first came to the US, I was a died hard &quot;Elvis&quot; fan, still am, however, Sir Paul is now tired with &quot;Elvis&quot; in my heart. I saw his concert on 4th of July at RFK stadium, in Washington, DC, wow! what a concert. I got the same feeling seeing Sir Paul, as I did when I saw &quot;Elvis&quot; in concert, both a once in a life time concert.  Paul, be safe and happy always. Congrat's on your marriage, although no one will take the place of your beloved wife &quot;Linda&quot; and the mother of your children. Keep singing, always.
B00005JKCF|5.0|Spider Man is one of the best movies i've ever seen! The graphics were absoulutely incredible and the trill and rush of the whole plot of the entire story makes not want to miss one moment of the picture. Plus i suggust if you like great movie sound effects, this is the best movie to see! The every little detailed sound that happens in movie, you can hear. I also suggest this movie if you liked the Matrix, but were looking for something a little more tame. Why, is that how parts are slowed down, etc. just like the Matrix. Overall, expect this movie to dominant the box office after its $114 MILLION DOLLAR earnings on its OPENING WEEKEND! Definally make sure you see this movie!
B00005AFMT|5.0|I wrote a review a while ago. Guess I have to rave about this genius recording again. I've become more of a KC fan since listening to this many years ago, and have to say that KC is the most original, inventive artistic venture I've ever encountered. I'm always amazed.<br />Now...as for Discipline...this is near perfection as far as &quot;rock&quot; music is concerned. I cannot imagine anything on this CD sounding dated, and another 20 years from now I believe it will sound more current than whatever popular drivel the radios will play. This is a true classic for then, now and the future.<br />So BUY it. Adrian's voice soars, Belew's drumming astounds, and the guitar work from Belew and Fripp will send the most jaded guitarist into fits of adrenalin. And Levin...always putting the right notes in the right place; building fat, muscular bass tones that KC ride, seeming effortlessly, in all their powerful synergy. Tight, brilliant, and speeding like a multi-geared machine in full throttle...I'll go to my grave holding this puppy in one hand, and &quot;Thrak&quot; in the other.
B00005B36H|2.0|being comfortable with TOOL and its side-project (A Perfect Circle) I bought this CD right away. at first I wasn't sure what to expect, actually... I thought it was going to be something as monumental as everyone was saying. this album was kept under wraps from leaking out onto the Internet. after all the fuss, I look back at this CD and think \\"wow, what a waste of time\\".<br />recently I have tried to get back into the groove of this album, but I get 2 tracks into the CD and turn it off. it looks like TOOL really has lost it. they used to be heavy, offensive and whacked out. now their just the latter one. don't get me wrong, cuss words don't justify the greatness of an album--but this CD is just lacking in overall attitude. the only track worthy of listening to is \\"ticks and leeches\\". it seems to me that ol' Maynard got a little bit sidetracked with his other band \\"A Perfect Circle\\", which I didn't mind--but don't own, that his musical style really has gone more eclectic or soft. I guess Maynard did too many drugs and now he's John Lennon.<br />if I were to stand back and tell you the best TOOL album--it would be any of them but this, I cannot recommend this to even my friends. if they wanted it, they could have it. this is a sell-out tragedy if I ever heard one...<br />anyway, if you're looking for some gritty TOOL check out their Opiate EP. if it's the production value and epic songs you want--go for AENIMA. don't be fooled by the appearance of this CD, the inlay won't justify the $ you dish out...<br />pick up some Nothingface or something else instead.
B000060P79|5.0|~This cd was great, i havent stopped listening to it since it came out~ Lyrics are good, and the music is great... I would reccomend this cd tho anyone who is into New Found Glory, Midtown, and all the other great punk bands.. SO WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR buy the cd alreay! ;)
B00000ILDE|5.0|Its so rare in, my opinion to find a fallow up movie(even though Aliens is totally different form Alien) that really dose live up to the first masterpeice. Ecspecily in the Horror, Science Fiction, Fantasy genre. I used to think there was no such thing as a follow up flim that was better then the first. Aliens is a example that it could be done.<BR>From the opeaning sceen you are held in compelling suspence that last the whole 2 and half hours without it ever letting up. Sigourney Weaver deilevers a fantastic performance. As for the DVD? It is great.
6302035074|3.0|This movie is a disturbing movie right from the beginning, even if it a very disturbing movie its concept is very one of a kind.  If u have a weak stomach I suggest you dont watch this movie. It starts off with two girls that are going to a concert but run into an escape confict and wish to buy drugs. This leads to their kidnap, rape, and murder by the convict and his dad, grandfather and the dad's girlfriend. The murderers end up staying at one of the girls house and her parents realize that they had killed their daughter. They take matters into their own hands which is unbelivable they way they handle it.

B00005JKYS|5.0|As a two-time veteran of the War in Vietnam, and as a member of the First Cavalry Division during my second tour, \\"We Were Soldiers\\" reminded me of how it really was. I was fortunate, as a veteran, to view a pre-release showing.<br />This is a no-nonsense film. It does not represent the US Army as a bunch of pot-smoking baby-killers, but as SOLDIERS sent on a difficult mission by their country. Aside from the (first half of) \\"Green Berets\\", this is the only movie of the conflict which bears any resemblence to reality, and it represents it well.<br />While I was not involved in this particular action, I have participated in similar operations. As a helicopter pilot during the War, I could actually relive my sensations as the helicopters landed in LZ X-ray taking enemy fire. I could picture the casualties I picked up, and smell the burning flesh. I felt the anxiety of knowing what was facing my crew and I as we  made each trip to resupply units and pick up casualties on a \\"hot\\" landing zone.<br />As accurate as the military aspects were, so were the events on the home front regarding the human emotion and family side of the equation. The wives' \\"chain of concern\\" aspect of military life was typified when LTC Moore's wife intercepted the casualty telegrams from the taxi drivers to provide a dignified delivery of the bad news. This was, in fact, the situation when we started receiving heavy casualties before the Department of Defense was prepared to deal with it.<br />One must never lose sight of the fact that this is a true story, and that the authors of the book from which the film was made, General Moore and Joe Galloway, have made a contribution to history as much as any of the seminal works by Bernard Fall relating to Indochina. Anyone who tells me in the future that they got their impressions of Vietnam from \\"Platoon\\" or \\"Apocolypse Now\\" will sense my disgust as I tell them to leave their world of fantasy, and see \\"We Were Soldiers\\" if they want to know about the Vietnam War.<br />Mel Gibson, extraodinary as ever as LTC Moore, and director Randall Wallace have done an outstanding job in relating this story on film.<br />I suppose my bottom line is that I understand how a veteran of the Normandy Invasion must have felt during the opening invasion scenes at Omaha Beach in \\"Saving Private Ryan\\". It took a lot for me to regain my composure when the lights went on. But also, I felt a pride in having been a part of the Vietnam experience in service to our wonderful country.Vietnam War.<br />Mel Gibson, extraodinary as ever as LTC Moore, and director Randall Wallace have done an outstanding job in relating this story on film.<br />I suppose my bottom line is that I understand how a veteran of the Normandy Invasion must have felt during the opening invasion scenes at Omaha Beach in \\"Saving Private Ryan\\".

B0000542DH|5.0|The facted that this very violent and profound cult classic was loved by thousands and hated by millions and blamed for over 25 copy cat crimes is no suprise to me. This is one of the most vivid, and in your face movies I own. <BR>The acting is sensational(there must be somsthing wrong with anyone who thinks otherwaise with that statement) The movie is about two really [angry] lovers who hit the road and kill over 50 people on their little honey moon to highyway 666. Meanwhile the media turns them into mainstream superstars and the blood thirsty coulpe get a huge fan base just for being rebels up agianst the American system of rules. I think what alot of people did not like about this film was the nagitive honasty. The veiwer gets carring about the flims anti hero's, because their so much in love, but at the same time you hate their guts. Its balanced perfactly and it works to.
B00005RG6M|5.0|Although I don't have a DVD-Audio player,this disc sounds awesome in DTS 5.1.One of the great things about this disc is that unlike some other DVD-Audio titles,this disc has no unwanted breaks between songs.The sound quality is fantastic.The menu is easy to navigate and it includes the original pre-Wayne's World Bohemian Rhapsody video.If the DVD audio quality is better then DTS 5.1,then I look forward to hearing it in it's true Hi-Def version.I hope this is just the start of what's to come for this format because there are thousands of other titles that could benefit from this format.
0800196767|5.0|I loved this movie it was so cool and I thought Mara Wilson was great as Matilda the sweet but tough little cookie with magical powers, the bullies like the horrible Miss Trunchbull don't stand a chance against the amazing super kid! I recommend Matilda to anyone who likes movies about spunky children with magical powers. This is by far my favorite Mara Wilson movie!
B000005JA8|1.0|Wish I could cuddle up to this one like the rest of the 13 year olds and grown ups, but I gotta throw this one back.

I'm more about music than anti-music, so maybe that's my short coming, but I own thousands upon thousands of recordings  -from Abba to Zappa-  and without a doubt this is the most unlistneable item in my collection.<br />1 Star for making me go back to prove myself wrong.

B000002KBH|5.0|\\"Box of Rain\\" is both musically and lyrically one of the most beautiful songs I have ever heard. Note that the reviewer who characterized it as querulous doesn't have the faintest notion of what the song is about. [5+ stars]<br />\\"Friend of the Devil\\". This bouncy, up-tempo tune is by turns emotionally upbeat, humorous and plaintive. The lyrics are exceedingly brilliant, but then, that's the main signature of the entire album. [5 stars]<br />\\"Sugar Magnolia\\" shows that although their musicality is not always up to the standards of the Band ('Big Pink' through 'Stage Fright'), the lyrics are, as I said before, nothing short of genius. They are so good that at times the music rides on the back of the lyrics, which become strong, wondrous beasts of burden. [4 stars]<br />\\"Operator\\" is a throwback to the style of 'Workingman's Dead', but better. On this entire album, the Dead have put together some of the most amazing introductions, bridges, etc. that have ever graced vinyl, tape, or any other recorded medium. [4 stars]<br />\\"Candy Man\\". The harmony vocals at the chorus are as good [or better] than anything the Beach Boys attempted, or Crosby, Stills and Nash for that matter. The song and the lyrics are full of sadness, but there's always that hopeful feeling underneath it all, which manifests itself in the gorgeous turns of phrase, the smoothness of the playing and singing, which is somehow full of light even in the dark times. [5+ stars]<br />\\"Ripple\\" The same fellow who called \\"Box of Rain\\" 'querulous' claimed this [at times] lukewarm effort to be the most impressive cut. After yet another brilliant introduction, this song settles into a nice enough groove, then lets the story line carry us into heaven on earth and maybe beyond. [3½+ stars]<br />[\\"Ripple\\"] segues directly into \\"Brokedown Palace\\", where the poetry and vision become even fuller, deeper, brighter, the metaphors more magically wrought, the emotions more exquisitely paraded. [5+ stars]<br />\\"Till the Morning Comes\\". This up-tempo number is the most fun, uninhibited song on the album. Wonderful, simply wonderful! [4½+ stars]<br />\\"Attics of My Life\\" rounds out the experience in a big, warm wonderful way. \\"In the secret space of dreams, where I, lying, dream amazed!\\" Again, the harmonic progression is like a stairway winding into and through a new spiritual reality.

0783222955|4.0|Though no novel-based Movie truly compares to the book itself, \\"To Kill a Mocking Bird\\" came extremly close.  With such well casted actors, this movie truly portrayed the problems in ancient and even today's society.  It shows the world through the eye of a child, and how innocence knows no evil.  Well done!
B000056K04|1.0|im a fan of dmb, and this is unacceptable. their previous work had so much attitude and made you want to dance. what is this? it a few songs tailored to mtv music videos.. thats it.<br />although i do like the space between (i mean, its hard to not like it when mtv and radio crams it into your head like that). but the rest is lacking. a disappointment. but they'll come back on top next time. its not the end of them. they are a very inspirational and talented group.
B00004RFCM|5.0|I discovered sex and the city only about a year ago. But since then i have managed to purchase all of the episodes on DVD and borrowed some from a friend on her copies of VHS. I have seen and loved every single episode. The first season is great. It is where we get to know the characters and begin to follow along in their journey of evolution. Its exciting to see where they began with their ideas about the show and the characters, if you haven't seen season 1 then you have to get this and watch it right away.<br />This is a must own for all women and even my fiance seems to love this show! Although he doesn't want to admit it to his friends. But he couldn't stop watching episode after episode when I first got the DVD set.

Summer Teeth was a good album it mixed old with new, this..this album made me sad. At first i thought i put in my Better Than Ezra disc by mistake. But BTE pulled of weirdness and it sounded good, this album just sounds like junk junk and confused junk. This album just seems not to be worth the money. Go buy Chelsea Walls the remake of The Lonely One is beautiful. I dont agree with dling music from the net but save your money and dk YHF
B00005JKCF|5.0|I went into the theater expecting some mild entertainment, something that was totally overdone, silly, and [not real], and not like the Spider-Man comics at all. However, I was SO delighted to discover that I had been hugely wrong. <br />First of all, Tobey Maguire, despite all the criticism he's had, was excellent as Peter Parker. He was so dorky and lovable, I just couldn't help but crack up watching him running for the bus and snapping \\"pictures for the newspaper\\" of Mary-Jane in the museum. He may be a superhero by the end of the movie, but he's still a nerd when he takes his mask off. Tobey Maguire is always going to be a nerd. That's why I love him.<br />Secondly, Sam Raimi blew me away! He didn't try to make Spider-Man over-realistic or new-millenium-cool. He simply captured the essence of what Spider-Man really is--outrageous, impossible, yet incredibly enviable stunts, the sense of victory over injustice, and all the little details down to the random passerby that points and shouts: \\"Look! It's Spider-Man!\\" It just had, as someone said below, this perfect B-movie quality that was completely irresistible. I totally felt like I was watching one of those nostalgic old superhero movies from decades ago, expecting a POW! and BANG! to pop up on the screen any second. <br />This is really Spider-Man at its truest and purest. It's no wonder it shot the box-office record up to [$] in its first weekend! Go see it. You won't be disappointed, I promise.
0140143505|5.0|...The book is comprised of letters exchanged by a New York-based American television script writer and various personnel at a small London bookshop where she prefers to buy all her books. The bookseller tolerates her insistance on paying in US currency and stoically endures her teasing and scolding when they send her a book that doesn't quite come up to her expectations. What comes across in this twenty year exchange of letters is the ease with which making and keeping friends is possible--if one only makes the effort. In the years immediately following World War II, Hanff saw that rationed food stuffs were sent to the shop so that they could be shared among the staff. The letters of thanks sent to Hanff and the enthusiasm with which the booksellers greeted friends of the author who happened to visit the shop when taking their vacations in England shows that their affection for their American friend was sincere and deep.<br />Don't read this collection with the expectation that you will get an in-depth view of the characters' lives. Read it as a way of discovering how simple it is for human beings to drop their defenses and treat one another with respect, civility, humor, and openness. Read it when your hope for humanity is at its lowest.<br />\\"84, Charing Cross Road\\" reminded me of Jan Struther's \\"Mrs. Miniver.\\" I believe \\"Mrs. Miniver\\" was originally published as a series of newspaper articles. When collected into a book, it was rightly or wrongly perceived as a novel. Readers who see it as a novel usually have complaints about it's structure and seeming lack of plot (if this is what you desire, you can always rent the movie). Read as a collection of finely crafted observations of daily life in England during World War II, it's a moving tribute to the strength and durability of the human spirit. \\"Miniver\\" and \\"84, Charing Cross Road\\" make great back-to-back reads.
B00005RRG9|5.0|Kudos to Disney for reaching into thier non animated archives to put out great special editions.<br />Parent Trap was one of the Non-Animated films from Disney I've been waiting for (another is the first couple of Herbie:The Love Bug movies. The first &quot;Love Bug&quot; is confirmed for next year!).<br />Most of you reading already know the story and how much you like it. <br />Now, you can rest assured that that movie has gotten a great DVD treatment. <br />It comes in a new transfer in animorphic widescreen (for the first time on video, the credit sequence is not slightly squeezed like it used to be on pan and scan tapes and laserdiscs). <br />The color is as vivid as I would expect from a mid 60's technicolor film. <br />It also comes with a 5.1 remix. The mono soundtrack is not included but the 5.1 mix is quite appropriately understated and seems to use only the original sound elements (unlike JAWS and Superman's 5.1 remixes).<br />It also comes with a Donald Duck cartoon that will show before the start of the movie (or you can select it from the menu)just like they did in the theatrical release.<br />The extras include documentaries, commentary with the director David Swift and Hayley Mills, trailers and TV spots, radio spots, soundtrack deconstructions, an interview with Hayley Mill's photo double, still galleries and more.<br />This release is clearly made for the adult collector while still being all importantly kid friendly.
6305537313|5.0|I saw this movie a few years ago and was suddenly captured by Audrey Hepburn's charm and poise.  When it was released onto DVD, I couldn't believe it.  This comedy/drama is a wonderful movie to watch and I highly reccomend it to anyone.  Buy now!
B00004U680|4.0|This is long overdue but I find it hard to believe that demand was so little for these two Glitter area records that they had to be realeased on one cd! The linear notes are not that great and it talks about resotred artwork - it's minimal. Also the set list on the albums is off. Maybe they are going by the UK releases on the US Bell releases the song order is off. For example on the debut album Can the Can isn't even on here! You've got to be kidding. On Quatro they replace the original album cut of The Wild One with the single version. Yes the single version is cool, but so is the album on which is now even harder to find than the single version which is the one that is used on all the SQ greatest hits cd's coming out now. Seems just a little off.
B000002H72|5.0|So, I'm browsing around a funky shoe store (of all places) in the town where I live, when...wait...what's that lovely sound? Could it be?  Yes! It's my beloved Pixies!  I walked around that store grinning like a lunatic and I swear my heart started beating faster.  You see, &quot;Doolittle&quot; came out when I was a senior in high school and, soon after, I became a Pixies addict.  They were the most amazingly cool band I had ever heard. I loved their crazy lyrics and superbly loud sound.  Over the years, I ended up losing, selling, etc. all of my Pixies CDs (what was I thinking!!).  You aren't likely to hear an old Pixies song going about your daily business, unlike, say, Nirvana or REM, so hearing them in that store sent me into the stratosphere!  I literally made a mad dash to the CD store down the street; the only thought occupying my brain: &quot;Must buy Doolittle NOW.&quot;  Not just any Pixies CD would do.  My appetite was whetted and it HAD to be Doolittle.  It's kind of like when you get a craving for Ben &amp; Jerry's Heath Bar Crunch -- no other flavor is going to cut it!  I bought the CD and spent the rest of the afternoon listening to it over and over again.  I know this word is horribly overused in regard to music, but Doolittle is some kind of masterpiece (albeit a rather pyscho one).  All of a sudden, I was 18 again, screaming &quot;Debaser&quot; out my car window on the way to school.  Every song on this album has something wonderful to offer, but you have to give it a chance.  It may sound jarring and/or nonsensical at first...just give it time to settle into your brain.  And will it ever!  I promise.  Pretty soon, you'll be walking around your workplace singing, &quot;All I'm saying, pretty baby.  La la love you, don't mean maybe.&quot;  My favorite songs on this album include &quot;Number 13&quot; (love that funky guitar styling at the end!) and &quot;Gouge Away&quot; (consult the story of Sampson and Delilah in the Old Testament of the Bible tomake sense of the   lyrics).  However, the entire CD is as original and invigorating today as it was in 1989.  It's no mystery why so many bands cite the Pixies as a major influence.  C'mon, let's say it altogether now, &quot;Wanna grow...up to be...be a Debaser!&quot;
B000002UAX|4.0|After listening to Sgt.Pepper and the slighty ok Magicial Mystery Tour, I knew that this would be a better album than both of them. I was right. The 1st disc has no fillers, the 2nd disc has some. Oh well, with 30 songs, you can't please everyone. This first disc I will review the album song by song<br />1.Back In The USSR-This is a great opener with a wonderful Beach Boys sounding bridge.<br />2.Dear Prudence-A nice ballad with some flowing arpeggio lines from John. A keeper.<br />3.Glass Onion-Intresting chord changes with all the 7ths floating around. Nice reminincent lyrics.<br />4.Ob-La-Di, Ob-La-Da-Infectious chorus! The only time they play something reggae like. <br />5.Wild Honey Pie-WHAT THE HELL IS THIS?! Strange riff. Strange tune. I like it!<br />6.The Continuing Story Of Bungalow Bill-You think that with the intro, it would be a disastrous Beatles-does-flamenco tune, but it's actually a singalong kinda tune. Very funny. Cool.<br />7.While My Guitar Gently Weeps-The best Harrison tune probably ever. great solo by eric Clapton. Nice touch with the organ.<br />8.Happiness Is A Warm Gun-Great tune. Sounds like prog rock, in a way each part sounds diffrent from the last. Cool.<br />9.Marta My Dear-Yet another cute song from Paul. Nothing much here.<br />10.I'm So Tired-In the vein of &quot;Im Only Sleeping,&quot; this song is very trippy. Pretty cool.<br />11.Blackbird-That famed classic with just Paul and a metronome. Very very cool. Nice touch with the bird.<br />12.Piggies-Uh, ok. The weird Harrison tune. Has a classicial sound to it.<br />13.Rocky Racoon-ALL HAIL THIS SONG! Just kidding, but man, it is good! Country folk at its best.<br />14.Dont Pass Me By-Sort of like country, but with a Beatles touch. Nice fiddle work.<br />15.Why Dont We Do It In The Road?-Why don't we? Very bluesy. My band loves playing this song and turning it into a jam session that goes on FOREVER.<br />16.I Will-YET ANOTHER HAPPY SONG FROM PAUL! Eh, it's nice. Nothing big.<br />17.Julia-The highlight of the album. Just John playing and singing. It's a perfect closer.<br />Stay tuned for Part 2-The Good &amp; Bad!
B00005V1Z0|4.0|Lara Croft is the kind the person I dreamed I could be like when I was a child.  She is her own person.  A powerful female spirit.  This film showed that women are as capable as men.<BR>I couldn't help but think of the Indian Jones' movies while watching this, which is not a bad thing.  I think there were some rifts in the plot but it mad for a good story and was full of wonderful action scences. I wish I had seen this film in the theatre.
B000002UAX|4.0|I told you about the good side of the album with Disc 1. Now the bad side-Disc2. Most of these songs are forgettable, but there are still some keepers. As with Disc 1, I will review the album track-by-track.<br />1.Birthday-Starts out good, until the \\"yeah-yeah\\" part comes in and ruins EVERYTHING. Literally. <br />2.Yer Blues-Pathetic. The Beatles have never been good with blues. This is no exception.<br />3.Mother Nature's Son-Classic folk with some nice horn arrangements.<br />4.Everybody's Got Something To Hide Except Me And My Monkey-The intro sounds like Rolling Stones, then the song goes into a funky rocker. Nice.<br />5.Sexy Sadie-Nice use of echo on this tune. A trippy piano ballad with lala background vocals.<br />6.Helter Skelter-OH YEAH!! The best track on the album! It's so good! The heaviest track the Beatles have ever done.<br />7.Long, Long, Long-The quietest track on the album. It's a very pretty Harrison tune again. George always seems to do something that sounds un-Beatles like. Nice.<br />8.Revolution 1-The \\"Hey Jude\\" b-side version is a lot better, but it's a great tune that you can jam on.<br />9.Honey Pie-It sounds like another sappy love song from McCartney, it turns into a silly musicial tune from the 1920's. Not that great.<br />10.Savoy Truffle-This is where George Harrison trys to sound like John Lennon. Very Cream-like in a way. Cool.<br />11.Cry Baby Cry-Oh no, accordion! Oh well, it's barely audible. Sounds like another trippy ballad from Lennon. Nice piano work.<br />12.Revolution 9-[FILLER!!]<br />13.Good Night-Pretty tune, but the part where Ringo whispers at the end is just plain corny.<br />Well, there you have it. My review of the White album. Hope you enjoyed it.
B00005JKCF|5.0|I was so stoked when i found out that the spiderman movie was going to the big screen that I saw this movie the day it came out. I sat through te whole movie in amazement, terrific action sequences, amazing acting, and even some self critisizm with some of the goblin's catch phrases. If you haven't seen it, see it, and if you've seen it, see it again, i just can't wait for the sequel
B00005AXEL|5.0|I NEVER REALLY LIKED STEVIE NICKS BUT WHEN THIS ALBUM CAME OUT I LOVED IT IMMEDIATELY.  ONLY BECAUSE MY SISTER IS A FAN OF COURSE.  THEN WHEN HER CONCERT CAME I WENT.  AND SINCE THEN I'VED LISTENED TO EVERY ONE OF HER ALBUMS WHICH ARE ALL GREAT.  SO I RECOMMEND THIS ALBUM AND THE OTHERS.  I'M SURE YOU'LL ENJOY THEM AS I HAVE!
B00005QAPK|3.0|Janus Films participated in the restoration of this film and you would think that that alone would ensure high standards of quality.  And for the most part it did.  But unmentioned in all the reviews of this DVD is the fact that the best film of the three, Toby Dammit,does not have its English soundtrack included.<BR>Terence Stamp is English and he spoke his part in English.(and what an amazing bit of verbal it was) It just ain't the same thing in dubbed French by another actor. An earlier release of this film delivered the English soundtrack as an option but did not allow you to turn off the English subtitles! (Some of the people that put these things together are really lacking in simple, common sense.) Also the image quality on the previous release is faded and not real sharp.  Image quality on this current DVD is excellent. Rich color and very sharp.  So the horror of it all is you are left with a very well done restoration with a rather important detail inexplicably left out.  The English soundtrack exists and isn't this the whole point of DVD's?  I took a chance buying this DVD hoping for an improved version that fixed some of the problems on the earlier release.<BR>The frustrating thing is that it is so close to being there, but a French speaking Terence Stamp is just absurd.  Janus Films was also involed in the Criterion Collection new version of Amarcord and they did it perfectly.  Everything is there.  Wish they used as much care on this one.
B00005KHJM|4.0|After hearing so much about \\"The Wicker Man\\" I assumed that when I finally watched it I'd be let down. Happy to say that my assumption was wrong. Sure it is very hokey in some scenes, extremely campy and dated in the early 70s. In fact, at the beginning of some of the musicals numbers I started cringing at how corny it was. However, by the time the song ended I was enchanted by the bizarreness of it all. In the grand scheme of things these quirky aspects only added to the otherworldly charm of Summerisle.<br />After \\"The Wicker Man\\" ended I sat there going \\"Hmmm. Pretty good, but not all that impressive.\\" A few hours later, I was still thinking about the film. Hours became days and I finally realized how much this movie stuck in my subconscious. Upon rewatching it, I was pleasantly amazed how good of a film \\"The Wicker Man\\" is. How the filmmakers presented a pagan society in modern times was particularly interesting. Though certain historical elements were twisted to fit the film, it was reassuring to see that \\"The Wicker Man\\" was fairly well researched. What makes the film so effective is it's ambiguity. Who is actually \\"good\\" and who is \\"evil?\\" The pagans or the christians? Sergeant Howie or Lord Summerisle? Is the idea of religion in general at fault? Lots of interesting questions. Unique idea. Great ending. A fun performance by Christopher Lee. All add up to a really good film. Modern pagans will get a huge kick out of this one.
B00005RRG9|5.0|This DVD set on the spectacular original Parent Trap was well worth the wait. It contains one disc with the movie and Hayley's commentary to it and another with quite a bit of extras including how the movie was made, the tricks and secrets and a musical video of &quot;Let's get together&quot;. Contains recent interviews with some of the cast. I highly recommend this product.
B00000AF98|5.0|No, 'Crazy Nights' is not a heavy album by any stretch. It's a poppier, radio friendly KISS. I'm not denying this. But the songs are so good, I can't help but love this record.<br />This was the 80's, metal music was on top and fans were going to KISS concerts as much to dance as to head bang. The band replied with an album chock full of arena-friendly anthems  and sing-alongs. From Paul's opener 'Crazy, Crazy Nights' to Gene's sultry 'Thief in the Night' this is the best KISS record of the 80's. Gene finally seems to have returned to the band full-time and hits with 'Good Girl Gone Bad,' 'Hell or High Water' amongst others. His weakest effort 'No, No, No' has a sort of punk to it that might have made it a better fit on the later 'Revenge' record.<br />Not only was there a power ballad in 'Reason To Live' but Paul Stanley delivers two absolute 'lost classics' here: The rockin' 'I'll Fight Hell To Hold You' and the bright 'Turn On the Night.' Each song features a powerful lead vocal from Stanley and tunes that rival the best the songwriter has produced.<br />'Crazy Nights' was not for every KISS fan. But it was absolutely for this fan. Anyone interested in strong songwriting should love this record. Metal purists may not be as impressed.
B00005JKCF|5.0|Comic book adaptations are a mixed bunch, ranging from the excellent (Superman) to the excremental (Batman and Robin). And thankfully the latest superhero film is right up there with the greats. Tobey Maguire IS Spiderman, swinging around buildings, saving the world from Green Goblins and so on. His transformation from geeky Peter Parker to the ultra-cool Spidey is outstanding. Kirsten Dunst is good as his love interest.  Throughout the film's running time, the action set pieces are well paced and inventive. The action is brilliantly done and thrilling, and the CGI blends seamlessly with the live action stunts.<br />Fans of the comic will not be disappointed, for the film stays true to it's origins, yet has enough adventure to make it new and attention-grabbing. Director Sam Raimi (the Evil Dead films) has created a world, which is fun and adventurous. There are problems; William Dafoe is limited in his performance as The Green Goblin, with the restraining suit creating a somewhat gauche characterisation. And Raimi sometimes goes a bit far with the retina-popping visuals. Regardless, it's first-class popcorn- munching entertainment, with enough action and FX to satisfy audiences.
B00000AF95|3.0|'Animalize' was a huge record for KISS and a huger tour. Whatever interest they rediscovered taking their makeup off for the 'Lick It Up' record was solidified with this record and tour. KISS was back on top and riding a crest of pop metal to a new fan base. <br />Now is 'Animalize' a great record? Not especially. Parts of it are. 'Animalize' suffers most from Gene Simmons clearly viewing the album as a secondary project to what else he was doing at the time. This put the pressure of the record on Paul Stanley and, frankly, Paul, for his part, delivered. From the mega hit 'Heaven's On Fire,' to a ballsy rocker like 'I've Had Enough' to the powerhouse 'Thrills In the Night' Paul bats 1000 on this record. Unfortunately Gene doesn't deliver at all. His songs are childish and completely forgettable and they drag this album down into the muck.<br />Paul's top notch production also helps bring the album up, but, in the end, 'Animalize' is a record with three decent songs but nothing landmark. On the road, 'Animalize' was great business and put KISS back onto the map as arena headliners to be reckoned with.
B000002P72|5.0|This is the greatest live recording I've heard from anyone. B.B. is cookin', Lucille sounds fantastic and the crowd is loud and proud. What else can a blues fan ask for ? This recording makes you wish you were in Chicago in 1964 at the RegaL so you could SEE what was a fantastic week of appearances by the King of Blues. In a word: WOW ! This a must own recording, as a matter of fact get 2 because you'll wear one out !
B00005YW4H|5.0|I suppose like all musical aesthetic evaluations, what your ear is used to and what your expectations are influence how your ear greets a new musical offering. I personally find that so much popular music is formulaic and overwrought; barely pubescent young girls in jarring provocative garb with artificial and unconvincing emotional musical renderings. Norah Jone's first CD is a breath of fresh air. With delicate and sensitive nuance she draws you in and speaks to you in her gentle honey silk voice. She is authentic and unpretentious. What a welcome change from the ear shattering, soul numbing musical lies that seem to be standard fare these days. <br />I find many of the reviews harsh and the comparisons to other artists unfair. If you are looking for adrenaline, look elsewhere. If you want soothing and intimate then this is a CD that you will truly enjoy and come back to often. Thank you Norah.
1577311523|5.0|Thank GOD for this book! I got it at hellish time in my life, when I had a three-month wait to know whether an accident I'd had would result in HIV infection.  This book helped me detach from my panicky, scared self (mind).  It also had exercises to help boost the immune system - talk about serendipity.  (By the way, three months later, I tested NEGATIVE for HIV, and have continued to test negative since - Yes!)
0385484518|4.0|A touching portrait of a dying man's wish to impart to others those things in life we would be better to focus on.  Although there is no denying the essence of what Morrie has to say, I do believe the age of the reader will greatly influence the degree to which this book will be of significance. <br />I also found the author's tendency to repeatedly describe the various physical problems overly detailed, although some will find Morrie's candor humorous.<br />The subject matter alone makes for a poignant read, though, and the style is such that it doesn't get overly maudlin.  I would especially recommend it for younger readers who are still caught up in the pressures of making a career and trying to find out what it takes to be happy.
6301966562|5.0|Suspend your disbelief on this one, because it is sci-fi fantasy, not reality. Otherwise, you wouldn't be able to count the \\"goofs\\" with all your fingers and toes when it comes to what the computer, Edgar, can do.<br />Once suspended, however, you can settle back and really enjoy this love story with a twist. You can almost believe that a computer is capable of falling in love.<br />The sound track is fabulous. I especially enjoyed the cello-computer duo. The piece is excellent. It starts with Bach's Minuet in G, converts it to 4/4 time (like Lover's Concerto), then metamorphoses it into a Baroque-style contrapuntal piece a la Pachelbel. It almost brought tears.<br />I've looked everywhere to rent this movie but to no avail. And as much as I love it, I couldn't bring myself to spend [the money]. But I did buy a good used copy from Amazon and it plays fine. I just wish they would make a DVD version with a Dolby 5.1 sound mix.
B00005JKBC|5.0|Having been a long time fan of 3 days of the Condor, I was very excited when I saw this movie's trailer for the first time. The movie is great, a little confusing the first time you see it, since the most recent scene in the movie was in something like 1979. So if you think that it is happening in the present, it is not.<br />Told through a series of flashbacks, as well as a quick-paced front-story, the movie has a great flow to it.<br />The soundtrack is simply amazing. I am so glad that I got a DTS as well as DD reciever. This movie makes it worth it. If you like spy movies, Robert Redford, or Brad Pitt, you will like this movie.
014028009X|3.0|I can understand why people raved about this book. I did enjoy it. I read it in one sitting one rainy afternoon. Fielding is a good writer. She devised really good characters who had some depth. I was particularly impressed with how clearly and consistently she was able to create Bridget. The author's voice didn't sneak through at all, and that is harder to do in an novel than many realize. <br />I found I liked Bridget. She was self effacing, introspective, and not as whiny as the lead character in Arabella Weir's book, &quot;Does My Bum Look Big In This&quot; (which I have also reviewed).  Her concerns around diet, her love life, her job, and her relationship with her parents were things I could relate to. <br />The thing I found was a letdown was that the book wasn't as funny as I had heard. I also found that it was somewhat predictable. Despite that, I'm glad I read the book, and if you haven't read it, it's worth picking up a used copy. I like Bridget and I'm interested in her enough that I'll read the sequel.
B00005JKCF|5.0|I went to this film with high expectations and was blown away! It still feels like I dreamt that they made this movie so good! The casting was great. I'm so glad they didn't throw in the latest teen whose hot at the time to help sell the movie. Tobey Maguire is very believable and gives a powerful performance as both Peter Parker and Spiderman. Spidey's suit for the most part is unchanged, thank god, and didn't go the Batman movie route! Dafoe is excellent as the Green Goblin. Both halves of the movie-the origin and the scenes as Spider-Man are very exciting and are given equal time. The origin allows enough time for Peter to discover his powers and to see how he deals with them. One of the complaints I had is that Spidey's webs are natural and do not come out of web shooters designed like in the comic. This should only be Venom's ability. I also wish they would have stuck with the goblin's original outfit and not the mecha version he has in the film. If it was good enough for its' readers through 40 yrs, it should be good enough for now! Dafoe would have looked dead-on like the goblin with the green mask and pointy ears! I thought that's why he was hired! The action scenes were incredible. As in the trailers, the swinging through the city scenes are amazing and are worth the price of admission along with the aerial battles with Spidey and the Goblin on his glider! I honestly wasn't expecting the fights to be so good! Some fights were almost too brutal, but awesome. Spoiler: When I saw Spidey dodge flying razor pumpkin bombs, and later have his mask blown apart, I knew this movie had already outdone itself! Spidey's signature moves and classic flagpole acrobatics from the cartoon are all there! I also saw Ebert's review and was expecting thumbs up! He complained that the CGI action sequences looked too fake, when he gives Iron Monkey(great film) thumbs up even though the wires are clearly visible! X-Men was great, this blows it away! I would have liked to have seenthose characters in their comic costumes, especially Wolverine. But the makers felt it looked too ridiculous. This movie had the costumes, and proved that it could work! The reason I went to see this movie is because I knew that Sam Raimi was behind it and he exceeded my expectations! This movie would have made money no matter what, because it's Spider-Man. Heck, Jason X is making money! The reason Raimi's version of Spider-Man is making so much money is because it's actually GOOD! Face it folks,Hollywood doesn't usually make films like Raimi's Spider-Man. This is as good as it gets!!!
B00005RDSM|4.0|When I was a little tyke of 3, my mother took me to a drive-in theater in Los Angeles to see Disney's Peter Pan.  Although I had a three-year old's attention span, Mom said I was fascinated by the music and visuals.<br />I debated buying one of Disney's newer movies like Atlantis, or The Emperor's New Groove, but when I saw the Special Edition of Peter Pan, my decision was made easier.<br />My 4-year old boy immediately tried prying the shrink-wrap off of the DVD after it arrived at our home.  He had seen all of the trailers for Return to Neverland, so he recognized Peter Pan right away!<br />My son was captivated by this wonderful classic.  What's not to like about it?  Great songs (\\"You Can Fly\\", and the mildly annoying \\"Following the Leader\\"), characters to whom he could relate (John and Michael, plus the Lost Boys), magic, fairies, mermaids, and pirates -- what else could a boy ask for?  My son actually sat still for the ENTIRE movie.  This was an all time first!<br />Parts of this movie would never have made it out of the editing room in today's hyper-sensitive and politically correct environment.  The segments with the Indians portrays them with a classic stereotype that comes across as mildly offensive and uncomfortable today.  After all, I don't think Native Americans use words like \\"ugh\\" and \\"how.\\"  Plus, the references to them as \\"red men\\" would make many people cringe today.<br />An earlier reviewer mentioned that his daughter did not like Peter Pan.  That does not surprise me.  Women are painted with broad stereotypes in this movie, from jealousy and fickleness, to being helpless.  This is a movie that will definitely appeal to boys, but may leave the little girls longing for Mulan or The Little Mermaid.  Parents may want to consider this.<br />In spite of these shortcomings, this DVD has launched itself to the top of our play list at home, along with Iron Giant and Titan AE.
B00005JKCF|5.0|I've waited for so long for a movie to made about spidey, and it was worth the wait. Great story, great action , and great special effects. I have to say this movie far passes x-men, which i thought was very good. I can't wait for the sequel.
0440213525|2.0|I don't think Grisham really thought too much when he wrote this book.  I can't specifically discuss the many lapses of logic in the story line without giving away the plot.  Suffice it to say that I found the story that Grisham wove to be most unrealistic, and frankly, downright silly.  He paints Mark as a clever, wise beyond his years 11-year-old, yet some of Mark's reasoning towards the end of the book is weak even for a typical 11-year-old.  He paints Reggie as a woman who is wise in the ways of the world, yet she makes errors of judgment that in the real world would get her disbarred, and probably land her in jail.<br />All in all, a big disappointment.
B00005JKDR|5.0|\\"Monsters Inc.\\" is a movie that I would have never seen if I wasn't dragged to it. From the first few minutes of this film I was captivated and immediately knew that it would be a classic. This is easily the best animated film of 2001 and is so good that it can be compared to some live action movies. <br /> The plot of this Pixar animation is very fun. In a world where monsters live their lives just like humans do here on Earth, they get their energy sources in a very peculiar fashion. When it is nighttime the monsters go into these portal type things and sneak into childrens' rooms through their closets. When the child screams, that is just a fraction of the monsters' energy. But when a little girl comes into the monsters' world, Mike and Sulley, the two main characters, are in a panic to get the girl back. Thus is one of the funniest animations that has ever come out of the Pixar Studios.<br /> The voices, music, and computer animation that went into the making of this film were superb. Voices such as John Goodman's and Billy Crystal's will make you smile. The musical score is wonderful and makes this film even more enjoyable. As usual with all Pixar films the plot is very good and has its meanings. <br /> This is definitely worth buying when it comes out in September. Whether or not you have seen this film in the theaters this is a DVD must have. I strongly recommend this film to anybody that likes the work of Pixar Studios and/or is looking for a feel good comedy. This is a film that will be a classic and that should not be missed.<br />Happy Viewing!
B00000AFHM|1.0|Belle and Sebastian may be the \\"Darlings of indy-rock\\" to those haughty critics and lyrical poissures, but this is the most astounding example of spineless and blithe music that has come out in recent years.  With softly plucked stringed instruments and brushed drumming, the music is about as ineffective and empty as the vocals.  Perhaps the lyrics might be fascinating, but there is absolutely no strong aspect of this band to propel you through this album.  Instead, the listener is forced to flounder through this aimless and uninspired album solely by the power of their own need to be \\"hip.\\"  <br />The astronomical rise in popularity of Belle and Sebastian is particularly stunning because their lyrics are about as spineless and uninteresting as the rest of their music is.  Perhaps they are shooting at the lyrical elite out there, but the actual relevance and effectiveness of their lyrics is not at all apparent to this reviewer.  Instead, they appear to fill their album with sly winks and clever nods that only they understand, leaving the listener outside the bubble...and perhaps this is why the indy \\"elite\\" so desperately want to like them.  Unfortunately, if they ever manage to break into this bubble they will find that these lyrics are about as interesting as a indycized Smashmouth.  It is astounding when the one song on this album that has any musical value (\\"A Summer Wasting\\") is so lyrically pathetic that it remains as unlistenable as the rest of the album.<br />In the end, just making it through the first song is a chore, let alone the entire album.  With absolutely lifeless instrumentation and self-absorbed lyrics there is absolutely nothing that makes listening to this album a redeeming activity.  Perhaps Belle and Sebastian have slipped into the indy-elite, but to sell-out to this ridiculous notion is pathetic considering the caliber of this band.  ...
B000007MVX|5.0|This is the concept album of all concept albums. Essentially one long song, briefly interrupted near the middle with a surrealistic morality play (THE HAIR WHO LOST HIS SPECK-I-TICK-ALS), Mr. Anderson and the lads explore death and the subsequent journey through the afterlife. Pausing only briefly to cash in their memories, take up their required time in Hell, and back in the cosmic loop for another go around.<br />The music is brilliant if somewhat dark in nature. This album is definately a product of the early 70's, but to my mind it still holds up as one of the bands' finest achievements. If you like this work, you must also check out NIGHTCAP, a compilation album which contains the earlier 'Chateau D'Isaster Tapes' which contains the original versions and concepts for many of these songs.
B00005YXZH|1.0|I have been a fan of Wilco for that last several years, and am disappointed in the direction of the new CD (Yankee Hotel Foxtrot).  The music was predictable, monotonous and at best &quot;painful&quot; to listen to.  I experienced new levels of tolerance, while attempting to listen to the CD.
B00005RHGK|1.0|I saw this movie in the theater a couple of weeks after it was first released.  The theater was almost completely deserted.It started off well... but when straight down hill after that.  Characters in these movies always do dumb things, right?  These kids do so many stupid things that you don't feel sorry for their fate anymore.Maybe it's me, but I feel that the characters should have some control over the outcome of the film.  It becomes apparent just over half way through the movie that there is no way to kill the monster, who not only drives the fastest truck you've ever seen but can also fly.There are so many holes that are not explained in the script.  A few are expected.  But this was ridiculous.  How does the old, seer woman know what she knows. Most importantly what does it mean to the kids who are being hunted by the creature.  She was just a way to get part of the story out without having to shoot more film.I have since warned people in the theater to see other movies instead. Now, I warn you innocent reader.  Watch anything but Jeepers Creepers.
B00005U18E|5.0|When I bought this movie, I didn't expect much. I just wanted to have a VHR which I could replay to kill time from time to time. But it turned out to be one of my favorite titles. If you liked Notting Hill, chances are you will love Bridget Jones's Diary too.
0345448898|4.0|This series is incredibly well done.  It is much darker than Harry Potter, but it satisfies on the same level.  The goodies and the baddies aren't always easy to label, and there are surprising and sad twists and turns of the plot.  There are also some interesting theological questions to think about without putting forth a religious ideology of any kind, and all this is tied up in a rip-snorting good story about people we'd love to know.  <BR>    Orson Scott Card's \\"Ender's Game\\" and \\"Ender's Shadow\\" are good in this way also.  Happy reading!
B00005JKCF|5.0|I knew i would be good, but I had no idea it would be great.Despite all the nay sayers I knew Toby was te perfect choice to portray Peter. One must remember he is not a Clark Kent or a Bruce Wayne,or even a Scot Summers. He is the must human out of al the super heros. Defoe was all very good as the Green Goblin. Kirsten was good as well (believe me I had my doubts). But J. Johna Jamson was perfect!!! He was my favorite partof the movie. The action was simply jaw droping. In the fair scene, when you see Norman on the glider in the distance I felt like I was emersed in Steve Ditko and Stan Lee's world. This was flat out the best movie I have seen all year (execpt for Black Hawk Down and Beautiful Mind). For fans of Spiderman or any comic fan(yes, even die- hard DC people)you will love this movie. Kids who grew up on the Fox cartoon will enjoy it as well.For people who don't know the charcters you will think it is OK. I can't wait to see the other Marvel movies ( X- men 2, daredevil, hulk, and the sequel to this) Oh yeah is it better then Batman 1, (bob kane's creation is my favorite comic) I'm not sure, but it's pretty damn close!
0316776963|1.0|I bought the book with much anticipated expectation. Its reviews promised a funny-can't-put-down-must-read-book. <BR>All I can say is that I read it. Now I want a refund so I can buy something REALLY FUNNY. And belive me, I LOVE DARK HUMOR. But this felt short. If your readers really want to read  A FUNNY BOOK, READ &quot;e&quot; by Matt Beaumont or any of the three books by Margot Kaufman. Now THOSE are funny!
0440133688|5.0|The zany humor highlights the amazing ability of Shem to create believable charactors.  I read this book once a year whether I need it or not.  I would suggest anyone, especially in the medical field, read this book.
0792151712|4.0|...there was NO WIND at all that night, not even a hint of a breeze. You have to have wind to have \\"wind chill.\\"  Survivors have commented how the ocean was still as a pond, no moon, the water black.  There were survivors who managed to get out of the water and crawl up on over-turned lifeboats.<br />Also, I have heard over and over about the bad dialogue in this movie.  Some of the dialogue is based on actual reports of what was said on this ship.  For example:  Mr. Gugenheim (sp?) rebuffs the life jacket offered him by saying \\"No thank you, we are dressed in our best and are prepared to go down like gentlemen.  Bad dialogue you say?  Well it was reported by eye witnesses/survivors that Mr. Gugenheim actually did say that before he went down with the ship.  Some people today cannot conceive of a time when people actually had enough class to get dressed in their best tuxedo to face their own death.<br />This movie tells the actual, factual Titanic voyage and sinking. If you watch the older movie \\"A Night To Remember,\\" you will see alot of the same things because these things really happened.  The only thing fictional are the central fictitious characters, Rose, Jack, etc., and I do have some criticism of Rose's character especially.  A girl of her social standing, who acted and talked like she did, smoking, swearing, threatening to jump from the ship, posing nude for a picture, probably would have been committed to an insane asylum in 1912.  There was way too much profanity especially at the beginning of this movie.  It was like being assaulted.<br />Read up on the Titanic disaster before you pass judgment on this movie.  If you can get past the profanity at the beginning, and know that Rose is really a fictitious character out of James Cameron's imagination, you are watching a true story about a luxury ship that sank on its maiden (first) voyage across the Atlantic, a ship about which someone at that time supposedly quipped, \\"God himself couldn't sink.\\"<br />One last thing, remember the guy dressed in white who rode the ship down on the railing of the stern with Rose and Jack?  He was either a cook or baker, and he supposedly got stinking drunk, and survived through the night to be rescued.  If you know the little details of the Titanic disaster, this movie will be much more interesting to you.
B000065V3M|5.0|Tim Burton takes a most affectionate look at oddball director Ed Wood in this movie, and there's much to recommend it. It's shot in lustrous black-and-white, and in this day and age using black-and-white film effectively takes no small talent. There are some absolutely remarkable performances: Johnny Depp gets to show off his formidable acting range yet again, Martin Landau absolutely CHANNELS Bela Lugosi ... and in one pleasantly surprising scene Vincent D'Onofrio plays Orson Wells to startling effect. Perhaps what I like most about this film is how Ed Wood is depicted as a director or insurmountable enthusiasm: No matter what pitfalls or tragedies bedevil the production of his films, he maintains a charming optimism that makes him impossible to dislike. And he looks good in angora, too.
B0000013G9|5.0|After the unexpected success of their first CD OOOOOOOHHH....ON THE TLC TIP, people were wondering if TLC could rise to the occasion the next time around. Well, they didn't. They SURPASSED it with CRAZYSEXYCOOL, which won a Grammy in 1996 for Best R&B Album By A Duo or Group, and sold 10 million copies. They left the tomboyish image behind and presented themselves as mature young ladies, and became the biggest selling female trio in music history (as far as albums go...the Supremes still hold the record for most singles by a female trio). From the time you hear the mournful toots of a trumpet and T-Boz's sultry alto vocals croon \\"Oh wha, oh wha, oh wha\\" on the first smash single from this CD, \\"Creep\\" (another Grammy winner in 1996 for Best R&B Performance by a Duo or Group), you're hooked, and it only gets better as it goes on. <br />You can listen to this CD all the way through and not find a bad cut in the bunch. The use of samples are at a minimum, unlike OOOOOOOHHH...ON THE TLC TIP, which relied heavily on them. For example, \\"Creep\\" used the Slick Rick hit \\"Hey Young World\\" as a base for the song, but it is cleverly disguised, so you can barely tell a sample is being used. Mixing old school R&B, new jack swing, hip-hop, gospel and funk hits the mark on CRAZYSEXYCOOL. I loved everything on it, my favorites being the aforementioned \\"Creep\\", \\"Kick Your Game\\", \\"Case Of the Fake People\\", \\"Diggin' On You\\", the red-hot \\"Red Light Special\\", the thought-provoking, award-winning smash \\"Waterfalls\\" (why can't I get the image of TLC standing on water out of my mind?), the funky \\"If I Were Your Girlfriend\\" (T-Boz does an excellent job on this remake of the Prince classic), \\"Switch\\" and \\"Sumthin' Wicked This Way Comes\\". No doubt this CD is already a classic, and will continue to be. This CD is one that should be in every household. T-Boz, Left Eye (R.I.P. Lisa, we love you) and Chilli will forever be CRAZYSEXYCOOL. TLC forever!
0345448898|4.0|Don't be put off by the comparisons to Harry Potter or the awards that it has won in the Young Readers community.  This is an excellent series; both thought-provoking and entertaining.  The characters are well developed, and the premise is refreshingly original.  While the books are certainly suitable for younger readers, more mature readers can pick up on the philisophical and theological undertones that your average child might miss.  It's nice to read an engaging fantasy that is not a Tolkien or Jordan knock-off.  It starts a tad slow, but don't give up.  By the middle of the first book, you'll be hooked!

B00005JKEC|3.0|Before anyone jumps all over me, I want it notated, and understood, that I have been a Denzel Washington fan, since his stellar work on St. Elsewhere! Period! And there have been so many, many times this actor has been &quot;passed over&quot;, (i.e. performance in &quot;Malcomb X&quot;, only ONE &quot;instance&quot;), that they become too numerous to mention. And he once again, gave a &quot;knockout performance&quot; ( another instance, &quot;Hurricane&quot;) HERE, and actually &quot;brought-up the level of this entirefilm, with THIS PERFORMANCE!However, THAT being the case, he did NOT deserve The Academy Award THIS YEAR, for THIS PERFORMMANCE! That belongs to Russell Crowe, and should have gone there THIS YEAR!You cannot &quot;right the wrongs done priorly, since film began, by doing THIS!&quot; Halle Berrie, DID have her's coming, and I am joyous for HER, as much as I was nearly, for Sidney Poitier, who HAS DEFINITELY had THIS AWARD coming for seeming &quot;centuries&quot;!THAT &quot;being the case here&quot;, Denzel Washington DID a tremendous job, on an&quot;over-extended, vastly already gone over terrain, of &quot;good cop, gone veryBad-&quot;Lieutant&quot;, etc. etc. etc......&quot;This was no &quot;ground-breaking movie&quot;, not even in it's subtext, and noir'.Russell Crowe DID DO THAT, THIS YEAR, in &quot;A Beautiful Mind&quot;. HE deserved it THIS YEAR, and due to an Academy that was so obviously, trying to make &quot;restitution for ALL their &quot;prior sins&quot; (and *ord knows, THEY HAVE!) by doing THIS, they &quot;cheapened the award, and it's meaning,( BEST performance by an actor, THIS YEAR, NOT &quot;career-spanning&quot;, which is what they did HERE!) and thusly, and unfairly,&quot;cheated another man, who just happened to be white&quot;; of HIS WELL-EARNED ACHIEVEMENT, THIS YEAR!!THAT was a mistake, and sadly, in a movie &quot;over-all&quot;; lacking in merit, of it's own, actually &quot;hurt the very real genious, of THIS ACTOR, THIS YEAR!!THIS was Russell Crowe's year, and HE &quot;was robbed, in like manner!&quot;.Sorry, Denzel, NOT THIS YEAR!!N.L.N.
B00001OH1S|5.0|This soundtrack is incredible, one of my favorites. Bill Conti, a relatively well known composer who deals mostly in soundtracks (he also did the Rocky theme/soundtrack) is showing a side of his music that I for one, didnt know existed(and I certainly hope he continues in this newfound vein!) The atmosphere is very classy, intelligent, and relaxed, very like the film itself. 'Black&amp;WhiteX5, the Wasis Diop tracks, and the Nina Simone song &quot;sinnerman&quot; are wonderful, and although i prefer the older, original version of windmills of your mind, sting's rendition is very nice. very modern-jazzish, and very sting in that its very soft and flowing.
B00005YUPO|4.0|I thought twice about purchasing this DVD after reading some of the reviews on this site; however, I am glad that I bought it.  While I personally prefer the Baby Mozart DVD, my son (5 months) appears to enjoy Baby Bach just as much.  Some reviewers have criticized this DVD because it heavily features the Baby Einstein creator's children but my son just loves watching those two little girls.  He smiles and laughs whenever they appear onscreen.  Seeing his reaction to them, I almost wish that they were featured MORE.  Although I would not recommend this DVD quite as highly as Baby Mozart, prospective purchasers should not let bad reviews scare them away.  Each child is different and yours may love Baby Bach as much as mine has!
B00005QIPH|5.0|Yeah, they are so very obviously influenced by vintage CGGB era rock.  So what?  Is CBGB's turning out anything these days anyways?  LIsten, just forget the Velvet Underground comparisons.  The Velvet's sound was drenched in grugs.  The Strokes sound is fueled only by the love of music itself, which is in itself highly commendable.  With the era of proto-punk long, long over, the Strokes sound is a breath of fresh air.  Standing alone, they become free to abandon all pretention and play what they want to play, and what they want to play is the purest, most nearly innocent strain of rock'n roll you'll ever hear.  So just forget what you've been told, forget what you've been taught, close your eyes, and listen to the vibe which is so good.  <br />In short, buy this CD.  It's good.
B00003CXI1|4.0|Harry Potter is a phenomenon around the world. That is for sure. The motion picture of the first book of the series is a very promising attempt of the story, attending every bit of the details. However, for the book lovers, they might feel less satisfied in a way that not all the materials included in the book were shown. This could be understood in a way that a featured film for mostly kids can't be too long or it would lose the concentration of the audience. Nonetheless, for people who really love the book, this might not be as good as expected. On the technical side, the Quidditch match is well filmed and presented, but for other parts of the movie, like the ogre attack and Fluffy, the level of effects is not as promising. It was said that in the next movie, ILM will be responsible for the special effects, hopefully it would be better. For the actors playing the main characters, they are still very green, although Hermione did a very good job in being a very difficult girl. More development could be given to the actors, but since this is the first Harry Potter movie, it is assumed that they would become better and better in the up coming ones. Overall speaking, this movie is a good pass time for all.
B0000636UN|2.0|This album has been heralded as the &quot;cheerful counterpart&quot; to Ms. Crow's eponymous second album. Cheerful as it may be, a counterpart it is not. Witless and utterly lacking Crow's trademark irony, I cannot warn too strongly against the purchase of this album.  <br />Perhaps this album suffers from over-collaboration. With guest appearances by Lenny Kravitz, Don Henley, and Stevie Nicks (among others), this album seems like a bad Sheryl Crow-tribute album, with Crow making a half-hearted imitation of and appearance as herself. All this resulting in a bizarre mixture of pop culture antecedents, with some of the songs sounding like bad Beatles redux or like the tremendously strange song &quot;Lucky Kid,&quot; particularly odd since it sounds nearly identical to &quot;Paranoid&quot; by Shirley Manson and her band &quot;Garbage.&quot;<br />Admittedly, Sheryl Crow's albums are never consummate masterpieces, this can be overlooked, especially considering her numerous songwriting credits from &quot;If It Makes You Happy&quot; to &quot;My Favorite Mistake.&quot; One can even overlook the fact that she nearly butchered Bob Dylan's &quot;Mississippi&quot; on 1998's _Globe Sessions_, but this current offering is beyond all reasonable condonation. Her second album (_Sheryl Crow_) remains her strongest effort to date.
B0000636UN|5.0|God, I love this woman!  She has become such a huge presence in rock music over the past 10 years.  Although she's terrific on her own, her new found alliances (Don Henley, Lenny Kravitz, Stevie Nicks, etc...) make her even better!  I think the thing I love most about Sheryl is that she's a contemporary artist with classic rock sensibilities.  I'll be listening to this one for quite a long time (as well as her previous works).
0783241569|5.0|In an act of good faith, \\"Notting Hill\\" begins with the awesome Elvis Costello singing the song \\"She\\".  This would imply that the movie is all about how Hugh (and you) is going to fall in love with Julia Roberts.  Not so fast.  Julia is hardly the perfect object of desire here that she is in her earlier films.  She's shallow, and flighty, and has a shotgun temper (okay, okay, she's still got that great smile, but bear with me here for a moment).  So this movie breaks one of my first rules of romantic comedies: I *must* fall in love with the girl.  But like another of my all-time favourites, \\"Say Anything...\\", it expertly portrays how the boy in question falls for said girl (even if I can't), and makes me believe that it is not only possible for him to do so, but unstoppable despite the odds against him.<br />So what's wrong with Julia here?  Well, let's face it: she just doesn't turn in a very good performance.  She seems to be trying to prove her character right when she says, \\"I told you I couldn't act!\\"  She has not the low-key wit or stuffy self-deprecating sense of humour to pull of the decidedly British script.  But the irony is that no one else on the planet could have played this role, or at least played it as convincingly.  Her character, Anna Scott, is the Julia Roberts of the \\"Notting Hill\\" parallel universe: a commercially hyper-successful actress who longs not only for respectability, but also trucks full of attention.  Anna only comes out of her shell when William pronounces her \\"heavenly\\", a trick I've seen Ms. Roberts fall for in dozens of interviews.<br />Now, I admit that Julia does deserve all the credit in the world for at least being willing to poke fun at her persona.  A telling scene around a dinner table involves a sorriest sap contest for the last brownie.  Anna tells of her ten years of dieting and her plastic surgeries, all in an attempt to postpone the \\"day, not long from now when [her] looks will go, they'll find out [she] can't act and[she'll] become a sad middle-aged woman who looks a bit like someone who was famous for a while.\\"  To the script's credit, her dinner companions don't fall for this sad tale (one tempered, minutes before, by her own admission that her last film paid her $15 million), but for at least one moment, Julia's own off-screen fears (or at least as I imagine them to be) are laid flat on the table.<br />The film works for me, mainly, because Hugh Grant plays the 'boy' role.  Grant and screenwriter Richard Curtis have worked together three times by now (\\"Four Wedding and a Funeral\\" and \\"Bridget Jones's Diary\\" being their other collaborations), and every time the outcome has been pure gold.  Grant is an expert at portraying this kind of character: witty and plain, genuine and straightforward, stumbling but elegant.  In the early scenes with Julia, where his William Thacker appears to want to jump over the counter and maul the famous celebrity who's just stepped into his little travel book shop but can't because of his British reserve, he is charming and vulnerable all at once.  And I think Hugh is the only actor working today who could respond to a question like, \\"Can I stay a bit longer?\\" with \\"Stay forever,\\" and not make it sound false or melodramatic.  Coming from his mouth, it sounds heartbreaking and real.<br />As for Curtis, he's managed a deft and funny script that puts a new spin on the boy-meet-girl/boy-loses-girl/(spoiler omitted) genre, while throwing in some slick Hollywood satire to help it all go down easier (he's fashioned a hilarious junket sequence ('Horse & Hound') that trumps anything a later Roberts film, the bland \\"America's Sweethearts\\", came up with).  He captures true sentiment, even through such an unbelievable and fantastic situation as this one.  And just like I wouldn't mind seeing Hugh Grant in this kind of role over and over again (with slight variations), if Richard Curtis would spend the rest of his days writing witty screenplays wherein Yanks fall in love with Brits who are egged on by a group of eccentric friends, I'd be terribly happy.  Curtis himself has noted the obvious resemblance between \\"Notting Hill\\" and \\"Four Weddings and a Funeral\\"; let's hope he forgets the repetition next time he sits down at the keyboard.<br />Similarities aside, the background of \\"Notting Hill\\" is populated with a number of interesting and noteworthy performances.  Tim McInnerny and Gina McKee play William's best friends; he's the world's worst cook, she's consigned to a wheelchair.  Their love is palpable and endearing.  Hugh Bonneville plays a sad-sack stockbroker friend.  Emma Chambers is William's nervous sister.  And of course, the wonderful Rhys Ifans nearly steals the show as Spike.  Sure he gets to spend a lot of time wandering around in his underpants (not to mention a memorable little moment in a scuba suit), but Ifans never goes over the top to mine laughs from the character.  Far from it.  He's low-key, almost droll in his portrayal of the man who Will casually describes as little more than a \\"masturbating Welshman\\".<br />Where it was an act of good faith in the beginning, meant to endear itself to the audience when they didn't know what was coming, the use of Elvis Costello again singing \\"She\\" near the end perfectly sums up the movie: \\"Me, I'll take her laughter and her tears / And make them all my souvenirs / For where she goes I've got to be / The meaning of my life is she\\".  It's a sappy sentiment, but following a movie that revels in its own status as such high-grade sap, it's also a perfect sentiment.
B00005JKCF|3.0|After waiting in anticipation to see this movie and hearing how great this movie was I finally got to see it. At the end of the movie I had to double check if this was the same movie everybody was talking about. the special effects were cheesy! come on atleast put some effort into trying to make it look real. How could you make the jumping from building to building scene look fake. Hello! Matrix pulled it off why couldn't it be done in this movie just as cool? The only cool special effects parts that seemed decent was when spidey was swinging through NYC buildings and the Green goblin looked all around good. The bad part that I found with the green goblin was for a high tech battle suit why was there mesh where his mouth is? in anycase the spidey outfit looked cool in the special effects part but, the parts when it was an actual person wearing it made me feel nostalgic of the cheesy 70's spidey outfit on TV. The acting was great from all the characters except for one minor detail. Spidey has a dual persona which was failed to capture in the movie. A geeky dork as Peter Parker which Tobey got dead on but failed in his performance as the heroic,witty and sarcastic sense of humor as Spider Man. I still felt his geeky persona when he had the spidey outfit on. Might as well not wear the mask at all. If not for the excellent story line nothing would have saved this movie from being an utter flop. I like the new twist and changes they added that deviated from the comic book, really brilliant stuff... What happen after Evil Dead? I got some eerie sense of Darkman and Army of darkness in this movie. Which were hammy but it kinda went with those movies. I say this movie is a matinee and after the hype dies down must people will agree.

B00005UW7V|4.0|I just finished viewing this for the first time, as felt as deeply disturbed about the movie as I was deeply moved to think about it. And then it hit me.<br />That's what Stanley Kubrick used to do to me when I first saw his movies in the 70s!<br />And then there were the similarity in themes. The Star-child at the end of 2001 is a resurrected David Bowman, representing a resurrected mankind.<br />The scenes with David (in A.I.) sitting in a replication of his \\"parents'\\" house, alone, observed and then approached by alien-like robots of the future.<br />And Dr. Strangelove -- the disturbing world comes to an end theme (albeit handled with profound humor).<br />The scenes in Rouge City and the bars frequented by the delinquents in Clockwork Orange.<br />Kubrick was all throughout this movie.<br />And for me that means it was disturbing. But not necessarily in a bad way. Even perhaps in the best way. Yet, I cannot deny it was disturbing.<br />At the same time, Spielberg has his imprint all over the movie too.<br />The innocent little boy faced with both great wonder and awareness of the most profound horror about life.<br />The boy looking toward a light-filled image. (Remember the famous scene in Close Encounters. And other Spielberg movies.)<br />Of course, the special effects are top rate, another Spielbergian fingerprint.<br />The movie delivered in a lot of ways. From the opening sequence I wanted to see New York City submerged under water. But at the same time I wanted it to deliver perhaps the impossible -- making David into a real boy that his \\"mother\\" loves. The ending is bittersweet. But perhaps the message is that miracles do not happen; only in fairy tales. This seems much more Kubrickian than Spielberg, at least classic Raiders-Spielberg. But I had hoped perhaps the future robots could somehow resurrect humans in soul as well as body. To do so for one day, and then have them die is Kubrick.

It doesn't deliver the emotion I -- we -- really want.<br />Again, which is OK for a Kubrick film. And perhaps OK for a teenager perhaps too caught up in his philosophical inner dialogues.

It is too early for me to gauge the effect of this movie in that regard. But I think it will.<br />And for that I have to give his high marks.<br />And I do.<br />But it is still disturbing.

B00005AXEL|4.0|If you loved Stevie once in your lifetime you'll love Stevie always.  I am one of them.  I've loved everything about her for 25 years.  I am so happy to see that Stevie has decided to dust off her chiffon and return with a remarkable set.  I lost we had lost her after Street Angel.<BR>I believe part of her new success has been partnering with contemporary artists (Sheryl Crow particularly).  At the same time I think many Nicks followers will hear hidden strains of The Chain, Bella Donna, Edge of Seventeen, and Landslide throughout.  My one wish is that the guest vocals of Macy Gray, Sheryl Crow, and Sarah McLaughlin could be heard much clearer.
B000062TU1|5.0|Wow I loved this movie it was delightful and i'd see it again and againa and so on. It was great for all ages.  Even people who did'nt like Harry Potter enjoyed it. Thats how great it was
B00003CXI1|4.0|I thought the movie was the bomb! the only reason that I gave it four stars was because they added some stuff from book two, like nerly hedless nick being dissapointed about not being in the hedless hunt, and they left some stuff out, or changed, like norbert. In the movie it is Harry, Draco, Ron, and Hermione who goes into the woods, but in the book, it is Harry, Draco, Hermione, and Neville. Slight change, but still. I thought that the actors were awasome! It looked like a lot of fun to do the movie! I cant wait for Nov. 16 for the second one to come out! I have read all of the books, about seven times each, and I could say them backwards in my sleep! They are some of the best books in the world! Those of you who say that witchcraft is bad, it is a religon, saying that is almost like saying god is bad! A different  way of thinking of things, huh? If you think it wastes paper, that comes from trees, that make oxygen, 75% of all the oxygen comes from plankton, in the water. I am a HUGE fan of Harry, and I believe in Whitchcraft. My friend is Wiccan. She is awasome! She made me levitate! It was cool! It is amazing that we can look magic in the face, but not relize it! It is truly amazing! Next time, you think you loose you keys, they might just be shrinking! So stop looking over it!
6304946597|4.0|The first time I saw this movie was on a firebase in Vietnam of all places. The times were \\"anti-war\\" when the movie was made (1970)George C. Scott gave the performance of his life in this movie and it is probably the best mixture of war and character study I have ever seen. The movie protrayed Patton as a war monger which is a misinterpretation of his real nature. He was a General a true warrior and new his military history from the dawn of time. In the beginning of the movie he takes over III Corps which was in diseray from the humiliateing loss at Kasserine Pass. He HAD to be tough to get those men back in fighting condition. Near the end of the film when his 3rd Army is racing accross Europe you can see that although his men feared him and some thought him crazy they wanted no one else leading him. Patton once said that at the end of every war we have been involved with, we have always left something undone. He was right and we fought a \\"cold war\\" with Russia for 50 years. If you read the book that the movie was \\"based on\\" you'd find that the amphifious assault that he ordered in Sicily was a brillant tactical menuver that caught the Germans off guard and probably saved thousands of Americans lives. In the movie he ordered it just to get to Medina before Montgomery. The historical facts are accurate, the acting is superb but the accuracy of Patton ideals are ficion.
0920668372|5.0|A great book as a gift for your Mom.  She'll cry her eyes out, the good kind of cry.<br /><br />Oh, and for all of the nutcases saying this is a book that \\"promotes codependancy\\" or is about incest:  get a life.  To quote Sigmund Freud himself, \\"Sometimes a cigar is just a cigar.\\"  This is a book for kids that has levels that appeal to adults too.  Enjoy it, and tell Mom you love her.
B000065VA1|5.0|Rock on, I've been waiting for these remasters for years. I had planned on selling my original CDs first to come up with the cash to buy the new ones, but time only permitted purchasing first.<br />Since my wallet was not as full as I would like, I had to choose two of the remasters to begin with. I chose &quot;Shaking the Tree&quot; and &quot;So.&quot; What can I say? Wow. I popped in &quot;So&quot; in my 1990 Toyota Corolla with factory speakers, not expecting to hear much until I got home to the good stereo, but wow. I was hearing things that I had never heard before. There was more depth, more texture, and more layers than I had ever heard on a PG album before. Now I'm listening to it on a ProLogic II system, and it's blowing my mind.<br />I hate cardboard cases, so I opted for the non-limited editon jewel case versions. What's the deal with the limited edition cardboard anyway? Silly marketing ploy, if you ask me.<br />Next week I should have enough to pick up the rest...
B000000H57|4.0|Although I do enjoy this album, musically at least, I seem to find it rather obvious by the introductions of the band members and the ridiculous lyrics that Type O Negative is creating a parody of themselves and every other sappy, oh-so-depressed goth band in existence. They are blatantly in the business to make money, and to enjoy themselves, both of which they do. I don't think anyone can really take this album seriously. That being said, I think that this album is rather good, despite its rather obvious shortcomings. The music is very beautiful and makes great background music to introspection or a get together. Overall, definitely worth purchasing. Just don't get carried away by calling this authentic gothic music.
B00003CX8Y|5.0|Over the years, Disney has had its hits and misses, but Beauty and the Beast surpassed the mark.  The computer animation looks so real.  Disney did a good job with making the story pleasent for young viewers without straying too far from the original plot (which they've done with several other films).  The songs are amazing, the cast is great, and the movie as a whole is excellent.
0553106635|3.0|If you're gonna read this book be prepared for reality.  This is not the usual fantasy story where the good guy beats all odds to win.  Many of the good guys are actually killed during the story (which I found a little strange.  George builds up characters for 1000+ pages then KILLS them... i suppose that's reality though).  And the ending?  Also a little strange.  I confess, I thought it kicked ... how some characters got revenge but still, none of the situations are really tied up at the end of the trilogy.  <BR>If you like kings, queens and knights read this book but don't set yourself up to be completely happy with the ending.

0446608955|5.0|I started off reading this book with the reservation that it would be another sappy teen love story. I was wrong. This book delves into the conscience of Landons character, who is consciously selfish and somewhat shallow by nature but has a hidden depth to him that he doesnt show. Jamie is the catalyst between the boy he was and the great man he becomes. She opens him up to a world where beauty isnt seen in appearance but in heart. A love like this is something we should all experience once in our lives.  Sparks goes beyond the human realm of physical and emotional love and illustrates the pure spirituality love has to offer us.
8478884955|3.0|Aconsejo no prestar demasiada atención a las críticas que se quejan del vocabulario castizo en contraposición al vocabulario americano. No hay prácticamente nada que un lector castellanohablante educado no pueda entender, y el castellano utilizado en el libro es adecuado para la trama.   La traducción en sí, exceptuando algún resbalón con el subjuntivo, es gramaticalmente correcta. No conozco el original en inglés.    El argumento abunda en lo descriptivo, con un ritmo de la acción lento durante casi toda la obra, concentrando la mayor parte del desenlace en los últimos 3 o 4 capítulos. La sensación de desasosiego que algunas críticas mencionan en este sentido es legítima.    En general, la obra es medianamente entretenida y contribuye a adquirir vocabulario.
0441008356|3.0|I was intrigued by the reviews of this novel when it appeared on my recommended list. So much so that I immediately ordered it. The first half was wonderful. I was completely drawn into the plot and could indeed identify with the characters. Some of the ideas presented were interesting and original, and the style reminded me of the wonderful Iain Banks. Some of the ideas were not original however, with a Dan O'Bannon influence clearly showing through (the &quot;frozen&quot; captain for instance).<br />Then everything changed just at the time when it should all have pulled together. It felt as if all those disparate little pieces of plot which had been happily floating around were grabbed and forced into the rather unsatisfactory ending. It was almost as if Mr. Reyolds couldn't really decide how the thing was to end, and just lost a lot of interest.<br />Definately a book of two halves. I will watch out for the next offering.
B0000508U6|5.0|I'm a fan of Travis, but all these people comparing Coldplay to Travis may be putting people off buying the album. Where Travis can at times sound a bit wet, Coldplay sound more passionate and uplifting. <br />This album is sublime and Coldplay were voted the best new band in Britain ( nd deservedly so).<br />However because Coldplay are British, and so are Radiohead does not mean you should compare the two (as many reviewers have). Both are great bands, but share nothing in common musically. <BR>I think the band that most closely resembles Coldplay is Starsailor. So if you like 'Parachutes'I recommend you buy Starsailors 'love is here'.
B00005NWM3|1.0|This cd started out Excellent with &quot;Never Again, How You Remind Me and one other cool song Too Bad.&quot; From then on it went &quot;Down Hill&quot; like a rocket... ! The rest of the songs just drag.You can't wait until they are over.I think the band felt the same way just get it out! Nickelback's other track selections seem like MTV unplugged without any instruments.Chad sings them as though they are paragraphs word from word. A real funeral dirge!Combine Nickebacks 3 Terrific tracks with &quot;Defaults&quot; Wasting My time,Deny and we have some Great music...! I learned the hard way,next time Sample the CD first !
0894803123|5.0|I have tried many ice cream recipe books, but this one is a keeper.  It is well written, recipes are easy to understand and put together.  The ice cream recipes are rich and delicious, flavors are well varied and nothing outrageous that you would be afraid to try.  If you want lower fat, they encourage you to try using more milk and less cream and to experiment.  We have had wonderful results with this.  As far as using raw uncooked eggs in the recipes, we have remedied this by buying pasturized egg substitute (such as egg beaters) and using it in place of raw eggs.  Results are wonderful!
0784011222|3.0|Guilty pleasure. Two words that describe the Rambo trilogy. Who can't enjoy Sylvester Stallone's gigantic larger-than-life Vietnam veteran. He destroys everything and sight and can survive through huge battles. If you're sick of the same old Van Damme or Seagal movies, watch this one. Rambo travels to Afghanistan and saves a ton of people. Too bad Stallone isn't around anymore making movies like this.
B00000G3PA|4.0|As far as blockbuster movies go, this one was A LOT of fun. <br />I read one review from a reviewer who was annoyed that so many people rated things as a '5' when that top rating should be reserved for movies or CDs etc, that we'd all still be talking about 50 years from now. I disagree. Ratings are here to give us a rough idea of how good something is in the scope of today, not in the scope of half a century. <br />That being said, Armageddon earns a four in my book, and for several reasons. Enough people have reiterated the plot so I won't go into that. As for the movie as a whole, yes, it assumes you're looking for a good time and not a real end-of-the-world, religious allegory. But the point that a lot of this movie's bashers are forgetting to take into account is that the movie knows this and does not try to be anything else. It goes all out (WAY to the extreme) to have fun, and for this film, it works. It's big, it's loud, it's grandiose - and it wouldn't have worked any other way. The only reason I take off a star is b/c, yeah, granted, it's definitely not Oscar material (not that the Academy always picks the most deserving films anyway) and the dialogue could have been a little better. And the shot were we get a close look at Affleck's full mouth of capped, sparkling white teeth is really disturbing.<br />For a summer flick - and taking into consideration how much time of the movie's two hours was spent either in a space shuttle or in an action scene - the film does quite a better than average job of at least TRYING to give just about each character a little bit of dimension, which I appreciated. And the effects are great, that goes without saying. <br />But my fav. part of the film was the score - it still gets me every time when the scene with the president's speech comes on and the drillers are getting on the shuttle. Yeah, it's cliched, overdone, and cheesy but who cares? And the scene where Harry is talking to Grace right before he's about to make the ultimate sacrifice? Let's just put it this way - last summer, I didn't go to summer school and I had so little to do, I just watched tv all day. My movie of choice was always Armageddon and even though I ended up watching it maybe more than 30 times back to back, I cried every time. <br />This movie is one of my secret guilty pleasures along with ID4 (which other ppl are coincidently putting down for lack of intelligence, but I thought did a great job for what it was supposed to do) and whenever I want to give my brain a break and just have some fun, a good laugh, and an exhilarating ride, I pop it into the VCR. <br />\\"Get OFF...the...nuclear...warhead.\\" <~ line delivered with a completely straight face. HILARIOUS!! My brother and I still crack up. <BR> <BR>Oh, and Liv Tyler was absolutely gorgeous.
B000001FHV|5.0|It starts off kind of weak, but quickly becomes stellar. Some of these i can listen to over and over. Sort of a mix of Joan Baez, Nirvana, Sparklehorse, and Rusted Root, except completely different.
B00003CXN3|5.0|Especially the kid - Chrisenson. She did an incredible job of portraying the addict, and what one will do to feed the addiction.<br />A well acted flick with enough of a plot albeit convoluted at times.<br />great for a weekend viewing, or a matinee' if still in theatres!
0784011206|4.0|A revolution of sorts when this movie came out. Its release spawned many movies to star a one-man army. Sylvester Stallone stars as John Rambo, a Vietnam veteran trying to look for some of his old buddies. He finds out that they have all passed on and is alone. He strolls into a small Colorado town and a crooked sheriff (Brian Dennehy) doesn't let him stay. He arrests Rambo for defiance and the police beat him up. But, that doesn't fly and Rambo fights back and flees the station. A lot of action and a memorable ending make this movie one to remember.
0767836286|1.0|NO STARS for a EVIL FILM. Not the most original concept.<br />One star for Jeff Bridges. The rest of the film gets a THUMBS DOWN. This is a great example of how media enlightens people to be bad.<BR>The only positive note is for Tim Robbins who gets to stick it to the United States government. ha ha ha ha. <BR>Overall, THIS IS ONE OF THE FEW MOVIES I REGRET HAVING EVER SEEN.
B000063CPL|5.0|Another Maiden live album? Not so fast. This one IS different. The sound is fresh and the energy is oozing out of the songs. I highly recommend this. Mind you I would still do WITHOUT Janick Gers. Yes, he's a great showman, but his playing is terrible. I was also shocked and dismayed when I noticed that he plays Adrian's solo on \\"Hallowed Be Thy Name\\". I know they're trying to keep the solos evenly distributed, but his playing is awful compared to Adrian's. I say either keep him as a rhythm player or not at all. Nevertheless, great album.
B00005K3OT|5.0|My expectations for this movie would be that it would be one of those uplifting but ultimately shallow movies where a predictable and heavy-handed plot would drag the movie along.  I was pleasantly surprised that this movie was far more than I had originally thought it would be.  This movie tells the story of a dull French town which has existed in a tradition of religious piety and colorless humility for centuries.  Only the arrival of Juliette Binoche who opens a chocolate shop can change the town.  Binoche is one of those actresses that seems to radiate an inner beauty in films.  Just watching her is a pleasant experience since she seems so lovely (and not just on a physical level).  At times the plot did seem somewhat predictable, but I fell in love with this movie anyway.  The setting was lovely and I thought that many of the actors were just perfect for their roles, particularly the child actors.  I will admit that the accents were sort of strange, you had real French actors with believable accents interacting with British and American random accents, plus Johnny Depp's Irish accent was a bit off target.  And the voice-overs were heavy-handed, seemingly to explain things in the movie that you'd have to be sleeping through the movie to not have understood.  But I enjoyed this movie and found it genuinely moving and sincere.  I hate reading a review that retells the plot of the movie and spoils it for someone who has never viewed it, so just go out and see this movie and you'll see what I mean!
0805066349|5.0|This book is a very important testament towards the atrocities committed by our government towards the native americans.  The story of the Cheroke's during the Sand Creek Massacre is the part of the book that got to me most.  The way our soldiers mutilated the bodies of the dead native americans was horrible and proves how evil the white man was.  Over all I think everybody should read this book and consider the evidence of how we destroyed many different cultures on the only basis of the fact that they were different from us.  A must read.
B00005Y7AW|5.0|I agree with the comments below about this being the work of a quality singer/songwriter.  The first 8 tracks are my favorites, but everything is good here.  The chord progressions are fresh and creative--the melodies are often surprisingly complex.  I appreciate that the lyrics are intelligent too--but it's the creativity of the music that really gets me.  This CD will endure.
B00005AWMF|5.0|Wow!!  I always wanted to own a Sade cd, but never took the time to buy one until I heard her latest song one night on an episode of Sex in the City.  I would often hear one of her songs at 3am in the morning if I woke up and discovered I had fallen asleep with the radio on, or while shopping in a [retail store]. Finally, I made an effort to get one of her cds.  It's the best music to fall asleep to, and I have even bought a live album of hers since!
0783230079|5.0|I've been loving this movie since I was probably 12 years old, and I still do to this day... It is the epitome of the sweet and touching comedy.  The major theme of the movie is DEFINATELY second chances...<br />Four people are killed when a bus crashes, and their souls become linked to a baby who is born right at the same time.  That baby is to become their chance at doing the things that they never got to do in life, when he grows up (into Robert Downey Jr)-- if they can just get him to cooporate!<br />This movie is sweet.  There is no other word for it.  It is funny, and touching, and SWEET!  I introduced it to a bunch of my friends who'd never even heard of it before, and it was a smash hit with all of them... It's a little cheezy, but oh-so feelgood!  Give it a looksee if you haven't before!
B000063CPL|5.0|Okay...not as good as Live After Death, but still great...I wasnt really sure what to expect. But as soon as I poped it in my cd player on the way home...I was hooked. The intro is quite \\"spooky\\"...I like it a lot because I really like the songs they played. Live After Death sounds so good, but I like a lot of the new songs so...I like Rock In Rio just as much as Live After Death, but if you'r a new comer to Iron Maiden I recommend Live After Death first. Rock In Rio is great for any Iron Maiden Fan!!!<br />UP THE IRONS!
B00005QZ7U|5.0|Moulin Rouge is a WONDERFUL film, if you like music, dance, romance, and a pretty heavy touch of the unusual in your films!  Personally speaking, I loved Moulin Rouge the first time I saw it, and have seen it several times since then... It provides comedy, drama, and one of the most beautiful love stories I've ever seen...<br />One of the biggest complaints I've heard is that it's just too *busy*, particularly in the opening dance scene at the Moulin Rouge.  Believe me, I agree that scene was frenzied, but get through it if you can.  <br />The long and short of it is, this is either a movie that you really like or you really don't... Be forewarned that it is UNLIKE ANYTHING YOU'VE EVER SEEN!  Whether that's a good thing or a bad thing-- well you'll just have to decide for yourself
B000063CPL|5.0|Okay...first of all you either love it or hate it. It all depends on how much you liked the newer songs. But, in my mind Live After Death will always be the best...I still like Rock In Rio though and I cant wait for the dvd on June 10th.<br />UP THE IRONS!
6304696515|5.0|This is a movie that I could easily watch 100 times over... The acting is simply superb.  All of the characters come off so multi-faceted.. Are they good?  Are they bad?  Are they all victims of circumstances?  It's hard to say.<br />I love this movie because it makes me FEEL and it makes me THINK.. Goodness, how it frustrates me, but it does capture me.  It is a really compelling film.<br />I am someone who watches movies for the characters more than the story-- I like to see them, and empathize with them.  If you understand what I mean by that, then you'd probably like this film, because it is driven completely by the characters.  Who they are and what they do determines what happens, and you cannot help but get pulled in.  GREAT GREAT performances by John Malkovich and Glenn Close, as the scheming and manipulative former lovers, and by Michelle Pfeiffer, as the innocent woman they set out to corrupt..
0446310786|5.0|I actually would have given this book more than 5 stars-its wonderfull.i have read this book again and again and have not tired of it.Atticus Finch is one of the most amazing charectors ever wriitten-yes perhaps he's too perfect but it makes me like him more.The morals in this book were subtle and its part of the reading experience to understand and embibe the morals in this book. This is one book I reccomend to everybody....
B00005YW4H|5.0|I'd never heard of Norah Jones prior to seeing her last night (5-6-2002) on the David Letterman Show.  I was blown away with her live performance of &quot;Come Fly Away With Me&quot;.  Norah Jones is a wonderful breath of fresh air amidst a sea of new comers who all have that &quot;same-look-feel-and-sound&quot;.  Nora Jones joins the ranks of Minnie Ripperton, Phoebe Snow, Maria Muldair, Basia and I dare say Carole King.  She's a wonderful performer, whose talent is quite obvious. This album defines &quot;mellow&quot; with &quot;just right&quot; ingredients of jazz, pop and a smidgeon of blues. Ten years from now they'll be referring to this debut album as a classic.
B00003CXTG|2.0|Everything about this movie seemed to have a made up fakeness about it.  The historical inaccuracies were glaring from the beginning. The acting at best was medeocre and the romance was completely ineffective.  Even the much applauded 30 minute battle seemed to be a little to prestine and precise. It looked great, but did not have the grit or edginess to make it feel real.  Michael Bay's MTV style of direction doesn't help this type of movie.  All in all if you want the real Pearl Harbour story, rent &quot;Tora, Tora, Tora&quot; a vastly superior film in all ways.
B00005YW4H|5.0|Whether you're a fan of 112 or D-12, we all can stand to listen to some music once in a while to just kick back and relax. Norah Jones's album, Come Away with Me, is perfect for that. From Blue Note Records, you would expect a strictly jazz album, but in fact, similar to the Blue Break Beats compilations from the same record label, this album contains a mixture of other styles with jazz.<br />In fact, there are signs of country, jazz, soft rock and a little blues found here, so you don't have to worry about hearing the same song over and over again on this album. Those who say that some of her songs sound the same are probably the ones who don't really listen to people like her anyway. If you take a good listen to her covers like \\"Cold Cold Heart\\" and other songs like the title track she wrote, \\"Feelin' the Same Way\\", and of course, \\"Don't Know Why\\", you'll witness a 22-year-old woman with a variety of styles. The album's best song, \\"Painter Song\\", showcases Norah just riding along with the track. She doesn't try to hit very high notes or ad-lib her way through a verse. This is important in a world where new artists tend to over-prove themselves on their albums.<br />I didn't necessarily give this album five stars because it's classic material. I gave it that because none of the songs are bad and you can listen to it straight through, for all of the songs are three minutes or less, leaving an album of around 45 minutes. And there's nothing wrong with that.
B0000640VO|5.0|Outstanding!!!! Inspiring!!!!<BR>Amelie is the best French film I've ever seen.  Love it!!!!
006016848X|5.0|Years ago, when I first bought this book, I wondered if I bought it for the wrong reasons, because it seemed so simply written.<br />But a wonderful tool that I have acquired from this book, one which I continue to use is what John Gray calls the &quot;Love Letter,&quot; and Barbara DeAngelis calls the, &quot;Emotional Map.&quot;<br />For me, this book represents more about retraining yourself to communicate with yourself, so that you are free to see how others are communicating to you.<br />With the Love Letter, in the 11th chapter, you will face yourself on a level that most of us have never thought possible.<br />While the title of this book is great for marketing, the true lessons are about being responsible for your own experiences, and seeing others for who they are, so that you make empowered decisions that respresent your higher self.<br />The challenge in reading this book will be your willingness to listen to your psyche - it's been waiting for you to take responsibility for your earthly experiences.  Are you willing to do that much for yourself?
B000053VAF|5.0|One word describes this movie &quot;HILARIOUS&quot;.  One thing though, if you don't have a sense of humor, way too religious, then don't bother yourself, you will get nothing out of this except a bad temper.  For those who are like me and are free spirited and don't buy into all the religious BS, buy it, own it, and love it.
B000060P79|5.0|I DEFINATLY reccomend this CD! Simple Plan won 'the top 9 at 9' here in Detroit for a ton of days straight, and they deserve more. This CD is so addicting, you won't want to take it out of your player. With a catchy title like that, who wouldn't want to buy it?
B00003000M|4.0|Although i am morally opposed to this cd because i know it's not what bob would have done, and most of the people who are with him are generally bad people.  However the new beats and the bob marley talking before each song is very nice.  I give it four stars because i liked the music, and although it's a differnet sound than other bob marley tunes, it's good in a different way.
B000002KBA|5.0|I decided to review this one after reading the review of the only guy who had the NERVE to give it 1 star. Here it is what I think of it:<br />Yes, Blackmore doesn't sound the same, for one reason: This was recorded at the time he was still using a Gibson, a very different-sounding guitar, from his Fender, that is. But his playing is, as always, brilliant.<br />I always like to hit the same note in my reviews: The songwriting. That is what it's all about, isn't it? After all, they ARE great musicians all of them, but that means nothing if they aren't playing great songs. Well, songwriting here is PEREFECT. Great tunes, Child in time alone would have qualified this as a great CD. One of the best from one of the best bands of all time.
B000062XFG|3.0|Season Two of Star Trek: The Next Generation shows glimpses of greatness but It's not until Season Three that TNG really caught its stride. The Borg are Introduced in Q Who, one of Season two's finest episodes . The Measure of a Man is also a great episode foreshadowing much of the Character development Data would undergo throughout the Series.  The Emissary would help flesh out Worfs background and give us some much needed insight into what made him tick. Jonathen Frankes was given a greater amount of leeway in his portayel of Riker. Which brought about a more colorful and humorous character instead of the stoic Riker of Season One. Riker also greaw a beard which also helped add warmth to the Character. Of the More notable additions Whoopie Joined the Cast as the memorable Guinan. The shows sets started to evolve as the budjet grew which resulted in a less sterile look. <br />I found this Box set to be good but not great. The Box set contains more extras than season one but thats not saying much. I enjoyed seeing the props and going through Star Trek's vault but what you see is all to brief. The Other Features suffer the same fate. They take what could easily be an hour feature and split it up into tiny pieces so that they can give you the Illusuion that your getting a lot more than wahts really there. The Features I would like to have seen include commentary tracks, deleted scenes, bloopers and Episode preveiws. I guess beggers cant be choosers but I hope that Paramount does a better job with the later season box sets in the Features department. As For the visual and audio quality of the disks, not bad. The Audio has been remastered in 5.1 Surround Sound ( applause here. ) All in all a good set but with definite room for Improvement.
B00003CXI1|4.0|I admit it, I was a naysayer when the Harry Potter first came out.  Being a fan the classic forms of fantasy novels, I wrote it off as a literary Pokemon.  A fad that would burn itself out in a few months.<br />  I am one, though, that believes the old addage of \\"Don't knock it until you've tried it\\", so I did.<br />  I was drawn in the books from the start.  They seemed so compelling and enthralling, that I read all 4 books in the course of a week.  With that under my belt by the end of October of 2001, I found myself waiting for the movie somewhat a kin to a young child waiting for Christmas.  My friends and I went to the movie and were surpised by the number of adults(without children) that were in attendence.  I enjoyed every moment of the movie.  From the amok troll to the breathtaking Qudditch match it was quite entertaining.<br />  The acting wasn't the best from the children, but what can you expect, they are kids, give them a break.  But what really gets to me, is the fact that people are writting reviews about how the movie wasn't as good as the book.  Movies are rarely (almost safe to say NEVER) better than the book.  As far as the adaptation goes, I give it a thumbs up.  With all that goes on in the movie, I was suprised that they pulled it off as well as they did.  If you look at other movies that came out,(Lord of the Rings) major plot points were changed.  Not the case with Harry Potter.  Only minor settings were changed.  If anything, the movie gives a doorway into the world of Harry Potter to those that have not experienced it.  It leads them to the books and a greater love of a young, boy hero that has captured the hearts and imaginations of millions of loyal fans.  Don't put the movie down for what it doesn't have, enjoy what it does have, a sense of adventure and childhood excitement not seen since the first Star Wars movie in 1977.  I say enjoy the movie, read the books, and I'll see you in line for Harry Potter 2

B00005221M|2.0|Disappointing editing choices make this version of the film weaker then the original theatrical release.  Certain powerful momemts from the film are now just plain missing.
6305127689|2.0|Such a great movie, and a featureless DVD!  Hopefully, a Special Edition DVD is in the works.<br />However, The Story of Top Gun is a great DVD about the real Top Gun school. Buy it NOW!  And, no, I am not getting any kick-backs for recommending it.
B000005B0U|5.0|This is a great collection.  One of those CD's where you feel down-right lucky you found it.  Favorites are #7 and #18.  Also a good rendition of RESPECT by Arethra Franklin.  Some of the more bluesy songs aren't as easy to sing along with, but they are still good tunes.  Oh yes.  It is a sing-along CD.
B000005JA8|5.0|Groundbreaking,earthshaking,mascara driven blues with Antmanbee overtones superlative superlatives blah blah blah... So just re-master it already it in order that we can all absorb it in the spirit it was made - sheesh!
B00005JKJA|5.0|Not  for everyone, Lynch's latest film is an amazing exploration of lost dreams and distorted realities. Thank god there are still film makers out there who are creating art instead of just Cosco-style films like \\"Spiderman\\".  Okay, so it's an art film with a hot lesbian sex scene.<br />But remember, much great art is controversial - hated by as many people as it is revered by. Don't buy MD on a whim as it is not an easy movie to absorb. You will need to watch it twice at a minumum.<br />Note to an earlier reviewer who complained about the lack of chapter stops: Unfortanately Lynch requires that with his movies. I find it very annoying as well. Lynch and Kubrik are the greatest directors to put out [junk]DVDs. :-)
B00005JKCF|5.0|Like everyone else, I was wondering just how the big-budget movie version of Marvel's #1 superhero would play.  After all, audiences had suffered through the over-blown camp of Joel Schumacher's dismal BATMAN & ROBIN, and then were entertained by Brian Singer's solid X-MEN.  Fortunately, director Sam Raimi and his stellar cast create a superhero classic that will rank up there with the first 2 Christopher Reeve Superman films and the Tim Burton Batman flicks as the best of their genre.  Indeed, SPIDER-MAN achieves this distinction not for its action, but for its heart.  <BR>     By now, most people are familiar with Spidey's story.  A nerdy high school student, Peter Parker, gains amazing powers after being bitten by a genetically mutated spider during a field trip.  At first, he decides to use his powers for profit.  However, when his thoughtlessness results in the death of his beloved Uncle Ben, he resolves to use them for good...even though many around him question his motives. Indeed, in this movie, the whole story plays as a metaphor for one's coming-of-age...both physically and emotionally.  The casting is solid and most of them find the emotional truth in this unusual story.  Tobey Maguire is perfect as Peter Parker/Spider-Man and he succeeds in getting us to empathize and root for him.  Kirsten Dunst matches him as Mary Jane Watson, the girl who he secretly carries a torch for.  Willem Dafoe is delightfully hammy as the menacing Green Goblin.  J.K. Simmons is an absolute scene- stealer as cranky newspaper editor, J. Jonah Jameson.  Cliff Robertson and Rosemary Harris add a wonderful touch of class as Peter's guardians, Uncle Ben and Aunt May.<BR>     At a brisk 2 hours, Raimi keeps the film going at a good clip and the action sequences are engrossing.  He also has fun with his audiences.  Fans of \\"Xena:Warrior Princess\\" (a TV show that Raimi produced) will get a kick out the various cameos by Lucy Lawless, Ted Raimi and Bruce Campbell.  Of course, one couldquibble about certain things, mainly how the Goblin's suit makes him look more likely to battle the Pink Ranger than Spider-Man, but the movie is so fun that you don't really care. <BR>    All too often, most comic-book based films get caught up only in the action and characterization and depth get ignored as a result.  This film doesn't, making SPIDER-MAN that rare thing indeed.....a superhero film with heart.  Highly recommended.
B00005JKCF|5.0|Tobey Maguire is the best actor ever!!!!!!!I loved Spider-Man.It was a funny,sad,angry parts,of the film.I really really really enjoyed and loved it.when it comes out on DVD or video im buying it.he's cute..im going to watch other movies of him.i never knew about Tobey Maguire untill he stared in Spider-Man.I think Tobey Maguire deserves all the stars in the world....he's such a wonderful and talented actor.I love his work.As long as he stays on this earth,i will always like hime.im going to see his movie,Spider-Man tommarow!(i saw it three times already)I'm excited!I liked the part in the movie when at the end he fought the green gobblen,and he got so angry..that was so cool..#1 fan.. love ya!!!!!!
B00004TFK3|4.0|One thing I hate is when studios put out multiple versions of the same movie and each package contains different features. New Line Cinema is doing this with Lord of the Rings. The same was done with Men in Black. Thankfully, with MIB most of the special features that were on the single disk version were included on the dual disk version, so I don't think I missed anything. However yet another version of this DVD is in the works. I'll be sticking with what I've already bought.<br /> The movie itself is your typical summer blockbuster. It may not set new standards in story telling, but it is certainly a lot of fun with some good looking CGI special effects, something that's becoming a rarity these days. The acting in the movie is probably the most fun, especially the villain of the movie, and Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones are great. The movie may be lacking in depth, but it is supposed to be an action comedy. So this is excusable. This film is worth the purchase, and the load of special features are more than enough to keep fans of the summer blockbuster genre busy for hours on end.
B0000640VO|5.0|American filmmakers should take their cue from this extremely well made romantic comedy which makes almost every Hollywood project look formulaic and trite.  It is beautifully realized with imaginative writing, exquisite cinematography, excellent direction, and perfect casting.  Jeunet has reached a pinnacle in his style and storytelling, creating a brilliant work teeming with art, poetry, comedy, and love.<BR>Even if romanic comedies generally stick in your craw (as they do with me) this one will make you realize that it can be done sucessfully and beautifully.  SEE IT!!!
B00005J79H|5.0|Last year, the summer of 2001, I was on vacation. I was looking for new music I could listen to when traveling, and stumbled over this release. I didn`t even know it was out, it just suddenly appeared. I bought the cd, and started listening to it. And boy was I positively surprised. I did expect it to be good, but not to be so great it actually is. <BR>The intimate mood and the special \\"Non\\" Scorpions sound make this a winner. A warm and welcome album from the best Rockers in Europe. <BR>It is sort of a combined album. The sound is acoustic, but it doesn`t sound ALL acoustic. It is a special sound, but it is warm and welcome, just like a perfect relaxing summeralbum.<BR>The songs. The songs are well performed, but the tracklisting could have been better. Some of the songs are sweet, and my personal favorites, like the new and Beautiful song \\"Life is too short\\", the catchy \\"The Zoo\\", the always fantastic \\"Still loving you\\" and the mystical and soothing \\"Send me an Angel\\". All these songs are the album`s highlight, but \\"Love of my life\\", \\"I wanted to cry(But the tears wouldn`t come)\\" and \\"Always somewhere\\" are great too. The songs that are not so good, would be \\"You and I\\", \\"Hurricane 2001\\" and \\"Dust in the wind\\". These songs are not very good here. Rock you like a hurricane is a great song original, but not stripped down. <BR>(I would rather have songs like \\"When the smoke is going down\\", \\"Coast to Coast\\" and more classical Scorpions songs, but hey, we can`t get everything!)<BR>Anyway, this album is great. I can`t wait for Scorpions to go into Studios again for another Studio-album, but until then this album will fill the time, along with \\"Love at first sting\\", \\"Animal Instinct\\" and \\"Blackout\\".
B00005YW4H|5.0|Each and every song on this album moves me...all in wonderful, different ways.  Some bring me back to my childhood, others to memories of ex-boyfriends who just weren't right, while others bring me up to the clouds, the mountains, a rainy day.  This is a magical and inspiring c.d.  Not to mention, I've seen Norah in concert and she is even more amazing in person.  To think that someone so young has talents so well-developed!  Go for it...you can't lose with this one.
B00005QG9J|2.0|I remember back in '97 when incubus was still pure. They had came out with the most amazing cd, SCIENCE and i was in awe. Brandon Boyde wrote the most thought provoking lyrics, Dirk's funk/jazz/metal bass was just amazing, Jose's drum beats were thought out and full, Mike used guitar effects that weren't cliche, and DJ Life was in the band. I thought everything was going great for incubus, then Make yourself came out and DJ life left the band. Now, we see incubus playing songs like drive. The only things kilmore does is WHIKKY WHAS. When morning view came out, i was afraid to see what my once favorite band was putting out. I listened to the cd and there were a few good songs. I personally think the only amazing song on this cd is Echoes. Another thing that [angered me] aobut the cd is that incubus is just not floyd. Wish you were here, echoes. They need original sound names. Then, this cd sounds like a wannabe make yourself. Echoes sounds too much like stellar, and 11 am sounds too much like drive. I'd suggest you put down this cd and buy science,you won't regret it.
B00005QG9J|4.0|Over the last ten years Incubus has gone through a variety of sounds and styles, but Morning View's melodic patterns are the most different yet. Unlike their previous albums Incubus took the rap out of their metal and replaced it with angelic vocals and a hollow body sound. I am a fan of the bands earlier work and I have to admit this album did not appel to me at first. However, within a week I was singing along to songs like 11am and Just a Phase. This album is definitley a change of pace for Incubus and some might accuse them of selling out. Nevertheless, this is a well done album and I commend them for trying something new.
B00002SSRZ|3.0|Okay, my turn to chime in.  For me, this is multi-channel (SACD, DVD-AUDIO or DTS) disc number 72 for me.  I purchased the re-packaged (long, slim jewel case) DTS CD and popped it into my player.  I do not have the 2 channel SACD to use for comparison but I do have the regular remastered CD.  This mix presents a wildly un-musical, psychedelic=like four channel guitar panning, throwing Carlos' guitar solos all over the place.  In is a little unsettling.  But the first thing you will notice on BLACK MAGIC WOMAN is that the .1 channel is almost non-existent.  Gone is the wonderfully fat bass line, especially those G's (G1 on your piano keyboard).  Also gone is the low thump of the bass drum.  It's like listening to Santana perform and having the bassist playing about 20 feet behind them with his amp turned down really low.  I had to crank my Velodyne WAAAAY up to match the SPLs of the 2 channel CD.  Although the timbre of the instruments is really top notch on this release, Abraxas deserved a much better remastering than it received here.  In my own opinion, this release and Wings' VENUS & MARS are DTS' worst 5.1 CDs on the market.
B00005RRG9|5.0|Disney is finally becoming smart and are releasing their classics for the first time on DVD.<br />I was very impressed with the Parent Trap 2 cd set. The commentary between the director David Swift and star Hayley Mills was VERY interesting. Hayley talks about how difficult it was playing two parts as well as many other pieces of trivia and interesting facts about the movie. The sound is really good since it is THX certified, and the picture is crisp and clear. The behind the scenes documentary is a great plus along with the animated short that is included as well.  There is alot more extras than are even listed on the back.  There is a jukebox that plays songs from the movie, a documentary on the woman who played Hayley's twin, and much more!<br /> You will want this movie for your collection, because it still has the charm of a Disney classic with a twist of modern technology with TONS of extras included. I was very satisfied with my purchase and I highly recommend that if you like this movie or have it on vhs, get the DVD while you can!
B00003CX5P|5.0|For all starwars fans this is well worth the money the deleted scenes are so cool and one of them george lucas put back in the movie so this dvd has more than the original release. You can't go wrong.
B00004ZSB6|5.0|AC/DC's first studio album in five years is a total pleasure to listen to.  After their 1995 release, &quot;Ballbreaker,&quot; Angus Young commented to Guitar Player magazine &quot;We've recorded the same album over and over again seventeen tinmes.&quot;  Well, with &quot;Stiff Upper Lip,&quot; make that eighteen.<br />In fact, all the songs on the album follow an old pattern: Brian Johnson sings a short intro that couldn't be confused with a full-fledged verse, then there's a crescendo of a buildup topped off by Phil Rudd's crashing cymbals and Angus' and Malcolm's twin guitar attack.  Then, Brian just sings the name of the song twenty or thirty times before Angus launches into a blistering solo, finished off with Brian singing the name of the song over again, but *like he really means it*, the last few notes spilling of of Angus' guitar strings.<br />But, so what!  Their 4/4 time blues-based meat grinders are infectious and contagious. They grew on me after one listening. Formulaic, for certain, but played with so much conviction that you don't care.  They're just great, straightforward rockers.  Take, for example, &quot;Stiff Upper Lip&quot;  falls right into the pattern, but still it's ballsy.  &quot;House of Jazz&quot; has Brian singing like Louis Armstrong like he did in &quot;Boogie Man&quot; on &quot;Ballbreaker.&quot;  If you think Johnson's voice couldn't get any more gravelly, check this one out.<br />The best songs on this album are &quot;Satellite Blues,&quot; &quot;Safe in New York City&quot; and &quot;Give It Up&quot; and are driven by Cliff Williams' power bass with a steady backbeat that hearkens back to AC/DC's earlier fare, like &quot;Live Wire&quot; and &quot;Bedlam in Belgium.&quot;<br />I have this album on CD, which I bought in the states, and which I heartily recommend.  But, when I was visiting Berlin, Germany, I found it on vinyl.  I can't even begin to tell you the pleasure of finding a RECORD I love and putting it on my old Thorens (withOrtofon OM-10 stylus), and listening to the beautiful sounds *between the grooves* that an antisceptic instrument like a CD player can't pick up. A great record player is a great acoustic instrument, and it's so sad we've lost that particular sound from our aural vocabulary. If you've got a great turntable, put this wax on your platter!  This European pressing was cut by WEA/Elektra and is up to the high standards of those &quot;Imported European Pressings&quot; from the 70s and 80s that you gladly paid twice as much for until Mobile Fidelity Sound Lab started making quality vinyl in America.  The extra money is well worth paying.  It's an indescribable feeling getting nostalgic about new sounds from a reliable band listening to old (but better) technology!
B00005OWIU|5.0|After I saw Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone on the silver screen, I literally became obsessed with the books.  I blame it all on the movie, though it truly doesn't do the book justice.  The aspect of the film that left the greatest impression on me was the music.  I knew immediately that I wanted the soundtrack, though it took me a few months to finally buy it.  As soon as I owned that CD, I tossed it into my Discman and fell madly in love with John Williams' creation.  From the first note of 'Prologue', to the final chord of 'Hedwig's Theme', I felt as if I'd been transported to the magical world of Hogwarts.  The score moves from upbeat to enchanting to haunting to heart wrenching and all the way back to triumphant.  Tracks like 'The Invisibility Cloak...' and 'The Face of Voldemort' place you in dark corridors and eerie rooms, while 'Harry's Wondrous World' and 'Leaving Hogwarts' leave you feeling rejuvenated.  This charming (no pun intended) soundtrack has so much to offer.
B00005JKDR|5.0|These movie is amazing. The characters are fun. The history made me cry and laugh :)
B00005YXZH|3.0|To me, everything that the critics say about YHF really applies to Summerteeth, the group's last record.  That record proved to be much more musical and experimental then YHF.  I do enjoy some of the lyrics and think there are some good tunes but really, why &quot;Summerteeth&quot; is a much richer record.
B00005JKNF|3.0|Robert Altman's Gosford park is a charming and very well-donw attempt to make a period Edwardian Country House Murder-Mystery <BR>drama, given the fact that he's American. While Altman has paid an enormous amount of detail to the intricacies of Edwardian social etiquette, it's a shame he didn't pay so much attention to the plot.<br />It's your usual whodunnit drama. The trouble is, it's been done hundreds of times before, albeit in cheaper TV and film versions of Agatha Christie novels. The first hour or so is devoted to setting up the characters both upstairs and downstairs and Altman takes great pleasure in showing off the great ensemble cast (which includes almost every british actor of note over 30 worth their salt). When the murder is committed, the usual cliches are rolled out: Stephen Fry's bumbling performance as a detective is so bad its almost good but ultimately too unrealistic and the usual downstairs speculation begins. even the line \\"Maybe the butler did it\\" is uttered by the detective's assistant. Fry's detective doesn't solve the murder or provide any insight into at all and, after just one visit to the house, leaves the film, never to be seen again. His presence appears to be there just to laugh at the British police system and provide the token bumbling detective role in a murder-mystery movie.<br />The solution to the murder is a nice twist, but it's impact is wasted as all the truth comes out in the last fifteen to twenty minutes of the film, leaving us no time to contemplate how it affects the staff.<br />Overall verdict: The period details are nice and the Edwardian social comedy aspect is very good, but as a murder-mystery film, this film would fall before the first hurdle because of it's complete unbelievability.
6303908306|4.0|The surprise ending wasn't as surprising as it might have been, but the film is so well written, well plotted, and well put together that it really doesn't matter.  Many of the twists along the way were surprising.  All in all it's a great movie with some fabulous performances.  Although I found Benicio del Toro somewhat annoying as Fenster, the rest were all standouts, especially Kevin Spacey as the crippled and boring Verbal, Gabriel Byrne as the trying to reform Keaton, Chazz Palmintieri as a smart and sympathetic cop, and the underrated Pete Postlethwaite, doing a great accent.
0385503954|5.0|The first part of this book, going to about page 175, takes a lot of patience and concentration to get through.  That is not to say that it is an unenjoyable or difficult read, but there is a lot of descripition, as well as intense character developemnt.  But once you get to know these characters, good luck shaking their minds from yours.  I did not realize how captivated I was until I read the last sentnce, closed the book, sighed, and said to my wife, &quot;I'm really sad.&quot;  Not so much because of how the story ends but because it was finished.  Read this simply to meet a handful of people you would probably otherwise never meet.  This is a brilliantly written piece of fiction with characters that are sorely lacking in most modern fiction--characters completely fleshed out to honest, painful lengths!
B00005JKL8|2.0|If you know what really happenned in the war in Bosnia you will laugh at this movie. It is supposedly presenting a true story a la' Hollywood style glorifying our pilot shot down in Bosnia. It is a patriotic movie but at the expense of the Serbs who suffered enough from us without being made into a motley crew of heartless, bloodthirsty savages in another Hollywood happy ending lie.<br />The beginning of the movie is too long to prep you for the whole ordeal. I love Gene Hackman but he looked fake and desperate in this movie. Owen Wilson is fun but not here while he is sliding on his behind shooting at the serbian tanks and heavy machine guns with his side arm getting the best of them. The story as a whole doesn't fall through.<br />Skip it and get a better flick, there are a lot more better choices at the local [store].
B000001FFJ|5.0|What can I say...One of the greatest albums ever recorded. A wunderkammer of delights, each dusty shelf containing a priceless jewel. I remember first listening to this album: my brother and I looked at one another, mouths-agape; song after song further confirming  that this was to be a candidate,for both of us, for favorite album of all time. If I had to pick one desert island disc, this would be it. Great music of stunning variety , evocative lyrics conjuring wonderful stories populated by colorful characters, and a mood (or, rather, moods) like none else.
006016848X|5.0|After reading this book I gained an unbelievable insight into my husband's needs and moods.  The book made me understand that men are truly diffferent to women and that we need to be able to communicate properly to gain entrance to the other's mind and thoughts.<BR>I feel more capable of resolving problems are they now arise and have learned to listen as well as ask.<BR>The book also taught me to respect both my husband's needs as well as my own.<BR>To conclude I found this book to be the best money spent in a while. <BR>My only suggestion is that your partner read the book aswell.<BR>I would dearly like to be able to tell John Gray my thoughts myself and to show my appreciation.
B0000640S2|1.0|It was estimated that Rambo gunned down 98 Communists in this movie, but it might as well be an entire nation.  If warfare was this easy, then the U.S. should have returned Rambo to Afghanistan to take out Osama bin Laden by himself.  (There's still time, given the recent news about a possible Rambo IV.)<br />The movie served its purpose in the heyday of Reagan's Cold War America.  After being shunned in the 1970s, Vietnam vets finally got some respect in the 1980s, or so it seemed.  I could imagine what a vet like Ron Kovic would say about this jester of a movie.<br />The scene where Rambo barely escaped a napalm bomb, and subsequent machine gun sweep, was truly a distortion in history.  It makes us forget which side used napalm during the Vietnam War, and used it with pleasure.<br />Even more ridiculous was when Rambo shot up the American base with his M-60, and then let off the last rounds into the ceiling while emitting a rebel yell.  Every time I watch this scene, I would burst out laughing.  This was the quintessential gung-ho garbage that Hollywood sold us then, and has not quite stopped selling us since.
B00005RRG9|5.0|Both the movie and the DVD get 5 stars plus!!!  I've loved this movie since I was a kid, and was so happy about it's release on DVD.  What I didn't expect was that it's one of the best DVD's I own.  It's great to see the film on disc one in letterbox.  Prior to the film is the Donald Duck short that was seen in theaters when the film was released!  The extras on disc two are phenomenal!  This is where the magic really happens.  There are interviews with Hayley Mills, Director David Swift, Hayley's double Sharon (yes her name is Sharon like the character) and related pieces with The Sherman Brothers, Ward Kimball, Kevin Corcoran and others which make it a must for every Disney fan.  Plus there is tons of footage, clips, photos, music, drawings and storyboards, and so many clips from the disney archives. All this, but there are also documentaries about the film itself, discussions about the split screen effects, and more.  It's obvious that the folks at Disney took their time and did their homework.  Congratulations to the producers listed at the end of this DVD on a job VERY well done!  Hope to see more soon.
B000000H7I|5.0|I have been a fan of Suffocation since I heard 'Pierced From The Inside', and so I decided to check out their first full length, 'Effigy Of The Forgotten'. 'Effigy' breaks down the basics of death metal. Barely deciferable vocals (though in this case really ..., and really good), hard guitar riffs, bass line that will crash through your skull, and just a lot of blastbeats. In this case, everything was great. Songs like \\"Reincremation\\" (my favorite song on the album), \\"Involuntary Slaughter\\", and \\"Liege of Inveracity\\" are true death metal classics. Lyrically, it does not get too violent or vulgar, but there are some pretty messed up things. \\"Seeds Of The Suffering\\" is an epic (well, it's over 5 minutes long, an epic for death metal standards [c'mon, it's not Dream Theater]) track that is hard and melodic at the same time without losing it's deathly vibe to it. Also, on the tracks \\"Reincremation\\" and \\"Mass Obliteration\\", George \\"Corpsgrinder\\" (of the Mostrocity and now of the new (and finally kick ...) Cannibal Corpse), one of my favorite death metal vocallists of all time. There is only one flaw, the production. The C.D. sounds like it was recording in a basement. The beginning riff on \\"Reincreamation\\" is memorable, but you can barely feel it because of the poor production. This a death metal masterpiece that not metal head should be without, though it lacks the greatness of 'Pierced From Within', it derves its time in the C.D. player...
B00004TJJZ|4.0|Before I saw this movie I thought it would have another Independence Day scenario, the aliens are going to take over the world and I assumed the Men In Black had to save us. Not so. The aliens have already taken over the world, and the MIB are just monitoring them and going about their daily business. (I hope I haven't given too much away!) However, much to the dismay of veteran Agent K (Tommy Lee Jones) and new recruit Agent J (WIll Smith) a bug donning a brand new Edgar suit (Vincent D'Onofrio) has just crash landed on Earth, certain to reek havoc. Lets just say this is definitely entertaining!<br />Tommy Lee Jones is great as the funny yet cool as a cucumber \\"old guy\\", while Will Smith has lots of great one liners as the policeman turned MIB agent. At first I though Dr. Laurel Weaver, played by Linda Fiorentino, was an unnecessary character put in there just because she was beautiful and they needed a romance. But the next time I saw it, I thought scenes with her in it were actually pretty comical. As for me, my favorite character was the bug - he didn't fit properly in the skin of a human, acted like such a cretan, but was still sarcastic. He was hilarious! (Vincent D'Onofrio can play anything, I swear.)<br />All in all, hysterical movie (funnywise) that is probably worth seeing, if only for its entertainment value.
0767903862|5.0|I read some of the reviews which gave this book only one star and was stunned to find that most of them came from Australians who are very pleased to read books which send up the idiosyncrasies of other countries but can't cop the criticism of their own.Lighten up and just enjoy ! This is such a funny book that I had to stop reading it in front of other people as I was chuckling so much at his SOO true descriptions of people, places and events. I loved every second of it !
B0000020C4|5.0|I couldn't believe that Ms. Kimel of Pennsylvania wrote that she disliked Lea Salonga's performance because &quot;she sounded too American&quot;.Puh-leeze ! What a hoot. FYI, Judy Kuhn and Anthony Crivello are Americans, Colm Wilkinson is Irish and Philip Quast is Australian. They didn't sound &quot;British&quot; which was Ms. Kimel's criteria. Les Miserables is a French novel, yet we don't expect the cast to sound French. I think that Cameron MacIntosh went interracial because he recognizes talent when he sees it. Hurrah for all the non-British performers here and abroad. I was extremely delighted by the incredible performances : Lea Salonga's voice is crystalline and emotion- packed. Michael Ball ,Ruthie Henshall and Colm Wilkinson touched me with their heart-felt perormances. The TAC video will forever be my favorite.
B000059XY7|5.0|Colorful, exhilirating, and magical, Christopher Reeve's &quot;Superman&quot; is a worthy translation of the first super-hero's never-ending crusade for &quot;truth, justice, and the American way&quot; to the big screen.  My Dad took me to see this when it first came out in the 70s, and the years haven't dimmed this gem one bit.  Reeve, of course, is perfectly cast as the orphan from the stars who will become Earth's greatest hero.  Margot Kidder is a wonderful Lois Lane, and Gene Hackman has a ball as criminal mastermind Lex Luthor.  Marlon Brano's Jor-El lends a powerful authority to the opening scenes on doomed Krypton, and his lingering presence haunts the rest of the movie much as his spirit does Kal-El.  Funny, touching, and suspenseful in exactly the right touches (well, Lois Lane's mid-flight poety recital might be a bit much), &quot;Superman:  The Movie&quot; is for everyone who was ever a kid, and every boy who ever wanted to fly like Superman.
B00005QGAT|5.0|Off the Wall was the best album Michael Jackson ever released.  I prefer this album over Thriller, Bad, Dangerous, HIStory, and Invincible.  When I hear the other albums, they don't come close to the greatness of this album.  I recently bought the Special Edition CD of Off the Wall, and I was already hooked on it when I pulled out the CD case from the special edition sleeve.  On the back of the CD, there's a very good-looking, young Michael Jackson posing in front of the brick wall in his then-trademark tuxedo.  When I saw it, I immediately wished that Michael was still that young and cute.  I then opened the CD case and saw the back of the booklet.  To my surprise, I saw another rare picture of twenty-one year old Michael staring back at me in front of that same brick wall.  I knew then that just for the booklet and pictures, that it was a special album.  I had the cassette tape of Off the Wall when I was a kid, but when I put it in my CD player, I was blown away all over again.  Michael sounded absolutely beautiful (Check out \\"I Can't Help It\\" and his falsetto on \\"Don't Stop 'Til You Get Enough\\").  This sounded much better than the cassette tape I had.  I fell in love with Off the Wall all over again.  Michael's voice was in top form in those days.  He sounded very confident and sexy here.  I had never heard Michael sing with such joy on the albums after Off the Wall.  This is the album that made Michael a force to be reckoned with, and to enhance that, they even threw in home demos of \\"Don't Stop 'Til You Get Enough,\\" and \\"Working Day and Night.\\"  I thought Janet and Randy's arguement at the beginning of the demo for \\"Working Day and Night\\" was hilarious.  Even though this album is twenty-three years old (!), it still holds up against the test of time.  It makes those remember when Michael was just another singer trying to break away from the Jackson 5/Jacksons.  It reminds me of how much Michael has truly changed, and I'm not sure if that's for the better or not.  Anyway, this special edition of Off the Wall is a must-have, and I reccomend it to anyone looking to hear Michael's true potential as an adult artist, and to realize how much he has lost since then.  You won't be disappointed by this album.  I guarentee it.
B0000256VK|4.0|This so far is the first Roxy Music album I have purchased so far and it's a great album. Avalon is a gem in my CD collection with awesome songs with a mix of Rock, Jazz, R&amp;B and pop all fused in one.<br />This album is similar to Bryan Ferrys solo album Boys and Girls althouhg not as dark and is more mainstream.<br />By 1982 Roxy Music had transformed from a sort of rock band into a soul/rock band(TFF went through the same transformation from The Big Chair to The Seeds Of Love LP).<br />Many of us have already heard the title track before. It's a truly great song that will make you feel good. The best song thouhg I would say is The Space Between. It reminds me of David Bowies 1983 hit Let's Dance with similar rhythms and guitars and beats. I love both songs alot.<br />This is an essential recording for both Roxy Music and Bryan Ferry fans. Ferry would take this sound and continue it on Boys and Girls and Bete Noire. It's an epic farewell.<br />Unfortunately I have to give this CD a four because at only 37 and a half minutes it ends just as you're getting into the music and the remastered edition doesnt include any B-Sides, Rare Tracks or liner notes. Enjoy the epic farewll album from Roxy Music.
B00005JKNF|5.0|Since the DVD has not yet been released, this is a review of the movie.<br />I was skeptical about this movie -- Robert Altman films can be difficult.  But he has scored big with this one.  The cast is perfect -- don't we all see Maggie Smith as English upper crust?<br />Don't get me wrong -- you have to pay close attention.  Like most Altman films, there is a lot going on -- certainly more than one plot with people talking over each other (just like in real life).  At it's very basic level, this is a murder mystery, and the scenes with the detective were hilarious.<br />Bottom line -- if you like your comedy spoon fed (this really isn't an insult, just that some people don't want to work when they see a movie), then you probably won't enjoy this.  If you like intelligent movies with sophisticated (and some base) humor, with twists and turns and multiple plots, this is the movie for you.<br />I can't wait for the DVD release!
B000000H3W|5.0|With the 80's coming to an end and the 90's just beggining, many of the thrash bands like Metallica, Anthrax and Testament changed direction. The metal fan base was in anxious state: who would continue to hold the metal torch through the 90's?  Albums like Metallica's Black album and Testament's Souls of black were meeting commercial appeal without retaining of the grit that made them what them famous in the first place.<br />Arise was released and exceeded every metal fans wildest dreams.  Here was an album that could rival any album that Metallica had put out in the 80's and live up to expectations.  <BR>The boys from Sepultura knew they had to stick to their guns. They knew that change was good, but it was important to remember their roots. Having released an excellent an album two years earlier (Beneath the remains) the pressure and our boys from Brazil delivered!<br />Arise was a welcomed addition to every metal fan's music collection. Sepultura strays from the satan lyrics of past albums like Morbid Visions and MOVED ON to political issues. The ferocity remains, Sepultura know that they don't have to make a song heavy just for the sake of being heavy. Being skilled musicians, they know that songs need structure and a sens of melody. In the case of Arise their is a perfect ballance bewtween melody and agression. <br />Dead embyronic cells, desperate cry, all knock you down but let you hear the true genius at work. For example, the track Desperate cry has this interlude where things build up to a great solo, proving that a great solo doesn't have to be played fast or sqeal, it has to fit the mood of the song. Max Cavalera is a great axeman, and his brother Igor is a powerhouse behind the kit. <br />Sepultura's later albums would expreiment with more of a tribal sound with tin drums etc, but they would never match this master piece.
B00005K9LN|5.0|The album that helped propel Judas Priest to a worldwide force in heavy metal.  Rock radio staples from years past (and in some cases even today) &quot;Breaking the Law&quot; and &quot;Living After Midnight&quot; are highlights here, as is the anthem like &quot;United&quot; and the equally great &quot;Metal Gods&quot;.  While &quot;British Steel&quot; is a great album as we all know, the sound is still dated even though the album is supposedly remastered.  The bonus tracks aren't anything special either; listen to &quot;Red, White, &amp; Blue&quot; and you can hear why its a bonus track to begin with, while the live version of &quot;Grinder&quot; pales in comparison to to anything off of Priest's &quot;Unleashed in the East&quot; and &quot;Priest...Live&quot; live albums.  All in all though, this is still &quot;British Steel&quot;, and it is essential to any metalhead's collection.
B00000FBRE|5.0|This is by far THE best Lagwagon album. i first heard of them on THPS2 for comp. (may 16). Ever since then i was hooked. I GET TO SEE THEM ON THE VANS WARPED TOUR AUGUST 15, 2002!!! My favorite songs are Train, May 16, and Gun in your hand.
068484267X|5.0|Beautiful and moving.  Lingers in the mind after the story is done.  A friend said they had trouble with McCourt's writing style and I told them to read it like you were reading music lyrics...because in a way it is a song or a collection of them.  Very bittersweet.  I won't retell the plot, you already know by now, doubtless.  <br />He paints a picture of life so bleak that it's hard to believe it's occuring in 20th Century Europe and not some Dickensian urban setting.  I never in my life knew that an egg could be so highly valued until I read this memoir.  It's good soul food for the eyes.  Read it.<br />I also might recommend Helias' The Horse of Pride if you're interested in the history and ethnography of fading European cultures.
B00003CXAE|5.0|I never saw this movie when it first came out, but a friend of mine had, and he had the soundtrack on cassette. We used to listen to it all the time when his mother was taking us places. After being sold on the great music, I finally saw it on TV one time. I was hooked. The music is great, and the story fits the music. I own this movie on laser disc, and can't wait to get a copy on DVD as well.<br />Between the wonderful title song written by the Bee Gees, and a great job by Olivia Newton-John on her songs, the music alone makes this a wonderful movie. It is icing on the cake to have wonderful choreography and acting as well. Stockard Channing makes a great Rizzo, and even Frankie Avalon makes an appearance as the Teen Angel.
B000002UA2|5.0|On Obscured by Clouds Pink Floyd bring us lavalamp psychedelia in their own unique style and with a verve and feeling to the music which makes most other bands seem like they are just playing at being songwriters. The songs are uniformly excellent. Something you wouldn't expect from a band that had given the world such weird and wonderful experiments as the twenty minute &quot;Atom Heart Mother&quot; and the anthem to lunitics with embarrassing names, &quot;Careful With that Axe, Eugene&quot;, is a collection of (almost) conventional short songs but that's what Obscured by Clouds is - a damn near perfect rock album. Nevertheless, the Floyd don't compromise their art in any way. The songs are inventive in their structures, melodies, lyrics, chord progression and production. The band put as much emotion into their music as ever and the songs could never be called commercial or forced. The almost unbelievably modern sounding beat on the title track, the dreamy production on &quot;Burning Bridges&quot; and &quot;Mudmen&quot;, the very dodgy singing on &quot;Absolutely curtains&quot; and the eclectic mixture of styles are just a few of the innovative little tricks that stops Obscured by Clouds from sounding quite normal. The music is complex and inspired with deep, soul-searching lyrics and an underlying disregard for convention that they clearly haven't abandoned, only emphasised less than usual. Overall, Obscured by Clouds is an underrated gem with a light, youthful feel about it, even though something much darker was just around the corner...
B000003N7G|5.0|Those were the words of the record store owner as I brought the cover to the counter to purchase. I of course already knew this; I may be a compulsive buyer when it come to CDs but I am also selective (otherwise I would probably have triple the amount of CDs I do!) and I had heard the music on this album before.<br />I had heard a year before I purchased it. At the time I was fairly new to the jazz world. I had listened to the work of Miles Davis on Kind of Blue and Birth of the Cool. This album is nothing like this. It is ironic that Miles who was an often short-tempered and jealous man would be able to play music with such beauty and eloquence. Coltrane was often referred to as an &quot;angry tenor&quot; for his often raw and bursting solos, yet he seems like someone who would be more the brooding kind. <br />Over the year I have become a much deeper jazz fan and I understand a great deal about the history of the music. Having listened to the more free and wild sounding work of Miles' Second Quintet at the famous Plugged Nickel in 1965, I had grown more used to to strangeness that seemed present on &quot;A Love Supreme&quot;. <br />This album is so emotional it is not funny. He plays from his soul. The music seems like noise to a person who has the audacity to play it as background music, but if you focus on Coltrane's soloing, you'll hear something close to pure beauty.<br />Not for the faint hearted and the unadventurous, this is an album that is demanding but very rewarding. If you bring an open mind with you for a listening session, you'll bring so much out with you. Although this was John's prayer to God, he has left us with a divine gift that shows us that God's is a love supreme.
B00004U30D|5.0|American beauty wasnt just another movie. If people didnt know it had a very deep meaning. The director of the movie planned it that way. First off the movie was about seeing that life is so fast and hectic and you shouldn't let it pass you. Also dont let people walk over you. Kevin Spacey showed that in the movie. Last but not least you have to work for your moment. It just doesnt happen. By moment i mean your 15 mins of fame. It shows that if you want something bad enough you will get it. I think thats what Spacey showed in the movie. By working out and standing up for him self. He proved that even in the end if you die you can still come out of life feeling good and not down. Dont sit back and let your moment fly by. Work your [butt] off for it and show people that your alot better then they think.
630575067X|4.0|I would say come on jaba you can do better than this but still his performance was ok but i think its an insult to him if i called him john hartson or the notorious hammy from cambuskenneth. but over all i think the film went incredibaly well as it was succes every where but i still dont call it the best film of all time. scott hamilton was reported missing for a few days and the school dollar acadamy were incredibaly worried for the upcoming star of movies today i think he was away in the auditions for episode 2 . but i shouldnt be talkin about shamoos son and more about the film, this was a hit in my houshold and also for young children all the other star wars films were mostly watched by the older people and eposode 1 was attracted by every one but motly young ones but i say come on jaba keep greased up for eposode 2. i rate this film a 4 star
B000024A70|5.0|This is the first of the three greatest hits compliations released by Queen, and is considered by most to be their best (although I would personally put Greatest Hits 2 slightly ahead of it).<BR>The best songs on this album are so well known that it is hardly worth me commenting on them (I'm sure everyone already has their own opinions of the likes of 'Bohemian Rhapsody', 'We Will Rock You' and 'We Are The Champions') but thats not to say their aren't any others worth listening to on here.<BR>The compilations only downpoint however, is that Queen were an outstanding band in the fact that every one of their albums offers over half a dozen brilliant tracks, meaning they have many other songs which are equal to (if not better than) many of the tracks chosen for this compliation, but if you're just looking for an introductory album to Queen's music then this is fine.
0385505833|3.0|I had similar thoughts in my early 20s about Diwali (Indian festival celebrated in India) played by the main character Luther Krank in the book.<br />It is little hard to understand why the whole neighbourhood is interested to know why Luther Krank is not celebrating Christmas. I don't know if this happens in USA where people have more privacy and people don't bother what others do.<br />I would say this is more likely to happen in India, ie. if someone decides not to celebrate Diwali a particular year, then the whole building would want to know the reason etc.....<br />I wish I could write a book &quot;Skipping Diwali&quot;
B00005OAIE|5.0|Any of you who fondly remember and enjoy Michael Franks will love John Mayer. He's like Michael Franks reincarnated in the current generation. His lyric is thoughtful, inspiring, and the rhythm is motivating, but not compelling to dance to. <br />I haven't been this excited about a new artist in years. Finally, some real *talent* in current &quot;popular&quot; music. I hope that John Mayer gets some attention and air time so that he can inspire others.<br />BUY IT!
B000002UJQ|5.0|This is one of the finest albums ever created.  If you choose to disagree, you are simply wrong.  Reconsider sharing any further opinions regarding any form of music.  You have lost all credibility.
0671042858|4.0|This book was like a breath of fresh air after reading Dreamcatcher. The plot is very simple: a survival story about a little girl lost in the woods. King manages to avoid the psychological babbling of his recent books but still pull you in with well developed characters.<br />In this story a little nine year old girl must battle the elements, her fear of a stalking creature, and the deterioration of her body and senses.<br />This book is not meant to scare you into the wee hours of the night but it will keep you turning the pages just the same. King makes you care about this girl and whether or not she will survive, which makes it a given that she will (this isn't a Bachman novel). Knowing this doesn't take away from the intensity of her struggle.<br />I highly recommend this to Stephen King fans or anyone who loves a good read.
B000021YQV|4.0|The two singles you've probably heard are &quot;Chop Suey&quot; and &quot;Toxicity&quot;, both of which feature very original and surprising shifts in the speed and tone of the music, going from passionate rage to calm sweetness and back again.  Be assured, these are not the only two songs like that on the album; it is a CD that deliveres what it claims -- exciting and creative music.
0446310786|4.0|I believe that there are many reasons that Harper Lee wrote this book.  In my opinion the main reason for the book is to inform people about a time period in America, which is often overlooked or not known about.  Before I read this book I had never heard of the Scottsboro trial.  I learned a lot about the trial and some of the things that took place.  Another reason I why I think Lee wrote this book was to entertain.  I found this book for the most part entertaining and enjoyable to read.  I liked all of the foreshadowing, metaphors, and moral values.
B00005T30L|1.0|Bad acting highlites a story of a girl who is not ony sarcastic, cynical and deppressed, but screws up everyone elses life around her. Of couurse, shes deep, so shes not responsible. A horrible mix of cliches- it felt like 10 hours long.
B00004BZ0V|3.0|I was a teenage Clash fan back in '77 when I bought the original import LP even though the record store clerk told me about the \\"terrible sound quality.\\" Like I even cared about audio fidelity. I just wanted to hear real English punk rock, the louder the better. Anyway, the Clash were amazing to behold in those days. I had the privilege of seeing them on their first couple of American tours, through the London Calling days. Then something happened, and I think it had to do with them reading too many of their album reviews or something. To be honest, I think they peaked somewhere between the first album and the second. But they were still so good that they were able to coast for a couple more years after that. Well, this CD walks you through that process. It starts off ruggedly with \\"White Riot\\", and quickly builds to a pinnacle with the trilogy of singles \\"Complete Control\\", \\"Clash City Rockers\\" and \\"Hammersmith Palais\\" which were just so excellent when they came out and I think are clearly the highlights of this compilation. But once you get past \\"London Calling,\\" IMO you pretty much have run out of the good stuff. I remember back when \\"Sandinista!\\" came out, so many of my friends and I were just dumbfounded at how goofy the band had become. \\"Magnificent Seven\\" was more or less disco, which is definitely not why we bought Clash records. And \\"Hitsville UK\\"?!?! What was that? Why did they release it as \\"The Clash?\\" It made no sense to us at the time and it still doesn't after all these years. So it is to this day that I've never even listened to \\"Sandinista!\\" all the way through. I mean, punk rock bands and triple-albums just aren't meant for each other. The Clash became too preoccupied with trying to top Bruce Springsteen after he released \\"The River\\" I think. They managed to come up with a few radio friendly hits to wrap up a decent career (Casbah and Should I...) but they were never able to recapture the passion of their earlier years once they started getting sogimmicky and experimental. What was wrong with thundering guitars and powerful choruses, I wonder? Anyway, you can do a lot better than this to enjoy or understand the Clash. If you had to choose just one disc, there's no question, just get the US version of their debut and you will feel the power of a band that really harnessed the energy and emotion of that era.

0446677450|4.0|I found this book ver interesting. It gave me a new prespective on making money. He contrasts the differences in economic strategies between &quot;Rich Dads&quot; and &quot;Poor Dads&quot; and they generally depict the pros and cons of economic decisions typically made by entrepreneurs in contemporary society. I found the charts informative and easy to follow and I highly recommend this book to all interested in business and those who want to be successful.
B00005JKCF|5.0|Almost...in the sense that it is not my belief that the creations of human beings can be perfect.<br />Having said that, there are several human creations that approach perfection: the Tao Te Ching; Van Morrison's Astral Weeks; those incredible paintings Van Gogh did right before he died; Jack Daniels bourbon. <br />Spider-Man is on that level.<br />No, really. For what it is, it's just that good.<br />Okay, I can hear a couple of criticisms to such (seemingly!) ridiculous hyperbole, so I'll take a shot at answering them.<br />#1: \\"It's a friggin' super-hero movie!\\"<br />And your point is...? That's like saying The Searchers is a friggin' Western, or that 2001 is a friggin' sci-fi flick. Guys, I'm gonna say this one more time: quality IS NOT a function of genre. Just because an artist chooses to work within a given generic framework does not mean he doesn't have anything to say. Not all the great filmmakers have unpronounceable names or have been dead for 20-plus years (many of them have, but that's a subject for another review).<br />#2: \\"It's a friggin' soap opera!\\"<br />Sure it is. So's the book of Genesis. So are many of Shakespeare's plays. As one of Spidey's co-creators used to put it, \\"Nuff said\\".<br />****<br />Listen, here's what I know. Spider-Man is, hands down, the best super-hero movie I've ever seen, both in terms of faithfulness to its source material and simply as a piece of cinema. It is, for lack of a better (or more appropriate) way of describing it, like BEING INSIDE OF a super-hero comic, which, fine films that they are, is more than I can say of either Tim Burton's Batman or Bryan Singer's X-Men. It's one of the best sf/fantasy films I've ever seen in my life. Hell, it's one of the best films I've seen in the last ten years, of ANY kind (and I've seen A LOT of films in the last ten years). It's a (literally) wonderful parable for our time and, I think, for all time.<br />Aw, just go see it. Then you'll know what I'm going on about.
B00004NHCC|5.0|I first heard this album in 1955, when I came home on leave from the Navy. My friend Nicky had it, and we listened to it together.I was only 18 years old then. It was the first time I had heard Clifford Brown play. Sarah of course, Iwas already hip to. The other musicians, like Jimmy Jones, Herbie Mann, and i beleive Paul Quinichette; I had certainly heard before. Let me just say this: This is one of the greatest Jazz recordings that I have ever heard. Sarah just destroys me altogether! Cliff Brown did some of the finest trumpet playing that i've ever heard in my entire life. Let me tell you this: I've been digging jazz for at least 45 years. Probably besides Miles and Dizzy, Cliff was truely one of the greats. It's really a shame that he died so young. This album should be a collector's item. Jazz fans everywhere: BUY IT!!!
B00005T30L|5.0|A study of contemporary alienation among the young and not so young that alternates the sad and funny and often mixes the two. The film's central character (played by Thora Birch) graduates from High School to find herself floating in a summer adrift in the adult world. Uncommonly alive and intelligent, she realizes the conventional search for happiness asks not too much but too little. Although she might recoil from the description, she is an idealist who finds it hard to contort herself into society's compromises. She blurts out things like \\"Everyone's stupid!\\" and even starts to grow apart from her more level-headed long-time friend. She meets a soul mate of sorts (Steve Buscemi), older if little wiser who is at least functional even if he hardly fits in. Together they search for the authentic and novel in life and art, disdaining the narrowness of \\"success\\" be it money, status or the praise of a High School art teacher. Both are dismayed with the soullessness they see around them and both have little idea of what to replace it with other than nihilism and withdrawal. After all, what is alienation but a lack of empathy? Instead of reaching out she strikes out and he buries himself within. This is the sadness of the picture that ends up overwhelming the comedy, effective though that is. The film didn't make me laugh as much as Election (also starring Miss Birch) but the quality of its internal scenery makes it equally worthwhile.
B00005YXZH|4.0|To those of you unfamiliar with Wilco, they are truly one of America's greatest bands. Jeff Tweedy is nothing short of a genius. YHF features hauntingly beautiful songs that are mostly dark and ofttimes forboding - both lyrically and instrumentally. There's not a trace of the alt/country sound that worked so well in Being There. They've also jettisonned mush of the dissonance and distortion that creeps into their albums and is featured in their live performances, instead giving the melodies and lyrics the spotlight. None of these songs will ever be classics, but this is definitely the band's most consistent and complete effort to date. You may not love it on first listen, but it will grow on you and I can't imagine any serious listener feeling that the purchase was not money well spent.
B00005JKLZ|4.0|Despite of its mediocre review that this movie has received, I still find this movie quite interesting. Although I will have to admit that last quarter of the movie can use more work in terms of story.<br />Having known a few people working on the visual effects shot of this movie, and being a visual effect artist myself, the time lapse effects done by Digital Domain are just phenomenal. Thus for visual effect students, this movie is definitely worth a close observation. Kudo to Digital Domain.
B0000636UN|5.0|Sheryl really rocks on this album.  It was definitely worth waiting for.  It runs the gammut of rock, folk, and pop.  I've had it in my cd player nonstop since I bought it.  The lyrics are great in Weather Channel but my favorite song is Steve McQueen.  If you like female vocalists, this album is for you!
B00005OAIE|5.0|John Mayer's music is something special in today's market of pop music and angst filled or angry music.  His music pulls back to the basics... great guitar and great lyrics.  <BR>There's something about his playing that doesn't sound to complex for the listener but is by no means simple.  It's catchy and yet impressive.  The lyrics themselves compliment the music because they are so thoughtful and real.  They're emotional without being sappy.<BR>This music pulls you in and touches your soul.  It reminds me of how music was before all the technology to fix things and the vast pop marketing.  Just music that makes you stop and listen and words that touch your soul.
0064400018|5.0|I think the beginning of this book is the best place to start. It explains who Mary and Laura and Baby Carrie and Pa and Ma are, what their house is like and what their life is like. Many other parts of the book are equally wonderful: Mary and Laura playing dolls with the vegetables in the attic; the sugaring-off dance at Grandpa's, and the warm snugness of the little house. As a child I especially liked the chapter about the bears.

B000005ILF|5.0|This album gets 5 stars because of &quot;I Was Brought To My Senses.&quot; Even if every other song on the album was completely awful, this one brings everything to redemption. It contains lines from Tennyson and multiple images from nature and history, and is one of the most beautiful poems he ever wrote.<br />But it gets better...some of the other songs are good, too! &quot;The Hounds of Winter&quot; has some neat background rhythms. I didn't especially like &quot;All Four Seasons&quot; until I found out he had written it for his youngest daughter--&quot;that's my baby, she can be all four seasons in one day&quot;--and after that I loved it; it all clicked into place. &quot;Let Your Soul Be Your Pilot&quot; and &quot;Lithium Sunset&quot; and &quot;Valparaiso&quot; are great as well. Also, the singles from this album have GORGEOUS B-sides. Worth the listen!
B00005R2M3|3.0|I heard &quot;Whenever, Wherever&quot; and absolutely loved it, not because of Shakira's amazing vocals but because the song was something new and different.  I don't know about anybody else, but I saw &quot;Being Shakira&quot; on VH1 and on that show she sang along with the radio, and she was soo good.  She sounded like any other pop singer and sounded almost like Jessica Simpson with a deeper, more alto-y sound.  I don't know why she did these kind of vocals on her album but, just to let you know, she can sing better than she does on &quot;Laundry Service&quot;.
0783232039|3.0|but never the less very likeable and funny. Chucky (Brad Dourif) gets his funniest script yet. The eariler &quot;Child's Play&quot; is a lot smarter I thought. If you want to see this movie, but have not seen the other &quot;Child Play's&quot; yet I suggest you see them first. That way your more up to date on what is really going on. The movies highligt in my opinion was how much this movie made creative use from James While's untochauble classic &quot;The Birde of Frankenstien&quot;. This is certainly worth renting and watching(not buying) in my opinion, but I still would not recommend this to just anyone.
B00005YXZH|5.0|This is, without a doubt, the most interesting and accomplished album the band has put forth to date.  It might sound strange, but its dawned on me that this is the first time, possibly ever, that Jeff seems totally comfortable with the sound of his own music. <br />Each album has been an artistic step forward, but the music never fully sounded like their own.  &quot;AM&quot; was a breezy set of bar-band tunes, &quot;Being There&quot; felt like an homage to someone's record collection, and &quot;Summerteeth&quot; gave the impression of a self-conscious (though not totally successful) attempt to not sound countryish anymore (and an ode to Brian Wilson).  But despite those criticisms, each was magnificent in its own way, and Jeff's lyrics have generally continued to improve over time.  And so, given all the turmoil and personnel shifts that have accompanied this record, its surprising to notice the band coming together as a more cohesive and original-sounding whole.<br />Being a longtime fan of the band, I really hate to say this about Ken, but switching drummers might be the biggest step forward this band has taken.  Ken is a fine roots-rock drummer--but that's also a limitation.  When the band has tried to move away from that genre in the past, something never quite sounded totally right.  In my opinion, it was the rhythm section.  Whether trying to &quot;rock&quot; or fill out the more spacy jams, something always sounded too rigid to my ears.  This new record finally breaks that trend.  This album isn't as mind-bogglingly revolutionary as some might have you believe, but it is a revelation in terms of the band's development.<br />Some will always find faults, of course.  I, myself, am one of those who have been a follower since the UT days--tho not so much a disciple of the Alt-Country camp as some.  And I'll admit that I used to feel myself mentally &quot;fighting&quot; the band with some of their releases.  The shiny power-pop of &quot;Summerteeth&quot;, in particular, really took a long time for me to warm to because there was a part of me that still wanted Jeff to start banging out punk rock again.  Obviously, that's not going to happen.  Nor is he going to go back to singing Carter Family tunes to appease the country crowd.  He's on his own trip now and that's great.  &quot;Misunderstood&quot; and &quot;Sunken Treasure&quot; were bold statements for the band at the time of their release (and they were my favorite moments on BT) and I'm thrilled to see Wilco following down that twisty path.  <br />Keep up the good work, guys!
B000062XFG|1.0|Season Two of Star Trek: The Next Generation is in my opinion, the worst of what is ultimately one of my favorite television programs.  First of all, there was a writer's strike at the beginning of the season, and a great deal of the episodes had thrown together scripts from the never-realised Star Trek II Series.  Apparently the staff behind the scenes was in turrmoil as well, and this reflected on screen.  The most important reason why I hate season two is because of what is known as the <br />\\"Great Doctor Experiment\\" or something like that.  As a young girl when the series began, I found Gates McFadden's portrayel of Dr. Crusher to be inspiring.  I didn't feel that way about the other female characters at the time.  Tasha Yar was far too butch, and it took a couple of seasons for the character of Troi to develop into a useful character.  To replace likable Dr. Beverly Crusher with that crusty old Pulaski was a terrible mistake.  She ruined the show, and I refuse(d) to watch any episode with her in it.  Thankfully the powers that be came to their senses for season three, which I consider one of the best seasons of ST:TNG.  For me, the show really became entertaining and just good from season three on.  The second season finale was a Star Trek rarity of flashbacks, and it ended what was a pathetic season.
B00005RYLE|3.0|I almost laugh myself to death whenever I see this movie, it is excellent, funny and by far the superior of the series.  However, it is expensive for a 20 year old movie, regardless of the pretty packaging and extra features.  ...P>However, it is nice to see the movie uncut for the first time in a while, it has been to long since the full version was available in the UK.
B000060P79|5.0|If youre into bands like Good Charlotte, Green Day, or Blink 182 then you should definitely get Simple Plan's album. Especialy if you like Blink and Good Charlotte, since some of those guys guest star in this album. Addicted,My Alien, and God Must Hate Me are just a few of the great songs on this album. If you love new punk music then you need to get this album.

B00004X0ER|5.0|All I hear about is how this band isn't creative and sounds like other bands.  Well maybe they've picked up stuff along the way, but the way the singer Pete puts so much emotion into every song gives this band its own prestige and originality.  I'm a fan of just about every other band that sounds like the Hives.  The Hives are the best out of all of them.  The Strokes are good, so are the White Stripes, but man does this guy really sing with his heart.  And all those old bands are old so that means that they have no creditability because old things ..., its just a fact, The Stooges singer whatever his name is ... and can't sing ... and has no voice.  The Hives are law, just remember that and you'll do fine.
B00005K9LK|5.0|1982...what a year!  The two best (by far) albums to come out then: KISS - \\"Creatures Of The Night\\" and Judas Priest - \\"Screaming For Vengeance.\\"  This was my first buy of anything from the Priest back in '82 and I would recommend with all the new remasters that are coming out today that this be your first taste of the Priest.  This disc opens up with one of the best guitar intros from the best guitar combo of Glenn Tipton and K.K. Downing.  \\"The Hellion\\" is a thrust into the the groove-laden, vocal piercing concert favorite \\"Electric Eye.\\"  Rob Halford's vocals throughout this disc sound just like the title!  Also, Ian Hill on Bass and Dave Holland on drums keep the backbone of the band pounding.  Other hits worth checking out are \\"Riding On The Wind\\"...which might I add has one of the coolest rollercoaster-like guitar solos, \\"You've Got Another Thing Comin'\\"...this song has heavy guitar groove written all over it and is still today a popular metal song, \\"Devil's Child\\"...a dark devilish closer!  This is one of those discs that I can listen from beginning to end without skipping a song.  You won't be disappointed with \\"Vengeance!\\"
B00005QIPH|4.0|Wow, critics and fans get really worked up about the virtues of this album. Sneered at by some critics as populist tripe, and adored by everyone else, this album has clearly touched a nerve somewhere.<br />Is it enjoyable? Very much. Is it amazing and genre-pushing? No.<BR>You will enjoy it anyway, like a snickers bar or fast food. It is tasty, disposable, and fast.
B00005JLEX|5.0|I don't watch very much TV, but I do catch the Seinfeld reruns nightly.  I never missed it when it was in first run.  We want and NEED Seinfeld, The DVD (complete set) NOW.  PLEASE!  I need to think about \\"nothing.\\"
B00000G3I2|5.0| I've loved this film since day one, and still do...just recently bought the DVD. One thing that bugs me incredibly, though, is that the big flashback scene alluded to by Director Lawrence Kasdan, is not included! Does no one know that that is the very scene everyone wants to see? Is it being kept for another dvd release later? Was Costner's price too high? What is the deal???
B000002UAR|5.0|Many people have listed 'Revolver' as the most important and influential album of all time.  More than Nirvana's 'Nevermind,' more than Dylan's 'Highway 61,' and even more than the Beatles' own 'Sgt. Pepper.'  That's pretty high praise.<br />So why this album?  First, the lyrics are filled with much more depth than previous Beatle albums.  Just listen to the biting criticism in &quot;Taxman&quot; and the painful loneliness of &quot;Eleanor Rigby,&quot; for example.  Second, the boys were experimenting with new sounds.  While the experimentation here is not as unusual as that of 'Sgt. Pepper,' 'Revolver's songs mix and match various types of sounds that were at the time more accepted, but also very different from what everyone else was doing.  You'll find a string quartet on &quot;Eleanor Rigby,&quot; sitar and tabla on &quot;Love You To,&quot; horns on &quot;For No One&quot; and &quot;Got to Get You Into My Life.&quot;  Not exactly ground-breaking stuff, even for 1966, but very well done.  And like all Beatles albums, after hearing it, you want to hear more.<br />With 'Revolver,' we were able to see for the first time a clear distinction between Lennon's songs (&quot;She Said She Said,&quot; &quot;And Your Bird Can Sing,&quot; &quot;Tomorrow Never Knows&quot;) and McCartney's songs (&quot;Good Day Sunshine,&quot; &quot;Here, There and Everywhere,&quot; &quot;Eleanor Rigby&quot;).  It's not really fair to say Lennon wrote the great lyrics and McCartney wrote the great melodies, but on 'Revolver' you can see the direction that each writer was headed toward.  <br />So how do you describe 'Revolver' to someone who has never heard it?  Fresh.  Energetic.  Clever.  Inventive.  Thoughtful.  Playful.  Fun....<br />Great.
B00000J6AG|5.0|there is not a single track on this album that i don't like. the album can be described a modern classical music so all of u hard working people who like to listen to some relaxing music with excellent composition and short but meaningful lyrics, this is the album for you. I cant say more than that. is there anything u americans are bad at?? i thought us euripeans led the way with dance music
0783225547|3.0|This 1997 movie came out around the same time Tommy Lee Jones' movie \\"Volcano\\" did too. This one is better. I might be a little biased because this movie was filmed about 45 miles or so away from where I live. I guess I have a case of favoritism going on here. Pierce Brosnan(Bond, James Bond)stars as a volcano expert named Harry Dalton from the U.S. Geological Survey who is taken to the small, quaint, picturesque town of Dante's Peak, when there is evidence of an active volcano. He meets Rachel Wando, the town's mayor(played by Linda Hamilton)and alerts her that her town is in danger. Not everyone, including some of Harry's co-workers, think there is imminent danger. Oh they would be wrong. So wrong. Before you can say 'Mt. St. Helens', the volcano erupts and the town is in it's warpath. Ash flies everywhere, lava destroying everything in it's path, steaming lakes, mudslides, flooding. You name it. This is a disaster film and they throw in plenty of disaster. The effects in this movie are really awesome. If anything, there's that. It's very realistic and pulled off very nicely. Trees and buildings being incinerated look really good. For me, the best sequence in the film is when Pierce, Linda, her kids, and Grandma are traveling across the steaming lake in the little boat and the boat is slowly being eaten away. Great suspense in this intense and nerve racking scene. Pierce Brosnan is a charming presence, and is pretty believeable in his role as a volcano expert. Linda Hamilton doesn't whip out the finely tuned muscles she had in \\"Terminator 2\\", but she holds her own. Nicely cast as a mother and mayor of a small town. Charles Hallahan, who will best be remembered as the captain in the \\"Hunter\\" TV series also stars. I got the chance to drive over to this town and saw some stuff being filmed. I caught a brief glimpse of Linda Hamilton, but nothing great. I saw Pierce's chair. I was there to see the filming of the town racing out of the school as the volcano erupted andthe church steeple crumbled over and smashed into the school bus. It was a great sight to behold. This was in Wallace, Idaho. This isn't a monumental film that most people will probably remember afterwards. It's pure Hollywood entertainment in every way. It's fun, exciting, and it is very entertaining. That's what we expect with a film like this and that is exactly what we get.
B00003CXI1|5.0|I am surprised and pleased at the outcome of this movie. I certainly relished reading the books because of the pictures I could paint in my mind, but I also enjoyed watching those characters come to life. I thought Ron, Harry, and Hermione were perfect for their roles! As a teacher, I can only hope the movie will inspire more kids to read the remainder of the books.  To those people who think this inspires witchcraft....read it with an open mind!  This is a book about fantasy.  It does not promote evil in any way, shape or form...
0714834491|5.0|This book will open your eyes to a world you never knew existed. Superficially it appears to be the Seinfeld of the literary world, that is a book about nothing. The book appears to be a random collection of quotes and anecdotes on seemingly unrelated topics.<br />I like this book because it covers such a diverse range of topics in an interesting manner. You can open up virtually any page in the book and find something amusing, thought provoking or plain bizarre. As an example did you realise that in actuality the world is a very dull place? There is no such thing as colour or sound. These are simply waves with different wavelengths and frequencies. The sensation of light and sound is simply the brain parsing information in a specific way, probably because this model was conducive to survival in primitive times.<br />I must admit a lot of the pages in the book were quite beyond me. I didn't understand why they were there at all and in fact I feel that some of the material should be omitted from the book because it has little value. It also became annoying at times because you have to flip the book sideways and upside down due to its unusual layout (no easy feat with such a hefty tome!).<br />However all in all this book is an excellent read. One of the best books I've read in awhile. Highly recommended if you are interested in exploring the unusual and thinking outside the square.
B00005Y228|4.0|I was actually surprised when I listened through the entire album and enjoyed every song.  Usually you can't look at an album cover that looks like it's from some supermodel's photo shoot and expect to take the music seriously.  Luckily with Kylie, you don't have to.<BR>Every song is energetic and fun, with a unique dance beat and subtle harmonies.  With a lot of albums that feature electronic/dance music, the songs all sound the same, and after 4 or 5 tracks, you lose all patience and have to turn it off.  Not this one.  Each song is actually different enough from the previous one that when the album is done playing, you actually wish it weren't.<BR>Lyrically and musically, I think this album shows more talent and originality than most pop music you hear on the radio.  \\"In Your Eyes\\" stands out as my personal favorite.  Unfortunately, while I enjoyed the rest of the songs, I wasn't really fanatical about them and don't really expect to listen to them more than occasionally.
B00003CXE7|3.0|By this point, it is ridiculous to write another review for \\"Gladiator\\" (Right now it has around 1300 reviews), but if you're reading this and considering buying it, please do yourself a favor and rent it instead.<br />It's a good popcorn flick that makes a great rental, especially to watch with friends. Everybody has already mentioned the dazzling visuals, so I need not go on further. Great action, great fight scenes.<br />But the acting ranges from melodramatic to slightly less melodramatic, and the script is pure cheesiness at its worst. The movie has no depth at all, which is why most sane people question why it won an Oscar for Best Picture. The lesson in this movie is \\"If you have a problem, kill somebody.\\" They say this (almost literally) several times within the movie, which just makes it seem like it was conceived/written by a six year old.<br />If you are just looking for some action scenes, then here ya go. Everything else is sold separately.
B000006TRV|5.0|The wall is the story of the rock star PINK FLOYD. As he sits in his hotel room staring at the TV he remembers his life. Pinks father died when pink was very young, he remembers this as a great depression in his life not being able to consult a father figure, he also remembers how the school teachers had taunted him and all the other students. All this builds up to a trial where people from his life witness against him and he is sentenced to be exposed.<BR>A master peice, one of the first concept albums and the album that pathe the way for other concept albums such as NIN's the downword spiral wich has the exact same concept. I myself own the movie and I can tell you that it is, hence the lack of text, one of the most depressing films ever. Now for all of you who have heard The Wall I can tell you that The Wall is pinks memories and thoughts that all add up too a large, yes you geust it, Wall betwine him and the rest of the world. So if you want to start listening to Pink Floyd don't buy their best of buy this, just pop it in the CD player and prepare to be amazed
B00003CX8N|5.0|Read the book before you see the movie.  I think you'll agree that the forward written by Anne Bancroft is as touching a story as the book itself.  Her passion for this book is clear in her performance, but how she came to play the part is an incredible love story.  As I've always suspected, Mel is the MAN!
B00005Q66T|5.0|I think it was a great idea to release this. As a sort of follow-up from her \\"Imacculate Collection\\" it shows off hermost popular songs of the last 10 years:<br />1.

B00013RC8O|5.0|Great casting, great story, super movie. I could go on and on about why it is great, but others have done that. Just watch this movie and see for yourself.
B00005QHPQ|4.0|I recently purchased this album mainly for Enrique's latest single &quot;Escape.&quot; This is my favorite song from him so far and I enjoy his vocals on it. Of course, the other familiar song is &quot;Hero.&quot; It was massacred by radio after 9/11 (although why this song became famous becuz of it, I will never know.) I also enjoy the song &quot;I Will Survive&quot; (and no, it's not a Gloria Gaynor cover.) My biggest dislike is &quot;Don't Turn Off the Lights.&quot; I pray it's not released as the next single. The Sanish versions of &quot;Escape&quot; and &quot;Hero&quot; are nice additions also.
0385505833|1.0|This book would play out better on the movie screen.  The sadness of the story could be laughable on the screen, but on paper, it becomes a drag.  Don't bother reading it.
B000002KCV|5.0|While there are more than enough individual tracks dotted around his huge number of recordings to justify Neil Young's major reputation there are only a few albums that, on their own, hold together as satisfyingly complete \\"works\\". And... in the (self imposed) absence of any sensible retrospectives since 1977's \\"Decade\\" (definitely the best place to start for any \\"casual buyer\\") those not \\"in the know\\" could be in for some serious mistakes. So, what's been worth the money since then? Well...for anyone looking for the mellower side of this brilliantly mercurial but annoyingly erratic artist here's a few suggestions: \\"Comes a Time\\" (1978), \\"Freedom\\" (1989), \\"Harvest Moon\\" (1992) and \\"Unplugged\\" (1995).<br />\\"Comes a Time\\" - his first post \\"Decade\\" release - was also Neil Young's first serious attempt to recapture the audience created by \\"After the Goldrush\\" & \\"Harvest\\". Concentrating on the acoustic folk/country-rock aspects of both albums, and arguably more cohesive than either, it opens with the exquisite \\"Goin' Back\\" - one of the most emotionally reflective songs he has delivered to date - followed by the wonderfully catchy, pure country of \\"Comes a Time\\", the tougher, Crazy Horse backed \\"Look Out For My Love\\" and two beautiful ballads in \\"Lotta Love\\" (a top ten hit for backing singer Nicolette Larson) & \\"Peace of Mind\\". From there on the album flows fairly seamlessly through a set of similarly gentle, albeit less powerful, country & folk songs - with the stand out fun-blues of \\"Motorcycle Mama\\" providing a perfectly positioned break - to leave you... happy. Money well spent!
B00005JKJA|1.0|I am a huge fan of imagery and surealism. However, this film wore down my patience. There is no way to ever completely understand a Lynch film. The enjoyment in his work comes from mood and intrigue. Mulholland drive did not have nearly enough intrigue to compensate for the lack of logic. Scenes were strung together in a frusterating order. I kept anticipating some funtctional link tying previous scenes together. But as the movie went on, all the audience is treated to is mindless vignettes that only confuse the plot until the only sensible explanation to what you are watching, is that Lynch wrote the script after waking up from a dream. A very tedious dream at that.
0380789035|5.0|I've read everything that Gaiman has put out so far. I've been a follower of the Sandman for years. I feel that I need to defend Gaiman in a few aspects where he has been slammed by other reviewers.<br />One thing that must be remembered is that while some of is wording seems strange and may take a second reading, he is writing as a British man, and not an American one. Americans and the British have a tendency to diverge on phrasing. Granted, he is writing about Americans, he still is not one, was not educated in America, and therefore was not raised with the language technique used in America.<br />Also, Gaiman is being called &quot;too creative&quot;. When in fact, this is not the first book to feature gods and their interactions with humans and other gods. Give Gaiman some credit for having a unique idea and then researching it. There was an incredible amount of background knowledge that had to have been gained before the book could be written accurately.<br />Take the book for what it is--entertainment, and give the man some credit for his effort. Or, in the alternative, write your own book and try to make it better than Gaiman's.
B000003TA4|3.0|Well. When I listened to this cd for the first time I didnt like it very much. then I gave it another listen and another. Like most reviews say this is the album that changed the music buisness forever or anything like it. I agree it changed a lot of things but doesnt mean it necceserely good album. This album has its moments like all LPs. But many things seems to be missing. some of the songs here sound a bit ya ya and other just hang on the album back cover. I dont know but I think Nirvana was really<BR>an overrated band and Kurt Cobain a maybe overrated artist. Its not like I hate Nirvana but many of their stuff wasnt that groundbreaking. If you listen to the other grunge album from that Era or the bands like Pearl Jam, Soundgarden or Alice In Chains. they had something really important to say which was the goal that Kurt Cobain wanted to do but didnt reach to all the people except the teenyboppers and the young kids who buy Limp Bizkit or Linkin Park albums to day. They werent the best musicians but they werent terrible. And with the whole thing that Kurt was the man in the group and he was Nirvana is and was not true. He wrote all the songs for the Bleach album and In Utero album but on this one . Their most succesful and best produced album this album was their all. Kirk Novesellic and Dave Grohl gave all that they had on this album just like Kurt did. Even more as I see all the Interwievs that they did I think Novesellic was indeed the spokesman, the best composer and the best musician. I think this album is overrated and In Utero is much better but not for as widespread audience as Nevermind. Still Nevermind is good but not as good as you may think. And By the way I never heard any haribands nor glossy teen pop in 91 becaue it was fading out as the alternative exploision was hummering and it wasnt Nirvana who started it. Thank You.

B00002R0MC|5.0|The best CD i own. This CD is a complete collection of Bob Marley's work from Judge Not to his final live song 'Redemption Song'. There is no better collection or album around than this, although it costs a little more, it will save you buying six or seven of bob's albums in the long run.  Look out for the original limited edition (1,000,000 made)in the original box set from 1992. This is a rare find if you see one for sale.  CD three is the best although on disc 2 there are seven fantastic acoustic versions of his songs that cannot be found anywhere else.  This box set is a must for every bob marley...... no....  music lover.  <BR>There are also a thousand collectors editions knocking around signed by Rita Marley, include the original box set, Legend CD, Natural Mystic CD and a hardback copy of the Songs of Freedom book all packaged in a gift box set these things are worth a mint.<BR>Although the CDs come in several different packages, any one of them is worth buying because of the excellent quality and selection of music on them.<br />Happy Listening
0613325419|5.0|\\"Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them\\" truly is an excellent companion to the Harry Potter books. <BR>Written in J.K. Rowling's consistantly humorous style, the book is interesting, and to prevent the information from becoming boring, there are lots of funny remarks and comments supposedly \\"written\\" by Harry Potter and Ron Weasley, two of the Harry Potter books' main characters. <BR>It is also fascinating - if you observe the book carefully, you will see how much effort has been put into it to make it look like it really DID come right out from Harry's world. <br />This book is a must for Harry Potter fans everywhere, but should only be read after completing the main books, as otherwise it will not be as easy to understand. Also, from purchasing this book, you will have the pleasure of knowing that you have helped a great cause, no matter where you might be.
B000060N8U|3.0|C'mon C'mon is a very sunny album, from its yellow-tinted cover photos and inside photos showing Ms. Crow (often looking like a completely different person, oddly enough) in sunny outdoors poses to the music itself, which often bears a distinct Rolling Stones good-times vibe, even when the lyrics are anything but happy sounding.<br /><br />Ironically, the album's highlights may be its two quietest songs, \\"Safe and sound\\" and \\"Weather channel\\". Many will remember \\"Safe and sound\\" from the star-studded-yet-somber televised benefit aired shortly after the events of September 11; the album version features a fuller arrangement, but remains evocative. \\"Weather channel\\", which features guest vocals by Emmylou Harris, perfectly depicts the frame of mind of someone who has not yet begun to get over the end of a relationship. It also stands out from the rest of the album by view of the simplicity of its acoustic guitar-based arrangement.<br /><br />\\"Missing\\" is the best of the three extra tracks on this edition, though Stevie Nicks fans might prefer \\"You're not the one\\", which not only features guest vocals from Ms. Nicks, but was also co-written by her.<br /><br />Overall, this album will undoubtedly be played at summer barbecues all over the place, as it's got just the right sound for sunny-day listening enjoyment.<br /><br />One or two stars off for the \\"make-it-loud-for-radio\\" over-use of compression in mastering, however. My ears became fatigued halfway through, and I found myself actually turning the volume *down*, not up. You can't crank it if it's already been cranked, folks...

B000002AZ8|4.0|It's funny that when I bought this back in '94, I thought it was total ...  I liked _Ten_ and loved _Vs_, but _Vitology_ sounded totally different to me--and not in a good way.  Songs like \\"Pry, To\\", \\"Bugs\\", \\"Aye Davanita\\" and \\"Hey Foxymophandlemama, That's Me\\" (a.k.a. \\"Stupid Mop\\"), in conjunction with the weird CD packaging indicated [or so I thought] that they were trying too hard to be \\"artists\\".  After a few listens, I exiled the disc to the Do Not Play pile.<br />I refused to purchase any subsequent PJ albums, fearing that they had abandoned their hard \\"alt-rock\\" style permanently.  My [erroneous] conclusion was reaffirmed by others' sharp criticism of _No Code_, and I had heard no feedback whatsoever on \\"Yield\\"--so I figured PJ was on its way out.<br />But several months ago, a co-worker brought in _Live On Two Legs_ for me to check out.  I thought it was fairly decent, and I noticed that there were a few Vitology tracks (\\"Corduroy\\", \\"Nothingman\\", \\"Better Man\\") on the disc that--much to my surprise--were really good.  So I picked up that exiled copy of _Vitology_ and popped it into my CD-player.  It was like finding [money] in the pocket of some old jeans.  And I couldn't really understand why I thought it was ... in the first place.  Maybe back then I was expecting _Vs Continued_ or something...<br />The weird songs are still weird, but they're kind of amusing, if you don't take them seriously.  And there's enough meat on the CD to feel satisfied with your purchase.  Plus, it's not really *that* different from the first two albums--there's a mix of fast/hard and slow/soft, and it's all quality PJ.  <br />So now I have copies of _No Code_ and _Yield_, and let me tell you, they're not bad either.  I still have yet to pick up _Binaural_, but I will eventually.  In the meantime, I've satisfied myself with 4 shows from PJ's bootleg series, which I highly recommend for a mix of old and new stuff.  If you're not sure about _Vitology_ or _No Code_ (the two most controversial PJ albums, it seems), pick up a live CD or two and see what you think.
B000001FRY|5.0|Back in 1980, 70s rock was fading away, and synthesizer-laden, new wave music was starting to hit the scene.  Another genre that was starting to come forward was punk.  Bono has said that \\"at heart, we're a punk band.\\"  Now for most fans of All That You Can't Leave Behind, this may be a bunch of [stuff], but if you listen to Boy, you really see U2's punk roots.  Bono also says a lot about how he admired The Ramones and how they influenced them.  There is not one track on this debut album that is bad.  Even though this album is not as creative or as diverse as their later offerings, since almost every song on here is just guitars, bass, drums, and vocals, no synthisizers, loops, or anything, this is one that you have to buy.  Although if you're a new U2 fan I suggest buying Joshua Tree first, then Achtung Baby, then All That You Can't Leave Behind for a base of their critically acclaimed albums.  Then, venture into their less acclaimed stuff, such as War, October, The Unforgettable Fire, Zooropa, Pop (which most say was a flop but I disagree), and of course Boy.  So there's my two cent review.
B00005QZWI|4.0|Most of the songs are average to above average in quality, and seem to fit the movie well......My favorites are the ones with Enya *blush*, but what can I say? I think weird..........I think Enya does a great representation of elvish beauty.
B00005OAIE|1.0|Ok, so John can play guitar like few people I've ever seen.  This album makes absolutely NO show of that.  You wouldn't know him from Hootie with his guitar work here.  For all of his chops, I expect more for my money when buying his album.<br />As far as his songwriting goes, John is in his early 20's, and he can't seem to get over how horrible high school was.  &quot;No Such Thing&quot; is a trite number about how he's gonna &quot;show them-&quot; he'll go back to his high school and stand on the tables and say, &quot;look at me, I'm a famous musician.&quot;  If only his intellect were as powerful as his arrogance, then maybe that song would've turne out more as retrospect rather than revenge.  The rest are more of the same- catchy numbers with less depth than the kiddie pool.  If he would spend some time on his songs and try and write with some genuine feeling rather than trying to make his 14-20 year-old audience swoon, then he would truly be something to write home about.<br />As of now, save your dough- John's just a Backstreet Boy with a guitar.
B000062TU1|4.0|This was great fun for the viewer who has read the books.  Can't wait for the remainder of the movies to be released.  For those who say that HARRY POTTER is evil, I say: get a life, get a grip, get an education, hide your ignorance and quit spreading your religio-cult fanatic fantasies around to simply scare others because you are too terrified to live life in the actual real world.
0743420373|3.0|I found this book to be very insightful and informative, as well as an easy read.  Stanley and Danko prove themselves to be experts in their field, and I feel that I can trust their great advice.  This book is perfect for those who are very hardworking and fiercely determined to actually become a successful millionaire.
B0000214F0|5.0|This film approaches Ancient Rome in a way that not even Frederico Fellini's \\"Satyricon\\" was able: With an X-Rating. A star-studded cast is displayed surrounded by sumptuously filmed soft and hard core .... A gorgeous film, steeped with decadence, sadism, incest, and ART. A work of beauty, but not for your Grandmother's viewing tastes, very probably. ;-)
B00003CXTG|2.0|This could have been a great movie, but it ultimately is a long, arduous picture.  The events surrounding the bombing of Pearl Harbor are dramatic in and of themselves - the silly love story doesn't add anything except an extra hour.  This is just another Bruckheimer/Michael Bay flick - Armageddon in the 40's.  Same generic characters, same generic Zimmer score, same generic shots of tough guys looking cool in slow motion.<br />On the plus side, the picture quality and sound of this DVD are absolutely top notch.  It's almsot worth getting just to watch the half an hour sequens of the bombing of Pearl Harbor.  If you have a decent home theater setup, this will really give it a workout.
0385503954|5.0|&quot;Atonement&quot; is not just one story, but three wonderfully threaded parts that combine into a powerfully moving whole. The story is so rich and epic in it's mere 350 pages, I wanted it to just keep going. I knew nothing about the plot before I started and I think the less you know the better.McEwan has created a wonderful collection of characters whose actions will shock and provoke as you witness their folley. Brilliant as well is his descriptive prowess of not just the English countryside, but of the horrors of war.This is the best book I've read so far this year.
B000050FEN|4.0|David Fincher seemed too preoccupied in making the definitive serial killer movie. It's evident he had his sights set on surpassing, &quot;The Silence of the Lambs.&quot;  Not even close.  As a matter of fact I thought &quot;Manhunter&quot; was a superior movie.  Don't get me wrong Seven is a great movie, but not in the same league of Hannibal the Cannibal.
6305090564|4.0|This happens to be my favriote movie.  None of my folks exept my parents ever seen it.  But they would get a chill of this movie.  No the reason why I gave it 4 stars is because there could be added sound affects.  Like when in the beginning they showed words of what happened they couldve transfer it to the envoirment of the movie.  More scary chilling affects could have been added as well.  the villains deserve what was coming to them execpt its a shame that black guy, not the one with the....SPOILER....ax stuck to his head by the captain.  The captain was a scum after all to disengaged the ship by imputting the virus disks to dissable the line of communication and knocking everything offline.  What would really give a chill is another spoiler alert.  Do not look if you didn't see the movie<br />When the monster spat billy out without showing the likes that he was swallowed by the creature, they showed him in slime with half of his face was gone.  Showing his hand with a hole in it.  <br />End of spoiler<br />If you havn't seen this movie it would be great to rent it or own it on DVD/VHS.  Its good with the lights out.
0887309372|5.0|Simple, direct points stimulate your thinking and drive straight to the point.  The value in this book isn't so much the &quot;laws&quot; themselves, its what you think about when you read it.
B00000JNO2|3.0|Skynyrd lost a lot when they lost Ed King, whose lovely Stratocaster work was a great asset to the band. They also lost Bob Burns, who I have to admit I prefer as a drummer to Artimus Pyle (even if he had a dull name in comparison!) When this album came out I thought it not nearly as good as its predecessors, but being that I love the band this album will do just fine and it does have some real crackers on it. &quot;Searching&quot; is one of their best and &quot;Cry for the Bad Man&quot; has such a classic riff. The wonderful Allen Collins lead guitar sound on &quot;Gimme back my Bullets&quot; is just A1-pure unadulterated Skynyrd too (how DID he get it?). Live, &quot;The Same Old Blues&quot; was a real killer, but here it is a little perfunctory. Still, hearing the original version by JJ Cale is never the same after hearing this slide guitar laden version. Ronnie van Zandt's vocals are a little embarrassing on &quot;Every Mother's Son&quot; to put it mildly. He always did have a slight tendency to sing flat and they really should have re-recorded the vocals on this one. &quot;Trust&quot; is also a bit of a non-event.  I am always a little touched by &quot;All I Can Do is Write About It&quot;. Here Ronnie's lyrics are direct and straight from the heart. Van Zandt's lyrics will never win any awards for their intellectual quality, but they are demonstrably about something real and they are talking about a life hard lived, not some rock star ego trip. <br />On this album the band do sound a bit tired and as a result the output does not have the same verve or variety as their other albums, but it is still pretty good. Certainly anyone who likes the band will want a copy.
B00005OM4Q|5.0|Cameron Crowe is such a meticulous director, the detail in this movie is like stepping into a time machine and going back to the year 1973!  The movie has a lot of feel to it, you are on this roller-coaster ride right along with the main characters from beginning to end.  Jason Lee, as the egotistical but likeable singer, Jeff Bebe, is my favorite.  I'll have to search out more movies with Jason Lee.  I just love that scene where he's wearing his new Jeff Bebe t-shirt (finally, a t-shirt with a big picture of himself on it!), and he's freaking out over William Miller's portrayal of them in Rolling Stone magazine.  This movie goes from hilarious to sad and back again.  I love that.  For anyone who's curious enough, I recommend reading &quot;Let It Blurt:  the life of Lester Bangs, America's greatest rock critic&quot; (influence and mentor to Cameron Crow), and &quot;Rebel Heart&quot;  by Bebe Buell (one of the girls Crowe met while interviewing bands).
B0000636UN|5.0|This is a great collection of music--my favorite of Sheryl Crow's, so far.  There isn't a bad track on this disc.  It is perfect for a drive to the coast or to a summer picnic because it has a great balance of songs for the mood.  The production is terrific as are the collaborations.  I highly recommend it!
B00003CXZ1|5.0|Tomb Raider is based on a famous video game.  Lara Croft is the famous herione in the game and movie.  Lara Croft is played by (Angelina Jolie).  Angelina is really great in the movie, she is a role model for all girls.  Angelina Jolie looks like the Tomb Raider herself.<br />In the movie Lara Croft is exploring lost empires, finding treasure, and punishing villians.  To get The Triangle of Light.   The Triangle of Light is the power to alter space and time.  It is up to Lara to stop the villians who want the Triangle.<br />Tomb Raider is an action packed movie that you must see. On the DVD, it has games, 4 deleted scenes, and a music video by U2.  The music video is called &quot;Elevation&quot;.  So this movie is great and the video game also great.
B000059HCN|4.0|I rented &quot;Requim for a Dream-rated version&quot; and am just wondering what I had missed. I fell in love with this movie the first time I saw it (and saw it again several times after that), but want to know exactly what I missed out on.......what was exactly deleted? If I fell in love with this movie watching the rated version, I plan to own it as well.......but the full movie. <br />So anyone please e-mail me and let me in on exactly if I missed anything prominent. If not so I could go ahead and buy the version I first rented instead of waiting around for the unedited version. Thanks in advance.
0694525820|5.0|I don't know how I got through junior high without reading this.  I listened to it on tape and loved it.  The author brings the story to life of a young girl and her comming of age story.  It's a classic for all ages and a must read; or listen to.
B000002LFZ|4.0|They are all here. This is the simplest album available with nothing but hit after hit. <br />My only complaint is that it could've included the original version of Silver Springs , which I finally found on the import 2CD The Chain (A nice set , just weird and out of order...) and Love In Store which is also a very nice song. <br />Nothing really else missing here. Just buy this one. You will not be sorry!
0449002632|4.0|One glance at this book might put you off reading it.  London is a long book, but a very rewarding read.  Instead of giving the reader a dull history of the city, Edward Rutherfurd tells the story of several families through the centuries and sets their stories against the history of the city.  It starts with the beginnings of a settlement and traces the growth of London through to modern times.  Rutherfurd makes you care about the families so that you want to know what happens to each successive generation.  This is the first Edward Rutherfurd book I've read and I can't wait to read more.
B000002KHB|4.0|Machine Head is one heck of a display of metal power.  The big radio hit \\"Smoke on the Water,\\" despite its catchy bass line and chorus, is actually the second-weakest track (to \\"Maybe I'm a Leo\\"), but both are still fine songs.  No filler here, and Machine Head contains one of the greatest displays of superpowered rocketing guitar work ever, by Ritchie Blackmore in \\"Highway Star.\\"  He matches and builds on an explosive verseline to create one of the all-time classics of the hard-rock genre.  \\"Pictures of Home\\" is another dynamic blast of raw energy, which is what Deep Purple does so well.  A zippy organ intro sets the table for \\"Lazy,\\" another strong track, and \\"Space Truckin'\\" has an ever-so-cool guitar riff.  To call Machine Head \\"heavy metal\\" might be misleading, because it is superior musically to most of that genre, and is melodically and rhythmically stronger than some of Led Zeppelin's work.  Let's just say Machine Head is one of the best highly-charged hard rock albums you'll come upon, and a must for those interested in something with that characterization.
6305428387|5.0|After watching this movie I found it inspiring, it brings out the spirit of competition in you, but also fills you with a feeling of hope, and desire.  This movie is about the unlikely event of a Jamaican bobsled team competing in the olympics (it actually happened though).  John Candy does a great job of portraying a coach that is disturbed about his past as an olympian, and has become the total opposite of an olympian.  Anyway as the story goes two friends (an olympic sprinter hopeful Darice, and a pushcart driver Sanka) have a plan to form a bobsled team after an olympic trial mishap for Darice that prevented him from going to the summer olympics.  They meet up with two other Jamaicans (who also happen to be the other two sprinters involved in the olympic trial mishap), and  with their future coach (John Candy), and then head off on a hilarious journey to the 1988 Calgary Olympics.  This movie is very hilarious all they way through until the last half hour  when everything catches up with the team, and then the movie takes a sudden heart warming turn that tugs at your heart.  Then to top it all off on the third day something tragic happens, and then the movie truly becomes inspiring, and brings out your spirit of competition.<BR>Anyway enough about the movie, buy it, and enjoy it over and over again.
B000002H38|5.0|Not a single bad song on this album. This is currently my 5th copy of this album and I will not let anybody ever use it again (each time it was lent out never got it back). Every song here speaks from the heart and soul. Very worthwhile and lovely.
B00005JKCF|4.0|This is the first over-hyped blockbuster in ages that was actually better than I had anticipated. Its effectiveness lies not in a reliance on digital effects and explosions (although there's plenty of that) but in its emotional appeal. As Peter Parker (Maguire) tells the audience in the film's opening narration, this is a story about a girl. The maturation of Peter's unrequited love for Mary Jane Watson (Dunst), the troubled girl next door, is the heart of the film. The rest is merely a means to achieving that end.<br />Particularly poignant is a monologue that Peter delivers to Mary Jane when she asks him how Peter described her in a \\"chance meeting\\" with her recent savior, Spider-Man. I don't know whether Maguire was performing David Koepp's script verbatim or not. But it is incredibly romantic.<br />Willem Dafoe was a no-brainer to play the Green Goblin. The script and his performance bring humanity to what could have been a cartoon (pun intended) villain.<br />Many of the effects are spectacular (I want to see it again and try to detect when the costumed Spidey is Maguire and when he's computer software). Some are only a cut above mediocre. But they aren't the reason to see 'Spider-Man.' It's the \\"boy-meets-girl\\" that took me for the ultimate spin.
B000002KBH|4.0|American Beauty is among those Dead studio albums with the most consistently good tracks, which is important for a non-Deadhead like me.  Phil Lesh's \\"Box of Rain\\" is a decent enough beginning, with its tone-setting acoustic guitar.  Then two kickers come in:  \\"Friend of the Devil,\\" a steady-driving piece of acoustic work and one of the group's most tightly performed songs, and the pretty rhythm of Bob Weir's \\"Sugar Magnolia.\\"  \\"Ripple\\" and \\"Truckin\\" are the other stickout tracks.  \\"Ripple\\" is arch-country, a very solid song with great arrrangements and ripping mandolin by David Grisman.  The great rhythms and steady beat of \\"Truckin'\\" combine with the zippy verselines to make it an authentic vicarious highway experience and an excellent finale.  The other songs are not as strong, but all have some redeeming factors (and you can hear Pigpen singing in \\"Operator\\").  However, while there is fairly good harmonic singing in \\"Attics of My Life,\\" the song drags a bit as Jerry gets too full of himself.<BR> <BR>Still, the one factor that is generally lacking in even good Dead songs is excitement, in terms of potency and originality, and that is why I look to good lyrics, in no shortage here, as an additive.  \\"Friend of the Devil\\" and \\"Truckin'\\" roll you from town to town.  Images of nature are broad and elaborate in \\"Box of Rain,\\" while \\"Ripple\\" sprinkles you with water.  But the lyrics to \\"Sugar Magnolia\\" stand by themselves as a gorgeous song-poem, among the most beautiful by the Dead or any group, and make it the strongest number for me.  They are bright and cheerful and laced with natural beauty:  \\"Sweet blossom come on under the willow/We can have high times if you'll abide/We can discover the wonders of nature/Rolling in the rushes down by the riverside.\\"  There are dancing and jumping and sunshine daydreams and ..sugar magnolias.  American Beauty is a beautiful American experience.
B000001Y79|5.0|This cd was the essence of the ska/punk genre, this cd definateley represents the best of the ska/punk mix as well.  Then to top it all off Tragic Kingdom is No Doubt's best release out of all of their albums.  From songs such as Don't Speak and Spiderwebs, Gwen shows off her amazingly strong voice, and does it very well.  From the punk riffs, to the bright ska sound from the horn players No Doubt made a huge impression on the world of music.
B0000028UK|4.0|Hot off of both the commercial and critical success of \\"Ten\\", Pearl Jam returned to the studio to create \\"Five Against One\\", which was soon after renamed to \\"Vs.\\" The success of \\"Ten\\" is obvious, as Pearl Jam adopts a much less pessimistic sound throughout. Yet as a whole, the album is both engaging and intimate, even without the sheer power that the debut carried. You can begin to feel the tremors of Pearl Jam's future growth and maturity.<br />\\"Go\\" kicks off the album, which is appropriate, considering it's title. A fidgety bass line sets the mood early, as this song challenges the listener to bust your hair out, and start banging. While many have made thoroughly deep interpretations of the lyrics, those close to Eddie Vedder say that he admits that it's just about his car. \\"Please! Don't go out on me! Don't go on me! Please Please!\\"<br />\\"Animal\\" follows up in proper form, pulling out another song made just for a stadium filled with messy, sweaty, screaming fans. Some theorize that it's about a gangrape, while others think it's about a newfound hatred for an old flair. Personally, I just know that this song is one of the most adrenaline pumped among Pearl Jam's ammunition.<br />\\"Daughter\\", numero tres, is definately a contender for the best song on the album. Strangely, it's success comes from it's use of accoustic guitars and slightly subdued singing. As is a staple with many Pearl Jam songs, it's about familial trauma. This song allows room for all sides of the music field to express themselves, a brief but memorable solo, a rhythmic tune you'll be humming for weeks, Eddie's singing at it's best, and a great drum beat to boot.<br />\\"Glorified G\\" quickly breaks the atmosphere, returning to rock at it's finest. This song really doesn't take itself too seriously, as Eddie mocks the male mentality of guns = good. Rather than raging and rocking, this song is positively fun. The band is enjoying themselves, and you can't help but enjoy yourself as well.<br />While the next track, \\"Dissident\\", does abandon this sense of fun, it does not return to the patented \\"grunge\\" pissiness that so many people associate with Pearl Jam. Rather, it is an investment of true emotion, yet not at the expense of straight energy. Simultaneously tragic and romantic, Eddie Vedder pities a woman who makes a decision that no one should be forced to.<br />Things get interesting with \\"W.M.A.\\", a song of mild experimentation, hinting at the direction Pearl Jam will take later in their career. A hypnotic rhythm permeates from beginning to end, with Eddie growling and bleeting his way through the six minute masterpiece. (W.M.A. stands for \\"White Male American\\")<br />However, not to disappoint the rock fan, Pearl Jam returns to form with \\"Blood\\", a mildly forgettable 3 minute rocker. It ends with the same hard-rock-riff it started with, and there was little exploration in the between. I have not bothered to really give attention to the lyrics, as I'm not intrigued by the music itself. This is not to say that it is a bad song, but certainly a pale entry, considering it's company.<br />However, Pearl Jam is quick to pick up the ball with the other contender for the best song on the album, \\"Rearview Mirror\\". This song is all about leaving someone who you hate behind. It's tautly paced and delicately structured, slanting from an edgy start to a squealing and screaming climax. 5 minutes of Pearl Jam at their best.<br />\\"Rats\\", while a decent song in it's own right, has the unfortunate fate of playing the same formule of \\"Rearview Mirror\\", while following immediately after it. This serves against it, but it's still definately worth the 4 minutes that Pearl Jam devoted to it. It does have a hint of jazz thrown in to keep your ears perked, so fear not.<br />I would have declared the next entry, \\"Elderly Woman Behind the Counter in a Small Town\\", as being the best on the album and one of PJ's best besides, but it would be a biased opinion. This story of meeting an oldfriend carries a lot of personal importance to me. Do not be deceived by the title, this is a very simple and beautiful song. The title comes from an inside joke of the band's, of their tendency to have single word titles.<br />On \\"Leash\\", Pearl Jam manages to combine very hard rock and an optomistic tone. Demanding that you \\"drop the leash\\", and \\"get out of my ... face\\", Pearl Jam is very obvious about this songs message, they need privacy. However, in spite of this, the song sounds rather happy. This conflict is reminiscent of the dilemma Eddie faced with his own fame in the early nineties: accept his status as a rock star, or swear to hate it?<br />Finishing off the album is \\"Indiffence\\", second only to \\"Release\\" from \\"Ten\\" as Pearl Jam's best closing material. This song shows the quietude and solace that will later become a staple of Pearl Jam's talent. The blinding energy that defines Pearl Jam's hardest songs is bound up in the smallest words that Eddie nearly hums to himself. Truly an example that volume is not the only means of evoking emotion.<br />Definately a great album.
0375703861|5.0|Zadie Smith is clever, amusing, charming, objective and<BR>full of ironic ideas which she transfers, brilliantly, to paper.<BR>I am not going to go into much here, because so many reviewers already did.  Except: I did get a bit tired of the<BR>very cleverness that drove the book, and the ending was slightly disappointing to me, as well...but I did laugh at the last line...just as I'd thought of Archie, yes.  Still, I gave it five<BR>stars for being an amazingly entertaining first novel.  There were times when I compared her to Ann Frank...simply for the sheer genius...
0441172717|2.0|Many readers often incorrectly guess the title as being inspired by the desert regions of Saudi Arabia. While the massive machines of the oil refineries of Arabia and the Northwest are in part, the author was more inclined towards the fragile ecology of the duneform stuctures near Reedsport, Oregon ...Often difficult to suppose the author's real meaning.<br />Interesting book.
0714834491|5.0|It is probably easier to write nebulously about this volume than in very direct and objectively descriptive terms. It's the kind of book that could be said to bring out the poet in you. Maybe because of this, I had a hard time getting a handle on what it was, exactly, before I got a copy. I'd love to try and demystify this wonderful book just a bit.<br />If you have seen the book \\"Everything Reverberates\\" from a few years ago, you have an idea of what this one is like. That book took mostly brief quotes about design and art, and synthesized them into layouts that made the quote a small work of typographic art. Visual puns and kidding visual references to past and present cultures abounded. It was a nice little book to have around and pick up for inspiration or entertainment at the odd down moment.<br />The art of looking sideways takes the earlier book as a starting point and multiplies the sheer volume of content possibly 40 times over. The layout is elegant. There is lots of visual play (pictures, pictograms, sketches, illusions, calligraphy, etc.) and while there may not be quite as much \\"making quotes into small works of typographic art\\", it is still clearly a book given shape by a masterful graphic designer. Whereas the earlier book, because of it's physical dimensions, concentrated on brief quotes, the art of looking sideways is a bit more expansive, including long excerpts from books and articles that have impressed Alan Fletcher, along with pithy quotes (there are plenty of those).<br />So in one sense, this is a book of quotes, and one of the greatest at that. (On the first page proper of the book, Montaigne says, opening the door for the author, \\"I quote others only the better to express myself.\\") But it is more than a book of quotes too. All in all, it is a book worth having around in a prominent place in your home or office, ready to flip open, like a great library dictionary, at any time.
B00005AAFS|5.0|In Mutter, Rammstein breaks away from the almost one-dimensional onslaught of their previous albums to create a powerful, diverse album of exceptional musical quality.<br />The opening track, Mein Herz Brennt, is a ripper. The lyrics speak of demons, ghosts and black faeries creeping through children's bedrooms and is backed up by a powerful melody that just blows you away once it gets into full swing.<br />Almost every track on the album from here on features something that makes it memorable. Just a little change in pace here, a little change in melody there, some powerful chorus sections on most and you soon find this album growing on you every time you listen to it. <br />Tracks like Links 234, Feuer Frei and Rein Raus will satisfy fans of Rammstein's pacy metal style used in their previous albums, while Sonne, Zwitter, Ich Will and the foot-stomping head-banging delight that is Adios oozes with a classy assembly and finish that are often lacking in this genre of music. <br />Rammstein also shows a gentler side with the tracks Mutter and Nebel, slower paced but no less brilliant. <br />For me the best song on the album has to be Spieluhr though. Superb, yet eerie lyrics talk about a child being buried alive by accident with a music box in his/her hands. The chorus is fantastic, just about the catchiest thing I've heard in any form of music in a long time, and the whole song is just brilliantly put together like all the other tracks on this album. <br />To summarize: <br />Best tracks: Mein Herz Brennt, Sonne, Spieluhr, Adios<br />Worst track: Rein Raus, if you have to push me for one<br />Mutter as an album delivers an incredible musical experience and every song deserves its place on the album - no fillers here. The deep, thundering sound demands a pair of decent speakers - turn up the volume and prepare to hear the windows rattle.<br />Rammstein is a band on the rise, that's for sure. The mere fact that they broke away from their one dimensional metalish soundon the previous two albums and ventured into a smarter, more orchestral and melodic, yet still pleasurably hard and heavy sound (yep, the parents will definitely worry about you if they find you listening to this lot in a dark room!) for Mutter shows us that this is a band with massive potential. I can't wait to hear their next effort - hopefully they stick to German. Rammstein in English just won't be the same.<br />Check out [URL] for English translations of the German lyrics.
B00005R2M3|5.0|Shakira's Laundry Service is absolutely amazing! Excellent! Her first English album has a perfect blend of Latin Rhytms, Rock and also some Eastern inlfuences also. All of the songs are excellent, especially Tango, Rules, Whenever Wherever, Fool... If youlike any of Shakira's older material, then this is a MUST for you, and I also recommend it to everyone who likes just a little of this type of music!
B00000K19E|2.0|I thought this movie would be alot better! Especially after readin all the reviews!! Acting wise, strong acting, I can give it that! Plot wise, it was terrible! This movie wasn't that great, even though it was better than some movies that I've seen, it beat my expectations, cause I don't expect anything from a movie, so my expectations are set very low, 1 star! The Matrix was better then one star! The special effects were good, but that doesn't make the movie, when will people learn that? That's all I have to say!
B00005YW4H|5.0|Absolutely amazing voice, great songs - it has been a while since I have found an album that is this entertaining, relaxing, sexy all in one. Every song is great, I haven't taken in off the CD player in the house or the car in a month. It is interesting that she could be singing about a man or a woman. I know this will not be defined as \\"just a chick CD\\". At times she reminds me of Billie Holliday, and at other times I hear a little of Ricky Lee Jones, but than she will suddenly add a little piece that is compeltely her own - so fun to listen too. Can't wait for the next Album and a NW tour.
B00003CXTG|1.0|A movie for 12-year-old girls. There's nothing wrong with that, provided you are a 12-year-old girl. But if you aren't, beware that the love story is improbable, if not ludicrous. And this thing is LONG with a capital L-O-N-G. Why they felt the need to include Dolittle's raid is beyond me. I guess so it didn't end on a downer. We know who won the war, you don't have to put it in the freakin' movie.<br />Still, great action scenes. Too bad it is physically painful to watch up until that point. Again, if you are a 13-year-old girl, by all means watch it, you will love it. If not, borrow a friend's DVD and just watch the action scenes.
B000002NJS|5.0|Ray of Light's excellence is hard to describe in words, it's so AMAZING. But let's start with the fact that this album is defenitely Madonna's critically most succesful album, and also VERY succesful commercially (almost 15 million copies sold). The greateness of this album is based simply on the fact that it combines Madonna's dance pop style (Patrick Leonard) succesfully with electronica (William Orbit), eastern rhytms and spiritual lyrics. Every song has meaningful and &quot;deep&quot; lyrics. In addition to the smash hits Frozen, Ray Of Light and The Poer of Goodbye, the albums includes many other masterpieces such as Drowned World/Substitute For Love, Candy Perfume Girl, Swim, Sky Fits Heaven, Little Star (dedicated to Madonna's first child, Lourdes)... In fact every song on this album is a masterpiece! This is a MUST for every Madonna fan, and VERY highly recommended also to others. This really is a CLASSIC MASTERPIECE OF THE 90's!
0385503954|5.0|I can't add much more to what all the reviews below have already said - approach the book in a pristine state, don't want to give away any story developments, separate sections all well written in different styles.  It's a hell of a book, with a terrific heartache at the end.  That said, what impressed me most was how believably McEwan describes Briony's juvenile state of mind - every whim, every extraordinary turn of thought rendered so plausibly.  And in the final revelation (although some of the book's surprises can be guessed at, the last is the best, and truly impressive), he reminds us of how juvenile we all, and not only Briony, remain as fiction lovers, however sophisticated we claim to have become: we want our heroes to be handsome, our maidens beautiful and tragic, and we need them to sail away happily together into the sunset.  And that is what great fiction, and McEwan, does for us.
B00005NWM3|5.0|Nickelback has made a straight ahead rock album with melody. Its got great sound and some well thought out lyrics. Is it groundbreaking? No. However it does beat the ... out of most of the drivel that is heard on rock radio(...). Rock and Roll is supposed to be fun people was Aerosmith not influenced by the Rolling Stones and the Beatles by Elvis Presley. You can hear there influences but so what the secret is to know what you're good at and these guys are good at foot tapping beat on your steering wheel rock. My advice is if you like melody with a hard edge this is the album for you.
B00005JKCF|5.0|I have to say that after going to see spider-man i really don't see how episode 2 can top it as the summer's best film. This film had everything i look for in a movie granted i am probably not the best film critic around but i look for the simple things in a movie and this delivered well above my expectations. i want a movie that has good special effect's but not overdone one that actually has a good story or one in spidermans case that sticks to the story of the comic book as close as possible and spiderman does this quite well. And if your a big spider-man fan i don't think you will be disapointed at all with this film. As for actors and actresses WOW nice to see hollywood put it's trust in a differen't group of actors than you would normally see for a film of this nature and does it deliver. Toby Maguire is an excellent spider-man and one i think kids who will watch this film can relate to. He does an outstanding job as peter parker and spider-man. Kirsten Dunst who said this lady could not be Mary Jane she sizzled I for one thought she did an outstanding job as spider-man's love intrest. And who can forget the green goblin played by Willem Dafoe i must say they have the perfect cast for this picture. I want to also add that Sam Raimi is the director for this picture i had actually never heard of him before this picture but i really do feel after seeing this film you will be hearing alot about this man what a director WOW. Hey sam please don't change any of the cast for part 2 the talent here is fantastic. This film is definately a must see 5 stars easy as for episode II we will see if it can compare with the nice suprises of spider-man.
B00003CXI0|4.0|I was real reluctant to go see this movie. My husband sort of made me but in the end I was really suprised and glad that I seen it. It was a harmless adventuress kind of movie. I have heard many things about this film. It was said that this movie is filled with witchcraft and it is true that magic and witches are in this film, but nothing too suggestive or eerie. My son is 7months but I think he may enjoy this film when he turn 3 or so. Its cute and Harry Potter is a cutie too. One Love
6301773551|5.0|This is the episode that started it all. Obi-Wan, Luke, C3p0, R2D2, Chewbacca, Princess Leia, and Darth Vader.
B00005O5JV|5.0|That was a fumnny movie and it was good movie.
B000002B5L|5.0|The fugees (w Lauryn Hill) bursted on the scene with this album. Killing me softly with his song, Ready or Not and Fu gee la are the tracks that make this a all star album. Buy It!
B000000W5L|5.0|The best rock album of all-time.  Exile contains some of the most amazing rock songs I have ever heard, and certainly establishes a &quot;Rolling Stones&quot; style of music, if wasn't already acknowledged.  In my opinion, Exile stands above Let it Bleed as the best Stones album.  <BR>There is no letdown in this album, but there are some unbelivable high-points.  &quot;Rocks Off&quot;, &quot;Tumbling Dice&quot;, &quot;Sweet Virginia&quot;, &quot;Let it Loose&quot;, and &quot;Stop Breaking Down&quot; all rank among my top favorite rock songs ever.  <BR>Do not pass this album by.
B00000ADG2|5.0|Lauryn hit solid gold with this album. The choice cuts are Doo Wop, everything is everything and lost ones. This deserves every grammy given to it.
0441172717|4.0|I'd like to get inside Frank Herbert's brain and find out what planet he came from.  You just aren't a normal person if you can create entire worlds (and a universe) and make an epic saga out of it.<br />Although the story behind Dune has distinctive political/economic flair to it (centered around the spice and spice mining), it's so much more than that.  The inclusion of the Fremen prophecy regarding the coming of the \\"One\\" (a.k.a., Quisatz Haderach; hope I  spelled it right) the mental capabilities of the Bene Gesserit Sisterhood and the Machine building Tleilaxu cilvilization bring entirely new depth to this enigmatic futuristic world.  The story is quite complex and the reader should vigilantly read to grasp all the details.  (I'm not going to give away the story, just read the book).
B00000B9BD|4.0|Every Strawbs album between Witchwood and Nomadness has something unique to offer.  Put it all together, its the same band but the progression of band member changes and sound were so quick and impressive that for the most part no two albums are all that similar. Grave New World is the Strawbs pioneering the sound to its farthest reaches. This was a really great band and Dave Cousins is a fantastic talent who deserves more attention for passionate songs and original ideas. I only found out about his band by chance, but I feel that their music had a great joy and sincerity about it, and this album is the cornerstone at which all their ideas reached it's zenith.
B000062XFG|4.0|There were moments during the second season when Star Trek: The Next Generation was as good as it ever got, and a few moments when it was worse than it ever was before or after.<br />Three standout episodes elevate this season, any one of them on par with the best episode of the next two years.<br />The first was \\"Matter of Honor.\\"  Cmdr. Riker is assigned to serve as an exchange officer on a Klingon ship.  The dynamics of Riker with the ship's crew elevate this episode well above the rest.  Only a cheesy Wesley-centric subplot spoils the fun.<br />The second is \\"Measure of a Man,\\" the one episode where the series hit one out of the park in the first two years.  Cmdr. Data's legal status is in question: Sentient being or toaster, to be disassembled at Starfleet's whim.  Hits some pretty heavy subjects without preaching or taking the easy way out.  This also introduced the poker game that ran through the rest of the series.<br />The third standout is \\"Q Who.\\"  The pesky god-like entity Q re-appears, asking to join the Enterprise crew.  They need him, he claims.  Rejected, he attempts to prove his worth by flinging the 1701-D into a far corner of the galaxy and an encounter with the Borg, a nasty and implacable enemy.  Exciting and dark, this was great Star Trek of any generation.  Unfortunately, this was the swan song for Q as a sinister presence.  After this episode, he's not much more than a mildly annoying comic foil for Picard.<br />The low points for season two are \\"The Child\\" and \\"Shades of Gray\\".  The season opener \\"The Child\\" was a desperate attempt to cope with a writers' strike by dusting off a script from the aborted mid-seventies revival of Star Trek with the original cast.  The shotgun marriage of generations is dull, plodding and ridiculous.<br />\\"Shade of Gray\\" finished out the second season in even weaker fashion.  Little more than a clip show hung around a weak premise about Riker nearly getting killed by an alien plant and needing his memories \\"stimulated\\" to save his life, this was another casuality of the 1988 WGA strike.<br />There were a few more episodes that make the second season worthwhile.  \\"Elementary, Dear Data\\" is probably the best of the \\"Holodeck malfunction\\" episodes that would later become one Star Trek's most annoying cliches.<br />\\"Up The Long Ladder\\" is a mostly light comic episode that also deals intelligently with the serious issues of abortion and cloning.<br />\\"The Emissary\\" introduced fan-favorite Keylahr (sp), Work's ex-girlfriend.  A good episode by itself, it would be followed up two years later by one of the fourth season's best.  Unfortunately, it also led to the introduction of Alexander, Worf's son and one of the least necessary characters in Star Trek history.<br />The extras are well done, mostly new interviews with Rick Berman and old interviews with some of the cast and crew, including the late Gene Roddenberry.  One thing that kind of hit me was the fact that the new Berman interview was tape less than a week before 9/11.  How I envy that man on my TV right now because he's still living in the world that existed before that day.<br />The only quibble I have is the price.  This set is one less disk than the others in the series but it's the same price.  Far be it for Paramount to be fair with its DVD pricing.
B000001FA4|4.0|A quality record by virtue of a scattering of classic tracks that highlight U2's unique ability to blend the atmospherics of their War-style art rock with irrestible pop catchiness. The result is at least five superb songs mixed with a collection of ludicrous filler material, including the &quot;strange sounds&quot; of 4th of July and the bizarre Elvis Presley...(Maybe I just don't get it...) Excellent, even though you might have to habitually skip a few numbers.
B00003CXBK|4.0|Princess Mononoke is one of those Animes that most people would enjoy, and with good reason.  There is an excellent story, fluid animation, good voice acting (most of the titme) and a little bit of everything to keep people happy.  However it is not perfect.<br />The story itself revolves around Ashika who after his village is attacked by a demon he is thrown out and forced to find a cure for his curse.  After escaping from an army of Samurais he arrives in Irontown, where they make guns and use iron as a source for everything.  Irontown is constantly under attack by Princess Mononke who represents the wolf tribe.  Eventually soem hunters show up representing the emporor who wants the head of the Forest Spririt so he can achieve Immortality.  From there we have many more battles and a kick [bootie] ending.<br />However there are a few problems.  For one thing the voice acting, despite being good, seemed to fluctuate at times from good, to ok, and sometimes pretty poor.  Also the story itself will turn of the average viewer or how it ends (kind of like Final Fantasy Spirits Within).  other than those two things though this is overall a very good movie.
B00005JKCH|5.0|SPIDER-MAN rocks! It has something for everyone in the family: some action, cool effects, a little romance, and even a couple of moral messages. Most people are at least familiar with the origins of Spider-man and since that's a large part of the movie's plot, it isn't worth discussing here. The movie stays fairly true to those origins. Granted a few minor adjustments have been made to make the movie flow better in it's modern setting, but those differences aren't worth quibbling.<br /><br />There are only a two flaws I could see with the movie. To begin with, the action sequences weren't long enough especially the climatic battle at the end. The movie would have flowed a little faster with some more action. The other flaw is that Tobey Maguire and Kristen Dunst just didn't have any chemistry between them. It appears as though their characters were acting like they were attracted to each other instead of appearing as though their characters were in love.<br /><br />Sam Raimi has been a Spider-man fan for years and his passion for the comics is what lead to his being hired to direct SPIDER-MAN. He hasn't let anyone down. Other than ARMY OF DARKNESS, SPIDER-MAN is probably his best movie yet.<br /><br />The acting is extraordinary for a comic book movie and Tobey Maguire is right on the money as Peter Parker. Kristen Dunst is a great Mary Jane Watson, except when she and Maguire share romantic scenes. I was also impressed by the actor who played Harry Osborne, his portrayal was superb.<br /><br />Overall a great movie that the entire family will probably enjoy. There isn't any sex, only one bad word, and the violence is almost cartoony so I really don't know why this is PG-13 instead of PG. The MPAA really screwed up with the rating of this one.
B00002MZ12|5.0|Alanis sounds much better unplugged. I'd never been a fan until I heard this production. It is great to hear her voice and to even understand her lyrics rather than bury them both with overproduced studio work or to hear her in huge stadium venues. The last three cuts, &quot;King of pain&quot;, &quot;You oughta know&quot;, and &quot;Uninvited&quot; earn constant replay on my car CD player.
B00005U11Z|2.0|I have been following Journey since their inception as a prog-rock/Jazz fusion band in the early 70s, through their rise to superstardom in the 80s. I was very excited, then ultimately let down by their recent &quot;comeback&quot;. The new singer Steve Augeri is a 2nd rate Steve Perry clone. In an effort to cash in on past glories, Journey has taken the easy path by recruiting an almost exact replica to replace Perry. Had they found a new singer with a distinctive voice to expore new territory, this might have been a more interesting reincarnation of a once great band. Augeri's limitations become startlingly clear with the blatant use of prerecorded vocals used to augment his limited ability to mimic Perry's sound. The musical performances are lackluster and the true genius of this band, Neal Schon, is never given an opportunity to shine that he deserves. Very dissapointing to this fan of 25+ years.
0786867973|5.0|Upon baking about 5 things for my daughter's birthday party last year, it was like a best friend taking you by the hand and making the journey so delicious and so simple.  Her brownies are so simple and out of this world.  The taffy apple recipe is also the best.  The only problem I had was figuring out what all the different sugars were....Upon asking some british friends, I realized it was basically white and brown sugar!
B00005QCYC|4.0|Obviously, the first film was great and everyone enjoyed it. The Lost World was okay, but didn't compare to the first. Finally the third, which I believe ruined the entire franchise. Thankfully enough, there is a new bonus disc that is only available in this boxed set with a few more features for the three films that did not make it onto the film's disc. <br />I was somewhat disappointed the Jurassic Park was not a 2-disc set. Instead it advertises that there is 60 minutes of bonus footage on both the first and second installments. Fortunately it is more than that. The Jurassic Park III trailer on the first 2 discs is horrible, revealing nothing, it only shows trees and a narration. I was also mad that there are no commentaries by Steven Spielberg, now that would have been interesting. JP3 is loaded with features, more than the first two flicks, most of it is pretty interesting nonetheless. <br />I would say that this set is still worth it in the longrun mainly because of the bonus disc, and being a fan of supplemental material myself, this was perfect for me.
0767802659|3.0|This is one of those films that as long as you're not looking for much of a plot, you'll do fine. I really liked the idea behind it, though. It was interesting to see the director's version of a future fascist state. The look of the bugs is kinda cheesy, though. And I think the dialogue is scarier than the bugs ever were.<BR>Still, it works pretty good as a popcorn DVD movie that doesn't require a lot of thought.
B00005OAA6|5.0|I always was a big fan of Victoria, I bought the Spice Girls records only because of her and Geri. I waited such a long time<BR>for Posh's solo-Album and when it was released, I was happy like a little child as I got it. It's much more better than all other<BR>Spice Girls solo records and it's just as good as \\"Schizophonic\\"<BR>by Geri Halliwell. Especially I liked \\"Not such an innocent girl\\" and \\"Unconditional Love\\" but the other songs are very very good to. It's only a puty that it never walked onto the German or American Album Charts and that it has only got #10 in UK for one week. But that's the destiny of the best I think. When you get it, you can't take it out of your CD-Player again.
B00003CXBK|5.0|PM is one of Hayao Miyazaki's best films. I am a real big fan of his works. PM has beautiful animation, pre-rendered backgrounds and characters. To add to that, both the Eng. and JP voice acting are excellent. PM is a MUST for every anime fan.
B000007RV5|5.0|This was a good cd I loved every song, but I wish Limp Bizkit didn't cuss.Every time I go to the store I have to buy Limp Bizkit(edited).Isn't Limp Bizkit a Christian? So I hope the next time I go to the store I won't have to buy Limp Bizkit(edited).<br />               So guys lay off the cussin.
B00005QG9J|5.0|Since I heard the first release off this album, I had to have it. I have not been disappointed! I love the whole thing, which is something I couldn't have said about the first few albums. I liked Make Yourself, but I LOVE Morning View! I'm hooked now!
B0000640VO|4.0|Though redundant in some aspects (many times throughout a point is driven home repeatedly), this movie is a great way to spend a rainy sunday afternoon.  Typical love story with some new twists.  In a word, cute.
B00005OAIE|5.0|The 1st time I heard &quot;No such Thing&quot; on the radio my ears perked up right away.  After listening to my heavier, darker, more complicated music... this CD has become a nice reprieve and one of my favorites.  It is soothing. I tap my toes and it lifts my spirits. I don't have to work hard to listen to it. It keeps me interested every time.  For those of you who need something fresh that doesn't drag you down, that is up beat, that you can play anywhere and with anyone - I encourage you to buy this.  It's perfect in the morning, lovely at sunset, and wonderful in the car driving. This will be a favorite of mine for quite some time!  I love every bit of this CD.  This kid is terrific.  I'm thrilled that his spirit is captured in music.  As he grows up, his music will change and grow with him.... but for now - Bravo, he is precious and so is his first CD!
B00003CXFG|1.0|Please, if you loved this movie, have your head examined.
B00000E0YH|4.0|I concur with everyone else's comments; this is simply an amazing prog metal album. I would have given five stars, but I am knocking off one star because this CD is missing a song called &quot;Dream Dancer&quot; which was available on the cassette version (alas, my own copy of the cassette has long since become unplayable). As good as all the other tunes are, that song was probably my favorite, and I'm disappointed that it was not included on the CD. If the powers that be are reading this - PLEASE re-release this album with that song!
B000000I0H|5.0|I have been an Oldfield fan since day one, I remember buying Tubular Bells back in the early seventies for my father and thinking what was going on here, I played it again straight away and was hooked. I have almost everything he has ever recorded, I have seen him in concert three times.<BR>I would recommend this album as one of his best along with Songs Of Distant Earth and Tubular Bells Three, I am lucky enough to have a job that allows me to listen to music all day and all I listen to is Mike Oldfield
B000063DIR|1.0|I am a great, huge, enormous fan of Ozzy Osbourne. I think Diary of a madman is his best album. However, I can't imagine why one would like to DESTROY a masterpiece like this re-recording the whole bass and drums tracks. Trujillo is a fine bass player, but his playing comes NOWHERE NEAR that of mr. Bob Daisley. Five stars to the original, 0 to this &quot;musical Frankenstein&quot;.
B0000630BT|5.0|I am a metal fan,and I listen to the all metal generes,from heavy to black metal.And I bought this cd just 2 months ago,and after listening to it a few times,and after reading a lot of metal magazines I realised that this is a BEST METAL CD OF ALL TIMES.<BR>I recomanded it to everyone who listen metal music.Everywhone who didn't listened &quot;Painkiller&quot; could not tell what is the best metal cd ever !
B0000636UN|4.0|I've always been a huge fan of Sheryl Crow; her music is honest and entertaining.  Her songwriting talent is also top-notch.  C'MON, C'MON represents everything that is good about Crow.  The music on this album is incredible from start to finish, and Crow's lyrics are personal and touching.  This is one of those CDs you can listen to without interruption, and is full of potential radio hits.  Crow also highlights some really cool musical influences.  Lenny Kravitz, Liz Phair, Don Henley, Natalie Maines, and Emmylou Harris all lend their vocal talents on the album.  Crow's voice blends beautifully with those of her collaborators.  One thing disappoints me... I really enjoyed Sheryl's work on Stevie Nicks' 2001 release, TROUBLE IN SHANGRI-LA.  Nicks, who is one of the most talented female singer/songwriters out there, lends her background vocals to &quot;Diamond Road&quot; and &quot;C'Mon, C'Mon.&quot;  The problem is you can hardly hear her.  Nicks has a distinctive voice, one that blends beautifully with Crow's.  My other disappointment was the choice not to include &quot;You're Not The One,&quot; a track on which Nicks is more vocally prominent.  Fortunately it's on the import single for &quot;Soak Up The Sun.&quot;  All in all, this record is awesome, proving Sheryl will rock for a long time.
B0000630BT|5.0|I bought this cd just 2 months ago,and after listening to it several    <BR>times,and after reading a lot of metal magazines I relised that this is the BEST METAL CD for all times.I listen to all metal generes(from heavy to black metal),and I am just disapointed that didn't bought this cd before,because is a MASTERPICE of metal music.I recomanded it to everyone who listen metal music.And people who didn't listened &quot;Painkiller&quot; ,can't say what metal music is !
B00005R2M3|5.0|I admit, I wasn't sure what to expect from Shakira besides &quot;Whenever, Wherever&quot; - which I loved.  Since I got this CD, I've had trouble taking out of the CD player.  There's a variety of music that displays the talent of Shakira.  It's a great CD - you won't be disappointed.
B000001GQB|4.0|This set by Bohm is OK, and the price in particular I can appreciate, but I don't really<BR>understand the very glowing reviews. The reviews were a big reason I went for this set -<BR>outside of the price. My only other reference is Tate and the English Chamber Orchestra<BR>40, 41, and there is absolutely no comparison to the Bohm 40, 41. Tate completely blows<BR>Bohm away. To me Bohm is nothing but strings with a little percussion. It couldn't just<BR>be my sound system because it's with this same system that I listen to Tate. So, go for<BR>Bohm for the price and it you mostly enjoy Mozart's string arrangements. I wished I had<BR>tried Karajan.
B00005Y228|5.0|Kylie's time has arrived!  I am listening to this album right now!  What a cool album!  I've been following Kylie's career ever since she broke out with the remake \\"Locomotion.\\"  She's come a long way since then and seeing her grow and modify her style has been something of a breath of fresh air in comparison to many American teen pop wannabes who don't have near the talent Kylie commands!  Every song has a unique spirit to it instead of every song being a retread of each other over and over.  The time has come for Kylie to take over the charts and really show how those girls down under really party!!  Kylie has arrived!  \\"Fever,\\" is going to be this summers hottest single!!  Mark my words!!
B00005QGAT|5.0|In my honest opinion, Off the Wall is the best Michael Jackson album.  When I recently bought the Off the Wall Special Edition CD, I was blown away.  I fell in love with this album all over again.  I had the cassette tape of this album when I was a kid, so when I listened to it again for the first time in a very long time, it sounded better the second time around.  I knew this Special Edition CD was special when I pulled out the CD from its sleeve, and saw two rare, gorgeous pictures of a very young Michael Jackson posing in his then-trademark tuxedo in front of the brick wall.  It reminded me of just how good looking Michael was when he was only twenty-one years old, before all the work he had done on his nose and his face.  It made me wish he had frozen in time at about the release of this album.  I then wished that after listening to such classic songs as &quot;Don't Stop 'Til You Get Enough,&quot; &quot;Rock With You,&quot; &quot;I Can't Help It,&quot; &quot;Off the Wall,&quot; and &quot;She's Out of My Life,&quot; that he sang with the same amount of enthusiasm on the albums after Off the Wall.  It was pure bliss listening to this album again.  Even though it was orignally released in August of 1979, it stands up to the test of time, and doesn't sound totally dated.  I definitely reccomend this album to anyone who is a fan of Michael's or not.  Put aside any reservations you have about Michael Jackson, and get this CD.  You won't be disappointed.  I guarentee it.
0783241569|3.0|This is a great comedy vehicle for Hugh Grant -- sardonic wit etc. Julia Roberts is acceptable because the role (essentially she plays herself) is not too taxing on her very limited acting ability. The supporting cast is quite funny -- especially the flat-mate. The finale with Elvis Costello attempting to sing like a grizzled Charles Aznavor is hilariously kitschy. Overall a surprisingly entertaining movie in spite of Julia Roberts.
B00005YXZH|5.0|They are always moving in a different direction, and expanding their sound. If you want more alt-country, put in being there or mermaid avenue albums. If you want more experimentation, YHF is where you need to be. Don't listen to this album if you are sad, and listen to this album when you are sad. I like how the drums are a beat behind everyone else in the first track. THEY ROK!!!!!!!!
6304057709|5.0|Sense and Sensibility is a film to watch while cuddled up with a blanket, hot chocolate, and a blazing fire.  It is an opulent feast for the eyes and heart.  The story concerns the romantic ups and downs of the Dashwood sisters, practical Elinor (Emma Thompson) and overly-emotional Marianne (Kate Winslet), and the men in their lives, flawed Edward (Hugh Grant)and middle-aged lovelorn Colonel Brandon (Alan Rickman).      Alan Rickman will melt your heart as the tender and shy Colonel, and Emma Thompson is not just the lovely leading lady; she is also the Oscar-winning screenwriter.  The English countryside never looked lovelier, and the costumes, sets, and script are superb.  A step back to a gentler time, this is a look at the restrictive manners and conventions that ruled one's life so severely, and how the young ladies persevere to find the men of their dreams.  If you like period romances, you'll enjoy Sense and Sensibility.
B000059HB7|4.0|Director Howard Hawks and actor John Wayne must have thought the story effective, for they essentially remade RIO BRAVO twice more, first as EL DORADO in 1967 and then as RIO LOBO in 1970.  In this particular version, Dean Martin is a run-down sheriff who has lost all self-respect and is busy drinking his way to the bottom of the barrell--but old friend John Wayne drifts into town and soon sets about whipping him into shape.  With old-timer Walter Brennan and youngster Ricky Nelson at their sides, and with a little support from Angie Dickinson, they clean up the town.<br />As the first of the three versions, RIO BRAVO generally receives the most approval--but although enjoyable, I have always felt it compares unfavorably with EL DORADO.  Both films have a relaxed tone, neatly mixing the western-style action with healthy doses of enjoyable comedy, but of the two RIO BRAVO seems much looser in both script and execution and somewhat less well cast.  Then pop-star Ricky Nelson is cast in an effort to appeal to teenagers, and believe it or not the film comes to a grinding halt that he might perform the obligatory song; in the meantime, the usually expert Angie Dickinson is broadsided by some of the worst dialogue this side of the Pecos.<br />Even so, Wayne and Martin play very well and have considerable chemistry--certainly more than enough to hold your interest right through to the end--and although the film sometimes feels slow, when the action kicks in it kicks in hard and with plenty of excitement.  Reccommended, but give EL DORADO a try.
0671027344|4.0|I just read this book myself. I was so captivated by the story that I ended up reading the whole thing in the span of a day.  Some people call it a coming of age story like Catcher in the Rye Well, with in that spirit, maybe. I can't compare this book to Catcher which is one of my Favorite books. Granted, I do think this book has the more thoughtout ending. I give it four stars because, some of the things come at you so fast, without any real preparation for them. I found that some of the issues this book deals with to be a bit vivid and on the money. He just throws them out there without a  heads up. Outside of that, it's still a great book.
0792110188|5.0|Director Howard Hawks and John Wayne would essentially remake the same story three times: first as RIO BRAVO in 1959, then as EL DORADO in 1967, and finally as RIO LOBO in 1970.  Caught between the popularity of the first and the dismal failure of the third, EL DORADO is something of a neglected film--but for my money, it is easily the best of the three.<br /><br />The story is the stuff that Western myths are made of.  Aging gun-slinger John Wayne is offered a job as hired gun in a range war, but he discovers that acceptance of the job would place him on the wrong side of the law--which in this case is old friend and small town sheriff Robert Mitchum, who has made himself a laughing stock by drinking his way to the bottom of every bottle he can find.  Wayne accordingly drifts into town, whips Mitchum into shape, and with the assistance of crotchety deputy Arthur Hunnicutt and youngster James Caan they set about cleaning up the town.<br /><br />Although EL DORADO has a leisurely tone, but it never feels in the least slow--largely due to an unexpectedly witty script that crackles with memorable dialogue (at one point when Mitchum asks Wayne what he's looking at, Wayne responds \\"A tin star with a drunk pinned to it\\") and unexpected situations (such as Caan's unfortunate way with a shotgun.)  The entire cast handles both humor and old-west action with equal skill, and both Wayne and Mitchum offer some the best work of their impressive careers here; James Caan (in his first major success), Arthur Hunnicutt, Charlene Holt, and  Michele Carey are equally memorable.<br /><br />There are a great many westerns more critically acclaimed than EL DORADO--RED RIVER, THE SEARCHERS, and STAGE COACH to name but a few.  And I enjoy them.  But EL DORADO is like meeting an old friend whose company you always enjoy.  Strongly recommended.<br /><br />GFT, Amazon Reviewer
B00003CX5P|5.0|Well I will just say this greatest DVD of all time.  The pictures in this movie is awesome.  The greatest part of this DVD is that they have so many special features in this DVD compared to the video it is so awesome.  They have the 12 part web documentary that goes throught the making of this film.  They have the 5 part thing with all sorts of stuff like the two main characters Darth Maul and Obi Wan Kanobi going through the fight scenes and all sorts of things.  Other than that this DVD is great the movie is awesome with Yoda and Jar Jar stealing the show they had a I had a great time seeing this in the theaters and i also have a great time seeing this on the DVD player because of the awesome picture and the greatest sounds I have been hearing from the THX surround sound.<br />I will be going this upcoming week to see the newest installment of the STAR WARS Trilogy Episode Two Attack Of The Clones i know this is about the clone wars but I have a feeling at the end the movie is going to take a twist of fate with the story of Queen Amidela and Ankikin because i was watching the last one and I saw that Ani had sometype of crush on Amidela and that i have been figuring out the plot to this one that Ani and the Queen will get married at the end of this episode and in Three that they will have their two children Luke and Leia which will then end the relationship between Luke and Kanobi and that is when Ani will take a turn for the worst and start his transformation to Darth Vader.

B000056K04|1.0|This album is the sort of thing you would put in a bag, and light it on fire in front of someone that you didnt like's yard.
B00005YXZH|5.0|The negative reviews crack me up, only because I have been there.  Most of them come from alt-country fans (read: narrow minded, I can say this because I used to be one of those fans) who refuse to acknowledge anything as music which isn't derivative of the Carter Family.  <br />Not paying attention to these detractors Wilco have produced an album that draws upon the whole of music (save jazz, sadly, but maybe next time).  They transcend genre or timeframe, aligning Melloncamplike arraingments next to the drones and blips of post-rock, all the while creating something wholly original.  This should have been a cause for celebration amoung both Reprise and its long-time fans.  The fact that it wasn't is just sad.  It means that people have stopped growing and listening.  It is similar to the reaction of such artists as Miles Davis and Coltrane when they went off to explore more sonically challenging territories to the dismay of some of their followers.  The fact is those recordings went on to become legendary, just as YHF will.<br />I, like many of the reviewers here, have had this album for some time, but unlike a few of them, I loved it on the first listen and immediately thought it was their best to date.  But I think that reaction was possible due to what I have been listening to for some time, which were bands like Radiohead, Mogwai, Godspeed, Do Make Say Think, etc. as well as the jazz of Mingus, Coltrane, Davis, etc.  I say this because I think Wilco's future lies in the hands of fans of these more exploratory musicians, rather than in the backward looking minds of the fans of Johnny Cash and Ralph Stanley (not that there is anything wrong with either).  This is a progressive album in the way that music should be progressive.  It is Brian Wilson teamed with Thom Yorke or Tweedy of old teamed with Tweedy of Summerteeth.  In short, it is a combination of elements both old and new that produces something extraordinary.  Buy it if you love intelligent music, or really love music that transcends genre and special interests, and is willing to find its own voice rather than play to the crowd.
0375751513|2.0|For me, The Picture of Dorian Gray was a tedious read.  I did not particularly enjoy it that much, although I acknowledge that it is a good piece of literature.  It is very well written and full of details and vivid descriptions.  The story is told artfully and exquisitely but I found it long-winded and difficult to get through at times.  Many people would enjoy a book like this, but it was not for me.  I couldn't relate to the British aristocracy system and was utterly appalled at how unbelievably shallow the characters were, although Wilde was probably going for that effect.  I was also disappointed with the ending.  I thought the point of the novel would be to eliminate the stereotype that bad people are ugly, but it just perpetuated it.  I would recommend this book to anyone who likes a book that makes them think.  It is also recommended to people who like books from this era (late 1800's) and have a lot of time on their hands.
0385503954|3.0|I really would like to give this book 5 stars because most of it is brilliant. An incredible love story, an incredible war story, an amazing tale, perhaps, of the evil that we can all do even when we don't really intend to. Unfortunately, in part 4, the last 18 pages of the book, the snake of postmodernism slithers in and poisons the entire corpus.<br />Like other people here who have (wisely) refrained from going into the details of the plot, I won't explain what happens at the end; at least, not explicitly. But let me put it this way:<BR>remember when you first saw a film or TV show in which it was<BR>revealed that all that had happened was \\"just a dream.\\" You thought: hey, that was pretty cool. And then, after you saw that same stupid plot device over and over, you wanted to chuck your TV out the window?<br />You'll definitely want to hurl the book across the room when you come to the end of Atonement, where McEwan doesn't trust himself to have a conventional ending. Or maybe he didn't want to have a happy ending (fine with me, by the way). Or here's another theory: Julian Barnes snuck into McEwan's study and replaced the real ending with his own twisted version! Ah ha, now we're on to something.<br />It's really a pity because in addition to a lot of beautiful writing and a great story, there's plenty to chew on in the first three (much longer) sections about the nature of fiction, its relationship to truth, and about fictional form, too. The final part cheapens all that has led up to it. For the 5-star version of this novel, read sections one through three and then resist (resist!) the strong pull you will feel to peak ahead. Unless you are a grad student who puts postmodern games ahead of, ahem, the truth of fiction, you'll thank me.
B00002SSKI|5.0|The movie &quot;Now &amp; then&quot; is about a group of 4 girls who grew up together in the city of Shelby, Indiana. Their names are Roberta, Chrissy, Sam, and Teeny.

B00005UEAR|5.0|One thing that people seem to be doing is comparing their new work to their old work. It would be very wrong to do such a thing given that we're now listening to a very different Dream Theater to what we've heard in the past.<br />Rather than compare, let's relish in another face that Dream Theater have shown us in this album. This particular one is probably their heaviest contribution and all band members have shown some serious development in their playing abilities.<br />Overall, I can't stop playing both CD's consecutively and have been doing so for almost 80 times now (be it in the car, at home or at the office). That probably explains why I've learned the drum parts so well!<br />But the fact is, I absolutely LOVE it. Whether it's their best work or not, can't say for sure as everything they've done is great in my books. Personally, I consider their entire works as one album and it's been a hell of a ride so far.<br />But then again, a true Dream Theater fan doesn't need to read all this as such people would've bought the album long before any reviews. As for those of you who are new to Dream Theater's sound, if you love your fair share of heavy metal virtuosity, this is one album that should NOT be surpassed. In fact, it's even heavier and tastier than what that...band Metallica can come up with these days!
B00005JKED|1.0|Even Denzel, a fine actor, after recieving his academy award said this film was &quot;..not his best work&quot; Definitely one for the 18 to 24 year old market because I certainly didn't like it.
B000002UB6|5.0|&quot;Let It Be&quot; was an amazing album! Every song on this album is a masterpiece. My favorite song on this album is &quot;Across the Universe.&quot; John's lyrics are so melodic and breezy. I close my eyes and get lost in my own beatle-istic world. Jai Guru Deva Om!<BR>The Beatles have and always will be the best band in the whole wide world, forever and ever!
B00005YU1O|1.0|Don't be fooled by the innovative animation techniques.  This movie is filled with unrealistic situations and improbable dialogue.  I knwe that when I am with my friends in a sports bar or club, we ignore our surroundings and chat about the complexities of life while sipping our beers and chomping on chicken wings.  I get the concept of what the director was attempting to do, but the idea of random people who just happen to all be educated about quantum physics, exhistentialism, and sociology is just plain nonsense (esp. Ethan Hawke.  Come on first you see him in Training Day then in a deeply philosophical musing? Come on.)  If you want to be bored for 99 minutes, peruse this tripe.
B00003CXA2|5.0|I remember going to the drive-in and the theatre to see this movie and even at the young age I was, I loved it. Little did I know that I could always come back to this movie when I was in high school and needed help with history. This movie should be shown in schools like in history classes. I love the character's in the movie from Forrest, Jenny, Bubba, Lt. Dan, and Mama. Forrest has a heart of gold and its nice to see a movie that the whole family can watch. My favorite scene was the hippy scenes.
0802136834|5.0|The story of Henry VIII's rule can only truly be told once a reader understands the vital importance attached to begetting an heir to the kingdom.  Alison Weir, as usual, offers this thoroughly-detailed, sometimes amusing, sometimes heartbreaking portrait of a man who, thwarted at nearly every turn from getting a queen who could produce strapping male heirs to the Throne of England, descended from a jolly, back-slapping prince to a fat, cruel and nearly despotic king, whose final wish to be buried alongside Jane Seymour must have cut his final surviving wife, Katherine Parr, to the quick.<br />But, as the title suggests, the primary thrust of this book is not so much Henry VIII as each of his unfortunate wives.  One learns a great deal more about them than the usual lines given by armchair historians.  For example, &quot;saintly&quot; Jane Seymour, usually depicted as a meek and mild young thing, was just as much a deliberate factor in the downfall of Anne Boleyn as her royal husband-to-be.  And as one reads about Anne Boleyn's temper, one teeters between sympathy for her and ... a vague feeling that perhaps Henry beheaded her not so much for failing to produce an heir as to get her to shut up and cease her constant nagging and ill-tempered outbursts.  (Of course, then you swing back into Anne's camp, figuring anyone living with someone like Henry would be ill-tempered ... or perhaps worse!)<br />And so it goes ...<br />Fascinating, chock full of details of court life and rife with facts from many primary sources, Alison Weir's account of Henry VIII and his wives remains a standard of its genre.
B00003CXGG|5.0|As the debut movie for Aaliyah, this was very impressive and entertaining at that! I loved this movie and I also love the sound track. If you are a big Aaliyah fan, you have to have this in your collection. Aaliyah displayed great acting, the action scenes were great, Jet Li and Aaliyah made a great combo, and the story line was well thought out. <BR>This movie was great!
B00003CXI1|5.0|...the film is enjoyable and it really does a good job of bringing the books to reality, as much as they can be for being fiction. Some people complain about the magic and witchcraft and sorcery. But I'm a baby boomer I grew up in the 60's and 70's watching Bewitched, Twlight Zone, Star Trek, etc...  I knew as a child that these things were not real, and thats the same thing that we teach our children. It's not real it is for entertainment and enjoyment. The whole thing is keeping it in perspective. It is an entertaining movie, and as long as you don't have little ones who might not be able to tell the difference in what they see. I think it is an okay watch.

6303471714|3.0|You will definitely get strong and buff when you work this tape, but BEWARE: it's not a good cardio workout and I did not really lose weight when doing this tape. I did, however, get very strong and muscular. That was very empowering. But I did not lose a lot of weight. My suggestion would be to alternate this tape with walking/jogging/running. And another thing, the side sit-ups made my waist thicker. So keep that in mind when doing the side sit-ups. Also, the side stretches in the beginning sometimes thicken the waist, too. Other than that, it's a fast work out. Do it if you want to get muscle. And what they say about her form is sort of true. Her form isn't perfect, but if you're in decent shape and don't get aches and pains easily, it shouldn't be too much of a problem. Just maintain the form yourself and realize she is doing it very fast. If you keep that in mind, you can just maintain the correct posture and form yourself. If you are used to doing one of the harder tapes from the Firm series, for example the Susan Harris tape, then this will seem rather easy to you. I do this tape when the prospect of doing the Firm is merely too much for me and makes me want to run under the covers and hide. On those tired days, I try a workout like this. That way, I am getting some exercise, but I'm not too drained. For beginners, this will be a hard tape, though.
B000059QY3|5.0|This is a beautiful stage production of \\"La Traviata\\" and it is FINALLY available on dvd!!! I waited years for this to happen!!<br />Ms. Gheorghiu has everything Verdi wanted Violetta to look like on stage. She outplays and outsings Teresa Stratas in the film version. The tenor played his role of Alfredo well, but his acting skills are limited. The baritone playing Giorgio Germont (Alfredo's father) appears distracted as he looks at the camera or at the audience. He however, sings his arias beautifully.<br />Overall, the production is magnigicent recorded in 5.1 channels of pure digital sound. The picture is also perfect. I was glad and sad to see the late Sir. Georg Solti conducting the orchestra with so much passion. He was one of the great conductors of our times together with Jeffrey Tate, Neville Mariner and Karajan to mention few.<br />I highly recommend it!!!
B00005YU1O|4.0|_Waking Life_ is not just the best animated film of last year; it's also the most original animated film to come along since Disney's _Fantasia_.  Director Richard Linklater's plotless meditation on existence occasionally grows a bit monotonous, but the ingenious, state-of-the-art visual style never fails to astonish.  The film doesn't reward multiple viewings so much as demand them.<br />The DVD features a flawless video and audio transfer of the film.  Extras include a director's commentary, a second commentary by twenty-five computer animators who worked on individual scenes, a gallery of deleted and rejected animation, and excerpts from Linklater's raw video footage (which was used as a template for the animation).  The overall package offers an in-depth look at the creation of this technical marvel.<br />For Linklater fans, animation buffs and philosophy junkies, this DVD is a must-own.
0553801481|4.0|Fool's Errand is Book 1 of the Tawny Man series written by Robin Hobb.  I haven't read the series that this one is a sequel to (the Farseer Trilogy), but I have read the Liveship Trader trilogy, which takes place in a different part of the same world.  I thought that series was outstanding, and was determined to read this one as soon as I could get my hands on it.<br />Was it worth it?  Definitely.  Hobb has a grasp of character that is simply marvelous to read, and the action usually isn't too bad either.  One of the wonderful things about this book is that, while it is part of a series, the book is self-contained.  There are plot threads that I'm sure will lead into the next book, but it doesn't end on a cliffhanger.  It's kind of like Terry Brooks' Shannara series used to be before he decided to go down the cliffhanger route.  The world as created by Hobb is well-crafted, the magic system is easy to understand.  Magic is not all-powerful, and its use has consequences.<br />Fitzchivalry Farseer has retired from his life as an assassin for the royal house.  Evidently, in the first series, he was apparently killed, and he's happy to leave most people with that misconception.  He's retired to the country to live with his wolf and bond-mate, Nighteyes, and with his foster son, Hap.  He's adopted the name Tom Badgerlock.  After fifteen years of this, he's reasonably happy with the way his life is going.  After a personal shake-up in his life, and a visit from his old mentor, Chade, he finds himself lacking something, though.  He's then called to the royal house for an important mission:  the prince has disappeared, and Fitz must find him.  Throughout the story, he must balance his desire for solitude with his loyalty to the Farseers.<br />The characters in this book are outstanding.  All of the main characters are three dimensional, they all have faults (there is no perfect hero).  Fitz has his doubts about his ability, about the use of his magic, about his foster son.  He's 15 years older than he was when he was an assassin, and you can tell.  His wolf is also older.  Age and the effects of aging actually play a significant role in the book.  Chade is also getting older, and he's not quite as capable of some things as he used to be. He's still extremely crafty, though, and he uses that.  The prince is also a very interesting character:  he's young, impetuous, moody at times (especially with what happens to him in the book).  He's not stereotypical at all.<br />The best character in the book, though, is the Fool.  I understand he plays a prominent role in the previous series as well, and his friendship with Fitz is very well-portrayed.  They have a love that is beyond friendship, beyond family, a bond that ties them very closely together.  He provides a lot of comic relief, but he's also very intelligent.  He plays the arrogant noble very well, but it's obvious to the reader that this is a role for him.<br />The only thing wrong with this book, and it does knock a star off of my rating, is the incredible slowness of the beginning.  It starts off very leisurely, taking its time to get where it wants to go.  Some events happen to Fitz in this section, but it's mostly illustrating what his life is like now, what he gave up to live like this, his conflict within himself about his magical ability.  Then the Fool shows up, and Hobb spends a large number of pages detailing what Fitz did in the 15 years since they had last met.  A lot of this sounds almost like a droning lecturer telling a personal history.  It got a bit tedious.  This section was only saved by my love for the characters and their portrayal.  I wanted to know what happened next.  This was my introduction to these characters, so I enjoyed that aspect of it.  But by page 75, I was really wishing Hobb would get on with things.<br />I reviewed another book that I couldn't finish, mainly because of the tediousness of the first half.  This book could easily have fallen into that trap too, and very nearly did.  But I carried on with it, knowing that something good would be coming.  Plus, I liked these characters, while the characters in the other book did nothing for me.  Thus, I had a bit of a hook left in me in this book that I didn't have in the other one.  Once it got going, though, the book is outstanding.<br />This is definitely a keeper.  Just keep slogging through the beginning.  It's worth it in the end.nto that trap too, and very nearly did.

B000024D4R|5.0|Pink Floyd is my favorite band, and I find this their greatest album.  The lyrics are brilliant, cynical, dark and very meaningful.  It is a concept album that groups people into three species:  Dogs, pigs and sheep. I haven't heard any lyrics better than these.  The music is flowing, and the instrument work is great.  Here's what I think of the individual songs:<br />Pigs on the Wing part 1:  Nice, calm song that starts off the record.  It's slow and nice, and without it, this album wouldn't be complete. Not my favorite, but it is essential.<br />Dogs:  Too long?  So what if it's about 20 minutes?  My second favorite, it has sarcastic, savage lyrics and sounds great.  It's fast, and perfect.  I love this one... The dogs are the ruthless, cruel money grubbers who will stab any one in the back to get what they want.  <br />Pigs (Three different ones): Now this is my favorite...  It has such great guitar work (or any instrument for that matter), it's deliciously flowing and the lyrics are some of the best I've ever heard.  This may be my favorite Floyd song of all-time. I really like the cynical ones...  It's about the fascist capitalists who are enforcing censorship and the like.  It's utterly perfect, and the surreal jam session in the middle is great too.  \\"Haha, charade you are!\\"<br />Sheep:  This is another good one, but not as good as the others.  The lyrics are a little exaggerated, but it's still fabulous.  I love the way the vocals turn into the background music.  It's certainly the creepiest song on here, too.  The sheep are (obviously) the mindless followers of pigs and dogs. <br />Pigs on the wing part 2:  Just like the first one, if this weren't here, the album wouldn't work.  It's the song that shows that the world isn't ALL horrible... <br />This is one of the great Floyd albums, but I don't recommend it first.  One of the firsts, but it may not be good for the early listener.  The album that makes me think that Pink Floyd is as good, if not better, asThe Beatles.
0696204800|3.0|This is a great block pattern book.  However as a beginner quilter, I have a hard time using this book to it's full potential because many of the patterns are a difficult and translating these blocks into a quilt requires some experience in figuring out how much fabric you'll need.  I am definitely keeping the book and I'm sure I'll use it more when I'm a bit more experienced.  I would recommend it to intermediate and advanced quilters.
B000002G8H|4.0|Many women (and men) purchase this cd for Wonderful Tonight.  However, I suggest that if you are looking for a love song, that you skip down a few tracks to We're All the Way.  It was our wedding song and everyone asked where it came from.  It was great!  This is classic 70's Clapton.  Need we say more??
B0000640VO|5.0|...I was not disappointed with Jeunet's latest work... but is very different in mood and tone. ...\\"Amalie\\" is light, innocent and delightfully funny.<br />Audrey Tautou is a real sweetheart, and shines brightly as the quirky young woman who seeks to touch the lives of those around her, both people she knows and total strangers.<br />I can't see anyone but the most hardened crusty cynic not being touched by this film (or perhaps someone totally out of touch with their feelings).<br />Surely this is one of the top 20 movies of all time. Can't wait to own this on on DVD!  The DVD extras sound great.
B00005JKDR|5.0|One of the best of the Pixar animated films yet!  \\"Monsters, Inc\\" is funny both for kids and adults.<br />Being a computer animation buff since the early days (TRON, Liquid TV, etc.) I was blown away by some of the visuals in this film.  Sully's hair is the most realistic to date in CG films.  The scene in the snowstorm blew my mind!  The lighting, Sully's hair blowing everywhere, etc. was a real visual treat.  The rendering of water was also the most realistic I have seen to date.  \\"Renderman\\", the software Pixar uses to render the 3D animations has to be one of the greatest inovations in movie making in 20 years. Can't wait to see what they come up with next.
B000002UB3|5.0|Nothing profound to say that hasn't already been said about this album.  I have listened to this album FAR more than any other in my (large) collection of music.  I think I have heard \\"Abbey Road\\" over 1,000 times, and it constantly amazes me that I don't get tired of it after all this time (I first heard it as a child in the 1970's, and recall \\"Maxwell's Silver Hammer\\" being my favorite tune, followed by \\"Octopus's Garden\\".)  Now that I am older, I am partial to \\"Come Together\\", and \\"I Want You (She's So Heavy)\\".<br /><br />I know many site \\"Sgt. Peppers\\" as the best Beatles album, but I still feel \\"Abbey Road\\" takes the cake.
630588255X|5.0|I usually don't have a single \\"favorite\\" of anything, but this film is overall my favorite movie of all time. Some of this has to do with the time when I first saw \\"Harold and Maude\\" (in my sullen late teens), but also because it is just such a mix of fun, sadness and joy, that still moves me to tears every time I see it (despite being rather cynical much of the time, I can still be a sentimental sap as well! :)<br />*Great* soundtrack by Cat Stevens (if you like his music). This film was my first introduction to Cat Stevens, and I still love his music from this film.<br />Overall, \\"Harold and Maude\\" is a great, yet unconventional love story, and one that stands the test of time. Bud Cort and Ruth Gordon are magic together.<br />Unfortunately, the DVD picture quality is not very good, and the sound is a bit muddy in spots, but I don't feel that this detracts from the film that much. (Normally I am a somewhat of an audio/video quality snob). It is *much* better than the worn out VHS copies I have viewed in the past. Also, yeah for widescreen! (Full screen \\"formated to fit your TV\\" is a MAJOR pet peave of mine.)
B00005QZWI|5.0|First off, this was one of the BEST soundtracks I have ever listened to in my life! Howard Shore captures Middle-Earth in his music so well that I actually believe that I am in Middle-Earth as I'm listening. If I had to pick a favorite, it would be either 'The Ring goes South' or 'The Breaking of the Fellowship'. When I listen to the Breaking of the Fellowship, I can just see the entire last part of the movie and I just can't believe how good the soundtrack is. For the Ring goes South, it has this sort-of heroic type theme about a minute into the song and you can imagine The Fellowship walking through Hollin or over Caradhras. I hope that we see more of Howard Shore's great music for The Two Towers and The Return of the King.
B00005YXZH|4.0|Much has been written about the commercial viability (or lack thereof) of Yankee Foxtrot Hotel. The fact of the matter is that some of the songs on this album are too slow and boring for my taste. My suggestion is the first time listening to this album to program in tracks #2, #4, #5, #7, #8, and #9. Six great catchy songs that are better than anything else I hear on the radio these days. After that, you can see if some of the other slower songs are either &quot;great art&quot; or just misfires from a great band.
B00003CXZ4|5.0|Heh.  Sorry--couldn't resist (first two are \\"Midnight Run\\" and \\"The Matrix\\").  Seriously, though, \\"Memento\\" has to be one of the most cleverly-constructed thrillers ever made.  Watching this movie is like peeling an onion, layer by layer by layer.  Each little jump back is packed with revelations about Pearce's character, the identity of \\"John G.\\", the little notes on Pearce's polaroids, the tattoos, and the very nature of his quest to find his late wife's killer.  As each flashback redounds upon the one that precedes it, one really gets the sense of seeing the protagonist's life run itself in reverse, as if through some chronological mirror, and mirrors are a prominent theme throughout the movie.  An unabashed triumph of pacing, plotting, and well-developed characters.  See.  This.  Soon.
B00005RYL9|4.0|I ordered this Anchor Bay edition (AKA The Immortal Edition) long before it was released because I wanted it so badly. Yes, I am a HUGE fan of the original Highlander, but hate the movies that followed and haven't really seen the series. The earlier release of the DVD (I believe it's the 10th anniversary edition) was dubbed &quot;The Underwater Edition&quot; because of horrid sound and apparently it had a few other problems as well. The Immortal Edition is excellent IMO. The picture and sound is great. The commentary is the same as the 10 anniversary edition but still entertaining and enlightening. No deleted scenes, but Queen videos, a stills gallery, and a host of other goodies. If you're a Lambert, Connery, Clancy, or Highlander fan, you will not be disappointed by this DVD.
B00003CX5P|1.0|In 1977, the original Star Wars (call it Episode IV if you prefer) changed the face of the movies. In an era of talky grown-up flicks and overwrought disaster pictures, the fun was finally back. Good guys were good, bad guys were bad, nobody really cared about why. There may have been cool gizmos and weird aliens, but this was an old-fashioned western crossed with a World War II movie, with a little bit of medieval chivalry and mysticism thrown in for fun. In short, the film was exciting from the first frame.<br />In 1999, the &quot;new and improved&quot; Star Wars (or Episode I for those who buy into such nonsense) had no discernible plot, incomprehensible dialogue, and uncharismatic characters who are neither good nor bad -- or maybe both at the same time, I don't know. Inexplicable action sequences are intercut with inexplicable dialogue sequences. Everybody on the screen looks so serious, as if they are doing something Very Important. Liam Neeson somehow manages to make being a Jedi knight look dull. This is not a western, nor is it a war movie, nor does it contain anything even the least bit chivalrous or mystical. It's greatest sin: This movie is boring from the first frame.<br />Frankly, if I wanted to watch people negotiate trade routes and treaties, I'd turn on C-SPAN.<br />Relentless special effects were not possible, nor were they necessary in 1977. All it took was a simple plot, characters who were just one step above types -- but charismatic -- and enough details to make us believe we were somewhere else for a couple of hours.<br />Limitations can force movie-makers to become better story-tellers. Lucas was limited by time and money back in the 70s, and that first film is a model of efficiency. Now there's nobody to say 'no' to him. The result, as probably could have been predicted, is a self-indulgent mess slathered with CGI. Yes, the effects in this movie are way cool. No, they did not make it any more palatable. No amount of effects or DVD extras canmake up for a boring story.<br />I know that Lucas is trying to create a modern hero myth -- he has openly admitted as much. But he's clearly trying too hard. Time to get back to having fun, George.<br />+
B000002LIM|5.0|What can I say? It's a great sounding CD and is some of Elfman's best work ever.
B000007UA4|4.0|Until Light Years, I regarded this as Kylie's best album - heck, even NME, British Indie Bible magazine suggested it be album of the month when it was reviewed by them!! A very credible turn around for former teen-pop girl next door, one might say.  Let's Get To It is the last chapter in SAW years by Kylie & contains very diverse but strong songs, many of which Kylie lent a pen to.  The album yielded 4 UK Top 20 hits including Chairmen of the Board cover song Give Me Just A Little More Time (No2), Word Is Out (No18 - her only song to date which failed Top 6), Finer Feelings (very lush, No 11) & a gorgeous duet with Keith Washington, If You Were With Me Now (No3).  However, it is the album trax which steal the show.  Too Much of a Good Thing is a very enticing & whispery song driven along by a pulsating drum beat & sweet chorus.  Very diverse & unexpected. However it does sample Janet Jackson's Control (''I Hope You Enjoy This As Much As I Do''). As is I Guess I Like It, a 6 minute dancathon romp which was part of the nascent of Brit dance music. If you didn't know this was Kylie, you would imagine it to have been done by a great dance producer.  This song rocks & is guided by a few lyrical refrains (a bit like Janet Jackson's Throb), & it makes you move.  There's a tender ballad called World Without You which is nice - an acousic guitar & Kylie's voice. Singular & mesmerising revelation of the strength of Kylie's voice.  My personal fave is an unabashhed dance-type song called Right Her. Right Now.  Joyous, whirly, with a killer chorus, it shoulda-been-a-single, as should many other tracks on the album.  It really is a consistent opus by Kylie & showcases the strength of her voice, her song-writing skills, but more importatly, Kylie's ability to take risks & ensure her longevity.  11 years later & the world eats great big lunps form her hand!! Inspiring stuff well worth investigation if you like pop with an edge.  MOreover, these songs had significant strength live!I saw the 1991 Tour in Dublin (& you even see my gorgeous face in the audience!) - true testimony to the fact that pop music can be 'real'.
0805062971|4.0|Ever notice that if you're forced to read something, it bores you?  But if you want to read something, you'll get it done quicker.  Then there's that category where if a book really interests you, you'll finish it in two days and recommend it to your High School Sophomore brother who is failing English and hates to read, but you convince him to read it and actually does and loves it!  That's where Fight Club stands.<br />I've read a lot of reviews about the movie and the book where the critic says \\"this is a story about this guy Jack\\".  No! His name is not Jack!  He is simply the narrator.  Palahniuk decided to leave the narrator nameless to convey the hidden psychological background of the story, hidden beneath the richly textured philosophy that he's trying to bring to light.  In the book, the narrator reads a \\"Reader's Digest\\" magazine where there are 1st person articles written \\"by\\" a person's bodily organs.  In the movie, \\"I am Jack's colon.\\"  In the book, \\"I am Joe's broken heart.\\"  I just wanted to clear up that confusion.<br />Fight Club is the tale of two men who are looking for a way to reach bottom.  Self-destruction.  Only when you lose everything are you free to do anything.  The narrator, works as a car company's recall coordinator.  A times B times C is equal to x.  Tyler Durden, he only works night jobs because of his nature.  He's a projectionist, clipping snipits of porn into family entertainment.  He also works as a waiter.  The guerilla waiter.  Urinating in richest of rich persons' soup.<br />The narrator is plagued by insomnia, where everything in his world is a copy of a copy of a copy, there is no difference between falling asleep and being awake.  He meets up with Tyler Durden and his life is changed.  After the explosion and destruction of his condo and his materialistic world, it's all downhill from here.  But losing what you consider your life, the objects that make you who you are, isn't that bad is it?  Deliver me from Swedish Furniture!  May I never be content!  And so, the narrator meets Tyler Durden.<br />But let's back up.  The narrator goes to support groups for things like testicular cancer, bowel parasites, brain diseases, etc...  Being able to let himself go in these places helps him get rid of his insomnia and sleep at night.  But this world is crashed by a woman.  Marla Singer... Marla. Marla. Marla.  Marla, cigarette smoking, black hair, steals clothes and sells them to earn money, eats dead people's Meals on Wheels, that she accepts saying that they are in bed, the woman that invaded the narrator's peace.  Faker.  Liar.<br />After Marla invades the narrator's world, he and Tyler start new support groups, fight clubs, where people who aren't afraid to lose it all go to beat the hell out of each other.  This is their white ball of healing light.  But that's not all.  Tyler takes Fight Club to a whole new level, giving each member terrorist-style homework assignments that all somehow add to Tyler's master plan... that only he knows.<br />These three characters are brought together in such a fashion that you'll be wondering what will happen next until the end, and of course, like the movie, the big surprise ending.  I will warn you, the movie and the book are VERY different.  The movie doesn't follow the book in chronological order and the endings are extremely different.<br />I will recommend Fight Club to everyone.  Even if you've seen the movie first, the book is definitely worth reading.  After every chapter, your view of society will change.  Maybe you'll want to follow in Tyler's footsteps, but you know it isn't possible.  You are not a beautiful and unique snowflake.  You know that everyone is materialistic to an extent, but Fight Club lets you see a world without any materialistic value.  Bring 500 dollars in personal burial money.  Only in death, do we all have names.  Perhaps a fight should be scheduled between Ayn Rand and Chuck Palahniuk.  You ARE unique!  No you aren't.  POW!I want you to hit me as hard as you can.  Fight Club begins.<br />My power animal is also a penguin.  A drunken penguin.  You thought they walked funny when they were sober.  Slide.  Crash. Slide again.!  I want you to hit me as hard as you can.  Fight Club begins.<br />My power animal is also a penguin.  A drunken penguin.  You thought they walked funny when they were sober.  Slide.  Crash. Slide again.
B000002OHF|3.0|I have to agree with my compatriot from Basingstoke, that this must have been a hard album to make following what went before, and frankly, it was a bit of a disappointment. There are signs that they couldn't repeat the eclectic writing on Pilgrimage and Argus, but were looking for a more commercial, mainsteam sound. So, among Ballad of the Beacon and Sorrel we get Rock and Roll Widow (surely a refugee from one of a dozen inferior boogie bands) and No Easy Road (horns on a Wishbone Ash album? - Climax Blues Band maybe, but not the Ash). Everybody Needs a Helping Hand is rather lachrymose, saved by a decent solo, and Sing Out The Song limps along in an amiable, baggy-old-dog kind of way, but there really is only song that gets my ears pricking up and that's Ballad..... Still, I do listen to my old vinyl copy now and again ... in fact I only have vinyl Wishbone Ash, this was the last album of theirs I bought.
B00005JKNF|5.0|Great ensemble acting with lots of humour (and fun). Rather than being a true murder mystery, it's more a satire on the hypocrisy of class divisions in pre-WWII England. While the pace is slow (but not overly so), there're lots of interesting and amusing elements which prop up almost every minute. Lovely cinematography and a soothing soundtrack add to its appeal. A little out of the main-stream perhaps, but extremely enjoyable nonetheless.
B00005YXZH|5.0|At first I thought this was Radiohead meets the Grateful Dead. Now, after multiple listenings I've decided this what 'The Band' would have sounded like if they were 20 years younger.
B00005MKRV|4.0|Let me start off by saying that I am an ex-Eminem fan.  I still like his music, but his lyrics just got too extreme for me.  That said, this album is worth getting, for the music ONLY.  Every song has a great beat and great tunes.  If you can find an instrumental version of the CD, get that.
0385503954|2.0|I found the ending destructive to the story.  I wish that the final thoughts, questions, premise, etc.  would have evolved within the readers minds without such blatant delineation.<br />Sorry, but the story wasn't as startling as the critics reviews (hype).
0767903862|5.0|This was my first Bill Bryson book and as a result of reading it, I have now read all of his books.  It is informative and full of neat facts without being scientific or dull.  And, as always with Bill Bryson, truly funny.  I am always amazed at how a middle-aged guy travelling alone can make his days sound so interesting.<br />I read this book before my husband had the chance and was constantly interupting him to read him passages, even though they were sometimes incomprehensible because I was laughing so hard!!  The interesting thing is that once he started reading the book, he read the same passages aloud to me, even though he knew full well that I knew exactly what he was going to say.  The best part was they were just as enjoyable the second time.<br />I love how Bryson seems to portray himself and his experiences honestly.  Sometimes I am reading along thinking what a jerk he is for describing people or places with so little tact, but then I realize that he is only daring to write the things so many of us often think.  I respect, too, that he applies those same critical eyes to himself and his own behavior.<br />There is one thing that ticked me off - this book is also published under the title &quot;Down Under&quot;.  So, I, of course, grabbed it off the shelf in the airport, thinking I was getting volume two of Bryson's escapes in Australia.   It is a great book, but I don't need two copies!! Don't make the same mistake as me.
0805062971|5.0|In his stunning debut novel, Fight Club, Chuck Palahniuk takes a deep, hard look at today's twenty and thirty-somethings and wonders where in this generation is the blood and thunder that once caused human beings to topple empires and stage revolutions. \\"You have a class of young, strong men and women and they want to give their lives to something,\\" remarks Fight Club's nameless narrator, \\"Advertising has these people chasing cars and clothes they don't need. Generations have been working in jobs they hate, just so they can buy what they don't really need.\\"<br />This dark, brooding young man becomes woefully unsatisfied with his consumer-lifestyle and soon develops strange neurosis. He attends support groups for diseases with which he is not afflicted and restlessly travels from airport to airport, just for the pleasure of waking-up in a different place each day.<br />Then he meets Tyler Durden.<br />Tyler becomes his drinking buddy and eventually his roommate when a mysterious explosion destroys the narrator's condominium. \\"I want you to do me a favor,\\" the mysterious, charismatic and outspoken Tyler declares one day, \\"I want you to hit me as hard as you can.\\" The narrator is at first apprehensive at such an odd request but Tyler determinedly insists. The punch opens the door for all of the narrator's darker impulses.<br />Soon after, he and Tyler found Fight Club, a weekly, underground gathering where young men vent their frustrations in brutal, one-on-one brawls. \\"After a night at fight club, everything in the real world gets the volume turned down,\\" the narrator states, \\"Nothing can piss you off, your word is law, and if other people break the law or question you, even that doesn't piss you off.\\" Soon Fight Club develops an almost religious following among unhappy, unloved, understimulated young men. Under Tyler's command Project Mayhem, an all-out anarchistic terrorist group braches from Fight Club. As Project Mayhem's activities become more violent and prolific, the narrator is worried how far Tyler will go and who this abrasive street-guru truly is.<br />Fight Club is the most comprehensive, thought-provoking and well-written novel to explore violent behavior since A Clockwork Orange by Anthony Burgess, if not ever. Mr. Palahniuk obviously underwent extensive contemplation of the emptiness and frivolity of today's society and how it has caged and choked mankind's more dark, aggressive instincts. \\"We are the middle children of history, raised by television to believe that someday we'll be millionaires and movie stars and rock stars, but we won't. And we're just learning this fact. So don't f-ck with us,\\" declares Tyler. Fight Club captures the very essence of soulless consumer culture bursting at the seams, unleashing an onslaught of chaos, brutality and passion.
B00005JKDR|5.0|My husband, my 4 year old daughter and I went to see Monsters, Inc. and we ALL loved it.  Pixar has really outdone itself.  This movie had all of the right messages in it: 1) If you have a job to do, do it well. 2)  Always stand up for what is right. 3) Help your friends when they need it. 4) It doesn't matter what a person looks like or what you've been told about them, get to know them yourself and make up your own mind.  5) Do not be afraid to speak up when you see something wrong. 6) Laughing is always better than crying. and 7) People are more powerful when they are happy.
B000002LVB|4.0|The Velvet Underground may have been revolutionaries, but, in a way, they were also purists. Although the band's many, winding distortion marathons (\\"European Sun,\\" \\"Lady Godiva's Operation,\\" \\"Sister Ray\\" ect.) were certainly more avant-garde and ambitious, most of their songs (such classics as \\"I'm Waiting for the Man,\\" \\"Run Run Run,\\" \\"There She Goes Again\\" and \\"White Light/White Heat\\" among them) were grounded in simplistic Bo Diddley-ish riff-rock. In an age when albums such as Sgt. Pepper's and Electric Ladyland had convinced pop musicians that their purpose was to create glistening, elaborate epics, The Velvets' work (always the antithesis of the prominent trends of their day) was the hallmark of artists unashamed to be rock and rollers. When the most far-out musician in their line-up, keyboard-player and violist, John Cale, left in 1968, the group gravitated towards more traditional pop music.<br />The Velvet Underground's most-pop minded album is by far 1970's Loaded. Guitarist/songwriter, Lou Reed had obviously not lost the pop sensibilities that landed him a job as a staff songwriter for Pickwick Records in the mid-1960s. Concise, clean-cut and catchy, the songs of Loaded are closer to Memphis soul and 50s rock and roll (Loaded's \\"Rock & Roll\\" could have easily been written by Chuck Berry who penned similarly-minded rock anthems like \\"Roll Over Beethoven,\\" \\"Johnny B. Goode\\" and \\"Rock & Roll Music\\") than anything the Velvets had ever produced. The irony is that, with their precise wit and impeccable sense of melody, songs such as \\"Train Round the Been\\" \\"Who Loves the Sun,\\" \\"Rock & Roll\\" and \\"Sweet Jane,\\" were as melodic, infectious and clever as the best tracks of those pop movements. These former Andy Warhol prot&eacute;g&eacute;s, who had previously explored taboo subject matter such as sadomasochism and drug addiction and turned-up their amps to drench their music in deformation and abrasion, were writing simply great pop songs.<br />The Velvet Underground had not lost all of the chicness, though. Although not nearly as edgy as their previous three albums, Loaded maintains the typical VU cast of hipsters and burnouts and the typical VU scenery of street corners and more street corners. With the exception of the what-were-they-thinking novelty tune, \\"Lonesome Cowboy Bill\\" and the syrupy ballad \\"I Found a Reason,\\" Loaded remains one definitively cool record. Mr. Reed and company merely decided to tone-down the abrasion, smooth their edges and create an album of suave, crafty poprock. It's a strain that has always been in there genes. On Loaded they explored that part of their chemistry fully, creating a few of the hippest, as well as flat-out best, pop songs the world has ever heard.
0380788624|5.0|You need a clear mind to read this--its great for traveling with.  A 900 page hardcover text, this book draws the reader in and makes a great blend between two different story lines in two deifferent decades.  Stephenson is a fantastic writer-- and by that I mean he is one who goes beyond things, I do not just comment on the greatness of his ability--but the fantasy is stretched only far enough that it is possible...and that's kind of scary.  I included his work in a conference on Modern Fiction as a Self-Educational or Classroom TOol, along with Crichton.
B000009ED0|1.0|ok, what's the deal with this guy?  He curses, he shouts, he raps, yet where are the good songs?  I really had a problem with this music.  Kid Rock seems to be popular, though I feel he will be forgotten in a few years, kind of like so many one hit wonder acts that come and go.  Rock has no staying ability, cannot write a good song, or carry a tune.  Does anyone agree?
0446678430|5.0|For me this book is the best yet of the Rich Dad series.  It is a must read for all business owners or those who wish to start a business.
B00004T9UF|5.0|The Marshall Mathers LP is my soulmate -- 5 stars means 5 stars all the way.  While it doesn't have as much humour as the Slim Shady LP did, it has so much self-expression of his personnal feelings of anger and rebellion, packaged in rhythms and rhymes that are over the top in creativity and innovation.  It's those rhythms and rhymes that make you stop and take notice, and force you to believe that Eminem is something special.
0140188711|5.0|Albert Cohen's masterpiece is intimidating both for its size and chapter-long sentences. But, please, do not be discouraged. This is one of the most insightful novels I have read. It delves into the bureacratic labyrinth of international institutions, mocks their functionaries, and is a haunting critique of European virtues on the eve of the Second World War. (Particularly funny for those familar with the World Bank, UN, or government anywhere).<br />But, most importantly, it portrays the relationship between men and women in a profound yet comic way. The book's difficulty is quite worth the struggle, especially when you reach the chapter where Solal seduces his beloved. A chapter that is hard for me to forget, for it shows just how stupid and cruel we are.<br />This is not for the lazy readers, but if you have any guts, read this one. Its worth the while.
B00000IFWE|5.0|I have decide to give this FIVE starsdespite the song about &quot;elephant balls&quot;. One bad song/lyric does not ruin a great album such as this. This is probably his best since Damn The Torpedoes. Personally I like it better.THe band sounds great. It's got a good country/rock vibe. A good alternative to  Wilco/Whiskeytown's version of alt-country. It's amazing to hear such quality work from Tom Petty 20 years down the line.Hope he can keep up the good work.
B00005R2M3|1.0|This disc (it's not a true CD, according to Phillips) includes a copy prevention mechanism which may actually damage your PC, Mac, PS2, XBox, or standalone DVD player. Do not buy this disc if you want to play it on any of these devices.
0446677450|2.0|Overall, I thought that Rich Dad, Poor Dad was not so rich in content, and rather poor in writing. The author of this book did not do a good job of putting all of his thoughts together in this badly written book. One thought seemed to jump from the next without any connection. Furthermore, the ideas and lessons presented in this book seemed rather obvious to me, and it was hard to understand why someone would need to read such a book at all, for everything in it seemed to be nothing more than common sense. I do not reccomend this book to anyone who truley wants to learn how to manage their finances.

630027120X|5.0|This is one of the most soulful movies ever made.  Incredible cinematography.  De Niro and Irons masterfully play their roles.  The scene of Mendoza's redemtion is the most powerful emotional moment on film that I've ever experienced.  Provoking, tragic and beautiful. ...
B000002UJQ|5.0|I love this CD! I know every song by heart. Iv'e listened to it like a thousand times. This CD hs every kind of song. The lyrics are interesting and not boring at all. They get a little wird sometimes but thats ok. I have all of RadioHead's CD's and this was my first one to get. I still think i is the best CD they've ever put out. I listen to it all the time thinking its gonna be boring but every time I listen It gets better and better. Airbag, the first track, has the best beat on the CD. The first time I listened to the album I had no idea what they were saying but once I learned the lyrics it blew me away. The gutitar solos in the song are excellent. Paranoid Andriod (track 2) Is ok but there are much better songs on the album. Subterranian Homesick Alien (track 3) Is a really good chill out song. Exit Musc (4) Is also really good for a chill out song. Let Down (5) is probobly one of the best song on the CD. The lyrics are so amazing in this song. I love this song soooo much. &quot;Don't get sintemental it always ends up drivil&quot; is the best part of the song. In Karma Police (6) John Greenwod plays one of the best piano peices on the CD. The lyrics are also wonderful. Electioneering (8) is a wonderful song with a great guitar solo at the beggining. The lyrcs in his song are the best on the CD. It is such an energetic song which makes it so good. Cimbing Up  The Walls (9) is not that great. No suprises (10) is yet another a good chill out song. Lucky (11) is such a good song! I'm running out of words for good. But it is so good I made a bet and lost five dollars on the song! (don't ask). The lyris are enchanting. The tourist (12) is a great song with lyrics so good it is irresistable to not sing! Th lng dragged out words in the song are loveable. As you can proboly see after reading my review I love the lyrics and the entire CD. When I say a track is ok I mean it to be barely under the level of greatest song ever written. I love everysong on this album so much! This hs got to be in the top 3 CD's ever produced!
B000056K04|4.0|Dave Matthews and his band delivered another album showcasing what they do best: producing good music. On this album you'll find catchy rhythms in tracks like \\"Dreams Of Our Fathers\\" and especially \\"I Did It\\" ... The guitar riffs at the beginning of the song are enough to get you to jump out of your seat, and the wisecracking lyrics will keep you entertained as well.<br />Exceptional lyrical quality can also be found elsewhere on the album. \\"If I Had It All\\" is an interesting track that ponders what else in life would there be to look forward to if he had everything. \\"Sleep To Dream Her\\" is a basic yet infectious can't-get-her-off-my-mind song, and \\"Angel\\" follows almost the same pattern. Then there's the love-filled title track, which has just the right touch of promise to successfully end the album.<br />The most innovative song on the album is \\"Mother Father\\", which has Dave metaphorically asking why there are so many problems in the world. (That really hits home NOW, doesn't it?) A close second would be my personal favorite \\"The Space Between\\", whose lyrics will have you thinking indefinitely, not to mention its having the best music I've heard in a long time.<br />The chorus to \\"Fool To Think\\" sounds like Dave's singing is working against the music rather than alongside it, but that doesn't get in the way of a very noteworthy album. This one's a keeper.
6300214435|1.0|First off, I'm 1/2 Indian(Mother is from Queens, NYC). Indian food is my favorite food in the world(literally). Because of movies like this one, it completely distorts America's view of India and the countries surrounding it. Now, when I go for Indian food, my friends say something to the effect of, \\"Eww..don't they eat bugs or something?\\" Go to an Indian restaraunt. If it isn't THE best food you have EVER tasted, then it isn't a good restaraunt.<br />  This movie successfully is racist, historically inaccurate(it was the Aztecs or something similar that did the human sacrifice involving removing of the heart), and annoying at the same time. \\"I'm Indiana Jones, and this is Mr. Round\\"(the only thing more annoying than short round is the constant screaming of Capshaw, whose constant screaming drives you to insanity)<br />  \\"The Christian God will fall!\\" When was the last time the Hindu people went on a holy war to try to unite the world under Hinduism?<br />In I and III Jones had a reason to go on an adventure: the Nazis were going to acquire the Arc/Holy Grail and then take over the world, but in this movie, he goes off looking for a STONE.
B000002J0G|5.0|Having always been partial to the seemingly primal growls of the dark/thrash metal vocalist.  They are nothing alone without the power of screaming guitar, booming bass, and bone crushing drums.  This album has all of that in my opinion.  As far as I am concerned, Testament has come the long haul and been true to themselves the whole way.  Chuck Billy is all that and a piece of cake, but then again the whole of Testament is that.  The title track Low is one of my favorites.  Anyone who appreciates the darker, deeper metal will love this album.  Definitely a must have for any Testament fan and a worth have for Metal fans.
B000059XY3|5.0|&quot;Batman Forever&quot; is, without a doubt, the best film in Warner Bros. &quot;Batman&quot; feature film series. Full of action and emotion. Val Kilmer proves to be a great actor (this film follows his classic performance as Doc Holliday in the classic western flick &quot;Tombstone), and is the best pick for the dark night. Other fine performances by Tommy Lee Jones, Jim Carrey, Nicole Kidman (who is the hottest babe in hollywood), and Chris O'Donnell. Followed by the abysmal &quot;Batman and Robin.&quot; Grade: A+<br />P.S.: Nicole, if you're reading this, my I have your number?

0446677450|2.0|Robert Kiyosaki explores the influences he recieved from his two &quot;dads&quot;: his father, who is well educated, but financially unstable, and his best friend's dad, who dropped out of school in eighth grade, but is now a millionaire.  His main theme was showing how to &quot;make your money work hard for you instead of working hard for your money.&quot;  This book contains valuable lessons in investing, and is easy to understand for someone, like me, who doesn't know much about it.  However, Kiyosaki starts repeating himself and becomes dull as the book progresses.  Unless this subject really interests you, the book becomes boring.
0440133688|5.0|Samuel Shem gives the reader a hysterical, yet frightening view of life as an intern.  The deeds and misdeeds of the new doctors at times border on the incredulous, yet demonstrate the irony of the hospital titled House of God.  For it is not an institution filled with white-coated divinities, but with people.  Humans, who cannot, try as they might, separate themselves from their backgrounds, biases, sexual desires, emotional needs, mistakes---their humanness.

B000002LCK|4.0|This was one of the best new order albums ever. However having said that, the CD version of 'Substance' has the 12&quot; version of &quot;Perfect Kiss&quot; but its not the true 12&quot; version as on the original 12&quot; that was released on Factory Records uk. But it sounds almost identical, on the 'Substance' album 3 minutes of the song was edited out, I guess for more space on the CD. The LP (vinyl edition) version of 'Substance' if you can get a copy had the true 12&quot; version unedited as well as all the other substance songs. The reason I'm writing this is because once you get into the song like I have with the 12&quot; versions and then listen to it on the CD only edited slightly it still makes you think about the fact. But all and all its a great album.
078401213X|5.0|Pi is about a very bright, but still very paranoid genius who belives he's about to crack the code of the universe. People belive him. Soon some stock broke workers want, and a group of Jews want what is in his head. A 216 digit long number that's supposed to be the number of God. The end of the movie should leave you speechless.<br />The movie brings up all kinds of very perfound thoughts and ideas to anyones mind. It still dose not matter if like math or not. Rent Pi or buy it. I highly suggest you watch this.
B000002KET|4.0|Before I go on, I should admit that I am not and never have been a huge Black Sabbath fan.  Although I will concur that they pioneered the heavy metal genre, I am not a heavy metal fan.  <BR>However, the recent rise of Osbourne from rock star to MTV household name has made me go back and re-listen to all of the Sabbath albums with his name on it, and out of them &quot;Sabbath Bloody Sabbath&quot; stood out as the most diverse and sophisticated.<BR>As a progressive rock fan, this should come as no surprise, as the album contains some keyboard work by Rick Wakeman (surprisingly spare and tasteful compared to his solo stuff, although your average metal fan will be put off by it), a quiet instrumental entitled &quot;Fluff&quot;, and several compositions like &quot;Spiral Architect&quot; that move through different sections, enveloping a kind of light/heavy contrast similar to Led Zeppelin.  Even the cover seems to have had more effort put into it.  What is great about the album is that while turning toward<BR>a more progressive direction, it does not sacrifice any of the group's earlier power: the title track, &quot;Sabbra Cadabra&quot; and &quot;Killing Yourself To Live&quot; are just as deliciously heavy/sludgy as anything on &quot;Paranoid&quot; or &quot;Master Of Reality&quot;--  it's just that now, they are more tuneful and better produced as well.  <br />Close-minded metal fans who merely want to hear an entire album's<BR>worth of &quot;Iron Man&quot;'s and &quot;Sweet Leaf&quot;'s have derided the couple<BR>of tracks on this album that provide diversity (namely, the acoustic-pretty &quot;Fluff&quot; and the synth-laden &quot;Who Are You&quot;), but<BR>anyone who appreciates the way classic albums from that period<BR>evoked different moods will come to view &quot;Sabbath Bloody Sabbath&quot; as one of their most finely crafted efforts, combining the classic primitive sound of the first three albums with a newfound finesse.
B00005JKCF|5.0|Perhaps the best super-hero movie made to date, Spider-Man delivers on the hype with an updated and interesting take on the wall-crawler's origin and a wonderful performance from both Toby Maguire as Spidey/Peter Parker and Wilem Dafoe as the nemesis Green Goblin/Norman Osborn.<br />The characters seem to stay true to their classic motivations as backed up by some 40-odd years of mythology. There is something for all movie fans in this film, as the love-interest played by Kirsten Dunst as Mary-Jane Watson provides nice counterpoint to the battle scenes with Spider-Man and his various contagonists.<br />Also, in a small but dead-on role, the actor that plays J.Jonah Jamison, the editor of the paper 'The Daily Bugle' looks like he could have been cloned right from the comic book page, if such a thing were possible. His part is fun and funny.<br />It seemed like all the actors were having a good time with this project and it shows in the performances.<br />I wouldn't take my 5 year-old, though. The Green Goblin would scare the teeth out of his mouth!<br />Go see this movie as soon as you can.
B000002KFJ|4.0|The last good Black Sabbath album, although a transitional effort from the early releases, &quot;Sabotage&quot; continues the progressive experimentation of &quot;Sabbath Bloody Sabbath&quot; while simultaneously amping the heavy quotient, making for some of the band's most intense moments.  The two highlights of the work are &quot;Symptom Of The Universe&quot; and &quot;The Writ&quot;, two epics that are quite possibly the two best tracks in their catalogue.  &quot;Symptom Of The Universe&quot;, which is much faster than the usual Sabbath<BR>anthem, looks forward to speed-metal, while &quot;The Writ&quot; matches<BR>a killer riff with an atmospheric production that provides the chilling final moments to the album.  &quot;Hole In The Sky&quot; and &quot;Megalomania&quot; are also good tracks, very much in the classic mold, although the album is let down by &quot;Supertzar&quot; (an aimless<BR>guitar noodle with a pretentious choir backing) and &quot;Am I Going Insane&quot; (which screams &quot;commercial sellout&quot;).  If it weren't for these two embarrassments, &quot;Sabotage&quot; would be an even more powerful and cohesive statement than &quot;Master Of Reality&quot; or &quot;Sabbath Bloody Sabbath&quot;; it's strange that it is generally overlooked and underrated among fans.  For even though I don't even consider myself a big Black Sabbath fan, this album succeeds on its own merits.

B00005R2M3|4.0|I bought 'Laundry Service' based on the song 'Whenever, Wherever' which is an excellent song co-wrote by the hugely talented Gloria Estefan.<BR>This CD is a real mixture of sounds, mostly latin, but there's a real 80's pop undertone too.  The first three tracks are by far the best and the Spanish versions of 'Whenever, <BR>Wherever' and 'Objection' are just as catchy as the English Versions.<BR>Shakira is beautiful and has an unusual voice which strangely enough works really well.  Once you have heard this CD, you'll be hooked.
B00005NWM3|2.0|Contrary to the ignorant people who either give this 1 or 5 stars, I know that this CD actually is not half as bad, or good, as they state it to be. I feel people with personal hatred of this type of music should not be able to write reviews, and those too narrowminded should not be allowed to rate anything with 4-5 stars, as they lack the capacity of giving suggestion to anyone else. This CD, Silver Side Up, by Nickelback is a mediocre album. It lacks originality in all but two songs: \\"Two Bad\\" and \\"How You Remind Me\\", these two, any pop-rock band would be proud of. As for a 'return to rock', this band does not have the ability of bringing 'rock' back as much as uncreative 'pop'.

B00004Z459|4.0|This cd is an awsome cd. Most of the songs on here are very well put together and well done. Most of todays big hit artists only put one good song on an alubm and become a big hit. Linkin Park deserves a much better praise then any of those other big bands. Mostly because they have plenty of goods songs on the cd to keep me listening to the cd over and over again with out me having to keep pressing the skip button all the time. This cd is defiantly worth it.
B00005JKCF|4.0|So so acting, I thought Toby Maguire was much better in Cider House Rules, but great special effects. Who cares because everyone connected with this years box office smash made millions. Some necessary editing caused a delay in the release, but it was worth the wait. The WTO scenes had to be cut. And we now settle in for a super cinematic treat.<br />I thought the Goblin was kind of goofy. A more dramatic foe would have been Venom or Carnage. Let's hope one of them will pop up in the next episode.<br />I was happy to see that the movie's rating allowed for the little ones (kids) to view the film. On the other hand the death scene was much more graphic then any comic book Stan Lee or Todd Mc Farland had ever penned. It's a shame too. I really don't think our small-fry need to be exposed to violence in a super-hero film. Star Wars? I suppose it's inevitable.<br />For non-stop action, thrills, and spills, Arachnoid-man has it and more. Recommended.  Cammy Diaz
B00005A1PR|5.0|India.Arie's debut album is, in a word, beautiful.  If you only have enough money to buy one CD, and you love gorgeous vocals, heartfelt lyrics, and inspiration rhythms, then buy this album.  India's music is a refreshing change from modern &quot;pop&quot; music which has no substance or reality.  I will be anxiously waiting in line to buy her next release...
B000003S2O|5.0|No Ambient recording has come this close to being a classic. Ambient one was a acoutic piano new age sound alike while Ambient 4 truely defines ambient. The album contains tracks which Eno has masterfully uses sound from the environment (your ambient) to create music. Truly profound is the way how silence could be made audible and then slowly create mood and finally a tune in the silence. Every environmental sound blends in beatifully. The most amazing track is  &quot;Unfamiliar Wind&quot; where frogs croak was used as a wind instrument, beautiful music was  composed using the sound of frogs croaking in the night. This record challendges you to listen intently to the sound of silence and the music that nature plays for us every moment of our life. This is truly ambient.
0198534469|1.0|this is a masterpiece by needham yet it lacks the educational interest that was shown in his other books . I was left after the first page  feeling like that my mind was not stimulated enough.
1878424319|5.0|This book was recommended to me by a friend.  When I first started reading the book I was a bit turned off by some of the references to &quot;magic&quot; but I'm glad I got past that... Taken as a whole, this is a truly wonderful book, which changed my entire outlook on life.
B00005JKED|5.0|Great movie.  Jake Hoyt's \\"training day\\", is his first day on the LAPD as a narc.  As a first-day rookie, he has no idea of what to expect, no knowledge of good and evil as it pertains to his work.  Therefore, he cannot respond correctly, and uses the only sensibility he has available to himself: the ability to reason.  This is the main thread around which the whole movie is woven, and makes clear to us that experience pays.  Training Day is as realistic as you're gonna get as far as the world in L.A., and why we're all afraid to leave our homes after dark, no matter where we live (como no, ese?).  It clarifies how the line between what's right and wrong can get blurred, and that we all perceive things differently, especially Alonzo Harris.  The verbiage is typical fare you'd expect from repeat offenders.  I think you'll like it.  I especially liked Bone (Cle \\"Shaheed\\" Sloan); he's a natural for the part, and cute, to boot!
B00005Q66T|3.0|This is not a showcase of her best work of the 90's.  If you have no intentions of ever buying another Madonna album and only like or know the songs on the pop top 40 countdown, than this is the Madonna CD for you.
B00005JKCF|4.0|Since his inception onto the comic book scene in 1962, Spider-Man has enthralled two generations of teens and adults alike.  As a teenager I can vividly remember many days spent at my friend's house, seeing a Spider-Man comic book collection so large that it protruded from under his bed in a huge cardboard box.  He kept each issue individually wrapped in its own plastic case, treating them like exquisite artifacts that an archaeologist might dig up at the Great Pyramid of Egypt.  Despite who my friends were, I never really read comic books and thus failed to comprehend their appeal.  However, I found the new cinematic adaptation of Spider-Man invigorating, injecting an infusion of vitality into a comic book movie I haven't experienced since director Tim Burton's Batman in 1989.  <BR> <BR>Spider-Man is a vast improvement over the recent X-Men movie adaptation.  Spider-Man didn't suffer from the superfluous dull exposition that plagued X-Men.  The first hour of the film entertained me more that the action packed second hour.  We are treated to many humorous incidences when Peter Parker is discovering his new powers.  At the screening I attended the theater erupted with laughter at them.  <br />The special effects worked because I felt I vicariously lived through Spider-Man as he spun his webs and swung across the canyons of New York City.  It made my vertigo kick in.  However, in certain scenes, Spider-Man appeared slightly too cartoonish and failed to blend into his non-computer generated surroundings.  The final scene of the film illustrates my point.  <BR> <BR>Tobey Maguire proved to be a brilliant casting coup.  He perfectly captured the quirky nerdiness of the teenage Peter Parker.  After being bitten by a genetically engineered spider, Peter Parker wakes up the next day and discovers his new gifts; he at first, merely uses his powers for personal gain and does what any teen would do.  He enters a wrestling competition to earn $3000 to buy a car to impress the object of his desire, Mary Jane Watson, played effectively by Kirsten Dunst.  <BR> <BR>Willem Defoe must have relished playing the dual role of Norman Osbourne and the Green Goblin.  Upon drinking the enhancement serum, his personality is split.  Defoe plays Osbourne's manic side to perfection.  Director Sam Raimi utilized adroit editing to depict the simultaneous evolution of Peter Parker and Norman Osbourne.  Defoe's a fine actor and proves it once again here with his villainous turn.  He'll go down in the comic book movie villain hall of fame with Gene Hackman (Lex Luthor) and Jack Nicholson (the Joker).  <BR> <BR>Supporting characters, J.K. Simmons and James Franco gave phenomenal performances as J.J. Jameson and Harry Osbourne respectively.  Simmons was hysterical and we can only hope his screen time is increased in the eventual sequel.  Franco's performance reflected the mild jealousy he had of Peter Parker because Parker gained his father's admiration.   <BR> <BR>Spider-Man received an appropriate PG-13 rating because there were some scenes involving the Green Goblin that might be too scary for young children.  Composer Danny Elfman's score for Spider-Man proved to be the most unremarkable thing about the film.  I couldn't remember a note of it as I walked into my car in the parking lot immediately upon viewing the film.  Could anyone say that about John Williams's score for Superman?  I think not.  The \\"Don't mess with New Yorkers,\\" dialog near the climactic fight atop the Queensborough Bridge made me wince and cover my face.  Such a blatant display of political rectitude in the wake of the September 11th tragedy should have been left on the cutting room floor.  <BR> <BR>Spider-Man ranks behind the first Superman film as the best comic book adaptation ever made.  It's genuine fun.  The thrilling actions sequences will quench the thirst of the summer moviegoer parched for excitement.
B000001FFJ|5.0|The many five star reviews coupled with a few &quot;oh my gawd, this is, like, music?&quot; ones really tells the whole story.  This is the work of a musical genius.  If you are afraid of experimentation and diversity or are looking for a &quot;rock&quot; or &quot;pop&quot; album, you'd do well to go elsewhere.  Let's be clear about one thing though, this is not the kind of experimentation aimed at being ponderous or insulting to the intelligence of the listener.  This is the kind of experimentation aimed at making compelling music...and it does.
0140380221|5.0|I'm a fanatic fan of Little Women. This book is wonderful beyond words. I just cannot put it down. It has humour and warmth writtn into it. A Great book. Really a must-read. If there was a 6 stars mark i would have given it to Little Women:)
B00005UKKF|5.0|We all know Britney can dance. We all know Britney can make excellent videos, and we all know she can't sing that well live, but it does not matter because the one thing Britney can do is put on an incredible show. Britneys at her best on her Dream Within a Dream Live From Vegas tour. From the opening Oops...I Did It Again she will have you hooked as she performs each and everyone of her hits. The choreography, staging, costumes, and special affects are breathtaking. I do widh she would sing live, but then a part of me doesn't. Its not about what she sounds like or even the songs themselves, its the perfect performance of them that matters. She is an entertainer and she soars at entertaining. Highlights include the funky Boys, Overprotected, and What Its Like To Be Me, The finale of Baby One More Time is the most sexually charged performance with Britney getting drenched as rain pours down on the stage. If anyone has not seen Britney live than you all must, but this concert will do just fine for the time being.
B00003CX5P|4.0|I remember the first time I saw \\"Star Wars-Episode I: The Phantom Menace\\". I was so impressed -with my mouth wide open -by the visual effects that I forgot the rest of the movie. The CGI effects marked a breakthrough so high that I didn't pay attention to the characters. When I came out of the cinema, I asked myself \\"Was I really watching this movie?\\"<br />In a video documentary called \\"From Star Wars To Jedi: The Making Of A Saga\\", George Lucas said: 'Special effects are a tool, means of telling a story. Special effects without a story is a pretty boring thing'. Well, in my opinion, it seems he contradicted himself while filming \\"The Phantom Menace\\" because the movie almost became boring thanks to those spectacular, yet excessive, visual effects. He seemed to have forgotten how to direct his actors, especially Jake Lloyd, and the story fell down to a great second place. The Force appears to be no longer with Lucas.<br />However, I must admit that this DVD is fantastic. I mean the extras are truly superb. The documentary, that tells the process that Lucas and his team went through in making this film, is excellent; like a video journal on the production development. The deleted scenes are great, especially the one in which Qui-Gon Jinn (Liam Neeson), Obi-Wan Kenobi (Ewan MacGregor), and Jar-Jar Binks escape from the Gungan transport before it falls down a waterfall. I mean all the extras are worthwhile.<br />It's too bad that I only have to give this DVD four stars in spite of its quality, but the movie itself refrains me from giving it five. Honest.
0767819446|4.0|It seems that many have compared this film to 'The Matrix'. I don't think that this is very valid as the actors in 'The Thirteenth Floor' earned less money and performed better. The special effects were more subtle than the crash, bang, wallop of 'The Matrix', and it seems from the other reviews published here that the the plot was a little too complex for the average viewer, so they have dealt with that by writing that it was lacking in story. This is far from the truth. The plotline sets those who can to think.  <br />I feel confident that it will become a cult classic with time as more see and appreciate it.
B00003CXXP|3.0|...but, alas, I could not. The touch of The Master, Stanley Kubrick, is visible, but his delicate, cold but perfect imprint is smeared into a Spielbergian happy-face. The first of the films' three acts is the best, showing the impact of an artificial boy ('mecha') on a couple whose own child was taken from them by illness and lies in a (supposedly) irrevocable coma. The mecha, played brilliantly by Haley Joel Osment, is capable of loving whomever it imprints on if a series of code-words are spoken. The couple agonize over the idea, repelled then compelled by the notion of a loving machine/child. Spielberg shows admirable restraint, allowing the cast to bring this conflict out at pace through sometimes humorous, often disturbing vignettes. Eventually, the couple decides to &quot;activate&quot; the &quot;love program&quot; (for lack of a better term), knowing full well that the process is irreversible - a mecha who imprints can only love the one it imprints on. Should the imprint-ee change his or her mind later, the mecha must be destroyed or face a lifetime of torment over not being loved in return. This conflict drives the last two-thirds of the film, because - guess what - mom and dad change their minds. To their credit, it appears that they have good reasons, but the scene in which the mecha fully realizes he is being rejected is one of the most wrenching I have ever seen. Osment should have received an Oscar for his performance. Osment goes on a quest to find his mother and get her to love him. The simple directness of his need takes him through various places and events designed to reflect various human traits and needs - violence, lust and fantasy. He will not, of course, be distracted by these. Osments' mecha is perfect in love as no human can be, pursuing that most precious (and obsessively singular) thing to the end. Literally. The last two thirds of the film show a steady lightening of tone from Kubrickian to Spielbergian. This is not necessarily bad, but Spielbergs' optimism about human nature can sometimes lead to saccharine excess and easy resolution. It is difficult to explain my ultimate disappointment in the film without spoilers, so suffice to say humanity gets let off the hook for deserting this wonderful loving creation and the mecha gets a happy ending of sorts. Prior viewers of the film should ask themselves - how much more poignant would the film be if it ended with the discovery of the Blue Fairy and the prayer of a little boy?
B00005JKBC|4.0|What a great mind twisting movie.  While Robert Redford and Brad Pitt's characters run the gamut of teacher-student to friends to former friends they still understand what each other is all about.  As the movie moves into its final stages and the cloak and dagger picks up it becomes even more engrossing.  This is a move, somewhat, in the vein of &quot;Sneaker&quot; with the little, individual agent, running against the grain of the agency.  <br />A very good movie, recommended to anyone who likes the double cross, triple cross type suprise or the little man outsmarting the big arrogant man.  <br />Buy it - view it - enjoy it.
B0000025DV|5.0|This album, along with A New World Record and Face The Music, are essentials in the ELO catalogue<br />Out of The Blue flows very well from one song to another and shows ELO at the pinnacle of creativity (particularly Jeff Lynne). <br />This fact can be why some songs are considered filler tunes.  I personally love the album as a whole, but if I'd have to pick songs to leave off they'd be most of side 2 actually (the last half from Jungle on), The Whale, and Wild West Hero.  I just feel they are a little weaker than the other songs on the album (maybe even Mr. Blue Sky).  <br />But as I said before, it is great the way it is.  That's what makes it a good album. <br />One more note : The production of this album is supremeo! Bravo to Jeff Lynne and associates!<br />Worth the money for a cool trip!<br />A+
B000002699|5.0|Sweet, sublime, this is a classic. The kind of blue of it's generation. This music is timeless. Heavily edited from the recording sessions, producer Teo Macero's inspired editing also has alot to do with the quality of this album.
0553579908|5.0|George R.R. Martin is easily my favorite author. \\"A Clash of Kings\\" blows almost every book that I've read out of the water because Martin is such an awesome author. This is the second book in the series titled \\"A Song of Ice and Fire\\" and picks up right after the first book in the series. This novel starts off with a very riveting prologue and then takes us back to our favorite characters and the events that are taking place. <br /> If you haven't read the first book in this series then you may not understand the plot. If this is the case, go to the page for \\"A Game of Thrones\\" and you will be familiar with this series. This book picks up after book one and continues the story that started in the first book. Stannis Baratheon, Renly Baratheon, Joffrey Baratheon, and Robb Stark are naming themselves the king of Westeros and war has started. This book has a lot of fighting, political intrigue, wonderful characterisation, suspense, and an awesome storyline. Martin really starts to kill off certain characters in this book and the people being killed will be the people that you would think the least of. By the end of this book many things will have changed from the beginning and you will be shocked by the events that took place.<br /> With this book comes more magical things than what was in the first book. Many magical doings take place and are major to the plot. There are no quests and most of this book is based on sword fighting, politics, and a captivating storyline. These things make for a refreshing break from the usual fantasy that you see today. <br /> What makes \\"A Clash of Kings\\" interesting, and the other two novels in this series for that matter, is the way that the story is told. The story is broken up into chapters told from the point of view of the main characters and because of this you are not stuck with the point of view of one character throughout the whole entire story. In adiition to the characters that survived in \\"A Game of Thrones\\" there are twonew characters whose points of views are told. Read this book to see who the new two people are.<br /> For those of you who think that no other book can beat \\"A Game of Thrones,\\" you're wrong. \\"A Clash of Kings\\" is only better than the first book because the plot develops more and thickens, you'll become much closer the the characters, and George R.R. Martin writes brilliantly. This book should only be read if you have read the first novel in this series. If I were you, I would order both books 2 and 3 of \\"A Song of Ice and Fire\\" (asuuming that you've read book 1) because when you are done with this book you are going to want to dive right into book 3. This book is a new type of fantasy novel and should not be missed by any fan of the genre. This book will do everything BUT disappoint.<br />Happy Reading!
B00003CXXP|5.0|For those of you expecting a \\"cute, sweet\\" Speilberg movie, like E.T. or Hook, then buy them.  This is not that type of movie.  The worst thing Dreamworks ever did was market this movie as a story of a little boy robot who dreams of being real.  \\"His love is real, but he is not.\\" Sounds cute, doesn't it?  Well, it's not.<br />I'm sorry to disappoint fans of E.T. and Indiana Jones, but directors grow (shudder!) as persons and in their craft.  A.I. is not an incoherent mess, but a conglomerate of a story, a fable, and a moral lesson.  The story is divided into three distinct sections (any mature, smart audience member will be able to see that): 1)The beginning of David, the \\"mecha,\\" who is brought into a family to replace the son who is in a coma, 2) the journey of David, after he is thrown out by the family, and his desire to find The Blue Fairy who can turn him into a real boy (he had been read the story by his \\"mother\\"), and 3) the end of David.  <br />Speilberg shows us the dark side of the future, and raises interesting moral questions.  If we can create something so life-like, can we become so attached to it that we cannot destroy it?  Is it humane to destroy these \\"mechas?\\"  Where do we stop?  It mirrors the current debate over cloning.  For every person who creates, there must be one who destroys, and Speilberg is not afraid to show this.  This is Speilberg's darkest film to date, but it is also his most moving, in my opinion.  And it is also spotted with Kubrick's influence as well.  It is Speilberg channeling Kubrick channeling Speilberg and it pays off.<br />While the subject matter is not inappropriate for children, it is likely that children (and, from reading some reviews, some adults) will not understand this picture.  This is one of the most intriguing, brave, intelligent, and beautiful films of the year.  The visions of New York City covered by the ocean and ice is particularly chilling.  Brilliant, just brilliant!  And the extras are a perfect companion to the film.  I simply wish A.I. had gotten the credit it deserves.
B00000ILDF|3.0|... than he gets for this film. Yah, it has its flaws, but it is a really good example of Fincher-as-stylist. This film brings Lieutenant Ripley to a confined warren of tunnels on a remote prison planet where there are few people, no weapons and the only prospect of escape is a ship sent by &quot;the Company&quot; to &quot;rescue&quot; those who can live long enough. Fincher tries to do several things: he wants to get back to the confined, dread-full environment that made the first Alien film such a nail-biter (check); he wants to give the audience a newfangled Alien (check); he wants to give us characters to care about (check); he wants to bring back the incredible suspense of the original (ummm... well, no); he wants to make an action film (well, ummm... no again). The major flaw in this film is that it took the moody ambience of the first film and tried to inject the adrenaline of the second. As a result, the film builds suspense up until the killing starts, then rushes too fast through to the end. There are probably four times the number of characters in this film as the original, and still only one alien, and yet by the end of the film, we are almost out of survivors to root for. There are too many characters for the audience to get to know, and Fincher kills them off en masse - literally. This time-compressed high-body-count ruins the suspense that had been building and makes the creepy, grungy, industrial-decay setting irrelevant. This is literally the only thing wrong with this film - although it is enough. Fans and critics savaged this film, but truly, this was a good attempt to make a suspenseful film with strong characterization. I suspect someone on the production staff forced Fincher to inject more action into it, thereby killing the mood. All complaints aside, this is still definitely rental material. For fans, go with Alien first, then Aliens. This one is third best as well as number three of the series. Alien Resurrection - don't even get me started.It makes this one look great.
B00003CXTG|2.0|The attack and battle scenes in this movie were very good.  But other than that it had little to offer.  The sub-plot of the love story was weak and predictable.  I was dissappointed in the movie as a whole.  I felt that there was a lot of promise to this movie that for some reason was not fulfilled.  <br />It seems as though some people really liked this movie but that was not my opinion.  My advice, I would view it first and decide before buying.  A mistake I made was to buy before viewing based on information I had heard from friends.  I was sorry I did not rent it first.
B0000025DT|5.0|This has to be the best ELO CD I've heard.  I've loved this album ever since I was little (about 5 or 6), and still love it.<br />Like other reviewers have noted, there is not a weak track on the whole album!  I only wish it were longer (although maybe the risk of a few filler tracks would increase - take a look at Out of the Blue).<br />Elo classics include: Telephone Line, Livin' Thing, Do Ya, and Rockaria. And there are great album tracks as well: Tightrope, So Fine, Mission (A New World Record)  Above The Clouds reminds me of a \\"Pet Sounds\\" era song the Beach Boys would have done.<br />One of my favorite albums of the '70s  <br />Get it ---- A++ All the Way!!!
0716703440|5.0|I used the first 11 chapters as an introduction to differential geometry and, after translating the math into my own notation, found this source to be the best available, hands down. The authors use the mathematicians' notation, labeling infinitesimal generators as tangent vectors, a notation that I personally find to be annoying. This is nearly the only readable source, in English, of Cartan's (after the fact) observation that Newtonian gravitational orbits are (limit of GR with G fixed as c goes to infinity) geodesics in space-time, with the curvature in the (x,t), (y,t) and (z,t) subspaces, with space Euclidean and time absolute. Beautiful!
0743420373|4.0|this book makes me think twice about the way that i spend money.  It also makes me want to try harder to save money and not want to spend money on &quot;luxurious&quot; things, at all.  This book shows us all a completely different view of millionaires, especially those who go against the &quot;norm&quot;.  The people in this book live very plain lives and do what they can to gain wealth.  They live below their means and save what money they can as they can do it.  These people also don't live luxurious lives because to them it seems to be a waste.  This makes me think twice about how I spend my own money and also about how I think about the people I see.
B000001ESP|5.0|&quot;Moving Pictures&quot; is the perfect marriage of accessibility and intellect.  With such classics as &quot;Tom Sawyer&quot; and &quot;Limelight&quot;, you're sure to hear a familiar riff or two upon popping this album in.  What gives Rush songs such staying power, however, is the pure talent.  Instead of just a big riff and showy vocals (the only things bands like AC DC ever really had to offer), Rush creates an entire soundscape, full of complex rhythms and great textures.  The fact that I (primarly and emo/post hardcore fan) can not only enjoy, but also rock out to, these songs 20 years after they came out says a lot about Rush's capability as songwriters.  This is hard rock for the thinkers and those that just enjoy exciting music.  Looking at some of the more exciting bands of the last decade, such as Sunny Day Real Estate, and seeing how much they owe directly to Rush is a true testament to their talent, and this album probably shows them at their peak.
B00003CY0V|2.0|Jackman is the new Clint Eastwood but I fear that the film making talent just isn't there to give him his own iconic 'Dirty Harry', an affliction troubling many up and coming Hollywood stars today. His look of bewilderment and horror at the surreal nightmare he's trapped in during the robbery burns itself on your memory. Unfortunately, his subsequent willingness to except his cut of the appalling enterprise which cost the lives of innocent hostages disappoints and disgusts, even if he has a child to support in this barely watchable and frequently ugly would-be satirical examination of 'the ends justify the means'.
B0000009OX|5.0|They really are the Irish Ramones.  Great classic rock. Teenage Kicks is a great song.
0743420373|5.0|I really enjoyed reading this book. It felt like I was behind the scenes of a very well kept secret - who the &quot;real&quot; millionaires are. The tables in the book help visualize the facts, and the personal letter excerpts give insight into the mentality of others about finances.  The well researched facts definitely cleared up the false image of the &quot;American millionaire&quot; I had painted in my head. Now I will definitely exercise budgeting and set aside 15% of my paycheck for personal spending. The how-to techniques in this book have motivated me to take control of my finances.  It has layed the foundation for smart thinking and exposed the discipline required in moderate spending.
B000002KIE|5.0|WOW!! This is one of the most amazing album I own. Sex Pistols was a GREAT band! Johnny has a terrific voice, so... funny!! Yes, songs are rude (cool!) and the sound quality is not like modern CDs but I found them very interesting; I think that the Pistols were really talented to do what they did. THANK YOU! My fav is song is E.M.I...
B000001ES9|5.0|The origins of a band can be ascertained from their debut album. This album is hard, fast, fun living. This is *real* Rush. If you like early Boston but with a bit of heat, then this is an album for your collection.
B0000541AM|3.0|Comes across as rather sweet, now. Could be a PG, really. Self parodic at the time, there are a few extra laughs now. Rather plodding by today's standards but has a certain magic that's hard to quantify. <BR>In the big beach stand off, how did Rembrandt and the cowboy avoid being shot when Swan stepped out of the path of that bullet fired by Luther? They're not rabbit droppings, you know.
B00005BJ2O|5.0|I think that this movie was: Spectacular Spectacular, It's nothing short of Nacular and it's So exciting The Audiance won't stop it's cheer So delighting It will run for fifty years! This Movie rocks almost as much as the Soundtrack does!
B00005JKCF|5.0|This is the best movie of 2002 so far.  It was fun and exciting.  Maguire and Dunst give great performances, and the ending is superb.  Thank goodness they have these two signed on for two more films.<br />You will not be disappointed by the story or the acting.  Go see this movie.  In fcat, go see it twice.  There are things you'll miss the first time that will blow you away.
B00004Z459|4.0|When I perchased linkin parks first CD in 2000, I had absolutley no idea that they would be the bestselling band of 2001. Selling over 4.8 million copies, this was a shocker of both good and bad. Good being that rock has topped the charts, but bad in considering in 1998-1999 the best selling CD was 10 million or more. This is an example of how corporate the music biz is. We are lucky to have to recieved a band like Linkin Park, as they fight for the same cause as I. And that is to put those corporate [persons] in thier places.I rated this album a 4 because the genere is not new, but they seem to bleed anti-corporate plus they are just paving the way for thier second effort. I expected this band to sound  like every bit of limp bizkit, but \\"Papercut\\", \\"With You\\" and \\"Four Points of Authority\\" proved me wrong. These tracks alone is worth the now 13 (I paid 7) bucks. They may have the rap with guitar sound, but Chester can join Nsync anytime and Mike can actually rap. Also they bring a new sound with the tripling of the voices and better guitar work. Almost like a cross between Deftones and and a cool rapper. Joe Hahn and the others are very talented too. They make me proud because they are representing my home (and making it look good). And now that the world knows thier second album is ready to be released soon, we cant be expectant of anything they're going to bring to the table. We all must Prepare.
B00005OWEG|1.0|Judging by this, the original film was salvaged from even more dire material. The former was an insult to both sides who fought in the war. As if a US Colonel would put his men in danger like that. Piffle. As for Kurtz, the reality was more along the lines of Colonel Norman Schwarzkopf, who according to his autobiography was so appalled by the way a unit he was posted to was run, lined up his men and sacked the incompetent leader in front of them and spent the rest of the war trying to improve matters. He didn't go and sit in the jungle like Kurtz and mumble a lot of existential angst.<BR>'Redux' boasts a truly bizarre scene involving Bunnies. Obviously, the director was making a 'statement' dear to his heart and absurdly irrelevent to the real conflict. Needless to say the film is about American pain with the indigenous population mostly featureless.<BR>A potentially interesting scene with some French colonials is rendered incomprehensible by rapid exposition and heavy accents. The gist of it was that the VC were something of an American Frankenstien monster. Despite the French patriarch's flattering description of the VC as intelligent, the film undermines this with some zombified natives willing to lay down their weapons on the whim of an American, regardless of the political issues at stake, because the director wants to make another statement dear to his heart. The self righteous disgust of the American in question somewhat undermined by all that carpet bombing.<br />'Apocalypse Now' has been voted into the top 100 best films ever made presumably by people to whom thinking is no doubt an optional extra.
B0000009SI|5.0|This is a great album... Musically, it's amazing and atmospheric, and lyrically it's funny and very unique.  Zappa did all kinds of music, from experimental to intelligent social parodies... This one is very jazzy, and the lyrics range from parodies of [phony] psychics to bathroom humor... It starts out as a concept album, then shifts to some random songs.  Here's what I think of each song:<br />Don't Eat the Yellow Snow:  Short, but sweet song that starts the story of Nanook the eskimo.  Great song, funny and great to listen to.<br />Nanook Rubs it:  Nanook gets into a conflict with a fur trapper, who jumps from behind an igloo, and starts whippin' on his favorite baby seal... They both end up blinded, and it causes the fur trapper to go up to Saint Alfonzo to help his eyes.  Great jazz-rock song, with great vocals and instrumental work.<br />St. Alfonzo's Pancake Breakfast:  This one speeds it up, and is actually pretty catchy.  I like it quite a bit, funny and great listening.<br />Father O'Blivion:  Another faster song, it's great and quirky... The last song that stays as a concept album. (I think, it's a bit of a blurry concept album) *sigh* No others like Zappa... <br />Cosmik Debris:  Wonderful, great song, one of my favorites.  It makes fun of phony psychics, and the like.  It's very funny, and musically it's very catchy and cool.  \\"I wrapped a newspaper round my head, so I'd look like I was deep. I said some mumbojumbos then,  and I told him he was going to sleep.  I robbed his rings and pocket watch and every thing else I found. I had that[guy]hypnotized, he couldn't even make a sound. I proceeded to tell him his future then.  As long as he was hanging around, I said, 'The price of meat has just gone up and your old lady has just gone down.'\\"<br />Excentrifugal Forz:  My least favorite on the album, it's still a good song.<br />Apostrophe:  This is one of Zappa's less complex and interesting instrumentals, but still worth a listen.  However, this album isn't an instrumental classic. (for great instrumentals, try Yellow Shark, Hot Rats or The Grand Wazoo)<br />Uncle Remus:  Flowing, nice little song, with cultural awareness.  Very good, nice piano music too.<br />Stinkfoot:  Heh, funny, quirky and great jazz song about the dreaded... STINKFOOT!  Another favorite of mine, I like this one a lot.<br />Oh, no one was like Zappa...  Great album, I recommend it to newer Zappa fans, because it's easier to digest than some of his explicit stuff, and some of his surreal, insane music.  To others... Well, the open-minded jazz fans will like it, but for casual pop fans... no.
B00004Z459|5.0|Dont listen to the [people] in the beginning and the ones that gave low ratings.  This cd definately defines what rock is.  All the songs are good, I can listen to it over 'n over and never get bored.  I really reccommend getting this cd and dont listen to all those other ... reviews.
0671042858|3.0|...P>Trisha McFarland, a clever nine-year old with incredible wit and character, has enough of her family while on a six-mile hike on the Maine-New Hampshire branch of the Appalachian Trail, and decides to take her own path.  But as she wanders off by her herself and then attempts to use a shortcut to return to her mother and brother, she becomes lost in the dark, mysterious wilderness.  While on her quest back to safety, Trisha uses the comfort of her radio, which she uses to listen to the Red Sox and her favorite player--closer Tom Gordon.  When the radio's reception fades, she uses Gordon as her guide away from a terrifying enemy that lurks in the woods.  Not one of King's most exciting works, but at only 264 pages, it is fortunately a quick read.  Trisha is a well-developed character who has many levels to her, but ultimately her love for baseball and God is what carries her presence through the novel.  Having a love for baseball (and even Tom Gordon) is not a prerequisite, but it certainly helps.  A good tale of courage, innocence, and love for the game.
B00003CY5J|3.0|Good old fashioned caper flick with the always welcome Ed Norton. The kindness and consideration shown to Norton by his workmates and it's subsequent betrayal, probably negating the employment prospects of person with a genuine disability, ultimately makes the film a hard sell in regards to your long term affections.<BR>Brando still commands attention in a dandy performance although he not only appears to have mothballs in his mouth this time around but the moths as well. Attaboy, Marlon, and give the little perishers an extra chomp for me.
B000002C1V|4.0|This was the last Roger Waters-controlled Pink Floyd album, and it's a great end for him.  The lyrics are the best Pink Floyd lyrics since Animals, but musically, it's quite a bit like The Wall.  Some of the songs travel far from The Wall, still, and are very different from other Floyd material.  The lyrics are truly sad, but incredibly powerful, and we get to see what Waters thinks of war, and his father's death.  It's a great anti-war album, and not many albums reach the meaning behind this one.  Waters has great vocals, too, and his voice works perfectly for the sometimes angry, sometimes sad, and sometimes wise lyrics.  It isn't as many Pink Floyd, but still great.  Very different, and very brilliant.  After this, Pink Floyd began to deteriate.  After Waters, Floyd was no more... This is the last great P.F album, IMHO...  <br />Recommended, but not as a very first for early Floyd fans.
B00005R2M3|5.0|When I first saw Shakira's video for Whenever Wherever I knew she would be something special. The video was great and the song was amazing as well. I really liked the first two singles of Shakira's released. Whenever Wherever, an up-beat lively song and Underneath You Clothes, a slower, calmer song, are two of the best on this CD. Once you listen to this CD a few times, you'll really like it. Laundry Service includes a variety of upbeat songs, dance songs, and songs about love. The lyrics are great and usually pretty funny. Unlike Britney Spears, Shakira is very talented and her music is written by talented people including the song &quot;Eyes Like Yours&quot; which is written by Gloria Estefan. &quot;Fool&quot; is another great song with great guitars and vocals. &quot;Fool&quot; is song that you can easily relate to.<br />If you are looking for a great CD form a GREAT singer, go out and get Shakira's debut album Laundry Service. You'll be glad you did!
B00005QZ7U|2.0|This movie is bizarre and hard to follow.
B00005RHGK|3.0|Arguably, the best thriller since 'Halloween'. Direction is often inspired - a torch illuminating something for the audience that the protaganist cannot see, the out of focus approach of lights unnoticed by another. Other times crass, such as the discovery of the rifled laundry at the diner. The stop-start nature of the action coupled with a plot revolving around a foregone conclusion prevents a head of steam from truly building, but yields other quirky rewards especially in the mordant humour. The background of the director gives this occasionally terrifying film a nasty edge that makes me feel guilty for liking it.<BR>The original ending is included as an extra, and is to my mind subtler and more terrifying than the more explicit ending we eventually arrived at. Perhaps, rather patronisingly, they didn't think the audience would 'get it'.
B00005JKDR|4.0|Monsters, Inc. is a great movie for the young and the old. It shows us the other side if the monster not the one we are all scared of.It helps understand the meaning of friendship, how two totally different speices can get along.Two of the main characters shows us that a friend is a friend in good or bad times. Is amazing how frienship conqueres all.

B00005V3Z4|5.0|This movie manages to be thought-provoking and hilarious at the same time. It's just the greatest thing ever. I had given up on finding good movies until I rented this treasure...
B000005JA8|5.0|I bought this album because every critic that I respect loved it.  I bought it and was blown away by how awful it sounded.  The music sounded all messed up and the vocals were really bad.  I thought I would give it a couple more spins, but not till I had recovered from the first experience.  About a month later I played it again....wow it was amazing.  Everything appeared to make sense after the second time around and I really enjoyed it.  It is one of those things that simply isn't for everybody.  If you like it than consider yourself a special being, if you hate it then don't worry about it, probably 99.9% of other people do. I am just surprised that the album gets a 4.5 star rating.  I figured it would get either 5 since no one really knows or cares about it, or 3-3.5 because some people would check it out and automatically give it 1 star.  Oh an just so you know, this whole album is like one big mistake.  Beefheart wrote all the songs on piano, which he couldn't play, and he wrote all 28 songs in 9 hours.  They spent not only a year practicing the music, but a good portion of that year transcribing the music from Beefheart's crazy piano parts to guitar, drum, and bass.  It took forever because he wrote parts of the music in different meters and time signatures.  People who don't think that the people playing the music had talent are truly not intelligent.  They had to practice it for a year because it was some of the hardest music ever to play in rock history.  It is like every person playing their part is doing something entirely different than the next.  Oh and to top it off when Beefheart recorded his vocal tracks, he didn't wear his headphones, so he never sings along with the music, which I guess really didn't matter since the music was so screwed up anyway.  Oh well, some genius will never be fully appreciated.  Beefheart is by far the weirdest guy ever to make music and I think he always will be.
0812550706|5.0|A friend of mine gave me this book to read.  I was hesitant at first because I have read many a disappointing sci-fi novels.  I've found that many of them get caught up in the image and ideas of the future and the technology and tend to ignore the characters.  But \\"Enders Game\\" was different.  I loved this book.  I truly cared about Ender and the people around him.  What a great story.  I highly recommend it!!!!  ...
6304169558|4.0|Even if the melodramatics and the dialogue are contrived, TWISTER is still one of the best of the latter-day disaster films.  Much more realistic than a volcano turning L.A. into lava (VOLCANO) or a gung-ho uprising against evil aliens (INDEPENDECE DAY), the subject at the center of this 1996 sci-fi/disaster movie is one of the deadliest manifestations of nature--the tornado.<br />Helen Hunt and Bill Paxton portray scientists who, though they are on the edge of divorcing, are soonthrown back together when extremely violent storms form on the eastern fringe of the Rockies and soon sweep into the Midwest, an area known as \\"Tornado Alley.\\"  Paxton looks upon it as a science, but Hunt is much more obsessive about it; she has been ever since a twister in June 1969 killed her father.  Caught up in this whole tornado business is Paxton's intended next wife (Jami Gertz).<br />Competing with a former partner (Cary Elwes) of theirs whom Paxton refers to as a \\"night crawler\\", Hunt and Paxton continually try to get their new tornado mapping device they call \\"Dorothy\\" (inspired by THE WIZARD OF OZ) into the heart of one of these dark and deadly storms.  They finally manage to do it with a monster twister measuring a mile wide at the base, but they nearly become casualties of that monster.<br />Despite the contrivances, TWISTER works because of the fine performances of Hunt and Paxton, who work good together even when they're bickering.  The film itself has a very kinetic, suspenseful, and downright frightening quality to it, thanks in large part to the direction of Jan DeBont (SPEED) and the realistic premise of the screenplay by Michael Crichton (JURASSIC PARK; WESTWORLD) and his wife Anne-Marie Martin.  The tornado effects, including the flying cow, the runaway debris, and the fuel tanker, are all quite hair-raising.<br />This is about as realistic a disaster film as there has been since the grand-daddy of all disaster films, Irwin Allen's 1974 epic THE TOWERING INFERNO.  It may not be an unflawed film, but it's definitely better than average.
B0000028M7|5.0|Firstly, can I say yet again that AiC were never a grunge band! Hell, grunge was a buzz word which won't be missed.<br />This album is simply put, mind blowing. If you want an extremely dark album, then this will satisfy that need. It sadly now reads like an obituary for Stayley (RIP). AiC were one of the best bands of the last decade and this was there crowning moment. Heavy, dark, emotional and something that the current crop of imitators will never achieve.<br />The great thing about AiC albums is every one is very very very different. If you haven't heard this album, then why not? I'd also suggest picking up the Jar of Flies EP along with this as the two perfectly compliment each other. You have the complete overload that is Dirt, then the more acoustic slow soothing and equally dark Jar of Flies.<br />Forget Puddle of whatever or \\"God Smack\\" (original name) or Creed. This is the band that started it all and ultimately, this is the band that will never be bettered by those desperate to do so.
B000002LRX|3.0|This album reeks of pretentiousness.  They played it a little too seriously.  I like Patton better when he's just having a good time, as on Mr. Bungle's albums.  He's a lot more cheerful and upbeat there and his goofier, more humorous side comes out.  This one's too much doom and gloom for me.
B00005NI5Y|5.0|We expect so much of Dylan, probably way too much at times.  That's what makes this album among the most amazing he (or anyone) has ever done.  We are listening to a contemparory Blonde on Blonde, Highway 61, or Blood on the Tracks.  This album is their equal.  Who else could make an album like this?  Nobody.  This is an album where a 5 star review actually is legitimate.  Music doesn't get any better than this, and this album will be listened to by our children's children, it's that good and that much of a classic.
0345448898|5.0|These books have changed my life.  Having extensively studied theology, philosophy of Religion and many eastern religions I had found myself coming to my own conclusions about religion, life, the universe and everything.<br />These books will make you question your faith.  I am the stronger for it and have finally consigned my church upbringing as an anachronism.  Christianity IS a convincing and powerful lie and it is time for us to move on.  So much of what the books say makes sense and I was amazed at seeing my own personal beliefs reflected in words so eloquently and persuasively.  Strong characterisation, dynamic plot, moving concepts, enlightening ideas.  If you are not changed by this you are not human, because these books are about what it is to be alive and conscious and independent.  BUY IT<br />No doubt it seriously offends the religious Right though, but what 'Authority' do they have?...
B00005TT77|1.0|Come on. If you're gonna do a Beatles cover, you should've traveled back into the 60 or 70s(maybe the 80s too). Some of the best Beatle remakes have come from damn good artists such as Earth, Wind, and Fire (Got to get you into my Life), Shirley Bassey (Something), and many more. It's as if the artist on this soundtrack played the Beatles records backwards and decided upon themselves to attempt to recreate their music. When I heard Strawberry Fields Forever, just after a few bars, I almost died. Ben Harper definitely was born yesterday. ONLY JOHN LENNON CAN DO STRAWBERRY FIELDS FOREVER!!!!AND NO ONE ELSE....NOT EVEN BRITNEY SPEARS!!!!!The rest of this so-called cover album consist of mostly John and Paul songs. I guess George Harrison is invisible even on this album. The Beatles have THAT certain \\"something\\" when it came to music. When someone is incapable of doing justice to any of their songs, one would think that the artist would be smart enough to stay away from it. But for some reason UNKNOWN, we are treated to this dreaded soundtrack, which comes as being twice as [bad] as the movie's title character (Sam). My suggestion, buy the real McCoys....and just be thankful that \\"The Continuing Story of Bungalow Bill\\" wasn't butchered.
0425152251|5.0|It is very easy to find fault with this book, especially if you are a philosopher.  Indeed, Philosopher's like finding fault with things, especially Deconstructionist Philosophers like Derrida - who complicate everything.<br />Some critics have said that this book fails as a novel but succeeds as an introduction to Philosophy.  Another critic has said that, &quot;In fact the book is not an introduction to philosophy at all but an introduction to the author's take on various philosophers, which is a very different thing.&quot;  I'm simply going to say that this book was a fun exploration of Philosophy, and the fact that Gardener's view permeate the text made it that much more enjoyable.<br />The book is not a complete history of philosophy, because many important thinkers and genres were left out.  Nor is the book a &quot;true&quot; history of Philosophy, because such a history does not exist.  As we all know, there are a variety of historical perspectives, and we see these from Copleston to Russell.  All histories of Philosophy are injected with bias, opinions, and emphases characteristic of the author's personality and area of interest.  In fact, that is what makes many of those works interesting in their own right.<br />Take Hegel's Philosophy of History, for example.  Objectively speaking, it is perhaps the worst History of Philosophy every written, and yet his vision of an organic philosophical spirit moving through history is breath-taking.  Or take a Marxian history of Philosophy.  Almost all Marx-inspired histories focus on class at the expense of everything else, from ideas to race.  And yet for the Marxist, such histories are deemed important and true in the final sense of the word.<br />Therefore, I must assess Gardner in her own right.  For what she set out to accomplish and inspire, this book was a complete success.  Namely, if you are new to philosophy, this book will do exactly what any good philosophical primer should do:  It will pique your sense of wonder, while at the same time providing you with a fairly good introduction to Philosophy's most prominent thinkers.  If you happen to enjoy the teenage plot and its strange conclusion, so much the better.<br />Both Plato and Aristotle agreed that the origin of all Philosophy lies in wonder, and this book will provide the reader with a sense of philosophical wonder.  I can think of no better place to begin the long journey.sense of wonder, while at the same time providing you with a fairly good introduction to Philosophy's most prominent thinkers.

0783226063|5.0|i've watched this movie many times since i was a kid and have always loved it. it has a passion to it that the recent mini-series seriously lacked. the actors in this movie actually seemed excited about playing their parts, and showed true emotion. we knew that Leto was a heroic Duke by how he was acted. and so on. this movie does lack a lot of the political intrigue that the book spent a lot of time on, that that is where i fault the movie. but otherwise, it is excellent.
0060920432|1.0|I can honestly say that, my entire life has been a sort of search for a happy state of equilibrium, or \\"flow\\" as Csikszentmihaly puts it. According to Csikszen (for short), flow is more or less being a state of involvement with an an activity - work, sports, whatever - to the point where everything else it tuned out. Csikszen even goes so far as to say that this is in fact happiness.<br />I have various issues with this book. For one, it is boring. Csikszen's concept is flow is interesting for about five pages, and then it starts drag. Although expressing the concept through a variety of different stories and examples, monotonous redundancy quickly set in.<br />Secondly, Csikszen doesn't seem to achieve exellence in any department. This is neither a good self-help book nor a ground-breaking piece of science. And for all the psychology I have read, I would be hardpressed to label this psychology either. In any event, it is certainly not good psychology. It is just one overly simple view of what happiness is, expressed over and over again as Csikszen recounts the experiences of different sujects \\"flowing\\".<br />Finally, the book completely side-steps a real treatment of psychological neuroses. If you are unhappy because you suffer from serious issues that must be understood, contextualized and overcome, this is not the book for you. This book naively assumes that all problems vanish or are forgotten forever by focusing on the moment - and as far as the author is concerned, it doesn't matter what one focuses on. I picture a manic-depressive \\"flowing\\" on legos all day (my favorite form of flow).  The Kids in the Hall film, \\"Brain Candy,\\" quickly comes to mind.<br />This is a trifling book that is not worth your time. If you are interested in \\"flowing\\" in the first place, you need not read the book, because it will get you no closer to the immaculate \\"flow\\" experience. That said, if you are looking for ethically-charged, important, consequencial type of flow, seek out your local Buddhist organization. Indeed, \\"Flow\\" reads like a dry, watered-down, Westernized version of Zen Buddhism, for which it is no substitute.eek out your local Buddhist organization.

0441172717|3.0|I did not read this book before i saw the 1984 movie. that said, when i did actually read this book, i was riveted in a great socio-political conflict between two great houses and other parties involved. the story was wonderfully written and well worth the read for anyone who likes a good story. <br />my qualm with the book comes from the idea that this is a sci-fi book. beyond the names of the houses and the idea that this takes place on different planets, this story could have easily taken place in ancient rome. as a matter of fact while i read the book, my first thoughts were to rome. who knows, maybe it was because i had just watched gladiator before reading this book. but the point is that this book lacked much of anything sci-fi. and i was a bit bummed that Herbert didnt get into the details of the spaceships, how they travelled, the weaponry and everything else actually dealing with science. even the battle scenes themselves are brief, with most action coming from conversations and the intrigue going on. and i guess i'm getting picky now that i have been reading Robert Jordan's Wheel of Time, where he combines both political and social intrigue with some kick butt fighting scenes. that seems to be lacking in Dune, though the story is wonderfully written. that's why i give it only 3 stars.<br />PS: whatever you do, don't watch the Dune TV mini-series. stick to the original where a truly creative director helmed the show...
0312979479|4.0|This book was very exciting. It was an on the edge thriller that will keep you on the edge of your seat in suspense. The eleven characters were perfect for this format, you had the general which was the natural leader. The doctor who was always turned to tell the cause of death. The island itself was a perfect setting for this suspense thriller. Isolation and an awkwardly placed poem, completely finished off this top notch novel.
B00003CX5P|3.0|with Episode II just about out, i decided to finally write a quickie about Episode I. i've wanted to like this film, faithfully going to see it four times at theatres, buying the widescreen VHS edition when it came out--sold it since--and getting the really good DVD--also sold it since---but i just cant like this film. the story is just boring. it doesnt draw you in. i had just written a review of Mulholland Drive--which was superb---and what i wrote in that review is that i like movies that keep me riveted until the end. I just didn't feel drawn in into the conflicts in phantom menace and was bored, though the lightsaber scene near the end was pretty good. i give this DVD 3 stars only because the DVD is excellent. the hour-long documentary on the filming process is superb and may be worth getting this DVD....but not for the movie itself. I just hope and pray that lucas has done better with Episode II.
B00005YXZH|5.0|I bought Wilco's Summerteeth only because of information I had read about the band at BlueRodeo.com.  I was less than impressed.  Then EW ran a fabulous review of Yankee Hotel Foxtrot and I decided to try Wilco again.  Whoa!  I had to listen to the new album a few times to fully appreciate it, but this is one great album!  The songs are catchy, but demonstrate a maturity not often found in pop music.  I have recommended this album to friends and am recommending it here, as well.
B00003CXXJ|5.0|I think many people have already said great things about the movie. i just want to add my views on this DVD which is worth the money. it comes in two discs, one for widescreen lovers and the other for those who somehow just cant stand the black bars on the screen. too bad for them. the extras on this film are excellent as is the whole formatting.
B0000636UN|2.0|i've seen sheryl crow perform live before and she is a far more talented musician than is reflected in this record.  the best track is the one you're hearing constantly on the radio, which is a catchy but far from excellent song.  i had high expectations given some of the early reviews of the album and the collaborations with many artists i am fans of, but the much discussed duet with lenny falls short as do most of the other duets.  i think two stars is actually generous.  by way of comparison, this album pales in comparison to emmy lou harris' recent album, red dirt girl.
B00003CY0V|3.0|If you enjoy this genre of films then this is probably worth your time.  I saw it because I was interested in seeing more of Halle Berry's work with her new academy award status.  In this she proves she can play beautiful manipulative seductress very well.  It could have been a good movie- some of the plot ideas and charachter parallels were good- but the movie just didn't pull it off.  Baby-faced Travolta was hardly scary or awe inspiring as the evil agent promoting American values no matter the cost.  Whenever he tried to come off as demonically obsessed you almost thought you were watching a comedy.  If you are looking for a good action adventure that will completely blow you away, skip this.  If you've got an evening to kill and love this kind of stuff, see it.
B00005A46T|4.0|Lets get one thing straight... these guys aren't about \\"death metal\\" or heavy metal for that matter, it's something called NU-METAL. Just because their music is a bit heavy, doesn't mean they are death metal. <br />They guys are being constantly bashed by people saying... they are fake, gimmicky,  and they are Slayer wannabees, etc... <br />True, the masks/suits are a gimmick, but who the hell cares?? It's about the music, and it is very enjoyable. Just listen to \\"People = 4 stars\\" , \\"Left Behind\\" or \\"End of Everything\\".<br />The only problem I have with the band is their lyrics, which are just a little disturbing. But if you can enjoy the music and not the lyrics get to you, then your gonna love this cd.<br />I probably like this record just a LITTLE more then their previous one, simply because I generally like the music harder and louder. That being said, if you like that style of music as well, then definently buy this cd. Actually, I recommend getting the old album as well.<BR>Bottom line, if you want a straight up hard hitting, in-your-face album then get this CD...

Tracks like &quot;two dope boys&quot;, &quot;atliens&quot;, &quot;wheels of steel&quot;, &quot;elevators&quot;, &quot;jazzy Belle&quot; and &quot;millennium&quot; are some of the best Outkast tracks ever.

0385503954|5.0|I have read all of McEwan's books and this most recent writing is definitely his best. It is a masterpiece of fictional history that captures the times and events depicted with economy and distinction. His depiction of war is without equal in depth and lanscape. It is a page turner but also one that requires backing up from time to time to savour the rich writing.
B000002MP2|1.0|Legends?  You call these self-proclaimed stoner hacks legends?!  Sorry to break to ya, kid, but legends these guys ain't.  The reason why people say there's nary a bad song on the album is because it's just the same song every track, 14 times over.  The guitar player is one of the worst my ears have ever had the displeasure of hearing.  WHY can't he break up the monotony a bit by playing something besides the same repetitive notes every song?  Oh, I know, because he can't.  Anyway, it's very annoying, but forthright, proves he can't play well enough to make any of his own songs.  I suppose that's the worst of the album, and that's the most generous thing I can say about it.   <br />Thank You.<br />Want legends, try Nirvana.
B00005YXZH|5.0|After reading the reviews and waiting impatiently, I finally received and took a good listen. I am a Jeff Tweedy/Wilco/Uncle Tupelo/Sun Volt/Jay Farrar/Golden Smog/Mermaid Avenue fan.  It seems that at least from Summer Teeth and his work with Golden Smog - Weird Tales in particular, Jeff has been dabbling with Big Star influences.  Clearly this cd reverberates with Big Star Third musical themes.  If Sgt. Peppers is meant to be a euphemism for masterpiece than this may or not qualify - only time will tell that and many more listens - but if a comparison on a sound basis is to be made then this is Wilco's Big Star Third - difficult at times but well worth the investigation into the mysteries.
B00000JPH5|4.0|Okay, I gotta say right off the bat, that even though I am an avid python fan, that's not why I loved this film. (the script was written by Terry Jones)I have loved this movie ever since I was a little kid. My parents introduced it to me at a young age. I was riveted by the...interesting Goblins and the creepy-cool storyline about a girl who unknowingly gives up her baby brother to the Goblins. When she finds out what has happened, it is up to her to save her brother from the Goblin King. But it won't be easy. To stop her, the Goblin King (David Bowie) sets before her a challenge. If she solves the Labyrinth (A giant maze where there are basically no rules) in nine hours, she gets her brother back. If not...well, let's just say that the Goblins will have a new family member. You'll be absolutely amazed by this film. Watch it with the whole family, you won't be dissapointed.
0399220496|5.0|This is an amazing little book that children will LOVE. The Very Hungry Caterpillar is a story you can read over and over and cherish forever. In addition, the plush caterpillar that comes with the book helps little kids enjoy the story more.
0446608955|5.0|This is by far my favorite book! I LOVED it soooo much. I thought it was amazing story about your first love. That I think most everyone can relate to. If you are in Middle/High School you can relate to all the \\"groups\\" and images that everyone has of one another, but when opposites attract its a beautiful thing. If you are a bit older, most likely you know what it is to be in love for the first time. Of course, we all know what happens in the end...but still the memories and moments leading up to it were amazing. There were soo many scenes and moments where you are so caught up in the book, you DONT wanna let go! I recomend this book to everyone. Its such a moving and touching story. The last 50 pages will be done in one shot cause there is no physical way you can put the book down!
B00005JKCF|5.0|Before I start my review of the movie, I want to address some of the reviews that I have seen. Some people say:<br />1.) \\"I hate the ending.  Why didn't he stay with Mary Jane at   the end?\\"  My answer to this is--Did anyone listen to the  voice over before he walks away?  He says, \\"No matter what, the ones that I love will always get hurt.\\"  Peter is protecting her from getting hurt.  <br />2.) \\"It was kind of slow.  It didn't have a lot of one liners, etc.\\"  People, it is only the first movie.  They have to do the origin before they go all-out-action-packed.  Also, the one-liners will be more in the next movie after Peter gets more used to his new powers. <br />Okay, now to my review of the movie.  This is hands down the best comic book movie of all time, and the best movie in the last few years.  Tobey Maguire IS Peter Parker/Spider-Man.  He is my favorite actor (before Spider-Man), and after seeing the movie, I have more respect for him than ever.  He needs to win something for his portrayal as Peter. <br />Kirsten Dunst is spectacular as Mary Jane Watson.  I hope she has more screen time in the next movie.  I also hope she becomes more self-assured as well.<br />Willem Dafoe was AMAZING as the Green Goblin.  His facial expressions were perfect, and his voice was creepy.  <br />All-in-all, the years of waiting has paid off.  Spider-Man is definetly going to be in the books for one of the best movies of all time.  Do not pay attention to those who give this movie 1-3 stars. Go watch, and enjoy.

If this were a real fairy tale, it would have been a \\"Grimm\\" fairy tale, because that is exactly what the move is - GRIM<BR>During the first part of the movie, you actually feel sorry for the robot child, David (Haley), and want to \\"beat the living hell\\" out of his biological brother (Martin). <BR>All the compassion ends when his mom abandons David in the forrest presumably protecting him from disassembly.<BR>This is where the movie actually falls apart. David departs on a Pinocchioesque crusade to find the Blue Fairy who will magically turn him into a real boy (or so he thinks). Through a magical mystery tour of so-so special effect robots living and dying in a forrest, at a Brothel city (Rouge City), and at a flesh fair (where most of the robots are uncerimonioulsy dismembered), David and his sidekick (Gigolo Joe, a male pleasure robot, who for the life of me can't remember in the fairy tale) hunt down the messiah, Blue Fairy. <BR>Ending up at the undersea world of Manhattan (Yes, folks, we also have a global catastrophe here), David spends the next 2000 years pleading with a blue fairy statue at a submerged carnival to make him into a real boy... Many have reported the movie as very thought provoking, but all I can think of to ask is: <BR>\\"How would Pinocchio look after spending 2000 years at the bottom of the ocean?\\" <BR>The only thing I found enjoyable in the entire film was the little teddy-bear robot, aptly named \\"Teddy\\".<BR>If I had rented it before buying, I would now not own it and would not rent it again.

B00005JKCF|5.0|Here's a short and sweet review: Spider-man had the perfect balance of everything - just the right mix of action, romance, visual effects, and great acting.  Most of all this story was wonderfully told!!!  Everyone who participated in this movie has something to really be proud of.  Highly recommended.
B000059XY7|5.0|This Superman movie introduces us to the new Superman stars Christopher Reeve, Margot Kidder, and Gene Hackman. Old Story with a 1970's flavor. A treat for the family.
B00003CXI1|5.0|What can one say about one of the biggest BlockBuster of 2001 ?<br />Let me tell you this.........<BR>Spellbound, simply Magical, and always refreshing.
0553573403|5.0|I am not a fanatical fantasy reader but I have occasionally enjoyed fantasy over the years.  After re-reading the Lord of the Rings, I was all tasted-up for some more good fantasy...<br />This is NOT the Lord of the Rings, and I couldn't be happier.  Monsters, dragons, and magic are far form everyday occurrances.  And who needs trolls when you have some of the most loathsome human villains I've read in a good long time.  These are the sort of characters who keep you reading just to make sure they eventually get what's coming to them.<br />There are a lot of characters, yes, but most of them are memorable.  There is a lot of political intrigue, but it is just as gritty, suprising, and often as stunning as the battles.  Over all, the book is well written.  Putting \\"fantasy\\" and all its stigmas aside, the story is entertaining and keeps you wanting more.
6301208773|4.0|Action movies have been around for a long time (just watch some old Cagney or Bogart gangster flicks if you don't believe me). However, it wasn't until the late 70s and early 80s that action movies entered a new domain: that of the superhuman that blows lots of things up due to a big budget. DIE HARD set a new template in the action genre because Bruce Willis' character really isn't a superhuman, he's just a good cop who uses his wits to outsmart the bad guys.<br /><br />The movie re-ignited Willis' film career and his star performance as the bare-footed hero is rather well done for an action film. Alan Rickman is great as the slimy villain, Hans Gruber and Reginald Vel Johnson is a joy to watch as the befuddled cop who becomes friends with Willis' character over the radio.<br /><br />Overall a great movie that has lots of action, a decent script, a little romance, and an admirable; yet human hero.
B0000542DJ|1.0|The most trusted man in America Mr Walter Cronkite called the film JFK \\"a tissue of lies\\".Indeed,from the false opening scenes where a man cops a beating for'snooping'(he was actually beaten over a gambling debt)to the final scene where Garrison leaves the court with his family(he was actually in his office when the verdict was announced),the film is a lie followed by more lies.<BR>We have scenes where a woman in a hospital warns about the upcoming assassination(never happened)to a co-conspirator and possible witness found murdered(never happened).<BR>We have Garrison going to Washington to meet an officer that was in New Zealand at the time of the shooting(never happened).<BR>The court statement that the shots lasted 5.6 seconds is false and the Zapruder film clearly shows that 9 seconds went by.<BR>The sound evidence about other shots being fired,mentioned at the end of the film,has now been found to be in error.<BR>But the best example of what a dishonest film and director we have here is the 'grassy knoll' scene.<BR>Try as he might,director Oliver Stone could not find a gun that would make enough smoke to be seen by witnesses.<BR>Now,does it occur to Oliver Stone that if he couldn't find such a gun then why would an assassin use one? No,instead Oliver then got a man to blow smoke from a bellows to simulate the smoke. Some critics say that sums up the film,full of hot air.The film ends with a line written by a Hollywood writer-Garrison is shown saying \\"let the truth be known or the Heavens fall\\".Mr Garrison wasn't even at the court at the time of the announced verdict,he was in his office at the time.Mr Stone has the gall to talk about truth when he makes up facts.<BR>Oliver Stone has since made other films that have had their historical accuracy questioned.
B00005JKJA|1.0|This movie was an extreme disappointment.  David Lynch created an initial story line that was near film greatness.  A wierd, lush, wonderfully dreamy Val Gal version of \\"The Player.\\"  After all the buildup, we have to watch Lynch pour gasoline on this beauty and deconstruct it into something so awful and cheesy.  I don't think TV is that bad any more.  But even that could have been acceptable IF there hadn't been so many 2001 movies that had the same concepts.  Amelie, Moulin Rouge, Momento, and Donnie Darko all created their own  strange dreamy worlds, and no matter how successfull or unsuccessfull they were, at least their creators had the guts to see their vision to the end.  David Lynch couldn't even do that much.  I believe this man needs guidelines and restrictions to channel his visions.  Without them his ideas degenerate into films that include everything but the kitchen sink.<br />But OOHHH how gorgeous it is until the last hour!  Naomi Watts is wonderful and worth wading thru the mess.  Her two audition scenes are jewel like in their perfection.  Her highly charged sexual scene with Chad Everett was Hollywood sleazy and her Thunderbolt glances with Justin Thoreaux were touchingly tender.  More longing and heat were generated in her wordless scene with Thoreaux then with any of the lesbian scenes that follow. <br />Then the film turns into another story that seems to be shoehorned onto the original.  Lynch didn't even make an attempt to hold his narrative.<br />I won't even discuss the storyline.  Lynch ultimately betrays what he setups with a TV cheesy explanation.  This was supposed to be a protest against ABC?  They were right to turn down this murky mess.
B00005JKCF|5.0|I think this is the best Super Hero/Comic Book movie ever made so far.<BR>Thus far, all I've seen with this genre are special effects and action. Superman I, Batman I, and X-Men came close to actually having a \\"human\\", touching story, but not quite there.<BR>Spider-Man is superior to all these movies!<BR>It is a touching, moving, action, special effects fest!<BR>I cannot wait for the DVD when it comes out---hopefully very soon.<BR>I think Spider-Man will make even more money than Star Wars Episode II this year.<BR>It is the best so far.
B000002NHN|5.0|I've reviewed this album already, but one review is never enough! The sepia-yellow palette of the cover art hints at a dreamlike interlude where you are taken to other lands, all in the comfort of your home or car or wherever it is you are listening. The Book of Secrets is like a numinous journey through exotic musical landscapes and poignant stories. And McKennitt's singing is breathtaking. Her voice an exemplar of beauty and warmth conveyed with superhuman technique.<br />Although frequently categorized as \\"Celtic,\\" The Book of Secrets is not so easily identified in with traditional Celtic motifs. Instead, the roots of Celtic instrumentation are there, but McKennitt's sweeping reach as a composer branches out and touches countless world influences. The production (care of McKennitt herself) is perfect, all concurrently dreamy and robust with lovely echo. In the end, it's not easy to describe, but it _is_ easy to love.<br />\\"Prologue\\" is an ethereal and beautifully haunting track that introduces the exotic percussion styles that will pepper the disc's songs. McKennitt sings only wordless melodies of chilling beauty. <br />\\"The Mummers' Dance\\", the hit single, is probably the most traditional sounding song on the album. The bouncy percussion and infectious chorus makes for quite a danceable folk impulse (despite its slow tempo). Some quirky oud chords here too.<br />\\"Skellig\\" tells the story of a dying cleric who speak to a brother about his life. It's communicated with quiet, luscious vocals and mournful violin overlays.<br />\\"Marco Polo\\" summons forth a vision of mythical Oriental landscape, with Middle Eastern touches, such as the Persian-influenced melody near the end. The song is without lyrics, but not without vocals -- McKennitt's voice is just another beautiful instrument. The perfect song for a road trip through Eastern lands.<br />\\"The Highwayman\\" is, of course, McKennitt putting Alfred Noyes' tragic poem to music. As it is 10-minutes long and all the verses are melodically the same, it seems strikingly repetitive for the first several listens. Repeated listening pays off, my friends! As the story builds to its exciting ending, the surrounding music shifts to accommodate desperation in the poetry. The percussion grows louder and more urgent, the vocals softly building in tension, the instrumentation more dense to signify rising action. It's amazing.<br />\\"La Serenissima\\" is a slow, picturesque instrumental featuring McKennitt's harp and the violin of Brian Hughes. Melodically influenced with a certain Gulf of Venice/Mediterranean touch.<br />\\"Night Ride Across the Caucasus\\" is another lush Celtic canvas of music splashed with full, energizing string arrangements and worldly polyrhythms. The first few verses are calm and sung with celestial beauty. McKennitt may very well be the Goddess of Singing. <br />The valediction of \\"Dante's Prayer\\" is almost prophetic given the tragedy that struck, putting her career on an indefinite hiatus. With that in mind, it is even more moving. The lyrics are tearful but uplifting in a special way: \\"Cast your eyes on the ocean   Cast your soul to the sea   When the dark night seems endless   Please remember me.\\" Smooth, heartbreaking strings weave in and out of McKennitt's serene piano melodies. The song opens and closes with the St. Petersburg Chamber Choir, which sounds a bit morose and eerie.<br />So that's it. Buy this album and enjoy its goodness.
B0000035E7|5.0|Bleach still sounds great after all these years of release. It's a great oppurtunity to hear the whole seattle sound and 'grunge' before it becomes a mainstream phenomenon. Bleach may not have taken nirvana a long time or much money to make but it still is a masterpiece of the band's career.

B000003TAR|5.0|For some reason, in utero took some time to grow on me but it eventually did. Nirvana gave a really great performance on this album through songs like serve the servants, pennyroyal tea and all apoligies. This album has more of a rough edge to it then their other albums but still is great in its own way.
B00005JKQZ|2.0|I was disappointed in this movie because the book is so much better. Russell Crowe is great....It's too bad that Ron Howard is afraid to take chances and always has to play it safe. If everyone thought like him, there would've been no \\"American Beauty\\" or \\"Pulp Fiction\\"...I recommend watching one of those movies instead of this one. If Ron Howard made Pulp Fiction or American Beauty, can you imagine how boring they would've been? The dark aspects of the characters is what made those movies interesting...This is clearly what is missing in \\"A Beautiful Mind.\\" The movie is watered-down to cater to the masses...The director sold out and made a McMovie.
B000003TAB|4.0|Incesticide gives a great collection on non-album tracks. Despite that, the songs like dive, sliver and alternative version of polly are solid tracks that deserve recognition as being great songs. Incesticide gives a strong sense of what Nirvana was.
B00005R87Q|3.0|I rated 3 stars for the Fast and the Furious, well the reason being was because they had nice rides with only imported cars it's kind of tight.  In the Fast and the Furious the beginning was pretty cool, cause of the droped Honda's going under the 18 wheelers cargo, something real astonishing.  In my point of view I, myself like the whole movie.  But the problem was they didn't have enough muscle cars.   I mean what was the whole point of having a cool movie of racing cars but not even other faster cars.  Specially they got too exaggerated with Nos.  They could of least use Camaro's, Corvettes, Mustang's GT's, Cobras, Bullets, Vipers, and some older car's.  &quot;Gone in Sixty Seconds&quot; was way better than this movie.
B000003TA4|5.0|I remember when nevermind first came out and hearing songs like lithium, come as you are and of course smells like teen spirit.  There was just soemthing differnt to the music. I instantly became a big Nirvana fan. I listened to the album a great number of times and never got tired of it. I felt a strong connection the the level of angst and discomfort expressed through the music. Even today, nevermind stands out in my record collection.
B000002UA2|4.0|Actually, this soundtrack is less \\"druggy\\" than the spacey \\"More\\" soundtrack. It does have the atmospheric title instrumental, distinguished mainly by Gilmour's guitar playing, and which is followed by \\"When You're In\\", which sounds rather too much like the same thing (I like to program my CD player so that \\"When You're In\\" actually plays after \\"Wots...Uh the Deal\\". It also ends with the oh-so atmospheric \\"Absolutely Curtains\\", which is pleasant enough with organ and tympani and ending with tribal chants (from Papua New Guinea?). A lot of the material here sounds like a dry run for \\"Dark Side of the Moon\\", which they were in fact working on when they made this album. A little noted fact: this was the first Pink Floyd album on which synthesisers (which would be an integral part of the Pink Floyd sound on their classic '70s albums)were extensively used. Some highlights: <br />\\"Burning Bridges\\"- a nice atmospheric Rick Wright organ piece with evocative Roger Waters lyrics sung by Dave Gilmour on the verses and Rick Wright on the bridge (as they would do on \\"Time\\"), capped off by some great slide work by Gilmour. Perfect early to mid-'70s Floyd<br />\\"Wots, Uh the Deal\\"- Pink Floyd do country(!?) quite well here. More sublime slide playing by Gilmour. Good lyrics by Waters.<br />\\"Wigwam\\"- Instrumental interplay between electric piano, organ, soaring guitar and synthesiser- it's a bit like \\"Any Colour You Like\\" on \\"Dark Side\\".<br />\\"Childhood's End\\"- Great rock song by David Gilmour with (surprise) good lyrics by David Gilmour, with, of course, a great guitar solo by Gilmour.<br />\\"Free Four\\"- a seemingly upbeat accoustic ditty, but the synthesiser chimes in a note of doom at the end of each bar, and the lyrics are gloomy toor, in fact they sum up his upcoming lyrical preoccupations pretty well. He sings about life and death \\"Life is a short warm moment/And death as long cold rest/You get your chance to try in the twinkling of an eye/Eighty years with luck or even less\\";pop stardom \\"So all aboard for the American tour, and maybe you'll make it to the top/But mind how you go and I can tell you 'cause I know/ You may find it hard to get off\\"; and his father's death in the war \\"You are the angel of death, and I am the dead man's son/ He was buried like a mole in a foxhole, and everyone's still on the run\\". Relief and release is provided in the chorus with a soaring guitar solo.<br />Stay- A nice piano piece by Wright, and sung by him, with words by Waters. But again Gilmour steals the show- he and his wah-wah pedal.<br />All in all it was....Obscured by Clouds.
B00005JKYS|4.0|We Were Soldiers is a great movie. Mel Gibson and Sam Elliott were amazing. I especially liked the film because it portrayed the Vietnamese as real people.  You get to see the human side of the enemy that I've never seen in a Hollywood film to date.  It's worth it to buy this film just to see the dynamic between characters.
B000002UW1|4.0|Make no mistake about it, this album has some great songs on it, however there are a couple that I just don't like at all. Those are &quot;Lightnin' Hopkins&quot; and &quot;Oddfellows Local 151&quot;, in which REM take their desire to do hard, harsh, brash rock just a little too far (where are the tunes for one thing?). But I just skip over those songs now. The best known songs &quot;The One I Love&quot; (who's cooly described as &quot;a simple prop to occupy my time&quot; if I hear Stipe correctly); &quot;It's the End the World As We Know It (And I Feel Fine)&quot; (a rapid-fire stream of consciousness list of names and phrases culminating in the song title, with great guitar playing to boot); and &quot;Finest Worksong&quot; (a rousing, hard rocking call to arms) are all good, but then there are also lesser known gems like &quot;Welcome to the Occupation&quot; and the great cutting political march &quot;Exuming McCarthy&quot;; the fun &quot;Strange&quot; and, for a bit of relatively quiet beauty amidst the clamour (unfortunately sandwiched between the two songs on this album I don't care for)you get &quot;King of Birds&quot;.<br />Alright, make it three and three quarters stars then.
B00005YW4H|5.0|Norah Jones is simply the BEST, and her music is refreshingly sparse, and perfectly understated (Just piano, guitar, drums, and her on piano and voice -- no studio trickery here, as she's the real deal!)-- Her arrangements and style come across as elegant or parsimonious, much like the summit of scientific achievement (Think 'Big Bang', gravity, relativity, etc.).  She's as sincere as her influences -- such as Hank Williams, Sr.(And she's SO hot, to boot!)  Buy this if you're into Diana Krall, for sure.  She's more eclectic than Krall, mixing up her jazz, folk, blues and other influences.  Somehow, like an alchemist, she comes up with very catchy songs that seem far greater than the sum of their parts, and that aren't overtly derivative (unlike many of her far less gifted peers in today's music scene...)
B00005JKMQ|3.0|I love boxing and I love watching boxing movies whether they be about a real perons (Jake LaMotta) or made up boxers(Rocky Balboa). Whether Robert DeNiro or Sly Stallone is acting, the story and acting are all great.<br />In this story we have the knockout king Muhammad Ali played<br />by the Prince of Bel Air himself, Will Smith. This is one of the greatest acting jobs I have ever seen almost anyone do. The resemblance and the heart was there, only in wasn't in a very good story. There was no begining (except for the begining of Ali),and no end (except for the end of Clay).<br />I feel they should have focused more on his boxing career and his life more in the film. I was disapointed only in the fact that the focus was mainly on his affairs (wifes) and his religion (no disrespect). If I am watching a movie about one of the greatest boxers of all time, I want to see the before, the middle, and the after. Before he was famous, during his rise and boxing career, and after from the last fight to what happend after. That needs to be in there, especialy if it is about Muhammad Ali. The casting was perfect and the permance by the actors was realy magnificent.<br />19/M
B00004RJ71|5.0|This has got to be one of the best Chicano gang films around! Rather than draw on the Crips and Bloods or Norte and Sur gangs, they used the present-day prison gangs to emphasize their point! I gave it a 5 because this movie was just that damn good! If you bought the DVD, you will be treated to the Directors Cut edition of the movie that includes scenes not found in the VHS version or at the original screen showing! I heard a few complaints from some of my Black friends because of how the movie ended, but I still think the movie is a 5. Get it today!
B00005JKCF|5.0|I just saw this movie tonight and all I can say is WOW!  This movie surpassed my expectations and then some!  It is an action-packed thrill ride with loads of non-stop fun and excitement.  This movie is definitely going to destroy every inconceivable box-office record in history (Titanic made about $1.8 billion, so Spider Man should surpass that in about a few days)<BR>Oh, as for that OTHER summer blockbuster called Star Wars?  There is only one word to describe what I think about it:  FUGGEDABOUTIT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B00005JKL8|4.0|I did NOT want to see this movie.  I have a special distaste for war, fighting and violence wrapped up in my entertainment.  Lucky for me, my husband insisted that our weekly date involve Behind Enemy Lines, whether I like it or not.  Fortunately, the end result was positive in every way.<br />Of course Gene Hackman was his usual high-caliber-acting self, bringing a degree of believability and solid character to the plot.  Owen Wilson was surprisingly good too, leaving me asking, &quot;Where have I seen this guy before?&quot;  Later I found out that he's known for off-beat roles, such as his supermodel status in Zoolander, which is where he'd previously caught my eye. <br />The production of the movie was also above what I'd imagined, with interesting special effects and camera trickery.  What I really enjoyed was what was absent in this film.  Violence, blood and guts and manly macho-ism that peppers most war flicks seemed to be left out of this one, and in its place you get friendship, understanding and real character development. <br />All in all, it quickly became a purchase for our DVD collection, where I further explored to find great commentaries, behind the scenes footage and extra scenes and sequences.  I guess it's not nice to pre-judge after all.
B00004T9UF|5.0|Eminem is amazing on and off cd.This disk is off da hook!His rhymes are smooth as can be and its the funniest rap cd ever!He throws disses this way and that and leaves no stone unturned!What is so special about Em is that he mixes everything together and turns out something revolutionary!He does the gangsta stuff but when he does it it doesent sound dark or sad it sounds funny and hoppin!He has the best personality in rap and if your lookin for somethin that doesent sound like everything else then pick up Slims disk,you wont be dissapointed i promise!!!!!!!!!
B00005YW4H|4.0|Norah Jones' &quot;Come Away with Me,&quot; is an enjoyable, relaxing CD. Ms. Jones owns a very seductive, smokey, and sensual voice. While only 22, she also shows that she has a talent for phrasing a song, and she is clearly a talented performer. She is also very attractive. There's a good selection of jazz, country, and blues songs on this CD. The pacing, or song arrangements, are all pretty similar, which may disappoint some. But in a time when we are bombarded with non-talented, manufactured teenybopper (and older) female singers who screech out every last syllable of a song, it's nice to have a singer like Norah Jones produce this type of music. A very nice debut by a very promising singer.
B000000OTU|5.0|I think Steven Tyler says it best, &quot;Its amazing&quot;
B00005JKQZ|5.0|One of the most harrowing films I've seen depicting mental illness, A BEAUTIFUL MIND will forever change the way you look at that person talking to himself in the street.  Russell Crowe's portrayal of John Nash is a 180-degree turn from his Oscar-winning GLADIATOR role; a man of imposing physicality, he somehow actually manages to make himself appear fragile.  The rawness of his terror and sadness - especially in the horrifying insulin-treatment scene - will stay with you forever.  He was robbed of a second consecutive Oscar.   The awards should be about merit but are no more than a self-congratulatory popularity contest; watch Crowe's performance in this film, and you will see the performance of the Best Actor of the Year, and of his generation.
B00003CX5P|5.0|This is a great movie with incredible special effects. Just because it is the beginning of the Star Wars saga is enough of a reason for it to a great movie
B000063DFN|5.0|Ah, Powerslave.  Iron Maiden's shining masterpiece.  My first experience with the band, and an album that completely and totally blew me out of my chair. (or bed, I guess...)  I had never heard anything quite like it before, and I seriously doubt an album could ever blow me away like this one did again. <br />This album, in my mind, to this day, remains Iron Maiden's testament and tribute to the world of rock and roll.  This epic masterwork has truly changed many things about how I view music, and it opened my  eyes to what most music should truly be: reflections of your soul and heart.  Those things are more than obvious in this album when you first hear the blistering and amazing guitarwork of Dave Murray and Adrian Smith, the masters of melody.  Many people might go their whole lives never really knowing how melodic a genre like metal or rock and roll can be until they hear these guys.<br />This being my first experience with Iron Maiden, I am obviously slightly biased towards this album for opening my eyes towards Maiden's music.  They have certainly released other excellent albums both before and after this one in their lengthy career, many of which I highly reccomend, (in fact, look no further than their excellent sixth album, Somewhere in Time, for some of their best guitar work) but this one still ranks as the top tier in my opinion.  It is the perfect culmination of beautiful guitar harmonies, dynamic vocals, and epic song structures.  Clearly, the band was setting the bar pretty high for this one, and they delivered perfectly.<br />This is the kind of album that sucks you in and doesn't spit you back out and let you regain yourself until the very last chord of its epic closing track.  \\"Aces High\\" remains one of the most brilliant album openers I have ever heard, followed by the equally exceptional \\"2 Minutes to Midnight.\\"  It is then followed by one of Maiden's greatest instrumentals, \\"Losfer Words\\", definitely their most melodic.  This album also containsanother one of my favorites, the extremely underrated \\"The Duellists,\\" an amazing song with some absolutely fantastic guitar parts towards the middle.  I'm sure most of you know about the 2 classic closing tracks of the album by now, \\"Powerslave\\" and \\"Rime of the Ancient Mariner\\" but in case you don't, let me just tell you that there really is no better way to end an album than with this monolith of a song.<br />The problem that I have with most of the albums that blow me away the first time I hear them is that typically, after a few listens, the initial magic of the music cannot endure repeated listens and it ends up getting boring.  I am happy to say this is not so with this album.  If anything, this beauty requires repeated listens to fully comprehend the massive scope of musical skill that's being presented here.  THAT'S the beauty of Iron Maiden, and no album showcases that skill better than this one.  <br />So in closing, this is one of those albums that I will always remember, always respect, and always love, by one of the greatest bands of all time, and if you've ever even considered purchasing an album by these musical wizards, look no further than Powerslave.
B0000024K1|5.0|The second you pop this album into the CD player you are instantly grabbed and shaken by it's forcefulness.  It Takes a Nation...is one of the best hip-hop albums I have ever listened to. <br />Chuck-D, though not as technically brilliant on the mick as say Cali-Tuna from Jurassic Five or Common, he is arguably the best writer in hip-hop history.  Most MC's are stuck trying to figure out how to rearrange swear words in their verse, but Chuck-D has written some intellegent lyrics.  I may not agree with everything he says but at least he's saying something.  <br />The production is also flawless.  This should be what hip hop production is like today.  The only one to come close to it nowadays is Outkast.  The Bomb Squad use samples from everywhere to produce a wall of sound that is uncomparable to anything but Pauls Boutique by the Beastie Boys.  <br />The only things I didn't like about the album were it's lack of bass and the seemingly pointless inclusion of Flava Flav.  Black Steel in the Hour of Chaos is one of the best rap songs of all time.  When I listen to it I automatically bob my head, but it would be a truly break neck beat if a slinky bass line was added at least in the pauses between verses.  Second I don't really see the point in Flava Flav proclaiming the groups atributes on every track.  He doesn't have any verses outside of Cold Lampin With Flavor, all he does is say yeah boyee before every song.  <br />Anyway those are nitpicky problems.  The whole album is excellent, and ranks up their with Pauls Boutique by the Beastie Boys as the two greatest rap albums ever recorded.
B00005RYL9|3.0|While &quot;The Highlander&quot; has always been one of my favorite movies,  I was greatly disappointed by the Tenth Anniversary DVD.  The sound and picture were lacking,  making my VHS cassette a cleaner option.<br />Fast forward a few years,  and along comes the &quot;immortal edition.&quot;  Promises abound about more material,  better picture and sound quality,  and Bonus Queen music.<br />Did the new edition deliver?<br />While the plot and story are the same as always,  quality of the presentation has been rather varied.  The Tenth Anniversery edition was almost painful,  so it was hard to imagine this version not being a step up.  And a step up it was.<br />However,  it could still be better.  The picture's not as grainy,  and the lips are actually in synch this time,  but there is grain to the picture that's not even present in VHS.  The sound is also a step up,  but it could definitely better.<br />Part of the lure for me was the Queen material.  The four videos seemed slapped in there (You can even hear the final notes of &quot;The Show Must Go On,&quot;  an unrelated peice of music,  at the beginning of &quot;A Kind of Magic&quot;)  And the picture is not up to snuff with the other collections that contain these videos.  Of the three music tracks,  two are available on a Queen CD,  where the mixes of several songs used for &quot;The Highlander,&quot;  which woulda been more appropriate,  are still unavailable.<br />I recommend the movie itself,  but could not in good conscience promote this edition and reward such a half assed job.  The movie itself recieves 5 stars,  the quality/presentation of it barely even merits 1 star.

B00005JKMQ|3.0|...omost well cast...the cinematography is excellent...and \\"ali\\" delivers THE BEST FIGHT SCENES i have ever seen in any movie to date!<BR>the major problem is that this movie is really all-gravy...very lil meat to it...they touch on most of the important twist and turns that ali encountered as an adult, but they do not go into any depth into those issues...example: the failure of his first two marriages, ali and his wives are shown loving and caring for each other, some tension arises - nothing openly major - and then BOOM: they divorce in darn near the very next scenes!); also ali's relationship with malcolm x seems deeply brotherly at first - ali is shown at one point running to warmly greet malcolm and then in the very same frame turns a cold shoulder to him and runs off...we know that this scene is s'pose to be reflective of the differences within the nation of islam, but the two central men at this point do nothing to discuss how this affects them...<br />okay...basically what i'm sayin is that there is NO MONUMENTAL DIALOGUE IN THIS MOVIE AT ALL!!!<br />...jamie foxx does an excellent job as does jon voight and nona gaye with what they have to work with, but for a movie that lasts well over two hours i expected more...
B000063TNH|2.0|i bought this movie and it was the only movie that i have ever bought that i wanted to return,it came across as a documentary,and to much spanish ,for my liking,whats the fuss with this movie.
B00005JKED|5.0|...if the hole in the ozone had to be epitomized by a single human being then denzel's portrayal here is emphatically over qualified!!!<BR>he does the damn thang here fareal yall!!<BR>1. dont be squeemish...<BR>2. political correctness does not always rule...<BR>3. life is sometimes harsh...<BR>those are the primary 3 commandments of 'training day'...<br />okay...the ending is a bit flimsy...a rewrite coulda easily have rectified the whole thang, but hey, my name doesnt appear nowhere under the title of executive producer in this movie...<br />but gettin to the end was a fun ride!!! makes me wish i was a crooked cop! (thats a whole lot sexier sounding than being a 'crooked industrial bakery worker'!)
6305428298|5.0|I never heard of this movie until it was coming out on video.  When I read that the title character (played by Jane Horrocks) sings like Judy Garland, Marilyn Monroe and Shirley Bassey (among others), being a fan of these women, I just had to take it home to watch.<BR>What can I say other than I was blown away by the talent of Jane Horrocks.  I also thought that the casting of the other characters was great. Michael Caine was absolutely great in his role of the sleazy promoter, and Brenda Blethyn was truly funny in her role as the overbearing, but jealous mother.  I also liked Ewan McGregor as the sweet and shy suitor to Horrocks L.V. character.<BR>Whatever you do, go out and either rent or buy this movie, but you gotta see it!
B000001F5F|4.0|this is my first live u2 cd (and about my seventh u2 cd bought since mid-april-i just got started), and it is excellent! the one thing that would make it better is a few more songs, but as it is, it is great. especially good are sunday bloody sunday, new year's day, and party girl, a more obscure track. i will follow and gloria are done a lot like the studio tracks, and so of course they're excellent, too. if you don't know u2 very well, you might want to start with a different album (war, the unforgettable fire, all that you can't leave behind, etc.), but either way it's enjoyable.
B000002UDB|5.0|and was already disappointed in the cover, noting that it does not contain the full sleeve like the album did years ago (meaning no picture of Paul eating French fries!) The pictures were the best part - scenes of the movie, on the Mystery Tour bus, and many more. (I always thought John looked like Barry Manilow in those pictures).<br />Overall, though, a good album - personal favorites include &quot;Your Mother Should Know&quot; and &quot;Baby You're a Rich Man.&quot; A good piece to add to my collection.
B00005NW02|5.0|The first album was really amazing and when I heard they had a new album coming out, I knew that it was going to be great and I was correct. The vocals and guitar work are truly excellent. This is not an industrial band, the just make good music period. I am a huge Slayer fan also. So far System of a down and Slayer are the only bands that I know of the haven't yet gone commercial and hopefully never will.
B00005OAIE|5.0|John Mayer is HEAVENLY!  I first heard his voice on a the 'Serendipity' soundtrack with '83' and his voice was so beautiful i had to listen to the lyrics, which are so intelligent and touching, and the mealoides which are indeffinately catchy but intricate all at once.  I had to have more and searched for information over the Internet and all of this guys songs are of an equally star-high level!  'Back to you' is over taking as a song and 'Yours body is a wonderland' has lyrics which simply make you ache they are so good!  All the tunes are inspiring - i simply can't rate this guy enough as a singer/songwriter!  i hope he goes sky high into the industry so everyone knows his name - its a shame not more English people have heard of him!  BUY THIS CD!!! - THERE IS NO WAY YOU CAN REGRET IT!
B00005YU1O|3.0|\\"Waking Life\\" is an unusual and rather bizarre animated film that many critics, including Roger Ebert, thought was one of 2001's best. I don't agree, though I can't deny that it's challenging and ambitious. A challenge that one person finds exhilarating is one another finds irritating. Or, in my case, frustrating and exhausting. <br />Cult director Richard Linklater took his digital camera and filmed a tale about a young man who finds himself in a dream from which he can't awake up. With the help of computers and several animators, these live images were then drawn over to create a colorful and surreal world. The visual results are interesting and artistic. These aspects I enjoyed.  <br />As the young man dreams on, he encounters strangers who tell him their theories about the meaning of existence. Many intellectual ideas are covered, including existentialism, the theory of time, evolution, and free will. The man eventually comes to his own conclusion. I have always enjoyed free ranging debates about who we think we are and why we are on this earth. The problem for me is that you can't have a debate with a movie. It can only present its point of view and, thus, can be only one-sided. Since the main character in \\"Waking Life\\" sits passively and listens for the most part, there is little debate even within the movie. Some viewers, like Mr. Ebert, thought the characters sage and enlightening. I found them pretentious because most of what they say isn't so much intellectual as it is an assemblage of trendy pop culture theories. Of course, I couldn't tell them so.
B00003IQQA|4.0|This is a great CD. Eventhough Creed is widely known for their (perhaps) hardrock tendencies and ripping guitar riffs, I also like the fact that their music is melodic as well. Stapp's (lead vocalist) voice is truly a gem and so personifies the Creed sound. They know ways to reach you, that I've seldomly come across. Their lyrics are deep and heartfelt. This is one CD I would recommend across the board, basically because it's just good music.<BR>The bonus track is a great addition and it also features an hidden track at the end, namely a string version of 'With arms wide open'. Other favorites of mine are the opening song 'Are you ready' but also 'Beautiful' and 'Faceless Man'. Ofcourse the hitsingle 'With arms wide open' and 'Higher' are special too.<br />All in all a great addition to every collection. If you haven't already gotten yourself this copy, go out and buy one SOON.
B000002LBH|4.0|While I feel that \\"Meat Is Murder\\" is, song for song, the best thing the Smiths ever did, \\"Louder Than Bombs\\" deserves special recognition for being one of the few B-sides/rarities collections that isn't mostly filler. Most of these songs are legitimate keepers that hold up surprisingly well.<br />It's hard to imagine a band from the 80's not sounding dated in 2002, but the Smiths were born to break rules. Their stripped-down vocals/guitar/bass/drums approach was a rarity in the age of big hair and shoulder pads. The songs were what mattered, and even if lead singer/lyricist Morrissey put his depressed, broken heart on his sleeve one too many times, it was still good songwriting performed with talent and charisma. Johnny Marr's prowess as a musician and songwriter is in full form here as well.<br />\\"Louder Than Bombs\\" makes for a nice Smiths sampler...the album covers roughly the entire timespan of their career. Highlights include the breezy \\"Ask,\\" the anthemic \\"Panic,\\" the brilliant single \\"Hand in Glove\\" and the frenetic \\"Shakespeare's Sister.\\" Of the 24 songs, there's maybe two or three I don't care for. Not a bad ratio at all.
B000063CPL|5.0|The best live peformance that I have ever heard.  Iron Maiden proved with Brave New World that they could still rock and now with this cd they have proved that they can live up all the bring the house down.  Defnitly a great buy.
B000000WF0|5.0|Short and very sweet.  When I got married on May 30, 1999, there was no other song that I would have even considered while my father escorted me down the aisle.  Bittersweet Symphony still gives me chills when I hear the simplicity of the melody and lyrics combined with the duality of the memory from that day and how accurate the compex message of those words are.  I will go to my grave with the music of The Verve's-Urban Hymns playing in the background.  THE ABSOLUTE BEST CD EVER MADE!
076790382X|3.0|I didn't enjoy this nearly as much as &quot;Sunburned Country&quot;, perhaps because, as an Australian, I could more easily identify with the foibles of Australian living.Granted, these American stories were published in weekly form in a newspaper column,but somehow it came across as being &quot; picky&quot; to a degree--perhaps I shouldn't have read 2 Bill Brysons in a row.

B000062TU1|5.0|I liked it for  one reason i wasn't a harry potter fan i actually sort of hated it and didn't know why every one liked it so much one day i went to the movies andthe movie i wanted to see was soldout so i saw harry potter and it was relly good but since i never read the book i didn't know if it was that good then i read the book and it is like it not totally (but then none of the books turned into movies are excatly like the books) it was close but when you read the book your imagination can do much more things than movie special effects. over all i read all the books and can't wait to see the movies. if you reaaly like harry potter then buy the DVD.
B000050XEI|5.0|First of all, I love all of Enyas albums.A day without rain, is the same style Enya fans have come to love.It may be a little short but,SO WHAT,all artist have some albums that are longer than others.Are we going to put Enya on a timer? If you dont think its worth the price,dont buy it! As for me,this album has the same beautiful music,both vocal and insturmental,that I found on all of her other albums. And Roma did a great job on the lyrics. Now I have to say this. I wish some people would stop criticizing Enya so much. Things like, she needs to change her style,all of her songs sound the same.Do you people listen to her because you like her music,or are you just looking for something to gripe about? Why dont you go pester someone like Ciline Dion,Britney Spears,or Pink? Those girls,and some others out there,could learn something from Enya about music. Most rock and pop singers,male and female, could learn something about CLASS from Enya.When was the last you saw Enya in public half neked? NEVER! And in case you havent noticed, several million copies of this album has sold in the US alone! This tells me someone likes Enyas style or she would not be doing so will,would she? If you wont to listen to alot of screeching,there is pleanty of that music out there.But if you like soft-gentle music and a beautiful voice,then Enya is for you!The next time you Enya critis listen to her music,try it with your fingers out of your ears and I bet you will like her as much as I do.

B00005QG9J|5.0|When I first heard of Incubus, it was from &quot;Stellar&quot; on the radio off of their album, Make Yourself. I fell in love. They grew more famous with the pop scene after releasing &quot;Drive&quot;, also off of Make Yourself. When they released the album, &quot;Morning View&quot;, I was first in line to buy it. I am happy to say this is one of Incubus's greatest works. It's definitely lighter sounding and more &quot;mature&quot; as lead singer Brandon Boyd puts it. Every track on this album is beautiful as beautiful as it is powerful. They have a selection of songs that display their new style such as the crisp sounding &quot;mexico&quot; and the melodic, fun &quot;Are You In&quot; and some songs bragging their old, heavier style such as &quot;Under My Umbrella&quot; and &quot;Just a Phase.&quot; This CD is for everyone, not just lovers of metal or rock. Teens who prefer bands such as LFO will enjoy this just as well. Brandon Boyd's beautiful and unique style of singing still doesn't fail to move fans to tears and Mike's genius with the guitar will have you listening to this album time after time. A MUST-HAVE for anyone who loves music!
B00005RHGL|5.0|As a fan of movies, I find that most films labled as &quot;The Director's Cut&quot; just add scenes for the sake of adding scenes (&quot;Star Wars: A New Hope Special Edition:&quot; the scene between Biggs and Luke was not needed or acted well). But if you are lucky, you'll find a &quot;Director's Cut&quot; that features scenes that help better round out the story (&quot;Highlander 2: The Renegade Version,&quot; &quot;The Abyss Special Edition,&quot; and &quot;Superman: The Movie Expanded Edition&quot;). One of those fortunate films is George P. Cosmatos' cut for his epic western &quot;Tombstone.&quot; Released under Buena Vista's successful &quot;Vista Series&quot; packaging, &quot;Tombstone,&quot; my choice as the best western film ever made, now includes almost five minutes of footage that really give a better understanding of the story and the characters. And the lavish 2-disc set is filled with unbelievable extras, including three behind-the-scenes featurettes, including a brilliant look at the filming of the OK Corrall sequence, which was authenicated down to the last detail. A brilliant edition to the DVD collection. Tell 'em Wyatt Earp's coming, and hell's comin' with him. Grade: A+
B00003CXXJ|5.0|When I first saw previews of Shrek, I compared it with a Disney-wanna-be in all the wrong ways. I avoided it at all costs. My 3 year old daughter went to see it with her father and when it came on DVD, she begged for it. I went against my better judgment and bought it. I ignored the first 3 minutes of it, missing the storybook, and so, missing the link between spell and princess. Then within the first 5 minutes, a fart and burp joke, I rolled my eyes. From then on, I ended up interested in it, enjoying it. I've been a fan of Disney movies for a long time, but this was so fresh and new. All the Disney-in-jokes were a trip. Everytime Donkey tried to sing, Shrek shut him up, and we all know how Disney loves to throw a song in when there is nothing else to say. I LOVE the Gingerbread Man scene, he should have had more screen time. And the voice actors were wonderful for their parts! There were some adult oriented jokes, but they went over the kids heads completely. I have yet to know a child that got the joke about Lord Farquaad's &quot;big castle&quot;. And if they do get it, their parents should be shamed :P The whole story was just adorable. Beauty and the Beast, but just who is the Beast and who is Beauty? That's what's great, they are both the Beast and the Beauty. Gotta watch that karaoke scene too! That was too funny! Please, please, don't get my close-minded mentality like I did when I first heard about it. Rent it, buy it, watch it. FINALLY, a movie parents WANT to watch with their kids!
B00005V9QJ|5.0|I purchased Lovers Rock and when I heard about Lovers Live I had to go purchase it also.  Mostly because of the clips to be seen via DVD.  Her voice, especially on Slave Song, By your Side, and ...Already Broke My Heart, touches a part deep inside of me and the music for the CD varies making you want to dance on some, meditate on others and just chill or groove on others  all on one CD.  I have other CDs of hers but her music is maturing along with the artist herself.  She moves more now in the video than before and seems much more comfortable on stage.  Kiss of Life shots show the way she touches others.  She belts some vocals on Is it a Crime while cruising on other parts.  The bass is rocking on No Ordinary Love and many of the other songs.  I am so pleased she is back and if you love peaceful, loving music, this is the CD and Video to purchase.  The vibe is right on!
038533558X|5.0|I have read and loved all of Harlan Coben's books. This is no exception. The plot races and the ending came as a total surprise. You may be able to figure out a few of the plot twists, but for the most part I was as clueless as Will. How can you not like a book that identifies a character as &quot;probably male.&quot; I miss Myron, but Will and Squares are worthy substitutes!
B00005T30L|5.0|I think this movie was one of the best movies ive ever seen Thora Birch play in, she did a excellent job. At first i thought the movie was gonna be some washed out comic book movie, but after i watched the first 10 minutes. I was totally hooked.<br />Ive watched the movie countless of times, i borrow my friends VHS of it, i rent it almost everytime i go to hollywood video, i love enid's accent and how shes a &quot;1977 style punk&quot; which you rarely ever see anyone like that in the movies. I didnt understand the glasses though, cause most people who have thick rimmed glasses are the ever so popular 'emo' but we wont go there.<br />after watching it 28 times i can say that this is a great movie.
B00003CXI1|5.0|I am a huge fan of everything Potter and very much enjoyed the film. I was thrilled that as it was a British book, set in britain and written by a Brit, that it was kept this way through out. Not that im slating other countries and their films, it was just so refreshing that it was all kept as it should and was in the book. I cant wait for the next book and for chamber to be released on film. Naturally there were many scenes left out and a few things changed for the film, but if they had put everything in the film, it would have had to be at least 4 hours long.<BR>Bravo Harry, cant wait to see you again!!
B00003CXXI|1.0|Before I even reached the middle of this movie, I'd had it up to *here* with stupid farty-pee n'poop cliche jokes.<br /> I mean, they cliched the cliches. Who really wants to hear booger-green fat guys babble on about out-laws being outlawed because they FART too much?! COME ON!!!<br />How original! NOT!<br /> Shrek is so dull and lacking in wit, I literally tried to sleep but the stupid fart sounds kept me awake.<br /> The main character was so thrown together, it sounds like the creators realized too late he absoloutly stunk, so they had to keep him. Fiona plain rots. Nuff said.<br /> The donkey is so stupid and trash-mouthed, I don't get how anyone can say he is \\"cute and lovable\\".<br /> The animation is nothing spectacular, and never had me \\"ooing or aahhing\\" about any of it. But, then again, that could've been because I was rolling my eyes over the lousy dialogue and [dumb] one-liners.<br /> They must think that throwing in some loud and annoying music will attract the younger crowd and distract from the movies terribleness.<br /> Definately not a movie for kids (or sane adults), since along with pokes at poop jokes, it uses questionable words to almost beg the older generation to laugh at them. The only thing it cranked from me was a moan.<br /> Sum it up: Farts, poop,bad language, lame storyline, booger green ogres just don't mix. Get Toy Story 2. Now that one had me laughing...
B00005QK3W|3.0|After seeing Paul last night in \\"Big D\\", I realized two things: 1) Paul has written (or co-written) many of the greatest songs of the last 40 years. 2) Paul hasn't written a \\"great\\" album since his days with Wings. The problem here is that the songs just don't have the staying power of JET, YESTERDAY, MAYBE I'M AMAZED, BLACKBIRD and hundreds of others. It's not a truly bad album, just very average. When you hear the new tunes played right next to the classics, it's easier to dismiss them as weak. On their own, written by someone we didn't hold to such high standards, they'd be just fine. But, just fine won't do after the absolute pop perfection that Paul has been cranking out since 1963. Still, McCartney's got more skill and talent then almost any modern artist getting airplay today (see your local top 10 for proof of how lame music has gotten in 2002), and I still believe the man has got a few more classics to give us in the future.
B00005JKBC|3.0|This is the second of two Redford films released in 2001; it's better than \\"The Last Castle\\", maybe because Redford chose his second of the two character types that he likes to play...in this one he plays the \\"the charming con man\\" (The Sting, Butch & the..., etc., etc.)<br />The film will hold your interest - fading back and forth from past to present, with some terrific cinematography.  Brad Pitt holds his own as a man true to his principles, and a creature of puppeteer Redford's making.  Neither character ages believably in the film, however....Brad and Robert can't pull off their younger characters in Vietnam based on their appearance.  Tony Scott is a fine director, and many of the DVD features are enhanced by his contributions.<br />Wow - the DVD itself ....  Read on to other reviews.  There is a closed captioning problem, and the navigation and design is very poor.  I think Universal did the DVD...hope they are reading all these comments and planning a new version, if they want this film to be purchased, not rented.<br />Advice...rent, don't purchase.  Prepare to be annoyed by the operation of the DVD and caught up in the storyline!
B00005R2BG|5.0|This movie is spectacular! (spectacular!) Both volumes of the soundtrack are my favorite CDs, and the film is my favorite among the many I've seen. Almost everyone I know has seen it and would say the same thing. It's not a traditional musical, but if you like this sort of thing, you'll love it too.
B000005RMY|5.0|I came upon this compilation quite by accident while travelling in Austria.  I had already listened to the Slight Case of Overbombing comp when I was several years younger, and remembered thinking that I liked some (but by no means all) of the songs.  With that, and my obsession with any band's \\"early stuff,\\" I found, bought, and shipped to myself the double-LP version of Some Girls Wander By Mistake.  Miraculously it survived the transatlantic fourth-class shipping journey to end up in my youthful, disaffected, and contrary hands.  And of course on my turntable, where it's been for almost two years now.  I play it constantly, and it's hands down one of the best purchases that I ever made.<br />  Comparing this to the Sisters' other stuff, I would definitely rate this as their best.  Alice alone is worth the price you'll pay for the importation.  But wait, there's more!  You also get fantastic songs like Kiss the Carpet, Valentine, Floorshow, Temple of Love extended version, among others.  I could list all of the songs, but why do that?  You're better off getting this release for yourself, and finding out (after listening confusedly to the Sisters' later albums) why they were considered goth at the time, and why they were such heavies in the early 80's british goth scene (back when most folks used to call it 'death rock,'...)  Yep, this fantastic compilation is right up there with Christian Death's \\"Only Theatre of Pain\\" in greatness, both of these albums being goth without the whiney/cheesy 'vampires and bloody roses' type imagery.
0393316041|5.0|This was a great read for me; I recommend it to anyone who wants to read about an interesting character who led an exciting and varied life, and especially those readers with an interest in math/science. My only complaint: I wanted more when it was done, well Mr. Feynman did write another collection of anecdotes so here I come!
B00004YW6I|5.0|If you like pj youll need to get this now
B000063K62|3.0|Well, for the most part, anyway.  There are a couple of monologues here that rise slightly above the level of a mediocre second-year student, though none could be accused of being profound or particularly insightful.  (It is a testament to the intellectual poverty of our times that so many viewers think otherwise.)  Sex and drugs (mostly sex) would have greatly livened this movie.  They would have fit in well, too, since they are as natural a part of the sophomore's life as waxing sophomorically philosophical.  Of course, something with philosophical depth might have served the auteur's pretenses better.  But the fact is that movies cannot do serious intellectual work; they consist, after all, of pictures, noises, and music.  (Speech, too, of course; but that takes second place to the pretty colors and sounds.)  This is probably why introductory philosophy courses haven't yet been reduced to offering cartoon enactments of Plato's dialogues, though I have little doubt that a comic-book version is on the way.<br />Not that the movie is all bad.  It contains several moderately amusing scenes, and the unique visual style is both soothing and alluring.  The plot--or complete lack thereof--makes it an easy ride, very like a pleasant dream.  Watch it late at night, preferably when you are either very tired or on pot, and with someone you find sexually appealing.  Then do some \\"philosophizing\\" in the style of \\"Waking Life\\" until the two of you are breathtaken by your collective wit and wisdom.  Then get it on like starry-eyed college kids inaugurating the Summer of Love.  You won't be sorry.
B00005YW4H|5.0|this disc is amazing!! Norah Jones is great, and when I don't want to listen to my alternative or rap, Norah Jones is the perfect selection. She's got a smooth, crisp voice, and the music is nice and mellow. Nothing hard-core, like what I usually listen to. I listened to it today, and it just calmed me down. Where I live, we've had rain all day, and Norah's music evened everything out. Another reason why I love this CD so much is because it reminds me of my favorite holiday, Christmas. It has this comfy feeling...it's great to play in the house and have the sound fill the house, it just makes everything so much cozier! I'm also copying this CD for my mother for Mother's Day...I know she'll like it! My favorite song on this album is \\"Don't Know Why\\"...it's great!! Hopefully you'll have the chance to listen to this CD if you haven't already...and if you haven't, then you're definitely missing out!
B00005JKCF|5.0|Sam is back!  The first show that started 9:10 a.m. was not a very happy experience for me, but it's good to see Sam Raimi regain his flair for rousing actions that has been laid aside since the 1990 \\"Darkman.\\"  And looking back from now, it was very fortunate that Cameron didn't take the helm of the production for the hero-image of \\"Spider-man\\" is more unconventional than all-American one, which Leo or Arnie might have been struggling to handle.  No way.<br />Anyone with some knowledge about comics or TV should have been already seen this wonder boy Tobey Maguire who gains his incredible power of hanging from walls and buildings.  Unlike other superheroes, however, \\"Spider-man\\" emphasizes on his personality as an ordinary boy, who thinks of his extraordinary spider-like ability as a curse.  And I bet you do, even if you got a kiss from Mary Jane in the form of Kristen Dunst while you're hanging from up above, showing only your lips!  <br />Yes, Sam Raimi shows again his deft skill at mixing those incongruous elements -- darkness behind heroism and romance between a boy and a girl -- and he even throws unexpected comical moments into this hero's adventure, making his Peter \\"Spider-man\\" Parker's character more human than you expect.  There's no machismo, no obligatory love scene.  But that's what Raimi's style all about, which curiously matches this unusual hero from Marvel Comic.<br />So, don't try to find something similar to \\"Superman\\" here (though you get some funny allusions to this popular hero; watch how Tobey discloses his costume baring his breast on the street, the same way Christopher Reeve once did in the first \\"Superman\\" film.); the touch of the film is completely different, and though the film itself never forgets to entertain us with its exciting high-speed action sequences, the strength lies in its slightly off-beat presentation of this hero's life in America, and especially New York City.  I was greatly amuzed to see the city depicted from a new perspective, that is of course, from high up above the city.<br />Supporting cast is also very good, and my special mention goes to ever-getting gorgeous Kirsten Dunst, whose eccentric beauty goes along well hand in hand with Tobey Maguire's oddly amusing, droll superhero image.  And it is only natural that Ms. Dunst's past filmography helps greatly -- you know, she was in \\"Interview with the Vampire\\" (she was a child vampire) and \\"The Crow -- Salvation\\" (wow ... with another dark hero).  <br />Though it doesn't have the groundbreaking special effects that impressed us in, say,  \\"Matrix,\\"  \\"Spider-man\\" is a great achievement after all, which can be done only by first-rate crew and cast, and this case again, kudos to Mr. Raimi, to whom I really want to say: Welcome back, Sam, and please, please,  don't make any more baseball film.
0452282152|4.0|This little book has great characters.  It doesn't take long to read, but it will stay with you for a while afterwards.  I have passed it on to several friends and family and everyone has loved it.  The characters feel real and you want to know what's going to happen to them.  It's fun to imagine that this is really how the painting came about.
B0000636UN|5.0|Guess I lost track of Sheryl Crow, sort of stereotyped her from &quot;All I Wanna Do.&quot;  Somewhat by accident, started listening to this album, and I'm very impressed.  Sheryl Crow has developed into an excellent musician and a great songwriter.  Even the most pop numbers, like &quot;Soak Up the Sun,&quot; are more musically complex than initially meets the ear.  And the album as a whole is an expression of a mature and complex vision by the artist, in a way that's also accesible to my 14-year-old daughter (no mean accomplishment).  I must confess I'm a country fan (Hank Williams country), and Crow's use of country idiom in songs like &quot;Abilene&quot; is flawless.  And &quot;Weather Channel,&quot; with Emmylou Harris, is a tour de force on every level, chills run down my spine just thinking about it.  <br />By chance, I've been re-listening to &quot;Exile on Main Street&quot; by the Stones, and see some similarities in the way that both these albums bring together a rich pastiche of influences from rock, blues country and pop.  Of course, this album is no &quot;Exile on Main Street, but it is great rock n roll.<br />BTW, I also have picked up &quot;The Globe Sessions,&quot; which is an equally excellent album ... how did I miss it?
B000008H1Y|5.0|Tull Rocks! This album rocks! It is at the top of the list as the all time best Tull album ever made... Songs From The Wood stands alone nicely... Get This!! Hard Acoustic Flute Rock with a gentle breeze inside... You will not be disappointed! <BR>This album deserves 5 Stars!
B00004Y6O9|5.0|This is my first Van Halen album, and all I can really say is...wow!<br />this is one of those extremely rare records without and filler or throwaway tracks. dave, eddie, mike, and alex all sound great on this disc, espescially Eddie and his finger-tapping &quot;eruption,&quot; which is my favorite track on the album. It's already become one of my personal favorite guitar solos.<br />If you want to get into van halen, most definitely pick up this record.
0380973650|5.0|Neil Gaiman has written another outstanding work here: dark, disturbing chronicle of the war of gods and cultures, a translation of Old World mythology to the highways and byways of the new.<br />This is one of the best fantasy novels of last year, and stays with you long after you turn the last page.  Highly recommended.
B00005Q4CS|5.0|Marlon Wayans, Jared Leto, Ellen Burstyn, and Jennifer Connolly. the amazing four. <br />Harry(Jared) is a junkie that is living with his mom. One day, him and his bestfriend Ty(Marlon) gets into sellin pure coke and starts to make money. And there's Harry's gf, Marion.<BR>Harry's mom, who seems to have obsession about being in a spotlight, is infatuated with a tv show called The Juice.<br />sound effects and transitions, etc. they were just amazing. this movie is truly something check it out
0441003257|5.0|The Apocalypse and the Antichrist might not seem like fruitful topics for a comedy, but this book succeeds in making them just that.  The devils have the wrong antichrist, the snake from the garden and his opposite don't really want the world to end, and the Four Horsemen ride motorcycles.  Absolutely hilarious, and rumor is that Terry Gillian may soon be directing a film adaptation.  Highly recommended.
B00005JKCF|5.0|All I can say is WOW!!!  From the opening scene to the end credits, I was blown away by the visual effects and storyline.  Although there were a few differences between this version and the comic version, the story of Peter Parker and Spiderman are pretty accurate.  Maguire does an excellent job playing Peter Parker, as did Dunst, who played Mary Jane \\"MJ\\" Watson.  Excellent cinematography and special effects!!!
B00003CXZ3|5.0|This sort of movie is not really my thing, but I enjoyed it just the same, and I can recognize it certainly is a fine movie. I prefer more visually appealing screen blockbuster action-type flicks with lots of special effects myself, but there are a lot of classic movies I enjoy, and this one will probably become a classic in its own right.<br />The overall premise is quite interesting, since the scenes occur in reverse order, as you watch the memory-impaired Guy Pearce try to solve the mystery of his wife's murder. Pearce does an excellent job in the role, as he methodically gathers the evidence and tries to sort it all out depite his memory impairment. <br />Before his memory defect occurred, he was an insurance fraud investigator, and if it's one thing he learned from his old job, it's the importance of having a system for gathering the facts and considering the evidence. Pearce does just that, and by taking photos and writing notes on them, he is able to remind himself of the facts he has discovered during the course of his investigation and ultimately solve the mystery.<br />I also enjoyed Pearce's role as the professor in the recent remake of the Time Machine. All in all a fine flick and worth seeing even if you're not into more thoughtful kinds of movies like this one.
B00000J7RZ|5.0|I have never owned a better cd in my life, and I have like a million cds (okay 40) This is pop, r&b, latino, and more. Almost all of the songs are really good!<BR>If you had my love- my favorite! it's the best<BR>should've never- okay, a slow song, but pretty good<BR>too late- also a really great song!<BR>feelin' so good- 7/10... good<BR>let's get loud- kind of salsa-ish, really really fun to dance to<BR>could this be love- yes, it could... this is a good song too<BR>no me ames- weird, but okay <BR>waiting for tonight- awesome song<BR>the rest of the song are all 6/10- pretty good, but nothing special. but songs 1,3,5,6,8 have a great beat, cool lyrics, and a totally tight sound! You gotta get this!
B00005O5JV|5.0|This movie is the best PG-13 movie I've EVER seen!!! I think that someone who goes from sorority girl to Harvard law graduate is amazing! It shows that anyone can change. Also, Vivian goes from snobby rich girl who was Warner's fieance (Warner was also Elle's boyfriend for a time) to Elle's best friend. She is able to use her fashion facts to prove someone guilty and save one of her friends from going to jail. Like I said in the beginning, its the best movie EVER!! It is so funny that you will want to watch it again and again!!!!!!!!!!!!
0140186409|5.0|So often I find myself chasing the best sellers when looking for a book to read but more recently I have moved back to the classics and after The Grapes of Wrath I am thankful I made the move.  The story is perplexing and scares you into wondering how the country let its fellow citizens live the way they did.  There are some wonderful characters and they come and go in mysterious ways.  Take the time to read some of the classics and start with the Grapes of Wrath.
B00005JKBC|4.0|Are we seeing Brad Pitt as a young ROB Redford? Great combo. Reminded me of &quot;Sneakers&quot; with more of a CIA twist. This movie<BR>keeps you going, trying to figure out what Redford will try next.<BR>It's a keeper for my collection. As for recommends to &quot;Training Day&quot;---pass---that was one that started great and went dud.
0684833395|5.0|At first I thought this book had a pretty slow pace to it, but once I got beyond Heller's style, I found it to be a very humorous and entertaining depiction-or mockery-of our country's military, and of the way people in general tend to think. It has a lot of good insight into the decisions we, as humans, tend to make, and of the effects our constant need for approval will have on our lives. Great book...I haven't laughed so hard in a long time!
B00005JKL8|4.0|I wish more of that parry between Wilson and Hackman continued. MOst of the story ran quickly and great. Think they dragged the ending more than it should. But, beyond that, Behind Enemy Lines<BR>is well worth seeing once, twice, and so on. Look forward to two actors working together again.
B00003CXS4|5.0|This was about one of the most entertaining movies I have ever seen and the special features, don't get me started on the special features.  I felt like I busted a gut!  Hilarious!  I think it's one of my most quoted movies.  I don't know why, maybe it's because of &quot;zee germans&quot;!  Watch the movie and you'll get it.  And if you buy the DVD...goody gumdrops!
0671042858|4.0|As an avid reader of King's works, this book surprised me in many ways. As most of his readers know, The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon is especially different from King's previous works. This story was certainly more realistic than most others because it did not deal with the supernatural. I was hesitant in reading it, but pleasantly surprised. He kept my interest throughout, and although it was realistic and nothing too earth-shattering as far as the climax of the story, it was a page-turner. King never fails to keep me turning the pages - with the exception of Insomnia perhaps - and once again, he has gained my approval. I would love to see this as a movie. The episode/s of the bear throughout the wooded area reminded me so much of Gerald's Game. I was beginning to think that the 'something' that was watching the girl would end up being a figment of her imagination because she was becoming so ill and her health was declining. Thanks SK, once again. Next one up will be Hearts from Atlantis. (I know it's been out a while, but I rotate authors with King always along the way...)
B00003CXRP|5.0|...Anyway, Cast Away was great...a new concept in cinematography proving that their is something new under the sun.  It was amazing how one man alone could go through such peril by himself.  I think the funniest thing was I cried about Wilson...  And I wanted to know what was in the box!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B00005JKED|4.0|This film starts with an excellent premise and then sprints straight out into left field, makes a right turn at incredible and lands somewhere between absurd and ridiculous.  Actually, I enjoyed the film, but this day of mayhem and corruption is so far from believable that it diminishes the film's value.<br />One of the most important factors in a good cop film is realism.  It requires not just realistic guns, explosions and car chases, but realistic and authentic characters and a plausible story.  In this film, almost all the characters are way over the top.  Rookie director Antoine Fuqua brings great intensity to each frame from his music video experience, and most scenes have an imposing power that grabs the viewer and chokes off his air supply.  However, Fuqua's failing in this film is that of excess.  There are no moments of calm to create contrast.  The film is all storm.  It is well done, but exhausting.<br />Denzel Washington is a great actor.  I say this without hesitation.  However, this is nowhere near his best performance.  He was far better in both \\"Hurricane\\" and \\"Malcom X\\".  He was robbed in 1993 when the best actor award went to Al Pacino for \\"Scent of a Woman\\" instead of going to him for his performance in \\"Malcolm X\\".  In \\"Training Day\\", Washington tries far too hard to be bad.  He overacts in spots and he is so intent on being forceful that he neglects character nuances, normally his greatest strength as an actor.  So, while I consider this to be a strong performance by any other standard, comparing Denzel to Denzel, this performance is just slightly above average.  This year, Russell Crowe got robbed.  However, Crowe won it last year despite the fact that both Ed Harris and Geoffrey Rush gave better performances.  What goes around comes around, I suppose.<br />Ethan Hawke was also nominated for his supporting role as Jake, and it was a nomination that was well deserved.  This is the strongest performance I can remember from Hawke.  His is the most credible and nuanced performance in the film, despite being in Washington's shadow.  He is helped, of course, by the fact that the character is the only one that is anything like a real person in the entire film.<br />This is a vigorous film that never lets up.  The action and the psychological tension are first rate.  It is just too overblown to be real.  And to be great, cop stories need to be real.  I rated it 7/10.
B00003CXS4|5.0|Black hummor dose not get much better than this. This is the best of its kind I have seen since Frago. Brad Pitt, Jason Stathman, Dennis Ferina, and Benico Del Toro(who just broke through with Traffic)all give this there very best.<BR>However the movie is twisted and is not very easily offended. <br />Its one of those movies thats about bad guys destorying out of greed and fear. Its like a more complex and hummorus version of &quot;Reseroir Dogs&quot;.
B000050IE6|5.0|Opeth!! how can i begin to describe this band! Introduce to this band from a friend at work .I have been into Metal for over 14yrs, from Heavy to Death , Speed -Trash-and Black Metal  which  I have a Supernatural love for. This band takes me into the darker of darker realms... and keep one's consciousness in the definition of uniformity in a straight line. As the CD progressed into each track it gets better and one is enveloped into the world of the dark Magical Arcane.(love the growl).I will end with a quote from Victor Hugo.<There is nothing more grandeur than the sea to that of the sky and there is nothing more grandeur than the sky to that of the interior of the soul> Opeth touches my Soul.........
B00003CXP1|5.0|It has been said by many reveiwers. I will say it agian. This movie just KILLS! There is no other movie about drugs that I have seen that is this powerful. <br />The movie tells three related storys of drug abuse that dose not led to an upliftitng final. <br />To all the easily botherd movie goers out there. This will certainly make you sob, and will stay with you for a little while. Requiem for a Dream is a tour de force of extreme darkness and sadness. <br />That dose not change the facted that this is a flawless movie.<BR>I can honestly say that the brave film making here well not let down any ture movie goers. Ellen Burstyn's perfomance left me speechless.
B00004ZAV3|4.0|I love the stereo versions of the old tracks. To the guy that's mad that they're not the DULL mono versions... Get over it with your pretentious dribble . The Beatles are the greatest band ever, mono, stereo, or 5.1. <BR>As for those who are don't like it  because your favorite song was not on the CD, don't be a primadonna. Sure, some of my favs are not on it, so what, I've got all the other albums because I am a true fan, not some sniveling momma's boy. You're what's wrong with this world. Too many full grown babies.
6305603847|5.0|It would be hard to explore the mind of a famous rock star about to have a terrible mental brakedown and make it anymore brillent, vivid, and clear than this. Pink Floyd the Wall is strange a tour de force about going nuts. <BR>I gess the film was to weird for some. That's very beliveable. Thanks largly to Bob Geldof's sensational performance. That won't leave your mind for awhile after watching this.
0875847706|5.0|A wise book about transforming yourself<BR>and others. I went to a lecture of Benjamin Zander in Holland<BR>and enjoyed it every bit. He practices what he preaches.<BR>Great inspirator.
020530902X|5.0|Well. This is a masterpiece. Buy it, assign it if you can, but do read it. I opened it up recently in a colleague's office, and within the first three rules fell back in love with it.<br />But beware. For instance, the previous reviewer has some pretty large comma errors in his/her prose. I guess this text could also be a cause to believe you don't really need a basic English composition course. It isn't.
B0000636UN|3.0|Given that Sheryl's first album had major contributions from songwriters and musicians like David Baerwald (Welcome To The Boomtown),the late Kevin Gilbert and producer/mixer extrodinaire Bill Botrell. \\"C'mon C'mon\\" suffers from a bit too much mid-70's Stones sound,probably due to Lenny Kravitz' involvement and Crow producing the album herself. The lyrics may be more introspective,and it seems the perennial party girl is willing to share her pain and troubles. This new writing style would seem to be suitable to a more stripped down production approach. \\"C'mon C'mon\\" is not a bad listen, but not as good as \\"The Globe Sessions\\"
B000002IWL|5.0|I have not heard this CD, but I had the record album with many of these songs back when they first came out.  All I can say is, they made my girlfriends cry. This was not due to my personal attractions.  They cried because these songs are beautiful.  These songs touched something inside. If I could go back to the night when we listended to these songs together, I would do so in a heartbeat.
B00005JKJA|5.0|Wow! I couldn't believe this film! I was getting tired of the smae old movies with the same old boring plots. Then this!  I must say the first time I saw it I thought \\"What the heck was that\\"?!? But trust me this is one to see over and over again! David Lynch has again proven that he is an awesome movie maker!
B000062XFG|4.0|You know, it's just not fair. I plunked down just as many shekels for this NextGen box set as I did for the first one. Now that might not seem like much of a problem to most, but here's the messed-up part: this set contains only six DVDs, rather than its predecessor's total of seven . So why am I paying the same price for something that has less? Wouldn't it make more sense for me to pay six-sevenths as much? Of course, if that screenwriters' strike hadn't cut down NextGen's second-season eppie total, I wouldn't've had to worry about it in the first place...<br />...but enough griping, at least for the moment. Compared to the original series DVDs, the NextGen platters have more episodes per disc (four to Classic Trek's two), and the and the box set takes up about the same space as three standard-width snap cases. Which means the entire run of NextGen DVDs will take up about two-thirds as much space as the entire run of original series platters presently do. Of course, this makes me wonder why Paramount didn't give the classic show a similar treatment in the first place? After all, when it comes to collecting Star Trek on video, shelf space becomes an essential commodity. This is after all a franchise made up of five series, nine (soon to be ten) movies, and a cartoon show, with endless sequel & spin-off possibilities! With these facts staring a DVD-collecting UberTrekkie in the face, one can NEVER have too much shelf space, and... um... whoops, I did it again, didn't I? Sorry `bout that. Gimme a mome to get back on track, okay? Thanks...<br />While not particularly exceptional, NextGen's second year was a fair improvement over the first in many respects. It displayed a potential that would eventually make it a worthy successor to its 23rd-century forebear. The follicular abilities of Riker & Picard went in opposite directions as our beloved overly-dramatic-pose-prone executive officer sprouted facial hair. Worf & LaForge receive new uniforms and new duties. Also noted here is Ten-Forward and the first poker games between the members of the bridge crew. Then there was THE big shake-up: Dr. Crusher was temporarily replaced by a somewhat McCoy-ish woman who wasn't too keen on the notion that Data might actually be more than a mere machine. Sadly, Dr. Crusher neglected to take her son Wussley-- whoops, I mean Wesley with her, much to the chagrin of most NextGen trekkies outside of the adolescent female demographic.<br />A few of the show's high points in Year Two:<br />Being a big fan of the Borg, I consider `Q-Who' to be the best moment of the second season. In this show, Q introduces our star-hopping protagonists to the Borg-- and the rest is history. `The Measure of a Man' is probably one of the best Data-showcase eppies ever made. In fact, a good portion of the second season was dedicated to the further character development of Starfleet's most valuable android: There's `Elementary Dear Data', as he plays the part of Sherlock Holmes tracking down a self-aware holodeck creation of Prof. Moriarty. I found it to be a better-than average entry in the show's run of `Holodeck Malfunction' eppies. In `The Schizoid Man', Data's taken over by the consciousness of a dying cyberneticist. `Pen Pals' has our beloved android making covert contact with an alien child on a dying world. Riker also gets some development in `A Matter of Honor' and `The Icarus Factor', both of which have a bit more action than the average NextGen eppie.<br />Then of course there's the shows I'll likely skip past when I host my next NextGen marathon:<BR> Being a Wesley Crusher anti-fan (as any self-respecting NextGen Trekkie should be), viewing his first crush with a young lady who can morph into a weird furry wookiee-thing in `The Dauphin' was almost unbearable. And although `The Royale' is kinda fun to watch in a cheeseball way, it's definitely not one of the series' more able entries. To top things off, they saved the worst for last: the season finale `Shades of Grey'. I prefer to call it `Riker's Greatest Hits', since about half of the footage for this show was culled from the first two seasons, all of it featuring our beloved Number One's greatest moments of both blissful pleasure and hellish torture from the show's first two years.<br />As I expected, the sound quality of each episode is really good, far better than their preceding VHS presentations. The subtle background sounds are more perceptible. The picture quality, however, is not as consistently good as that of the First Season set. There are a few parts here and there that look a bit grainy. Of course, this may be due more to the quality of the source film than the digital transfer, but I couldn't tell you for sure one way or the other.<br />The extra features include several documentary featurettes, which cover pretty much what you'd expect from TV docs: behind-the-scenes looks, memories of the show's second year from both cast and crew, and other info. If nothing else, these featurettes are a good way to prep you for that trivia contest they'll be holding at the next convention that blows into town! I found the doc about the Star Trek archives- a vast collection of props, models, backdrops, and set pieces from all the shows and films- to be the most interesting of the lot.<br />And now, my biggest gripe about this set: Paramount decided to make the foldout disc holder out of cardboard, which means you'd better expect this storage unit to disintegrate faster than a Romulan hit by a full-power phaser beam after several NextGen marathons. Well, unless you have some duct tape ready that is.<br />`Late
B00003CXTG|5.0|Why do they need to have lame awards like the Razzies? How could people be so cruel by giving out \\"Worst Movie Award\\", \\"Worst Actress Award\\", or \\"Worst Actor Award\\"? I think 'Pearl Harbor' was an excellent movie and should not have been nominated for any Razzi Awards! Whoever started these awards are very shallow and dull. But anyway...back to 'Pearl Harbor'.<BR>'Pearl Harbor' didn't have to be completely accurate because it is a Hollywood blockbuster. It's not a documentary. 'Saving Private Ryan' was not totally accurate, because I thought that they were being a little over-dramatic, especially with the battle sequences. Yes, there is a love story. Yes, I think they were trying to streatch the movie to be a little too much like James Cameron's 'Titanic', but it was still good in it's own right. You have to give them credit for the effort.<BR>The battle sequences were incredible, and even the love story was not totally boring and kept me interested. Most people stayed for the battle sequences...but I actually stayed for the love story (call me a \\"hopeless romantic\\" if you must).<BR>Forget the Razzi Awards and the bad professional critics...rent 'Pearl Harbor' on DVD today!
B00005B4GU|1.0|Ive listened to thousands of different bands of various rock genres,most of them being underground.Then all my friends began to rave about an older band called \\"Radiohead\\".Curiosity struck me as i went online to learn that many consider Amnesiac and other Radioheads albulms to be the ultimate,uniquely artistic cd ever recorded.So i downloaded the full albulm and other past songs to find out for myself.First of all,the albulm kinda drags on for the first few tracks.The guitar playing is okay,a little too much reverb or high setting on the phaser pedals.I was disappointed to find out that the fabled Radiohead takes a disaterous turn into the uncharted realm of techno and trance music.I might be wrong,but Thom York's lyrics seemed to get weaker on this albulm then in past releases.Maybe his well of creativity has run dry or hes just forcing the songs out too much.....On a positive note,the cd case might would make a fabulous coaster.
6305609705|5.0|For starters, this DVD is transferred in a 2.0:1 aspect ratio anamorphic format, not the 2.35:1 listed on Amazon or the 1.85:1 mistakenly referred to by some reviewers. This is the ratio that cinematographer Vittorio Storaro and Coppola prefer for home theater.<br />For much of the film, the smaller ratio actually serves as an improvement, by increasing the visual impact of the scene on your home TV. But in some of the best scenes ever put to film -- such as the helicopter attack, the Napalm attack and the entrance into Kurtz's compound, you lose a little too much on the sides of the frame. <br />That said, I'm not disappointed. Why? Because whenever you view a movie at home instead of in a theater, you are making a compromise, especially with as big and as bold a movie as Apocalypse Now Redux.<br />Other than that controversial decision, the sound and video quality are superb. The colors are brighter than in the original, due to a Technicolor dye process added in the Redux version. The additional scenes are fascinating, and really fill out the story. (Most people don't like the French scene, because it does seem out of place, but I thoroughly enjoyed it.)<br />By the way, if you are one of those weirdo purists who doesn't like the extra scenes, fine. Stop whining about it and just hit the next button and skip the track.<br />The real travesty with this DVD edition, as you can tell from my title, is the almost total lack of extras. This is a completely barebones disc, with the exception of the trailer (shown in 2.35:1). If ever there was a movie lending itself to another disc or two full of extras, this is it. Heck, there is even a documentary made about this movie! (Hearts of Darkness: A Filmmaker's Apocalypse, by Coppola's wife). But do we get it here? No. In fact, it's not yet available on DVD at all.<br />...<br />So, to sum up, this is a great DVD of one of the all-time great movies. But, \\"definitive\\" it's not. We'll probably have to wait for the High Def DVD version in 10 years for that.<br />Enjoy!
B000002J1S|5.0|The Genesis we see in 'The Lamb' is in many ways different from what we've seen, whether it be the whimsical, witty, and distinctly English social commentary of 'Selling England by the Pound' or the 80's soft pop incarnation of Collins.  Unlike the 3 other albumns of the Gabriel-Hacket period, 'The Lamb' displays collections of short, compact tunes and intrumentals instead of long, varied progressive composistions.  However, viewing 'The Lamb' in terms of a bunch of short songs would be like viewing 'Supper's Ready' as a bunch of individual songs.  It is means to be heard a whole long story of Rael's odyssey.  what odyssey is that?  One could theorize that it is Rael's journey from hell (The Grand Parade of Lifeless Packaging) to heaven (It) through purgatory. (The Chamber of 32 Doors, the red ocre corridor, the Lamia's pool, etc.)<br />The story begins with the exhuberant, piano-driven title track, which introduces our 'hero', Rael.  Then it slows down for 'Fly on a Windshield', then picks up the moment poor Rael keeps hit with the breathtaking 'Broadway Melody of 1974'.  Then it slows down for 'Cuckoo Cocoon', only to pick up with the 8-minute, frantic, and eclectic 'In the Cage'.  Rael gets a glance at 'The Grand Parade of Lifeless Packaging' in the next short, snappy tune, before we take a side tour to get a glance at Rael's personality.  'Back in NYC' is a great songs with a superb repeating rythm, and is followed by the beautiful intrumental 'Hairless Heart' and the witty, humurous 'Counting Out Time' which recalls Rael's attempt to woo a female with the advice from a book on erogenous zones.  Hilarious stuff.  Then we leave behind the snappy rock tunes and move back to the plotline and into the albumn's best song, the mystical, mesmerizing 'Carpet Crawlers'.  After we're done here we take a trip to the 'Chamber of 32 Doors' before ending the 1st disc.<br />Disc #2 wanders a bit.  It starts out with 'Lillywhite Lillith', which reflects the snappy tunes of Disc#1, before moving onto the chilling, gothic intrumental 'The Waiting Room' and the near-instrumental 'Here Comes the Supernatural Aneasthetist.&quot;  Then we pick back up again with a song remsniscent of 'The Carpet Crawlers' and the 2nd best song on the albumn.  'The Lamia' is a beautiful, poetically written, and extremely odd narration of Rael's encounter with a trio of 'vermillion snakes of female face.'  The song ends stirringly with Hacket's best performance on the albumn.  Then we move to the mourfnil 'Silent Sorrow' before kicking back in with the very, very bizzare 'Colony of Slippermen.'  Then we get another instrumental, 'Ravine', before cutting to 'The Light Dies Down on Broadway', which utilizes slower, more dramatic tunes from 'The Lamia' and the title track.  This, IMO, is the albumn's climax, where Rael must make his final choice.  I won't go into any detail, but that choice leads him 'In the Rapids' where he is 'Riding the Scree' before he finally arrives at his destination: 'It'.<br />'The Lamb' is an enigmatic, strange, throught-provoking work that represents a summa of musical acheivement and, simply put, is not to be missed.  Do it for your own good.  It's brain food.
B00003CXZ4|5.0|Memento has been a cult smash ever since folks had a chance to see it. It didn't do well in the theatres because nobody knew how to market it (the trailer is truly awful), but it has done excellently on video due to wonderful word of mouth.<br />Definitely pay a few bucks extra for the special edition. The main disc is weak on the extras, and doesn't have a DTS soundtrack (DTS is much better than Dolby 5.1 if you have a DTS-decoding receiver). <br />What is really engaging about this movie are the twist and turns along the way that lead to a very satisfying payoff. The mind-bending going backwards in time bit is an interesting idea, but could easily have been a ponderous disaster in less sure hands than Christopher Nolan's. Each of the 10-minute flashback seens begin and end in exactly the right places. Each new revelation and twist leads logically to the next.<br />The movie's weakest point is that, in the end, you don't like any of the characters. They are all selfish bastards, in a sense. Hey, but that's film noir for you. If you didn't like The Usual Suspects or Reservoir Dogs, you probably won't like this one. I however loved those movies, and found Memento to be endlessly fascinating.<br />I'm just hoping for a Memento prequel. (There's definitely room for a few).<br />Enjoy!
B000031XCR|5.0|Celineee is the best singer, ever. I love her music so much!*! I don't how I could live without her and her beautiful music, and beautiful voice. Her voice is so angelic to me. On the Interview with Barbra Walters in 2002, Barbra said that Celine's voice they say made Angels' weak. I believe that that is true, do you? hehe*! Just asking. Anyways,, this CD is ver good. ...This is album rocks. Although I wish she would've added Call The Man and Where Does My Heart Beat Now? song here, but Where Does My Heart Beat Now? is already on The Collector's Series Volume One album, so that is very good, I have that album:-) I reccommend this album to any Celine fan, out there. Buy IT!*! It's worth every ... cent of your money...!
0812550706|5.0|The book, Ender's Game, gave me confidence in things that I didn't think that I could do. It encouraged me and it told me never to give up no matter what, to always try my hardest.<br />Ender's Game is a terrific book written by Orson Scott Card. It is about a boy, Ender Wiggin, who goes to Battle School (located in space). The purpose of Battle School was to separate and train military geniuses to fight the Buggers (an alien race) but the battles at Battle School, aren't really battles but games.<br />Ender Wiggin is the greatest soldier in Battle School history. He has great leadership and respect. Ender Wiggin is the best of the best. Time is running out. Will the human race continue?
B000065U1N|3.0|In typical Ridley Scott fashion, this film micro-focuses on details to an almost excruciating degree, while the big picture pales in a mirky background. Its length makes it overlong for what it is, lacking clear focus on plot, overall message, or taut action. I hoped to see clear indication of morale or lack thereof on the part of the soldiers. I hoped to see a sense of mission or lack thereof in the Somali war. I hoped to see a clear sense of whether these soldiers knew what they were fighting for, or whether the war for them was an exercise in confusion and/or futility. But none of those things came out clearly. Instead it just seemed like a disjointed sequence of often vivid clips with no clear whole emerging. The result would better befit a documentary of maximum length around 90 minutes. Some more successful war movies, like PLATOON, are clearly focused on an unrelenting sense of the horror of it all. Others, like SAVING PRIVATE RYAN, are equally unrelenting in maintaining a sense of mission amidst the carnage. But this movie is caught in a no-person's land between those two poles. And for me at least, that was far less effective.
B000000WCX|4.0|When I became a fan in the early days of &quot;Aladdin Sane&quot; (1973), I could never imagine David Bowie would go on to become such a revolutionary and long-lasting name in rock music. One aspect that I find amazing about him is that he avoids what I call &quot;the nostalgia act syndrome&quot; at all costs. For instance, while most of his contemporaries just play a token selection from their latest album and fill the rest of their concerts with &quot;greatest hits&quot;, Bowie sang all but one of the songs in &quot;Earthling&quot; in his 1997 tour. He did more or less the same thing in the &quot;Outside&quot; Tour in 1995/96.<br />In &quot;Earthling&quot;, Bowie does what he did with &quot;Scary Monsters&quot; in 1980: he takes up the latest brand of rock music and beats the new acts at their own game. In &quot;Scary Monsters&quot; it was new wave. In &quot;Earthling&quot; it is jungle/industrial music. I feel this album is somewhat underrated. Only Bowie fans seem to realize its brilliance. Any album that has &quot;Little Wonder&quot;, &quot;I'm Afraid of Americans&quot;, &quot;Telling Lies&quot;, &quot;Looking for Satellites&quot;, &quot;The Last Thing You Should Do&quot; and &quot;Dead Man Walking&quot; has to be a winner. I'm sure this album will have its importance reevaluated someday, but the 1997 tour will never come back. I saw the three shows in Brazil and I'll never forget them. Bowie has put out two little gems in the 90's: &quot;Outside&quot; and &quot;Earthling&quot;. How many artists from the late 60's/early 70's are still relevant today?
0783225849|5.0|...This is one of his best.  Hitchcock was a spectator rather than a participant in the sexual attractions and yearnings throughout his films.  Right from the beggining of Psycho, the camera pans to the window of a hotel room where two people are in the afterglow of a \\"Long Lunch\\".  The film draws you in and never lets up.  David Lynch parodied lots of details from Psycho and other Hitchcock films in his recent \\"Mulholland Drive\\", from the hat the \\"real director\\" wears, as Hitchcock does in Psycho, to the buzz of the light when he appears.  The gray suit that \\"Betty\\" wears to her audition was taken from Vertigo.  But it was Psycho that set the standard.  Anthony Perkins endearing performance as \\"Norman\\" shows a young man with frustration and vunerability.  You really believe he could never harm a fly.  Janet Leigh and John Gavin were incredibly classy.  Vera Miles should have taken home an Oscar.  Hitchcock was nominated, but sadly did not win.  He should have.  Don't miss this movie.

0060916540|5.0|Racing throught the last chapter on a crowded commuter train out of London - I was on the verge of tears and almost missed my stop.  I would recommend this book to anybody, it's not just for people interested in adventure and climbing.  It's truely outstanding.
B000002H72|5.0|With Doolittle, the Pixies expanded their audience beyond college radio thanks to &quot;Here Comes Your Man&quot; and &quot;Monkey Gone to Heaven.&quot;  This album features all the Pixies standard tools -- the slow verse/fast chorus/slow verse style that Kurt Cobain emulated, vocals that go from nearly speaking all the way to shrieking and everything in between and clean guitar riffs bolstered by a solid rhythm section.  While they sing about cult movies and the enviromentand, they throw in some silly love odes and have fun doing it all.  This album will make you want to jump up and down in glee.  This is my favorite Pixies effort.
B00003CXSP|5.0|Having watched Silence of the Lambs beforehand will give greater understanding and appreciation of Hannibal.   This movie IS Hannibal, whereas Hannibal was just one of the characters in the former movie.  Here, he is much more developed as a character and he's free from beginning to end, whereas in Silence he was in jail until the ending.  He is a brilliant psychiatrist, he has class, he's cultured and he's mysterious.  Hannibal's handwriting even characterizes him, such as his unique signature for the title on the cover of the movie and the sheer fright of Clarice when she receives an envelope with her name on it written by him.  Hannibal's voice and speech contribute to his uniqueness of character.<br />Hannibal picks up where Silence left off, with a gap of time where Hannibal has been reclusive.  In this movie, he comes back into the public spotlight.  He is much more refined here, intelligent, slick, and he's a mad, cannibalistic serial killer.  Needless to say, he's intimidating.  Hannibal continues to attempt romance with Clarice, the FBI agent who is back on the case to capture him.<br />Unlike so many movies, this one doesn't turn out to be a good guy vs bad guy theme.  Sure Hannibal the Cannibal may sound evil and the FBI you would think would be the \\"good guy\\", but that's not how it turns out.  Hannibal is the star of the movie and he's not all bad.  He only kills people who seek his demise and he hates rudeness.  As Mason asked, \\"Sssoo...does Lecter wanta ... 'er, kill 'er, or eat 'er or what?\\"  Possibly all three they think, they just don't know in what order.  But he ends up doing none of those to Clarice.  He's very polite to her.  So Hannibal isn't \\"the bad guy.\\"  And the FBI isn't the \\"good guy\\" because of how as Hannibal put it, Clarice hates the FBI and it hates her.  Early in the movie she is suspended from the FBI for a drug bust gone bad that really wasn't her fault.  So thankfully, like hundreds of other movies, there isn't the usual \\"good vsevil\\" theme.<br />Francesco DePazzi works with \\"Dr. Fell\\" and finds out he's wanted by the FBI under the name of Hannibal Lecter.  He tries to have him captured for the reward, but Hannibal is too slick for him.  He apparently was on to him all the time, because he gives intimidating looks and gestures to Francesco, only to then appear friendly.  Hannibal tells Francesco's wife, \\"I've enjoyed many good meals there [in the New England states]\\" in front of him.  This must have really scared the hell out him, as Clarice warned him, \\"he will kill you.\\"  Sure enough, Hannibal tapes him up and has him propped  on a balcony  wearing a noose.  He asks him, \\"Bowels in or out?\\"  Obviously a little scared, and his mouth taped shut, Francesco doesn't elaborate.  \\"Oh, you look confused.  Perhaps you'll allow me to decide.\\"  Hannibal slices him open with a knife then tosses him out the window and his bowels fall out, hanging to the ground.   Hannibal kept his word not to touch his wife if Francesco would give him information.<br />Mason Virger is Hannibal's only surviving victim.  Years back, Mason was a child molester and a patient of Dr. Lecter's.  Hannibal had his face torn off and fed to a dog.   The ugly deformed Mason Virger is a stark contrast with the beautiful scenes of Florence, Italy.  I was wondering why Virger, with all his money, doesn't get plastic surgery for that face of his.  The Man-eating hog pit scene was unforgettable.  It was scary how Hannibal was unrepentant and unafraid, and really, acting the same way he always does, even as he stood helplessly tied up awaiting a tortuous death.  \\"Your little brother must smell almost as bad as you do now,\\" says Hannibal to the man who is propping him up in the hog pit.  Hannibal slit his brother's throat in the library after he killed Francesco.  It turns out Clarice saves Hannibal and he then takes her to safety and removes a bullet from her.  Only Virger and his men are fed to the hogs.<br />After Hannibal stitches up Clarice, she wakes up in a bed, wearing the shoes he bought her and a dressed up beautifully in a black dress.  He undressed her for the dinner and put her in the dress.  I wonder what, if anything he did with her while she was nude and unconscious.  She is woozy and flashes of the movie are shown blurry, like we're seeing through her eyes.  This part was especially like a dream, or really a nightmare, as is the whole movie.  Hannibal is downstairs also dressed up cooking some fine food.  Her hated co-worker, whom she was the subordinate of, is also there, apparently drugged up by Hannibal.  When this man came home, Hannibal startled him by saying \\"Good!  You brought the wine,\\" then knocked him out.  He is then at the table with Hannibal and Clarice, only he is wearing casual clothes.  H slices open his head and cooks part of his brain and feeds it to him while he's alive.  Clarice calls the police, which Hannibal is quite aware of but he takes him time.  While he is kissing Clarice, she snaps on handcuffs so they are joined by the wrist.  She doesn't have the key, so Hannibal chops off the cuffs.  He asks, \\"Above or below the wrist?\\"  then says, \\"This is really going to hurt.\\"  Then all we see is the look of pain on her face but she seems uninjured afterward, while Hannibal has his arm in a sling on the plane in which he makes his getaway.  <br />The movie ends with Hannibal getting away to an undisclosed location, leaving the possibility for a sequel to Hannibal.
6301969294|2.0|Oh, it's hard to rate this film with stars.<BR>The problem is dramatic; Pat Neal is mesmerizing as Dominique, and Vidor moves the movie along with brilliant momentum.<BR>Then we have Gary Cooper, who seems embarrassed - as well he should - by the cartoonish dialogue. All right, Rand wants to ram her objectivist views down every available throat. But surely someone with a sense of good dialogue was near the set? Her screenplay is riddled with sentiments expressed as subtly as the 'Ka-POWS!' in the Batman TV show. Herds of sheeplike businessmen say 'But what's the good in originality?', or, 'Look here, old man, one mustn't fight popular opinion!'. It's really that banal.<BR>Too bad. I don't much care about the philosophy Rand espouses, either way. What bothers me is that a ridiculously clumsy trumpeting of it ruins what good have been a classic film.
B000060P79|5.0|Simple Plan, has exactly that type of music.. is simple, and thats wuts so attractive about this group. Not only do they appeal to the teenage crowd, they express their thoughts and feelings in such a care-free and insightful way. Simple Plan is a great new group, and is only going to get even bigger, so your review on &quot;No Pads, No Helmet, Just Balls&quot; is completely the opposite of many youths opinions.
B00005JKBC|5.0|This movie was great, Brad Pitt gave an awesome performance and I think that Robert Redford was the perfect addition to this intriguing and beguiling movie--<BR>THUMBS UP!!!!
6305609721|5.0|The Voyage Home.  The punker on the bus (Kirk Thatcher).  The humpback whales.  Spock trying some &quot;colorful metaphors.&quot;  Chekov in big trouble.  A newcomer named Catherine Hicks providing some good 'ole 20th century humor.  And most important, the return of the Starship Enterprise (and Kirk becoming Captain again did help as well).  There's nothing to dislike about this movie.<br />The transition to DVD is excellent.  The score isn't Goldsmith or Horner, but it served its purpose.  The effects are more realistic.  And the trailer is better than the previous two!<BR>But the real reason this has five stars is because Paramount gave us one more bonus, Nimoy's featurette.  Good piece of info to hold onto.  Overall, you will be thoroughly satisfied with the movie.
B00005JKCF|1.0|I thought about giving Spiderman 4 stars but decided against it.  This is the most boring action movie I have ever seen.  Aside from the horrible CGI, it really really drags.  Over 2 hours???  Why?  Throw out all the useless, underdeveloped character (Uncle Ben, Aunt May, Harry Osbourne, all the insignificant references to Spiderman comic book personalities), and you might end up with a decent 1 hr 40 min film.  And no it did not follow the comic book.  Anyone who says that is lying...all the more reason to get rid of some characters.  I fear the coming of Spiderman 2, or as I will call it, Spiderman Again.  I know it will be rehash becasue of Hollywood's unrelenting philosophy...  \\"If it makes a lot of money, make it again.\\"
B00005YXZH|5.0|Every once in a blue moon a release that actually deserves all the &quot;Hoopla&quot; piled upon it comes along. Of course along with it always comes the feeble minded listener who catches wind of this and makes the big mistake of taking the BIG JUMP onto the bandwagon. This would probably include all of the negative reviewers here. But they can rest easy knowing that they can trade up at some record stores now. Heck there is probably an entire case of new Dave Matthews or Goo Goo Dolls just waiting for them there. To them I say good bye, good luck and please don't strain your brain.
B00000J7JO|1.0|If you own 'Californication', you have no right to make fun of those unfortunate kids who still like Limp Bizkit. The Peppers were the Bizkit of the 80's. Then they threw out this overproduced album and all the Peppers fans rejoice in drooling praise because its actually quite musical and catchy, something thats been rather lacking in past Peppers albums. Yes, the trendy nudity-loving band makes a purely commercial album and people automatically fall in love, never even stopping to consider the band's \\"integrity\\" because they've just taken it for granted for so long. This is the Pepper's 'Chocolate Starfish and the Hot Dog Flavored Water'
B000006OS2|1.0|If you love McLintock! as much as I do, you WON'T buy this version from Good Times Video. The overall quality (picture, focus, screen ratios, etc.) is absolutely awful -- this goes for both their VHS and DVD versions.  If I could give it a half star I would.<br />Apparently, the John Wayne Estate or his family lost control of either the reproduction or marketing rights to McLintock! some years ago, and Good Times took some Scotch brand tape, staples and chewing gum and patched together this awful copy.<br />The good news is that John Wayne's family authorized a VHS version made from the original master footage, which is excellent.  Look for an orange box with the Wayne family authorization printed on the front.  Let's hope The Duke's family will work to produce an authorized DVD of McLintock as well.
B00004RE7C|4.0|People have attacked this movie because it is III not II, or IV, or VI for that matter.  But I will be the one to say that Leonard Nimoy did a fantastic follow-up to The Wrath Of Khan.  The Search For Spock may not have the great enemy, or the great space battles.  But, in the same light Back To The Future II was the perfect sequel to the first, The Search For Spock is the perfect sequel to TWOK.<br />James Horner's followup score is marvelous, focusing on a more slow paced film.  The abduction, and destruction, of the Enterprise (I cry almost every time) gives it its distinction.  The intro of the Excelsior, Grissom, and klingon Bird of Prey (along with the believable storyline which brings Spock back)  make this vehicle a worthwhile trip.  And yes, the entire crew CAN act.<br />As far as DVD quality goes, yes, it brings the overall quality of the original movie as I saw it in '83.  Yes, the trailer helps!  Yes, the score is great!  And if the movie itself isn't a good reason to get it, then the latter reasons should be.  It isn't TMP Director's Edition.  But, it ranks up there.
B00005JKJA|5.0|There are no chapter stops because the film should be seen as a whole. This, ladies and gentlemen, is a work of art.<BR>Many have tried to &quot;solve&quot; the puzzle of Mulholland Drive. Some feel they have. It has been a couple of weeks since I first saw this movie and I'm still thinking about it. I enjoyed it even more the second time.<br />This movie is to be experienced! Naomi Watts is fantastic.<BR>The supportive characters are classic David Lynch.<BR>Open your mind to a refreshing thriller that doesn't do all the work for you and understand that there will be many things that will qualify as &quot;loose ends&quot;.
B0000009OP|5.0|Interested in which album to buy first? &quot;Cure For Pain&quot; is the ideal Morphine album for the uninitiated to sink their teeth into. After purchasing it nine years it ago it has yet to gather dust on my shelf. <br />It's all in all a solid play. A Great bridge between the freshman release &quot;Good&quot; and the more aggressive third album &quot;Yes;&quot; both highly recommended as well. <br />FYI, this is a band &amp; album that is best heard at night.
B00005QIPH|1.0|That's what I wondered after listening to this album.  Is this IT? ...the Strokes?  The band that's being compared to Velvet Undergroud???  This is the most oversimplistic, underproduced garbage I've ever heard.  I can't believe what [junk] it is.  So \\"Last Nite\\" is a good single and a so is \\"Is This It\\"  And maybe perhaps down the road, Julian Casablancas has some talent in the songwriting department, but the lack of musicianship kills this album. There is no sound to the album.  The vocals aren't muddy and unclear.  The drums aren't well-mic-ed not to mention played with little skill or variation in style.  The guitar playing is mediocre and all the riffs sound exactly the same.  Honestly, I find it difficult to distinguish between the songs because they all sound very similar.  This group focused a ton on their look and not enough on their music.  I'm still shaking my head at this horrible, horrible album.
B00000ILBK|4.0|Insurrection is, and is not, a lot of things.  It IS a movie with a strikingly similar fashion to that of a TNG episode.  It is a visual effects masterpiece.  It is the most off-beat of Star Trek movies. And it is that uniqueness that allows Insurrection to hold its own.   <BR>In contrast, Insurrection IS NOT the best of the movies, or one of the best.  It is not the worst of the other 8 either; I've held that spot solely for Generations.  And if there is one thing it is definitely not, it is not the parallel of The Search for Spock.<br />The DVD, on the other hand, plays on the visual effects and score by making look and sound more stunning.  Bonus trailers and featurettes on one DVD make it a great keeper.  However, it will never rival the Motion Picture, or First Contact.  <br />Bottom line - Buy it for the DVD.  Just to say you own all of 'em.
B00002NDB1|2.0|This was my first Iron Maiden cd.  I bought it for very cheap at a used cd store.  Now I know why it was there!  \\"Futureal\\" is an ok song, but it doesnt even compare with their older stuff.  \\"The Angel and The Gambler\\" is probably the best song on here, if you can listen to all of it without getting bored.  I guess \\"When Two Worlds Collide\\" is another decent song, but thats about all.  The guitar work is pretty good this album, but that's not enough to make you wanna listen.<br />Definitely don't buy this if you are new to Maiden, because it will leave you saying \\"What's everyone talking about? Iron Maiden's not that good\\".  Anyways, You have to give them credit for coming back and making one of the best albums of their career, \\"Brave New World\\".  Luckily i decided to give them a second chance after i bought Virtual, because their older stuff rules!
6304711875|5.0|After years of not being able to see the movie (because of my age) and hearing stories about it, I finally had the chance to see it. Just watching the best part of the movie, the opening scene with Drew Barrymore as Casey Becker, made me want more and more of that - and thats what I got! The whole movie is filled suspensful moments and suprising outcomes! You have got to see this movie, reguardless of the negative things people say about this movie. You surely will not be disappointed.
B000002IWH|4.0|okay.  so i'm not much of a metal fan.  my tastes are more mainsstream than the hardcore stuff that's on this album.  but i really enjoy almost all of the songs on this album. much like the film, it's a dark and dreary affair, but songs like &quot;Burn&quot; and &quot;Dead Souls&quot; &quot;Time Baby III&quot; &quot;Big Empty&quot; and &quot;Ghostrider&quot; make this CD more than just your usual soundtrack.  All in all, I'd recommend this to fans of the movie or fans of music in general, mainstream or metal.
6305910103|4.0|First, The Wrath Of Khan.  Need I really say anything more?<BR>Second, the DVD does bring out the best in this movie.  With a remastered James Horner score, more space battles with the beautiful Enterprise refit, and Khan, the supreme emeny (sorry, Alice Krige), there is absolutely nothing to dislike about this DVD.<br />So, why four stars, and not five?? Because it is not the director's edition of Star Trek The Motion Picture.  It only has one trailer!!  Surely, if they committed themselves to a better budgeted, blockbuster smash, they would've done more in the advertising section!!  And no bonus features??!!<br />Sigh, at least there is August 6th...
B00003CWTI|5.0|Only one word describes Magnolia - Superb!<br />It should be nominated in every category , and won, in the Oscars. Instead, the more palatable American Beauty got all the attention.<br />I love Magnolia. This was the last masterpiece of the 20th century. What a fantastic director that P T Anderson was able to transform Tom Cruise into a real fine actor. As for Julianne Moore, she's breathtaking. <br />Watch this alongside Robert Altman's Nashville. You have no idea what you're missing unless you've seen them both.<br />I can't wait to see Anderson's next film.
B00004ZAV3|5.0|My family owns nearly every Beatles vinyl album ever made. They are all nearly worn out after so many years of use. When I heard this CD was coming out I knew it was a must-have. The Beatles &quot;1&quot; CD includes 27 songs from their albums that reached #1 on the charts. It's about time someone put together the Beatles top songs on one CD. The Beatles certainly did not invent rock, but they  just kept re-inventing and redefining rock, and became the most respected band in the world.<br />Every song on this CD is a hit. Ranging from sweet, loving songs like Love Me Do, creepier songs like Elanor Rigby and classics like Penny Lane and many more. You just can't find something on this CD you won't like. The music sounds much smoother, fresher and more energized since when they were released decades ago.<br />With all of the hits the Beatles have had, even the ones not reaching #1, they could very well make a CD with the best of the Beatles' songs that failed to reach the #1 spot, which would make a nice complimentary CD to this one.<br />The booklet for the CD includes the release date for each of the singles in the UK and US, when they reached and were at the #1 spot, and a large variety of pictures of the singles in many different countries around the world.<br />This collection of music on The Beatles &quot;1&quot; CD is AMAZING! 27 #1 singles that you'll listen to over and over remembering the good old days of bands like Led Zeppelin, The Rolling, and of course THE BEATLES.
B00005QXDD|4.0|Tenacious D is the debut album of the acoustic-metal comedy duo who garnered a huge cult with the three, count em, three episodes on HBO.  People have accused the band with being \\"two fat guys who sing about how great they are.\\"  So what if Kyle Gass (\\"KG\\") and Jack Black (\\"JB\\") sing about how great they are?  It's just part of the schtick.  Well, here's the thing.  They can PLAY and SING.  This is an excellent album musically.  Listen to \\"Tribute\\" and \\"Double Team\\" for the musicianship and songwriting skill and then \\"*** Her Gently\\" and \\"Wonderboy\\" for Jack Black's assured vocals.    <br />But yeah, you don't buy Tenacious D to listen to something that's great musically, even if it is.  You listen to it to laugh.  And it really delivers here as well.  The comedy is very very funny in a sly surprising way.  Most of the time, the humor is about sex and poo, and Satanism, and weed smokin'.  But the group doesn't rely on those topics to be funny.  Instead, they take a much more intelligent approach through the performance, clever lyrical phrasing, and the endlessly energetic performance by comic genius Jack Black.
6305127638|5.0|Star Trek First Contact, as a film.<BR>Two is a lucky number.  The second TNG film is nothing short of the second fim with the original series cast.  Very cinematic, with a score that's out of this world!  The Borg could very well be the best enemy next to Khan and his Supermen!  Director Jonathan Frakes had the winning formula, put it all together, and the final product flowed nicely.<br />Star Trek First Contact, as a Trekker.<BR>I can't digest it as a whole.  The Enterprise E, more time travel, and Data getting the most out of the emotion chip are true highlights of the film.  James Cromwell and Afre Woodard are the best 21st century characters I've seen.  But...<BR>How does Picard go from a sensitive man in the TNG episode [I, Borg] to the Terminator, hell bent on revenge?!?  And how is it that through numerous TNG episodes, no queen is mentioned, or even thought of; yet it exists now in First Contact!? And it's recussitating Data?  I dunno, I just dunno.<br />Star Trek First Contact, the DVD.<BR>Two trailers.  Some behind the scenes footage. Remastered score.  Beautiful visual transition.  All in one DVD.  If it hasn't won my full praise in any other category, First Contact wins it here.  <br />Bottom Line - Buy it.  Own it.  Keep it.  Worth it.
B00004U8JU|1.0|OK, the devil posessed me at this very point when I'm writing this. But I''ve always felt this way anyhow.... If no one in the world has said this before, may I be the first.<br />Jurassic Park is one hell of a disaster. Those who made this should be eradicated from earth.  The biggest turkey in cinema history (and let us not forget the giant pelicans too), if you're buying this because of its achievements in special effects and sounds then count yourself as someone who has no clue at all what cinema is about. A film that is simply a waste of time and talent.<br />As for Spielberg voted as the No.1 director in AFI (?)'s Best Director list, are you kidding??
6304798482|3.0|Mexican director Guillermo del Toro has made his American film debut an exciting, old-fashioned monster movie that unapologetically harkens back to the &quot;giant bug&quot; epics of the 1950s.  Genetic engineer Sorvino is part of a team of scientists who concoct a designer predator to combat a virulent disease carried by New York City cockroaches; unfortunately, after three years the cure proves much worse than the affliction.  The film's first half lags slightly, but leads to a slam-bang suspense finale in the bowels of the city subway system.  Impressive special effects and an exceptionally sneaky performance from Charles Dutton.  Director:  Guillermo del Toro.  Cast:  Mira Sorvino, Jeremy Northam, Josh Brolin, Charles Dutton, Giancarlo Giannini, F. Murray Abraham.  Rated R for violence, gore, and profanity.  105 minutes.
B00005T30L|2.0|Clumsily scripted skeleton of a movie with so-so performances. If you've seen the trailers, you've pretty much seen everything you need to. There's not much here. The film itself adds little to what the trailers established. The only well-developed character in the cast is Seymour. The problem with that is that he's obviously a Zwigoff/Crumb self-caricature. His part in the original Ghost World comic book is, as I understand it, quite minor. His far more major role in the movie smells of self-pitying wish-fulfillment on the director's part.<br />There are a few good laughs if you can trudge through the cliched, Daria-like quips which, unfortunately, DO in fact make up 90% of the dialogue between the two girls, and -- equally unfortunately -- serve as a lame substitute for any attempt to actually establish a meaningful (or even interesting) relationship between them. <br />But after Zwigoff's work on the exceptional documentary Crumb, I expected more than \\"a few good laughs,\\" and Ghost World simply doesn't deliver. That so many self-professed non-conformist teens lavish this disappointingly two-dimensional flick with praise speaks volumes about their own gullibility and, perhaps, the degree of their desperation to find entertainment that \\"speaks to them.\\" Poor souls.
6305350205|3.0|Okay.  Star Trek V The Final Frontier is indeed not the best film of its kind.  But... It isn't Star Trek Generations.<br />With the lack of real script, and the lack of Industrial Light &amp; Magic, William Shatner puts together what I would agree to be a spoof of a movie.  Think about it:  A useless mountain climbing scene.  An Enterprise that was not working the way STIV-The Vovage Home's Enterprise was.  A &quot;planet of galactic peace&quot; (where did that come from!?)  God on the other side of the universe, who is just an alien like the rest of us, right?  A Vulcan with emotions (wouldn't that be... a romulan??)  Does this not spell s-p-o-o-f? or at least Mystery Science Theater 3000?<br />As far as the DVD, yeah, it's a good complement.  It brings back a visually better copy of the film (the trailers didn't hurt either.)  Goldsmith's score was excellent.  Other than that...<BR>If you don't mind waiting some months, wait until the Director's Edition, or at least until ILM gets a real hold of it.  Then, it will be a spoof worth buying.
B00001MXXG|5.0|This movie will continue for generations as the funniest movie ever. I loved it! Two great starring roles with Matthew Broderick(Godzilla) and Alan Ruck(Speed, Spin City). The best comedy movie ever, to me anyways! It's about a kid(Matthew Broderick) who fakes being sick and his parents fall for it everytime and skips the day and has a whole lot of fun. But then, his principal starts going after him. It's really funny, watch this!!!!!!!!
B00003CX8U|5.0|Without exageration I have seen this movie over 2500 times. YES 2500!!!! I first saw it on pay tv at the very impressionable age of 16! It was my first weekend home alone and I fell in love! I was already a fan of jazz, classical, drum and bugle corp, rock, hell just a fan of MUSIC! This movie introduced me to dance as well, and a genius. How a wrist flip or an eybrow lift can say so much I will never know. I was dating long legged dancers the next day! Ann Reinking you are a goddess!!! I have worn out 7 copies on VHS...WE NEED THIS ON DVD. The music blends so gracefully with the characters...and the sound editing on the cast reading scene left me speechless. If my life passes before my eyes the way it did for Joe Gideon I hope I die a thousand times!
0316743003|5.0|I'm not particularly an avid reader of military history books or contemporary history books in general, but after a coworker described this book, curiosity got the better of me and I bought it.  I'm glad I did.<br />Ben R. Rich joined the legendary 'Skunk Works' as a young engineer, worked on some of the most secretive military projects in recent history, and later ended up taking over management of Skunk Works.  As a result, perhaps no one else in the world has as much first hand knowledge of these projects, and no one else is better positioned to chronicle some of America's military crown jewels.<br />Rich (and Janos) have crafted a unique book that gives Ben Rich story, with interesting first hand accounts from pilots, air force personnel, and highly placed government officials.  Rich covers the struggles encountered while building various classified aircraft: the U2, SR-71 BlackBird, the stealth fighter, the stealth boat, among others.  He also lightly delves into the darker side of the defense industry: politics, waste, and bureaucracy.  <br />An amazing read, and highly recommended.
B00005JKHP|5.0|First up, the movie, with or without the extra footage, is an okay film.  It's not The Final Spoof, or Generations, but has its own merits.  The beautiful Enterprise refit, an underrated, yet excellent score provided by Jerry Goldsmith, Even the klingons are not bad in this film!  Did I forget Persis Khambatta?!<br />Sure, the storyline was boring and long.  Sure, we all knew Decker wouldn't live through the movie.  Sure, we feel the same way Leonard Nimoy feels about the movie.  But hey, this film is a rarety that truly is Gene Roddenberry fueled.  <br />And, the special edition DVD helped a whole lot.  V'Ger becomes a ship, not just an entity.  More shots of the beautiful new Enterprise.  The score is redone (how about that!)  All in all, it earns my five stars!
B000001FFJ|5.0|Tom does it again.  Armed with only a gravely Luis Armstrong/Bob Dylan type voice and an eclectic musical assortment, Tom creates an album of truely wonderful songs.  Though all of Tom Wait's albums are good in their own way this is the one I would to suggest to some one who has never heard him.  Every time I play this album the people around me are either annoyed or as impressed as I am by this great artist.
B000000WCV|5.0|I bought this CD in 1997, when I was in grade 7. Why? I liked the songs \\"Da Funk\\" and \\"Around the World\\", and the 'popular' people liked it. First listen, I thought it wasn't bad; a bit repititive, but bearable. Now, 4 years later, I've relistned to this CD and I must say it has gotten even better with time! Great acid house beats, infectious riffs, and wonderful samples. Songs like \\"Rollin' and Scratchin'\\" and \\"Rock 'n' Roll\\" are not really immediatly accessable, but are amazing songs! It's like a metal artist went techno! GREAT CD!! <BR>Daftendirekt- 3/5 Interesting sample, cool beat.<BR>WDPK 83.7 fm- 4/5 Really fun short piece.<BR>Revolution 909- 5/5 Quite possibly the best track on the CD!<BR>Da Funk- 4/5 Nice bass riff, great texturing at end.<BR>Phoenix- 5/5 Amazingly weird.<BR>Fresh- 2/5 Annoying.<BR>Around the World- 4/5 Great song to dance to!<BR>Rollin' & Scratchin'- 4.5/5 Take trash and house and mix them together.<BR>Teachers- 4/5 Fun, odd, but still great.<BR>High Fidelity- 5/5 Amazing sample, great synth drums.<BR>Rock'n Roll- 4.5/5 Like R&S; thrashy house.<BR>Oh Yeah- 4/5 Silliness at it's high point.<BR>Burnin- 5/5 My first DP song that I really got into.<BR>Indo Silver Club- 4/5 Great to dance to.<BR>Alive- 3/5 Somewhat annoying.<BR>Funk Ad- 4/5 Sums up the album: creative, fun, silly, great.

B00003CX8J|4.0|I originally did not plan on seeing this movie, but many of my friends told me that it was good, so I finally gave into the peer pressure and saw it.  I'm glad I did, because this movie is great.  I guess the visuals are the real stars of the film, but the actors are still good.  Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellan are great as Proffesor X and Magneto, respectively.  Hugh Jackman's Wolverine is on the mark, and the character Toad (Ray Park) is cool in his own way.  The script is good for the most part, but it does have some clichs, such as Wolverine and Cyclops fighting over Jean Grey, or Storm giving Wolverine a lecture about choosing sides.  Also, a few lines weren't written very well, especially when Storm is about to fry Toad with a lightning bolt.  She says, \\"Do you know what happens to a toad when it's struck by lightning?  The same thing that happens to everything else!\\"  I just don't see the threat.  But all of the jokes were great, my favorite being the \\"Middle Claw\\" with Wolverine.  This is a feast upon the eyes, and is very good for some laughs.
B00005RY7X|5.0|You know what my definition of an amazing song is?  Put a song on at a party and see if people can stand still.  If they can't then it's amazing, in my humble opinion.<br />Other amazing songs to give examples:  Buddy Holly by Weezer, Play That Funky Music by Wild Cherry.<br />Andrew WK has locked into something here.  It's the music everybody wants to hear and loves to sing but nobody plays anymore.<br />Thanks, buys, for giving the people what they want.<br />PARTY HARD!!!!!

B000002KXO|4.0|Most reviews don't rave about this album, but I will.  You can't compare this to Rumours, as we are talking about a different decade.  1982 saw a different sound in music, and this album is representative of that type of commercial sounding music.  Mirage though is still a classic album, and nearly every track is beautiful.  LOVE IN STORE is the opening track and it has a great chorus, a good example of McVie's work.  Buckingham's efforts on the album might be weak but they are still excellent as they are well crafted with strong choruses (eg.  BOOK OF LOVE).  Mirage is my most played Mac album after Rumours - that says something!  HOLD ME is a classic, who could forgot the desert video for it?  There's even a song on the album that reminds me of SONGBIRD - yep, listen to WISH YOU WERE HERE.  Please dont expect another Rumours. Just bear in mind that was recorded in the 70's.  This was recorded in the 80's.  Sounds change!
B00005JKCF|4.0|I have never read a Spider-Man comic, save one written by a friend of mine, and I've only seen a couple episodes of the TV series, but I am now very interested in them.  I was blown away by this film.  The story was great, and the effects were stunning.  I knew enough about Spider-Man's history to know that Sam Raimi didn't screw this film up.  I originally thought that Tobey Maguire, as most people have agreed with, was wrong for the part, until I learned that Spider-Man was a nerdy kid to begin with.  After I saw the movie, I realized that Maguire can play a wide spectrum of characters, and his role as Peter Parker/Spider-Man was great.  Kirsten Dunst was, I thought, good in most ways, but she seemed a little prone to changing her personality.  Willem Dafoe was the best, though.  He perfectly played Norman Osborn/Green Goblin, with the scenes where he's arguing with himself very believable.  He was very creepy, and that made the movie even better.  The only thing that I would have liked to have seen were more fights between Spidy and Gobby.  Altogether, this was an amazing film.<br />P.S.<BR>After 9/11, a scene was removed with a giant spider-web between the World Trade Center towers.  Personally, I would have liked to have seen this in the movie, as kind of a memory or tribute to the WTC.
B000002L9Y|1.0|In 1987 everyone got excited because Fleetwood Mac (FM) had returned to the music scene.  People thought it was their first album since Rumours. But any FM fan knows that MIRAGE was their first 80's album (aside from FM LIVE in 1980),and MIRAGE is a much better album, but sadly overlooked by many.  Now back to TANGO.  What's wrong with it?  All songs are predictable commercial sounding tracks that lack the charm and appeal of their previous work.  If any McVie songs annoyed me, it was the ones on this album.  Weak choruses and songs that seemed to have been written in 5 minutes - 'Little Lies' &amp; 'Everywhere'.  There's also the bland Buckingham tracks 'Family Man' &amp; 'Big Love'.  Nick's 'Seven Wonders' is semi-passable, but like all the reviews said back in 1987 &quot;this album is boring&quot;.  Avoid this album at all costs.
0871137380|5.0|When I purchased this book I had already seen the movie so I wanted to compare the book to the movie see how it is. Well when I started reading I couldn't stop till it was over. The attention to detail and graphic situations makes this book comparable to the best Vietnam books. It gives points of view from both our side and the Miltia that was fighting us. Definitly Reccomended reading.
B00005R1N3|4.0|Black Christmas is a fantastic film upon first viewing.  Very eery and ideal for a cold winters night.  It probably doesn't hold the same appeal on second viewing but that's understandable. To this day, I still don't know who the killer is, because it wasn't revealed.  <BR>DVD EVALUATION:  <BR>There are 2 DVD's floating around.  The first one is the 25th ANNIVERSARY Copy which boasts a digitally remastered print.  The film was never shot in widescreen so you get it in full screen. The 25th Anniversary only contains mono soundtrack, but features wise, includes two interviews with John Saxton, and a theatrical trailer.<br />The second DVD available is the SPECIAL EDITION which came out in late 2002.  The picture quality has been further improved on the 25th Anniversary copy, but is only a marginal difference.  However, they have tried to make it look widescreen by chopping the top and bottom off of the original film and putting black bars. This gives the impression of widescreen, but as mentioned above, the film was originally shot full screen.  The Special Edition boasts a documentary, more interviews, a theatrical trailer, better sound ... and much more.<br />So which copy to get?  If you are a die-hard fan of the film, it's wise to get the 25th ANNIVERSARY copy because you get the full uncropped image of the film.  Sure, all the extras features on the new SPECIAL EDITION are a  bonus, but you can probably live without them.  Like most DVD extras, they often only get looked at once or twice ....
0451191153|5.0|This is a book that every high school kid should have the opportunity to read to better understand the meaning of individualism and it's importance in their lives. <BR>Howard Roark is a character that epitomizes success by doing what is in his heart and mind, and not what society tells him to do.<BR>The Fountainhead is not a book for the weak minded socially concious person who relies on American media for all their information.<BR>Read the Fountainhead if you have the desire to be an independent thinker.

B00004X0ER|5.0|which I, for one, will welcome, if this album is any indication of the likely soundtrack.  Good lyrics, great guitar, and enough feedback-fueled attitude to keep you bouncing through a Nordic winter are the hallmarks of the Hives.  And the CD has three MPEG versions of their videos, to boot, so you can figure out which goofy name goes with the band members photo.  Buy it and play it loud.
B00003CXXO|5.0|This film is definitely not for everyone, and I believe one of the reasons for it being panned so voraciously leads back to poor marketing choices. What the public was given in the ads and trailers led people to believe that this was going to be one of Spielberg's heartwarming &quot;kiddie movies&quot; and/or a Hollywood Blockbuster. Honestly, when I went to see it in the theaters, that's what I was expecting, too. In my case, however, I was pleasantly surprised. But for someone who wouldn't find this type of film their normal cup of tea, the surprise probably would be unpleasant, and people do tend to react to disappointment in a more negative manner. If those people had known what to expect going in, they could have made a more informed decision on whether or not to see this film, causing fewer disappointments, and, I believe, fewer completely negative reviews.<br />As I said, I was pleasantly surprised, because while I certainly don't mind being &quot;entertained,&quot; as most people were expecting of this film, I much prefer to be challenged to think, and this film definitely does that. Yes, it's slow-paced, but if you're the kind of person who gets all tingly with delight at the thought of reading a good long novel, that fact won't put you off a bit. No, it doesn't offer easy answers to the questions it raises, but these are questions there are no easy answers for. And yes, it does seem strange to have the cold cynicism of Kubrick cross-pollenated with the warm sentimentality of Spielberg, but even stranger, it works. The resulting hybrid manages to be pessimistic without being jaded, heartbreaking without being schmaltzy.<br />Haley Joel Osment is astonishing. If he turns in performances like this at his young age, it's amazing to think what he'll be able to do in coming years. And Jude Law's performance is equally as good. Both give performances that allow the audience to identify and sympathize with their characters, while at the same time never letting them forget that those characters aren't &quot;real.&quot; I concur with other reviewers who feel that these two actors were short-changed at Oscar time.<br />The film raises many, many questions, questions that, as I said, are not easily answered. Ultimately, it's about what it means to be human.
B00005V1Z5|1.0|While Ben Stiller can be a hilarous actor, this movie wastes his formidible talents.<br />Stiller plays Derrick Zoolander, the top male model and one of the world's greatest idiots. He was deposed by Hansel (Owen Wilson) in a fashion award show. Meanwhile, he discovers the fashion industry is plotting to assassinate the democratic prime minister of Malaysia.<br />And he's the brainwashed assassin.<br />This movie was loud and obnoxious, the jokes synthetic, and just utterly stupid. The characters are stereotypical and shallow, dialogue weak, and plot thread-bare.<br />In other words, this movie is truly about the fashion industry!
0440133688|4.0|As a second year medical student whose assignment it was to read this book, I had mixed feelings.  Because of all of the other coursework, I was not very excited about the prospects of filling my time with more reading.  I was pleasantly surprised, however, when I found myself unable to stop reading, constantly wondering what was going to happen next.  Although there are some pretty &quot;racy&quot; scenes, to say the least, I thought they were a well thought out portion of the book.  What I did take, however, was the humanness that each of these characters carried with them throughout the book.  Without giving too much away, I saw the pain, the sorrow, the humility and anguish that goes into the medical profession on a daily basis.  We as future physicians are going to have to deal with a lot of &quot;stuff&quot; as we go along, this book gave us a small, entertaining glance at what that may hold.<br />I recommend this book to all readers, preferably for the at least PG-13 and up.  This book will be entertaining and educational for the medical and non-medically inclined.  You won't get bogged down by medical jargon and lingo.  Just sit back and enjoy.  Learn what &quot;TURF'ing&quot; is.
0671027344|5.0|This book is so real, so wonderful, and so touching.<br />At the beginning of the book, the writing style is very simplistic and I guess you could say, not very good. However, as the story unfolds you can see Charlie's (the main character) writing skills develop due in large part to his wonderful English teacher Bill who constantly has him reading and writing essays and reviews. It's wonderful to see his use of the English language progress as it does, and a large part of the story that you don't realize until the end or close to it.<br />One of the things I loved most about this book, was my ability to relate to it; things such as the zine <i>Punk Rocky</i> and The Rocky Horror Picture Show, the making of mixed tapes and giving of gifts. <br />Not only is Charlie a very sensitive young male, but he is very observant and you almost immediately wish you had your own Charlie.<br />All in all, this book is extraordinary, everything about it is perfectly planned, this book is <b>infinite</b>.

B00003CXRM|5.0|This movie was excellent and i'm am getting it on DVD. It has a lot of comedy and the music is very good, although i have never enjoyed before or since.

B000059XYA|4.0|Superman II ties up a subplot from the previous Superman:  The Movie.  Jor-El, Superman's father, banishes three of Krypton's most deplorable citizens into the nightmare plane of the Phantom Zone.  As it turns out, Jor-El did them a big favor, since the three villains are the only ones other than Kal-El (Superman) to survive Krypton's explosion.  Many years later, Superman hurls a terrorist's nuke deep into space where he assumes it will explode harmlessly.  Unfortunately for Superman and the rest of the world, the explosion shatters the Phantom Zone, spilling the exiles from Krypton into space near Earth's yellow sun--which means all three of them automatically acquire the same powers as Superman himself.  The villains hit Earth just as Superman has succumbed to Cupid's arrow and given up his awesome power so he can be with \\"mortal\\" Lois Lane.  Too late, Superman realizes he cannot shirk his responsibilities even for love.  The Krytonian criminals, reveling in their newfound abilities, run amok and make themselves masters of all they survey.  Yet they remain baffled by rumors of Superman, whom the people of Earth insist will save them.  Enter Lex Luthor, who promises to give the super-powered tyrants Superman in exchange for a little beachfront property:  Australia.  Eager for a chance to avenge themselves on the son of Jor-El himself, the criminals agree.<br />Delightful entertainment, Superman II is an action-packed comic book brought to life.  The climactic showdown between Superman and the trio of villains is especially well done, with Superman for the first time having to face down superior odds.  Unfortunately, Richard Lester doesn't match the artistic balance that Richard Donner brought to the first Superman film.  Many of the jokes in Superman II are ill-timed or just totally out of line, so that many otherwise dramatic scenes teeter on the brink of pure camp.  Also, the script inexplicably adds new powers to all the Kryptonians:  now they can project deathrays from their hands and cause amnesia with a kiss.  <br />But even these faults can't ruin an otherwise fantastic picture.  If not quite as good as its predecessor, Superman II is still a charming, exciting winner.
0375703861|3.0|I personally enjoyed the depth of the characters in this book. There were, initially SO MANY characters, but the main ones are definitely memorable. The author has talent for looking deep into a person and writing about them like a cartoon artist would paint them. The book is full of reality: dreams that, once realized, are never as great as we dreamed them up to be --plans that don't go quite right. The author must be quite a pessimist. The book doesn't have a plot that grabs you and makes you continue turning pages. However, the pace speeds up a little bit.  What the book lacks in plot, it makes up for with it's characters.
B00000JGEH|5.0|Arnold Schwarzenegger is perfectly cast as the cold-blooded Terminator is this, the template for all science fiction action movies since.  Though the FX weren't exactly innovative even in 1984, they're good enough to make the futuristic sets and high-octane action scenes more than believable.  But James Cameron's story of heartless cyborg murderers and an expendable humanity isn't built on FX pyrotechnics anyway, and that's why in many ways it compares favorably to its generally bigger and better sequel, Judgment Day.  Cameron and co-scripter/producer Gale Anne Hurd created a story around a skeleton of realistic characters and some clever twists on the traditional time travel plot, which Cameron himself then molded into a masterpiece of cinematic suspense.  Highlights include:  a peak ahead to an apocalyptic future where humans live like rats and cybernetic assassins stalk the earth; a sensitive love scene between the mother-to-be of mankind's eventual savior and her protector; much clever dialogue (\\"Come with me if you want to live,\\" \\"I'll be back,\\" etc.), and a closing shot that turns the traditional riding off into the sunset ending on its head as the female lead drives off down an uncertain road beneath hovering thunderclouds that are harbingers of the nuclear storm to come.  Odds are if you're interested enough to be reading this review, you've probably seen it already--hasn't everybody?  But if somehow you've managed to escape The Terminator this long, don't worry:  HE NEVER STOPS.
B00005YW4H|1.0|After reading all the hype about this new artist, I ran out to get Ms. Jones' debut CD.  I usually purchase about 60-70 CD's per year.  &quot;Come Away With Me&quot; is by far the most boring recording I have purchased in the last five years.  Blessed with an above average voice, Ms. Jones could not have picked more boring material than she did for her debut recording.  This music drags on and absolutely puts me to sleep.  This CD sounds like one continuous song with 15 pauses in it.  There is very little variation from song to song and the musicians play a very uninspired background role. The lyrics are weak and I do not hear the Jazz/blues connection that everyone is writing about.  After multiple listenings, this recording falls somewhere between below average country music and second grade blues  - This one goes into the resale stack.  Don't believe the hype. Save your money and check out Cassandra Wilson and Dianne Reeves - now they will put a smile on your face.
B00005QENZ|5.0|This Aero album carries a lot of baggage with it for me. I remember when this album came out, where I was, and when I first heard it. Not only is every song great, but it also takes me back to memories that nothing else has been able to unlock, and that's a good thing. <br />Cryin, Crazy, Amazing, etc. are all very good, and are classic Aero songs. These are some of my favorites, and Tyler and Perry work wonderfully together, writing some of the best songs I've ever heard. Buy this disc if you don't already have it--it's worth every penny.
630027120X|4.0|The Mission stars Jeremy Irons and Robert DeNiro, but also includes brief performances from Liam Neeson and Aidan Quinn.  The movie is set in the jungles of South America during the late 1700s.  <br />Jeremy Irons is a Jesuit priest trying to convert and protect the indigenous people.  DeNiro is excellent in his portrayal of a hot-blooded slave-trader who has a change of heart.  Together, they will struggle to save the people from takeover by the commercial exploits of the Spanish and Portuguese.<br />The story moves very well, and the scenery is gorgeous.  I believe this film won an Oscar for its cinematography.  The musical score is hauntingly beautiful.  The message is still powerful today.  I would recommend seeing this.
B000005RFQ|5.0|Most people think Black Sabbath was dead after Ozzy left, maybe even after Dio did. Not quite, the remaining 3 members of Sabbath and Ian Gillian of Deep Purple record this masterpiece. The album is very diverse and, like all Sabbath albums has melodies that stay in your head. All songs express different moods and has a story behind it...my favorite being the title track..which reminds me of Deep Purple's Child In Time with Iommi's classic guitar. Disturbing the Priest and Zero The Hero are also favorites... If you don't have it...buy it!! It's Ian Gillian singing for Sabbath in a manner he didn't even approve of after the album was released !! He did it just for the money!! WOW
