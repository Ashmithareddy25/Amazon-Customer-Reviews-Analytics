See. Start moving your pencil to block in the shapes that make up the object as well as the negative space. She asks you to see the composition as a whole, considering the placement of the object with care so that the space around it is almost as interesting as the object itself.
0375869026|5.0|I was searching for summer reading books on Amazon, and saw that this was being recommended for ages 6-8.  I encourage parents and teachers to pre-read this story before handing it over to anyone under the age of 9 to read independently.  There are several &#34;middle school&#34; situations that may not be appropriate for your 1st or 2nd grader.  I definitely recommend this for 4th grade, and read it with my class this year.  It was a transformational reading experience for my students.  In reflecting on our year, every student listed this story as one of their favorites, and my own children (ages 9 and 10) list it as their favorite book of all time!!
1556438850|5.0|I am a newer yoga teacher and I feel so much more confident teaching because of this resource.  Well written, easy to understand full of new information that I have not seen elsewhere, let alone all put together in one book.  I also purchased his Sequencing book which I use with this in planning my classes.  I use this every week!
B005LAIIKI|5.0|Loved it! Great movie, great story line and great acting.  Quentin Tarantino definitely shows his genius with this one.  When I purchased it, the two-disc set as described was only a dollar or two more (at Amazon) than the single regular DVD!
B00005UW2B|5.0|Barshai lets Shostakovich speak for Shostakovich which is powerful enough.  These works let you travel the road of history through the composer's imagination to a greater extent  than any other art form.  The relationship of the conductor with the composer helps to accurately relay the composers thoughts and experiences.  Shostakovich more clearly than most other composers has a profound story to tell and does so powerfully through his music. Incomparable musically, as his music is one of a kind. Other great set performances Haitink and Mrarvinski.
B009FZHYKU|3.0|I like this show but there's too much noise, squishing, panting and hissing of the zombies I mean. I am simply not enjoying it much at this point. Will probably bail at this point.
B00C40DJ1G|4.0|Great composition, instrumental performance, and sound quality (as always).  The vocals are good but not great, which is why I gave 4/5.
B005LAIIKI|5.0|i am so very proud to Owen this it has add to my collection that much more class a great product
B007VYQ9G2|5.0|Abusolutely adorable. Kids to adults like it. Just good educational and entertaining show. Watch it time and time again. FUN
B001AUEMFS|5.0|This is one of my son's favorite songs, so I purchased it for his Kindle, and he has really enjoyed it.
B0014DQSGW|4.0|this movie will entertain and make you laugh.  Sandra and Hugh are very good together - I wish they had kept making movies together.
B0076DCT2G|3.0|This book struck me as though DeMille had written it only to fulfill his contract obligation to the publisher. It didn't seem to have the heart of those leading up to it. I was disappointed. That said the book did have its moments of suspense and humor.
B003QSLW0K|5.0|I love Lilo and Stitch! It's funny and deep enough for adults to be entertained and fun for children to watch. :) AND the story is one of a kind--aliens, Hawaii, and family issues 'cmon people that's pretty unique!
B00DC7N9NS|5.0|I expected this movie to be something along the lines of the new Hansel and Gretel and all the other remade classics that are tortured to suit today's viewing audience.  However, this one was a nice surprise.  The beginning of the movie is a small box format and in black and white like the classic Wizard of Oz.  If you have the patience and appreciation to keep watching, the movie goes to color and full size screen once he reaches Oz.  And the best surprise for me and my family was the content.  It wasn't turned into to a psycho thriller, but was a feel-good family movie where the character grows and learns a life lesson in the end.  It was even sometimes cheesy and corny like the classics which I find endearing.  We thoroughly enjoyed it from start to finish.  It was a breath of fresh air for me and my family.
B001NLKXK2|4.0|this book although sometimes difficult to read is also difficult to put down.  The point of view used made the book an insightful and thought provoking read.  I'd recommend the book very highly.
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|This Clancy book is the first I've read of his in years. I was impressed that the story held my attention as when I first read his early novels. Over time Clancy's books became too long with little need for the extra pages. This book was long, but still kept me in its grip until I was finished. If you've not read Clancy for a while, this book is a good foray back into his story telling.
B008BU75IQ|5.0|I have read just about all of Jeffrey Archer's novels and I am always sad when I have reached the end because the stories are a fascinating read.  Looking forward to the next part of this series.
B002VWNIEA|5.0|This movie was simply phenomenal. The actors absolutely shine in this crime drama thriller; definitely recommend to those who love both crime dramas and thrillers.
B00BGIBVP8|3.0|Funny, but all the really funny parts were in the commercials.  Good movie but more of a rental then a buy.
B004X6PRO6|4.0|The language was well managed but I felt that the plot was a little clunky.  I had to leave the story frequently.
B0058YPILY|5.0|Besides the episodes, package offers behind the scenes information and additional scenes that didn't make it to airtime. Helps me catch up on any episodes I missed.
B0076L9W9Q|5.0|Halestorm has quickly become one of my favorite music artists. I first heard the song &#34;I Miss The Misery&#34; on that Budlight commercial, and I ended up buying the entire album; this band is simply phenomenal.
B00B7PIRIE|4.0|I liked the set except for one faulty disc that \\"skipped\\"  ( disc 1- Season 3 ) and it skipped towards the end of this disc at the part which covered the most long awaited event in this period drama : \\"the wedding of Mary & Matthew\\".  I could only see bits and pieces in this part of the show- disc would not forward or back smoothly enough  for me to see this part of the show.  I was really disappointed as I would like to see this part really well.<br /><br />The rest of the discs were very good.  Thanks for the quick mailing.
B0052RDHTM|5.0|This was a fascinating return to a historical time of great significance to the world. Follet displays his mastery once again drawing in his readers with a vast array of believable characters who stay with you long after the story has ended. Seeing the events leading up to, during and after the war unfold, affect and change the characters from around the globe is a fabulous history lesson, not to be found in any history school books. This is a must read!!!
B00C7KYXHW|5.0|Hannibal. He is cool and creepy.  You know he's bad, but you kind of love him anyway.  This series is amazing. The cast is flawless in their portrayals, and every episode is mesmerizing. I'm so glad I caught up on this one from the start!
B008IJT0CE|5.0|This app has more sounds to sleep to than you can imagine! I love that you can combine sounds! I use it for my daughter when we are traveling and it works every time!
B000FBJFSC|3.0|McCort must have gone through a lot of therapy to be able to tell his story of his childhood.  It is interesting, but depressing.
B002RVCD6O|5.0|Of the eight movies, this and the &#34;Goblet of Fire&#34; are the best.  The latter is more self contained, while this requires a bit of the Potter mythology.
B00BHU2A7I|5.0|The movie was interesting for me as I was a young woman when Psycho was made and was a great fan of Hitchcock movies before and after.  It took me a long time to feel safe in my shower again...I would shoot glances at the curtain to make sure no strange shadows appeared.  Sir Anthony Hopkins was almost eerily perfect in his portrayal of Hitchcock and of course, Helen Mirren always turns in an excellent preformance.  I'm not sure if those who haven't seen that movie or other Hitchcock movies would be as interested as I was.  The ending &#34;epilogue&#34; is so vintage Hitchcokian that I thought the man himselt was doing a cameo.  It was truly priceless.
B00C1BU7V8|2.0|That aside.... This movie bored me to tears. It is long and best suited to a history buff. Maybe i just wasnt in the right mood for it.
B00BY8DNK6|5.0|I dont understand everyones complaint about the sound on this album. Do you realize this concerts is from 1986? It sounds just fine to me. I think people are listening on crapy little boom boxes. Enough about the sound.... This is a fantastic live concert by the late great Ronnie James Dio. Any era of this guys music is powerful. Great song list and Craig Goldy does a great job of stepping in on lead guitar. My sister was at this show and talks about it almost 20 years later. So do yourself a favor and pick up this album. Dont listen to the people that complain about the poor sound. They have no clue what their talking about. Dio's Live in Philly 1986 is a must buy in my book!
0544002318|4.0|Jurek's story is interesting--he was the one person in Born to Run that I wanted to know more about.  I will never been an ultrarunner, but they fascinate me and long have.  Jurek's growth from child to adult is interesting, and well told.  The best part are the recipes he puts at the end of each chapter.  Most of the time they compliment the story, and help me decide if they are for me or not (the lentil burgers I had to make that night!).  The story gets a bit dull as it reaches the present; a bit preachy and repeats the same sentiments he related earlier.  Still, worth the read.
B005MLOKXA|4.0|Watched previously on tv and missed most of the season because there had to be something better on tv.  My husband is the one who most enjoys the references to his home town.  The lawyer characters seem to flat, made up phoney to me with a lot of portrait still close ups to not reveal what?  So why 4 stars?  The plots are intricate enough to keep me involved.  Do they pay actors more for holding those shots and extra few seconds?  You can almost predict when they are coming.  If you are looking for insight into Chicago politics, don't watch this.
B00821OX98|4.0|I think this show has five star potential.... In season one of Lost I would have given it four stars and later given it five stars. I am a hard sci-fi fan and this is everything I love, aliens, alien mechs but most importantly the humans... The characters react what i believe, realistically to their situation. I am not dissapointed and look forward to season 2!
B00C4XYEBW|5.0|This is a killer concert from Judas Priest. It covers all their albums and shows why they are such a fantastic band live. No cookie monster vocals or screamo vocals for these guys. You just get one of the all time best metal vocalist ever Mr Rob Halford. This guy sings with a passion not found in todays heavy metal\\"singers\\" Rob proves why he's the king. Great set list & fantastic guitar playing highlight this concert. If you love Judas Priest or just wanna know how REAL heavy metal is done, then Epitaph is the dvd for you. Buy it you won't be sorry.
B00AQF8CJ0|5.0|I like that it's not timed. So far, levels are pretty easy. I like that you can play repeatedly until you get 3 stars. My eight year old loves it!
B00992CF6W|5.0|0.7.1 has almost everything you ever wanted in minecraft. it has cakes, buckets milk, eggs servers and tonnes more. I really want them to make an update with ender man. But overall I rate it ten stars if I could
B0015DROBO|4.0|Like a lot of other reviewers have commented, this thing is sloooow to start out with.  I probably would have put it down for good if the reviews weren't so strong, to be honest.  But I stuck with it and amazingly enough it became a book that I couldn't put down. There's a very Steinbeck-ian sense of character woven through the thing, and the the mystery was excellent, particularly in the building of the tension between characters.
B00C4YZ12C|5.0|I love these types of games. A lot of fun to run through the levels shooting things. :) Give it a try, I don't think you'll be disappointed.
B003L77G2Y|5.0|What can I say, if you like Fringe this is a must have.  Would recommend to anyone who is a fan of Fringe.
0061950726|5.0|Orphan Train was a page turner that I couldn't put down. It was a very interesting and enlightening story that was well-written. Definitely a 5-star book!
B0071XO8RA|3.0|I was definitely entertained.  I wanted to find out how they finally leave the silos and how they got in t h ere in the first place.
B00CE03UOC|5.0|This game is so addictive I absolutely love it! It could be a little more challenging right out of the gate but its definitely a must have!!
B00AFEXRME|1.0|I normally like movies with Denzel Washington, but this is definitely not one of them.  This movie had profanity and nudity in it just for the sake of putting it there. Bad, shallow plot. I watched it in its' entirety only because I spent money on it. After the plane took a nosedive at the beginning--the entire film went with it. Don't recommend.
B00AJLHUA8|5.0|My girlfriend caught a glimpse of this movie online and got me interested in it. I'm a much bigger horror-fan than she is and I ended up really enjoying this film. The actors are all great and the plot really blew me away. There's a huge twist at the end so if you haven't seen it, stay away from any spoilers.
B0007LXPBI|5.0|The product is clear and free of scratches.I enjoyed the movie from the beginning to the end. I have recommended this product to my friends and acquaintances.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This is an excellent app. We use it alot in Bible study. Different translations we compare. Thank you. 2nd. Timothy 2:15.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|Lovely graphics. Captivating, exciting game. Doesn't get boring. Hours of fun. Love the fact that you can play this game without the internet.
B008Y73940|4.0|solid flick for a rainy day... plot is a bit transparent but what the heck... i need five more words
B00AO2P3GA|5.0|Modern combat is the #1 shootings game I play in my whole life thank u for makings this game for us
B00BWBHIUG|4.0|Love this game. Fun to play but don't understand where my rare fish go! Wish the rare plants would grow quicker and peacekeepers easier to get
B005Q1W10A|5.0|The British seem to know what they are doing.  This is a perfect soap opera with finesse.  I'm looking forward to the next season.
1423136802|4.0|You can't beat the price. Nice set; paperback.  Now if only the audiobook prices would come down.  5 books included
159102594X|5.0|Let's keep this simple.  If you like George R.R. Martin's Song of Ice and Fire series - this is better.
0307476073|5.0|The rugged moors, the dense woods and peat bogs under stormy skies are the setting of this trek taking by a poet.<br />He covers many remote miles and then convenes in a tavern or such at night to read his poems and pass the hat to pay his way. After a journey on the PCT you are ready for WALKING HOME by Simon Armitage.
B001GQSY5U|5.0|I love it! Best animated series I have seen in my life time. Must see and buy this movie great show.
B00992CF6W|1.0|The new update for this is crap! I cant even see my inventory and I cant even mine like I should be able to! Before the update it was awesome but now I'm just dissappointed.
B0064MGU98|5.0|I have followed the series in later seasons and am an enthusiastic fan.  So I am trying to catch up on all the episodes.
1612930832|5.0|The thing I love about this book is it's call for action and sense of urgency. Haanel doesn't hold back many punches in telling us readers that we are responsible for our results and just as importantly, we create the heaven or hell that we live with on Earth. I loved his candor in explaining the subconcious mind's power in helping or hurting your results. I was very appreciative of the style of book as it summarizes important points and reviews the material often. In summary, a great and useful book to help you develop into the great person that is waiting to emerge.
B009XIXVU6|2.0|I read about three quarters of the book and got totally lost and could not get back into it......very, very disappointed.
B00164GDA0|5.0|Stephen King got it right when (paraphrasing here) in the last line of narrative the adult character states:  &#34;.....I never had friends as great as when I was 12 years old...hell....does anyone?&#34;  The movie touches the heart while reminding us of childhood.<br />Especially in the time period which the movie depicts.  (I grew up in that time and nothing can replace my memories of an innocent, happy adolescence of which I was part.  Would that the American children of this day could have been lucky enough to have experienced those times.  So much has been lost....) The film captures a life altering experience of four boys who, in seeking to find the missing body of another boy killed in an accident involving a train, learn many things about each others character and personality.  Over the course of a day trekking over the hills and dales of Southwestern Oregon in the mid to late 1950's (and one memorable night spent around a campfire where a truly engaging and hilarious tale is spun by one of the boys) they seal the bonds of friendship. The dialogue is humorous and affecting as it evokes the remembrance of what it was like to be a boy growing up.<br />  Some language may be offensive to some people, but it is realistic.  If you can get past this, then I believe it is a film that the entire family can enjoy.  Wonderful performances by all....
B004ATSTLY|4.0|Proving that they are no studio over dubbed band.  This performance is raw and delivers the same sound they deliver on their studio releases.
1936594234|5.0|This book is the bedrock and solid foundation for the development of your success conciousness. I've read several books about how to change habits, how to expect more, how to succeed and it's a book like this that is required to explain the \\"cause\\" for your \\"effects\\". A great collection of quotes from the most brillant minds awaits you in these pages (Emerson, William James). I absolutely love Murphy's writing style and candor. This is one book that should be read several times before the true impact can be realized. In summary, get it and read it often.
B00BP4Z8XY|5.0|I liked this movie so much i purchased it after my 48 hour rental time was up, totally worth owning...
B005D9MUWY|5.0|It seems like it knows my thoughts sometimes. I recommend it to all my friends. Makes my business from my phone flow much smoother.
B00CXN2JNS|5.0|Once again Dave Mustaine proves he is still on top of his trade.  The gut wrenching guitar licks are exactly what I expected and Dave and the gang delivered as usual. Thanks for the energy.
B009H442DG|5.0|If you like John Travolta and Olivia Newton John like I do you  will love this CD.  Songs are so cute.
B00D6BQG1W|4.0|This movie was a pretty good movie, i would watch it again, not sure i think its worth owning though.
0545265355|5.0|Brand new. Fast delivery. Ive read one and two I haven't read the last one. Loved them so much decided to buy all three. Recommend these to everyone.
B000UR9T8C|5.0|If you are a Spiderman fan, you will love this movie.  I thought it was well done. I liked it and will view it again sometime.
B0042AEOG0|5.0|This is a year after year collection that I truly love.  You will want to put this in your Christmas collection.
B005LAJ16I|5.0|\\"Homeland\\" is a very well-done program about a POW who has been turned into a mole for terrorists.  The acting is superb, especially the three main characters portrayed by Damian Lewis, Claire Danes, and Mandy Patinkin.  The show is fast paced, suspenseful, and gripping.  It caught my interest from the first episode and didn't let up all season.  Looking forward to Season Two to arrive on DVD!
1439181780|4.0|I've read all of Rhonda's books. This one was great, but I think that The Magic is the most powerful one she's written.
0307720950|5.0|It's a little deep but I did read it at  the beach. Loved it.  was inspired and motivated.  Lots of ideas spinning in my head.
B00ABO609A|4.0|Extremely realistic and authentic study of rocky relationship between a drug-addled lawyer and an artist.  Beautifully done in all departments.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|I enjoyed reading. I was in the Navy during the Vietnam war and this gave enough detail that I felt as if I were there with him.
1451673442|5.0|Absolutely changed my life. I will recommend this book to anyone with an open mind. You won't regret reading this.
B00BCV3HGU|5.0|Will.i.am is an unvelievable artist/musician! I LOVE Black Eyed Peas, so I assumed Will.i.am's solo work would be just as excellent and I was NOT disappointed! This album leans more toward the techno dance genre on certain songs, but they are all great songs. Will.i.am has created some great collaborations on this album. It is difficult to express in words the feeling this album evokes. If you love Black Eyed Peas, you will want this album. It's like a look inside Will.i.am's head, and I like what I se!
B001DUDKEY|5.0|Subtle, brilliantly cast and acted, very true to the novel. I probably watch this one once or twice a year. It doesn't twist or cheat the story the way a more recent adaptation has, and is subtly and deftly acted. The actress who plays sister Elizabeth is a little over the top, but the other actors are all fabulous. I highly recommend this movie.
B00D2K40WY|3.0|Kind of silly, but my 10 year old cousin really enjoyed playing it. So I would recommend it for younger people.
B00AKL1XPU|5.0|By far the best game of its kind I have ever played. I love the diversity of animals so much it's mind blowing. So fun, and entertaining and very well balanced.
B007URVZJ6|5.0|I recommend this book as a valuable resource for any writer interested in properly formatting a book for Kindle Direct Publishing.
B0085YOD1A|5.0|The information provided is useful. It does what I expect. It is easy to use. I will recommend to others.
B00AKKTDJY|5.0|This game is fun and enjoyable. I've always loved diner dash, and this is just a tad different from that. But still very fun!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I just simply love subway suffer!!!! When i first played it remembered me off temple run but this game is far more better.
0307271080|5.0|Adiche's new novel is replete with her usual sophisticated plot building.  This is a very entertaining novel that reminds us of the diversity within the United States as well as the world.
B00COGXX7A|3.0|Enjoyable. Probably would've given 3 1/2 stars if 1/2 star was available. Nothing earth shattering, but an easy watch in typical Nicholas Sparks style.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love Pinterest, so having an app. on my Kindle is very convenient and useful. Definitely should try it if you've never been on!
B00BTHWFBK|5.0|First and foremost like most, I love \\"13\\". I ordered The Deluxe box set with the LPs from the Official Black Sabbath website. I have not listened to the double vinyl.<br /><br />Death Magnetic all over again<br /><br />The CDs are another victim of the volume wars. My hyperacusis hearing does not like the extra HOT sound of 13 at all.<br /><br />Take your normal listening levels and halve them.
B003G4W49C|4.0|I very much enjoyed the premise of the book - a look into the future of how we teach/train/motivate gifted children, and the pitfalls that come along with that. It was a fascinating read and very thought provoking. The reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because I really felt the ending was weak. For all the fast-paced action most of the way, the last chapter just wandered aimlessly.<br /><br />All in all, a definite thumbs up.
B001HNE3NO|5.0|This book was so nice to read. I didn't want it to end. It was a history lesson as well. I was aware of the camps and such but I learned a lot about what really happened. The characters are believable and the story is easy to follow.
B004VSTP4Y|4.0|This was a good series and a good book to end it with. Would definitely recommend this series to those who like the fantasy stuff.
B00957T6X6|2.0|It's nice to get maps from Random House, but going from book to book on Kindle is a pain.  The search function doesn't give you finds from all the books and going from book to book is tedious.  Considering the lousy navigation, it's definitely not worth the price.  And the chapters are numbered without names!!!!!  -- I hated that.  I would have loved to be able to go back and easily find and read all the &#34;Sansa&#34;, chapters-- or all the Jon Snow chapters, etc.  What a disappointment this bundle is.  ;(<br /><br /> Otherwise, it would get 5 stars.  R.R.Martin's writing is darned-near flawless. The Books are great!!!!!  The story is captivating--and it should appeal to most readers, much like Tolkien's saga.  Looking forward to reading Book 6 when it's published.
B0055AUSO8|5.0|The best sandals I ever had!!! I never want to take them off. I'm thinking of getting another pair in case they discontinue them.
B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|This is one of the positive gifts my son uses every single day! Loves the weights, ease of use , design and functionality ! So far so good will update if anything changes
B009KEN87O|3.0|Once you get past a few levels it get a little too hard for me so I stopped playing. But it was fun to begin with.
0345529057|5.0|Gave the set to my husband for Christmas, and he read the books first.  I caught up during his read of Book 4, so I bought myself the Kindle bundle of 5 -- rather than buying Book 4 on Kindle, and Book 5 in paper.  Wish he would have read it faster, and we had hands- on Book 5 to show off on our bookshelf.  &#34;A Song of Ice and Fire&#34; is a world of adventure -- a travelog of Westeros and beyond; and a riveting collection of character studies.  What a story!
B007N31YH0|5.0|Not a bum in the cast, not a fault in the plot, and deserved every Oscar it won!<br /><br />Good quality DVD.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|My expectations were high after reading and loving Slammed and Point of Retreat. I wasn't expecting this book to be so amazing it blew my mind. This is Ms Hoover's best work and a must read.<br /><br />There are so many tiny elements and surprises that made this book incredible that it's hard to write a review without spoilers or giving away important plot information.<br /><br />This book is amazing and emotional and will stop your heart multiple times. The intense connection between Sky and Holder is so deep and passionate, I couldn't get enough of them. Both of them have experienced their share of trials only to come together for their biggest one ever. The events surrounding them test their feelings, trust, and strength and it's beautiful watching them survive it. I haven't stopped thinking about them and their amazing story since this morning when I stayed up past midnight finishing because I couldn't put it down.<br /><br />This is a heavy book with serious issues, not for the faint at heart. You have to trust me when I say it's worth reading!! Absolutely superb writing.<br /><br />There were so many powerful moments and things said that blew me away while reading this book. I can't stress enough how much everyone should READ THIS BOOK.
B004J4WKTW|5.0|This book was so detailed you felt like you were in the story! You could see all the tents it was a awesome book! Loved it:)
B0060FXDCG|5.0|My grandson loved all three.  They are fun, entertaining, and I would recommend them for children.<br />They show children good choices can be made.
B00CE03UOC|5.0|Love it!!!!!!! Easy to play, relaxing and addicting. I love all the flow games and never get tired of replaying them
B00B8WXFWE|5.0|I have been following these guys for years and their music has just gotten better over time.  This is a great album and I love it!  Must have for all NKOTB fans!
B0071XO8RA|3.0|You knew it as a kid - household chores suck. Big time. But you had it easy compared to the world of Wool, where even washing the windows can kill you. Told from the perspective of a revolving door of protagonists, Wool will drop you into an underground world and then leave you there, gasping for air, as you claw your way back to the surface trying to figure out what the hell is going on.<br /><br />Or whether you even care.<br /><br />An interesting enough tale about an interesting enough world, but it never really grabbed me. Maybe it's the fact that the events unfold through a series of short stories, but I found the experience really frustrating. Slow and dark. Each tale focuses on a different protagonist, so there are no people to get deeply engaged with, but the world itself was not clearly enough established for me to give much of a damn about that, either. Ultimately, I got to the middle of the 3rd story (of 5) and got bored enough to wander away in search of something more... engaging.<br /><br />It's very well written, and there may be a big payoff later, but it didn't set the hook deeply enough for me to care to find out.
B004HO6I4W|5.0|My grandchildren and I enjoyed watching this video very much.  We laughed so much.  I would recommend it for family viewing.
B00BLCHL4Y|5.0|In my opinion....this show is far better than Game of Thrones, and it just barley through its first season. Just simply one of the best new shows out there on television.
B0089AD8IO|5.0|My husband got me into this show when we were first dating and i have loved it ever since, its a wonderful show, if you haven't seen it, and don't feel like starting with the original episodes (very old ones), then you should start here. I did, and have never regretted it doctor who is a roller coaster ride that will have you guessing at every turn and eagerly awaiting your next dvd purchase.
B008Y7YH78|5.0|It rocks! Not sure if Jim Carrey was the smartest choice to have play The Riddler (or any Batman character, really), but he didn't ruin the whole movie or anything. Tommy Lee Jones was just fantastic playing Two Face! And Val Kilmer and Chris 'O Donnel made a pretty good pair.
B000JIHP88|5.0|My granddaughter loves this mobile, The night light, the remote, the music and sounds of the rainforest.  We all love that she loves it so much
B00BVMXBVG|5.0|Orphan Black is a truly amazing series.  The premise sounds simple verging on silly when you read it in a program guide (a clone conspiracy), however it's really a fantastic character drama with a vaguely scifi premise.<br /><br />The writing is amazing.  The attention to detail evident is something that you rarely get from a television show.  Characters are consistent, and never feel like plot devices.  Every episode amps up the drama, ending in a cliffhanger and leaving you wanting it to never end. I guarantee that the closing scene of a later first season episode will leave you shocked, horrified, and begging for resolution.<br /><br />At the same time, the show doesn't suffer from Lost-itis: an appropriate amount of the mystery and conspiracy is revealed in each episode in ways that forced, meandering or misdirected.<br /><br />The lead actress (Tatiana Maslany), whom I'd never heard of before, is fantastic.  I'm a cynical consumer of media, and she plays multiple roles with such clarity of character that I honestly forget I'm watching the same woman.  The shared scenes between the clones are where she really gets to shine.<br /><br />Watch this show and watch this actress! Season two is a long wait, so you'll have the time.
B00CUWWLWG|5.0|Very well done. keeps me and the kids occupied for hours. always something new to do and the waiting is not extremely long like other games
B003L77GG0|5.0|Although I am a Christopher Reeves fan for superman Tom Welling did not do bad as the superman in Smallville.  I enjoyed the last season but it left a couple of questions about the other seasons since I was in and out for those but overall I love this last season and I thought they did a great job with wrapping up all the details.
B004JHYRAE|5.0|An excellent guide to, at the very least, introduce you to the terms that will help you navigate a new world of possibilities and potential lifestyle changes.
B002LANLDK|5.0|Had only seen the first Fast and the Furious before seeing Fast & Furious 6.  I enjoyed that so much I decided to watch some of the others to catch up on the story line.  Fast & Furious filled in all the blanks for me!  Enjoyed the music and the action scenes!
B009PNQUXO|4.0|This seems like a good app. But half of the people writing the reviews can't spell! If you can't spell don't write bad reviews on a great app!
159463176X|5.0|I loved this book, I can hardly put him down!!! What a story teller he is-he always makes me cry!!!
B00BJA2VFW|5.0|Playing in Zen Mode is quite relaxing &amp; challenging at the same time. A &quot;must have&quot; for waiting in doctor's offices because you can pick up right where you left off. It's basically a match 3+ game with a twist. If you're looking for a game with a storyline, this isn't it. But it is fun.
B001AQQR2S|4.0|It is a favorite of my kids and seems to be somewhat timeless.  A good mix of fantasy and reality.
B00992CF6W|2.0|I Am really disappointed with what they did if you look at the screen shot num. 1 you'll see that menu ITS NOT LIKE THAT in the update from 6/11/13 till the next update it SUKZ AND when I tried to use the chat it lagged out and crashed my kindle. But on the bright side it's fun and cool and has a new update for chating.
B00C2U6G7C|5.0|Incredible score!  I swear Hans Zimmer just keeps getting better and better!  I get goosebumps every time I listen to it :)
0767812166|5.0|When my grandchildren mentioned they had never seen this movie I ordered it for them immediately. Jeff Bridges delivers one of his most endearing roles as the alien come to earth as a visitor and being shown the ropes by Karen Allen. Don't watch for what will seem dated special effects but for the tenderness between the two of them and the vision of our world through the eyes of an innocent yet wise observer.
B005H9B44A|3.0|Nice special effects and a good story line.  Bouncing between Earth scenes other realms keeps it interesting. Makes for a good movie night.
B001E1GXPA|5.0|In my opinion this is Trivium's best album, never get tired of listening to the songs in this album! Glad i bought it!
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|Great game for kids as well as adults . Fun to play WITH your kids too.<br />You just keep coming back.
0553582038|5.0|It was exactly what I wanted. It matched the first three books of A Song of Ice and Fire that I bought in the States.
B004UHL9EK|5.0|Very useful especially for the very busy lives we live today.  I use it a lot for cooking, when there are multiple pots and pans on the stove along with something in the oven.
B00D6BN9NK|2.0|tried but gave up about 45 mins into the movie.<br />it's not a DIE HARD movie.<br />watch one of the old ones or RED instead.
B005DNPKSQ|5.0|Possibly Jim Carrey's finest performance.  This film explores deep themes about the human existence with an excellent combination of humor and seriousness.
B00BPWDMP2|3.0|Not sure what is happening to lady A but it seems each subsequent album is less fulfilling than the last.
B00CY1JUW2|5.0|This is pure QOTSA sexiness, a hot blast of hard into your earholes. Jump on this quick-style because this is QOTSA at their finest.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This book took me beachside with sunkissed cheeks, sweltering festival trips and a summer love incomparable to any other. Suspenseful and exhilarating, I could not have found a better summer read. I picked this one up on my kindle after giving up on 50 shades for being well over my head and too much to handle. Much preferred Safe Haven on every level!
B003DNN0L2|5.0|This is a quirky but excellent film.  The voices of famous actors add to the charm and the unique style of this witty, entertaining film.
0756407915|4.0|That's right, just read it already!  If you're looking into this book it's because you're interested so just read it.  You've probably already read the first book, so if you like that you'll like this.  'Nuff said.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|I was looking for a relaxing game other than solitaire & found this game. I'm a big Disney movie buff & Finding Me no is 1 of my top favs! ;-) This game is not only fun 2 play, it's interesting, it teaches facts about th underwater world & u get 2 grow plants that live in the ocean. And u get 2 help Nemo & his dad, Marlin, attract his underwater friends as well as others. Old & young alike will absolutely love this game
B004EPYZSK|3.0|I think I will, eventually.  It's rather thin on real plot.  The idea of Aliens having come to/been on Earth back in the 1800s isn't an out of the question idea for a film.  There just isn't a lot of real development of the idea beyond the \\"they're here to take over, use us up,and move on\\" general theme.  And halfway through, most of the mystery is gone from the backstories of various characters.  The aliens attacking the cowboys & Indians reminded me of one of the early scenes in \\"The Time Machine\\" where the Eloi get run down by the galloping creatures.  By then my mind was wandering and I started thinking more about other things the film was like, such as this.
B0095P33IW|5.0|This movie is pure entertainment and lots of fun.  The acting is pretty good and the special effects are great.
B00AK57N00|5.0|I consider this might near the perfect cell phone game.  Just a tap at the right time but it needs your full concentration
B00CVE2N26|5.0|This is an excellent book on Chinese foreign policy, starting with ancient China, working through the 19th century Opium Wars and 20th century China pre-1949 before going into great detail about post 1949 Chinese foreign policy.<br /><br />Dr. Kissinger was actively involved in President Nixon's re-opening of relations with China in 1972 and since leaving the State Department has been deeply involved in studying China as a professor of international relations and a leading advocate of closer ties between the US and China.<br /><br />He has had close contact with the Chinese leadership and his insights into Chinese foreign and domestic policy is based on first hand contact with China's most senior leadership. That makes his insights and analysis interesting and worthwhile reading. I don't agree with all his positions and arguments but his first hand experience of China's leadership over nearly five decades is certainly worthwhile reading.<br /><br />This unabridged audio book version of this book is very well done. The reader has a good voice and good phrasing. For Westerners who are unfamiliar with the actual Chinese pronunciations of Chinese words and names encountered in written media, it's useful to hear a native English speaker giving the correct pronunciations.<br /><br />Overall a very worthwhile audio book. I have a 40 minute highway commute to/from work and I usually pass the time listening to audio books. I thoroughly enjoyed this one.
B00C5W3SBE|4.0|And I agree that Oz is on the lookout for himself just about through the whole film.  But I liked the dark take and prequel view compared to the traditional \\"Wizard of Oz\\" film from 1939.  The latter is really a musical while this film is clearly not.  I can see myself watching this many times even though it won't surprise me as much on subsequent viewings with the prequel story.
B0018OFN1S|5.0|I love this movie so much. Michelle Rodriguez all the way!!! All the fast an furious movies are amazing. Love them.
B000SEI230|5.0|I loved this book. It makes us all realize how precious life Is. I would recommend it to all of my friends. Thank you Nicholas sparks.
B006M4F67A|4.0|I enjoy doing puzzles. So this is alot of fun and helps me unwind from a hectic day at work.
B00B769XB8|4.0|Given reviews I had read about this, I was concerned I'd end up not liking it.  But the previews of it that I saw made me feel I would.  And the idea of a sequel to the basic Hansel and Gretel story intrigued me.  Jeremy Renner somewhat reminds me of a cross between Mark Wahlberg and Daniel Craig with, for the character he plays, a bit of the dark side and comedian thrown in. What also interested me was the human darkness besides the witch threat.  I liked the look of the film and the idea that they avoided a lot of CGI in favor of more traditional effects and animatronics.<br /><br />It is definitely NOT a kids film, though.  Lots of violence and blood, especially the first appearance of the troll.  But, after that, the presence of the troll in the film reminded me of the \\"Labyrinth\\" characters.  Overall, the film had a kind of \\"Van Helsing\\" vibe to it, too.<br /><br />I'll watch it at least another time, or two.  Maybe a \\"4\\" is too much, but I like atmospheric scifi/horror/fantasy.  And I think the sound track's music works well, too.
B00BGIBVRG|4.0|It was a good &#34;Paul Rudd&#34; movie. It had very funny one liners. The story line kind of lacked however I did get a lot of good laughs watching this with my husband. I would watch it again. Pretty funny. :)
B001U0HAYS|5.0|Saw this at a 'drive in movie threatre' back in the 70's became one of my favorite movies. nice to see it on blu ray.
B00957T6X6|5.0|The game of throne is a great way to get away into anothe life and time. Sharing the adventures of all the characters. The writer develops each family and their connection wonderfully. It is truley magical. I'm on the second book now and can't wait to continue to find out how the story continues.
B00A8MGIZG|4.0|I rather liked it once I did straighten out the different stories being weaved in an out and seeing the thread(s) that tied them, thematically, together.  So I'm surely going to watch this again a few times.  I ended up liking the switching back and forth between stories.  I do admit I started watching this on a plane ride and gave up.  However, the environment on the plane (including the tiny screen) was not conducive to concentration and thought.  (I had a better time with \\"Life of Pi\\" on a plane because, at least, the story is nice and linear for the most part.  However, watching this film at home was also much better.)<br /><br />I will say that I thought about a \\"3\\" for this, but, since I would watch it again and again at least a few times and admire the design, I gave it a \\"4\\".
B005LAIIJY|4.0|GREAT MOVIE - THE BLOOD SHED WAS A BIT MUCH THOUGH. VERY FUNNY AT TIMES AND VERY ENTERTAINING. STILL TRYING TO GET USED TO JAMIE FOXX BEING A TOUGH GUY.
B008UCJ7KO|3.0|I'm very disappointed to discover that even part three of the Crossfire books does not equal a finished story. By the time we've all purchased the final \\"chapter\\" it will have proven to be quite costly. At least $40 ...or will we have to wait for a fifth or a sixth to have at least one of the stories angst riddled story lines resolved? That to me is the difference between novels like this with recurring characters and other authors that follow characters from book to book. They don't leave us hanging with sooo many important plot points in limbo. Also, I love the lovin in the Crossfire books, but could we please have a little less anal sex. We get it. Every little part of them belongs to the other.
B00C1BU7V8|4.0|As with any Steven Spielberg movie, Lincoln is a well crafted, well told, cinema-graphic masterpiece. The dialogue is excellent and the acting superb at portraying the tension of being President of a country at war with itself and with its ideologies keeping you glued to the screen. However, if you are looking for the Scripture quoting, God fearing Lincoln described in most Lincoln biographies, you will be disappointed. Not surprisingly Spielberg has sanitized all but a small portion of Lincoln's frequent references to God, the Bible, and prayer. For example, instead of seeing Lincoln call upon his cabinet to pray or the President prostrate before his fireplace as he cries out to God for guidance, you wonder if Lincoln is an old man falling asleep as he bows his head and closes his eyes from time to time.<br /><br />This is a very good movie and it is a solid, but somewhat fictionalized, account of history. But make no mistake, Lincoln has also been sanitized and crafted to send certain specific politically correct messages to its audience.
B00AS1Q93S|3.0|I did and I'd watch it again even knowing how things evolve and uncover.  Admittedly, Jack Reacher is a character who makes up his mind about things and, as is said about him near the end of the film, doesn't care about the law, etc.  So he does some unheroic things because he judges his adversaries and carries out punishment as he sees fit.  On one hand, he's a Dirty Harry kind of guy, but, on the other, he is a perceptive investigator.  And the plot \\"secrets\\" aren't that obvious, though you kind of know they are there from relatively early in the film.  But seeing \\"facts\\" of the situation explained was of interest.  So I don't think this is a terrible movie by any means.
B00081U7HC|5.0|THIS IS MY FAVORITE MOVIE EVER. THE MORAL AND THE ACTORS ARE GREAT. I WOULD RECOMMEND THAT EVERYBODY SEE THIS MOVIE AT LEAST TWICE IN THEIR LIFETIME. I WATCH AS OFTEN AS POSSIBLE. LOVE IT!!!

B007SGM084|5.0|I love this series. Such a great buy for the kindle. I have only  read the series once but, I can't wait to read it again!
B004JN1D2I|4.0|I got this because of the tv show.  I first heard about this book a long time ago and wish I would have read it first.  The writing is very well done.  One thing I really like is that every &#34;chapter&#34; is from a new view point.  You don't read 5 chapters from the same character in a row.  It will go back in forth between characters each chapter.  The only thing I don't like about this &#34;bundle&#34; is that all four books are combined into one book.  So on my tablet it says I'm 6% done that is 6% done of all four books, not 6% done of book one.  I would have liked if this was four separate books but its not that big of a deal.
0440423228|5.0|I love he Game of Throne series, so I had to have this! The quality of the art work is excellent.the parts of the story that are high lighted seem to be just right! It's a great other way to read the books!

B00AM7E4LM|5.0|This is a very particular book about a very particular topic: skill acquisition.<br />As soon as I saw Josh was going to publish a new book about this (almost mysterious) topic, I immediately knew it was going to be great. Just as his past book, The Personal MBA.<br /><br />As soon as you start reading the book, you will be surprised, as this book is not what you expect it is. But wait, that's not a bad thing. In fact, that's great.<br /><br />Instead of explaining the psycological side of skill acquisition, or instead of showing you some random scientific studies about the topic (as almost any other book on the topic has done), he starts right off the bat with the method he used to acquire 6 skills: yoga, programming, touch typing, go, ukulele and windsurfing.<br />Yes, quite random skills, you may think. But that's also great. Why? Because you can extrapolate many of the principles of how he learned those skills to similar skills.<br /><br />For example, if you want to learn a martial art, you may see a lot of similarities with the windsurfing experience he had.<br />If you want to learn how to program any language, you can almost copy paste what he did to learn Ruby.<br />If you want to learn how to play a new instrument, the same applies.<br /><br />The book can be separated in two parts: at the beginning, he shows you with no fluff the 10 principles of rapid skill acquisition, and the 10 principles of effective learning. Even though he explains the 10 principles quite fast, don't worry, there's not many more things to talk about about those principles.<br />Then, in the second part, he starts to explain how he learned all those 6 skills.<br /><br />The big advantage of this book is that you will learn at firsthand how you can also learn almost any skill you want.<br /><br />The big disadvantage this book has is that he goes to explain each skill quite deeply. You will get kinda bored with many of the things he explains, but hey, if you are as curious as me, you will still enjoy it (it's very interesting to know how Go and Yoga were developed).<br /><br />So you may not see many golden nuggets throughout the book as you may expect. What you will get is the \\"idea\\" of how you can learn anything just by applying a very specific and simple method.<br /><br />This book can be summarized using the Pareto Law: the 20% of this book will teach you everything you need to know about skill acquisition; the other 80% just proves it.will still enjoy it (it's very interesting to know how Go and Yoga were developed).<br /><br />So you may not see many golden nuggets throughout the book as you may expect.

B000063UR1|5.0|5 Stars = Masterpiece<br /><br />A criminally overlooked sci-fi film from 1972. A profound beautifully sad & quiet film, that poses the question, is nature worth saving from a barren impotent Earth?<br /><br />A story of one man's reverence for all things living, fleshed out in a genuinely moving film! Bruce Dern is excellent as the botanists who takes care of his environmental domes filled with plants & animals in outer space from Earth, the last of their kind. The crew gets a message to blow up the domes & Dern wants to save what's left of the Earth's natural fauna & flora, or forever be lost. His robots assistants, Dewy, Huey, & Louie, are direct predecessors to \\"Star Wars,\\" C3P0 & R2D2. You become enamored with them, as they fulfill emptiness of Dern's heart, & become his companions & allies in his quest, as the three work fastidiously to maintain their dome. Truly a labor of love.<br /><br />For sci-fi lovers that are not looking for a space opera or aliens threatening mankind, for mankind is the alien here, & he threatens his own existence with his blind & willing ignorance. A grand statement of a film that may be the future of our reality.
B00ADQCBEY|5.0|One of the best series out there.  Great acting, direction, and writing.  Definitely worth watching.  The creators are not afraid to stick their necks out and tell the truth.

B008UCJ7KO|2.0|I was so disappointed in this book. I Loved the first two and was so excited about this one but it is horrible.  Way too much sex, no plot line, introduction of items that add no value to the book.  I loved both characters I. The first two books but I finished this book really disliking Eva.  She is a spoiled, selfish brat. Really hate that this was such a bad book.
0743554450|3.0|In A Thousand Splendid Suns author Khaled Hosseini again gifts us with a story of his native Afghanistan told in his lyrical style.  It's a setting not many write about (at least not in the American market) and so it is fresh and interesting territory for the reader.<br /><br />A Thousand Splendid Suns is the story of two women and their unlikely friendship, spanning from the late 1960s/early 1970s to the early 2000s.  Those were turbulent decades for this mid-eastern nation (which changed names several times during the course of the book) and so this is really more a novel about Afghanistan than anything else.<br /><br />Although A Thousand Splendid Suns lacks the disturbing darkness and gritty realism of The Kite Runner (Hosseini's first book, for those two or three of you who haven't heard of it or read it), it also lacks the power of The Kite Runner.  Although The Kite Runner was hard for me to get through in places, it was an original and unpredictable storyline.  This book, on the other hand, follows a much more familiar and often-used plot -- two ill-used and abused women who are united in their mutual suffering into a powerful bond of friendship.  There were places where the story almost felt cliche (I won't say where, as that would be a spoiler for anyone who hasn't yet read it).<br /><br />The book starts out fairly strong, then in the middle -- after the two women are returned to their husband -- it begins to break down and become disjointed.  For instance, the author will follow a scene where Rashid has brutally abused one of his wives, with a scene where they are all together in almost camaraderie.  Often several years are skipped from one scene to the next, adding to the disconnected feeling.  As I was listening I thought that perhaps this was due to a poor abridgement, but looked at the cover and saw that this is an unabridged version.  Towards the end the author seems to pull it together and the story flows more smoothly and coherently.  (Although for some reason in the very last part he switches to the present tense, which I hate).<br /><br />The narrator, too, was perhaps not the best choice.  Although she is obviously a native Afghan speaker and her accent lends a tone of authenticity to the story, her style was flat and monotone.  Someone with more dramatic skill could have made the story come much more alive.<br /><br />The main takeaway for me from this book is that it is very unpleasant and difficult being a woman in Afghanistan.  All in all this is a good book but not a great one.  I can recommend it as an enjoyable read, but not one that is going to linger all that long in your mind.r some reason in the very last part he switches to the present tense, which I hate).<br /><br />The narrator, too, was perhaps not the best choice.

0307744434|5.0|Absolutely loved this book!!!!  I do, however, recommend reading a copy that is not electronic because I kept wanting to go back to match up dates--I ended up with pages of notes as I tried to keep things clear and be able to check back. There are 3 complete and separate plot lines all interacting through the Night Circus.  It is a world I would be delighted to visit and play in. If you like fantasy and/or stories about the late 1800s/early 1900s, DO read this book!

B000XUBFE2|5.0|TBF rates as one of my favorite ten books . . .ever.  I recommend it to strangers and friends alike.  As I read it, the book struck me as a remake of Anne of Green Gables:  displaced plucky girl, cranky/affectionate step mom, kindly Heidi's grandfather-type step father, step mom's angry nemesis, problematic (aren't we all!!!) BF.  And yet the book explores this structure with an insight into human nature that's all its own.<br /><br />I loved Death’s narration.  He alone is worth the price of admission.  He writes in haiku flashes.<br /><br /> Two truths got underscored for me.<br /><br />One, crises don't build character, they reveal it.  Whether one sees the revelation in a sudden burst of light as step mom responds protectively to the Jew–(Warning:  I cannot remember ANY names, ANY NAMES AT ALL ANY WHERE AT NO TIME.  I struggle everywhere with this malady and I mean no disrespect in replacing proper names with descriptors.)–or in stages, as our heroine increasingly resists her country's political structure, we see character revealed, not formed.<br /><br />Two:  Sociologist Zimbardo says, &#34;bad systems create bad institutions which create bad situations which incite bad apples who behave badly.&#34;  Whole civilized nation succumbs to this truism and burns their neighbors in gas ovens, thinking they please God and the Fatherland.  TBF shows this process at ground level, where the evil metastasizes into the swollen lump even the untrained eye can identify as cancer.<br /><br />I cried.  I read through meals, dripping sauce on my defenseless Kindle.  I emailed friends with my enthusiasms.  I annoyed my wife with insistent demands that she read this thing.  My 92 year old mom read it (complained about how everybody seemed to swear in the book but otherwise . . .).<br /><br />Last thought.  TBF makes a splendid WWII-from-the-POV-of-those-who-suffer trilogy with &#34;Milkweeds&#34; and &#34;Painted Bird&#34; .  If you have some residual sense of hopefulness amidst our own gathering civil storms, DO NOT READ PB.  If you are currently on anti depressants, do not read PB.  I read PB years ago and suffered moroseness beyond bearing. I find that Milkweeds and TBF make a wonderful antidote to the powerful imagery of PB.  Nevertheless, they all three belong together in my mind.
0345803485|5.0|I had NO idea what this book was about when I ordered it. I was pleasantly surprised by it's content. I look forward to ordering the next book soon.
B005LAII4E|5.0|G.I. Joe: Retaliation (Blu-ray / DVD / Digital Copy +UltraViolet) is a great movie to have. It is better than the first one.
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|I was little disappointed with this book.  I was looking forward to all of the power plays between Gideon and Eva.  Don't get me wrong, I liked the new confidence they have in the relationship but it was mellow.  Something was missing.<br />I'm looking forward to the next novel hoping to get a little more of the intensity back.
B003P2WO5E|5.0|Best series since steven ericksons book of the malazans series. Book 1 was absolutely addicting. i can't wait for book 2. fantastic read.
B009X01D9U|5.0|Bought this case because the reviews were exceptional. My husband really likes it<br />Marware has really taken cases to a creative and innovative way for the customer.<br />From the sleek look to the colors of your choice,not to mention the well thought out comfort<br />During usage.  You cannot go wrong with this purchase. Thanks Marware!!!
B00BI73CVI|4.0|I enjoyed this movie very much. Anne Hathaway and Hugh Jackman were magnificent. My only complaint is that it was too long. I got fidgety.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|Fun. Played it on iPod touch and finally got on kindle fire great game to pass time with I would pay money for it
B005DJREGQ|5.0|found the show entertaining and got hooked on it. takes me back to the days of watching Degrassi Jr High.

B008KP6ENE|4.0|paper Monsters is a good game. its no super mario but it tries and honestly it almost gets there. I downloaded this as the free app of the day but this app is probably worth 5 bucks. Would love to see them really flesh out the game and make it available on xbox live or psn.<br />this was the first game i downloaded for my new cell phone and have not felt the need to go back and reinstall any of my old games.<br /><br />If you like platformers in the vein of super mario world then give this a try.
1616202416|5.0|Excellent Book to Read<br /><br />Adichie is a fabulous writer telling an important story to be read.  I highly recommend it to everyone!
B004DNWPY4|4.0|Stanley does a great job explaining how most millionaires are built from certain financial habits rather than inheritance. Translating real stats into easy-to-understand dialog, he shows how many millionaires are hidden by their average appearance.. and better yet, how you can obtain the same results if you follow their example.
B00AALHW6Y|5.0|This was a gift for my fiance.  He is a big Darius Rucker fan and really enjoys the entire cd.  It has an old school county sound.  Good buy.
B008HK3XOU|3.0|The case doesn't hold the Kindle Fire HD securely in various positions for angled viewing and typing as the video describes. It keeps slipping... and therefore not easy to type on device.
B00BGD8CFK|5.0|Very sleek, so very easy to afix, and the color is perfect! Shipping was speedy, too... what else can I say? Would definitely recommend it!
B00CH87HF4|5.0|This game is absolutely insane. I can't believe that this game was free! The graphics are very good for a free game. The controls are a little annoying at times, but are still very simple and easy to use. It seems that Gameloft really put a lot of time into this. I definitely recommend this to title to any RPG or Adventure genre player. It does take nearly a GIG of space though, but with a KFHD it shouldn't take too long.
B007REV4YI|5.0|Daniel Craig fits the roll perfectly.  This and Casino Royale are incredible.  You should also check out Layer Cake, another Daniel Craig knockout.
B00BAVCD8A|5.0|This cd is so good that my son let me listen to it with him and asked me to buy concert tickets in September to see them live in San Francisco!  We both love music, and it is &#34;bonding&#34; that we found a group we can enjoy together!
B0053TWVBO|3.0|Like SO many films based on Stephen King short stories, this movie left more questions than answers.  Hopefully the sequels delve into that.  The acting & filming feels dated. But it kept me interested enough to order the collection of sequels (Parts 2 through 7). Also, no need to order the Blu-ray when the DVD is cheaper and almost looks the same.
B004W1GCNC|3.0|There was little substance or depth to most of the characters.  They were boring.  It  didn't hold my interest enough to finish the series.
B002DQLGHU|4.0|movie is pretty good. liked the book better. think the characters in movie are exactly like described in book. liked it
B00005N6KG|2.0|Even after setting my iPod to have \\"treble reduced\\" and \\"bass increased\\" these things still sound tinny compared to my last pair. The cord is too short for me to connect to anything in my pocket (I'm 6'2\\" but other headsets don't seem to have this issue.) I guess you get what you pay for.
B003U21TBO|5.0|Doctor Who Season 5, Ep. 10 \\"Vincent and the Doctor has to be the best one so far!! A real treat to watch!
B004ELSDZK|3.0|Totemo HD is a simple yet challenging puzzle game. The story line is a nice added touch. At first it is a little confusing
B00COGXX7A|5.0|It was very true to the book.  I could relate to the characters in the movie.  I love Josh Duhamel and I thought Julianne Hough played the part well. It was a very enjoyable movie, with a great ending.
B000X2H8G4|3.0|If you're deaf and you're looking for something to replace a hearing aid, I don't think you're going to find it cheap. I am not deaf. If you do have hearing problems, you need to go to the doctor and stop looking for the cheap way out. This product isn't the best, although it works... somewhat. Yes, it picks up the voices better in the movie, which is exactly what I needed, although yes, it also picks up surrounding noise. The battery life is excellent. I'm still using my original battery.
B00BIVN82M|5.0|One of the best voices anywhere that can fit all types of music. You won't be disappointed with this cd.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|I have played here, I have played there, I have played everywhere. I have also played in a house with a mouse and with a fox in a box. It is a great game with all sorts of unlockables. I also enjoy how you can customize the cars you unlock. the only thing wrong is that the diesel is terrible on gas. and even though you can upgrade gas consumption it really doesn't help.
B004FWXHS6|5.0|I enjoy anything that ryan gosling is in,  He is a great actor and in this movie he really made you feel that he was really a disturbed young man..
B009FZHYKU|5.0|brilliant, most terrifying hour on tv, i appreciate great writing. this show has it all and you better not get attached to any of the characters.
B0017O1MIM|5.0|As of today 688 reviews have been posted on Amazon for this movie. So why add to the heap?<br />Having seen David Lean's treatment of T.E. Lawrence twice theatrically, as well as having pored through every single extra in the the set, I have come up with the following decision points for those considering whether or not to purchase the LAWRENCE Blu-Ray Gift Set, generally selling for $60 and up:<br /><br />As a starting point for those who have never seen the movie, I recommend streaming it first on the largest possible screen to whet your appetite for this epic experience. An alternative would be to rent the recent 4K Blu-Ray restored version. Do not settle for anything less.<br />Assuming it's your cup of tea, you may with to weigh the following exclusives in the box set:<br />The 88-page coffee-table commemorative book is the best I've ever seen for a feature film. Lavishly illustrated and incisively written, it's a keeper.<br />One key Gift Set exclusive entails a Never-Before Released Deleted Scene, which boils down to a longer version of the balcony scene toward the latter part of the film. It's easy to see why it got cut; it's generally dull and doesn't offer much more insight into the \\"enigma inside of a riddle\\" title character than has already been conveyed. Editor Anne V. Coates, who won an Oscar for her peerless work on this film, offers a nice commentary though.<br />Extras involving lavish praise by industry talking heads are pretty much what you'd expect. LAWRENCE is, after all, commonly regarded as one of the cinema's premiere achievements.<br />One feature, however, really stands out. And it is what prompted me to write this review. Simply captioned \\"In Love with the Desert,\\" it is a nostalgic visit back to the 1962 film locations. Filmed in Y2K, this hour-and-a-half documentary is hosted by a man who humbly introduces himself as \\"Eddie Fowlie, property master and a few other things.\\" What you are not told is that Fowlie was the perfectionistic director's right-hand man,working beside Lean on every one of his films beginning with THE BRIDGE ON THE RIVER KWAI. According to Lean's biographer Kevin Brownlow, \\"he was arguably Lean's closest friend\\" and an indispensable part of all his epics. There is no other person who could have given such moving and compelling insights. Great stories about the tribulations and glory of what it was like to be a part of this once-in-a-lifetime motion picture come vividly to life. His entertaining behind-the-scenes anecdotes include an amusing tale of two donkeys humping in the middle of a take, necessitating an expensive cast-of-thousands do-over (for which Eddie took the rap!); redesigning John Box and Dario Simoni's Oscar-winning sets at the last minute; corralling 300 gypsies to remove thousand of bushes and greenery to make Spain look more like a desert; and sending colored powder into a fan to give the Jordanian desert some foreground color. Fowlie, who passed away in 2011 at 89, did it all--and then some--for the legendary taskmaster.<br />Unlike most Box Sets loaded with extras, there is not a huge amount of repetition. With the exception of the various trailers and the two versions of the featurette \\"Wind, Sand and Star,\\" each adds elements the others to not. The enhanced Picture-in-Graphics Track may not be the most user-friendly, as other reviewers have noted, but it is filled with interesting trivia and is very enlightening as far as what was fact and what was fiction about the film.<br />All of the special features include subtitles in English as well as a number of other languages.<br /><br />If you feel the above-mentioned points are worth shelling out the extra bucks for, by all means buy this set. You won't be disappointed.
B0094BB4TW|4.0|Whatever you can do on facebook from the computer you can do on here from your phone. except the games. sorry Farmville lovers.
B00ABGEFWC|3.0|Well my 3yr old daughter liked this game at first.  The graphics are great and the pets are cute... Then we found out there are very many things that require money. It's difficult to explain why she can't have the pets or houses she really wants. The best things in the game cost bling which costs money.
B00821PCJS|5.0|at first glance it appears to be a bit hokey, but the writing is good, the characters are solid and i would say i enjoy this as much as i enjoy walking dead. my wife was hooked after 2 episodes and we will be buying the 2nd season.
B004UID2LC|2.0|It's so darn bad 9:( but if you want real get vtube free you get a real you tube:( and vtube has catogorys
B0066WJLU6|4.0|This Flashlight is cool because you can dim the light. But you also have two light sources! The flash from your camera and your screen. What is cool about the screen light Is that you can change the color on it to glow whatever you want. though not as bright it gives a broader view
B0085YOD1A|5.0|I love that it shows the hours that are left. Easy to read and use. Glad I downloaded this app.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Good book  to read! Enjoy them. Some parts had my jaw hanging and some made me sad! Wish there was another to read.
B000K8EQ5W|5.0|Very deep and moving , really made you think about things ........... just love this.  Would highly recommend, could watch over and over.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|It is very easy give or take a few puzzles. And it is very addicting. luckily there are plenty of puzzles to keep you busy awhile. hundreds of puzzles actually.
B005MMJ84K|5.0|This book was soooooo suspenseful and good.... I loved how Lauren Oliver kept it suspenseful and at the end, SUCH a good cliffhanger!!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Amazing game! You should get this game. It is really fun game. A good game!  It has an amazing graphics.
B00AB7HESI|3.0|I bought the full version when I tried to get on itthw next day they were deleted it even said that I bot it but itwont let me play plz fix this problem I love the game but it wont work right...
B0052RDHTM|5.0|I love stories of fiction based on fact. Familes that are from different countries during period of crises. I love the way the author entwined the characters into each other's lives. I couldn't wait to get to the next book.
0807014273|4.0|There were things that i did not know about the author.  i did not know that he was in a concentration camp.  i love history books!
B0094BB4TW|1.0|Totally trash. Dont ever upgrade this new. If you already upgraded, than just go apkmania.com and download apk file of previous version.
B0078X2LKY|5.0|Very entertaining for my two year old who followed along and laughed  highly recommended to other parents with little children
B008JJM88Q|4.0|This is an updated version of 20 questions as the computer tries to guess any person (and a number of non-humans), real or fictional. The search program is surprisingly sophisticated and able to hone in on most well known celebrities fairly easily. I was able to stump it a fair amount of the time with obscure people, but I'm still impressed with its overall sophistication.
B00BP4ZNFM|5.0|I can't believe I lived half my life before watching this movie.  We rented it for my 9-year-old son to see, as he is a quiet child similar to the boy in the film.  This is a gorgeous story of friendship, loyalty, and family.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This is a great game it's almost like minecraft  the real game but they need to add way not like Redstone or caves.
B00B7G3NFU|5.0|What a movie!<br />It a fun movie to watch, and it brings such a healthy concept into our society! Make you think.
B00280LYIM|5.0|5 stars<br /><br />So great! From nail biter scenes to<br />laugh-your-head-off humor! I love this book and would suggest it too almost anyone!
B009AMAGXK|5.0|While the book was much better, the movie, while not following the book exactly (didn't expect it to) was close to the book and much closer than some I have seen. The actors did a great job, the location selected was what I expected and all in all it was good for what was intended. A love-supernatural story.
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|This book had a gazillion sex scenes, and no story line.  Eva wakes up, eats lunch with someone, has sex, still loves Gideon with a perfect bod, worries about Cary and someone in her family, works out, goes to bed, and repeats - over and over. Even her marriage is only a little blip in this routine.  Boring diary with no conclusion.
B0097HSS4M|5.0|It's a cool app. I have another app where I can edit pictures, and it isn't nearly as cool as this one. I'd definitely recommend it to friends.
B0083Z614S|5.0|The book is very good for ages of 6-10. I would recommend this book to good readers. May God bless America.
B00C7O8TSM|4.0|Was able to see the concert in Vegas - this does well with a lot of the songs except Mike sounds like he has a cold on many of the tracks. We did not get to hear Bruce sing Disney Girls in Vegas as he had a cold - is good it is on the CD set - John Cowsill's drumming is not Denny, but is strong. David's guitar never gets close to Carl's licks.<br />I agree with the comments re the songs being left out, but overall, they are good CDs.
B001F0VHEM|5.0|Pink is creative and I bought it to support her!! Her performance at the ??Oscars, which ever it was -- fantastic!!!  creative !!! She's got spunk!
B004TI5N38|1.0|I'm surprised the author was allowed to publish this book seeing as how the main character is a direct copy (although not even a good one) of Jack Reacher!
B00A0SMTXS|4.0|I liked this one. It was entertaining. The references to the old movie were funny too. Like the lady in the scanner being the same one from the old movie.
B00AKKGX4W|5.0|This was a great read.  I read the prequel, but, it was some time ago so it took me a while to remember who all the players were.  The language at times was a little too up to date, but other than that, I really don't have any complaint to make.  I loved the characters, and the way you had to spend time with them to get to know them.  There were a few twists I did not see coming, but I think it is more entertaining when an author can actually surprise me. I have to say, though, that the train ride with Robert, Minnie, Violet and Sebastian had me laughing out loud.  I look forward to Sebastian's story.  Sometimes I want a mindless beach read, sometimes I want something that will reach out and grab me emotionally and also make me think.  That is what this was.  I look forward to the rest of the series.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|Into it from the start. Found it a bit confusing keeping track of the family lineage but well worth doing. Everyone I recommended it to has loved it also.
B00BSWMITK|5.0|Love seeing how Satch interacts with the other live musicians.<br />Must for Satch fans!! Definitely go see him LIVE if you can.
B00371QQ0M|1.0|just so everyone knows this is the short version of the movie. It takes a long time to load. The pause button (X) doesn't work with my PS3. I had to bring up the whole menu to pause it. The \\"blue ray\\" quality video comes and goes. Some scenes are very sharp. Other scenes remind me of a bad VHS tape. The opening credits has what looks like dirt or scratches in the image like film sometimes gets. Very disappointing.
B00CL68QVQ|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie; the entire cast are perfect for their part.  The first 20 minutes doesn't quite pull you in but all is well by the time its over.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|The book starts off pretty slowly with the main character in prison and attempting to made a deal with the Feds to get out.  However, once it does take off, it is compelling.  I couldn't put it down when the roller coaster ride started down the slope.  The end is such a surprise that it made me laugh.  Grisham is a fine storyteller.  I thoroughly enjoyed the movies made from his books, and now I'm going to read the books that haven't been made into movies.  He really knows how to spin a tale that seems perfectly believable.  When the credits at end of the book said it was a fictional account, I found that hard to take in.<br /><br />Read this book.  You will be gripped and entertained and taken for a ride.
B00COHIFQS|1.0|The mix of hipster imaging and cgi was a sad display. I found myself making fun of the movie at every scene. This could have been a great movie.
B0037KMHRY|5.0|I got this cd for my boyfriend for his birthday and he love it. I do as well it is very well put together and every single song is a good one. It is not lyrical it is just for the most part sound effects but it is so awesome and a very good listen!! You won't be disappointed.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I enjoyed the third book in the Crossfire novels just disappointed how it ended.  I wanted more to read.  Can't wait for the next book to come out.
B007EECSFA|4.0|This is an excellent story.  It has a lot of twists and turns, will keep you reading until the surprise ending.  The journey is worth getting to the climax.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|It was a really good book, but I got confused at the start of the book. Other than that it was a good book
B008UCJ7KO|3.0|I LOVE EVA AND GIDEON RELATIONSHIP IT NEEDED A BETTER ENDING I WAS LEFT HANGING AND ITS A FIVE PART SERIES !!! I CANT WAIT FOR PART FOUR TO SEE WHAT IS GOING TO HAPPEN. I HOPE YOU ( SYLVIA) MAKE IT WORTH IT.

B0031207RA|5.0|It is easy to install. I bought it for my Buell xb12ss Lightning Long from 2009.<br />My one has higher handlebars (LSL kit). Unfortunately the screws are to short.<br />So you can only use that for standard handlebars - otherwise screws too short.
B000FFJYCU|4.0|What does one say......I like the movie.....I have read all about the production and enjoyed seeing the cars that filmed the racing.....Awesome
B007HO392S|5.0|Great CD for the country fan, Carrie Underwood always has a great CD, received item promptly and received as described.
B00CA4S27W|4.0|Blackmore's Night new album \\"Dancer & The Moon\\", is one excellent album, they put it all together here, sure they still do their renaissance type music, but this is more upbeat on this one.  We get \\"Somewhere Over The Sea (The Moon Is Shining)\\", great vocals by Candice and very good guitar by Ritchie, nice bouncy number.  Love their version of the Uriah Heep classic \\"Lady In Black\\", nice flute and it gallops good.  \\"Last Leaf\\", is a nice stunning tune, \\"Troika\\", has a great lift, \\"I Think It's Going To Rain Today\\", is a song that many of today's artists might like, the mid-evil stomp of the title track, \\"Galliard\\", a nice instrumental, very good orchestration.  They cover the old Rainbow tune \\"The Temple Of The King\\", a nice selection for Candice's voice and a nice tribute to ex-Purple mate the late Jon Lord on \\"Carry On...Jon\\".  This is their best album since \\"Secret Voyage\\".  The DVD contains 4 acoustic numbers \\"The Ashgrove\\", \\"The Spinner's Tale\\", \\"Queen For A Day\\", \\"Somewhere Over the Sea\\" and an interview section.  There is no backing of this album, so it's going to die a fast death, and that's too bad!!!
B00932A4XE|4.0|Funny comedy on pregnancy for all to enjoy.  Obviously, some uncharacteristic pregnancies and situations, but overall a decent movie to watch.

B00785P2QC|3.0|Like others I am not a fan of posting on Facebook and annoying all my friends every time I build something I n my game  they don't need to know or do they care.  The game is fun to be creative with but is very time consuming.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Love the time period and the clothes! Very interesting story line and time in history. Can't wait for the next season.
B00BEZTMFY|2.0|I'm having difficulty sitting through these recent Peter Jackson films.  Maybe I should just skip the rest, but virtually every one of them is tauted as one of the greatest films of all time, so my curiosity gets the best of me.  In terms of positives, \\"The Hobbit\\" has a good lead actor (Martin Freeman) and the opening 30 minutes are engaging, but much of the rest of the film drags.  There are a few decent (albeit short) fights during the middle (with a few longer fights near the end), but there are too many side plots and too much filler material to slug through.  The script is unfocused and unengaging.<br /><br />I think one of Peter Jackson's big problems is his failure to set-up intermediate goals for the protagonists.  Instead, he sets up a long-term goal and has the protagonists walk around for 6 hours while they fend off random attacks.  This creates a monotonous, dull framework that cripples the enjoyability of the film.<br /><br />Compare this to Clash of the Titans (1981), which laid out a series of fascinating obstacles that were accomplished throughout the course of one 2-hour film:<br /><br />-capturing and taming Pegasus<br />-seeking the blind Stygian witches and coercing information out of them<br />-venturing to the Gorgon island and defeating the canine guardian Dioskilos<br />-entering Medusa's lair, defeating her, and retrieving her head<br />-defeating Calibos and his giant scorpions<br />-facing the Kraken<br /><br />I think Clash of the Titans is a true epic adventure because the long-term goal requires a plethora of intermediate accomplishments. They're not just arbitrary dangers that the protagonists encounter along the way. Many of these goals are necessary steps that must be taken in order to achieve the final long-term goal. When all is said and done, I can look back and admire the difficulty and complexity of the journey. Each individual success becomes a memorable event.<br /><br />Such is not the case with The Hobbit, which basically has the protagonists walk around and fight villains without any interesting identifiable purpose other than reaching the dragon's lair - an event that will likely occur in the 6th hour of the trilogy (if we're lucky!). It just feels like a series of meaningless clashes that become conflicts because the protagonists were not lucky enough to avoid them along the way to reaching their long-term goal. The obstacles feel arbitrary and there's no anticipation or build-up to any of them. There's no sense of accomplishment to the protagonists' actions.<br /><br />The action choreography is not impressive enough to make up for any of the flaws.  The escape thru the lair of the Ballsack Chin King is pretty good, but a bit too tension-less.  Gollum shows up and is annoying as usual.  Gandalf uses the same three tricks that he used in LOTR.  Can Peter Jackson please give us a few cool magic spells for a change?  I don't think I've ever seen such a lazy attempt at wizardry in my entire life
0374139563|4.0|A very exhausting scholarly work by Dambisa Moya. She has made a strong case against non-emergency/relief aid which she claims is a big incentive for conflict, corruption and poor governance. She has offered an array of free market economic tools like trade, FDI, capital market, remittances, micro-finances, etc that have a proven track record and a great potential to rescue Africa.<br /><br />--The best time to plant a tree is twenty years ago.

B000003CUJ|5.0|I am a pretender in Wagner and abjectly so. I am not alone. We are legion. Here on Amazon, I could nominate a dozen or so reviewers who really know their stuff. As someone once said to me: unless you long in your bones for the first act of Siegfried - a bridge too far if you ask me - you cannot count yourself a Wagnerian. Keep your distance from the Green Hill and those spartan seats!<br /><br />I live in terror of the day when the angry (and super-heated) ghost of Winifred Wagner materialises in my living-room and demands to audit my collection. Discs such as the Ring without Words broadcast my status as a pretender. It's as bad as Liszt for Lovers or Mozart & Marshmellows. Nevertheless I will risk Winifred's ire. I won't part with my decades-old copy of Ring without Words. Love is mine.<br /><br />Contrary to all expectations, Uncle Lorin takes us on a journey and successfully so. One soon gets swept up in the torrent. The transitions are not ineptly handled. More pertinently, where else are you going to hear some swaggering virtuosity married to poetic insight? Wotan's Farewell almost melts through the floor - how did the Berlin Phil do it? How did they ever do it? Much the same could be said of Dawn, Hagen's Call to his Vassals  and the Funeral March itself: the sheer intensity of the music-making nullifies whatever reservations one might have.<br /><br />The Teldec recording is in the demonstration class. One could argue that it is the label's greatest single disc.<br /><br />It is also an important historical document. It was recorded in December 1987 towards the end of Karajan's reign. The Berlin Phil is still at its resplendent best. For those who glut themselves on its saturated fat, this is the most sybaritic of feasts. No matter how resoundingly the brass and timpani thunder forth , the strings are always `there'. Moreover, it is not Karajan at the helm: the Klang must have been intrinsic to their DNA at the time. A year after Herbie's death, the Berlin Philharmonic recorded Mozart's Mass in C Minor with Abbado. More and more, I am coming to view the latter as a seminal recording. It documents the degradation of the Berlin Phil from a cosmic phenomenon to just another first rate orchestra - their current status today.<br /><br />Defy Winifred and her brood! Lap up the decadence! Revel in the bleeding chunks!<br /><br />What a disc!hilharmonic recorded Mozart's Mass in C Minor with Abbado.

B003XKPPOU|1.0|This is the 2nd time I've ordered this movie from Amazon/Mila Technologies and once again it came without the Digital Copy insert that contains the transfer code, so I can't use the Digital Copy.  It's really too bad, since I've been trying to get this for my son and wanted to use the digital copy for our iPad when traveling.

B00AFROVQC|2.0|I appreciate the hard work and time that goes into writing a book, so I applaud Morgan for the work put into this.  However, the plot and writing is very Amatuer.  The interaction with the royal family and other characters is unrealistic at best, everything goes predictably perfect for the hero....etc...

B004PGO25O|5.0|Pressfield weirdly describes my life story by telling his own tale of his early failures.  But his explanations for why things happen are radically different than mine.  And now side-by-side his makes more sense.  Do the Work has revealed to me the true enemy.  Since I picked up this book this morning, my odds of winning have increased ten-fold or more.
B00BEXB18M|5.0|I love the new Megadeth.Songs like Kingmaker, Don't Turn Your Back & Cold Sweat are pure ear candy.As usual; great riffs and solos.I think Shawn Drover's drumming is his best work thus far.I noticed some people complaining about Dave's singing, frankly, when I think of Megadeth, singing is the last thing that comes to mind.Anyways, bravo Dave, another great album to add to your already venerable catalogue.
B009NY43NY|5.0|I have been a fan of the books from the start, and though I won't claim to have seen the end play out as it did, it was certainly the best way to end this delightful series that has been my companion for so many years.

B00CW665VI|4.0|I enjoyed this book. This is a romance from the guys point of view. The last few chapters were a little predictable but still enjoyed it.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I enjoy the subtle strategy of this game ,not sure exactly what it is but my guess is the strategy of dropping coins in a certain pattern to get the result you want is as hit and miss as most things in life except there is no real consequence other than having to wait for your coins to regenerate. It feels very whimsical:)
B00B2V66VS|3.0|This app is very fun and it is a new favorite of mine. I love it and it is great, but the bad thing about it is that it will not keep the coins you gather. I went from 33,000 coins to 27,000 in one day without spenting a single coin. Then from there I exited the game for five minutes and when I came back I had less than 3,000 coins. This is a major problem for me because I can't save up anymore.  I would appreciate it if Imangi Studios would fix this soon. Other than that this game is right on!!!!

B00CL68QVQ|3.0|Review - Silver Linings Playbook<br /><br />What kind  of romance is to be expected between two freaks?<br /><br />David O Russell's 2012  movie \\"Silver Linings Playbook\\" - a romantic comedy-drama film starring  Jennifer Lawrence, Bradley Cooper, Robert De Niro and  Jacki Weaver - is  a rather simple but fresh addition to Hollywood's endless list of  romantic movies.<br /><br /> After beating up the lover of his wife Nikki, Pat Jr.  (Bradley Cooper) is institutionalised and diagnosed with bipolar  disorder. He loses his wife, house and job and has to move back in with  his mother Dolores (Jacki Weaver) and his  father Pat Sr. (Robert De  Niro) in Philadelphia. Determined to get his previous life back - with a  first step of trying to contact his wife - he finds help in Tiffany  (Jennifer Lawrence), who is also reeling from a personal loss. Pat and Tiffany build a complicated friendship comprehending love and hate, which is based on the selfish try to receive help from the other to  achieve their individual goals. The process in doing so might still  affect the targeted goal.<br /><br />Despite the  intention to create a movie which unites romance, as well as comedy and  drama, \\"Silver Linings Playbook\\" does not successfully achieve a  homogenous mixture where all genres involved reach their climax. Instead  the whole plot is lacking in suspense. Nevertheless the acting of  Bradley Cooper and Jennifer Lawrence is outstanding. They manage to  embody the role of two mentally disordered young people, who try to cope  with life their way, incomparably well. All in all not a must have in  your DVD shelves but still worth watching.
B002BBJ52U|1.0|The main girl is too whiny and I personally cannot stand her.  I had to turn it off.  I liked her in Walk The Line...even though she sort of whined in that movie as well.  I don't....it was stupid.  Was not impressed and personally, I'd prefer my money back.

B0081SRJSY|4.0|I enjoy the game immensely. The only thing that would bump it up for me would be if I could play friends online with the app. This is limited to AI players, although it can be used as a substitute for the board game itself, as you could pass the phone/tablet around and play.
B00CKZX0AA|4.0|One thing is certain...This is quintessential Hans Zimmer scoring.  Simple and minimalist themes, driving rhythms, heavy use of repetition, big powerful notes, and a blend of Strings, Brass, Percussion, and electronic pads.  If you're looking for an intricate melody, you won't find it here.  What Hans Zimmer offers is \\"Texture\\". It's impossible not to compare it to the Dark Knight soundtracks, so if you enjoyed listening to these, I would say it is on par if not better than the Dark Knight's score.<br /><br />But as is often the case, for me anyways, you won't realize you like it right away.  That's the caveat of using minimalistic melodies, they're not immediately recognizable or memorable (even with the heavy repetition).  But they GROW on you.  After my third listening I was anticipating and really getting into the big moments and the various motifs, of which there are more than at first I realized.  I must withhold the 5th star however, because there were still too many moments in the soundtrack that I refer to as \\"filler\\".  I'm sure it helped the film along, but I rarely care to listen to a minute long minimalist etheral pad sequence.  And finally, while I do enjoy the Hans Zimmer style, I still miss the days where you could just hum a melody and it would be instantly recognizable.  \\"Melodic branding\\", if you will, is lacking from many of modern movies' scores (LOTR being the most note-worthy exception)<br /><br />My recommendations to anyone considering this album:<br /><br />The Amazon samples aren't very representative of what you get, movie scores vary wildly, even within the same track, so it's hard to give an accurate snapshot of the album using brief sound bytes.<br />I'm assuming you like movie scores.  If you don't normally listen to them, this is probably not the album for you.<br />If you do listen to them, then you should ask \\"am I looking for a rousing and lasting melody?\\"  If so, then go buy John William's original soundtrack and forgo the negative feedback on this one over stylistic preferences.<br />If however, you enjoyed the Dark Knight or Inception soundtracks, then don't pass on this one.  After a few listens through you may find it is superior to them.
B009EQG80W|4.0|Although written 40+ years ago, this timeless piece of wisdom is still relevant in today's world of disintegrating values and quick-fix solutions. Very enlightening.
B009IJJB8G|5.0|Honestly, I can't say enough about the sheer, sterling quality of this series!  I remember when I first saw an initial preview of it - I said &#34;no way, it'll never work, and that cast - impossible!&#34;.  A female Watson?  Seriously???  But I've been wrong before and I never trust first impressions.  Give this series a close watch - you'll be hooked!  I will refrain from any episode details here so as not to spoil anyone's enjoyment -  but I simply have to go on record about the quality of this series.<br /><br />With each episode, we see some of the most brilliant writing, complex and ever-evolving plots, totally unexpected twists and turns - and the cast is absolutely top-notch!  The character development over the first half of the season brings us slowly into this &#34;recovering addicts&#34; world and Joan Watson's role expands ever-deeper into a full-blown and talented investigator in her own right.  We glimpse the kind of intense, eccentric personality that makes Sherlock the brilliant consultant that he is, all the while we also see his faults, his inability to cope in some social situations, his lack of patience for those of us that &#34;don't catch on fast enough&#34; -  and the kind of essential support that Joan Watson gives him as his &#34;sober companion&#34; -  this is a very different and unique glimpse of the pair that we've seen in the RDJ &#34;Holmes&#34; adaptation or the equally-brilliant portrayal that Benedict Cumberbatch gives us in BBC's &#34;Sherlock&#34;.<br /><br />The main cast including Gregson, Sabastian Moran, Moriarty.. and Irene Adler.... keeps us long-time Holmes fans well-rooted in the world we've come to know and love from other adaptations.... yet there are unique elements that make this series fresh and exciting!  In &#34;Elementary&#34;, we see a different slice of time and of character, and yet the writing is so brilliant that there is no disturbance in one's perspective while we watch in awe as case after gruesome case issolved in jaw-dropping suspense and incredibly talented acting.  The worlds appear to be &#34;seamless&#34; and do not conflict!  Bravo, to this new pair of Holmes and Watson, and to the writers who have created something truly unique here!  Kudos to this incredibly talented acting team of Lucy Liu and Jonny Lee Miller.  May there be many, many more seasons to come!<br />-  John D.,  Maryland
B001NHZ2KM|4.0|This is a fine DVD. A lot of good fun scenes. I don't approve of the violence / breaking of the guitar and aggression but they had a lot of good music and Daltry is a great singer.

B001B2CPH2|5.0|I love this movie! Although I have seen it numerous times, I always enjoy seeing it again and again. A wonderful movie.
B007GE2H3G|3.0|While staying true to the story, it's definitely not for an older audience who used to be fans as kids.  The characters are shallow and action sequences far less realistic than even the comics/books depicted.
B00514HDNW|2.0|Honestly after reading this book I can say that the movie was better. Robert Neville happens to be some poor soul who survives the outbreak of vampires, and spends most of his time being an angry drunk. The ending was very anti-climatic so I give this a 2.

B0078X2LKY|4.0|Admit it, isn't it almost always our anticipation of what the end of a book is going to bring us that keeps us reading it? Well, that's exactly what makes this book so much fun to read to your kids, over and over, and over again.  I believe that this book has a very good chance of becoming a classic in the world of children's literature.
B0058VA2U4|1.0|As a thrash musician, I hate saying that I don't like other bands' music. I know how hard it is to write this music, especially in this day and age. So many great, new bands are doing it, though. Lich King, Vektor, Violator, Fueled By Fire. All amazing thrash metal. So you'd expect, in 2011, that one of the \\"Big 4\\" bands (they like to remind us that all the time) should write a ripping thrash album. Well, if you want that, you're going to be sorely disappointed. Get ready for the most poppy sound you have heard in a while.<br /><br />Worship: I am a big fan of ambient intros and such. This one, however, is completely pointless. It doesn't lead into what follows. It's just there. What were they going for, Bonded By Blood? They missed it by a country mile. The intro to BBB is short, this should have been the same.<br /><br />Earth on Hell: Starts with probably the fastest thing on the album, but isn't very clean. In the verse riff, there is a nice dissonant chord that starts it, and the riff is RUINED by putting pointless rests in the guitars and bass drum. Ladies and gentleman, get used to this, because pointless rests are EVERYWHERE. Even at this slow tempo, that riff packs energy, yet it is all taken away when instruments stop. By the way, Scott Ian, get over yourself and your group shouts. The chorus riff is a completely change of feel. It sounds patriotic when it starts, and then the vocals kick in over a fat, but a weak riff. It doesn't hit hard. And what's this, a breakdown? I mean, it's not As I Lay Dying (thankfully), but it has all of the makings of what we have come to know as a breakdown in metal. The solo seems rushed, but most of Rob's do. It seems like this was just thrown in there JUST to have a solo section. Another verse and chorus and we're done.<br /><br />The Devil You Know: Wow, this song is just...wow. What the hell, are they trying to be tough and failing terribly? That verse riff goes on wayyyyy too long. And it's a boring riff. It's like a \\"tough guy\\" riff... The crap you hear when hanging out with some bikers who think this is the hardest thing ever. The pre-chorus is nothing special. You know, there have only been like 5 riffs on this album so far. Just saying. Anyways, this chorus? It's pop. This is not thrash. Nothing so far has been thrash metal. This is a pop, Saliva-esque, chorus. Thrash metal isn't sing along, so we really need to stop calling this thrash. That first solo was another odd one, just thrown in there. Wait, another breakdown type section? What happened to when they would write mid tempos and such? This is showing what they are: pop choruses and breakdowns. This is radio rock, not thrash. Anyways, this solo feels like a solo. Still short, but showing Caggiano has some moves up his sleeve. Another verse and chorus, and it's done. Oh wait, no it's not. A fake ending I see. Some fake endings work, this doesn't. We've heard this before. Surprise me please. By the way, the shouting in the background? Proves this is trying to be radio-rock friendly music.<br /><br />Fight 'Em 'Til You Can't: Got the radio intro, that works in this one. Those intro hits hit like an Anthrax riff should. The riff afterwards is slow and unenergetic, and a lot of that is to blame on the drums. When you start on the snare, and are only hitting your hi hats on the snare, it typically sounds slower. Plus, behind a boring riff, it's going to drag. Even adding the double bass doesn't help it. Man, what a pop rock sounding verse. Nothing hits hard in it. Man, they go back to the slow riff, and more Scott Ian vocals? Just stop, Scott. OH MY GOD THIS CHORUS. WOW. Just sing along pop rock. Nothing thrash about it so far. Nothing, especially that chorus. So so so radio friendly. I guess that's what they're going for. At least they go back to those hits. Fun snare fills by Charlie. Man, this solo section. There's parts in the solo that actually work, but think if they had intense solo riffs for intense solos to be written. A few good melodic ideas, but isn't brought out by a crummy solo riff. Pre-chorus and chorus to end this one.<br /><br />I'm Alive: Clean guitar tone is crummy. Nothing ambient about it. Hey, isn't this a Manson song? Yeah, yeah! The Beautiful People, right? Oh, it's not? Oh, well maybe they shouldn't play that boring rhythm with RESTS for like 2 minutes. Wow...it's going into the verse. BOOOOORING. These guys want to fit in more with Disturbed and Shinedown, than Exodus and Demolition Hammer. Man, both the pre-chorus and chorus are just pop. That's all this album is: pop. Solo is fine. Just a little too much \\"put-your-wah-pedal down\\" tone. Kind of bright. Man, this chorus....just, I don't even know what to say. Another middle section with rests. Shocking. Not breakdowny this time, more poppy. The solo is the same as before: it works fine, but that tone is just...ugh. It's painful. I like when songs end like that sometimes, with a solo and vocals. But over such a poppy riff, and the guitar turned so down (though that helps it not cut through as much), it just doesn't work here.<br /><br />Hymn 1: This actually works. Sounds synth-y, but like I said, I like things like this, and it works. Best thing I have heard so far.<br /><br />In The End: Anybody who knows me personally knows that I love bells and whistles... literally. So I appreciate the bells at the beginning. Then starts just a boring riff, with some happy guitar lead over it. Nothing getting me excited like builds should. And what do you know: VERSE RIFF HAS RESTS, AND IS THE SAME THING AS BEFORE. Just no energy. Wasn't this the band that would run around on stage? Oh, that's right, that was the thrash band Anthrax, not the pop rock one. Sing along chorus again. No change in drums? They've been doing that for like a good two minutes. Just no effort to destroy the listener. It's like they want to appeal to radio rock fans. They're doing well in that department. The middle section riff is just a variation ofthe first one we heard. Nice falsetto, Joey. They should have brought that out more, but I see what they were going for. Does Scott Ian only write one riff for a song and just play that and a variation the whole time? This solo is more of a lead than a solo. Just harmonizes the guitars overall. Now they're singing the bell part, and back to a chorus? Very formulaic of the album so far. Wow, that whole song was like five minutes of two riffs.<br /><br />The Giant: It starts with snare drum and a boring bend riff. Not for me. And what do you know about the verse? RESTS. MORE RESTS. That's why this album lacks energy, they keep pulling the potential back down. And a sing a long chorus. Slow, poppy, and boring. The middle riff is a variation of the the first one, without the bend at least. The solo works for the riffs that it is given to be performed over. It seems like solos have gotten the most care on this album so far, even if some can be bland at times. Now we're adding harmonized vocals over the chorus. It's not helping it. This song is another three riff one.<br /><br />Hymn 2: Just some snare work by Charlie so far. Unlike the other one, this had no reason to be its own track.<br /><br />Judas Priest: I like the band Judas Priest, and this sounds nothing like them if that's what they're going for. They should have called this song Shinedown. The guitar lead works, but the riff is just so... happy. ANOTHER VERSE RIFF WITH RESTS AND MINI SING ALONG SECTIONS. Get a new idea, Ian. Chorus itself isn't so sing along, but slow and not intense. The part after it has the sing along factor though. What did they want people to do when listening to this album? Circle pit, or hold hands and sing? I haven't wanted to headbang once so far. This sounds like another \\"tough guy, I work out at the gym\\" one. Frankie is finally getting some shine for a moment in the middle section, but it still has rests. WHY? This riff had potential, when it went down especially. But I guess energy doesn't get you on the radio? At least the solo has been given care again, and it transitions smoothly back into the intro riff. Too bad it went back to it. Another chorus... ugh. SURPRISE ME, ANTHRAX. Crap, that's right, SURPRISES DON'T GET YOU ON THE RADIO.<br /><br />Crawl: Again, that clean tone just doesn't do it. It needs some chorus on it or something. Oh god, when those vocals kick in, it sounds like Puddle of Mudd. Man, Charlie, build those toms. WOW, THAT VERSE RIFF SERIOUSLY SOUNDS LIKE PUDDLE OF MUDD! Just nothing gripping me in as thrash. It's all radio rock. Chorus is nothing special at all. The mini solo after the chorus works, helps propel it back into the verse, at least. Wow, and am I really hearing strings in this intro riff? I thought this was a thrash album. String sections have their place on thrash albums, but... oh yeah, this isn't a thrash album. Another forgettable mid section. Write something that pulls me into the music. Another wah tone solo, but I like that chord he's outlining at the start of it. Again, the solo seems to have been given the most attention. Another chorus. Geez.... back to that middle section.<br /><br />The Constant: What the hell is this? A PG-era WWE wrestler's (sorry, sports entertainer) intro? Another \\"gym\\" riff. I almost expect to be called \\"bro\\" as I listen to this. That verse is nothing special, and the chorus isn't either. They have a semi-sequence in there (I use sequence loosely), but it is so happy. I want energy, aggression, and intensity from Anthrax. I'll give them this, the steel string acoustic near the end of the chorus was at least a new idea, it's just kind of buried. Man, that pre-chorus is so HAPPY. That is such a modern middle section. Riding the crashes, so \\"bro-y.\\" The solo in this one has some nice runs, and again seems like Rob was trying to do something to save this. What do you know, another chorus near the end. Seriously, a lot of these songs have like 3 riffs.<br /><br />Revolution Screams: They tried to do something aggressive in that intro, but it lacks something. Something isn't propelling it to where it should be. Having that repeating \\"blast\\" helps. That verse riff just doesn't hit. It actually works better when the drums do the straight mid tempo beat, but the tempo is just so slow, that it's not as punishing as it could be. That chorus is just so poppy. So 97.1 The Eagle (here in Dallas, at least). This song doesn't make me want to scream. Hey, that middle riff has some potential. They're just not doing much with it. The tom fills sound good. Man, the vocals ruin the music of that riff. That does not work as a riff for vocals. Geez, what is this lead they put over it? It makes it sound 100 times more happy. Wah solo again, this solo doesn't do too much for me. The ending of it was nice, had some good runs, but felt tagged on. Another chorus. I'm shocked at how similar all of these structures are. It's the same thing every song. When the mid tempo beat kicks in that last part, it works best. They should have prolonged that. Instead, they drag out a half note beat. The \\"blast\\" propels it again, and this is coming from a guy who hates blasts.<br /><br />New Noise: That intro was pointless. What is this trying to be, creepy? God, another tough guy sounding song. Hold on, I got to go work out really fast. What the hell is this song about? Dancing? What happened to Metal Thrashing Mad? TALKING VOCALS? REALLY? Help me... please, help me. I just don't even know what to say about this one. It's about... dancing... that's how you're going to end your album? Dancing? Hey, that mid tempo riff actually hits a little bit. And then the vocals ruin it. They try the thrash beat at the end, but it's not going to help it. It's done. Finally, it's done.<br /><br />Overall: Anthrax is a thrash band, right? They wanted to present this as a \\"return to form\\" and a \\"comeback,\\" since it had been so long since their last one. Let me tell you: If you're looking for a thrash metal album, look elsewhere. This is NOT, and never will be, thrash metal. This is radio-friendly, pop rock, and as a radio-friendly, pop rock album, it does its job. But if you want to review it as a thrash album, then it is the worst one I have ever heard. There is just nothing redeeming. I don't even like it as a pop rock album, but at least I could see it on the radio.<br /><br />They had 8 years to write an album, and this is what we got? It's unacceptable. Anthrax, next time around, give us a true return to form. Don't worry about what's popular on the radio, worry about what thrash metal fans want. Hold down your Shift key and hit the number 4 on your keyboard. See what that makes? Gives a whole new definition to the term \\"Big 4.\\"

1840226757|5.0|Our children love the old Disney movie and asked for the book. Finding the sequel in the same binding was a real treat. They are enjoying the story and love finding differences between the movie and original book. (Don't we all?)
B0044XV3R8|5.0|If you are an Avatar fan, this is a must-have.  It has lots of extra features for your viewing pleasure.  Turn the lights low, sit back, and enter the Avatar world of fantasy.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|This novel is crazy, yet heartwarming. It ends  in a beautiful way and becomes positive after years of negativity. Although I have not yet seen the movie, I am definitely buying the DVD and hoping it is as good as the book.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|I can count on this app at all times.  Accurate time, temperature, future/weekly forecast, and fair weather warnings.  The best.
159463176X|4.0|Intertwined stories of people closely connected to each other for over 60 years are beautifully narrated in their own time. Several characters are touched into the stories, but my most favorite of all are Pari and Abdullah; siblings who were set apart when Pari was barely 4 years old and Abdullah at 10 years old I think. They were reunited after more than 55 years of separation through a touching ending.<br /><br />Following the stories of the different lives from 1949 up until 2010, I caught myself in great awe of the events that unfolded especially at the ending where most of my anticipation lied.
B003VANOFY|4.0|Pros:<br />Wireless<br />Good Sound<br />Comfortable for extended use<br /><br />Cons:<br />Occasional disconnection problems<br />Virtual Surround Sound is sometimes &#34;echoy&#34; or distorted sounding<br />Finicky program/drivers<br /><br />Overall, I'm very satisfied with the headset. I like being able to use it in most rooms of the house, although the range isn't big enough for every area.<br />I initially used the charging base to plug in the wireless receiver but the headset would disconnect for 10-15 seconds about once an hour. After doing some searching, it was recommended to plug directly into the PC, which fixed the issue.<br />Using the on-disc program/drivers, the program began to freeze up and not allow me use the virtual surround sound. After finding the updates on their website, reliability is much improved. Occasionally i still run into the same issue though.<br />Virtual surround sound is hit or miss. Makes skype calls sound very echoy. Gaming usually sounds fine, although some games sound very strange and distorted. I usually leave it off as the stereo sound is better sounding for most applications.
B00705GEO4|4.0|The album is great: lyrics, music, art cover, all of it. The only thing that caught my atention was that the inside booklet was misprinted. I say this because the order of the song in the CD does not match the order of the songs in the booklet. To be more precise: \\"Gott mit uns\\" and \\"Ruina Imperii\\" are swtiched in the booklet. A minor mistake, but still lowers the quality of the item. I don't know if I'm the only \\"lucky one\\" affected or its a printing mistake, but it is what happened to me...<br /><br />PS: English is not my native language so I apologize for all the mistakes you might find above.

B006IGZWB2|5.0|I actually needed to watch this movie for one of my classes, but I'm actually glad I watched it. It was so good!
B008UCJ7KO|2.0|I enjoyed books 1 & 2, pre ordered book 3, reread books 1 & 2 just before the release of book 3! Thinking this was trilogy, I expected the story to wrap up with a happy ending. So disappointed when I was left hanging for the NEXT book(s). I enjoyed most of the story but wanted closure.
B00BQPEIT2|5.0|Amazing graphics. Very fun and totally addicting !! First game I bought on my kindle fire. Definitely better than the others.
B0015DRPJU|5.0|This book always makes me feel so much emotion. Rose goes through a lot in her life in just a short time period. I read this book in record time and I know I'm looking forward to the next one. I may already know what happens but as I reread these books I fall back in love with them.
B0084U0IEG|4.0|Ian Mcewan, no matter the story, is a master at penning the English language. I would rather read well-written prose than an exciting story by an author who doesn't have writing skills. However, this said, this is a good read.  Espionage is the explicit theme but the story is about so much more than espionage. The setting is the 1970s and the main plot revolves around a recent, rather naive, college graduate who has an uncanny ability to have affairs with unsuitable lovers. Further she stumbles her way into a job with a CIA counterpart of British origins where her immature, girlish romantic longings end up entrapping her in situations where she is treading on serious matters with serious consequences. Mcewan's character studies are perceptive, realistic and well -developed;. especially Serena, the narrator and main character. Although deceit is not particularly what Serena has in mind, the reader is taken along on her psychological journey as though we are her alter ego, to watch and wonder what choices we would have made if we were Serena.
B0009P5YXO|5.0|My daughter plays with it all the time. Always points it at me, hoping it will do something. Got to careful with it. Parts are a little cheap. But still fun.
B008GXHOFW|4.0|I like the amazing spider man because it's a lot of fun.<br />My favorite part of the game is the challenges.
B002WV5A9G|4.0|Good character set-ups, acting and directing strong.  It moves without feeling like an out-of-control roller coaster or factory explosion.  Interesting story, with some tricky loops thrown in that occasionally take a little extra mental gear-work to get.  A pleasurable reboot... The 2013 follow-up is even better.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|I'm not the only one who can't wait. Never read Follett before I picked up Book I now I will
B00BQPEIT2|5.0|THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION and rose singing turn my boyfriend doing the same thing as a girlfriend makeup of hip-hop and the little girls fighting games for boys in the bathtub Jake Gyllenhaal split into two parts when you are not making Rachel crow crying in Waterbury cr
B00CATSONE|4.0|An informative and enjoyable read that gives the reader much to think about. The genius of Tesla surely deserves more detail than the author give and the upbeat presentation of the significant trials and tribulations of his life seemed a bit at odds, but this is a great, quick read to learn just enough about this amazing man to know you want to learn more.
B007SGM084|5.0|These books have a great love story as well as sexual rendezvous. Christian Grey is the ultimate man! I want a playroom now! Lol!

B00A1EOBJQ|4.0|Got this for my mother, she really likes it! She doesn't miss Nashville, so this will be good while on hiatus.
B0058O84G0|5.0|Enjoyed the historical setting and the way events are made real for those who have never been in a war or political uprising!
B005LAIGPA|5.0|This product worked very well and was in great condition. It played perfectly and i really enjoyed watching this movie.
B00CKJTOHO|5.0|Excellent season...can't wait until Season 8 starts. I had absolutely no issues with any of these episodes via instant Video. I may have to start buying more shows by the season to save a little extra $ overall :)
B00005JL3A|5.0|I would definetly reccomend this movie to someone. The disk play great and the box was in perfect condition when it arrived. I love all of these movies!
B00BRR66SA|3.0|It is ok. I have not listened to it much. I do like Justin Timberlakes music though. Not quite Nsync!
B00D6BN9NK|3.0|huge stretch of the imagination to go along with story line.  lots of action, but not credible that Bruce and his son could fall through 3 floors and walk away with a few scratches.
B00DBSZJRM|1.0|I was mildly amused by the concept of a Grimm fairytale with automatic rifles...then insulted by the crap plot and worse script. I paid close to $5 to stream this and feel ripped off...I can only imagine how people felt leaving the theaters.

B00BWBHIUG|5.0|So cute my boys and I enjoy playing and seeing what new fish will appear and what new friends will pop up
B004ADH1RI|4.0|Kids loved it but were scared.  I think it's PG.  Oddly, our kids (5 & 8) were not scared of Pirates of the Caribbean butnthisnone gave them some nightmares.  They said they liked it but it was a little hard to get them to bed for a few days.
B001KVZ6HK|4.0|I was not impressed with the &#34;3D&#34; on this movie. I'm not sure what the issue is, but it just strained my eyes to watch.
B008JMKN4Y|4.0|Would recommend. Easy read. Love story of bad boy balling for good girl and changing to be with her. They start as friends
B0091REZMW|4.0|take your time and you can play a little each day at no cost. very enjoyable!  a little off normal interaction which is refreshing
1469259842|4.0|If you are unaware of the quotes from Marcus Aureluis please introduce yourself.  Way before his time...  The gentleman who reads this book though is VERY dry and somewhat montone.  I listen to books on tape in my car but, this one I would suggest headphones while laying around.
B004EPZ06Q|2.0|Although I had some fun watching Part II of the movie I haven't found the same elements of surprise and creativity I found in Part i.<br />Lots of repeated ideas have been borroed from part I. I hope Part 3 would be something new and got to do nothing with the first two parts.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|I have enjoyed both of Khaled Hosseini's previous novels and once again he has done an amazing job of weaving individual lives and imagery into wonderful story telling. Both a lovely and heartbreaking story that captures the reader from page one and holds them to the end.
1417644931|3.0|Everyone I know loves this book. Everyone. It's one of those books you're assumed to adore if you're into fantasy. I seem to have missed it as a child so I picked it up.<br /><br />I almost wish I hadn't.<br /><br />It's not that The Last Unicorn is awful. It's a decent enough story with an interesting enough plot. The writing is stunning, if a bit overly descriptive. Unfortunately, I felt as if I needed to be high to truly appreciate it. As I am not one to get high that was a bit of a disappointment.<br /><br />Beagle seems to enjoy a good metaphor...and a mediocre metaphor and an all out unfortunate metaphor. The first is fine, even the second can be dealt with in moderation. The last was what eventually started to turn me away from the story.<br /><br />This was compounded by the realisation somewhere around the mid-way point that for all the writing was stunning, it wasn't saying much of anything. It was like walking through rainbow mist. Yes, it's pretty, but you spend too much time wondering why it's coloured.<br /><br />I do think The Last Unicorn can be enjoyed for its prose alone. There are some wonderfully playful turns of phrase and more than enough vivid descriptions for anyone. I simply wouldn't expect much more than that. At least not without pulling out the lava lamp.
B007SGLZP8|3.0|It's not as good as his earlier books, but it still kept my interest to the end.  I just expected more from him.
B005S9EKCW|5.0|I saw the movie on opening Day...and cried my eyes off. I've actually never seen the play. I've only heard the soundtrack over a hundred times, due to it being one of my mother's favorite musicals.  Being able to purchase a blu-ray version along with a dvd and digital copy was extremely convenient. I haven't completely switched all my dvd players to blu-ray. I love having a digital copy that i can put on my tablets. Now i can re-watch it anytime, anywhere. You definitely won't be disappointed if you purchase this.
B0071T5PN0|5.0|wow... back to the real Van Halen... what a great surprise!<br />after the fiasco of VHIII, you guys really nailed it<br />100% recommended
B004IE0NY2|5.0|The best thing I can say about this film is that it isn't the recent remake which lacked all of the important characteristics that are in this film. This film very accurately balances violence, adventure, sarcasm, and humor with a little cartoon-ish interaction and the comic book feel we all know and love in the movies these days. Great movie.
B004UPANAI|1.0|I probably am prejudiced by the fact that the movie kept FREEZING on my HD screen., however, being a Hugh Jackson fan and a HUGE FAN of Marvel productions I had to see the origin of Wolverine.  There was a lot more violence then story line and although I always want to care about the character I struggled to want to care about Wolverine.  Very disappointed.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|Always keeps me glued to the screen and wanting the next episode.  Simply fantastic!  It makes me want Season 3 even more!!!!
B005LAIHXQ|3.0|Decent film, very cool that it feels like watching the original Alien movies. Visually interesting to watch, but I wanted more back story. The film has good build in tension and action, but the plot is underdeveloped. We're watching for the Engineers... and there just wasn't enough about them to satisfy me. I get that it's as much a mystery as it is a thriller, but give me something to bite into!
B00C2U6G7C|5.0|Hans Zimmer is the most talked-about composer of today, and has made a massive name for himself. In 2013, Hans had three big movie scores released: Ron Howard's Rush, The Lone Ranger, and this. Out of the three, I'd say Lone Ranger is the most powerful, but that's a different review. With Man of Steel, Zimmer decided not to bring back the original Superman theme, and this divided listeners. Me personally, i think that's a good thing because this is a completely new Superman who has to prove he is super. Now, when it comes to the movie, i can understand some arguments of people either defending it or bashing it (for specific reasons), but to say it's a completely awful movie is false.<br /><br />The score helps to shape the film's atmosphere and fully immerse the audience with this epic world. Now, for some stupid reason, the tracks are out of chronological order (i'll provide the correct sequence at the end of my review), but this doesn't lessen the listening experience. The opening track &#34;Look to the Stars&#34; sets the scene in Krypton, where Jor-El is discussing with the council the future of Krypton. It's beautifully grand, and has heavenly vocals thrown in. It's quickly followed up by the track &#34;Oil Rig,&#34; which takes place during a rescue sequence where Clark helps to get people off of a burning oil rig. &#34;Sent Here for a Reason&#34; is when Clark, as a young kid, is told by his adoptive father that he's from another world. It's a pivotal moment in Clark's life, and the music helps to prove this. &#34;DNA&#34; is a big moment in the film where Jor-El obtains the Codex, and attempts to escape from General Zod's army as he attempts a coup d'tat. But, i'll stop there with the track details and simply say, my favorite track on the score (not the Deluxe edition) is a tie between &#34;If You Love These People&#34; and &#34;Goodbye My Son.&#34; Both are, in my opinion, the most emotionally-charged tracks on the score. Both represent turning points in the film (one more-so, and more controversial), but both are none-the-less captivating.<br /><br />Man of Steel is a massive step for Warner Bros. and the DC universe. I think if die-hard fans stopped to look and fully see the big picture of the movie, they could come to love it, and in doing so, the score. I'm not saying you can't like one without the other, but in the context of the film, the score is even greater.<br /><br />Track list in chronological order (combined with Deluxe Edition):<br /><br />1. Look to the Stars<br />2. This is Madness!<br />3. DNA<br />4. Goodbye My Sn<br />5. Ignition<br />6. Launch<br />7. I Will Find Him<br />8. Krypton's Last<br />9. Oil Rig<br />10. Are You Listening, Clark?<br />11. Sent Here for a Reason<br />12. I Have So Many Questions<br />13. Flight<br />14. Tornado<br />15. General Zod<br />16 & 18. Arcade<br />17. You Led Us Here<br />19. You Die or I Do<br />20. If You Love These People<br />21. This is Clark Kent<br />22. What Are You Going to Do When You Are Not Saving the World?

B004HW7JH4|5.0|I'm no TV critic and everyone has their own favorites.  For me, its more of altered reality of the past like Mad Men and less of today's reality which is not anyone's actual reality at all (if you get my drift).  Anyway, IMHO this is the best non-network (i.e. the big 4) tv series.  But as far as my purchase of this DVD goes, it provides so much more detail and behind the scenes work that makes this a huge success.  The packaging itself says they care a ton about the production value of the show and want it to have a legacy after the series finale.  I don't want to spoil the surprise, but each DVD set which I know own all of, comes uniquely packaged to reflect the episodes they contain.  I have purchased a few other Sets but this is by far the best.  The 5 Stars go for all the effort put into the DVD's and of course, the show itself rocks!

B00CKJ2KK2|5.0|I have been searching for a great game and had no success! Until I found Blitz Brigade! I have spent hours upon hours on this wonderful game. There are  Five classes. The solider the all around kind of guy. The gunner the most health and big guns. The medic has the ability to heal allies while damaging enemies. The sniper does lots of damage afar but little damage up close. Then the stealth he can turn invisible and uses up close weapons. I suggest you give this amazing game a try!

B00D6BU8GG|3.0|While the other Die Hard series was geared toward adults as well as children.  This one is not.  The stunts are extreamly unbelievabe that is so fake you get disapointed in the entire movie.  Although the story line is good, the makers of this movie tried too hard to put explosions and car chases that it runies the movie.  If you are a 12 to 15 year old boy you will like this movie.  For the rest of us you spend more time shaking your head on how fake that last shot was then you do figuring out the story line.
B00BTHWFBK|2.0|After listening to this disc I've come to the conclusion that what's missing is Bill Ward's drumming.  Bill had a jazz/swing style that fit Sabbath perfectly.  This disc could have been made by any metal band. I was being generous giving this album 2 stars.  And as for the production..really??  Loud doesn't necessarily make for a good disc.  I really wanted to like this but it's just not happening for me.

055358202X|3.0|I obviously enjoyed the first three books enough to go for the fourth, by I am starting to lose interest.  More characters are introduced, and there just isn't any closure.  I'm wearing down after nearly 4,000 pages.  Just too much.
B001PJRAUS|5.0|As a huge fan of Jane Austen I am often dubious about reworking her titles. After all, why mess with perfection.<br /><br />Lost in Austen is one of the examples where it is perfectly done.<br /><br />The acting is fantastic, the twists keep it fresh, yet it is still recognizable as Pride and Prejudice at its heart.
B002JI94J4|1.0|Folks-If you buy this blu-ray thinking you are getting an upgrade in picture and sound from your previously purchased standard DVD you are going to be greatly disappointed. Total waste of money and I feel burned having spent my hard earned pay on what passes as a blu-ray. Hold off buying this until it gets the blu-ray treatment it deserves.

Just hope it's not too long before we get to see how the story progresses!

0393338827|5.0|I recommend this book.  Michael Lewis described the origin of one of the largest financial crisis of the last 100+ years in a highly readable manner.  The book demonstrated reasons why individuals with very little income and savings bought houses they simply could not afford, why mortgage brokers indulged them in this madness, why investment banks packaged the subprime mortgages into Collateralized Debt Obligations (CDOs) and sold them to insurance companies and other institutional investors under not so watchful eyes of rating agencies, who highly rated these financial instruments.  The story is told through the eyes of founders and employees of three hedge funds that managed to see the absurdity of the situation and were not afraid to go against the flow and \\"short\\" the CDOs on a massive scale.<br /><br />Michael Lewis' descriptions of characters are vivid and funny, as always.  Readers will probably remember for a long time an image of a very candid bond salesman who was telling his clients that he would \\"rip their eyeballs out\\" as he would be buying insurance against CDOs from them.  The readers would probably also remember an image of a dictatorial chief of a large insurance company's division who did not listen to, and in fact intimidated, his employees who were warning him against buying CDOs.  Another precious image was that of a bullying trader who ran a proprietary desk at one of the major investment banks and who started out buying insurance on CDOs but ended up selling more than $16 billion worth of it.  When the CDO prices collapsed, his company had to cover this \\"insignificant\\" amount.<br /><br />People interested in the origin of the greatest financial crisis of our time would definitely benefit from reading this book.

B004DI7HZ6|5.0|I have just finished reading the book A Discovery of Witches and can't wait to start the second book in the series. I found this book very exciting and interesting.  I liked the history and how it is woven into the story.  There was just the right amount of explanation for all the witchcraft without being too wordy.  The vampires were also very interesting characters too,  with all the things they had done in their long lives.  I thoroughly enjoyed this book.  Please keeping working on the third book,  so I won't have long to wait.
B008I34YYY|4.0|I think if you watch this movie with  B movie expectations , you'll have a laugh. The dark side of the Moon nazi approach is funny at times. So you go from giggles to gut laugh's. The special effects are quite decent and for  B movie what more can you want ?  Rent if you have issues :)
B00D6BN9NK|2.0|HAD COMPLICATIONS TO VIEW, AFTER FINALLY GETTING ACCESS TO VIEW, I WISH I HADN'T! WORST OF ALL THE DIE HARD MOVIES I HAVE EXPERIENCED.
0061537969|5.0|Every once in a while I come across (in this case belatedly, as the book was published in 2009) a novel that emotionally picks me up, turns me upside down, and shakes me until my pockets are empty.  The early Greeks called this Catharsis--where one's nervous system is reset by laughter, tears, and other harder to name emotions .<br />The Art of Racing in the Rain by Garth Stein  tells a story through the eyes of a particularly wise dog.  That viewpoint could have been gimmicky or too cute, but it isn't.  Dog lovers will connect with the book, but so will those unfazed by canines, because here the dog's eye view is insightful and perceptive.  The story slips in tidbits about auto racing and life in Seattle, as well as sage advice for living through adversity.  All this is done in a fast-paced easy to read novel that is suitable for any age.
B005LAIISA|5.0|I really love the whole series of Ice Age...At first it was just the squirell but now it is everyone.  I hope they continue...
B0063M22QO|5.0|Great version for beginners as well as those with many games under their belt. Starts slow and builds as you gain confidence.
B00B769XB8|2.0|The only good thing about this movie is the 3d and the action, the 3d is awesome. Otherwise, this film is so dumb we should all feel insulted. I had hope during the first five minutes, but hope was lost after that...
0307938905|5.0|Excellent story and writing! Devoured it! Magical and inventive. Definitely would put on my top 5 books this year! Great read!
B00AB0Z88S|5.0|Usually I won't like a film if I've read the book beforehand, but this is truly an amazing film. On top of that, I've watched many, many 3d movies out there and this is THE best 3d in my opinion... beautiful, and far superior to Avatar.
B00B8M4IMK|5.0|No need for a outlet splitter with this thing. No more fighting over the charging port to charge close to zero smart phones etc. Simple and works.
B009MO5G90|3.0|We all know these films are not good, but the 3d is great in this one, which is why I'll give it 3 stars for the weapons that fly at your face, lol.
B0006IUDXA|5.0|My kids used to watch this on TV & now the Grand kids love it too.  It is fun to watch.
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|Loved the first two books and couldn't wait to read this.  I'm so very disappointed. Should have saved my money.  I could have written a better ending.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Wish the books came out faster though. People lose interest after waiting a year for the next one to arrive.
B00AK57N00|4.0|Great fun to test your reaction skills as well as your skills to anticipate and adjust to &#34;wind&#34; and &#34;gravity&#34;.<br />This is a game that requires very little learning curve,,,,you catch on to the concept immediately. It is a wonderful and fun time-killer that can be picked up or put down without some long elaborate startup or shutdown process.
B00992CF6W|4.0|I like the game but it crashes when i open the inventory and when i try to write a sign. I was excited about the new update but when i found that it crashes often i was mad. Mojang needs to fix this. FIX THE CRASH!
B001P5Q6FC|5.0|This is a awesome album. This album is so raw and the solos are awesome. Lamb of god are keeping real metal alive. Thank you Lamb of god for another awesome album.
B005OCHOZS|3.0|This was an enjoyable book and an easy introduction to the ultramarathon sport and vegan eating. I am not even a vegetarian but I appreciated Scott's style of communication on the topic. He strikes me as a very genuine, likeable guy. He's a runner who wrote a book, not a writer by trade so some expect great prose.
B0002S94OS|5.0|This is a great album. From top to bottom the entire album is amazing. One of the best metal albums to come out in the last decade.
B00CUWWLWG|4.0|my 4 year old likes to do the battles. it is fun for the family. great game to get addicted too.
B000092Q4U|5.0|As the Palaces burn is a great album. If you have not bought  a Lamb of god album before start with this one and then check out the other albums. Really raw!
B005C8ENI0|4.0|We definitely enjoyed watching this movie. The story line was unique and kept us engages throughout. Actors/actresses in the movie were superb.<br />The only thing I would critique was that there were three points at the end where we thought the movie was ending and it kept going.
B004FQX5CK|5.0|Just finished watching Final Cut. What I can say, well I will say. Unbelievable. This movie was brilliantly done and amazing in HD. Buy it. But I have a few philosophical thoughts so stop reading here if you are not interested or perhaps watch the movie first.  I first watched this as a kid and thought it was great in a Sci-Fi kinda way. My brother and I use to run about quoting. &#34;Its too bad she won't live. But then again who does?&#34; I think we understood it then. But not within the context that under pins the entire movie.  Today, I found deep subtleties that were quite haunting. What is life and is anything retained after we're gone? Or are our memories and experiences just like &#34;...tear drops in rain&#34;.  The death of Zhora was quite emotional and I now understand why it was suppose to be.  I'm not sure if it was done deliberately or my current state of mind (I'll admit to that), but you come to understand the true philosophical context of this work, which perhaps comes out more so in &#34;The Final Cut&#34; version.  Finally the question of Deckard and the answer (or no answer) reveals itself to be - irrelevent. This movie projects out the &#34;Ultimate Question&#34; onto the &#34;Skin Jobs&#34; as a pseudo representation of ourselves. The quest of &#34;...More life&#34; and the &#34;...itch you can never scratch&#34; as the knowing of what its like to &#34;...live in fear&#34; of it ultimately coming to an end sooner than you would like.  &#34;Thats what it is to be a slave&#34;  Regardless of culture, religion or ethnicity - it doesn't matter. Live life, cherish life and cherish the life of all people (and pigeons). As there are no guarantees only delusions. As the deluded conclude that they are better, smarter, superior and more worthly of life - effecting the deemed less worthly into a desperate fight or flight for survival. The aware will admit to know nothing and given the choice - will save life.  Watch this movie and you will see what I mean.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Thought this was only an explicit sex story or manual! I wasn't prepared for the story that this book presented!<br />Part Love story, Part Detective story, Part Heart Warming family  history, Mr. Grey is every women's dream.<br />Really worth the read and read it again to get ALL the details you missed during your first read!
B0050DIWFC|3.0|Seemed disjointed.  I expected lots of suspense but it just sort of rambled on.  I was not \\"captured\\" by this story.
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|This book is almost guranteed to enhance your life in some way or another. Give it a try. Its cheap enough or go to the library for free.
B0072GPQNG|4.0|I gave this show 4 stars.  I found the movie to be lacking something.  I don't feel it covered the emotional aspects well enough.  The movie was good, but the theatre was great!  I'd recommend this movie to anyone, otherwise.
0316228532|3.0|The Casual Vacancy<br />by J.K. Rowling<br /><br />With nearly 4,000 reviews on Amazon, and 15,000 reviews on Goodreads, I won't bore you with a summary of what the book is about.<br /><br />I bought The Casual Vacancy for my wife when it came out. My daughter LOVES the Harry Potter series and is on her 3rd journey through that series of books right now and I was very interested in what her first \\"adult\\" book would be like.<br /><br />That's probably the first, and most important, thing: this book is for adults. I'm not prudish about life, and I'm completely open to literature of all sorts...from Dickens to Bret Easton Ellis to any Oprah Book Club selection, I will read it.<br /><br />But there is periodic content in this book that would rob a child of innocence that they should be allowed to keep until they become adults. My advice...don't let anyone under 18 near it. But that decision is yours as a parent...it's only my opinion, and you know what they say about opinions and such.<br /><br />The book was okay. The topics didn't appeal to me, but the writing was decent, good in parts, but nothing really reached out and grabbed me about it. The main topics were sex, drugs, and a variety of struggling relationships. Some characters were VERY unbelievable to me.<br /><br />I started reading the book earlier than I thought I would because my wife didn't finish it. She's less tolerant of the edgy topics.<br /><br />I think 3 stars is fair. I don't believe in insulting authors and/or their writing...it's like insulting a mother or father for their parenting style...I think it indicates poor character to do attack and insult an author or their writing.  Authors spend months and years creating their babies, their books, and they deserve credit for their effort. I think all we, as readers, can legitimately do is say that a book wasn't for us.<br /><br />And so: this book was okay, but it wasn't for me. Maybe it's for you.<br /><br />Cheers!
B005LLSZNM|5.0|Among the best shows on television. I prefer to watch after I can get the entire season for uninterrupted watching.
B0030B621W|4.0|It kept my interest.  I orginally rented it from a video store but the movie kept freezing up.  It's not a movie for everyone but I liked it.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|This was an awesome gAme. I wish that it was longer. I can't wait for the next one. Hurry please.
B00CL68QVQ|5.0|I really enjoyed it.  My significant other was out of town and I knew he didn't want to see it so I took the opportuntity to watch it. Obviously I'm not disappointed.  Bradley did a good job acting and of course Jennifer did too.
B00C7O8TSM|5.0|I'll admit it: I can't possibly be critical of the Beach Boys. Not when I grew up in California at a time when they were our great white hope for the future of rock 'n' roll and I liked them a lot better than those other guys, you know, the mop-topped ones from Liverpool. I grew out of that one fast, but among the \\"closet\\" Beach Boys fans of the 1960's was a man named Paul McCartney, who parodied \\"California Girls\\" in \\"Back in the U.S.S.R.\\" and acknowledged that much of the motivation behind the Beatles' \\"Revolver\\" and \\"Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band\\" was his ambition to make a better album than the Beach Boys' \\"Pet Sounds.\\" This tour reunited all the survivors among the Beach Boys' core members, and I give them credit for a song list that includes not only the legendary surf, cars 'n' girls hits from the early 1960's but some of the obscurities from the 1965-73 period in which the Beach Boys made some of their best music despite Brian Wilson's ongoing mental meltdown: \\"The Little Girl I Once Knew,\\" \\"Heroes and Villains,\\" \\"Do It Again,\\" Bruce Johnston's haunting \\"Disney Girls,\\" \\"Add Some Music to Your Day,\\" \\"Forever\\" (used as a tasteful tribute to the late Dennis Wilson), \\"Marcella,\\" \\"All This Is That\\" and the third part of the \\"California Saga\\" from the \\"Holland\\" album. (They also did the hit from \\"Holland,\\" \\"Sail On, Sailor,\\" and if they'd done the other masterpiece from that album, Dennis Wilson's \\"Steamboat,\\" this would have been an even greater album than it is.) Despite everything they've been through, the Beach Boys' voices have held up surprisingly well and their legendary vocal harmonies are as ethereally beautiful as ever. I've seen them twice -- in 1971 in San Francisco when they were touring behind their last album-length masterpiece, \\"Surf's Up,\\" and in 1981 in San Diego where Dean Torrance came in as guest artist to sing the high part of \\"Barbara Ann\\" (as he had on the original record) and Brian Wilson made one of his first halting returns to the stage for the encores. This is a welcome souvenir of an act that, despite the ongoing conflicts between Brian Wilson and Mike Love that broke them up again after this tour, is still memorable and treasurable.
B00BI73CVI|1.0|I watch musicals from time to time and this one was horrible.  I watched half of it.  I couldn't take the pain anymore.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|It's a great game. Unfortunately my math stinks so some levels are a bit harder. I'm not the greatest detective either. A hint button would be very helpful!
B00B769XB8|5.0|I really liked this movie, it's an interesting spin on the whole Hansel and Gretel story! Love the cast, good choices and they played their parts well and with gusto. I for one liked this twist although it may not be for everyone so I think the story is well written and well told. Great action and special effects, this is a great popcorn movie although not for the whole family. This one is adults only, check it out!
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|It's easy to use<br />The game is funny<br />Everybody in . My family has this game<br />It's not that hard to get coins
B009MF5BXK|5.0|I was a huge fan of the first movie and in my opinion this one is even better. The cameos alone make this a movie worth buying and watching but the clencher is JCVD as the villain! He proves he can play the bad guy and well, the final battle between his character and Stallone's is epic! If you love action movies this one is definitely one to see and add to your library. Check it out!
B008IJTFYW|5.0|I love this app. I use it as background noise to help my baby fall asleep. So glad I found this!
B009AMAGXK|4.0|Based on the trailers I had seen I thought this movie might be worth a look and I was not disappointed. If you are fans of the Twilight series in particular and I'm not ashamed to say I am, you will undoubtedly enjoy this movie. I would think that Harry Potter fans will enjoy this too. Good cast choices and pretty engaging story not to mention awesome special effects! It's going to be interesting to see where the story goes next.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|You should get this game! It's a great game. There is so much to do! And you can get even more horses!
B00992CF6W|4.0|This game is great you should totally buy it.<br />The only thing I want is to be able to have wolves.<br />Other than that great game.
1780387105|5.0|everything i wanted and needed is in this book.Simple and easy to follow.works great with justins beginners guitar course.Great for new learners.I love it.
B00BNWWVFG|5.0|Good packaging - fast delivery -  Amazon is always good to shop with, always have eveything.  This movie was a great<br />who did what to who. Jude Law played his part great. Did not expect the ladies, if that is what you would call them..... They got<br />what they deserved. I never saw it coming. Just wish Channing Tatum would have played a larger part after he got out of jail.<br />It makes a person think about what kind of drugs the Doctors can give you to make you feel better??????  So they say !!<br />They need to make more moves like this - you really do not need all that action for a thrill.  When you have good actors and<br />a good script.
B008AK8FHM|3.0|The proposed science of it is very interesting. The spiritual details are somewhat confusing as far as the actual experience goes. I expected more given the popularity of the book.
B009PMEEY2|5.0|This was fun to play, but I finished it far too quickly and then there was nothing else to do.  Sob.
B00797MB0O|2.0|This movie was nothing like its trailers big surprise there right. If you like downward spirals, and uncomfortable moments then this is the flick for you. Don't expect anything uplifting in the end either, it leaves off feeling unfinished.
B00BBI9WD6|5.0|I have a 1st edition of this classic Honor Harrington.  I was glad to see it available for my Kindle. I can read it again and leave my good copy on the shelf.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|I love this game.  It gets our hand and eyes working together.  Some levels are harder then others, but it's worth the work.
B002VPE1WK|5.0|Perfect, many pockets for cleaning kits/paperwork. I can have everything in here and have my hands free =) I love this bag so far!
B00BTHWFBK|5.0|Well, the album starts off with some seriously heavy riffage.<br />A literal bang if you will.<br />I'm not going to go into a song by song breakdown as many other reviewers have already done that.<br />Sabbath really went back to the debut album's sound.<br />This IS doom.<br />The doom that has inspired legions of bands.<br />Long, droning with plenty of punch.<br />Sabbath really nailed it on this album.<br />Stand out tracks are for me...all of them lol.<br />Even the bonus tracks are good.<br /><br />Tony's sound is vintage heavy.<br />Geezer's bass is loud and pounding.<br />Brad fills in nicely.<br />And good old Ozzy sounds blessedly non-auto tuned.<br />The production is fine by me, nice and clear.<br />All in all this album fits in nicely with the bands earliest masterpieces.<br />It's the 70's all over again.<br />I never thought this album would ever happen but it did.<br />Do some of the songs sound like the classics?<br />Well, yes but common......these guys are pushing 70 and they're still doing it better than 99% of the acts out there nowadays.<br />This album is about as close to perfect as you can get.<br />Sit back and give it a fair shake.
B0014YVC6W|5.0|Short Circuit is a great movie to enjoy, when i was a kid i saw this movie and i loved it completely. im happy to have purchase this movie and now i can enjoy it for along time.
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|this game is so entertaining and easy to use, you also can go through the whole game without using real money! it was a great buy and I have already gotten two people hooked in the game! I definitley recommend it!
B00BQ1DAHC|5.0|this is an upcoming group and I really liked this whole album. I would suggest this album purchase to anyone that loves alternative rock.
B007XIC1GI|3.0|Just another sexdrugsandrocknroll autobiography. When you've read one, you've read them all. Nothing particularly memorable about this one, I'm sure I'll have forgotten it by tomorrow.
B000002GB4|5.0|I loved this album. I grew up listening to this music in my teens and youth and it brought back lots of memories and I still love listening to this type of music. I still love the 80s hair bands.
B009X010RU|4.0|Great color, easy to slip Kindle into it. Works best on a firm surface. Does not work so well when I use it while in bed.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I chose this rating because it was earned! I would read this book and series over and over again! I recommend every one to read this book.... not only is it something to read and enjoy.... it could be real..... overall, there is nothing to dislike about the book or series... it'll keep you on your toes.... wondering what will happen next!
B001ANSSDC|5.0|I really enjoyed this book and waited to see the movie until I read the novel first.  The book and movie are quite different, and although the movie is great, the book is WAY better.  I was intrigued the whole time and was disappointed to see it come to an end, which by my standards, makes for a great book.
B00170F0WU|1.0|Hated it, I'm going to see if Amazon will refund my money, save your money this movie is a waste of time. I only rented it because a couple of websites rated in the top 100 movies of all times. The Amazon rating system made me put in one star, I really give The Professional zero stars !
0062127241|5.0|An excellent autobiography by one of Rock music's greatest songwriters. Townshend calls himself a Seeker in this book and its clear why. The book describes his childhood including a kooky aunt and some veiled hints at abuse. After that we read about how The Who was created and how it rose to fame on the back of Townshend's genius for song writing. The usual rock star excesses are described (recall Keith Moon was there...) including cars being driven into hotel swimming pools, sexual escapades, TV's and hotel rooms being destroyed and the hilarious description of an LSD experience Townshend has on an airplane with Keith Moon.<br />But the theme that really holds this book together is that of a gifted musician who is always seeking for answers. This is evident in Townshend's description of his following of the guru Meher Baba (I struggled to understand the fascination, but Townshend clearly saw Baba as a spiritual guide). It is also seen in Townsend's attempts to write music with a thematic concept. In this he describes his successes - Tommy and Quadrophenia as well as his \\"failures\\" - the Lifehouse project. We also see a bit of the Seeker as Townshend explains his incident of being investigated for underage web site access which he was accessing as a part of a project to understand his own childhood. He acquits himself on this difficult point in this book, I believe.<br />The book also describes Townshend's family life and his marriage to Karen Astley which lasted a very long time despite all the rock star escapades.<br />All in all, a great story of a man seeking higher truths and writing songs millions enjoyed. Thanks Pete!
B0094BB4TW|4.0|This is a realy good app but there is 1 problem it has a little trouble of loading. It takes forever to load a picture. Even if u get to a point to see more it takes forever to load it a great app but it has that one problem
B00000K0T8|5.0|Anyone that enjoys the Wu-Tang Clan needs to own this CD, as it is a Wu-Tang release. Wu members abound throughout the album and with RZA producing too, its amazing. I'd Write the same review of Raekwon's first album Only Built For Cuban Linx that came out the same year as this. Dont forget Gza's Liquid Swords too, coming out in '95 also.
B00AO2P3GA|5.0|I think it's great but that only becuz I love shooter games but it also<br />CLASS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!:) ;)<br />Awesome cool and amazing
0316247545|5.0|It mostly just tells about all of the characters, main characters, And even some of the background characters. It also has some epic artwork from the creators of the show within it. I just got it today infact and I've already read though almost half of it... I've enjoyed it.<br /><br />Edit:<br /><br />The Sad part is from chapter 8 Onwards the book does not have anymore consept art or coments from the creators anymore... Its just a bunch of summery of the episodes themselves... I wish that they kept up with the thoughts from the wrighters and the pre post artwork but they did not. It was a missed opertunity to me as I love that kinda stuff. Other then that the book is very cool. The Cover is amazing to me and I love it still... Even if 2/3's of the book is just episode summerys.
0525478817|5.0|My daughter and I are both fan's of John's books.  This is probably my favorite of his.  It was my daughter's favorite book ever for a whole 3 months which is a big deal if you knew how much she reads.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Love the drama, the period,the casting and particularly the really superior acting. Just the thing for a night of total escapist entertainment but yet it gives you something to think about.
B002HJ9PTO|2.0|So many positive reviews. It ticks all the boxes for a mic on price, cable length and quality but whenever I use it I get noise in the background. Even in a quiet room.
B0088O11NU|2.0|its okay this game does have a tendency to get really boring after a while. Really ahrd to know what to do at first
B004XDYJRU|5.0|I get all kinds of stations not available on iHeart Radio from Herr Clear Channel.  Incuding the Current 89.3 ...the coolest
B005LAII80|5.0|Really wish I knew about this movie and saw it in 3D would have been amazing, blue ray still looks amazing. Fantastic movie, buy some for your friends so we can get a sequel!
0812550706|3.0|Not sure I'm glad I read this prior to movie or not! Although I could have guessed where it was going, I was a little surprised that it took \\"that\\" turn.<br />Anyway, it was a fun read and pretty quick. Since my edition included \\"Speaker for the Dead\\" I may just keep going and see what's next.
B00A81MV3U|5.0|This movie deals with mental illness in a very realistic, compassionate way.  I have bi-polar disorder just like the main character and I was able to relate to the story line with his struggles in getting out of the psych ward and dealing with his family. It has poignant moments but it is also a hilarious movie. Not to mention it was nominated for several Academy Awards including Best Picture for 2012 and Jennifer Lawrence got Best Actress for her portrayal of a young widow with problems of her own. It is a &#34;feel good&#34; movie and I have watched it several times--a must-see movie!!
B005GFPZYK|3.0|Interesting insight into the life of Chris Kyle and what it is like to be a Navy Seal and a Sniper.
B00B2V66VS|3.0|almost everytime I turn off my kindle and turn it back on then try to play this this won't load
B00D6BU8GG|4.0|I'm not sure why more didn't like it. I am an admitted Die Hard fan (with the exception of the second one, didn't care much for that one), so it may not be surprising.  I think the plot was decent, but the stunt work was insane.  The chase scene through moscow was crazy - not since Ronin have I found a chase scene so engrossing.<br /><br />Well worth the price of a rental.
B00BPWDMP2|5.0|What a great CD!!  These are original songs with a lot of feeling.  This is a fantastic group and I really enjoy them
B00AEBB8BU|5.0|I saw this movie in the theater when it came out in 1975 and it still holds up by today's standards. Redford and Dunaway have great chemistry. The action is tense and the story keeps you engaged throughout the film. I'm glad I added it to my movie collection.
B00756GRUE|3.0|This is a great item but I returned it. Date was unreadable and the watch was huge on my wrist. Except for that you certainly get  a good deal from Seiko and Amazon on this dive watch
B00992CF6W|5.0|it needs to be updated so I can have some new features like the apple products do why is it so slow on the kindle fire
B0028IDXDS|5.0|got this for my 6 month old daughter because she was having trouble with a traditional pacifier.  Once she dropped it in her crib, she couldnt get it back in her mouth again.  She is able to hold on to the monkey and easily finds her way back.  easy to wash clean.  I wish they used Nuk pacifiers, but this works fine. Ordering her another one!
B000JMKQX0|4.0|I merely wanted to read the book before seeing the movie. Not sure that was a good idea, but I got a kick out of it. It certainly sparked my imagination.
B0034G4OYA|5.0|Storyplot and characters are great! Good for big kids, small kids and toddlers, my 3 year old daughter really enjoyed it!!
B009YG2ND8|1.0|Look my Nanna and pappa said Fantasy is evil look the reason is witch craft wizards its evil that's the  reason satin and demons trick you into Fantasy don't play with wizards and witch craft games I used to play Final Fantasy until my Nanna and Pappa told me.
B005LAIHR2|5.0|... Such like myself, you will love this one. And if you're an 80s fan, even more. Love Tom Cruise performance! And love new Mexican talent Diego Boneta :)))
B00CWY76CC|4.0|fun way to unwind ...but still makes you think!!  recommend for everyone!  co -worker told me about game because she knows I like hidden object games.  try it out!
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I am not going to recap the story line because so many others have already but I will say that I loved this book! It picks up right after reflected in you and the book flows really well. I love that we get to know not just Gideon and Eva better but also some of the other characters as well. I loved the story line and I fell even more in love with Gideon and Eva. I know this book has gotten a lot of negative reviews but so few of them really seem to have to do with the actual book but more with the fact that it was such a long wait for the book or that this is not the end of the series. The wait has nothing to do with this book in particular and the author had nothing to do with it; that is all on the publisher. And for the fact that there are 2 more books left in the series, I am thrilled that we get to spend more time with Gideon and Eva. If you don't want to spend the money on more books then don't buy them. How many people complained that there were not more books in the fifty shades series and now people are upset that there are going to be more books? If you are like I am, the more you love these characters and this series, the more excited you are that there are more books to look forward to.
B00AESN8XY|5.0|This game is one of my most favorite games ever. I have it on my ipod touch and on my Kindle Fire. Totally worth the dollar. I have got every disease on the game. Still have not beat the zombies yet. Stupid human defenders. If I could I'd give this game a TEN.
B008M721MS|5.0|Wow!!!!  You are going back a long way wanting me to write a review for something that I bought a long time ago.  Many brandies and gingers have gone down since those days.  I bought an IPAD3 since but I still use the Kindle for knitting charts, it is so very comfortable on my knees knitting, yes really, I am a guy and knitting, it takes away the worry that I have with a very sick wife.
B008Q09K2U|2.0|Getting a little sick of Corey  - PLEASE Mr DeMille, refresh your characters and your style. Have loved that &#34;smart a...&#34; for years, but needs to be killed off.
B008UCJ7KO|3.0|This was not such a good book as the other ones. Now we have to wait for almost a year for the next book!
B00AWJYJVA|4.0|A typical Le Carre novel, with emphasis on the inadequacies of the heroes and the hidden warts of the villains.
B008N1V11U|2.0|I wish all the rave reviews were not for graphics alone. The game is horribly glitchy and extremely generic. The game basically goes out of its way to make the game difficult, but not in a fun way. The camera is horrible. It basically does whatever it wants. The grapnel doesn't shoot where you intended sometimes and the fighting is not up to par to any of the console titles as some reviewers have suggested. Good graphics for a Kindle Fire  HD game, but it basically stops there.  Would not have bought if I had a chance to preview it at first.
0684857219|5.0|This book is a definite must read for anyone who is series about bodybuilding or just getting in shape. The book covers everything from the beginning of bodybuilding to what its come to today. It breaks down how to workout each individual major body group down to the last detail. It also has great tips on dieting, benefits of doing one exercise compared to another, and the benefits of using things such as wrist wraps, belts, or gloves. What I really enjoyed was it had photos from body building legends during their competitions, Arnold shows how the competitions were just as big of a mental game as it was physical.

B0013TXA5Y|5.0|This book is packed with action. This book places you right into a well developed story and takes you for a wonderful ride. The ending is out of the blue but I am still in love with this book.
0802130208|1.0|I was expecting something amazing while reading this book, but it was incredibly stupid and not worth the time. Needless to say I did not finish reading it, after about midway, because I kept waiting for a point and it never came. It also was nasty and the main character was crude and it gave the illusion of him doing things that just do not need to be pictured in my mind. I was expecting something great and was extremely let down.
B00C5W3SBE|4.0|First, mostly these aren't really reviews of the MOVIE itself...which is what most people expect from Amazon. Instead what you are getting is a backlash against Disney for selling the Blu-ray and 3D Blu-ray separately. Then there are those who are comparing it to the classic 1939 movie \\"The Wizard of Oz\\", sure to be on everyone's favorite list who watched it, growing up in the 60's and 70's. Fine. But this is a modern take on the Oz legend, different to be sure, but if judged solely on it's own merits is a worthy blockbuster of an Oz movie.<br /><br />Some are quibbling about the casting and the name of Robert Downey Jr., who was being courted for the role of Wizard, comes up. But really this is James Franco's moment to shine...after all, he wanted to do the movie. Downey did not. The rest of the cast fill their roles admirably. Mila Kunis is given the unenviable task of recreating the role made famous by Margaret Hamilton...but while there is a certain homage to that characterization, Kunis is also branching out into uncharted territory. It may take a few viewings to get used to, but clearly she is having fun and so will anyone with an open mind.<br /><br />The look of this movie is really like no other movie in recent times. They really could have remade the '39 classic with the careful approach to detail on display here. Kids will get a real jolt out of the story, action, and pyrotechnics. Adults who are not jaded by so many \\"event\\" movies like this one clearly is, will find it worth watching again. Own it!
B00002SSKI|5.0|I grew up watching this moving with 3 other girlfriends and we were known as the Now and Then crew.  I love this movie, but when I popped it in to watch with my kids ages 5-9, I quickly turned it off, because it's intended for teenagers and adults.
159463176X|3.0|When I first began to read this book that I had been looking forward to for so long, I told everyone I knew what an amazing storyteller this author is and I had such high expectations of it continuing to be another great book by one of my favorite authors.  I actually loved the beginning so much that I re-read some of the sections because they were so beautiful.  In fact, many brought tears to my eyes.  All of a sudden, the book took a DRASTIC downturn once he began the next section where he began to develop the story about Pari's adoptive parents, Nabi and Mr. Wahdati.<br /><br />It got even worse once he began the story about Markos and Greece since I didn't care about those characters at all.  The writing style of the rest of the book changed drastically and was not as heartfelt and meaningful as his usual writing.  I do not want to give away the plot but I was expecting to read more about Abdullah and Pari's lives and hated the way the story rambled on and veered away from them and went in a totally different direction.  We only got back to the original characters at the very end and the entire middle section of the book was terrible. There was too much focus on unnecessary characters.  It was also hard to keep track of the way he was jumping around between the characters and decades too. I really did not even want to finish the book but I kept thinking I would miss something considering how wonderful the beginning was and how much I loved his first 2 books.<br /><br />If anyone reading this review has not read his 2 previous books, read them now because they were fabulous.  This could have been another truly spectacular book but it left me very frustrated.  I would not recommend this book at all since it was a great disappointment after his 2 other remarkable books.

B00BN3DPQ4|2.0|Ahnold has always entertained me, from seeing him in Pumping Iron as a kid and then Conan, the Terminators, Total Recall, a few other fairly fine films, and then of course perhaps his dramatic apogee as Mr. Freeze, a role that clearly would have received the Oscar nod if it was anyone other than Ahnold. But then Hollywood's anti-Austrian sentiment has never been a big secret.<br /><br />Sadly, Arnie's performance here is not quite up the lofty standards of Mr. Freeze, or even Lou Ferrigno (or Lou's dad). This may in fact be the worst on-screen work Arnie has ever done, which in its own way is quite a statement. But from the ham-handed and beyond ridiculous script to the millions of spent casings littering the screen, The Last Stand stands, staggers and then falls as Ahnold's nadir.<br /><br />(And the blu-ray is terrible as well, not one special feature or commentary. Message to studios: trailers are NOT special features!)<br /><br />Nothing makes sense in The Last Stand in any way, which would be fine if it wasn't trying to. But the Govanata is taking semi-serious aim here at the Mexican drug cartels, political correctness, feds and a bunch of other things, and misses on almost every count. The cartels are apparently staffed and headed by Europeans; the feds and other branches of Arizona law enforcement don't know how to get to the Arizona border within a few hours even when huge shootouts erupt (well, that might be true); guys like Knoxville have insanely felonius machine guns ready to go at any moment, and a few thousand rounds to stick in them; and many other truly nonsensical plot points. I know, it's all supposed to be crazy fun, but if Arnie wants to get political about it all, which he does here, portraying himself as a Clint/Gary Cooper kind of sheriff saving the American Way, he could at least make a stab at semi-believability. You know, like Mr. Freeze.<br /><br />And why is Forest Whittaker in this? He plays it as he always does, painfully serious, and derails the possible comedy while highlighting how sadly unserious this whole enterprise is. Strange casting choice. \\"Ah vant to act with a SEERIOUS acta!\\"<br /><br />The most notable thing to me was that TLS is the first Ahnold film where he not only doesn't flirt with women, but goes out of his way to barely notice them at all in a male-female sort of way. Still stinging from his bonking-the-maid scandal, the mighty Schwarz is merely polite to every woman in the film. Ahnold the Gelded! It's hard to see him now and not think of the cigar-chomping maid-bonking Governator, no matter how hard he tries to polish his image, such as it is.<br /><br />Maybe the worst moments here are when Ahnold pauses and almost yells at us, \\"Ahm goin to make anotha classic Ahnold statement nowww, pleeez listen und then loff und cheer like you should!\\". Then he'll utter something typically Ahnold...but the old get-in-tha-choppa magic is gone, and now it just feels overdone with the humor removed. Hasta la vista, Arnie.<br /><br />All in all, I expected a hare-brained adventure and that's what this is, except the hare is a tiny little buuny wabbit with a bwain the size of a pea. Nothing really works except Knoxville, who plays his role purely for laughs with the sort of mindless glee and disregard for reality that the whole movie should have had. Instead, it takes itself too seriously times ten and ends up being just plain stupid.<br /><br />Poor Ahnold. He probably won't get the Oscar for this one either.<br />If he's smart he'll give up action and politics and stick to the comedy, where he truly belongs.<br />Imagine if Mr. Freeze went to the melting polar ice caps.<br />Extremely heavily armed, of course. And all the women in parkas.erails the possible comedy while highlighting how sadly unserious this whole enterprise is.

B0094BB4TW|5.0|Helps me keep up with friends and family.  Wish people would keep their political views to themselves, though.  This should be for fun and information.
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|Not as good as the first book of the hunger games trilogy but easily as well written.  What I didn't like was how dark the story ended up becoming.  I'd recommend to an older group of teens but not to the fourth and fifth graders who seem to be its target.
B008KP6ENE|5.0|Best game in my experience. You can customise your own paper man. But not as much levels in the game. It would be a fun game to play in your spare time, but not for long time as in a year.
B0019TSI8W|3.0|This movie is dated, but it has a different twist than most.  The characters are exaggerated, but it's a nice light movie when you want something light-hearted.
B00AE9UYJ4|4.0|It's awesome it's just like the real game but you look around without that many sprites<br />I say you should get this games if your a fan of slenderman but hopefully in chapter 2 there's more maps<br />MUST BUY !!!!!!!!!!!!
B008YZ4RR0|4.0|I enjoy the character of Jesse Stone, an LA cop who moved to a small MA town after he lost his job due to a drinking problem.  The movie has interesting characters and a good mystery.
0399159347|4.0|Liane Moriarty's The Husband's Secret would probably be classified by most people as \\"women's fiction\\", but it's very good women's fiction.  Three women - Tess, Rachel and Cecilia - are bound together by events in their collective past.  Cecilia, who appears to have everything (career, great husband, kids) discovers a letter, written by her husband, that on the surface looks like it might change her life, and indirectly influence Tess and Rachel's lives as well.  Rachel has been existing, rather than living, since the murder of her teenage daughter Janie some years ago, and Tess has been dealt a blow by her husband Will, after he reveals that he's in love with someone else. Cecilia is placed in the unenviable position of having to decide whether to read the letter, destroy it, or put it back where she inadvertently found it.<br /><br />I liked the ideas that Moriarty explores in this book - similar to Kate Atkinson's recent Life After Life - that if we made some small change to something we did or said in the past, everything would have turned out differently.  Even if it's as small as leaving 10 minutes earlier to avoid traffic, timing can be everything.<br /><br />I have to admit I did not love this book as much as Moriarty's past work, specifically What Alice Forgot (which I thought was brilliant) and The Hypnotist's Love Story.  Both of those books engaged me more emotionally than this book did.  I think what didn't work for me in this one was the juxtaposition of the tragic aspects of the story with the very mundane day-to-day existence of the characters; it seemed at times like a soap opera.  In her previous books I felt she was able to bring together the drama and the ordinary parts of life in a more cohesive way.  I hate to say it but the brief epilogue was more interesting than the rest of the book.  However, I enjoyed it and I do recommend it.  Moriarty is a very good writer and even a less-than-great book of hers is better than many books I have read recently.  I'd also recommend checking out her previous work as mentioned above.ntly.  I'd also recommend checking out her previous work as mentioned above.
B008HK3XYK|5.0|I really like the case. It is comfortable to hold, doesn't slip out of my hand. I like that you open it & the Kindle turns on.
B000FVE3AC|5.0|The automatic movement is wonderful.  The heft and fit/finish are just fine.  I love the shade of blue.  The clasp is not what it would be on a watch for ten times the money.  The detail on the crown and lugs are appreciated.<br /><br />The crystal back shows the extra machining/decoration on the rotor, and even a good polish on the gear surfaces. Looks expensive inside.<br />It keeps excellent time, and you do not have to be jogging an hour a day to keep it wound.  Although the list price seems inflated on Invictas generally (IMO), the reality is that this one is at LEAST a $400 watch for $120.00  I would buy a $200 version if they had one, with a fancier clasp.<br /><br />for $300 more, it would glow in the dark better maybe, work as well, maybe, have a better clasp, and cost $300 more.  It is EASY to spend $500 and get much less watch.  With all of my choices, this is the one I find myself wearing a LOT.  I take it off for gardening to avoid scratching the steel unreasonably.
B00C1XZ2LQ|5.0|This soundtrack is actually entertaining all by itself, and I've listened to it several times while I work.  M83 really made a work of art here, much in the same way that Daft Punk made Tron: Legacy's soundtrack more than just background sound.  If you like instrumental music, you'll really appreciate this.  The last song featuring Susanne Sundfør is great.

Some of it is obvious but it helps frame relationships and figure out how you can break patterns.<br /><br />All of us want to feel love.

B003RT0NK8|3.0|It was a decent movie that covered just another way that the end of the world can happen. The one thing that bothered me was the ending when the villain was shown... blurred out... didn't like that.

B0081336FO|5.0|It's a very good production, very enjoyable. I'm really disappointed that this is all there is. It is suspenseful and well written.
B003H4I4JU|4.0|For those who enjoyed &#34;Enders Game&#34;, this novel picks up far in the future after that novel ends.  The main character, however, is still alive.  He plays a key role in helping another species of intelligent beings survive and flourish.  Interesting book.
B00CWVG1Z8|3.0|I give the special effects a thumbs up. But the romantic side of the movie was too silly. I think if you are a fan of those twilight saga movies, then you might like this. I hated twilight so there ya go.
B008JFUUQ2|5.0|One of the funniest movies to come along in a long while.  I love the cast ans the writing is fantastic.
B002MFX27E|5.0|I love this movie! This was the first movie I had ever seen Meryl Streep in, and as a comedic actress, she is HILARIOUS!! Goldie Hawn is great too. They're all great! The movie is a dark comedy that essentially makes fun of our fears about aging. As a horror film, it isn't too gory at all. And the use of special effects (especially for those days) is pretty advanced. A full five stars!
B0083SBMBM|5.0|I waited a year to watch this film because I wanted to see how it was without all the hype. And I'm glad to say it was everything I had hoped. Beyond awesome, I am looking forward to the next one!

B00AEFY66U|4.0|I loved the book when I was a boy, the movie when I was a Redford junkie and the 2013 movie which took every aspect to a higher level.

0064400557|5.0|I bought this as a read-to chapter book for my six year old Waldorf child. It's been 37 years since I read it and I still sobbed buckets just like the first time. It teaches the concept of lifetimes without any excess drama.
B00BTYP6QE|4.0|Great for kids!  Makes them think ahead.  Love to see them figure out the ways of getting the job done.
B00BTHWFBK|2.0|Not sure how this is getting such high ratings, I suspect a few reviewers might not go back far enough to appreciate some of the true milestones in heavy metal. If they did, they'd be as disappointed with this release as I am. Iommi is a hero of mine but hero worship won't get a pass for this one. I can't believe it took so many years to do this, there is nothing even remotely interesting going on. Paint by numbers riffs (some we've already heard), paint by numbers lyrics (some of them truly awful, see Pariah for example - who wrote this?), dry production and lame cover \\"art\\" (even \\"Born Again\\" has better art). I know they're older, but Ozzy's performance just doesn't cut it here on most of the tracks, he really phoned this one in. This doesn't require repeated listens, there's nothing here to sink in. Too bad, I was really looking forward to this. For a better metal album, get Super Collider instead (yes, it's not \\"Rust In Peace II\\", but it's pretty good and its better than this).

B004USRLRS|5.0|What a beautiful record-still as wonderful as the day it was released. Graham Nash still maintains his beautiful English  songwriting gift that he was born with on this lp. the reissue CD's are horrible! The best way to listen to this is on the original lp. That beautiful songwriting gift he developed when he was writing  with the Hollies is still alive on this recording. Packaging and photography, a work of art. Highly recommend.
B00CW665VI|5.0|I must admit I've been reading a lot of romance books lately.  I probably need to read other genres for a while. But, I'm so glad I read this one!  I love that a woman wrote a romance from a man's perspective.  I love that this book had me grinning (a lot) while reading and laughing out loud many, many times!  I love Drew's sense of humor.  See how I just used the word love 3 times while discussing the book?  I think it is a 5 star.  I really enjoyed the way the author wrote what Drew was thinking.  So yes, 5 stars for this romance book, which, after I read a few other genres, I will reread again, with pleasure.
B00BLGZN1S|5.0|Had alot of action - great movie for any guy!  Strong characters and plot.  A movie worth the price to rent.
B00785P2QC|5.0|This is an awesome app and it shreds the nar! I look forward to playing it everyday and cannot wait to build the city of my dreams. I would totally recommend it to a friend.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|First off, I have to say that I don't understand all the negative reviews for this book. Ms. Day stated some time ago that it was going to be a five book series, so if you didn't know that, than you must have been living under a rock.<br /><br />Secondly, I'm tired of people always stating that it's about the money. Honest to God, there is no pleasing you people. You complain because you want more of the series, but don't want to wait for it. Books aren't written in one day. And I love that it's going to be five books because I love Ms. Day's creativity and I'm curious to see where it will take us. Frankly, the more Gideon and Eva I get, the happier I am.<br /><br />As for the book, I enjoyed Entwined with You. I thought it was a great continuation of the series. Is it a stand alone book? No, you need to read the first two before this one. Are there loose ends? Yes, that's what happens in a series.<br /><br />I would love for Gideon and Eva to be able to put Nathan behind them. In the Cary/Trey/Tatiana triangle, I want Cary to end up with Trey. I can't stand Brett and I don't like the trouble he's causing. And speaking of trouble, I can't stand Corinne - she is such a drama queen and I don't like that she is interfering in Gideon and Eva's relationship. I'm curious as to what is happening with Megumi. I love Ireland and hope to see more of her in the coming books. But overall, I think this is a great cast of characters, even the ones I don't like because they are invoking strong emotions and wrapping me up in the story. Which is exactly what an author is supposed to do.<br /><br />So thanks to Ms. Day for letting me escape reality for a bit and become wrapped up in Eva's and Gideon's world. I look forward to seeing where you are going to take us on this journey.
B000LPQ6DE|5.0|I think this is the better of the two well known versions of this movie. It's just a personal preference of mine, there is more passion portrayed between these two actors in my opinion. The little girl in the movie is so sweet and endearing. Every actor in this movie enhanced it and added to the richness of it. Not to mention the scenery, set and costumes where beautiful to behold.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Khaled Hosseini is back on his game in &#34;...and the Mountains Echoed&#34;.  The compelling story both captures and educates readers, bringing alive generations of characters.  I rarely say this, but it is deserving of a second read!
B000HKT7RK|5.0|Can't go wrong with this classic. I grew up as a small child watching Julia with her frenetic motions and hyper animated voice, she along with my Mother got me interested in cooking at avery young age and by age 8 I was making a Rue and preparing a fish chowder entirely on my own thanks to the inspiration of Julia and my Mom.
B0095XPZBC|5.0|Having bought the previous DVD box set of this series, I have been most reluctant to lay down the money for yet another incarnation of this series.  However, Paramount has really pulled out all the stops with this and is - as all fans now know - recutting every episode with original footage for a true HD conversion.  They're doing a marvelous job, as readily evidenced by the crystal clear picture and graphics.  The colors jump out like never before, contrast is crisp, and the reconstruction of episode with the HD elements completely faithful to the originals in every way.  Watch for a sale; I wait until prices drop to $59-$61.

B005MHI0QM|5.0|I was fortunate enough to read this book on  my way to Amsterdam.  The first morning we were there we visited the Anne Frank house.  It was very emotional and surprising at how every detail in the book was there.  Anne Frank should be read by everyone.
B005S9EKCW|5.0|I almost feel like it's a disservice to this movie to leave a review. All I can say is that it's brilliant, the music is brilliant, the cinematography and special effects are brilliant... and Russell Crowe's voice is pathetic in an adorable sort of way. I got the combo pack so that I'd be able to have a digital copy, even though I have no use for the UltraViolet edition.<br /><br />I will say that the special features are a huge disappointment. I wanted to see all sort of epic features on how they filmed it, and behind-the-scenes featurettes, but there was nothing of the sort. Just a few measly little documentary-style features. BIG bummer on that end. &#60;sigh&#62;
B006BDHAX0|3.0|I do not like the tiles (there are three styles) on this version although the game works well.  There are several configurations you can select from

B000SGSU58|5.0|I simply love all the Harry Bosch books. Each book is different<br />and highly engaging. This book has lots of twists.
B003DES8I6|5.0|Awesome. Norman Reedus is so hot and the movie is funny but action all in one. A must see but watch the first one first or it won't make sense.
B0017VG69U|5.0|So glad to have these classics of my childhood in a great format!  These disks are packaged in a very attractive case that makes one proud to own them!

0385484518|4.0|Loved Tuesdays with Morrie. Found it thought provoking and quite sad in parts, although it was also quite happy at the same time.
B005S9EKCW|5.0|If you love a good soundtrack, this movie has it! The acting and cinematography is superb! The story is great as well.
B0050DZN4K|5.0|I was sad when google reader announced its close, but feedly has replaced it for me, and done a great job
B00A8MGLAI|4.0|Having read the book this is based on, and given that a trailer for the film was what turned me onto reading it in the first place, I set out to see the movie. I found it to be an excellent adaptation, all things considered. Things were changed, sometimes significantly, but a straight translation would have been impossible to pull off. In every case I could see why they made the decisions they did and it made sense. This is a very unique movie, and not one you can watch casually. It will take a significant amount of brainpower just to follow the six different stories being presented simultaneously, let alone the various themes and recurring elements tying everything together. You may want to watch it a second time. Maybe more.<br /><br />First things first: I absolutely loved it. How much of that had to do with the fact that I enjoyed the book I cannot say, but I highly recommend both versions of this tale. That said, they are two very different experiences. The book, briefly, is structured as a Russian nested doll-six stories, each breaking off at the halfway point and the next beginning until you reach the last one, then revisiting each story in reverse order. Picture six loosely-connected novellas arranged chronologically, then each one opened to the middle and stacked on top of each other. While the film tells the same stories, its structurally more of a mosaic, cutting from era to era in such a way as to emphasize thematic parallels or moments of recurrence. For example, we cut from our dystopian-future tale where our heroes are running across a narrow bridge to the South Pacific where another character is racing through the rigging of a sailing clipper ship. A lot of subplots got cut and elements of the main plots were cut up or rearranged to streamline the flow and allow everything to happen within a reasonable runtime, and the entire ending of the Somni-451 tale was rewritten so that it better fit the thematic emphasis of the film. Additionally, whereas thereincarnation of a single \\"soul\\" across all six stories in the book was a minor theme, the film decided to make this a major element of the film and highlight it by casting the same actors in most/all (depending on the actor) of the stories. Thus the reincarnation theme links each character played by a particular person instead of the six protagonists. I have to say, this was a very risky decision on the part of the filmmakers, but for my money it paid off. I'll say more about this when I talk about the actors and the makeup jobs.<br /><br />The performances from the various cast members were simply phenomenal. It takes a lot of skill to convincingly play one character in a film, let alone six unique and complicated characters....at the same time. A lot of credit is also due to the makeup department for the work they did, especially in turning changing actors/actresses sexes or white actors asian and vice versa. Turning the asian actresses white didn't work quite as well-Doona Bae's character in 1800s California looked very exotic, for example. She was incredibly beautiful, but I don't think anyone would mistake her for fully caucasian. (Please understand this is not meant in any way to promote racism-the fact is that certain racial backgrounds come with distinct facial characteristics. Not better, not worse, just different. Everyone on board? Good, lets stop wasting time....) In fact, even if nothing else in this review grabs you, you should see this film just for Hugo Weaving (Lord of the Rings' Elrond, The Matrix's Agent Smith) as the tyrannical female head nurse at a retirement home.<br /><br />This film is rated R, for good reason. There is some disturbing violent content that is a bit gory, the language is definitely R-rated (though not as bad as many other films I've seen), and there is some sexual content and nudity. I didn't find it gratuitous, as in every case it served to advance the plot, enhance the worldbuilding or even evoke certain thematic elements,but viewers should be advised nonetheless.
B00BGIC2J2|4.0|Very timely, if you are forty+. Try to get the unrated version of this movie. It has unedited scenes which are truly funny.
B00AQF8CJ0|5.0|Terrific little game.  The mechanics are simple: typo slide little pudding blobs into each other so that they stick together in a structure that both covers the three stars the level and uses all the blobs.  If a blob runs of the edge, you have to start over.  As the game progresses, you get different kinds of blobs, such as blobs that leave a sticky trail, or that need to be composed together.  Some of the puzzles require more thought than others, but none are unreasonably difficult.  Will worth $0.99.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I really like this app! You just cant put it down. Cant wait for more levels. Not to hard and not to easy.
B009XIXVU6|3.0|Book has the familiar theme from Hosseini about Afghani family life torn apart by the wars there but story not as riveting as The Kite Runner.
B0000257MA|4.0|the cd works great, came when it was supposed to. Only thing was the case was a little damaged. But all in all, I love this album!!! \m/
B004H4XI5O|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed reading Mr. Foer's adventure in the world of memory techniques and competitions.  It was interesting following his path and the challenges and successes he had along the way.  Also, I loved the interviews with his mentors and competitors.  I liked Mr. Foer's questions and that he let the answers stand for themselves.  The other material he provides to put these memory processes into perspective was interesting, particularly for readers who have (or could) a passing interest in neuroplasticity.  I will definitely be recommending this book to others.  Put simply, I just really enjoyed the time I spent reading this book and I highly recommend it.  I look forward to reading about Mr. Foer's next adventure.
B00BFUUMO8|3.0|There are a lot of annoying &quot;time-gated&quot; moments while playing this mild dinosaur fantasy park builder game. You don't really need &quot;friends&quot; to help you, but it's a minor perk if you do have friends who participate. The game does have more than one currency to use in the in-game shop, but if you play smart you don't have to spend a single penny on it.<br />The Code Red moments shortly breaks up the pace of the game, but I wish there were more interactive moments that could have made the game more charming and fun to play. The underwater park adds a little bit more to the game but not by much. The story can be amusing at times, but the missions are repetitive.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Very simple game but get addicting. Makes you think a bit but then you see it. Not much of a challenge when you make an error but gave it 5stars because I can't stop playing
B003SNKBXW|4.0|I'm born in Argentina, so spanish is my language from birth. It was very interesting reading this tranlation to english of the classic by Perez Reverte. Saddly the kindle version has some broken paragraphs, repeated words and typos, so I give it four stars.
B003TSEEDY|3.0|There are moments of clarity in this book that are so powerful for any reader, no matter your age. This book is about real life. People should say these honest things more often.
075695195X|4.0|Bartimaeus is a djinn.  He has a wide range of powers that would be most appealing to a young wizard stepping into the magical realm for the first time.  Nathaniel has been with his master for the past six years, but feels as though he has been left on his own to learn how to be a wizard.  After being humiliated by a renown wizard, he vows revenge on his perpetrator.<br /><br />There is no doubt that Nathaniel is quite a bright young wizard.  He has mastered skills far beyond his years, yet he hasn't learnt the morality and responsibilities that come with great power.  His teacher was not a suitable mentor.  Bartimaeus turns out to be a far better teacher if only Nathaniel would pay attention to him.<br /><br />Much of what our young wizard does is motivated by his quest for revenge.  Like many kids his age, 12, he acts on impulse without thinking through the consequences.  Very typical behaviour for his age group.<br /><br />I enjoyed that this story was set in a magical version of modern day London, England.  Wizards are the politicians of the day.  Perhaps this isn't so far off when I consider certain politicians.<br /><br />One thing bothered me about this story.  The wizards learned all sort of spells/incantations/ drawings, but the real power/magic belonged to the djinn and their ilk.  The wizards didn't really do the magic.<br /><br />This book would have most appeal to a male pre-teen reader, though there is a mysterious female character of the same age, that we meet a few times, and I suspect that she will play and increasing role in future books in this trilogy.<br /><br />I listened to the unabridged audio book from Lending Library.  Read by Simon Jones.  13 hours 30 minutes.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This book is the best of the three.  The multiple subplots are satisfactorily closed, leaving a better, but reasonably tenuous future for the citizens of PanAm.  I would recommend this book for thoughtful group discussion.
B005I3PAUO|3.0|The story line was okay but John Puller is not  as interesting as Lee Child's Jack Reacher. Can't help thinking that this is an idea derived  from  the Jack Reacher series.
B00C1N9JWO|5.0|This was definitely awesome! At first I want so sure, for the first 20% of the book I have to say I was pretty bored and really thought oh my gosh this book is going to s@ck!! Trust me push through, this story is one of those that makes you feel a wide range of emotions. I definitely recommend this book but only as part of the series.
B009UNGYHG|5.0|IT charges it and gives it the boost it needs defiantly worth the money. It is a Strong and very durable case.
B0049P1VHS|4.0|The Complete First Season was a good buy and I love the show and the episode with this one, but it really is rather expensive for just getting the first 8 or so episodes.
B0053FANS6|5.0|The video and sound rock. The special effects for all three were awesome...too bad they changed up the Mummy paradym...
1400049628|5.0|Great book for learning and teaching.  Loved the seriousness of it and the fact that it may or may not be a &#34;what if&#34; situation, but it's treated with respect and dignity and will legitimately assist in surviving if zombies were ever to become a threat.
B00AQKEPMI|5.0|I watched this with the wife. Darn movie made me cry and made her laugh at me. Darn heart-string puller. Kick ass grfx and sound. Can't miss with this one.
B00AESN8XY|4.0|I have purchased plenty of .99 cent games and wondered why I paid that much for them. This is \\"Not\\" one of those. This game rocks. I can't wait for more expansions.
B00785P2QC|5.0|This game is fun and exciting love how it feels and looks real! Wouldn't ever stop the game.  Wish it had more avatars in it. But I still love this game. A++++++++
B0049J2CKE|5.0|This is one of our absolute favorite family movies~ good for all ages.  A great reminder of the importance of loyalty and friendship.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I have read this book before but I just wanted to catch up and reread all the excitement loved it
B00AQL8VU4|5.0|It's a good app, I find the things I need it works well. It's an amazon app, cmon it's not going to be bad, or else people wouldn't use it.
B0054R6BFM|2.0|I found the concept interesting enough but the book was very difficult to follow for me while switching between clay and Hannah. I found myself confused too offer and the book was frustrating for me.
B002JVWR4A|5.0|Thank you for fast delivery it makes 2 of 8 for my collection, not in ordered but its the way I ordered it. Thank you again.
B007A4SDCG|3.0|Point of this book was really good and it can definitely help many people struggling with their creative process. However I did dislike the way it's presented. It was like watching some american training exercise video or something like that. However I still would recommend it to pretty much everybody who does anything artistic (write, paint, music, anything). Lot's of good points in there. Just remember, it's not the whole truth.
B0006IUDXA|5.0|I've been a fan of Richard Dean Anderson ever since I first watched MacGyver. I've been waiting for the price to come down so I could get the full seasons at a price I could afford. I had VHS versions that I copied from TV but it's nice to see these shows without the commercials and all the little things they cut out to make room for the commercials. I always loved the way Mac used his head to get out of situations and didn't use guns. These are worth watching over and over again.
B003FXCSNQ|5.0|This is the first book I've read from Philip K. Dick and gotta say, it was good. It's not a long read but really spins your head and gives you these weird insights on stuff you can't really put in words.
0486211045|5.0|First off.  The retailer got me the book in three days.  I didnt pay additional to have it expedited, so that was a plus.  As far as the material goes.  Buy this book.  There is a reason that Bridgman is know and recomended by so many professional and aspiring artist.  I hadnt had this book a month and already improved my anatomy line work considerable.  The sketches are very much in the Frank Frazetta style. Not a whole lot of dialogue instruction but multiple angles of each part of the body and for a visual learner like myself. Extremely insightful.  I read where a lot of people note that you already have to have a clear understanding of anatomy.  Well i have purchased quite a few books that go in long, long anatomy detail and i am not a professional artist by any means. This series of books along with Loomis and Hampton seem to be the way to go if you want to really get a grasp.  Just my opinion.  I am very glad i purchased this book. I would use this seller again, no question.
B006VFLIYK|5.0|Really enjoyed this book.  Didn't figure the ending out in advance of reading it.  Couldn't put it down got sucked in and kept reading.
B008KP6ENE|5.0|I really like the old school side scrolling games, and this one is of the better ones on Android. Good controls, great game play.  Some things are easy but there are other things that make up for it with a good challenge.  The graphics are great and love the 3D backgrounds when you go to the background.  I highly recommend.  Works great on my Asus Infinity Tablet and my Droid Razr Maxx phone.    I just wish it was available on FireTV
B00499NHLC|5.0|Intense, humorous, modern version of classic Holmes - it all adds up to enjoyable and FUN!!  Loved it and can't wait to see season 2.
B006M4F67A|5.0|I have played a few different Mahjong games on Android, and this was my favorite yet.  And some are challenging.
B00APJLFEG|5.0|I love this movie, my children (ages 6 and 8) also love sitting down to watch it. Has comedy, love and friendship. It's not over done and has a freshness to the film.. Well done!
B0070DOHQS|5.0|I wasn't sure about it at first, but gave it a go, and glad I did.  Easy setup, and easy to use for me for my WIndows 7 PC and my Windows 8 Laptop connection.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I was disappointed with the viciousness of the reviews.  Read it, LOVED it.  If anyone who may have been a fan of Fifty - and EL James came out with 2 more, you bet your tail they would buy the others.  Sylvia is going to give us MORE and people are disappointed?  Really?  I love when the characters come to life and jump out of the pages.  Thankfully Eva and Cross have more to say. I can't wait to hear it and will gladly pay 9.99 more for each book.  I would have spent it anyone trying to find more books to enjoy.  Worth the wait and worth the money.  YOU GO Mr & Mrs Cross!!!!!!
B003G8Y4QO|5.0|I can't stop watching each episode! I have to force myself to turn off the Xbox and TV. I try to limit myself to 2-3 episodes a day now. The Doctor rocks!
B000MQC9H4|5.0|Great price and it plays great. I love this movie. It was a gift for myself.I totally love it.its a great movie.
B00BGIC2J2|1.0|Wow, what a huge waste of time. It was over two hours - could have been 30 minutes less and we'd still get the story. It's about a couple who are starting to fall apart. There was no chemistry and the fighting was gratuitous. Some funny things but overall it was not a feel good or good movie.
B005G4TJUC|5.0|I'm so happy that I found this movie to finish my collection. I am a big fan of the Transformers franchise.
B00BWBHIUG|4.0|My grandkids enjoy the lovely graphics and the colors are all Disney. Fun and easy for toddlers . Great for the times you need 2 to 4 minutes to check out at the grocery store.
B00CQGU9GG|4.0|I won't bother rehashing disdain for the \\"techno mixing\\" done on the ZZ Top Six Pack - suffice to say, the label at least went back to the sound of the original recordings (other reviewer comments about brickwalling aside - I'm not going to get into that part of it). My one and only complaint - if you're going to go to the trouble of putting out a high profile box set release and trumpet the restoration of the original sound, why cheap out on the other stuff? Each disc comes in a cardboard sleeve that emulates the original LP but no protective paper sleeve for the discs - why? And no liner notes for each disc - why? They could have at least combined all that information in a booklet and included it in the box (see the much better done Blue Oyster Cult Complete Columbia Recordings for the proper way to issue a catalog spanning box set). Another fumble by the label but since it is about the music, I am happy to have copies that don't have that horrible remix sound from the 80s. Dinged one star for a missed opportunity on packaging.
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|this game is great and challenging!it is very fun.even my 3 year old little brother loves it.great game for kids like me.

B0010SKUYM|5.0|I couldn't put this book down.  PERIOD! A fantastically dark, witty and epic tale of a young man's amazing journey.<br /><br />Can't wait to get started on the sequel.
B007HPO3CC|5.0|This is te way to watch a season!  All the characters and places that they are from or are in seem easier to follow watching the whole season play out in less thn a couple of days.  Good way to review what has happened.<br /><br />The product arrived in a timely fashion and in great condition,
B00785P2QC|5.0|very fun game aswell as a great time killer. if you a bored and want something to do while you wait this game is for you
B00DBSZ6ZC|5.0|Great action movie.  I loved this movie from beginning to end. I hope that there is a sequel to this one. I would love to see how Edward fits into the family.
B009JZWO3I|5.0|We enjoyed the multiple story lines going on at once. Cliff hanger is great. We will definitely get the next season

B00BGIBVP8|5.0|i laughed literally the whole way through. pacy sharp  dialogue and no schmaltz - relied on keen real observation rather than goofball laughs
B004RJMUJO|4.0|I really like it. I think it is rely fun to play. Even my 53 year old dad loves it.
B003M6FGTE|5.0|I hesitated to ever watch it, but I enjoy music and grew up with music. I am not overly critical of shows and try to watch for fun. I enjoy the music and that they sing and change up hit songs. It can be a turnoff that they focus so heavily on sex, drinking, etc. as that is not necessarily the high school experience, but I understand that they are trying to be educational as well... and let's face it, the media industry knows sex sells.
B00A8KJN14|5.0|this set is cool i bought it at best buy for 15.19 great price for an amazing combo pack the movie itself is n my opinion is awsome this 2 disc set is a great mash has a lot of bonus meterial as well
B001F7MSG6|5.0|Another great movie for everyone of course the exception of young kids wait till they are a little older both my son and daughter enjoy it

B0050DIWFC|4.0|All through this book as you read you hoped and wanted the parents to be rewarded for<br />their trust and love for their son.  The author made the characters seem real enough that you could feel their<br />pressure of to believe or doubt.  This is a story that stayed with me long after I finished reading.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game is the best tablet game I've been able to find lately, but my friends all tell me they got the new update and I haven't yet. I wish the updates came out faster. (My friends have the apple devises.)
B006SMLAMQ|5.0|Very handy when travelling. It not only tells you the weather where you're going for that day, but a 5 day outlook as well as hour-by-hour for the current day. That has helped us avoid some nasty weather driving stretches.

B00CKZX0AA|5.0|I'm a music consumer, an avid fan of anything that stirs emotion and evokes artistic awe in my mind. Hans Zimmer is the master of soundtracks that get your blood pumping, your mind thinking, your emotions stirred, and sends chills down your spine. This soundtrack is much like his other works. Just flat out fantastic. There are so many pieces of his music that trigger remembrances of past classical scores I have heard by various composers in classical/instrumental music, that I always feel at home, yet like I am in new territory. He seems to gather all of the pieces of my musical past that I love and cherish, and embody them in one soundtrack. I love this album for that very reason.<br /><br />This is the first full soundtrack I have bought of his, and I haven't even seen the movie yet. I almost bought Inception, but it didn't have the repeat play value for all tracks that this soundtrack has for me. If you like Hans Zimmers past work, you will love this soundtrack.
038533348X|5.0|What can one say about Kurt Vonnegut. He is a genius who shares his views, stories and experiences with us...and we are lucky as a result!
B007REV4YI|4.0|Good movie - different from the Bond flicks I grew up with.  MUCH fewer gadgets, MUCH more character development.  Interesting that instead of trying to make a prequel like Casino Royal, this goes far beyond.
B00000JCOV|4.0|Slipknot are frequently lumped into the already oversaturated nu-metal crowd, and while the Des-Moines, Iowa-raised group does have a nu-ish appearance (as each of these nine band members is clad in orange jumpsuits, makeup, and masks), and an anti-establishment-inspired, middle-digit-to-the-world anger about them, and is even occasionally heard taking musical ventures into nu-metal-esque territory (with a DJ and near-rapped vocals), they are miles and miles removed from the Limp Bizkits and Linkin Parks of the world. And true, their eponymous 1999 debut might also feature some Korn-esque downtuned guitars and Helmet-like stop-start rhythms.<br />But this record actually has as much (if not more) in common with the death and thrash genres than anything else. And heck, its intensity is so severe throughout that one might even argue that it borders on being worthy of grindcore.<br /><br />Frontman Corey Taylor wages war on his demons throughout these pummeling fourteen tracks, ranting and raging about various catalysts that set him off into the deep end over a uber-abrasive musical bed of bludgeoning riffs, rubbery bass, and brutal drumming -- yes, even including some death metal-derived blast beat drumming. (Joey cements his status as one of heavy music's premier young skinsmen by nailing brutal fills pretty much all throughout this hour-long playing time.)<br /><br />It all begins with \\"742617000027,\\" a simple (but loopy and trippy), sample-laden intro track which sets the stage and flows perfectly into \\"(Sic),\\" which oozes with pounding guitars, throbbing bass lines, and tight, pummeling blast beats. It also slips in some catchy and well-placed DJ scratches. And Corey tops it all off by coming screaming into (or, more accurately, over the top of) the mix, viscerally hollering lines like \\"You can't kill me!\\" (albeit without ever exactly explaining why anybody might want to), and climaxing with some skin-crawlingly maniacal laughter. \\"Eyeless,\\" then, is similarly filled with more positively crazy vocals, including some full-bodied, larynx-shredding bellows of \\"mother effer\\" that will be instinctively memorable, whether you want them to be or not.<br /><br />The record's lead single, \\"Wait And Bleed\\" is not exactly a power ballad, but it is about as close to being one as you're going to find on the album, as it is the catchiest (and cleanest) song to be had, here, and even features some genuine crooning from Taylor. But immediately following \\"W&B\\" comes the really scathing and livid \\"Surfacing,\\" which just might be the record's most extreme tune, and one that boasts the type of chorus that is easy to imagine going on to inspire ginormous mosh pits around the globe. Indeed, the headbanging intensity is so in the red throughout this track that the listener can feel it pulsing through their body, from their head to their toes. And following this up comes \\"Spit It Out,\\" another hit single, and an insanely catchy one at that, as it is filled with deft DJ scratching and swift, fluid rapping.<br /><br />You might call me crazy for saying this, but I feel like \\"Slipknot\\"'s second half does not seem to stack up quite as well as the first track did, as it feels like the energy level drops significantly. And there are is the occasional forgettable song to be found in it, too, including \\"Me Inside\\" and \\"Diluted\\" (although, to its credit, the former of these two cuts does feature some borderline soaring clean singing.) But there are certainly other standout tracks to be found, here, like the spooky, mind-trip of an interlude that is \\"Tattered & Torn\\" (and, subsequently, the spine-tingling \\"Prosthetics\\"), and \\"Liberate,\\" which is coursing with memorable, pummeling, churning, chest-caving guitar and bass riffs, and esophagus-shredding screams.<br /><br />And although not as memorable as the above, \\"No Life\\" is a surprisingly catchy, and (naturally) very mosh-intensive number; \\"Only One\\" features an excellent and epic energy build-up and climax; and \\"Scissors\\" is a sprawling, slowly-burning, nineteen-plus minute long epic that brings the album's curtain to a close with the sound of Taylor verging on full-fledged crying.<br /><br />The bottom line here is simple enough to understand because it all boils down to this: \\"Slipknot\\" is one heckuva debut, a landmark even, from an iconic band whose dark, angsty attitude defined a generation. So no matter what subgenre this album falls under, if you are into heavy music, it is definitely a must hear.
B005S9EKCW|5.0|Great performances, great movie. Really nice to be able to get all 3 versions (BR, Stnd-DVD, digital copy) in one package.
B00COGXGNQ|4.0|Hate to ruin the surprise, so I won't.  Just the right amount of romance and suspense.  I thought it was a chick flick, so I watched by myself, then hubby decided to join in and really enjoyed it!
B0017O1MIM|5.0|This is truly one of the best films of the century. It belongs in everyone's movie collection. The book that comes in the package is also a collectors dream and is filled with the background stories and thought processes of the director and his actors. It is incredibly interesting and fascinating. The quality of the images and sound is equal to the best movie house. I have watched this film several times over the years and it never gets old or tiring. Watching my own DVD on my TV for the first time was amazing and thrilling. Thank you Amazon for offering this special film. I have been waiting for the latest and best version of this fine film and I finally have it in my possession. I received it in pristine condition and I am so pleased and utterly satisfied with my purchasing decision, with the product you delivered, with the amazing price for this movie and with my buying experience. If you don't own this film, you are missing out on a truly spectacular movie experience.
159463176X|4.0|This book started out with a great weave of story lines, and I was really looking forward to the finish. But it all seemed anticlimactic at the end. All I could gather from it was the sadness of a war torn country/people. A place and time where there aren't really any happy endings for people just trying to survive. At best, only happy moments. I will let this book rest awhile, and revisit it another time. Not my initial favorite of the three books, but not one to be discarded.....
B00D6BQPMM|5.0|This was so close to the book which made me super  happy!  I wouldn't have thought that a writer could make you empathize with the Dead but this movie makes you root for the zombies!
B005PK57NU|5.0|As usual, this show delivers. We like to &#34;go to Chicago&#34; every night we can. The lots are clever, and there's always a surprise lurking around the corner. Great characters, plot, dialogue
0425263924|2.0|The first and second book were great but this book was a complete disappointment. Not enough drama to keep me interested and that's a real kicker because I had been counting the days for the release date.
B00992CF6W|5.0|worth it but they need redstone (ore, dust, pistons, repeaters, torches) and easier ores to find and all of the mobs i,e, endermen and the ender dragon. finally, I would like Mojang to add more animals, and mobs
0062511408|4.0|Excellent book, everybody should have a dream and follow this dream without hesitation. Great understanding of human behavior and what it is important in your life
B00992CF6W|4.0|Great game.., My daughter loves it if only she could log on. She likes playing with a friend but cannot log on with hers.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|I absolutely love this game! I have never had any problems  with it. I play it on my kindle, iphone, and computer.
5699214127|5.0|Great book, beautiful cover. this would make a unique and beautiful gift item! The price is reasonable, taking to consideration the fact that this book was in hard cover, well packed and not damaged.
B000OXHRRC|5.0|Sat down with my girlfriend to watch this movie and came away both thoroughly enjoying it!<br />Recommend it highly, especially for a date night at home.
B008DYZKQE|5.0|This book just makes me laugh. My kids love it too nd I could read it over and over again.
B007X6SMD6|5.0|Good overview.. Great way to see how things work in AWS.  I am glad to get it when I did.
B009PNQUXO|2.0|Tried it. It didn't work. Deleted it. It only recorded maybe 30 seconds of the video then stopped. 30 seconds really.
B00006LIRI|4.0|While I thought the band's previous collection, The Best of 1980-1990, was pretty solid I couldn't help feeling that it was missing some key tracks. Fortunately, the band went further covering their 90's output and the result is a more solid collection, though a few pieces are still missing.<br /><br />Once again, the hits are all pretty much here, from \\"Mysterious Ways\\" and \\"One\\" to \\"Stay (Faraway, So Close!)\\" and \\"Beautiful Day\\". It's a bit puzzling why two songs from All That You Can't Leave Behind were included (\\"Beautiful Day\\" and \\"Stuck in a Moment You Can't Get Out Of\\"). That album is great and it came out in 2000, which means it technically fits in this timeline, yet these songs feel out of place. The band would have been better served saving those for another release and just focusing on the 90's exclusively. Additionally, the two new songs (\\"Electrical Storm\\" and \\"The Hands That Built America\\") are both great but since they came out in 2002 they also don't fit into the timeline. It's always thrilling to get new U2 songs but these feel out of place on a release that's supposed to cover a separate decade. Rarer inclusions like \\"Miss Sarajevo\\" and \\"Hold Me Thrill Me Kiss Me Kill Me\\" are definitely welcome and help make this collection meatier than its predecessor.<br /><br />I also want to bring up the four remixes on this album: \\"Gone\\", \\"Staring at the Sun\\", \\"Discotheque\\", and \\"Numb\\". For the most part, \\"Numb\\" and \\"Staring at the Sun\\" are both subtle remixes with differences that only hardcore fans will be able to hear. \\"Discotheque\\" sounds a bit gutted and lacks much of the bombastic energy of the original. \\"Gone\\" fares somewhat better, mostly because it sounds more like how they play it live, yet the original still edges it out (no pun intended). I know the band was disappointed with Pop (which I think was a brilliant record) but remixing these tracks just doesn't work. The originals were more than suitable.<br /><br />This is a great collection for those who want to delve deeper into U2's most experimental phase. There are some omissions that leave me scratching my head (where is The Fly and Lemon?) but overall it gets the job done and should satisfy any newcomer or fan willing to give it a spin.who want to delve deeper into U2's most experimental phase.

B004VFN7BE|4.0|It was good to watch this again after many years, solid movie.  Good acting by Sigourney and Helen, kind of predictable though.
B00000DFSK|4.0|There's no doubt that U2 is one of the greatest bands of all time and this collection is a great summation of their first decade of output. There's really nothing here to sway diehard fans, who most likely have these tracks already. This is geared more toward casual fans or those just looking for the group's most popular songs. In that regard it succeeds and all of the big hits are here: \\"New Year's Day\\", \\"With or Without You\\", \\"Sunday Bloody Sunday\\", \\"Desire\\", and \\"Pride (In the Name of Love)\\" are all present and more than welcome inclusions. However, the album itself only clocks in at 65 minutes and in that regard it feels a bit too brief, especially when a few more songs could have been included. The exclusion of \\"Gloria\\" is completely baffling to me and it's the one track that definitely should have been added on. \\"October\\" is featured as a hidden track and it's a pleasant surprise, though it's puzzling why nothing else from that album was added in. \\"Gloria\\" and \\"Tomorrow\\" would have been great additions.<br /><br />\\"Out of Control\\", \\"Two Hearts Beat as One\\", \\"The Electric Co.\\" and \\"Running to Stand Still\\" are all personal favorites that I wouldn't have minded making the cut either. This is a good collection of hits and a few fan favorites that make for a great introduction. It just would have been nice to see a few more tracks or rarities added onto the disc to take full advantage of the space available. Just don't let that stop you from digging into this band's stellar discography.
B004FP1WX0|4.0|Was not expecting where this movie went, this is creepy.  Very entertaining.  I would not have gone as far as these guys did.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I love this book so much! You won't regret reading it! It definately made me cry and you won't be able to put the book down until the very last page. :)
B00BVYLBP2|5.0|great story line about cloning experiments<br />Tatiana is great in multiple personnas<br />Science Fiction with intrigue and the corporate cover-up
B002Y0TGOU|1.0|I have used prime streaming before for tv shows without any problems, however, last night I tried to stream Star Trek and Amazon said my bandwith was too low to stream in HD so I stopped and used VUDU. It streamed in HD with no problems. Wasted $3.99!

1577314808|3.0|I do not take to his book as well as to others.  It is not quite what I need.  Too passive.  It ws recommended and when my trader friends recommend something we all buy it.  But this one, I have to admit I do not pick up to learn from.  It is now in the lirbrary and is not something I would have necessarily have bought, but it is just me, we are all different.
0061743526|5.0|I bought it for my daughter because she loves to read and I thought she should read another classic, but I will be &#34;borrowing&#34; this from her myself. Most people read this in highschool, but I don't remember so I will refresh my memory. Next stop the movie!
B008JGSM6G|4.0|Higher levels are challenging.  I am stuck on one that I know there is just no way yo do it.lol.  great fun
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Can't wait for season 4 to start.  Season 3 was just good as previous 2 seasons.  Highly recommend this series.
B000OZ0NXA|5.0|Excellent story, as is all of his Reacher stuff [I wonder if he ever wrote anything else?]<br />Holds my attention so that I sometimes sit up reading all night.
0937381888|5.0|i started brewing with a friend and he recommended palmer's book.  it's features a great narrative with how to brew and makes it approachable and fun.  i recommend it as a good launching point.
B00AZM7IQC|5.0|The 3D makes this a standout act. The acts are unique and beautiful. The costumes are just the best. Creativity at its best!
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I couldn't put it down. Now I'm starting the next one.  No breaks!!  It is as good as the first one. Maybe better
0061730335|3.0|In the second chapter of the book, Kamkwamba wrote that by reading till the end of his story you would be amazed on how much you didn't know about corn; which was used descriptively throughout the book in explaining political scenario in Malawi during the mid 1990 and change in agriculture policies. The last few chapters only begin to shed light on Kamkwamba and his life after TED. A worthwhile reading, though I believe it would have been more helpful if proper explanation and more illustration is given about his windmill.

B00BSWMITK|5.0|What can I say, Joe Satriani is in a league of his own. I have always been fascinated by his guitar skills and even saw him in concert at the House of Blues in San Diego a few years ago. He is a guitar master and I enjoy all of his music, it rock that takes you to a different place because it's instrumental. I like the new album like all of his other albums!!
0618871713|5.0|This graphic memoir changed my mind about graphic literature. It is a smart, thought provoking look at a fathers life and the effect is has on his daughter. More than a coming of age piece the illustrations give insight into the milieu that shaped the character of both father and daughter.
B0053O89WY|5.0|This is my favorite show and I could hardly wait to get this when I preordered it.  I don't watch it on TV; I just wait for the DVDs to come out and watch the episodes at once.  This is the best show out right now!

1742200508|4.0|Lonely Planet is now my new favorite brand of travel guide. I like their easy-to-read charts, colorful photos, rankings of\\"must-see\\" sites, and generally all the features they incorporate to make their guides so easy to use. Of course, like with any travel guide, there's no accounting for tastes, and something recommended highly might not suite everyone. But I have found after using several Lonely Planet guides that they tend to focus on making sure their information and advice is highly user-friendly and very practical. I like that they give various itineraries targeted to different budgets and that their descriptions are usually concise and to-the-point. This guide is super colorful and is bursting with practical info for the whole country, so it should be useful to tourists visiting any part of England. I got this copy after my first (and so-far only) trip to England (I'm American), but after checking it out myself I instantly loaned it to a friend who is heading across the pond for the first time this summer. I truly believe she'll find the guide helpful, and I plan to pick her brain about it when she gets back and add to this review if necessary. But after using several of them, I have come to the conclusion you can't go wrong with Lonely Planet guides.
B00BTHWFBK|4.0|music has really been sucking in the past few yearsthats why I was happy to this album.its a refreshing change.the only albums I have bothered to go out and buy are by bands who have been out for a long time.they are bob Dylan,the cure and ,yes,black Sabbath and ozzy.about once a year,a CD  comes out for me to buy.anyhow,this is the one for this year.<br />  first of all,black Sabbath put out a box set called \\"the black box\\" containing all of the studio albums by black Sabbath up until they kicked out ozzy.i thought that was awesome because after ozzy was gone they didn't matter anymore.black Sabbath began struggling as ozzy began putting out multi platinum albums.<br />  13 as compared to the other black Sabbath albums would rank somewhere in the middle I think.its behind \\"paranoid\\" and \\"sabatoge\\" which are my 2 favorites but way above \\"technical ecstacy\\" and \\"never say die\\" which are my bottom 2.so that leaves 6 more.they are all really good but ahead of 13.so out of 9 ozzy related black Sabbath albums,i'd rank it 7th.but,thats not bad because I think all of their albums ROCK !<br />  as far as personal performances go,the drums weren't as heavy which left out a big piece of the black Sabbath sound.this of course was because there was no burt ward but some other dude.the bass was cool but once again not as heavy as the old days.it was more over a soundscape before not it was there just more of an overtone.the vocals were good as always.however,ozzy sang as opposed to screamed.in metal,theres usualy a screaming,heavy singer involved.ozzy was awesome but not super.the real thing that made this album really cool was the guitar.tonni iommi rocked it out multiple times all over the album.and yes it was heavy ! so I wouldn't call this album \\"heavy metal \\" just \\"metal\\".<br />  if you are a black Sabbath fan then go buy it.i really think that any black Sabbath fan already did go buy it.<br />  OK, ive got to address one more thing.there is a song called \\"god is dead ?\\".itshould've been more appropriately called \\"is god dead ?\\".it IS NOT evil.ozzy just sings about a guy in a spiritual crisis.he DOES NOT  claim god is dead and even says  lines like \\"I don't believe that god is dead\\".i personaly don't know why a group of guys who have been trying to escape rumors of devil worship since the early 70's would put out a song like this.but I read the words and its not about what it sounds like.i would've left it off of the album entirely.its the only song I didn't like.<br />  so to recap,best album of 2013 so far,metal not heavy metal,great guitar and not evil.go buy it.
B00CATSONE|5.0|Book is great even though you're a genius or not it's good to read it a help you to commit to your dreams
B009MVM09W|5.0|If you're tired wait to watch this until you're not or you may feel sleepy but it isn't the movie's fault! This is classic Coen. So over the top at times you're not sure if this is a serious film or a comedy. Dark or Light  - it's BOTH of course! .. I love Tim and Jennifer does a fabulous job too.
0345529057|5.0|The product said \\"like new\\" and they pretty much came in brand new!!!  And they came in super fast! Thank you sooo much! When I'm done reading this set of books I'm definitely buying from you again!!!!!! :-D
B007SGLZP8|2.0|This story moved very quickly as most Grisham work does but was disappointing. The plot seemed to be all over the place and not well thought out. There was never an attempt to get to know the main character personally so you really cared whether he succeeded in his bid to stay out of jail and get back his life or not.<br /><br />Wouldn't recommend.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I am in anticipation for the next book! Could not put it down!  There is so much drama that everyone has created out of greed and jealously.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I think it is great.I see it is like temple run.  You should try it for free and then buy it.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I think this game is amazing especially when you beat your high score. I think it is funny  when the condor or the hawk mixed with a gorilla.
B00D6BU8GG|3.0|It was not as good as the others by far it was far fetched not Bruce Willis' best movie. I would not buy this movie even though I have all the previous movies
B00CH87HF4|4.0|A very immersive game with decent graphics and superb audio, I would recommend this game to anyone with a kindle fire. Could put in more cut scenes but still worth the money if you can afford to buy some of the weapons, armor, material etc.
B009NY43NY|5.0|I felt like this was the end, but I was waiting for Sookie to find true love and enjoyed this book.  Would have like a little more vamp though.
B008UCJ7KO|3.0|This book was just okay.  They get back together, but  nothing is really resolved.  What it reads like is that the author or maybe the author's publisher wanted another book, so instead of ending the book at this third book, they left a lot hanging so they could continue with the series.  The sex scenes were wonderful, but a book can't be wholly about sex, which this book basically was.
B00D6BN9NK|3.0|It just wasn't the best in this series of movies.....  Rent it, don't buy it....  I'm sure the next one will be better, they should have learned their lesson...
098357670X|5.0|This book is a must have for anyone who loves comedy (he's quite the comic writer as well as artist), caricatures and Mad Magazine.<br />Plus he shows you how he gets his results...  WOW WOW WOW
B00CWY76CC|4.0|A tried and tested format but entertaining non the less could be easier to move from screen to screen. But still a pleasant diversion
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I love the characters and events even with a few upsets it was a great book! I recommended all three too.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Surprisingly addictive, managed to waste a lot of time playing this game, can also be frustrating at times but enjoyable and a great deal of fun.
B00C7O8TSM|5.0|Love anything by the beach boys.  saw the reunion tour and it brings back memories every time I play it.
B00AH8FTT2|5.0|Another excellent story by this author - he writes in a way which engages & keeps your attention all the way through & the background to his stories is also very informative.
B002XHN776|5.0|My title says it all, the whole album has the perfect 30's sound.  Every song works perfectly in sequence with the next.
B008V2THJE|3.0|Really like J. Binoche but I just could not sit through this. Not only slow but confusing story lines. I know, I know, a foreign film. Someday I may try again.
B0099Y2YL6|5.0|Great show.  Season one was probably the best season, but this one had great moments as well.  If you liked the first two seasons, you'll like this one as well.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This is really fun. I miss having horses and I found this app and I think I'm gonna  get a horse
B005Q1W0ZQ|5.0|Great show.  Season one was probably better, this season seemed a little too soap opera-y.  But still lots of good stuff.  If you liked Season one you'll like this one as well.
B004A8ZWSS|5.0|The movie was a great suspenseful thriller that kept us wondering throughout.  I would highly recommend it to anyone.  Highly entertaining.
B008BU75IQ|4.0|I can't wait for the next &#34;installment&#34; of this epic.......  it's caused me to go back and re-read all his (Jeffrey Archer) previous books.....
0062082353|4.0|My comments are addressing the condition I received the book in. Nothing was broken or torn but quite a lot of pages had turned down corners and in one place it looks like a paper clip was used. I thought I was buying a new book but I believe I got someone else book. I will check closer the next time.
B008JJM88Q|2.0|ive seen people use this app and it looks fun but when I searched it it was 1.99 $ and it doesn't seem worth it.
B005CRQ4XI|3.0|I say this book was annoying because you just want to smack this girl for being so unprepared!  It's an okay read if you like true stories.  It was the choice for my book group, and everyone felt the same way about this read.  I would only say read it if you like this genre.  It's written fairly well, but sounds redundant.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|This was another great story of Gideon and Eva's affair! I am totally in love with this series...and this couple! So sexy and raw. I can't wait to see where the next book takes them....<br /><br />If you loved the first two books in this series, you will totally love this one as well. I think we all need a Gideon Cross in our lives!
B00CBKXGPI|3.0|This app is really fun, but short-lived, unless you're willing to pay  or the full game. Great idea... this is one of my favorite g5 games

B0051HNMTI|4.0|Good basic work for your core strength .Easy to follow along .I like that the instruction is simple and easy to understand .
B002MQYOFW|5.0|If you are looking for a good book to read this is it.  Everyone seemed amused with this series so I did not get a chance to check them out until recently.  I loved the first one, I am now on the 2nd one.  My daughter convinced me to read them and watch the movie which I did.  They do hook you in.
B004J4WNL2|4.0|I find this book informative  for introverts and also extroverts.  It's reassuring for introverts like myself to feel \\"normal\\" in a society that promotes an emphasis towards extroversion.
B002W1UEW4|5.0|I ordered this for my son and he loved it.  He said it was an awesome movie.  He is 14.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|Love this series...can only hope that it's not another five or six years until the next one. Come on George, we're dying here.
0345529057|5.0|Ordered the mass market print box set. Love the artwork on the box and on the books. Very nice set, well worth the $21 I paid for it. 3/4 of the way through book one and I am loving it just as much as the series.
B0068FYZIO|5.0|I watched this a year or so ago and taught a class called Contemporary Man - in this course we look at man's humanity and his in humanity.  After I saw this movie the first time I knew I needed to show it to my students.  This past semester was the last time this class was being taught so I decided I would show it.  I am not sure any movie hit home with my students like this one did.  Their reflected compositions demonstrated to me that they understood what the movie was about and how each of them needed to re-evaluate the way they treated their peers and all with whom they came into contact.  Many students sobbed while thanking me for having the courage to show this movie.  If you have never seen it you must watch and especially the extras - they interview the living members of Schindler's list - it was seeing them now and knowing the people they were in the movie and hearing the stories from their mouthes that really made the ultimate difference to my students.  Again ... a movie for the ages - it must never happen again!!!
B00A861QMM|3.0|its ok a little hard to get going but gets better. don't like having to give a review just to continue play
B00005NKK8|4.0|It really is a good soundtrack if you like this music ... I saw the movie and loved the music ... but somehow the music just does not sound as good on the CD as it did in the music
B002KJX4IE|5.0|i've been watching this movie since i was like 7 y old & i absolutely love michael keaton jajaja classic Beetle juice, Beetle juice , Beetle uh oh Juice :)
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I have yet to see the movie ... but the book was fantastic ... if you have not read it - you must - the ending was quite a surprise ... I thought something else was going on with the main character than what was going on ... must read!!!!
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|I don't know how but this game is so addicting and I love it. You should totally get this app because it's fun and challenging and they have  a lot of cool vehicles.
B004ASVS0E|5.0|Ms Lennox still has it ... what a great Christmas album ... saw her sing some of the songs on the Radio City Tree lighting show
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I tend buy books based on their cover art... needless to say I've read a lot of aweful books with beautiful covers... not this one.  Despite the fact that you know the sad truth about the protagonist from the get-go, it is a beautiful story of life and love, growing pains, and finding yourself.  I enjoyed reading every second of this book, even the parts I read through tears.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|Everyone knows by now, I think :)<br />It's hard to put down, and it makes you want to page forward to see when your favorite character comes up again.<br />I'm looking forward to reading the rest of the books in this series!
B00D6BN9NK|2.0|An obviously low budget...quick moneymaker for Bruce Willis.<br />The movie had no substance...and the action was just OK. In short,<br />don't bother!!!!
B0041CGP02|5.0|Is the real unique collection of the best song of bon Jovi. Also a great deal for the price I got the mp3 version of the cd. Great!
B00C4YZ12C|5.0|Smooth graphics, fast paced, easy handling. great game over-all.<br />The colors are really vibrant, the enemy ships are diverse and interesting.<br />Its not like shooting at the same enemy, they keep changing.
B00AYM6JFO|2.0|Not good Willioe Nelson songs - more like theme music for a rest home. Can I get a refund?? For Real
B00BP4Z8XY|4.0|Really enjoyed with the family.  Was really great to re-visit some of the older video games since I'm also old.
B0084IG8TM|5.0|I have read all 3 books - liked how they followed the story line, good graphics, etc. Can't wait for the next one.
B007GCY8FS|5.0|The book was everything you hoped a mystery would be! Well developed, interesting, and heart thumping. Could not put it down.
B0097HSS4M|5.0|I think that photo editor so awsome im making my own memes enhancing my photos it is great i love it
B005HSL626|2.0|I used to love this game until the most recent update. Now the game wont even load. It force closes every time I try opening it. Very frustrating!
B000JMKQX0|5.0|Loved the book. The idea and the way it was written is unique and fun. Seemed so realistic I thought for sure I'd have a quiz after each chapter like a history book. Only con was the vivid dreams it left me having lol.
B00CL68BK2|5.0|I was a bit overwhelmed at the beginning as the intense episodes of bipolar disorder played out.  However, as we got used to it, the tempo of the movie changed leading to a beautiful, and might I say hilarious, ending. Superb acting by both the main characters and Robert DeNero. Loved it!
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Good game. Fun and addictive. Great game for children and adults. Fun trying to get passed the levels and trying to get the coins
B00A0HQ7H8|5.0|Love this album. I actually bought it for my sister, but fell so in love with it that I couldn't part with it.
B004EPZ06Q|5.0|I love Hangover I have 1&2, and when 3 comes out I will buy it as well gotta have all 3.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|The characters really came to life in season 3, in my opinion. I made the mistake of reading some spoilers which I don't recommend. Definitely worth watching!
B004EPYZUS|3.0|It was a alright movie, a probably watch once then it sits for quite a while. I thought there were a lot of scenes in the movie, that absolutely WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE to pull off. I don't really care for fake looking action content.

B008I34ZFW|2.0|What if the Nazis built a base on the far side of the moon and evacuated some people there just before the end of World War II? And they were finally ready to come back and take over the Earth in 2018? And the first American astronaut captured by them was black? This premise is the sort of crazy comedy that appeals to me. At the end of our LoveFilm free month, I watched this movie on their streaming service.<br /><br />The movie starts well with many broad comic strokes. Astronauts are sent to the moon by the President of the United States (who looks and talks like Sarah Palin) in a bid to raise her profile and help her re-election. So naturally the black guy is a model, not an actual astronaut. He'll look good in political advertisements. The actual astronaut on the trip scans around for Helium-3, a mythic power source that the American government wants. He is killed almost immediately by the moon Nazis, whose base he has discovered. The Nazis grab the black astronaut (though they can't tell his skin color because of his helmet) and take him back for questioning. The guy who captured him is planning a coup so he can be the new fuehrer on the moon base. This wannabe Adolph also has a schoolteacher girlfriend who becomes involved in the plot. Hijinks ensue.<br /><br />The comedy works pretty well for the first half, mocking the shallowness of both the Nazis and the American president and even the United Nations. Exploring the moon base with its odd mixture of retro and futuristic technology (they still have gigantic, room sized computers in 2018!) and the silly Nazi culture (they have a ten-minute version of Charlie Chaplin's The Great Dictator which is edited down to make it look like Chaplin admires Hitler). Some of the Nazis eventually sneak to Earth to get more advanced technology (e.g. cell phones) to complete their fleet of flying saucers.<br /><br />The second half of the film runs out of steam. The Sarah Palin gags just repeat themselves and aren't funny anymore. The launch of the Nazi attack on the earth is pretty cool-looking but it peters out too. The movie becomes formulaic and uninspired, which is a shame since it showed so much promise in the beginning.<br /><br />If you want, you could watch half the movie. About the time they go see The Great Dictator on earth is when you can switch off. Nothing more to see here!
B00AEBB932|5.0|this was a great purchase and we were very pleased with the quality of the purchase..thank you very much for following up with this review..
B00ADIT8U2|4.0|This is a beautiful point and click adventure. The puzzles and scenes definitely deserve 5 stars. I gave the app 4 stars because even though the scenery is extensive it seemed needless because there were quite a few scenes with nothing useful to the game play. No items to be collected, no clues to read; so you spend a lot of time clicking away in these scenes with no results. It becomes frustrating. However, it is still a great game, 100% worth the money!
B00821P036|1.0|Like everything else Steven Spielberg touches, he's managed to take a decent idea and turn it into a melodramatic, over sentimentalized pile of goop. Characters keep making stupid, emotionally driven decisions that in the real world would have gotten the entire cast killed in the first episode.<br /><br />Terrible dialogue, bad acting, unbelievable script - the music score is simply unendurable...<br /><br />I'm a big sci-fi fan, and had great expectations for this series. I made it through five episodes hoping things would improve, but it just kept getting worse.<br /><br />This is \\"Days of Our Lives\\" with aliens.<br /><br />Horrible.
B00C5W3SBE|1.0|I am very disappointed that this movie is not sold in a blue ray 3D and blue ray combo package. I was prepared to purchase a package, but now I won't purchase either the 3D or Blue Ray alone.  In today's economy, that is a lot of money for a family to spend on a movie.  I guess if this becomes a trend, my movie library will not be growing.  Netflix and video store here I come.

B00DBSZJRM|5.0|I just watched Hansel and Gretel and I thought it was a great movie. Fast paced, humorous, and entertaining. This isn't Citizen Kane and if that's what your looking for look someplace else. If you want to be entertained with fast paced action and well defined good guy/bad guy roles this is the movie for you. It is semi-gory but you really should be expecting that. All in all I recommend this movie for people who want an entertaining movie that doesn't take it's self too seriously.
B00AK57N00|2.0|Was a free download, so I decided to give it a try. It's basically just the same thing over and over again. Swing on a rope, decide when to let go, and try to land on the landing pad.<br /><br />it just wasn't that imaginative.

B002WV5A9G|3.0|This movie is an entertaining spectacle, but it omits so many things that made Star Trek so attractive (it doesn't think big enough), and the plot is pretty ramshackle.
B0026Q8EWW|5.0|I COULD NOT BELIEVE HOW THE INSURANCE INDUSTRY WAS SHOWN, IF YOU THINK OTHERWISE, THINK AGAIN. MOST PEOPLE ARE ASSUMING THEY ARE GETTING A FAIR DEAL IF THEY ARE OFFERED A SETTLEMENT, THAT HAPPENS ONLY,ONLY IF THEY HAVE NO WAY OTHER THAN TO MAKE AN OFFER. THE OFFER WILL BE SMALL. IF THEY CAN HIRE A VERY EXPERIENCED, COMPETENT DEFENSE ATTORNEY, NO OFFER WILL BE MADE. SOMETIMES A SMALL OFFER, WHICH IF NOT ACCEPTED WILL RESULT IN THE PAYMENT OF COSTS AND THEIR ATTORNEY'S FEES IF THEY CAN WEASEL OUT A WIN. A LITTLE UNREALISTIC IN SOME WAYS, BUT THE VERY WELTHY INSURANCE INDUSTRY AGAINST YOU, EVEN IF YOU ARE RIGHT, IS NOT A FAIR CONTEST.

B00C7JGDBW|5.0|\\"Oz the Great and Powerful\\" is a fun, endearing and entertaining movie! This amazing production is beautiful to look at with colorful, gorgeous images of Oz, has good acting and some of the best computer animated characters (China Girl and the Monkey) ever created! I have seen this entertaining movie 3 times, it has been here playing here in Albuquerque in one of our biggest theatres for almost 4 months! This movie has a somewhat slow and old-fashioned sense about it, it is not all explosions and quick edits. I thought the casting was great and James Franco does an admirable job portraying a side show magician who wants more out of life and dreams big, he \\"finds himself\\" saving the awesome citizens of Oz. Michelle Williams is wonderful as always. Mila Kunis deserves much credit for a hard role being the \\"bad witch\\".  THIS FUN MOVIE IS ENTERTAINING AND ENDEARING.You'll enjoy this production if you liked the 1939 Wizard of Oz classic, don't compare the two - this is a creative adaption and a different time, a \\"prequel\\" perhaps. But like the '39 movie, it has great visuals and a sweet story. I am a true Wizard of Oz fan and liked this film very much.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I am a latecomer to Downton. Purchased season one and watched it all on a rainy Saturday. Ordered Season Two. Couldn't wait for a rainy day. Marvelous character development and plot lines. The addition of new characters does not distract and merges easily into the ongoing saga. Moving from one episode to the next is not laden with any ads or promos. It's all Downton. Excellent.
B002RI9MZC|5.0|Some say you can judge a successful book by the physical emotions it evokes. This book sometimes had me laughing so hard my stomach hurt, at other times I had to stop as I couldn't read through my tears. It's a beautiful and powerful story following one man's life, after finishing it I felt like I had lost a friend.... It's a long read but I recommend it to anyone, you won't regret it.
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|I began reading this trilogy while waiting on the final installment of 50SOG last summer. While I'll admit that Ms Day has a much better grasp on prose and character development, I was very surprised by the last 2 installments. Bared to you was by far the best of this series. I was disappoint in Reflected In You and vowed only read Entwined so that I could see how all of the loose ends got tied up. So imagine my surprise when I received the the kindle edition and read it in 2 days only to find that this was truly not the end. Of course I figured this out 1/4 into reading this book(Entwined). I am sad to say that this story went from intriguing to predictable quickly. I will not rant about the delayed release, things happen. But to market a series as a trilogy then change the tide mid-stream for no apparent reason is unacceptable. Especially when within the pages of the latest edition the only thing the writer managed was to add silly side stories about characters that few cared about.<br /><br />If you really felt to need to extend the series do it as an off shoot separately. I am sure that most of the readers of the Crossfire series would have bitten on a secondary series with some or all of the original characters. But to extended with no real reason feels like a ploy to gain additional royalties.<br /><br />The additional time taken to release the book should have been to ensure the story was wrapped up tight and breadcrumbs left for the off shoot series. Leaving the series with a cliff hanger was tasteless and unimaginative.<br />This series isn't a movie yet. Avid readers have great imaginations and every minute we are left waiting for a conclusion leaves us the time to imagine our own ending which at this point might be better.<br /><br />I am sad to say that I will not wait with baited breath for the next installment(s). Best of luck Eva,Gideon, and Cary, I hope your story ends well.

B00BTHWFBK|3.0|You all know the story about \\"Sabbath is going to make an album like their first one \\". And now it's here, a modern sounding record ! Except for the stripped-down sound, there is little to compare to the first record. I find no medieval magic & mystery, the songs are a bit predictable, and because Rick Rubin doesn't like reverb there's no depth for a gloomy musical landscape. As a musician I like to analyse the music I listen to. Tony's guitar sound on this record has lost a lot of its heaviness(his guitar isn't down-tuned, but on the first 2 albums it wasn't either and it sounded very heavy though!). In the old days Tony used to create great dynamics going from power chords to single notes (during the sung parts)in the same riff as you can hear in Iron Man, Black Sabbath, ...No extended soloing on this album either and certainly no multiple layers of guitars. On the first albums Tony liked to entwine several solos which became part of the trademark Sabbath sound. Geezer's bass sound is new too. No more melodic lines or fancy stuff here, just straightforward agressive bass playing. Geezer used to be a guitarist and up to now this always showed in his melodic basslines. Then for the drummer, I think he's ok (you can't replace Bill - he's unique) but it's a pity that he didn't insist on having another bass drum sound. I suppose he wasn't in the position to tell Rubin to get lost with his Metallica-like bass drums,haha. So for me it's still Master Of Reality or Sabotage; that's what Sabbath should sound like. I've got the feeling that this is Rubin's album more than Black Sabbath's. But looking at the other reviews I see that most people are incredible happy with the new album, and of course it's a good thing that the boys got back together again to show the world what they're still capable of. I especially like \\"Dear Father\\" and the bonus song \\"Pariah\\". I know that some day a re-mixed, remastered version of this CD will appear and maybe it'll be more to my taste ...
1584282584|5.0|I don't usually write review, but this time, its different. If you want your photography to stand out, you need to read this book. Amateur or pro, new to flash or not.<br /><br />To describe myself, I would say that I'm an ''high end'' amateur photographer mainly intersted in portrait/wedding. I'm a big fan of natural light, however, to filfull my needs and be ready for any situation, I purchased a speedligh and this book at the same time about two years ago. Even tough I was new to flash photography, I was able to become rapidly suprisingly good at understanding the light created by the flash, thanks to this book. Even now, I'm still using it as a reference book that I read once in a while to keep me doing the small things that I sometimes forgot and that really make the difference. I would say that A LOT of professionnal photographers would benefit from the content of this book. I've worked for some professionnal photographers as an assistant and I always keep an eye on the photographer when I'm invited to wedding or other events and I'm shocked to see how they don't follow the basic rules of on camera flash photography I've learned in this book. Using on camera flash properly should NEVER result in flat, boring light.<br /><br />I was amazed by the detailed information included in this book, especially in the technical aspect of flash (sync speed, first/rear curtain, balancing ambiant light with flash, ...). The way that the author describes these technical aspect made it simple to understand. The second portion of this book is about exemples he gives and the progression towards getting the shot he has in mind by modifying the way the flash is bounced of different surfaces, the camera settings, etc. These step by step examples really helped me understant the do's and don't of on camera flash photography.<br /><br />To describe a little bit more the content of this book, I would say that it is only about on camera flash (as said in the title) in situation where you need to work ''quickly'' like wedding or on location portrait shoot (these techniques could also be used in other situations when you just don't want to transport and install a full studio setup). The author is consious that this situation won't create a light that could be compared to using multiple studio strobes but he definitely get the most he can out of a single flash, mounted on camera. More specifically, the author tells us about choosing the right surface to bounce flash off (for exemple, the distance between the surface where flash is bounced and the model: if there's many people in the shot, the distance should be about the same in order to light equally each of them), the different light modifier and there use (using the classic omnibouce -white cap that diffuse light- is very rarely a good option because it throws to much light foward, resulting in flat lighting), how to balance color temperature when combining ambient light and flash, etc.<br /><br />Hope it helps !

B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Well I've finally finished Entwined With You. I read the first two books in 24hrs each and they left me wanting more,so this time I took my time and savored the continuing story of Gideon and Eva.<br /><br />Once again Miss Day has left us hanging and wanting to learn, feel, worry and cheer for the relationship between Gideon and Eva.<br /><br />Thank god they are both strong characters and the compelling mix of people that interact in their lives also leave us concerned and anxious for a happily ever after to their saga.<br /><br />So many female readers relate to the protagonists of this epic modern story. We all wish well for them and secretly want a man like Gideon in our own lives, even though I don't think many of us would know how to handle this totally sexy hunk, we can root for Eva and not feel the least bit jealous. She knows how to handle him.<br /><br />Can hardly wait for the next installment. It's okay Miss Day if it takes a couple of months. I need time to rest, dry off and get my feet back on the ground to continue my boring mundane life.<br /><br />Sylvia Day is a wonderful writer and her stories are extremely easy to read and loose yourself in her wonderfully developed stories. She is relatable and a FIVE STAR in my estimation.

B00D6BN9NK|1.0|Ive loved pretty much all the Die Hard movies. The original I saw in the theaters years and years ago and was blown away by it! Hands down one of the top 5 action movies of all time. Bruce Willis was amazing in it. Funny and bad ass all at the same time. Die Hard 2 I liked at the time. I was young and impressionable but in the series of Die Hard films not very strong. I think it wasn't so great was there were too many bad guys and not a really centralized one and the supporting cast was so-so. Die Hard with a Vengeance and Live Free or Die Hard were both really good. Sam Jackson and Bruce Willis were very good counterparts. It got a little \\"yelly\\" at times, in fact most of the dialogue was yelled but the plot was decent, they didn't use much GCI and overall was 2nd in my most favorite Die Hard films. Live free or die hard was good because of Justin Long. Most people kind of pan him as an actor but he was very believable as a techie and he was also a great counterpart to Bruce Willis. Timothy Olyphant played a surprising good bad guy. His dry sense of humor and scow ell made me feel at least that getting on his bad side wasnt a great idea. He did die in a creative way that I even wince a little bit when I have seen this movie on cable.<br /><br />This latest Die Hard doesnt even belong in the pantheon of Die Hard movies. Bruce Willis looks tired and bored in this movie. It kind of has a plot but not really. You can see the action before it happens and want to yell at the actors to move but as we all know that's pretty pointless. Apparently John McClaine and his son John McClaine in this one are made of Teflon and are scratch proof. Remember in the original when he cuts his feet on the glass and he has to pull the glass out and wrap his feet in paper towels and they really made the audience feel it? In this one they are jumping out of building, through windows and other crap and barely a scratch on them. I also never really believed the bad guys were going to get awaywith their ruse like I did in the other Die Hards. Suspension of disbelief doesnt even qualify here it's so bad. Overall this isn't even worth watching and I hope you heed my warning by re-watching some of the old ones or watch Schwarzenegger in The Last Stand. It's surprisingly good!

B00CW665VI|5.0|I just finished this book and found it extremely well written with excellent Character development and an interesting narrative from the central male character Drew. I found this book to be entertaining, witty, intellectual and flourishing with vivid imagery. I stumbled on it without reading any reviews or research and was pleasantly surprised by its extraordinary quality and richness. For a glimpse inside what makes men really tick, this book offers some good illustrations. I also appreciated the dynamic, brilliant successful, driven and outspoken Kate along with the empowerment of all the women in this book. It was a fun healthy good hearted read that was both sensual and impossible to put down.

B00CH87HF4|4.0|I put off rating this game, despite its' insistence that I take time to write a review right away.  I'm glad I waited, as my opinion has changed over time.<br /><br />First, I have to agree with most people that this is a very addictive RPG. The graphics are much better than I'd expected from a game written for a tablet. I have seen a tiny bit of CPU lag with large mobs as I've gotten into more difficult levels, but never so bad as to really detract from the gaming experience. As others have noted, it's not a small app...weighing in at just under 1GB.<br /><br />I have to disagree a bit with those who assert that the leveling system is smooth.  The only way to move past certain levels is either by extensive grinding through the same content for days at a time, or by spending real money on high enough level gear to survive harder areas.  The only way to modify your gear otherwise is to combine low level &quot;charms&quot; into higher level &quot;charms,&quot; giving you improvements to your health and damage.  However, even creating meaningful charms requires spending real money to expand your bag space, as these gem-like charms gather up like locusts in a field by the time you make your first 10 levels.  I found that I had easily spent $35 to buy a decent set of armor, an ok weapon, and 30 additional slots for my inventory.  This combination affords me enough variety to prevent the repetitive grinding from getting terribly boring, as I gain gold to pay for the 2 or 3 upgrades one can buy without spending real money...and paying to 'merge' my bagfull of lesser charms into charms strong enough to keep me alive through the next higher level.<br /><br />The other benefit to grinding through the same dungeons over and over is the farming of ore.  Most dungeons give up black iron ore, with a couple higher actually doing dragonite.  There are 4 ore types: black iron being the lowest  and voidstone being the highest.  3 of any lower ore can be transmuted into 1 piece of thenext higher type.  Hence, 3 black iron transmutes into 1 dragonite; 3 dragonite becomes 1 ancient Crystal, etc.  These ore can be used to make some very nice gear.  If you spend your real money well, you won't have any use for black iron gear, and probably not dragonite either.  So, you're looking at 9 black iron ore to make 1 ancient crystal.  Since each piece of armor requires around a dozen of whatever ore type, you will be grinding a lot!  Oh, yeah...your new weapon costs 30 ore, so plan on the killing the same stuff for quite a while...<br /><br />So, those are a few details I thought of importance to getting into this game.  It may sound a little daunting at first...and it is a bit trying at times.  However, the game is challenging, fun to play and easy to get caught up in.  If you just want a quick run through a fast-paced, fun dungeon or two, and don't want to spend a fortune buying new gear every 6 levels or so, Dungeon Hunter 4 is perfect for you.  If you are like me and want to rush through each level to see what comes next, the game is either going to get expensive, or really repetitive....or some combination of both.  The bottom line is that your gaming style will define the experience you have.  Regardless though, it's fair to say you will have a fair amount of fun!

0446343129|5.0|Over the past few years I have done everything that I could to make my family healthy. We watch what we eat, we exercise, and we do everything that the doctor and the medical establishment tells us to do. But it wasn't working. No matter how much I counted calories, worked out, and obsessed about food, I could not stop gaining weight. Two years ago I stopped drinking soda cold-turkey and within two weeks I lost 14lbs. The longer that I was off of soda the less I wanted it, and when I allowed myself to &#34;cheat&#34; and have one, it tasted terrible, it tasted like chemicals. I couldn't believe that I had been drinking that since I was a teenager. BUT the more that I didn't drink soda, the more it seemed that I craved chocolate. I thought it was ok, I was losing weight, to allow myself some chocolate, but the more I had, the more I wanted. Now, thanks to this book, I understand why. Sugar is a danger. NOT bad for us, but a real danger. It's terrifying, and you can read this and go on to do your own research on what he says, I always do more research before I really believe.

B0068THAGY|1.0|The movie seemed decent in the beginning it becomes very predicable within minutes. They could have spent a few minutes on plot development.
B007ZXK08C|4.0|Gillian Flynn's book is a different take on romance, mystery, crime, while incorporating all of those elements. A good, absorbing read.
B00C7DGRL4|4.0|Hansel & Gretel are bounty hunters who track and kill witches all over the world. As the fabled Blood Moon approaches, the siblings encounter a new form of evil that might hold a secret to their past.<br /><br />This movie is an interesting take on the fairy tale with a twist.  Although this isn't a fairy tale for kids as there is a lot of blood, violence and killing but for adult this is an entertaining film.  The movie has lots of action and a decent storyline although fairly predictable.  Even still this movie is a worthwhile watch.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|does everything I need it to do and then some. I highly recommend it for everyday use. it breaks down the setup for battery life in easy to read settings.
B009CPE424|5.0|I hope that they continue making these movies. Nice clean fun. I rented this one twice! Great for kids and grandmas too.
B002ISID10|4.0|-Incredible screams<br />-Great melodic breakdowns<br />-Incredible emotion<br /><br />Curious to see how the next album is..<br /><br />You can tell this band does their own thing/has their own style and doesn't conform.  That's what makes them great.<br /><br />Cons: album is a little too short, some of the songs sound similar
B00BVYNSLC|5.0|The leading actress is insanely talented!  She is able to morph in and out of characters with such ease, you believe each persona presented.  I can't wait until Spring 2014 for the new season!

B003VANOFY|5.0|This has everything you need, comfort, sound quality, wireless, lasts up to 10 hours which is brilliant, It would've been nice to have 4-5 G keys. The volume roller is really useful, and love how the mic mutes when you put it up. I just love it !
B00821PCJS|3.0|After a while it is starting to wear a bit thin and the characters are just a bit either to good or bad and not so believable.
B001YYQ9SS|5.0|the bones scenes really flushed out the story more and it looks more realistic. I like the fact they put in more of denzels back story two.
B0082Z1CVQ|4.0|Although the action is somewhat slow, the plot makes up for it. I especially enjoyed the fact that there is a resolution to all the major issues.
B0043JDUNS|4.0|Good movie. Liked it better than the first. Lots of action. Don't have anything else to say about it. It's a good movie.
0525953728|3.0|Being ex-military (with security clearance), I felt let-down against the background of the contoversies generated in the public realm. What sticks out is undoubtedly the potential for embarrsement for senior ranking officers as it relates to mistakes made and actions not taken. If anyone has every read, for example, Blind Man's Bluff, or 15-Minutes, those gave away some &#34;secrets&#34; albeit now declassified.

B005LAIIQC|5.0|#4 is the best of the four. A lot more intrigue and suspense. Difficult to foresee what's coming next. The director does love car chases.

B005S9ELVC|4.0|Note: May contain spoilers. Proceed with caution.<br /><br />It's 1949 and Mickey Cohen (Sean Penn) is running Los Angles. A man who defines the term \\"crime boss\\" as he's not only the top cheese in the criminal underworld, but he also has both the police and judiciary on his payroll. In an attempt to bring Cohen to justice, Bill Parker (Nick Nolte) hand picks war veteran Sgt. John O'mara (Josh Brolin) to start an operation to do whatever he feels necessary to take this man down. With the help of his wife Connie (Mireille Enos), John rounds up a group of five guys to assist him.<br /><br />Sgt. Jerry Wooters (Ryan Gosling), Office Coleman Harris (Anthony Mackie), Officer Conway Keeler (Giovanni Rivisi), Officer Navidad Ramirez (Michael Pena), and Officer Max Kennard (Robert Patrick). These are the five men John chooses. Each with different personalities and a different set of skills. Jerry is your run-of-the-mill pretty boy who falls for Cohen's lover Grace Faraday (Emma Stone), Coleman is a good shooter who's skilled with knives, Conway is the brains, Max is a quick shot who's almost always dead-on, and Navidad is a young officer who looks up to Max. A diverse group of men which allows for some interesting banter between the six of them.<br /><br />As a whole I thought the story was solid. When you go into films that are based off of a true story there's always going to be changes and fabrications so don't expect a perfect depiction of what went down. Also, because it's a gangster film things can get somewhat repetitive about halfway through, but that's to be expected. With that said, Gangster Squad is able to keep your attention because of the characters you're presented with. It may not always do a great job of fleshing out these characters (Grace & Navidad are the best examples here), but I found myself feeling for Jerry and even Conway, to some extent. Plus, even with the underdeveloped characters it's easy to fall in love with all of them due to their chemistryon screen.<br /><br />Surprise surprise, Gangster Squad is filled with violence, a lot of it. Apparently this was an issue with the big reviewers, but I'm not sure what they were expecting. Either way, if you or the company you chose to watch this with aren't a fan of really violent movies then I would recommend skipping this at all cost. From start to finish the violence is non-stop as you go from firefights to fist fights to stabbings. Then you rinse and repeat. This is definitely a hard \\"R\\" in terms of violence, but, as I said, it's kind of expected. It's a movie about a group of cops trying to take down a notorious gangster. If you're looking for rainbows and unicorns you're looking at the wrong movie.<br /><br />If watching movies is a hobby of yours then expect to recognize a few familiar faces. Chances are you've seen all six of these cops in something prior to this and Emma Stone and Sean Penn aren't strangers to the big screen either. With that said, just like the story, the performances in Gangster Squad are solid. No one really stood out or took my breath away, but at the same time no one really bombed either. The entire cast was able to give enjoyable performances that managed to keep my attention the entire way through. Even though the story follows these six cops, a lot of focus is put on John and Mickey. So most of the dialogue is coming from either Josh Brolin or Sean Penn. Thankfully both of them are able to hold their own and carry the movie for its two hour running time.<br /><br />Finally, the score, provided by Steve Jablonsky, is kind of a mixed bag. At times I really loved it because it felt perfect during the scene I was currently watching, but then there were other times where it just felt so out of place. It's almost as if the intensity level of the scene wasn't matching the intensity level of the composition. Of course, intense pieces are necessary in all films, but they have to feel right for their corresponding scenes. When the music issomehow distracting you from what you're watching it's no longer serving its purpose, it's just taking you out of the experience. Sadly, I found this to be a common occurrence while watching this film and it kind of hampered my enjoyment a bit.<br /><br />Overall Score: 7/10 - The problem with Gangster Squad is that, at times, it seems to take itself a bit too seriously. Some of my favorite moments from the movie were when the six officers were just joking around and enjoying each others company. Now I know that would make for a boring film if that's all that we were given, but it seems to lack a consistent flow. Also, the casting was fantastic, but by the end of it I felt like I still didn't know who most of these characters were. You had a group of extremely talented performers, but none of their characters really got fleshed out. While Gangster Squad may not be one of the best films ever made, it's enjoyable enough to warrant a viewing. So if you were eyeing it in theaters then I would suggest giving it a rental.
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|The ending. What!? I know everyone keeps complaining about it, but it's true. The ending is so abrubt. You can tell the author wasn't done writing the book, but wanted to get it out. The deadline kept moving, and when this one came up, you can tell it was just pushed out instead of finished. None of the drama, or mysteries were solved in this book like the previous two. I don't know if the author even knows what the conclusion will be! I still enjoy the series but this book kept adding new questions, without answering any. I will continue to read the story but I can see where people are frustrated and giving up on Crossfire.
B0031Q0XCA|1.0|The previews that were on the disc, and seen before the movie, should have been a warning. They were silly and juvenile and something that most adults would dismiss almost immediately. That unfortunately set the tone for the movie that wasn't far above it story-wise. I suppose they, and this film, would appeal to young girls, more than a mature audience. Unfortunately that audience would be limited as there is some fairly explicit sexual language in it.  I kept waiting for the film to have some substance but it never did. Much of it was predictable and poorly written. His friends behavior and acting often seemed artificial and corny. For me this was a total waste of money and time. I actually fell asleep the last ten minutes of the movie and didn't bother to replay the ending to see how it ended. Now I need to find someone to give it to.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Pinterest has opened a new world of people sharing their interests and loves. It is a part of my day.
B008BU75IQ|5.0|I couldn't believe that the book ended when it did. I love the Clifton chronicles and can't wait for the next one.
B006MW3V6U|1.0|I saw the first season on Netfix. I did not purchase this session. I will wait untill I can see it on Netflix
B009RH9FR6|5.0|This case is wonderful!! It stands on the table for my three year old to watch her shows an it stands vertical so I can read or type. It also looks sharp and professional but it's durable to for those occasional drops too. Best case for the kindle hands down!

B0073XORCY|1.0|I've been a Jethro Tull fan since the early 70s and have been to many of the concerts over the years, so I was excited to get this album. I forced myself to listen to it a few times and the last time, I couldn't get through the entire thing. To me, the music seemed dreary and the lyrics and subject matter completely uninspired. The songs reminded me of first draft freshman composition essays written at the 11th hour. The overriding theme seemed to be, &#34;I started with so much potential but then I got molested at boarding school, and then I sold my soul to make lots of money, and now I wish I had done more with my life. Poor, poor, pitiful me.&#34; Not only has that story been done to death, but in this case, it's not even told in an interesting or imaginative way.<br /><br />The music lacks the edge I've always associated with Tull's works.  It drones on blandly blending from one song to the next. I've always found Tull's music gets my mind going, especially creatively. This album leaves me feeling frustrated and wanting to smash something.<br /><br />Maybe I'm just missing the talent level of the album. If you like it, that's great. But I do not like any of it and it does not sound like a Jethro Tull album to me, not even one of Anderson's solo album.
B00BHNR1KQ|4.0|Good setting and a lack of special effects which I cannot stand in &#34;creepy&#34; movies nowadays. The plot-line was semi-weak, but the imagery and small scares here and there made up for it.
B00CDSVZHY|5.0|Best movie I've seen in a decade. A definite must-watch. Dr. steals the show! Fox does a great job too.

B00BTHWFHE|4.0|Since its announcement in 2011, the Black Sabbath reunion has been plagued with bad luck. From Tony Iommi's cancer diagnosis to Bill Ward's departure, it seemed as if things couldn't get any worse. Luckily, the same cannot be said for Sabbath's new album: it's very good. 13 is the first Black Sabbath studio album since 1995's Forbidden. While Ward isn't on this album, 13 is still Sabbath's first album with Ozzy Osbourne since 1978's Never Say Die. With Rick Rubin producing, 13 is a natural sounding Black Sabbath album.<br /><br /> Sabbath waste no time and open the album with \\"End of the Beginning\\", a very doom riddled track with Tony Iommi and Geezer Butler playing away. Drumming for the album is Rage Against the Machine drummer Brad Wilk, who does a very good job throughout the album. The song almost follows the same structure as the self-titled track off of Sabbath's self-titled debut album, with it being heavy and then getting softer when Osbourne starts to sing. Things get more exciting when the song picks up speed, in which Iommi pulls of yet another amazing guitar solo.<br /><br /> The lead single, \\"God Is Dead?\\", has the potential to be a future Sabbath classic. The bass work from Butler is superb and the song is well written. The lyrics, partially based off German philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche, are just excellent: \\"The blood runs free/the rain turns red\\" sings Osbourne. \\"Give me the wine/you keep the bread\\". It's also the longest song off the album, clocking in at nearly nine minutes. So this give the band time to jump into a jazz/swing part of the song, which is reminiscent of \\"Electric Funeral\\" and \\"Hole in the Sky\\".<br /><br /> \\"Loner\\" is a very interesting track: it sounds like two Sabbaths at once. The heavy riff coming from Iommi sounds like something he would've written in the Ronnie James Dio era. When Osbourne starts to sing, it starts to sound like an Osbourne solo track. Still, \\"Loner\\" is a great song: the lyrics are fairly simple and the aforementioned Iommi riff makes this a highlight. \\"Zeitgeist\\" could quite possibly be the offspring of \\"Planet Caravan\\" while \\"Age of Reason\\" sounds like something off of Sabotage, given the choir in the background.<br /><br /> \\"Damaged Soul\\" could quite possibly be the bluesiest song that Sabbath have ever done. Sure, most of their debut album was filled with jazz and blues influenced but to hear them go back to this is something. Hell, even Osbourne plays the harmonica on this one. The album chugs out with the heavy \\"Dear Father\\". The band even pays homage to the debut album by closing the track with the ringing bells that began the debut album.<br /><br /> 13 is an impressive album. It's just great to hear Black Sabbath again with an album that fits perfectly with the other eighteen Sabbath studio albums. Fans who hold the eight Osbourne-era albums close to heart now have a long-awaited ninth entry that they can always come to again and again
B00C1BUYX4|4.0|Very good movie.  A little slow at times, but probably just me.  Very well done and well cast.  Definately would recommend!
0425269205|4.0|Ok- so it wasn't as exciting as I would have liked, but it was by no means disappointing! Sookie deserved to have true love and the only person that truly loved her was Sam- and he loved her through everything. I thought it was well written to wrap up each character's life. All of these books are readable over and over which is what I'm doing now! The books are so much better than the obnoxious series that is for sure. Thanks Charlaine for giving us Sookie!
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I love the app.  It allows me to read all of my Kindle books on my Android tablet with ease.  And it easily syncs up with my pc.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Really poorly written.  Very amateurish.  If you are just after the 'titillation factor', I guess it's certainly there, but I couldn't get past the poor writing.
B00BUAEYVK|1.0|Bad story, people you don't know, the thing you love about all the die hard series is they have great villains (guys you love to hate). this wasn't the case.<br />Over all I seen it at the movies and it was a waste of time and money. You must see it before you buy it. You might like it then you can buy it. I will wait for Netflix before I see another.
B000O8OTNC|4.0|Works as intended , easy to store and gives a nice sharp edge.  The price is just right.  This is a quick fix, anyone who enjoys sharpening blades won't enjoy this method.  You know who you are.
B0091REZMW|4.0|typical search game but seems to be fun thus far. hoping that load time between levels stays as quick as it is now.
B00CWM3F4C|4.0|I like it, I am knocking off 1 Starr for Mike but not for Layne because too many stars have already been taken off for him over the last two albums. I have liked these guys since way back when they used to come through town playing glam rock, and loved them since facelift came out. They are missing some key members of what was Alice in Chains and that's a shame and its not the same, OK that's out of the way. I am a fan of Jerry solo. glad hes still making music with the other guys here and it sounds pretty good to me. Really I am not taking off any stars for anybody being dead, just giving it a review as a new album. Also I am reviewing the music and not the sound quality as some of the reviews and as I said as far as the songs go I like them. I am taking off 1 star because I am going to agree with a couple of people about the new guy. I think he sings pretty good...but...I do get a feeling that he may be trying too hard to sound like Layne and not himself and that it comes off a little flat. Maybe its imagination or just that Layne really came out in the songs kinda like Mike on bass except another Mike took his place with a lot of grace and that what I am waiting for William Duvall to do is really start wailing in a way that is his own and really take ownership of being the lead singer of Alice in Chains. Sorry William if this is just how you sing...it is good and it goes along with the wonderful Alice in Chains sound but I keep waiting for you to break out of the constant chorus and make your big move. I was crushed when Bon Scott died and then Brian Johnson came in and did his own thing and back in black is one of my favorite albums...LET LOOSE MAN !<br />Anyway enough of my babble as I said...I LIKE IT !
B002G1K82Q|5.0|We had this DVR'd for well over a year and watched it repeatedly.  Even though an enormous time during the movie, the characters are &#34;high&#34;, the music and the story are amazing.
B00C32R64G|5.0|It is so hard to write this review without using profanities. I was totally on another wavelength in my music listening when I realized that Volbeats new album came out (do I age myself when I say album ? ) and now I have to listen to them all day, maybe for the next few weeks. When their first album came out to me it was love at first listen and every album since has been the same. They are one of my favorite bands and I think they have been able to keep the same fantastic sound with every album even though they have been through different lead guitar players over the years. This is both splendid and groovy at the same time, thanks again Volbeat. If you have not listened to these guys its like Sha Na Na and Slayer did the wild thing and this is their funked up birthchild.
0345803485|1.0|This was by far the poorest excuse for a book that I've ever read!!  The characters were just completely unbelievable!!  I hate that I wasted my time reading this mess!!!  UGH!!!

B006MW3V6U|5.0|I had heard of this show for a while, but by the time I found it, the season was over! I bought this season to watch on my Kindle on a long trip. It was great and I had to force myself to not watch it while on vacation and save the last episodes for the trip home!
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|This was a great book along with the crossover books I really h hope there is a mother book in this series.  MUST READ....

B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is addictive. Starting playing to help my daughter collect coins and upgrades and now I find myself playing the game for my own personal satisfaction.
B00AA0TJO8|5.0|It's sooooo cool when you become a part of the game! Drawing what you need is such an excellent idea! Only thing I'd change is having the ability to save after a particularity difficult spot. It's cute that you can play w/ other non-essential bits as well! Please keep these coming and THANKYOU!
B00CHSPB8Y|2.0|It never felt like I had full control of the character even when I switched the control settings from gyro to hand swipe. Then it crashed once and then it crashed a second time freezing up my kindle so I deleted it.
B00AQM8H9I|1.0|I, personally, did not care for this game at all as I like games that move fast.  I uninstalled after two game plays.
B004LWZWGK|3.0|What can I say about The Dark Knight Rises other than it had a tough act to follow after The Dark Knight. I personally did not like the inclusion of a Robin character. It felt like they just threw that in so that the studio could continue the franchise if they want to. The story did not flow all that well for me either and the no autopilot thing was so obvious that it was laughable. One question that plagues me even now is how the hell does Bane eat anything??
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|I couldn't put this book down. I never expected the turns this story took out of the series. Eva and Gideon are so good together in a dysfunctional sort of way and I cannot wait to see what happens next!
B007J4T2G8|3.0|The writing isn't superb but I will have to admit that the relationship between the two main characters is exciting.  There's the back & forth that keeps the reader interested.  The sexual aspect, at first, was great but then, for me, it went a little overboard.  I mean, every damn room... by the time I got to the next two books, I was bored with the sex.<br /><br />I guess I can say that I can totally see why people love this book but I can also see why people hate it.
B000FC2L1E|5.0|This just gets you started so jump in and get the series.  If you love reading books that uses an open mind, you will love this book.
B002O2THRO|5.0|This is a well done adaptation of a classic, with great acting and the period sets are alone worth watching the film.
B008B68IUY|5.0|I brought this to a 7 year old girl's birthday party. She let out a small scream when she opened the gift and continued to play with it the entire night. It holds four dolls. Two sit backwards on the trunk area with seatbelts.  It is rather large so get ready to find a place to put it. All in all I was really happy that I bought the coolest gift at the party.
B00B7FOQCK|5.0|I was looking for a USB Hub and came across this, it has USB 3.0 on all ports so anything that you have that is 3.0 compatible is very fast. The design is the best part since most USB Hubs have the ports right next to one another you usually end up taking more than one port for some items that are wider. This design allows for those wide items to not cover any ports so you get to use all 4. Excellent product, would highly recommend. Right now I have 3 external hard drives hooked up to it, they all work extremely quick at 3.0 speeds no slow down whatsoever.
B00BTHWFBK|4.0|It's a Black Sabbath record!  As a long time Sabbath fan like most, this was my most anticipated album of the year. Now I must just get this out in the clear. When I say I'm a Sabbath fan, I'm a fan I own every album, during every line up, including the two albums Iommi did with Glenn Hughes and all the Heaven and Hell stuff which I always have considered Black Sabbath records. For you Ozzy only fans check out the Dio, Martin era trust me you really are missing out.<br /><br />Well enough of that, here we have \\"13\\".  Does it live up to the hype? No of course it doesn't, but lets be honest most things never do.  However,  what we have here is a pretty solid release from 3 out of the 4 fathers of heavy metal.<br /><br />The first thing that needs to be done before listening to this album is put all that hatred aside towards Ozcorp. (Excuse the Spider-man pun). Ozzy has done quite a bit of shady things to past colleagues and fellow performers. I could be wrong but I feel it was probably mostly Sharon's doing.  However,  he was kicked out of Sabbath all those years ago and even though it due to his attitude and behavior, it was a huge blow to him.  So with all that said I over look all of that.<br /><br />That leads into the Bill Ward controversy. Yes, it's really terrible what happened and they should have given him what he wanted. I miss him terribly when listening to this album. But I've been  listening to Black Sabbath when Iommi was the only original member and I think those records are solid. Tony laid some great riffs on those albums. So what I'm trying to say is as long as Tony Iommi is in the band it will always be Sabbath to me. He stayed on the roller coster for the WHOLE ride. He kept the flag of Black Sabbath flying even in the darkest times.<br /><br />As the ride finally comes to an end he has written some really good riffs on this record. Geezer is still Geezer and his bass is on fire. And then there's Ozzy.  One of the original front man of controversy. His vocals come of a bit flat in parts but considering his age and how much abuse his body has endured he sounds great.<br /><br />There has been talk of some re use of classic Sabbath music. Yes, there is a little of that but why not? Like Rob Zombie once said \\"Black Sabbath are the originators of heavy metal, every metal band that has come after has borrowed from Sabbath\\" So let them revisit some of their music passed.  I really feel every song is good. There are some stand outs. One of which is\\"Methademic\\" which is on the bonus disc on the deluxe edition. Do yourself a favor and buy the deluxe edition. The three tracks on there are very strong. They do not sound like B sides.<br /><br />All in all, this IS a Black Sabbath album. Yes it can be knit picked, but for the time in the lives of these originators they have left us with a very good swan song. The end of the first disc ends with the thunderstorm and the bell. This is a great touch, the band began with that intro and they are leaving with it as their outro. Very nice.<br /><br />This life long Black Sabbath fan is pleased and I can now rest that my favorite band can finally leave that stage with a complete body of work, and what a body of work it is.<br /><br />Cheers!His vocals come of a bit flat in parts but considering his age and how much abuse his body has endured he sounds great.<br /><br />There has been talk of some re use of classic Sabbath music.

I really feel every song is good. There are some stand outs. One of which is\\"Methademic\\" which is on the bonus disc on the deluxe edition. Do yourself a favor and buy the deluxe edition. The three tracks on there are very strong. They do not sound like B sides.<br /><br />All in all, this IS a Black Sabbath album. Yes it can be knit picked, but for the time in the lives of these originators they have left us with a very good swan song. The end of the first disc ends with the thunderstorm and the bell. This is a great touch, the band began with that intro and they are leaving with it as their outro. Very nice.<br /><br />This life long Black Sabbath fan is pleased and I can now rest that my favorite band can finally leave that stage with a complete body of work, and what a body of work it is.<br /><br />Cheers!
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed playing this thought-provoking game with all of its nuances and cleverness.  Takes a couple of very enjoyable hours to beat it.
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|this game is great ya you start out slow and yes there is a buying method but easy to Lvov up and not buy enything kid proof seting and fun for all ages I'm 20 years of age and still play 13th lvl all takes some time to get to it but is possible. highly recamend to people that love the movie. there is a aqua park that unlocks at lvl 10 this game is really fun yes its bit laggie but that would probly go away with HD kindle fire or higher padded.highly recamend:)
B005OYKI1I|5.0|I loved this movie, best one out of the fast movies. It is worth it to watch this movie, make sure to watch the series though.
B005S9ELVC|5.0|fast shipping. the movie is great.have great action and a whole heep of killing..cops on a rampage gangster run and hide
B0064X7FVE|4.0|It provides me with excellent information to use and is provided in a suitable format. I would recommend this app to anyone who utilizes weather info for work or pleasure.
B000KKPN5C|5.0|This is very light, very compact and seems to really work as well as the huge bulky flashes, if not better! Love it!
B00846REIS|5.0|So many of the characters are emotionally damaged which has numerous twists and turns, ups and downs. I like the challenge to see if I can figure out what caused their damage. So easy to get drawn into each character.
B000ID37RM|5.0|It is an excellent well written novel that was adapted for the screen very well.  The acting is superb and the story is rivetting.
B00CATSONE|5.0|Loved this book and was astounded by the injustice Tesla endured.<br />A very well written and easy to read account of an amazing man who truly had an imagination most of us could barely fathom. Tesla himself said that he had trouble distinguishing between reality and imagination so vivid were the images his imagination conjured.<br />A real eye opener.
B002PEP4SC|4.0|After watching all past seasons of CASTLE, I expected a little more depth and more of the Nikki/Rook relationship. Enjoyed.
B00AK57N00|4.0|fun to play would like to see more content for it however in all its a game i find myself playing it.
B009AP2G26|5.0|I LOVE glee. It's a show that I can watch over and over again. The season 4 takes it to a whole new level tho. I love it :)
B007HUD6OS|5.0|Couldn't put it down. I was completely locked into where it was going next. Can't wait for Theo to grow up and become a real lawyer.
B001I9WK14|5.0|I now own this on record cassette vhs cd and now dvd that is how much I love this music and band
B002PJN59M|5.0|Gritty, dirty and real, this epic journey of King Arthur and the knights of the Round Table, brings you in close to the action.<br />One of the best in this genre, if not the best. Great acting and fantastic scenery take you to medieval Camalot.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|This was very well written. I liked the characters and how they evolved. With that said I would recommend this book. It only took me the day to read because I couldn't put it down.
B00BI4BA4C|5.0|I picked up this product because I had heard a couple of songs and thought I'd give them a try.  It doesn't disappoint.  While they never became very famous Dr. Feelgood, does just that, makes you feel good.  There are certain bands out there that didn't get the recognition they deserve - these guys, The Iron City Houserockers and Brinsley Schwartz to name a few.<br />This is one collection of music you must try.
B002DOSBMK|5.0|Although this is R.A. Salvatore's 4th book in the Drizzt series this book is the beginning of Drizzt story. This is by far my favorite book of the series and probably of all Mr. Salvatore books. I highly recommended this book to anyone who wants to learn about Drizzt Do'Urden or to any fantasy and D&D fans who have not yet read it.
6304806434|5.0|the movie came quick like the next day after ordering wich was amazing the dvd case came wrapped in plastic wrapping the dvd itself was clean no scracthes and played well when i wacthed it no complaints just perfect
B005MLOKXA|5.0|The show is consistently entertaining and has fresh material.  I will be happy when the next season is available for streaming.
B00CC1JXYE|3.0|I purchased this case because I wanted more than the Samsung Flip Cover, which does not protect the phone adequately. This case has the S-view window with the transparent plastic that is the selling point of the Samsung Flip Cover, but it also provides excellent protection for the device! The leather feels good and has a very pleasant smell. The phone easily snaps into the case and the cutouts for the lock key, camera and flash, speaker grill, and volume rocker are perfect. The built-in stand is also very well designed. It can be adjusted to allow for different viewing angles and does not fall. The con is that the product is clearly not of the high caliber quality with which it is advertised. It began to fray within months and became unusable. Consider other options first prior to this case.
B008KP6ENE|4.0|For free app of the day this is a pretty enjoyable game. I think once my candy crush saga addiction has run its course I may go to this game.
B009ZXT4BY|1.0|So dumb there is crafting but your timed on creative and not survival.<br />So git the full version it's only 3.99
6305428042|4.0|A good Halloween movie to watch with friends or family...Well worth the money!  Thanks for sending the movie to me.
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|A look into a small part of Ireland`s history as told through the fictional story of one man left on the steps of an orphanage.
1449437524|5.0|A very touching book on the loving and tragic relationship between humans and dogs. Short, great illustrations. The first book I've bought by the author, but I am familiar with his work.
B001DCZ4IW|5.0|A movie not to be missed. It is a classic! If you love Cat Stevens music you will love it even more.
0670014893|4.0|What is most fascinating about this read, is the astonishing timing of it ... considering the recent U.S. surveillance revelations thanks to former NSA contractor Edward Snowden, and the issue of corporate outsourcing of intelligence work, this book could not have been released at a better time ... Le Carre has somehow managed to stay ahead of the curve -- again, remarkable ... as for the book, I will only say I enjoyed it -- perhaps because I am partial to his work ... the first 100 pages are mostly setup, and then, whammo ... you're hooked, in true Le Carre fashion ... in light of the Snowden case, this book is not only a must read, but an essential read ... truly, there is nowhere to hide ...
0765325950|4.0|This provides a wrap-up for the Wheel of Time series. A lot of questions were answered but a number were left unanswered. I expect that Sanderson did what he could with Jordan's extant notes but I think that had Jordan lived, the last three volumes might have turned into at least 5 volumes. There was a sense of incompleteness to this book that disappointed somewhat in that it felt like the results of a paucity of notes rather than &#34;part of a larger world incompleteness&#34; that one gets from Tolkien's LOTR trilogy.<br /><br />For instance, some of the foretellings and Min's visions were left without resolution. I think that Jordan would have most likely incorporated such instances into his final books but had probably left only the sketchiest of notes regarding them; thus, Sanderson, wisely, did not attempt to flesh out what was not there. This is not a critcism of Sanderson, just a lament for Jordan's untimely demise.
B005R32L66|4.0|I use Skype to communicate with people in Asia... It is an excellent program for economic communication across continents. I highly recommend it.
B00498YZH8|3.0|Maybe it was just me but I couldn't pay full attention to this movie, and I did not understand the plot, other than that the authorities were looking for the young woman's father.  Other than that, the story escaped me.  I thought Jennifer Lawrence's acting was great.  Eventually they did find her father, dead, but I felt the movie lacked an emotional connectivity.  It seemed like the events in the movie were disconnected.  The camera kept flashing onto pictures of the animals on the farm, so yes, she and her two young siblings lived on a farm, but what purpose did that serve?  Then she was training her sister and brother to shoot a gun and kill animals for eating, but how did this relate to the entire story about the father being missing?  So they were self-sufficient - so what?  Eventually Jennifer's character succeeds in providing for her family and gets the authorities off her back.  Good.  Other than these themes, I felt it didn't have a cohesive, moving plot or good character development.  At the end of it, I was asking myself &#34;That's it?&#34;
B0064J6OMO|4.0|If you are looking for a good laugh and like these actors you will like this movie.  Enjoy the fun!
B00A8MGIZG|1.0|wish i had never bought this movie. story line was hard to follow with a none climatic ending, very poor movie.
B000LTAY1U|3.0|You will be amazed at the quality of this watch for such a cheap price however it's just too small for the current trend. 5 years ago it would have been fine, but it just can't run with the 46mm behemoth watches that everyone's wearing. That being said, 39 to 40mm would have been ideal for this watch.
B0010SKUYM|5.0|I love this book.  I downloaded on recommendation of Leo Leport on TWIT TV.  I am glad I downloaded it and enjoyed it before seeing the cover art.  That jacket is horrible!!! it makes it look like some sort of bodice ripper romance!  It is an adventure novel, with only the romance that is appropriate for the story line. In this volume the main character is a boy so that is not a whole lot.  If you liked Harry Potter, you will like this one, but be advised that you might want to read it first and decide if it is too adult for your child.  I personally don't think so, but my parents let me read anything when I was growing up, including books like Far From the Madding Crowd.
B002UBRFDC|5.0|Great book. You won't be disappointed. One of the best, if not best, historical fiction books about Japan and the samurai.
0756405890|5.0|Finished this book recently and absolutely loved it. The world is complex and realistic, Kvothe is a smug, prideful, charismatic protagonist that you can't help but root for. The way the novel begins is unique, and the language the author uses is flowing, precise, descriptive, and all around distinguishes this book from many of the other fantasy novels out there. When I had about 80 pages left in the book I had already decided I would order the next book in the series. A wonderful buy by anyone's standards. I hope this series will gain further recognition as time goes on.
B00BTHWFBK|5.0|im so extatic about this turn of events.  slow and rythmic but somehow heavier than ever.  this harkens back to the glory days of metal, when musicians played for the passion of the song, the baslines, the high caotic beauty of the guitar solo, the blood stains of the moshpit.  this is an amazing uncompromizing album to my ears.  but this is just my humble opinion.
B00COGZ8FU|4.0|Great action. Held my attention. I would recommend. Great for anyone that likes Tom Cruise, action movies, mission impossible buffs.
B004DWKO8Y|4.0|Good CD and music not as good as the old stuff, but it's hard to recapture that sound. I still would buy again.
B00C1N9JWO|5.0|I glanced at the reviews very briefly before beginning this book. I will admit to doing a double take at number of 5-star reviews. I became a little suspicious, a little dismayed. Surely Heart of Obsidian couldn't be THAT good, could it? My inner doubting Thomas is happy to say oh, yes. Yes, it really is THAT good.<br /><br />All of the plot points have been hit by others, and really, all I want to say is this book is, hands down, the best meshing of plot propelling action and heart touching romance I can ever remember reading. To say Ms. Singh hit this out of the park is an understatement. The ball is still in the air, heading out of the stratosphere. Kaleb is a man of astonishing depth, the history of his relationship with Sahara as well as the present is just breathtaking in its intensity. Sahara is a strong woman, resilient and loving. Sahara should be named Oasis, as that is what she has always been to Kaleb. So. Good. Together.<br /><br />In what is one of the consistently best series on the shelves today, Heart of Obsidian comes in as one of the best books in the outstanding series. It hits every single high note. Just a fantastic read, beginning to end.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Great show.  Love how the interactions between the characters are subtle yet dramatic. This is a great show and worth watching
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is really great!!! If you like Temple Run or Angry Gran Run you should try this game out.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Another good book!  This is a great story and I agree with some that not a ton happened in this book but I am very much looking forward to the next and am happy this wasn't the last book!  Hope the next book comes out soon.  I love Gideon and the passion the two of them have for each other.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway surfers is one of the best apps in the store. I would recommend it to everyone. It is a great game. FIVE STARS
B000059TEP|5.0|It is a great ghost suspense movie. I love Demi and Patrick in this one. The shipping was here on time and in the quality they said.
B00AQF8CJ0|5.0|This game is really fun, and keeps me engaged. I have had a lot of fun working through all the puzzles and challenges.
B002HWRYJE|4.0|I love the whole Star Trek idealisms. So I'm already incline to a positive reaction. There's a lot of sarcasm in my review, but I did honestly love this movie.<br /><br />To start I want to express my irritation at the lighting affects. In the special exerts, the director brags about using \\"flares\\" of light to make the movie more believable (I forgot the special term he used, biological?). All it did was make it look like sixties poor visual filming and irritate my eyes. I see that he did the same thing with the next movie. Agh! Many people have light sensitivities and illnesses which this will cause a problem for. Thanks a lot, Jerk!<br /><br />There are lot of logistics and missings that just don't make sense. I'm not even going into the paradox of when Spok will have to try and save Romulus from the super nova in the altered reality. If he does destroy their sun, will the planet then freeze to death?<br /><br />They needed to be more careful about the stupid little things. Like Spok calling Lieutenant O'Hura a lieutenant right out of cadet school. Don't they have promotions? And when the assembly gets together to make Kirk a captain there are too many people. They just lost seven ships of cadets, which I will add that no one mourned for. Did O'Hura shed a tear for her dead roommate? Was she on one of the obliterated ships?<br /><br />Why didn't Valcon or Earth try to stop the drilling? Some effort would have been appreciated.<br /><br />I loved the action and personal interactions of the crew. It was interesting that the altered reality needed the same people as crew and went ridiculously out there to put the crew together. They did a great job of casting. The actors seemed very natural with each other.<br /><br />The melody which flows through the entire movie is very haunting. It's interesting that with different instruments they get different levels of energy. Wasn't there any money put aside for other pieces? Probably, too much was spent on flash-lights.
B009KS4XRO|1.0|it never works the way it should, I purchased bingo games and after playing some games it froze and I lost all the bingo's that I had left which was quite a lot.. I contacted buffalo studios, they acknowledged the letter but did nothing about it, that a few months ago very disappointed..  A few Days ago I decided to download it again, and it still does not work....
B00BWJARHO|5.0|Liked this very much--great embellishment of the simple storyline.  Interesting characters, engaging transformation in Bilbo.  Can't wait to see the next film!
B00821OX98|5.0|This is a really great show!  The acting is great and the story is extremely interesting.  Can't wait for season 3!
B005UG53NS|4.0|I enjoyed the movie very much.  If you liked the Harry Potter series  at all, you'll like this movie.  Filled with action and lots of magical fighting, how can you go wrong?
B00AG297GK|4.0|Better than Bruno for sure. It was more scripted with less real unsuspecting people which was disappointing. Overall a good movie.
B002MGJOBQ|5.0|Love the directors cut!  With a little extra time from added scenes, it makes the movie that much more enjoyable!  It also makes it easier to understand with the interspersed shots of the Philosophy Of Time Travel book shown throughout.  You can pause the movie and read paragraphs from the book which bring the movie into focus for people confused as to what is happening.  A big difference is the sound track.  The directors cut plays an almost totally different mix of songs, and  changes the order of others.  Very cool!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It's the best game I've ever played! I got over300,000 points for my high score!!!!!  If it cost any thing it would be worth it. I have two words for you, GET IT!!!!!! You'll love it. ; 3&gt;. Also my mom got over 2,000,000 points! Can you believe that!?
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Such a fun app . I'm addicted! I love completing all the tasks and competing. I do,however, wish there was an easier way go get other horses since most of th  other  horse breeds require a ridiculous amount of gems which are difficult to get
B00992CF6W|5.0|This is the best game ever. Besides survivalcraft. To maker, please put more things in like fishing poles,creeper eggs, zombie eggs, blaze eggs, you know all that stuff. It would be so cool if you put pony eggs too. One question... how do you mine Redstone or is it even possible. I also have the Xbox 360 version too. Oh yeah, can you put in villager eggs too? My little pony eggs would be AWESOME!!! I liked my little pony my whole life and it would be cool to fly on ponies all the time. Please make my comments come true. And answer my questions. Thanks!!!!!!!!
B0064MPXFA|5.0|This show keeps you wanting for more. I can't stop waiting it. I absolutely love Alicia. Her character is dynamic, vulnerable and very human.
B00CH87HF4|4.0|WARNING: My review is for the iPad version so I can't attest to the Android stability although based on the reviews already, I'm guessing it's not an issue.<br /><br />I've been playing the Dungeon Hunter series on the iPhone (then iPad) since the first game which was a blast!  Dungeon Hunter 4 blows all its predecessors out of the water!  The character detail has definitely improved, but the environment is beautiful, reminding me of Torchlight 2 (PC game).  True it's a hack 'n slash with shallow story, but that doesn't stop me from playing and grinning the whole time!  The micro-transaction is fairly innovative.  So far (not finished with game), I haven't felt that I HAD to spend real money.  I usually end up spending $1-5 to support the developers, but I prefer for it to be my choice and not part of a bait and switch tactic too many games employ (i.e. you get half-way through and then CAN'T progress until you spend money to level up or upgrade).  When you upgrade armor/weapons (etc), there is a delay (so far 2-6 min) before it takes effect.  Or, you spend a \\"gem\\" to have it instantly take effect. That's fair.  You do (rarely) collect gem's and start off with 100 (not much).  But realistically, the uber cool gear and upgrades come from spending money.  I'm okay with stock equipment.  It hasn't hindered my playing and actually turns what could be an ultra easy game into a little bit of a challenge at times.  To earn 5 stars, I would like to see a little more story development, but that's really a minor point with the amount of fun you will have.<br /><br />Bottom line: Gameloft has continued to show their gaming prowess and willingness to commit to a franchise with Dungeon Hunter. For free, you CAN'T go wrong and probably will have a good bit of fun along the way.
B0051E9JNE|3.0|Hasn't aged well.  Not bad mind you, just quite a bit more cheesy than when it was released...that's it in a nutshell.
B0012GTZC0|5.0|It was hard to put the book down.  I would recommend this book to my husband and my sister.  I like learning history even when I am reading fiction.
B004S5N7T4|5.0|Another great read from Peter Robinson.  The man can do no wrong.  His characterisation is superb and the plot keeps you on the edge of your seat and up late at night because you don't want to put it down.  His DCI Banks series presents a true and authentic representation of policing in Britain.
B00BDSRKHO|5.0|The album will take you back to the old days with some kraftwerk sounds, and no wonder Karl Bartos produced one of the songs. Great album for synth-pop lovers!
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|Fun but short. Can't wait to see what the next episodes are like. Hopefully they are free..let's get to business
B006VFLIYK|4.0|Great character establishment followed up with a fast pace.  I hate the metaphor of a page turner because isn't that what all books are?  But the action was non stop.  Unfortunately, the end came and went a little abruptly.  It's almost as if Baldacci only could have so many pages and didn't want to edit out anything prior to the ending so he made the climax come and go as fast as any of the other action.  Nobody wants an ending that drags on and you won't get that with The Innocent.  But there easily could have been another chapter in the end detailing how the villain found out who the good guy was.  Kind of a big part to the whole story that just goes untold.  All in all a good, entertaining book.
B0041VXGRS|3.0|I have made cake pops twice befor receiving this book. Now I have somewhere to look for many more ideas when I am ready to plan another party. Also some tips to make it easier and more successful.
B002MC9H8K|5.0|I would recomand this book.This is really a hard one, wise, exciting and sad, with lots of interesting perspectives on being human.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|Reminds me of the children's show caillou because nobody really liked him either. And support alert... Helen raped Charlie lol
6304806418|5.0|great movie... if ya dont' like madonna, this may change your mind........and Antonio bandarass is the best........great voice for this type of production
B0002VFXFE|4.0|I wanna start by saying that the paste it self works wonders, if you're looking for an amazing paste that keeps temps low and gets the job done look no further this will be your thermal paste of choice. I really have no complaints besides the point that there's really not a lot of past for the price paid, for $9 I feel as if they could have included more paste for that price point. The tube is really tiny. at the end of the day It's a really good product and it does what it's suppose to do.
B008220BLG|5.0|I loved it. I do not think I ever saw a zombie movie with a real resoultion before.  Even though it was a little fluffy and cute like bunnies and Twilight I really enjoyed the end.
B005PK56TA|5.0|Really good show, keeps you wondering and keeps your attention. Wish the next season was out and not so expensive per episode.. Cannot wait to watch more..
B00AIBZLVY|3.0|Although the movie has such a great and new theme the ending is not so great.  Knowing this in advance makes it a better movie.
B0085YOD1A|2.0|One expect a lot from a paid app. I don't believe this app has any quality for it being a paid app.<br />Had it not being for Amazon free app of the day, I would have lost my money on it.<br />The battery interface has no great functionality. The time remaining for the battery is always in error.<br />Crap App. Uninstalled.
B00BSBUZPK|4.0|The content is awesome but the DVD arrived with serious faults on the surface whch cause it to skip and freeze.  I only played it once and now I need to wipe it down vigorously to get it to work properly.  I always clean the lens on my player and it fails on multiple DVD players.  I would really like a replacement product.
B0089LOG02|5.0|I never knew about the &#34;orphan trains.&#34; I can only imagine the horror of being placed in some of these &#34;homes.&#34; Amazing to think of it.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|This book has me at the first sentence. For the first time I had a whole cat of people in my head. lol really wish this was made into a movie..good I would enjoy that!!
0670014893|5.0|As spies don't come in from the Cold War any longer, I did wonder how those who mined that for spy thrillers would adjust. I needn't have worried. A master writer is always a master writer and telling the tale is the compulsion they work under. The tale has shifted to terrorists, which opens the whole world as a subject as terrorists lurk everywhere. What always separated LeCarre from the rest who mined the Cold War was that the story had to be well plotted, characters had to be plausible if flawed, and the writing had to be perfect. This story begins slowly as he lays down all the threads and it seems disjointed. It takes a while to pull it together, but never fear, it will happen. By the time you get to the end, it's a tightly woven tale. Glad he's still writing and I hope he never stops.
B003UESJF6|5.0|Just a lot of fun.  I enjoyed how the opening dilemma was solved in the end. Didn't see it coming.
B0036TGSIK|1.0|If not for certain elements, I would have given the movie 3 stars for its comedic elements and acting.<br /><br />While I realize that glorifying sex of all orientations is standard Hollywood fare these days, I bristled at the disgraceful and degrading depiction of ALL Christians. It's one thing to poke fun at stereotypes, another to push the knife into a religious group and twist it, just for kicks. The Christians I know are nothing like the brainless brutes represented in the film. They deserve better.<br /><br />Parents, you do NOT want your kids to see this flick.
B00D3V8PSC|5.0|I downloaded the new Black Sabbath album, 13, last night and have listened to it thrice over today.  My thoughts: Much better than I expected.  This is some pretty amazing stoner/sludge/doom metal.  Heavy, oppressive, existential, and replete with the kind of religious allusions that make fundies cringe - in other words, it is classic Black Sabbath.  For best listening connect your MP3 player to your surround sound system and turn it up loud.
B00C7JGDBW|1.0|This movie is pretty but that's about it. The special effects felt cheap and plastic (like this should have been a TV mini series, not a feature film). You knew you were locked in a huge sound stage some where (no rainbow in sight) and the actors seemed bored. I have no idea why Bruce Campbell was in this, he didn't do anything for this film and even added to the TV feeling. The very best things about this movie are the little girl doll and the flying monkey bellhop. The story line was a bit too adult, dealing with murder, betrayal and lost innocence. Oz is nothing more than a cheating liar so it's hard to like him at all even when he tries to change. If you really want to know about Oz buy the first movie and read the books instead.
B00992CF6W|5.0|You should change the pictures because minecraft pocket updated .<br /><br />Also its a good game because the new update made it so you can use water and lava without pocket inv editor pro.
B00CFA222M|1.0|The idea is good and the computer animation is good (except for the first few minutes of the film when it looks like a cheap PS2 game). The giants are disgusting, the bad guy is doing his best to be evil and the good guy is cute and totally clueless (as usual). The princess is pretty and also clueless and the King is off in his own world (as usual). The Knight is funny but his hair style upstages him, no matter what happens (wind, rain, giant attack) it doesn't move an inch (Sir Gel of the Perfect Hair). I didn't know they had super hair gel back then. Watch this one when it comes on TV and save yourself some money to buy Iron Man 3 instead, you'll be so glad you did.
B000LPQ6DE|5.0|I really like this Jane Eyre!! This had very new and unexpected passionate elements I really found very very fun!
B004SQS9FA|5.0|So different from the Radiohead I have known, and I LOVE it, love it, love it.  I cannot tell you why in coherent, musical terms, I can only say their music grabbed me in a way music hasn't grabbed my mind in a very long time.  I am so energized and happy and feel like I can take on the world after hearing some of these songs, and I'm not even bipolar...other songs leave me pleasantly peaceful.  Why ese would I be here, downloading this music?
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|A very good story line and amazing puzzles. The graphics. were really good. I really enjoy playing these types of games.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|This show is incredibly riveting and keeps me on the edge of my seat.<br /><br />The stories and cases that they work on are brilliantly creative and well written.<br /><br />There is the perfect amount of suspense, drama, and a touch of comedy to draw in any fan.<br /><br />I watched all of the latest season live and now am trying to catch up on the previous seasons.<br /><br />Bottom Line: I just can't get enough of this show! Suits and The Good Wife are my two favorite law shows of all-time.
B0074D3CAQ|4.0|This book had a very unusual plot, but it kept my interest the whole way through.  A good read and will make for some interesting discussion at our next book group meeting (The Rivah Readers).
B001GKJ2DO|4.0|and Meryl Streep is an extra bonus.  Makes me want to sing along and continue for the rest of the day.

B004LROMQG|5.0|Totally enjoyable. Sorry to see the series end. I hope BBC will consider a new series at a later date.
B00C1BTWV4|5.0|Movie sound was awesome and the plot was the best I've seen in many years. I would definitely recommend this movie to all.
B00C7JG0KG|1.0|Burn me once, that's all it takes.  I received my order today and was surprised to find no 2d version of the movie.  Someone else wrote that I can buy it from Disney Rewards for six bucks!  Thanks, they got all the money they are getting from me.  My fault.  But not again.  I am now edgimakated.
B001IBIHQ4|5.0|What an astonishing achievement this show is. There are things here I never dreamed I'd see on TV. HBO and all the people behind getting this series made are to be commended.<br /><br />The mini-series covers the experiences of several marines in the war against Japan in WW2. The war memoirs of Eugene Sledge and Robert Leckie form the basis of the screenplay, with several other marines, in particular John Basilone, featured to varying degrees. The common thread is their service in the 1st Marine Division but the men concerned served with different sub-units and in different campaigns (and John Basilone was with the 4th Division for Iwo Jima). Accordingly the series doesn't have the cohesion that was attained in covering the exploits of Easy Company in Band of Brothers. I didn't mind this though. The war in the Pacific was a wide ranging one and its events took place over a much longer time frame than its predecessor was concerned with.<br /><br />The stand-out feature of The Pacific are the battle scenes. They are grisly, loud and confronting. I never thought I'd see war carnage as graphic as this on TV. The makers have also, across the four campaigns, Guadalcanal, Cape Glouster (on Bouganville), Peleliu and Okinawa shown the battles quite differently. These take into account the different types of actions, tactics and conditions on each island. Each campaign also sees an increase in brutality and this allows the deterioration of the men, particularly Sledge, to be shown to vivid effect. Indeed by the end, the men are sick of war and killing, sick of each other and simply sick. It is a long way from the comraderie of Easy Co.<br /><br />While I want to concentrate my review on The Pacific, the relationship to Band of Brothers needs to be addressed. I have read many people say The Pacific is not as good. Certainly it has no character as compelling as Dick Winters. I think it is also clear that `Brothers' is more enjoyable but it is in this that the strength of The Pacific lies. It is a far grimmer, visceral and more shocking portrayal of war. On this and several other points, I think The Pacific is more personal and more powerful.<br /><br />This is a show for adults. Aside from very graphic war violence, there is profane language and sex scenes and concepts. The most confronting element though is the descent into darkness, culminating on Okinawa, where the basic humanity of the characters frays to a thread. It is perhaps an antidote, or at least a reality-check to the glowing/glorifying depiction of war that BOB was at times. A theme common to both series is that though war is horrible, sometimes you get an enemy that simply must be fought. After watching the Pacific you're in no doubt what this entails in its entirety.
B00160FBWK|5.0|This is our families all time favorite. it is a movie you can see over a and over and never get tired of watching it.

B005R32L66|4.0|As long as the other people you are speaking with have Skype & not messenger, it works great.  Otherwise you or the other person will not get any messages.  Never had a problem but I do not have it running all day/night.
B000HKYOK0|5.0|It's classic star trek, What could be better? And you can what them in order! Its a fun way the spend an afternoon on the couch!
B009O2XY12|5.0|I can get SO caught up in this game!  I love it
B000JMKQX0|5.0|It was an easy and fun read. A totally different approach to the typical apocalypse novel. Effectively and realistically written. Highly recommend to zombie or apocalyptic genre lovers!
B00CO8D3G4|5.0|\\"His whole 'message' is<br />one that at first glance looks like an enormous platitude: If men would<br />behave decently the world would be decent.\\"<br /><br />George Orwell on Charles Dickens<br /><br />James Altucher is one of those people who seems to have done everything. He's started and sold many companies, been married, divorced, been worth millions, reduced to poverty. And sprung back. He has a popular blog, written several books, and sits on the boards of many companies. He's able to look at his loses and success with candor. And he freely gives advice.<br /><br />The theme of his latest book, Choose Yourself, is that humanity has arrived at a unique moment in history: it is now possible to create the person you want to be, i.e., \\"choose yourself'. The book is filled with advice, daily meditations, stories of success and loss, and generally good ideas. He warns us the old days of \\"the company will take care of you for life is over\\". After the crash of 2008, companies used the crisis to dump employees they didn't need any longer.<br /><br />The book is a fun read. The author has plenty of advice on how to stay healthy, start a company, stay married and how to be a decent person. I read it in 2 days and found myself chuckling frequently.<br /><br />If I have one criticism with the book, it's an occassional tendency of Mr. A to contridict himself. For instance, he is constantly reminding the reader that you need to quit your job because your boss hates you. But, at the same time, he warns people about quitting their jobs right away. Wait until you have some cash flowing in.<br /><br />I recommend Choose Yourself for anyone looking for some good solid buisness and personal advice.
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|i love this app so much!!! i play it all the time and i cant put it down!! my kindle is kinda messed up a little so i cant use it while its charging :( and while its doing that i just sssssoooooo eager to play it!!!!! =^.^=
1451635672|4.0|This  a thorough telling of the history of Tony Spilotro and Frank Rosenthal ( Nicky and Ace from the movie Casino).  Overall a very interesting introduction to this part of the Mafia in Las Vegas and the Chicago syndicate.  A little dry at times and would benefit From some narrative from more than just Frank Rosenthal.  But well worth reading.
B008UCJ7KO|2.0|I am with all the the other reviews.  Does Sylvia Day have ADHD?  This book was a mess and she seemed to be grasping for where to go with the story.  She kept introducing small tidbits and then left them hanging.  I am also getting sick of Eva, first she's mad, then she talks herself out of it.  I really do feel sorry for Gideon.  I loved the other 2 books, but this one not so much.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I love this 3rd book in the series. Great continuation and I am definitely looking forward to the next one.
B00633PFQC|5.0|A page turner and very objectively analysed. Il loved it and will keep it as reference. I recommend it ot professionals and non professionnal likewise
B009VIZDLI|4.0|What a delightful story. I had identified with the lead character after only two pages then enjoyed following his progress throughout the book at times laughing out loud at his social ineptness, very entertaining.
