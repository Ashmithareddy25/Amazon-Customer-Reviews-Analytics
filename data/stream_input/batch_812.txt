B00192KCQ0|5.0|My son is 30, and I'm 59. We both love Metallica. He will listen to Led Zeppelin, and we both saw Metallica live 10 years ago. What an album! I have to be careful when my wife gets into the car. With my Bose stereo, it is so easy to blow the doors off my car on the way to work. I've always liked Metallica, because James doesn't just stand there and scream. He actually sings. Kirk is as good a guitar player as there is....he just doesn't do speed riffs. He can play like Satriani and then crunch with the best of them. It's nice for us old dudes to have a band that still plays to our heavy metal needs!
B00005MCWZ|4.0|Hawkwind's first album is interesting in that it contains both the bands best AND worst songs.    Now, I try to be positive every chance I can get, especially when it comes to music, because I've been listening to music for many years and my hope is that I've learned to appreciate that many bands take a LOT of time to properly figure out.    So that's why I give Hawkwind's debut album 4 stars, instead of 2 or 3, because a 4 is just more appropriate for a band that would soon become one of hard rocks very best.    Let's talk about the best songs first- \\"Hurry On Sundown\\", with some AWESOME harmonica playing and beautifully brilliant vocals... this is truly a spectacular song!  \\"Be Yourself\\" has some wonderful saxophone jamming that leads into some equally impressive guitar soloing.  I love this song a lot.  And finally, the CCR-sounding \\"Mirror of Illusion\\", with a John Fogerty-like vocal melody that's both melodic and EXTREMELY good.      The bad songs would be the two \\"Paranoia\\" tracks.  It's NOT a good idea to repeat the same 4 or 5 notes for several minutes.  \\"Seeing It As You Really Are\\" kind of follows the same idea, with too much of it dominated with repeating notes.  However in this case, the song eventually drifts into a really good guitar solo and a little bit of melodic saxophone playing at the end making it a pretty good jam.      I recommend buying the album for the three songs I mentioned above, but the band would become MUCH more consistent starting as soon as the next album.
0307269752|4.0|Grown-up. That's the word that kept popping into my head as I read \\"Girl with the Dragon Tattoo.\\" Submerged in America's adolescent culture, especially in the middle of a name-calling election featuring someone who celebrates her own ignorance, I found the seriousness and complexity of this book refreshing and somewhat shocking. Larsson's style takes a little getting used to, especially if you've read a lot of American thrillers with their gimcrack plots and facile characters. This is more like something by P.D. James or Elizabeth George, without the familiar settings and cultural tropes. But the central characters are fascinating, and the mystery soon sucks you in. That said, it would have been nice to have few concessions to the U.S. reader like a map of Sweden or a currency converter: Is a million kroner actually a lot of money? But in all, reading this book gave me hope: If there's a country out there where people have grown-up relationships, think deeply and treat life like more than an extended airing of \\"The Price is Right,\\" there may be hope for the planet after all.
B0016NF06O|5.0|Two of the best!  If you thought Wille was only country, guess what?  This is one smooth CD.
B00004WG2F|4.0|Legends of the Fall starring Brad Pitt is a moving and extremely weepy romantic drama. This film made Pitt a star and sex symbol, his acting is brilliant, not just another pretty face. Anthony Hopkins, Henry Thromas, and Aidan Quinn also star. Julia Ormond plays the young lady of the three brothers affection, she has feelings for all of the them especially Tristan (Pitt) but their love cannot endure and tragedy strikes and the ending may leave you shocked and disappointed but I highly recommend this strong and passionate story, enjoy!
0743496736|4.0|19 Minutes is a well written, interesting and thought provoking book.    It took me a little while to really get into it but, once I was there I couldn't put it down.  And there certainly was much food for thought. This book makes you question the values, perhaps, we may pass on to our children.  A question that stays with you long after you have finished the final page.      I definitely recommend \\"19 Minutes\\" to anyone and everyone.
0451529308|4.0|I have seen the movie, both the old and new version.  I truly like the story, but as a male student required to read this prior to 8th grade, I think I would have rather read \\"Little Men.\\"
B000QXDED6|2.0|This is a very graphic movie.  The violence here is unlike any other movie I've seen.  It's not incredibly disturbing, just gory and unneccessary.  Having a ton of scenes in slow motion does not make a movie epic.  The story is OK but not unlike many other movies about the same time period.  The actors are good.  I don't buy the hype though.
031606792X|5.0|The product got here earlier than the time indicated. I was off guard but super excited! It arrived in great shape too. Thanks
B000DWMN2S|5.0|This DVD is based on the book by JSF.  This is a movie you will appreciate if you appreciate art and detail.  It's not a summer blockbuster for sure.  The movie carefully takes you through the story and you feel like you are walking alongside the characters.  It's a great story and the actors do a great job in their roles.  I recommend this movie especially if you have been to Eastern Europe for any length of time.
B00192KCQ0|5.0|It's been a long five years since Metallica released St. Anger after experiencing some of their greatest trials and uncertainties. While St. Anger was raw, emotional, and unrelenting (and perhaps a little unfocused), Death Magnetic is a wonderful presentation of the band's always existing strong compositional skills that still manages to embrace the heart of their earlier works. Case in point, the return of the purely instrumental song in \\"Suicide & Redemption\\" - classical and at times orgasmic, it's crafted from the same kind of mold that gave birth to \\"The Call of Ktulu\\" and \\"Orion.\\" A song like \\"My Apocalypse\\" retains some characteristics of its St. Anger siblings, but other songs like \\"All Nightmare Long\\" exhibit a rough-edged flair that is gracefully accompanied by more refined rhythms. Plus, riffing solos are back and Lars remembered to tighten up his snare this time around.    The album appears to gradually re-evolve from the unbridled passion that is its immediate predecessor into a fitting homage to its earlier inspirations. Fans of Metallica's earlier albums that were a little put off by St. Anger will find plenty to love in Death Magnetic. Despite what appears to be the lack of a quality mix (some songs seem to snap and crackle and Trujillo is somewhat of an afterthought), whether intentional or not, this new album comes highly recommended.    Songs of particular note include \\"Suicide & Redemption\\", \\"The Day That Never Comes\\", \\"All Nightmare Long\\" and \\"Broken, Beat & Scarred.\\"
B0006399FS|5.0|This is a great album, and I am no avid U2 fan, as this album and Achtung Baby were the first U2 albums I bought.<br /><br />Most of the songs on this album move and change in their progression, so this is no collection of rhymes on repeat, but a well-thought-out, provocative work of some complexity.<br /><br />It has a few rockers (Vertigo, Love and Peace, All Because of You), some beauty (Sometimes You Can't Make It on Your Own, City of Blinding Lights, A Man and A Woman), and a couple mid-tempo wonders (Crumbs From Your Table and Original of the Species (and this one with an ending reminiscent of the best of the Rolling Stones).<br /><br />Great album, don't miss it!  5 stars!  Ok, it's not perfect (it's not easy finding perfect albums), but really all the songs, except for the ok Yahweh, are very good.  I had to add the fifth star to make up for the below-four-star average I noticed here.  Still it doesn't get much better than this.
0596522347|5.0|Duarte has been doing presentation design for a long time and it was nice to finally see a book from Nancy Duarte on their methodology of presentation design.  It was informative and instructive, but not entirely prescriptive (which would have been better in some cases). However the insights she provides are worth the purchase and I found this book a keeper.
1582701709|5.0|This is one of my favorite books!  I do  believe in the law of attraction. That if you think positive that positive things will happen to you.  It does help when you know what you want, and strive to get what you want.  But I do have a hard time believing things like natural disasters and health can be controlled. I have recommended this book to a lot of people, and will continue to do so.  It did give me the confidence to follow my dreams!
B00006BTCA|5.0|The best metaphors to describe this album is a moire pattern. Moire occurs when two sets of parallel lines intersect, like when you cross two screen doors or videotape a CRT television. The result is a bulging curve that is drawn from the parallel lines. This is Interpol's music. The guitar parts taken individually are pretty simple and repetitive, but they intersect and play off of each other to create bounding moire patterns that are both grounded yet defying gravity. The drum and bass undercurrents are both stiff and lucid at the same time. The amazing thing is that none of it feels cold, clinical, or planned; even though the music itself is cool, it's never cold. There's still a lively messiness to the parts, like they're overflowing into each other, like they're the tightest and the most adventurous jam band in the world.    It is very easy to create a weightless South Park farce. Lesser bands really don't have any purpose or logic behind their guitar parts, it's like they spin a plastic wheel to decide which notes to play next. Or, the compositions are so stale that it feels like it was composed in a word processor first. Interpol stands out to me as better than the rest, even better than their \\"predecessors\\" such as Joy Division or the Chameleons, who bear superficial similarities but don't share any structural similarities. One of the best albums of the 2000's.
B000NDIAWY|5.0|I discovered Brandi Carlile while listening to an atomobile ad during the Olympics.  Her music is very enjoyable and easy to listen to.  I couldn't get \\"The Story\\" out of my head, so I HAD to have the CD.  I enjoy the rest of the songs also.  A great addition to our collection.

B000002L61|1.0|Frankly, it's all very boring. The lyrics are no better, he writes about gnomes, trolls, dark elves and evil forests. It's obvious the guy played D & D (Dungeons & Dragons ) in the early 80's and probably has an oujia board in his closet. His voice is excruciatingly annoying, he whines through all the songs and then there are the corny guitar solos that make me want to puke. On one song they are even bold enough to add keyboards like a bunch of other crap 80's metal bands that didn't know where to go music wise. Most metal heads think this junk is classic but its not worth your time, that is, if you are a truly sane person.
0743277708|5.0|When Fiver has an ominous premonition that death will come to the warren, his brother Hazel leads a pack of willing bucks out into the wide world. Their journey takes them through challenges and strange encounters, and Hazel must grow to be a cunning leader that he may found and protect a better warren in a safer land. Although it requires a certain suspension of disbelief, Watership Down is remarkably faithful to the animals which inspire it. The constantly involving plot can make for slow  reading, but on the whole this is an intelligent, compelling, strongly written work. I highly recommend it.<br /><br />Watership Down differs hugely from most anthropomorphic animal stories in that in that it remains quite faithful to its source. That is to say: these rabbits are rabbits. They do not wear clothes or cook meals in a kitchen; I'm not a rabbit expert, but it's clear that Adams has researched, and for the most part his depiction of rabbits and other wildlife is convincing. Sometimes the novel does stretch the suspension of disbelief--the rabbits don't have human lifestyles or intelligence, but there are still an unbelievable number of unusual rabbit behaviors, from singing and laughing rabbits to a militarized warren. Nonetheless, Watership Down is refreshingly realistic, and the story is all the more compelling for the fact that it could indeed occur in the country downs.<br /><br />As a novel rather than a concept alone, Watership Down is sometimes slow but largely skillful. The premise--that a group of disaffected rabbits leave one warren to found another--is only mere glimpse into the overall plot, which includes a journey across the countryside, dealings with two other unusual warrens, and a lengthy search for does. The plot is constantly unfolding and the book is quite long, and so it sometimes feels like slow going. Once the reader adjusts to the unfolding plotline, however, the book becomes easier to read--and it is remarkably well written. With thoughtful detail and a complex plot, lifelike characters and skillful writing, Watership Down is on the whole an intelligent and strongly written book. It is heavier fare than many anthropomorphic-animal stories, and it has some faults, but on the whole it's a joy to read, engaging and thought-provoking, with plentiful interpretations which will stand up to rereads. I was very satisfied, and I highly recommend it.lex plot, lifelike characters and skillful writing, Watership Down is on the whole an intelligent and strongly written book.

B00003CY0V|3.0|This is a seriously flawed movie. It so wants to be cool, but misses the target by a long way. Sure its fits the critera of a high octane movie, but it has no soul. That said, for its time (2001) its not without intelligence. The concept of external non-government privately run organisations in the U.S. being involved in taking out terrorists etc is now a virtual fact (Blackwater).<br /><br />Furthermore Travolta IS cool, especially in the riveting opening sequence. Halle Berry looks great and overall Hugh Jackman probably gives the best acting performance. But these plus points are spoilt by an over-reliance on car-chases, explosions and gun fights. This has all been done before and so much better, and with a lot more style. See Michael Mann's Heat for one.<br /><br />Overall then its an average, but hugely overblown blockbuster. If you like that sort of thing thats fine, and if its cheap you'll probably buy it. I would rent first...
B0017R5UAA|3.0|The first full length album by the Fleet Foxes is a folksy album full of rich vocal harmonies.  The band musically reminds one of a stripped down Belle & Sebastian.  As mentioned, the vocal interplay on the album is very strong and has been compared to Crosby, Stills & Nash.  I wouldn't go that far in comparisons, but they are quite pretty nonetheless.  The only complaint is that many of the songs sound the same and kind of run into one another.  Other that, the band has a unique sound and I look forward to future offerings from the band.
0789318121|5.0|Having seen the film more times than I probably should, the necessity to purchase The Dark Knight Screenplay was not far off on the list of things I wanted after viewing the film.  Having placed over fifty pages of production art, make-up tests and still photos, topped with an excellant crime/drama of a story - only gives you more reason to buy what has already become such a landmark piece in the world of movies.

B001AUKUTU|1.0|First of all, I should state that I have a high IQ, do not smoke pot, do not worship Satan, don't drink, do not smoke and despise metal. Did I mention that I despise metal? The clientele of this band Dio seems to forget that for music to entertain us, it should be enjoyable and capable of being listened to. I was stuck in a Swedish hostel where some metal head losers put this on the CD/record player.<br /><br />Aggravating. Not only is it truly awful, it is unbearable, I guarantee any sane person who is forced to listen to this rubbish will want to jump out a window. The lead singer thinks he is the devil and has the corniest art covers including \\"secret messages\\" that angered fanatical Christians.<br /><br />Frankly, it's all very boring.

B001663RE8|4.0|Rocks hard, good songwriting, done right. At times a little uncomfortably harsh on women; don't listen to _all_ the words. Last half of the album is just as good as the first. Other reviewers heard the first album first. I don't have that one.
B00192KCQ0|5.0|Gettin back to what made me love this band in 1986. While this album will not compete with reign in blood or kill em all as the best thrash album ever, it does go back to epic songwriting and fast riffs and long lost guitar solos that made some call kirk one of the better guitar players out there. There is a new twist with iron maiden style guitar harmonies. I have been a metallica fan for a long time and can say that i am very satisfied with these new songs.
B000VNMMQG|5.0|This is a beautifully made movie, a great family movie who craves to know history and have real live heroes in a age of made-up ones.
B00005JPO1|5.0|I'm not gonna make a long review, nor am I gonna spoil anything in the movie, but Spielberg and Ford delivered. The style is very similar to the original (even though theres a 20 year gap) and the character of Jones is just as exciting as before. This 4th inclusion gives just what you'd expect, another great and fun time watching Indy fight the bad guys while trying to get the artifact before them.   This is a fun movie and it deserves more praise for its loyalty to the orignials. Seeing how many horrible remake there are today, this film is actually better than I expected.
0393324818|5.0|More than baseball, Moneyball is about questioning assumptions - challenging everything you know to be true about your situation and asking yourself if maybe it \\"ain't necessarily so.\\"  How did Billy Beane and the Oakland A's achieve so many wins with such a limited budget?<br /><br />1. They questioned assumptions (about the valuation of players).<br />2. They determined that various time-honored metrics metrics (for determining a player's value or worth) did not hold up under scrutiny.<br />3. Because no one ELSE did 1 and 2, they were able to invest their limited resources on players who were clearly undervalued.<br /><br />What happens when you question assumptions? You often arrive at winning solutions! Discussed in detail (along with other great examples) in:[[ASIN:0471742104 Shake That Brain: How to Create Winning Solutions and Have Fun While You're At It]]
B000T9OP7G|5.0|what i love about this show is they follow the storyline exactly.  they dont have things in the story that dont match with the movies.  It is a excellent story line and i love the show which means they'll   probably cancell the show. Everytime i love a show they cancell it. If   you havent checked out the show check it out. You will not be dissapointed  if you liked the Terminator movies.

B001AR0D4A|5.0|This is a great movie and BluRay Disc. The film is wonderful, an old throw back to when horror movies had subtext and ideas, using terrifying situations to comment on people and society. The black and white version is particularly creepy. The end does deviate from the book, but for my tastes it worked. Be forewarned, it is dark.<br /><br />If you're compiling a BluRay library, you can't go wrong with the Mist. It really is a showcase title.<br /><br />As for other less than positive reviews on this site, I understand personal tastes vary and respect that. But less than 1 star? That's not even in the right ballpark. The acting and effects were just right for the tone of the film. And if the end didn't work for you, it doesn't change that the rest of the movie was great.

B001DZLAWI|3.0|The songs on this album are the closest to pre Metallica Black that this band has produced in recent years.  They have definitely returned to their older form which is a good thing in my opinion.  I quit listening to this band after the \\"Load\\" album and am happy to see they have returned to their roots.  I am very unhappy with the sound quality of this LP.  There is a lot of clipping in many of the songs.  One reason I do not buy CD's is to avoid this \\"loudness\\" phenomenon.  I don't understand why the band allowed this poor quality to make it to the vinyl release.  The songs are great but I'm very unhappy with the quality of the mix, which is why I give it 3 stars.  I expect better on a vinyl LP.  There is really no point in buying the vinyl for this album as all of the clipping from the overly loud CD version is here.  Unfortunate ...  What happened to giving a darn about the quality of the sound?

1572814349|5.0|I purchased this tarot deck some time ago now, but that doesn't diminish the fact that I found Kat Black's Golden Tarot Deck to be visually stunning.  This is, by far, my personal favorite of the decks that I own.  Each individual card, in and of itself, is an artistic composition that offers a unique and insightful interpretation of the tarot.  The time invested by Ms. Black as she compiled the images used in her various collages was time well spent.  There is a certain feel, a warmth, that is consistant throughout the deck thus serving to unite the individuals into an entirely thought provoking presentation of the tarot.  I highly recommend this deck to anyone with preexisting knowledge and/or interest in the tarot.  And, anyone with an interest in fine art or art history would find this deck appealing as well.
B0010X745K|1.0|Thankfully, I checked this out from our local library branch - mostly because of the director - I was impressed by both Green Mile and Shankshaw Redemption.  This movie was so totally different from those two that I couldn't believe my eyes through most of this very ugly movie.  I kept thinking there had to be some \\"redemption\\" if I watched to the end...unfortunately, no - it got worse!  What a depressing movie with a totally tragic view of mankind.  The ending was just heartbreaking.  If you're feeling too happy, this will bring you down for sure!
B000GH3CVQ|5.0|When I thought about buying this album, I was torn between it and the soundtrack from the movie \\"Once\\".  I decided to get this because I felt like it would have more of an album feel.  That it does.  Listening to this album is like following the songwriters through a cohesive story of the character they created.  Every song is passionate/wonderful/beautiful.  Especially the Marketa Irglova instrumental(s).  The art in the liner notes is pretty cool, too.
1596680296|5.0|Before choosing to buy this book I checked out the reviews of similar books. I wanted a book for MY purposes and skill level.  Although I have been knitting a while, I had never knitted socks before and wanted to learn.      This book contains attractive photos, has a clean layout, has clearly-written chapters explaining sock anatomy, foot measurement, gauge charts, knitting instructions and suitable pattern stitches.  For those who can't always get specified yarns, this book allows you to substitute. Towards the back of the book are project socks that I myself wouldn't mind wearing or giving as gifts.    Since receiving this book Sept. 2(a gift from a friend who saw my wish list) I have made two pairs of basic socks that I've posted in my Ravelry project list.      If you're a sock newbie, this is definitely useful, practical, worth getting and keeping.
B00005JMFQ|5.0|This is one of the few chick-flicks I will watch (over and over again). I find it endearing, sad, heart braking, happy, funny, and a little bit confusing. I am not a huge fan of Hugh Grant, but I love him as the prime minister, looking up at the picture of Margaret Thatcher, painfully in love and utter something like this:<br /><br />\\"I bet you didn't have problems like these.  Of course you did, you saucy minx!\\"<br /><br />And who doesn't like his dancing in the hallways of Number 10, Downing Street?<br /><br />There is so much to love in this film, although it makes me cry, it also makes me feel so good inside. Definitely one of my favourite films of all time.

I know st. anger tried to bring it back but it did not happen. James hetfield singing is much inproved to which is a cool thing. The songs are really long and great to maybe heavy as and justice for all. Muss have this album right away.
B00192KCQ0|4.0|I think this new album Rocks.  It shows that Metallica is back.  It has great lyrics and great diversity.  The songs are intense, tecnical and longer.  The longest song is 8 min., except for the instrumental song,  \\"Suicide and Redemption\\", which is 10 min.  The first song, \\"That was just my life\\" starts out fast and continues. I also like, \\"All Nightmare Long\\", and Cyanide\\"  which both have a creative chorus lines.  I also like the tempo changes in \\"Cyanide\\".   The best song defintely is \\"Judas Kiss\\" it is fast and the timing is right on.  The guitar solo is great too.  The lyrics are cool too.  This has to be one of the best Metallica albums besides the black album.  I get hooked on the fast, moving and tempo changes of this album.    Thanks,  Jeff
B00192KCQ0|1.0|I've never been a huge Metallica fan, but I've loved some of their music from the early days on. I was actually looking forward to see if the band was going to resurrect what seems to have been a waning career over the past ten years. Unfortunately, the band comes off as a rather bad cliche' of themselves on this release. \\"That Was Just Your Life\\" starts off a little Dream Theaterish at first and got my attention for a moment, but it quickly settled back into I'm sure what is a comfortable place/sound for the band. \\"The End Of The Line\\" tips it's hat to Tool, but swiftly rehashes the Metallica formula and it continues through the rest of the recording. \\"The Day That Never Comes Before\\" sounds like someone put together a bit of all of Metallica's most popular songs and made a medley. \\"The Unforgiven III???\\" What's next, a recording of cover tunes? I think my biggest beef about this band is that I've never considered Lars Ulrich a good drummer (get a drum machine guys, there's kids all over YouTube tighter than LU). Here is a band that takes themselves far too seriously and at the expense of their fans (not to mention their pocketbooks, nice job Lars Simmons & James Stanley!). I think only the most dedicated and diehard Metallica fans will like this recording and it offers very little to anyone who might be listening to them for the first time. Dig out \\"Kill em' All\\" or \\"Master of Puppets\\" and listen to this band at the peak of their creativity. Too little, too late guys...sorry!
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Wow, I had no idea this existed when it came out. I am one of many that mourn the loss of it too soon even years later I am sure. A friend told me that it was on sale on Amazon and I bought it and loved it! Too bad that network execs are idiots.

I found Barack Obama's book to be well-written, insightful, and, as the title implies, hopeful. Obama recognizes the country's strengths and weaknesses, and has a vision about how to correct the problems we have. Some of the highlights of the book for me:    * How people begin to \\"speak like politicians\\"- since elected representatives have to rely on fundraising to get re-elected, and since that fund-raising comes from special interests, they are always having to watch their step to make sure they don't bother those who helped them get into office. In addition, with the modern media, every word an elected leader says is intensely scrutinized. So inevitably, once elected, people will measure their words very carefully, and begin to \\"speak like politicians.\\"    * His grasp of history. Obama correctly notes that America has some rather unpleasant traditions, including slavery and the \\"Native American issue\\" that do not fit well with the ideals set forth in the constitution. Nonetheless, he sees the constitution as something more than just one more contingency of history; rather, he rightly admires the  achievements of the constitution, such as the separation of powers, checks and balances, etc. I especially liked how he notes that one of the earliest founders, Alexander Hamilton, was a proponent of an energetic central government that promoted national development. In other words, not laissez-faire at all.     * Above all, his discussion of the issues. For example, with globalization, he recognizes it as a reality, but insists that it cannot occur at the expense of environmental and economic issues. \\"American can't compete with China and India simply by cutting costs and shrinking government- unless we're willing to tolerate a drastic decline in American living standards, with smog-choked cities and beggars lining the streets. Nor can America compete simply by erecting trade barriers and raising the minimum wage- unless wer're willing to confiscate all the world's computers.\\" Significantly, and related to the point about there being a tradition in America of using government to promote American interests, he writes that \\"The Ownership Society doesn't even try to spread the risks and rewards of the new economy among all Americans. Instead, it simply magnifies the uneven risks and rewards of today's winner-take-all economy\\"    It seems to me that Obama has a vision based on acknowledging rather than disregarding differences, and on the ability to see the world through other people's eyes. \\"No one is exempt from the call to find common ground.\\" As of this writing, it does not look like Obama's message is going to win, but I have not (yet) given up hope. If you want to understand the campaign and the issues, involved, please take the time to read this book, especially if heretofore you have been relying on reports in certain news networks and talk shows for your information on the man.
0757302661|1.0|I think the flaw with this method is the idea that something \\"natural\\" (ie childbirth) can't be painful. Childbirth sure seems painful...I've delivered a handful of babies myself. While I am looking forward to my first baby this Christmas, I am not anticipating a pain-free experience. I think the Mongan method has some valuable things to say regarding meditation and focus. However, it did not sell me on the efficacy of it's method.
031606792X|1.0|I've read this book 2x since it's come out, and I've given it a fair amount of time to resonate with me.  Despite Meyer's whole claim of the \\"Rob Effect\\" with regards to liking this book; time only made me dislike the book more than I did after I first read it.    Many of my issues with the book have already been discussed ad nauseum on here, so I'll just touch on the things that really bothered me personally.    First off, the editing. Was this book ever edited? (No, seriously...Was it?) I saw many references to \\"blonde\\" and \\"blond\\".  Pick one and stick to it.  Certainly \\"find/replace\\" was an option? I have Microsoft Word; and I would assume SMeyer or her publishers do as well(?)  And I won't even get started on the mechanics of the book.  Let's face it, Stephenie Meyer is a terrible writer.  She's admitted this fact herself.  She is a better storyteller (and I agree).  That said, with all the hype surrounding this book's release, *one would think* more effort would be put into handling the grammar/basics of it all.    Now, the story itself: First, I was hoping for some Team Edward/Team Jacob action. (I'm Team Edward). But it was almost immediate, then boom! They are married!  I was hoping for a little more conflict in the beginning. Another one of the things I took issue with is that SMeyer put a lot of thought into setting up the \\"vampire rules\\" in her prior books. Vamps can't have babies.  She said it, so of course it must be true!  So the whole Bella/pregnancy thing made me say \\"Are you kidding me?\\" (I realized I had officially lost it when I was rationalizing the possibility that vampires could exist, but certainly not reproduce.  But I digress..)  There were MANY other issues with consistency (Jazz? Rosalie and Bella = BFF?) that I had as well. My first thought after reading Breaking Dawn was \\"There is NO WAY Stephenie Meyer wrote this.  And if she did, I need to show some of my writing to her agent so I can score a book deal, because obviously ANYONE can publish books now.\\"  The pregnancy story line made me realized SMeyer had gone and jumped the shark.    The Imprinting.  Dear Lord.... the Imprinting.  Yes, I know it was addressed in Eclipse, but still.  When Bella got pregnant, I swear I saw that coming. I really was hoping Jacob would get with Leah, but as soon as Bella had a baby girl, I knew where that was headed.    The Birth. Again, did we need all the gory details? If SMeyer was sending a message to teens not to have sex or ELSE, it worked. I know I put off my baby making plans indefinitely after reading the birth scene.     Bella's transformation.  Now after investing in 3 books, I was hoping her transformation would be far more than a syringe of venom to the heart.  I wanted some seduction.  Heck, even \\"fade to black\\" seduction.  Her fans got gypped on that one.  I did not mind the fact that she became a supervamp.  I kind of expected that because she did have time to mentally prepare for her transformation, so that made sense in my mind.    Alice.  Where was Alice?  Alice was a huge part of the stories and I loved her.     The Anti-Climax.  Pretty much sums it up. I can't say more about that than was already said.    The characters.  I felt these characters were merely props in this book.  Up until BD, I was somewhat invested with these people.  Even Edward seemed to just be a marble statue.  There was no attachment to any of the characters.  Despite the fact that Twilight was out there- I did feel somewhat invovled with Bella and Edward.  I lost the connection I had with these characters in this book.    Renesmee.  Okay, my name IS RENEE and I would never, ever, ever, want it combined with another name.      A few other things on a side note...Something that makes me laugh is how people argue \\"She didn't go to college! What kind of message does that send to young girls!?\\"  Well, other than saying \\"Young girls shouldn't be getting life lessons from FICTIONAL BOOKS\\", I say \\"She's immortal. She's got plenty oftime to do college.\\"  Though it would have been nice to have an Epilogue from SMeyer telling us what she did.  And honestly, I had no problem with her marrying young.  I am speaking as 34 year old woman who went to college, has an undergrad degree and graduate work under her belt, and I've never married.  The reason I say this wasn't a big deal, again, is because she's IMMORTAL. I don't think the \\"typical\\" rules apply.  She has all the time in the world to do whatever she wants.    All in all, the story in itself seems very rushed; when I say rushed I mean rushed to be put together and published.  I hate comparing JKR to SMeyer (let's face it, there is NO comparison), but Harry Potter Book 7 \\"flowed\\" for me.  Everything made sense.  Sure, there were boring parts (camping, anyone?), but the pay off was big. Breaking Dawn had no pay off.  As others have mentioned, it read like fan fiction.  Sadly, I've read better fan fiction!  As far as the whole \\"Bella was a Mary Sue.\\"  I agree with that.  She didn't make any sacrifices. In Book 7 of HP, JKR took it to the next level.  She killed off characters many of us had loved (and not just for \\"body count\\" reasons). We knew as readers it was the right thing to do because that was the price that had to be paid. Because sometimes when we fight for what we want, and more importantly, for what is RIGHT, we have to sacrifice the things we love.    To sum it all up (finally), I say this:  If you've invested any time into the Twilight series, you should read the last book and find out how the story ends.  Draw your own conclusions and feel how you want.  Some people love this book, some people hate it.  I walk away from this book saying \\"Twilight\\" was a trilogy (a fact that some Twihards find extremely offensive, but oh well), and SMeyer as an author should never be even ranked near JKR. (And pathetically enough, I am still holding out hope we've all been PUNK'D and the real book will be out around Christmas.)    ***EDIT:  If you want to read a hilarious, clever, chapter by chapter break down of the Breaking Dawn novel(and the Twilight series), check out this site: [...] Please note- you must have a sense of humor to enjoy. It made it worth reading Breaking Dawn.

B00192KCQ0|5.0|Perfect come back. Their best works since black album.They wasted their years with load/re-load/st.anger.    All songs classic and old metallica sound. There is not new thing at sound. But, long songs is not boring.    If you metallica fun you must been buy it. Buy it, never regret.    I rate it;       The End of the Line: There's some cool riffs on here and the chorus works but the clean interlude later really kills the momentum and really the song could've ended there but it drags the song. 8/10     Broken, Beaten and Scarred: A pretty cool intro starts off the song and while the structure is a bit repetitive, it's still a pretty cool song and I love the chorus. 9/10     The Day That Never Comes: First single.This song liking to \\" nothing else matter\\" . 6/10     All Nightmare Long:  this song has probably the best chorus on the entire album.  9/10     Cyanide: Some supremely catchy riffs and an awesome chunky chorus and though the clean/distortion switching section I could do without, I love listening to this one. 9.5/10     The Unforgiven III: It's quite good and the piano/trumpet intro is great though some might not get it. 6.5/10     The Judas Kiss: Best song of album my mind. 10/10     Suicide and Redemption: Superrr 9.5/10     My Apocalypse: Rather than a big epic closer, we have a speedier thrash song and this is another great one with some particularly brutal riffs and sure to give guitar players a workout and it's actually got pretty good drumming from Lars who's been kind of unsurprising on the album. Great ending song. 10/10

B00005NKKZ|4.0|Bridge over Troubled Water is just one of those albums that just feels so damn complete.  One after another, this album boasts quite some variety, especiallly considering that this album is folk based.  Folk based just has that natural, organic sound, and variety in that is just great.  Nick Drake knew that, and it seems that Simon And Garfunkel know that as well.  Plus, the music on this record is just dang good, period.  Not just an acoustic guitar and a guy moaning, there is a variety of sounds in this record, and it can be very melodic.  Yeah, it is catchy, but more than catchy.  The melodies draw you in to Paul's Simon's pretty cool lyrics (not lyrical rocket science, but they get the job done).<br /><br />The song Bridge Over Troubled Water, with it's epic piano and lush arrangements, has a great message about putting your life and helping those who are going through a tough time.  I love the middle of it, with it's poudning, makes me think of a water show (huh?).  El Condor Pasa, brings to mind an enchanted forest, not in a cheesy way, with it's percussion and flute, and lyrics about he's \\"rather be a hammer than a nail\\".  After these kind of slow songs, Cecilia and Keep The Customers Sastisfyed brighten the mood with their upbeat sound.  We get enough to keep us from falling asleep, until we get to the tribute by Simon to Garfunkel, So Long Frank Loyd Wright.  The Boxer, tells about immigration  in the first two verses (I have no idea what the third is) with a melancholy feel and that orchestra \\"Boom!\\".  Baby Driver, once again, brings us back to jumping, and this song has no meaning, really, but it still is a keeper.<br /><br />Alright, so the album fails a hair to live up to the tracks, but it still churns out great music.  The Only Boy Living In New York is highly underrated, another song written For Garfunkel.  Why Don't You Write Me, is kind of upbeat, and the guitars sing and breathe.  Bye Bye Love isn't a very happy song, but a very sad message.  IT's a bit immature and it would pretty much bug the crap out of me if I heard someone complain using the phrases.  Besides, it actually has it's catharis, it makes you feel a bit  better.  Song For The Asking ends the album.  Sure, it's not that great of a song, but it's short and winds you down.  Of course, the remaster is great, and the bonus tracks are probably a good addition, but their are bonus tracks.<br /><br />A great album.  While not quite the greatest thing I've ever heard, and not exactly worth five stars, it's worth it.  Organic music is what you need in life.<br /><br />8.5/10e and it would pretty much bug the crap out of me if I heard someone complain using the phrases.

B000NDIAWY|4.0|While watching the Olympics from China, I kept hearing one song over and over again; in the backgraoud of an auto commercial.  Every time it played I found myself asking, \\"Who is that?\\"  Determined to find out, I went to Amazon and tried to find \\"I was meant for you,\\" which I hoped was the title of the song.  Somehow, even though the song is actually \\"The Story,\\" up popped Brandi Carlile.  I ordered the album, and was not disappointed.  It is beautifully produced and performed.  All the songs are interesting and unique.  I still love \\"The Story,\\" but \\"My Song\\" has become my favorite.  This is a great new, (to me anyway,) talent; and the album one of my absolute favorites.
B000X5SPBI|3.0|Don't get me wrong. I'm a huge fan of Supernatural and I find no end to the enjoyment watching these two guys act. Especially Jensen Ackles...I swear he puts so much into his role that I find myself getting irritated at his brother character for being such an insufferable pussy. I tend to agree with his brother about what a big GIRL he is.    I found the previous two seasons incredibly engaging in terms of story and continuity. I was a little worried when Kripke inserted the Road House into the mix; I'm very glad he realized how ridiculous it was and gleefully burned it to the ground and killed most of the hunters within it.     But with Season 3, I got an overwhelming sense of that the show is once again slipping into what appears to be a mockery of Heroes or a lame new X-Men movie. Cmon, the 7 Deadly Sins? Lillith? (Which should be Lilith; someone didn't do much research) Give us a break, okay? It's about as hokey as it gets without becoming another Buffy series. Please do us a favor and go back to the drawing board and look at what made us cheer in triumph at the last two seasons.     One improvement Season 3 that DID impress me were the entirely new and cool special effects. Like that scene with the two ghosts running into each other and exploding as water? Exquisite. But I also noted that this season lacks the \\"stand-alone\\" strength in its stories. This season is also exponentially darker, and I worry about the life of the show if they push it too far. You're approaching Kill Bill territory, and that's not a good thing.    Once again, I love the series, as I own all three seasons now. But I'm also hopeful that Mr. Kripke will hear us out and continue to deliver us the excitement and mystique of the show that we've grown to know and love in the seasons to come.
B000EQ47GS|5.0|This album could almost be thought of as the soundtrack to America's Bicentennial, not coincidently in that it was released that same year. Any pop cultural review of 1976 would be incomplete without a mention of this powerful, stunning (and even patriotic-feeling!) musical debut from Tom Scholz, Brad Delp, Barry Goudreau, Fran Sheean, and Sib Hashian ---- the boys from Bean-Town.<br /><br />Every song on here is a classic and this remasterd version of the original album sounds better than ever. Like the opening track, this whole collection of songs really is 'more than a feeling', it's a state of mind that listening to the cd takes you to. It's a natural mood lifter for me ; energizing, optimistic and purist in nature. I consider this debut by Boston to be the quintessential classic rock album of 1976.<br /><br />The fact that Boston aren't as respected in the world of music as they should be may be borderline criminal, but don't make the mistake of ignoring or disregarding the impact they've had on music. After this debut, virtually ever heavy metal band that followed in the 80's copied some variation of the drums and percussion style that Boston originally designed and patented. Plus, Boston are musical pioneers and there's no doubt many of the young rock bands and musicians on the scene today owe their very existence as artists to Boston.<br /><br />Besides, how many other bands out there can actually boast a graduate of M.I.T. in their lineup? Yes, that's right, Tom Scholz is a musical genius in the true sense of the word. He designed the first-ever, one-of-a-kind equipment used on this album's recording.<br /><br />So take note, modern musicians and critics everywhere : even if you don't like Boston, show them the respect they deserve.

B00192KCQ0|1.0|people blame the quility of the music on mixing and production and all that technical stuff. in my opinion this album is garbage because metallica doesnt know how to structure a song anymore. lars cant play the drums for his life and james is too old and trys too hard to sing. it seems like metallica took a bunch of riffs threw them in a hat and randomly placed them in 75minutes of lameness called it death magnetic and released it. do yourself a favor and stick with anything from kill em all to the black album because throwing a bunch of riffs together adding crappy vocals and annoying drums does not make a good album.

B00192KCQ0|5.0|I have been a fan since I first heard Ride The Lightning. These guys invented the modern heavy sound. Sure there were bands like Diamond Head, Mercyful Fate, and whole slew of european acts. These guys brought the world to heavy metal in the 80's.  There first 3 albums were a definition and blueprint if what modern what just about every metal band is doing now.  This cd is good. Its a throwback to many years ago. This is what should have came out after \\"...And Justice for all\\".  This is a definate step forward for them. I hate seeing all the bashers come out and slam this CD. People are so jaded on comparing this to all the really alternative metal that is out there. People mature as musicians over time. That is human nature. EVERY band will change with time. Pick any band and in 20+ years you will see them change ( if they survive at all).  This is a really good. I was one of the harshest critics after \\"St Anger\\". I will take back the idea they are done. Not even close.   These guys are one of the most influential bands of our time. They are definately mt generations version of Led Zepplin.  Do yourself a favor and have an open mind with this one and you will be surprised.

B00192KCQ0|5.0|For what it is, this album is epic. Metallica decides to return to form here, for what reason I do not know. But it initially sounds like they went back into the vaults and listened to their old material and decided to mimic it. The ideas are fresh, solid, controlled, and well written. The music is intense and raw, without being chaotic. This album honestly sounds like it should have been released in 1989, between And Justice For All and The Black Album. Yeah, it's not their best album by any means, but you can't deny that it's a breath of fresh air. It makes me proud to be a Metallica fan again, and for anyone who respects Load and ReLoad, then this album is really for you. It blows the albums out of the water...Check it out.

This is a very happy, feel-good movie, and the soundtrack is the same! It boosts me up and makes me smile; I listen through the whole CD at least once a week!  Oh, just a little thing: not all the songs are included, like \\"Chiquitita\\", \\"I do, I do, I do\\", \\"Waterloo\\" (from the end credits), and like 2 others that aren't really sung completely in the movie.

B0014I4KIK|5.0|Simply tremendous talent and a very addictive sound.  Along with Adele's \\"19\\", this album has been in heavy rotation for me for months, and the more the listen to it, the more I LOVE it.  At first I was attracted to just a handful of songs (\\"Rockferry\\", \\"Warwick Avenue\\", \\"Syrup and Honey\\" and the radio-ready hit \\"Mercy\\"), but now I love about 90% of the songs.  While most of the songs discuss heartbreak and breaking up, each song has a distinct personality that speaks to Duffy's versatility.  \\"Rockferry\\" starts out quietly and builds to this tremendous fervor that takes your breath away.  \\"Syrup and Honey\\" is one of the sexiest stripped-down blues songs I've ever heard.  \\"Serious\\" sounds like a '60s poppy girl band song, but has a great feminist message (as does \\"Stepping Stone\\").   I only wish there were more songs on the album so it would last longer.  Hopefully she puts out another album soon!

B00192KCQ0|5.0|This was about to be a two word review: \\"Holy Sh..!!!\\" but I guess I should add more to that.  Metallica has come full circle with Death Magnetic.  I like all eras of Metallica(have been a diehard fan since 1986) but I think they are on the right track this time.  Having Rob Trujillo in the band, dropping Bob Rock and working with Rick Rubin and getting in touch with their inner metalhead seems to have done the trick.  Lars Ulrich is doing the most amazing drumming I've heard in years on this new CD.  Bob Rock is a great producer but they really hit a brickwall with St. Anger.  Even though I like that CD, it was fun but messy and was a bit of a left turn for them to say the least and the lyrics seemed a bit weak at times.  I don't understand all the negative talk of everything 90's Metallica.  There are some hidden gems during that era(\\"Carpe Diem Baby\\" deserves more attention in my view - Hetfield even has a tattoo of it on his arm) so I hesitate to call this the big comeback or their best album since \\"...And Justice for All\\".  It's almost impossible for this band to put out a truly horrendous album but St. Anger was the closest they ever came to that(again, I like that album!).<br /><br />I think the band finally realised that they should give the fans what they really want to hear: No BS METAL without the country tinges of \\"Mama Said\\" or \\"Low Man's Lyric\\" and without the truly lame lyrics of something like \\"Invisible Kid\\"(and most of St. Anger) or the ZZ Top-like \\"Ronnie\\" from Load.  The one true oddity of this new CD is \\"The Unforgiven III' which, although a good tune, doesn't seem to fit lyrically with the previous Unforgiven songs.  So the abused kid described in the first two songs grew up to be a murderer('She'll be there when I'm gone/DEAD sure she'll be there' in U-II) to sailing a ship looking for Gold? I don't get it.  All of a sudden he's on Gilligan's island.  They could have easily called the song something else and that way we wouldn't be comparing it to Unforgiven I & II because part III stands on it's own.  If they are going to do sequels, I vote for Blackened II or Orion II.  \\"The Judas Kiss\\" has perhaps the weirdest solo I've ever heard from the band - a weird bendy melody line that repeats.  I got chills.  I predict that song will make it's way into their concerts in the future.  The constant hammering riff(NOT hammer-on, that's something different) near the end of \\"All Nightmare Long\\" also will make you take notice.  \\"The Day That Never Comes\\" has a few slight echoes of \\"One\\" in the speedy parts.  All in all, a great album.  They are back on track.  Let's hope it last.  Maybe they should work with Rick Rubin from now on like Slayer has mostly done in their career that way you know what you are getting - a great album from a great legendary metal band.

B0018O4YSQ|5.0|The Good Things  *The Blu-Ray has excellent video quality; easily one of the best transfers ever.  The movie is much more colorful than I remember.  Very clear, crisp picture.  No grain.  Even though most of the movie is dark, it looks phenomenally great.  The sound quality is great too.  *Includes both the theatrical cut and director's cut of the movie.  Also has a bunch of special features, some of which came from the older DVD release (essays and notes), and others that are brand new (documentaries, new commentaries, and some other stuff).  All of this is on disc one; disc two is a digital copy.  *The movie itself has some good action and special effects.  Moreover, it has a very slick and interesting tech-noir style and production design (overall, it's like a retro version of \\"Blade Runner\\").  *The story is interesting.  It didn't make total sense when I first saw it years ago, but repeated viewings make things clearer.  *Characters are not bad.  Has a good cast.  *Pretty good writing; some memorable lines.    The Bad Things  *As said above, storyline may be hard to get on first viewing.  *Kind of slow at parts (but if you like the style, it'll be interesting all the way through).    The movie was a pleseant surprise when I saw its former DVD release years ago; it was stylish and had some great action and special effects (especially during the movie's finale).  Repeated viewings have been even more interesting.  The Blu-Ray is most worthwhile, for both its video quality and its array of special features.  Definitely reccomended to sci-fi fans.
B00192KCQ0|5.0|Despite the vile that tends to be thrown their way, I rather liked the Load/Reload albums and appreciate them more when I see them as rock albums rather than metal. Sure there was a couple clunkers but it had some great, career-best songs like Outlaw Torn and it had some of Hetfield's best vocals he ever laid down. But I will agree St. Anger was bad on all fronts with awful production and songs that seemed to be long just for the sake of it so then we have the dreaded follow-up and turns out it's actually more in line with the first 4 albums and while this album probably won't be as treasured as those, the fact this album is good in its own right and sounds along the lines of those 4 is quite a welcome.    This Was Just Your Life: Starts out with some eerie clean guitar tones before it adds heavier chords and the song turns into a big thrash number. While personally it's got shades of Blackened, it's a great way to start the album. And also unlike some songs, I actually don't mind its length. 9/10    The End of the Line: It's more groove-based with some heavier flourishes and there's some cool riffs on here and the chorus works but the clean interlude later really kills the momentum and really the song could've ended there but it drags the song. 7/10    Broken, Beaten and Scarred: A pretty cool intro starts off the song and while the structure is a bit repetitive, it's still a pretty cool song and I love the chorus. While it's not really one of the album's best ones, it's certainly one of the better ones still. 8/10    The Day That Never Comes: Obviously it's more accessible, hence why it's likely chosen as the first single. And while the instrumental section that takes up nearly half the song is flat-out awesome, it's the actual \\"song\\" part that kind of lacks. Hetfield's vocals, Lars' drum sound and a feeling of blase make it start meh but end great. 7/10    All Nightmare Long: I'll say it here: this song has probably the best chorus on the entire album. With somecool, heavy riffs, a cool solo and quite a few changes, it's not my outright favorite, it's a great song and would be a killer in concert. 8/10    Cyanide: Many people's first exposure to the album was this song performed live and the album version works just as well. Some supremely catchy riffs and an awesome chunky chorus and though the clean/distortion switching section I could do without, I love listening to this one. 8.5/10    The Unforgiven III: While many would question the need for a third (be glad it's not a Fade to Black sequel), the song's actually pretty good which follows the first's idea of having heavy verses and more quiet choruses with some pretty good singing by Hetfield but  then that solo hits and it's like...wow. It's quite good and the piano/trumpet intro is great though some might not get it. 7.5/10    The Judas Kiss: It's funny how so many people love this song but personally I could never really get into it even after several listens. The riffs are fine but it kind of just lurches on and the chorus is decent enough but it's one of those kind of things where I've heard better. 6.5/10    Suicide and Redemption: Just in case you didn't get the return-to-form feeling with the record, we have the first instrumental they've done since 1988's \\"To Live is to Die\\". And while Call of Ktulu is still my all-time favorite, I quite enjoy this one and never really felt it just dragged which is surprising considering it's 2 seconds shy from 10 minutes. 8.5/10    My Apocalypse: Rather than a big epic closer, we have a speedier thrash song and this is another great one with some particularly brutal riffs and sure to give guitar players a workout and it's actually got pretty good drumming from Lars who's been kind of unsurprising on the album. Great ending song. 8.5/10    There's an unfair expectation that people have with bands now where they've got to deliver a whopper of an album for it to even compete in the same league as their best. The songs are quite fun, there's catchy hooks, blazing solos and harmonized leads are back and they sound almost refreshed and focused, unlike St. Anger. Even if it's not a perfect bullseye, at least they're back on the right path.
B000V86OKG|5.0|I am so glad I preordered this set from Amazon.<br />This second season is great! I love the characters,the acting is top notch!<br />The plot has taken off on its own and it doesn't follow the book but it doesn't matter cause Dexter is still dark and my favorite serial killer!<br />Enjoy!

6302424887|3.0|Will's play is pretty good.  Polanski's film, not so much.  Yep, the Scottish play was meant to be a dark one, and Polanski gives us lots of glowering skies, but I just didn't feel much depth of character in this rendering.  I'd love to see what Zefferelli would do with Macbeth... or the Cohen brothers....
031606792X|5.0|THis is the last book of the twilight saga and is as wondeful as the other 3, my personal favorite part of the book is the book 2 narrated by the character Jacob, is sboslutly funny,you laught and laught at the same time you feel fear, love, pationt, scare, the complet saga is the best series of book for female youngh adults, i just love it
1416562591|4.0|At some point the main character Balram Halwai recounts a story about the Buddha in which a Brahmin tries to trick the Buddha by asking him if he considers himself man or god. The Buddha answered saying \\"Neither. I am just one who has woken up while the rest of you are still sleeping.\\" (270) Balram Halwai has certainly woken up in this story, in which he moves from a boy who broke coal in a tea shop to a driver and servant to a wealthy family, and then to self-made \\"entrepreneur.\\" How he did it and why is the stuff of this book, which describes his awakening into the realities of the various levels of Indian society, and his understanding of the system that keeps servants in their place. His conclusion is that within the span of a couple of decades, the white men will no longer have a place in India, but at the same time, the system will continue to remain the same, due to the corruption and injustice that is so embedded within.    An easy but intense read, I would definitely recommend it to anyone interested in India and its politics, social system and beliefs. It's interesting to watch Balram and his metamorphosis, although I can't say I could entirely sympathize with him throughout the story. Funny that, because I tend to like books where the underdog has his day, but this time I just didn't think that the costs were worth it. Although I suppose in some sense that to him, or to others in his predicament, they were.    Overall, a very good novel. I'm happy it made it to the Booker shortlist.
B000002B5L|5.0|altough this album is old school its definetly a blue print that many should follow what I like about the album is a rare mix of reggea,hip-hop  rap and r&b and half the album were major hits wish anyone would bring back the taste of the rufugee camp and many say the sly & robbie mix was akon first song well all I hope you enjoy this album it is a must have if you dont have it.
B00028HBKC|2.0|There's not much that hasn't already been said here, but basically this is a horror film (or Torture Porn for the \\"Saw\\"/\\"Hostel\\" crowd) that happens to be based on the Bible rather than any other book.  If this film were based on historical evidence, no one would have even cared when this film came out and it would have just been a very violent Roman film similar to \\"300.\\"      Instead, the film is based on one man's (Gibson) interpretation of the Bible, so it's allowed to throw facts out the window (the location of the wounds, nudity, etc. - it's all been said by hundreds of other people) and just show crazy amounts of carnage and brutality and disturbing visuals.  It's fortunate the soundtrack is brilliant, the cinematography is masterful, and Jim Caviezel gives an amazing performance, otherwise this might come across as \\"Saw XIV: Mel Gibson Kills Jesus.\\"
B0010358CQ|3.0|Visually it is great but that is the best thing about it. The story drags along at times....fight scenes are decent. Nothing new here...Vexille is a far better watch.
0743290119|1.0|I have a rule learned through many painful experiences that I never by the next novel following a blockbuster in hardback. But I loved 'The Devil Wears Prada\\" and I bought this in hardback  anyway. And boy was I sorry. This book is terrible. The characters are vapid and stupid. I didn't like any of them. Adriana is the most annoying character I have encountered in a long time. Her habit of saying \\"querida\\" every sentence set my teeth on edge.   Don't waste your money.
B000002G89|5.0|I thought Clapton's work during the '70s couldn't get any better than Derek and the Dominoes, but I was wrong. 461 Ocean Blvd. is a great mix of traditional blues like Robert Johnson's \\"Steady Rollin' Man\\" and the opening track, \\"Motherless Children\\" is a beautiful collage of distorted blues guitars(George Terry with Clapton). \\"Motherless Children\\" should be played on classic rock stations alot more than it is.    The album also features Clapton's hits like \\"I Shot the Sheriff\\" and \\"Let It Grow\\" but it dips into unknown funky tracks like \\"Get Ready\\" and \\"I Can't Hold Out\\". It's acoustic leanings on \\"Give Me Strength\\" and \\"Please Be With Me\\" are great to listen to because you get to hear Clapton alone on guitar, probably where his blues roots began.
B000URDEB0|5.0|I heard these guys on a college radio station and was floored, so I bought the album. I play a few instruments, not particularly well, but well enough to know that NW's arrangements were completely nuts for a metal band.    I wasn't disappointed when I bought the album. The first track \\"The Poet and the Pendulum\\" is worth the price of the album even if all the other songs were terrible. Fortunately though, they're not. \\"Amaranth\\" is an amazing standout too. There honestly isn't a song on this album that's bad, and there are two that I'd consider truly great.    This is kind of a weird album because the writer is clearly influenced as much, if not more, by movie soundtracks than heavy metal. He's really good at arrangements (the musicianship here is on par with Dream Theater and most Broadway stuff). Production is also some of the best I've heard since some of the classic Iron Maiden albums (high quality, but not overproduced). Oh, and whatever the controversy is over the lead singer, I can tell you she has a great set of pipes that fits this music well.    Only 2 downsides to the album (and they're minor). The guy who sings backup sometimes is pretty bad, especially compared to their lead singer. Also, the lyrics are written by a guy who's read too much LOTR and alternate between typical power metal stupidity and bitterness over his ex-bandmate or ex-gf or something (though it doesn't reach the laughably stupid heights goth music so readily ascends). Minor quibbles, though.    If you play music, or listen to classical music, movie soundtracks, or heavy metal, work in musical theater (this kind of music really would carry over into that) or just really like music - you owe it to yourself to buy this album. Very highly recommended.
B00168HARG|5.0|As a huge Terminator fan, I really enjoy this series!  The script and acting is as good as anything on TV currently and recently.  I never thought I would enjoy watching the kid from 90210, but he's an excellent Derek Reese.  Lena Headey does a great job as well, but I think the paramedic's wife looks more like Linda Hamilton and may have been a better choice as Sarah Connor.    The show stays faithful to the plot and story line of T1 and T2 (the events of T3 have not happened yet), and it will be interesting to see if some of these characters will be in or referenced in T4.    As far as the quality of the blu-ray, it is equal or better than the HD version on TV.  It's not reference quality, but it is an excellent presentation.    This is great entertainment and any Terminator fan will enjoy it.  I hope they continue the series to a season 3.
B000002552|5.0|Okay, a lot of this material has seen official release, and it's not likely to get re-packaged or augmented any time soon, so here's whatcha gotta do: download this from someplace legal (like here) so Bob will get his money (give him a string bean -- he's a hungry man!). Actually, just download these: Odds And Ends, Million Dollar Bash, Goin' To Acapulco, Lo And Behold!, Clothes Line Saga, Apple Suckling Tree, Please Mrs. Henry, Tears Of Rage, Too Much Of Nothing, Yea! Heavy And A Bottle Of Bread, Crash on The Levee, Tiny Montgomery, You Ain't Goin' Nowhere, Nothing Was Delivered, Open the Door Homer and This Wheel's On Fire.     Then get Quinn the Eskimo from Biograph. The Bootleg Series 1-3 has Santa Fe and I Shall Be Released. I'm Not There is on the soundtrack album of the same name. You now have twenty tracks with a running time of about 62 minutes. Burn it. The result gets five stars. This is the album that goes between Blonde On Blonde and John Wesley Harding on your Dylan shelf and in the artistic chronology. Yeah, it's rough (it's a home recording), but it's real. In lieu of a new package, cut out a picture of Bob and slide it into the jewel case. Tell him I said it was alright.
B00192KCQ0|5.0|Best album since Justice, very clean complex metal with many time changes, a lot of bands wouldn't be able to pull this off live......
B00192KCQ0|2.0|Sounded like they were trying to re-find the sound from Justice, but it falls short. The songs lack a cohesiveness, the choruses don't catch and the solo's sound like old Hammett, but that's the thing it sounds old. Metal has moved on and they're trying to pick up at 1990 again. This'll album will thrill you if you still have your jean jacket with patches.
B000000XB9|4.0|Anyone out there know if CCR have a live dvd out.....love to see them live in concert...........Eps
B00192KCQ0|4.0|Mostly excellent tunes...Cyanide and My Apocalypse are instant classics.  While Suicide and Redemption is good it's way too long for an instrumental.  As a whole I listen to the album straight through skipping in the middle of maybe two songs.  If you're a Metallica fan you'll enjoy this.
B001BGTWXI|3.0|I've liked some of Slipknot's stuff.  They have some awesome drumming that pounds your face off!  All the instruments come through clear and sound f-ing awesome!  But the actual music doesn't hold much interest for me, I get rather bored with the album, which for me was its downfall.  I would like to give the 3.5 stars, but Amazon in their infinite wisdom won't let us die hard raters do that.  All Hope Isn't Gone on this album, but it won't be going nonstop in your MP3 player either.

B0015519VS|3.0|I THINK THIS ALBUM WAS A LITTLE DISAPPOINTING........I BOUGHT THE ALBUM WITHOUT EVEN LISTENING TO THE 30 SECOND SAMPLE ( WHICH I NEVER DO) BUT BECAUSE IT WAS USHER I JUST KNEW IT WAS GOING TO BE HOT!! WRONG!!! I WAS SO MAD AFTER HEARING THE FIRST 5 SONGS THAT I NEVER LISTENED TO IT AGAIN UNTIL WEEKS LATER...ONLY BECAUSE I HAD NOTHING ELSE TO LISTEN TO!!!! NOW THE CD IS OK.. BUT IF I WOULD HAVE HEARD IT BEFORE I BOUGHT, I WOULD STILL HAVE MY 9.99 IN MY POCKET!!! NOW DONT GET ME WRONG THERE ARE A COUPLE REALLY GOOD SONGS ON THERE BUT OVERALL THE CD WASNT GOOD FOR A PERSON ON HIS STATUS!!! HE SHOULD HAVE RETIRED AFTER CONFESSIONS!!!!!!! WHILE STILL ON TOP!!!!
B0015HOFZI|4.0|Some reviewers have commented on the \\"plasticky\\" appearance of this unit. No doubt, it isn't the kind of equipment you would have expected to be sitting next to an expensive amp, receiver and huge speakers twenty years ago, but it doesn't serve the same purpose.<br /><br />The way I look at it, once I have copied my 100 or so LPs to a hard drive, I'll just put this puppy on eBay and get most of my money back. Frankly, for what I spent on it, I could throw it in the trash and come out ahead b/c I didn't have to go out and replace my (some irreplaceable) vinyl with CDs.<br /><br />Let's make it plain, however, that converting your LPs to digital (even with the pretty good scratch removing software included) won't render the clean, clear quality of the identical recording which was later released on CD. In other words, this USB player works just fine and the software will allow you to disguise the defects of your old, used records somewhat, but it isn't going to make them new or even come close to a new CD. As for the reasons, lets just say that so much new recording technology has come down the road since you bought your old records that they didn't sound as good as you thought they did when they were brand new.<br /><br />Now that we're over those few hurdles, let's talk about the turntable and software. The TT will play 33s and 45s, but not 78s. Well, really - do you care? Maybe. I have about as many 78s as LPs. My wife has a slew of 45s. So, yeah, it might be an issue.<br /><br />The TT works just fine with as little \\"wow\\" as you used to have on much more expensive units. The stylus seems to be up to the task, also. The software can be a little daunting at first, unless you have already played with similar apps. Actually, once you get over the hump, it's pretty much a matter of play and record. You'll probably just stick with one scratch removal setting and copy all of your records w/o changing it.<br /><br />This unit does have a switch which allows you to turn on or off the preamp, which is handy if you decide to use it as a part of your home entertainment system instead of putting it on eBay.<br /><br />Incidentally, my unit is hooked up to an XP equipped Dell laptop. Like others, I was surprised and disappointed to discover that I could not monitor the sound through the laptop's speakers while it was being recorded. Other than that, getting it set up and operational was fairly easy (but I do have a background with computers and A/V stuff).<br /><br />I recently had the opportunity to set up another brand of unit for a friend. It had a few more features, such as a fancier mechanism for dropping the stylus on a track in the middle of the record and it would play records backwards(!?) But, it cost more money.<br /><br />The Sony works well enough that I recommended it (and Amazon, too) to an older friend. She immediately purchased it, but I'm pretty sure her techno savvy son had to set it up for her!u decide to use it as a part of your home entertainment system instead of putting it on eBay.

B000OCXFCO|3.0|This album should have been called The System Has Failed 2. It is almost the same sounding album as United Abominations. But thats ok compared to Risk and Cryptic Writings. This is a good string of albums since The world needs a hero.
B00192KCQ0|5.0|This is probably the best metal record to come out in the past 15 years.  I have to admit that I don't listen to much metal any longer due to nu-metal.  This record pounds and I'm hoping that it will have a ripple effect and crush all the nu-metal and wanna-be shred metal bands out there.    The ability to keep it fresh while still paying homage to the sound that made them the kings of metal deserves to be respected.
B00192KCQ0|4.0|First off this is a good album, it reminds me of St. Anger but with more melody and polished production. This is their best since Justice album. I dont think they are tring to rekindle their old sound just trying yet new sound and direction. My fav tracks are The day that never comes, Cyanide and My apocalypse. I recommend this album if you want to give Metallica a second chance.
B00192KCQ0|5.0|I'd say I'm a second round metallica fan from hearing the black album a few after it came out when I was around 10 and being totally wowed by what I heard.  After that I was hooked and eagerly awaited their next release which was load.  When that came out despite the different sound I felt so lucky to experience a new metallica release.  Now with the release of the Death Magnetic I can say it's absolutely amazing to hear such a awesome album from beginning to end. Not one bad song, no pointless fillers, just plain original rock/metal.  Great new music that will sure provide some new metallica fans with the magic of the experience of a new album.  Metallica is definitely the band of our time no matter what music your into and they continue to prove their the best at what they do.
B001FEA9QU|2.0|I have bought several MP3 albums through Amazon and they all sound top notch...until now. For some reason, the MP3 version of Death Magnetic through Amazon is really bad. It sounds as if you're listening to it though speakers that are being driven too hard, but it sounds this way on any speakers at any volume. At first I feared that was the actual mix of the album until I borrowed my friends CD which sounds great.     Buy Death Magnetic, but don't get the MP3 version though Amazon unless they correct the sound quality.
0316067601|5.0|This should be required reading in our high schools.  This is an amazing story told by a very humble man.  Just read it.
0140557741|5.0|Just flip the pages slowly - forwards and at times, back again. You're in for a good surprise-one after another. Enjoy!
B001BE0MFM|4.0|So having had this vinyl for awhile now and listened to the vinyl...I am impressed, but not overly so. The sound is, indeed, warmer and the instruments stand out much better than the CD. Those wanting the overly done bass should stick with the CD for sure. I don't mean this in a bad thing. But from my comparison while having the CD play and the LP playing the same tracks and flipping back and forth between phono and CD, surprisingly the CD's bass is thicker, but almost TOO thick. It comes across too boomy and you almost lose depth to the music if that makes sense. The LP maintains that bass as if it were a concert and you FELT it rather than feeling like your head is going to explode. It's definitely mastered differently so that's a plus. I would only recommend this vinyl for those who are highly sensative to noticing these types of differences though.  As this isn't as super obvious as some LP's are compared to their CD offspring.
B0019FOC5E|5.0|I well remember the 80s in my friend Annemiek's house, bopping about to Abba's hits and singing as we went.  Went and saw the movie a bit ago, which was so excellent, the whole family bopping their way about the cinema, with laughter, tears and music. A fabulous cast, clever story, and Funny!  Naturally, we've listened to nothing else since.  Only regret: some tracks from the film are missing, as always, plus it is studio recorded, so you don't get the emotion from the movie; the jokes within songs; the spoken parts. Example, in 'Take a Chance on Me' the words start off being spoken in the film and go into song slowly and gradually, whereas onthe CD that is left out.  Apart from that:  Love it, love it, love it.  Great music!  Great memories, old and new.
B0013FYTA8|1.0|I dare anyone to listen to TOAD's \\"Bad Girlfriend\\" and The Cult's \\"Fire Woman\\" and tell me that's not a rip-off. I hope The Cult takes TOAD to the cleaners.
B000002H97|5.0|This is a great album, one of Metallica's best, and it boggles my mind (and others) why fans constantly talk about this one as a blatant sellout.  If Metallica had started doing duets with Brittney Spears, added drum machines for Lars's drumming, added a cheesy keyboardist who used to play for A Flock of Seagulls, and had some members of Poison join the band, then it would be a sellout.  This isn't.<br /><br />This album is chock full of brilliant Metallica classics.  From one of their greatest singles ever in Enter Sandman to other brilliant classics like Whenever I May Roam, The Unforgiven (even though I prefer The Unforgiven II), and Nothing Else Matters, this album is just as good as anything Lars, James, Kirk, or Jason put out.  I saw them on this tour (they opened with Enter Sandman), and they were fabulous.  Most of my \\"friends\\" at college told me I was going to get killed at the show because they \\"heard\\" people die at Metallica concerts (I stopped hanging out with them shortly after this.  Who says college educated people are smart?).  I'm still alive, and the only danger I was ever in was when two teenage fans thrashed a little close to me.  That was it.  The republic survived, and life went on for me, Metallica, and the two teens next to me.<br /><br />When you hear this album, it's so quinessentially Metallica.  You can't mistake it for anyone else.  It's a brilliant piece of record making, and it doesn't date at all.  It is no sellout, not even close.  Metallica has NEVER sold out, and probably never will, as the time to \\"sell out\\" has passed them by, and they are still here.  Their new album Death Magnetic hit #1 this week, which is proof of their amazing staying power.
B000UBMWG4|5.0|The Blade Runner five disc complete collectors edition was the first Blu-Ray disc(s) that I ever bought. At the time (January '08) Blu-Ray prices were still pretty steep, but this collection was about the same price as a regular Blu-Ray single disc. So being a fan of the film it was not a hard choice for me to make. The collection is by far the greatest package that I have ever gotten. There are five discs, one which is just a documentary (Dangerous Days) chronicling the entire creation of the film. The other discs are different iterations of the same film, but they have their differences. Either way they all have just about the best transfers (especially \\"The Final Cut\\") that I have seen on Blu-Ray and I currently own fifteen discs. This buy is somewhat of a no brainer for a owner of a Blu-Ray player especially if they are a Blade Runner fan.
B000VNMMQG|1.0|what a waist of money I bought it from a bible store and I wanted a refund or something.  ((It's slow and boring)) I don't know what the other reviewer saw but this isn't a good movie
B00005JO5L|4.0|Yeah...An ignorant person may assume that this movie represants ALL gays, and not just a small section.  And to an even more ignorant person, it would correlant rough sex with murder and violence.  But to people with half a brain, it is about a serial killer in an setting that most people don't find themselves in.  Is that any different than a movie about a far away place or time, say the 1800's with Jack the Ripper, perhaps?    There are 2 reasons why I consider this a \\"great movie\\".  1) Movies are consider an \\"art form\\". And art is supposed create a reaction and stir up emotion.  Ideally, even inspire behavior or action.  This movie certainly does that.  2) Good art, or a good movie, should be provactive, and leave you thinking about it and feeling something about the people in it afterwards. And again, I think this movie does that.  One is to wonder, \\"Did they get the right killer? If so, who killed the neighbor? Is that death just a sign that there will always be a new killer to go after? Or did Al Pacino's charactor kill him? If so, was it based out of his own frustrations of what he went through?\\"  Also, I think the movie cannot help to make you wonder about a part of our culture that you may not have thought about before, and your own views about your own interests on some level.    Isn't that what art is supposed to do?  Make you feel and think?
B000005GUL|3.0|\\"Der Freischutz\\" was traditionally performed as a country-bumpkin opera, full of stomping, hearty peasants, a style whcih appeals to German speakrs but doesn't export well. Weber's refined score deserved better and got it when Carlos Kleiber swept away the lederhosen-and-sausage hijinks in his famous DG recording. In its shadow, this 1958 recording feels earthbound, although it must be said that this is the genuine article from that era. The hyperactive five-star review is at least right about the generally fine singing. Grummer makes Agathe's treacherous \\"Leise, leise\\" aria sound easy -- she is mellifluous and lovely throughout, if not quite the equal of the even more refined Janowitz for Kleiber.<br /><br />All the male leads are fine, throwing themselves into the rustic goings on with Teutonic gusto (pardon us outsiders who find that a bit ominous), but Rudolf Schock is too beefy and thick-sounding to make an ideal Max, and his lack of artistry sometimes steps over the line from rustic to flat-footed. Even the Berlin Phil. plays gruffly, and Joseph Keilberth, despite his near-coronation in recent years thanks to a reissued Wagner \\"Ring: cycle, proves to be what he always was, a skillful conductor who knows his business but falls short of being inspired. The great dramatic overture feels blatant in his heands, although he's quite good with singers.<br /><br />In all, this good-sounding reissue teeters between three and four stars in my judgment. Listeners who don't mind its occasional crudeness will no doubt be satisfied.
B00192KCQ0|2.0|Okay, now I don't claim to know metal, if there's such thing. It's just a genre. Bands I listen to are Sabbath, Maiden, Danzig, Pantera, etc., and of course Metallica. Now I have to admit I love the black album. Even though metallica went mainstream, it's still a heavy hardcore record. And that's what this one is missing. See.... you have to grow. The reason many bands end is because they don't want to repeat what they've done, it takes guts to quit something you love, but if you just don't feel it, then it's done. I hate to be a critic but I can't feel james's voice. It's like he's trying to convince you they're still heavy metal punks. But the record just me made have to admit....nothing gold can stay. Now you can say it's heavy ,because it's maybe catchy or because you don't want to admit your heroes have fallen, but if you listen to the album, at least be honest about it to yourself. And check out \\"....And justice for all\\" not for comparison or even because it's \\"early Metallica\\" but just to hear some real heavy metal punks playing for the hell of it.
B000G8NXYG|5.0|Some films do get better with repeated viewings. Akira Kurosawa's 1954 black and white film Seven Samurai (Shichinin no samurai) is one of them. It was well deserving of winning the 1954 Venice Film Festival's Silver Lion, as well as the two Academy awards it won for Best Art/Set Decoration and Best Costume Design. On a first view it's simply a great action film, but with subsequent viewings the finer points of characterization come through in each moment, seeping into the mind subliminally and purposefully. The story, at nearly three and a half hours in length- including a five minute intermission, is never weighted down with fat, as all of the many subplots bear fruit- so unlike most films made in Hollywood today. It became an international sensation, and the highest grossing Japanese film of its day.<br />  Yes, there are remnants of the stale samurai genre, such as the wise man Kambei Shimada (Takashi Shimura), and the `boy on the verge of manhood' in Katsushiro Okamoto (Isao `Ko' Kimura), and his romance with farmer Manzo's daughter Shino, but the central human dilemma of the 16th Century farmers who are helpless against the depredations of the bandits, who abound during the civil wars of the era, raises the film above mere clich&eacute;s. We only see the bandits at the beginning and end of the film. There are about two hours where the meat of the tale takes place, and not a bandit is in sight. How many films do away with their bad guys for so long? How many could afford to? Since we do not know any of the bandits' names, they are more like a singular character, or a sheer force of nature. Why do they keep coming to attack the villagers, even as their forces are successively thinned with each failed raid? They must realize that the once helpless villagers have hired defenders? There is no Darth Vader among the bandits, despite George Lucas's latter-day attempts to cite this film as an influence for his banal and downright puerile Star Wars saga. We also learn that the villagers are neither as poor nor innocent as they portray. There are murderers amongst them, who have killed samurai before. They also seek to lowball and underpay their protectors.... It is a truism that almost all great directors have at least one great collaborator. With Ingmar Bergman it was his cinematographer Sven Nykvist. With Federico Fellini it was his musical scorer, Nino Rota. But with Kurosawa it's not only great stars like Mifune and Shimura, but his co-writers, Shinobu Hashimoto and Hideo Oguni- part of a rotating staff of writers that muted some of Kurosawa's own admitted over the top tendencies in storytelling, and brought the tale down to a human level. Without them the film may have been little more than a greatly stylized genre film, rather than a great film, period.<br />  The cinematography Asakazu Nakai, and score by Fumio Hayasaka are also very good, although this is an actor-driven vehicle. Nakai's deep focus techniques- at the time cutting edge, are every bit as good as those in Citizen Kane. Especially, look at the complexity of the many crowd scenes, where many little stories play out as we watch the foregrounded action of the samurai. Things like this are only gotten on repeated viewings, and with my second viewing I picked up much more than on a first glance, especially while not having to read the subtitles. And look at how jungle twigs seem to leap out at the viewer, as does Mifune's huge phallic sword as he slings it over his shoulder. The whole film was shot in a 1.33:1 aspect ratio, so one wonders what Kurosawa would have done with this film in widescreen.<br />  There's no doubt that Seven Samurai is a great film, and with its length and complexity it will only grow in my estimation as I view it more and more over the years. Of that I'm sure. But, that said, I do not think that it is Kurosawa's best film. I'd still lean toward Ikiru for that honor- for it's simply the more deeply human tale, and Shimura is even better in his role as Watanabe the doomed bureaucrat than as Kambei the indefatigable warrior. However, this is the granddaddy of all great action films, from Sam Peckinpah's The Wild Bunch to even James Cameron's films like Aliens or The Terminator series, as well as a great bildungsroman for Katsushiro. It also struck me, as the film opens to drumbeats, how reminiscent this film's opening is to that of my beloved Godzilla- a film that was released in the same year, with the footfalls of the monster dominating a black screen filled with credits. While Godzilla is nowhere in a league to Seven Samurai as a film, it is the second most influential Japanese film of all time. That both rely on such primal sounds in their openings makes one wonder if there's a connection.<br />  Yet, the thing that Seven Samurai has that few other films do is its incredibly detailed richness. From the bad skull caps the male characters wear, to the ambush tests Kambei devises to recruit his cohorts, to the old woman who goes to kill a hobbled bandit with a farm instrument- to avenge her son's death, and many others; all of these and more make repeated viewing a necessity to truly appreciate this film, for all of these things are non-essential to the basic plot, even as they heighten the realism of this unreal tale. Let me end by stating that Seven Samurai is every bit as good, and great, as its greatest champions claim, and I ask you, how rare a thing is that?e the doomed bureaucrat than as Kambei the indefatigable warrior.

B00003CXC7|5.0|While Psycho is my favorite Alfred Hitchcock movie, Rear Window is a close second, and it is to my mind the classiest suspense movie he made.  Jimmy Stewart and Grace Kelly provide that classiness.  Cool and brazen Grace, subtlely provoking Jimmy at every turn, knowing he is stuck helpless with a broken leg in a cast, while she cavorts about getting too close to the murderer, and enjoying his nervousness.  The murderer is played by Ramond Burr in a strange role for him--but he is very scary.  In a stroke of genius, Hitchcock provides us a cutaway view of the appartments across the way and the dramas going on inside of them.  We start getting invested in the stories of the inhabitants.  Thelma Ritter adds something to the movie that it could not do without.  As Stewart's private duty nurse, her no-nonsence philosophies of life are very necessary for thorough scene development.  I never get tired of watching this movie.  Barbara Bel Geddes is also very good as Jimmy's secretary.
B000E1YVZU|3.0|Let me state that I have never been a fan of musicals. I loathed most of the Golden Age Hollywood musicals that my parents loved, and those from my youth, the 1960s and 1970s (Hair, Jesus Christ, Superstar, Godspell, etc.), did not move me, either- at least dramatically, even if the songs were great. There's something about people breaking out into song that is just so forced that, dramatically, is too much to overcome. Perhaps the only film musical that totally worked for me was Evita, and that's because it was one long music video, from beginning to end, with literally only one sentence of spoken dialogue. However, musicals have been making a comeback in film. Moulin Rouge led the way, a few years back, and it's a truly great musical, if not a film. Chicago won an Academy Award for Best Picture the following year, even though it's not half the film, nor musical, Moulin Rouge is. Then, came the Cole Porter biopic, De-Lovely, and, well, Cole Porter, Cole Porter. It was a very good film that incorporated music wonderfully and intriguingly into its plot, the life's tale of the legendary composer. Next came Rent, the film version of Jonathan Larson's late 1980s musical that dominated Broadway last decade, which updated Puccini's opera, La Boh&eacute;me for the AIDS era. Surprisingly, while only also a great composer of ballads and rip roaring rock tunes. Without doubt, Rent has as many great songs as Hair or Godspell ever did- perhaps more.<br />  Yes, the actual story the tale tells is slight and often silly, if I'm being generous....Yes, the characters are stereotypes and caricatures, there is no real development of their psyches, and the film ends in shameless melodrama- the abandoned and now homeless Mimi's death and resurrection, and preachiness- in its regard of the anomic, dead transvestite Angel as somehow the apex of the human experience. But, as I always asked people who harped about the 1998 Hollywood version of Godzilla, `What did you really expect from a film where a giant lizard stomps on New York; Brando in Streetcar?' Similarly, what can one reasonably expect from a work that glorifies AIDS suffering in such a Romantic light, as well the inanities and irresponsibilities of young drug addicts and sexual freak shows who somehow believe that the world owes them something merely for their breathing, and that having to actually pay rent to someone to live somewhere is a form of fascism? If you answered, `Well, maybe, good music,' you are absolutely right, and, fortunately, Rent has much of that to spare. Ultimately, the music, and Larson's brilliance in the crafting of his infectiously catchy tunes, is the film's saving grace. And, when has even a little bit of grace ever been a bad thing?a giant lizard stomps on New York; Brando in Streetcar?' Similarly, what can one reasonably expect from a work that glorifies AIDS suffering in such a Romantic light, as well the inanities and irresponsibilities of young drug addicts and sexual freak shows who somehow believe that the world owes them something merely for their breathing, and that having to actually pay rent to someone to live somewhere is a form of fascism?

0800130928|5.0|The haunting musical soundtrack to this movie contains some of the most beautiful jazzy pieces I have ever heard.  I had a custom tape made from it at one time.  The story is a great psycho-drama with all of the players perfectly cast.  Jodie Foster is believable as the \\"baby prostitute,\\" Harvey Kietel, chilling as her pimp and Robert DeNiro is so fascinating to study as Travis Bickle, wierd product of NY subculture of the streets and psychological textbook example.  It is, in retrospect, a brilliant example of post-Vietnam War 1970's atmosphere in the large cities of our country.  Maybe too wierd of a movie for some to watch, but a mainstay of the viewing repretoire of a true artist.

B00192KCQ0|4.0|For those Metallica fans who still haven't bought this album fearing another St. Anger or Reload, or who have only heard the singles on the radio, it may still be worth it to give this album a try. However, do not expect it even to come close to the four original recordings. I believe this album is evidence that they will never return to their roots, perhaps because one of the four horsemen fell back in the late 80's.    Let me start with the bad. First, the production is less than great. The production really does hurt the songs. However, I am willing to overlook this, perhaps because the production was so much worse on St. Anger. Same general flaw though: it comes off sounding over-produced, like the band was actually trying to make it sound bad, as if that would somehow recapture the feeling on Kill 'Em All.    Secondly, for the most part, the singles are awful. The Day That Never Comes is probably Metallica's worst ballad, other than Low Man's Lyric. Cyanide sounds like it belongs on Reload. The Judas Kiss is pretty weak. My Apocalypse is the strong track of the four, but it still comes off as a poor Slayer cover. Finally, The Unforgiven III is completely unnecessary with a chorus that sounds like it was lifted directly from Stone Temple Pilots' \\"Creep.\\"    Third, the lyrics are weak. Part of what made the first four albums so good was that while they were absolute thrashers, the lyrics were intelligent and reflected the times. While the lyrics here do seem to try to reflect the times, they don't come off as quite so intelligent. Perhaps Hetfield wants to leave some things to imagination, but the \\"in your face\\" attitude from the first few albums is gone. Maybe this is a sign of the band's maturity, but it still feels like something is missing...    So...why four stars? Because the first three tracks are absolute crushers, All Nightmare Long is absolutely brilliant and combines the best of Justice with the best of the Black Album. Finally, Suicide & Redemption...is an instrumental! And it's an exciting instrumental.    The ultimate product is a mix of the best and worst moments off Justice and the Black Album. This album, indeed, would sound less out of place if it had come after Justice, rather than after the horrendous St. Anger.    This album is not a resurrection of old Metallica. It is a culmination of a career spanning more than 20 years. Some of the same mistakes are made on this album, but I think the five really good songs make up for this. Fans of Metallica's golden era should not overlook this release.
0783225849|5.0|No dispute that Alfred Hitchcock's \\"Psycho\\" is a masterpiece.  No argument that Bernard Herrmann's score is also brilliant, iconic.  BUT, in searching here on Amazon I found this alternate music soundtrack by this group called JoKr.  I was listening to the mp3's on their page on Amazon here, and it's pretty cool.  It sort of reminds me of that old stoner thing they say you can do with Pink Floyd's \\"Dark Side of the Moon\\" and \\"The Wizard of Oz.\\"  The name of the 2 disc album is \\"PSYCHOsync.\\"  Check it out!
B00158K0S8|5.0|Patton is one of my favorite movies of all time.  I was excited to get it on Blu-Ray and have not been disappointed.  The transfer is fantastic for such an old film.  I am not a Blu-Ray snob who is going to go back and compare DVD quality, but you can notice the difference with Patton.  It is worth the price and definitely worth it right now with the But 2, Get 1 sale going on.  Add this to your collection today!

Another victim of the loudness war. Tragic really. This album is unlistenable as it is right now. Do not buy it like this. Wait for a real version.
0920668372|2.0|While this book has a \\"sweet\\" premise of the circle of life, I think it is a book for an adult written as if it were a children's book. I was balling by the end of it. It is very depressing to see the man rock his dying mother. Our son was given this book as a gift and I will not keep it in his library. I think that if I actually read it to him, it would make him depressed and would conjure up ideas of his parents mortality long before he needs to think about that. I  especially would not read this to a child before bed.
0156029065|2.0|I agree with Bruce Kendall. Funny review because it's so true!    Umberto Eco is probably single-handedly responsible for inspiring the academic dimension of my high school and undergraduate imagination.  However, I now shun his more recent efforts.  (And I even read Travels in Hyperreality and How to Travel with a Salmon!)    With Baudolino, it would seem that Eco aims not merely to illustrate the medieval world but to articulate that world through a medieval mind.  The result is, sadly, next to nonsense.  I had great expectations for Baudolino - set amidst the Crusades, after all!    Despite my gratitude and respect for the author of the magnificent \\"Name of the Rose\\" and \\"Foucault's Pendulum\\", what I learned most from \\"Baudolino\\" is the courage to stop reading a book that no longer seems interesting or relevant to me.    If you have never read Umberto Eco, I can only recommend \\"Rose\\" and \\"Pendulum\\".  The hapless \\"Island of the Day Before\\" spirals on to a dull colophon that is as unsatisfying as \\"Baudolino\\".  I haven't picked up \\"Queen Loana\\" but I figure I've now traded my time for other reads.
044661758X|5.0|Michael Connelly is a writer of thrillers out of the ordinary. His appetite for Hieronimus Bosh, the detective strong personality, endearing, noble sentiments, insightful, human is shared with the reader. \\"The Concrete Blonde\\" grips your guts and does not leave you a moment of respite. Stress will go crescendo. Bright story. Rebondissements, surprises, tiredness, ... Nothing is spared to the reader who asks himself who is the killer. Great art. One of the best Connelly.
0793518326|2.0|This book is quite comprehensive, and probably covers everything possible to write down in notes and tabs regarding the music of The Beatles. You can't play through an entire song while looking in this book. As all songs are written down with vocals, two different guitars, bass, drums etc in parallel, you have to scroll through several pages to get through the song. In order compress all this information into as few pages as possible the author have used very small types. So you need to keep your head close to the book while playing if you want to get the information.  This makes me think this book is written for \\"conductors\\" and teachers who want to get the whole picture in order to instruct groups and ensembles, and not for the individual musicians. Probably this book would work out well as bedside lecture for the theoretically minded musicians. The more practical oriented would probably find better sources elsewhere.
0688101364|5.0|A very well illustrated book with delicious and easy to follow recipes.  Rose covers everything in this book from storage to shelf life and lots of handy tips.  The recipes are great , fun to make and delicious,  I thoroughly recommend this book for amateur cooks to professionals.
B000ELJBAK|5.0|I was happy to re-discover this awesome disc of Gilmour's early solo work.  It's packed full of tasty guitar solo's and David's classic vocals.  I believe this disc has been overlooked by most Pink Floyd fans.  I can't help but wonder why it is rarely played on classic-rock radio.  Even Gilmour himself has abandoned most of these wonderful songs.  I would love to hear the instrumental \\"Raise my Rent\\" on his next tour.  This is a strong five-star disc for any Gilmour Fan!
B00192KCQ0|4.0|I've waited twenty years for this.  Metallica has returned to their old classic sound heard on their 80's thrash masterpieces.  But for some reason Metallica can't manage a decent production.    First, let's look at the songs themselves.  These are fast, heavy, technical, long thrash songs like the ones on ...And Justice for All.  The lyrics are dark and often cryptic, and that's a good thing.  The solos are frantic and fast, something I haven't heard from Hammet in a long time.  James kind of growls, although it's in a slightly higher register than the 80's.  But his delivery is believable and well done.      The album follows the Lightning/Puppets/Justice song flow, with a hyper opener and closer, a fourth track that starts out clean and goes into hyperdrive by the end, and a ten-minute instrumental close to the end.  By far this is the best Metallica album since Justice.    But then we hear the actual mix.  Like Justice and St. Anger, this album has a horrible mix.  On Justice I believe it was a way of saying \\"Cliff's not here\\" because if you boost the bass about 30 dB you can fix that album.  The mix on St. Anger was just plain bad.  Death Magnetic has a better mix than St. Anger, and it has more bass than Justice.      Except for some reason they applied their amplitude maximizer to up the average RMS to 13.37 dB.  Most albums these days are around 10 dB (and have audible distortion if you listen closely), and audiophiles prefer around 6 dB.  This lack of headroom produces a lot of clipping to the point of distortion, especially on \\"The Day that Never Comes\\" in the middle, where Lars's snare is clipped so badly that it just sounds like static.  I haven't noticed it as badly on the other tracks, but I've heard better mixes from punk bands recording in their garages.    I'm hoping that this really isn't Metallica or Rubin's fault, because CD's have been getting louder and louder for years.  But 13 dB is really pushing the limit of the 16-bit digital medium.    But, ultimately, like Justice, the songs are strong enough that you can get past the clipping and enjoy the songs, and celebrate Metallica's return to form. (Dave Mustaine did it first though!)    Also, the Guitar Hero versions are mixed much better, possibly due to the fact that they had access to the original masters and make their own mixes for the game.
B0018D4SHY|4.0|For a Richard fan trainee, it's what the Dr. [Rock] ordered! If one can live with the audio loss at the start of \\"Tutti Frutti\\", there's plenty here to make one's big toe shoot up in his/her boot: the full length \\"Ooh My Soul! (longer sax solo than on the 45rpm); one of the rough demos sent by Richard to Specialty in early 1955, \\"Baby\\" [later titled \\"Baby, Don't You want A Man Like Me?\\" and recorded professionally by Specialty and Modern, about 10 years apart]; and the rarer than rare medley from June 4th, 1964, with \\"Ain't That a Shame\\"/\\"I Got A Woman\\"/\\"Tutti Frutti\\", all showcasing great g-box work by either Dewey Terry or Glenn Willings.<br />The deeper-pocket deeper-afficionado might wanna spring for the Ace Box with about 90% of what a 1950s' Richard fan could dream of.<br />But the matter at hand is a nice package, with a great booklet, with nifty notes by Billy Vera (a few mistakes, but baby....that is R & R!).
B00192KCQ0|5.0|Well, I'll be the first to admit that I'm a huge Metallica fan: No doubt about it.<br />I'm gonna try not to let this to get in the way of my review....here it goes<br />There were a lot of people wanting for Death Magnetic to be a big fiasco, but guess what, they are going to be very disappointed...this is Metallica at their best, they hit it out of the park: monster riffs, incredible solos, unbelievable lyrics.<br />I would strongly recommend:  That Was just Your Life, All Nightmare Long, The Unforgiven III, The Judas Kiss, Suicide & Redemption and My Apocalypse.<br />A lot of voices are saying that Death Magnetic is a resurrection for Metallica, I really don't think this is the case, let me try and explain why:<br />1) I can't think of another band that has been so relevant over the years (27 years to be precise) in the heavy metal scene than Metallica, even with the infamous St Anger, they managed to get people (critics and fans) talking, good or bad, but talking.<br />2) They have always done what they want, If you don't believe what I'm saying, just Google for Fade to Black (a \\"ballad\\" from 1984's Ride the lightning), you'll see that 24 years ago they were called \\"sellouts\\", so the real point here is: As indulgent as they are with their music, they have done whatever they want taking the good things and the bad things as well.<br />3) Try to beat that, punks!<br />Basically if you are a heavy metal fan, and above that a true music fan, you will get this cd!<br />Peace
B0017ASV1C|3.0|De Niro and Pacino are excellent actors and their abilities save this movie from being a total piece of Dreck. If the word F**K was deleted from the script there would be no screen play and if you deleted the profanity there would be no plot.  You wonder if Russell Gewirtz who wrote the screen play has a vocabulary larger than the average rapper.  The play is poorly written and not helped by pedestrian if not amateurish direction.  The close ups are too many and extremely unflattering to all of the actors -- especially Pacino and De Niro who are not young any longer and the director accentuates that. The lighting makes everyone's personal hygiene suspect which is exacerbated by the unkempt and unshaven appearance of the actors. I was especially annoyed by the highly implausible sex between De Niro and the female officer who could easily have been his granddaughter.  Then the S&M twist to this implausible love affair added nothing to the film.  The director (Avnet)and the screen play attempted to insert twists and surprises throughout the film but the plot was so transparent that these seemed amateurish.<br /><br />Essentially this is a film about two teams of police detectives investigating a series of crimes that appear to be committed by a cop.  There is violence, sex, drugs, and blood galore, but as you can see not much of a plot.  However, the movie is entertaining and the surprise ending isn't very surprising.  I enjoyed the movie but I doubt that any of the actors will claim this as the highlight of their careers.  I gave it three stars because De Niro and Pacino are always a delight and they do save this movie from disaster.
B00005MP58|5.0|I just love this version of Jane Austin's story.  The book was amazing, but I believe this is very good and true to the story.  Of course, the details of the book can't all be included, but this includes quite a bit due to the amazing 5 hour duration!  They did add some things not in the book, but I thought they were good additions.  The acting is wonderful, inspiring the full range of emotions.  I also love the Kyra Knightly version, and Bride & Prejudice, but this is the one I chose to purchase for my video library.  It's a MUST HAVE for Chick Flick lovers!
B00127RAJY|4.0|As someone who has previously lost 60 lbs and gained back about 20, I've been looking for a way to jumpstart my losses again, particularly inches.     I decided to give this work out a try. I just finished up day 4, and I have to say I already feel much better, stronger, and my pants aren't digging into my tummy anymore. I don't expect to have as dramatic a pound loss as the package claims, but this is definitely a good starting place. It's also very good if you're short on time.     I did have to take 3 days off after day 1 because my muscles (particularly lower body) were so sore. But, picking it up again gets a little easier every day, and I am also combining it with 30-40 minutes of cardio and a lower calorie diet.     I gave it 4 stars simply because I feel that the cooldown/stretch session is not adequate. I do add my own stretches afterwards, but for someone who is a beginner, and may not know much about setting up a proper work out, I suggest doing research on different cool down stretches.     All in all, I do recommend this DVD if you're looking for a quick, all-over body work out :)

B00000J8EK|5.0|This album is a classic. It gets a little uneven toward the end, but not even as badly as their others, especially the overrated Dig You Own Hole. This is the best, most original they ever sounded. Followed by the hugely underrated Come with Us, these two albums make a case for the Chems as one of the best dance acts ever. Forget your Joy Division. Turn on the lights and enjoy.

This was  well written, directed and acted and posed tremendous questions about choice, good and evil and the erroneous belief that all of our problems can be laid at the feet of someone else.  It brought out some of the same feelings I had after watching \\"Wicker Man\\" or reading \\"The Lottery\\".  Disturbing but not disgusting, not for the faint of heart.

B00006GO9Q|5.0|Miles Davis-In A Silent Way *****<br /><br />Released in 1969, In A Silent Way was Miles' first real fusion jazz album. Yet another way in which he would change the world of jazz and music for I think it was the fifth time. Where [[ASIN:B0012GMWEI Miles in the Sky]], and [[ASIN:B0012GMVVM Filles de Kilimanjaro]] his two previous albums hinted toward where he was going with In A Silent Way, this took it to a whole different level. A truly electric jazz album, In A Silent Way introduced the world to one of the great guitar players, John McLaughlin. But more than that it introduced us to the three electric keyboard team of Herbie Hancock, Chick Corea, and Joe Zawinul. All three of which were to become three of the most influential keyboardist/composers to emerge from the time.<br /><br />The trio co-wrote the stunning title track, 'In A Silent Way' which consists of two parts interrupted by 'Its About That Time' which only adds to the brilliance of the piece. It is a just under twenty minute piece of jazz bliss. Miles wails through out, but does so subtly. Wayne Shorter and Dave Holland take the album to new heights through their work on the title cut. Hollands bass is some of better playing heard through out the album while Shorters Soprano Saxophone work is nothing to bark at. Mclaughlin's beautiful guitar work closes the album and does so chillingly.<br /><br />'Shhh/Peaceful' which is a stunning eighteen minute opener, and while not as memorable as the title cut, or as famous it is still one of Davis' strongest pieces.<br /><br />In A Silent Way is one of fusion jazz, and Miles Davis' finest hours. A truly original set of work that could find a pleasant home in any collection of jazz. Highly recommended.
B00004ZAV3|2.0|I know I am in the minority...but the Beatles' success was a product of their era; overrated! They would never make it today! A couple good songs that are only good because they remind me of a good movie or commercial. Don't bother if you were curious like I was.
031606792X|5.0|In reading the reviews, I am beginning to thing that Twilight's adult readers are forgetting that this is a love story based on a fantasy world.  Bella and Edward are soul mates who are destined to be together but with a future full of obstacles.  Stephenie Meyer's ability to draw together all of the elements of classic literature in a modern piece are brilliant.    The pillow scene made me laugh, Edward's personal distress during the pregnancy made me cry.  For readers who are concerned about the story sending the wrong message, I ask: Why must every book have a \\"message\\"?  Literature is about escape, hence the word \\"fiction\\".  Adults concerned about teens reading this need to remember that they cannot look at it from a teen point of view because they are adults.  Young adult readers are more sophisticated than we give them credit for.  Why is it so bad for the good girl to get what she wants?  The most important element, in my opinion, is that Edward also gets what HE wants without having to sacrifice his \\"tortured soul\\" (by changing her against his will).  Jacob has always been connected to Bella and so the imprinting element allows him to find happiness and relief from his internal struggles.  Breaking Dawn finishes the saga eloquently and appropriately.  I hope that Midnight Sun will get finished so that we can gain insight into Edward's thoughts (only fair, right?) and watch how his love for Bella grows, despite his personal anguish in the process.
B001CD6FKS|3.0|Speed Racer, at least on Blu-ray, is definitely more than a little sensory overload in the visuals.  It's bright, flashy, glitzy and just about every other descriptor you could use to say such things.  The transfer is as good as you'd find and Blu-ray is well served by the ability to show off such a visual spectacle on home screens.<br /><br />Does that mean the movie is good and demands to be seen though?? Uh, not so fast there.  As story telling, character driven entertainment Speed Racer isn't bad, but it's not going to win any awards (at least not ones that you'd want to win) either.  The story is basically lifted straight out of, or at least is very heavily inspired by the old anime TV series and brought into movie format.  What would have stretched across 4 or 5 episodes of the cartoon classic is instead given all in one complete package.<br /><br />Fans of the TV series will enjoy the film if they can get past the visual bombardment that they'll be subjecting themselves to here.<br /><br />NOTE that there is quite a bit of flash and color on the screen at any point in time, but in a few scenes there's incredibly heavy doses of same.  Persons that are sensitive to strobe effects should avoid this film or be well aware of the potential impact before sitting to watch it.

0618918248|1.0|In this book, Dawkins puts the whole of his effort in ridiculing those who believe in a higher power. This is in place of (not in-addition to) producing a constructive argument that would make this read more than just the ramblings of an layman atheist. Dawkins' lack of experience in religious argument makes it very awkward & uncomfortable to read. I'm amazed at the overwhelming success/acceptance of the book despite it's painfully obvious short-comings. In a word: disappointing.

B0007MWZEK|5.0|After many different products that cost a lot more, we bought the swivel sweeper for our home with laminate floors. We love it! All of our friends now have one and they love it as well. I run a retreat center and we serve multiple meals to other 15,000 people a year. After breakfast and lunch we use two swivel sweepers to quickly pickup everything on both tile and carpet. We use a regular vacuum after the last meal of the day. Yes, the batteries run dry after about 6 months, but they are very cheap to replace. Our employees love them.
B000ULQV0W|5.0|'Guaranteed' is one of the most beautiful songs I have ever heard. It makes my heart ache every time I hear it. The instrumentals, the vocal, the lyrics, they just send me. I was never a big Pearl Jam fan through the nineties, so don't expect any accolades or comparisons here. I \\"googled\\" Eddie Vedder just to find out who he was. I recently rented the dvd and the music has haunted me every since then. I bought the cd and enjoyed listening to it tonight. The 'hidden' track came on while I was busy cooking dinner and I had left the cd in play. I might never have known about it otherwise. This cd is as long as it needs to be. I enjoy listening to several different cds during the course of the evening, and 'Into The Wild' definitely makes it into my playlist. My taste leans toward acoustic, blues, jazz. 'Long nights' is my favorite song on the album. The thing about these songs is that they are true.
1400095204|3.0|Two ebony-coloured Igbo (African) sisters, one outstandingly beautiful and the other thin but attractive, the former in love with an Igbo intellectual  and the latter with a white Englishman,are the protagonists in this novel. The civil war between the enterprising christian Igbos and the conservative muslim Nigerians forms the flaming back-ground.When the British left India, dividing it into Muslim Pakistan and Hindu India, there was sectarian violence in which thousands were killed and millions uprooted,Hindus migrating from Pakistan to india and Muslims to Pakistan from India.But no novel has so far depicted  that tragedy with the same force, sensitivity and timbre of immediacy (i.e., feeling of being present at the event) as this novel does with reference to the conflict in Nigeria.The description by the younger  sister how the body of her servant stumbled  a few steps after the head had been knocked off by a shrapnel,is disturbing but realistic.The novel also shows that the war coarsened people by narrating the incident where the house-boy, otherwise decent, joins in the rape of the bar-maid.When Western Nations divided up Africa for themselves, they did so without regard to ethnic homogeneity  and when they left, the mixed populations in such territories had to find the necessary adjustments themselves. Adjustments were not easy to make and bloody conflicts resulted.  This book is not only a good novel. It is also a balanced critique of the aftermath of Imperial withdrawls.
B00192KCQ0|5.0|Metallica may not want to admit it, but this release was do or die for them after the debacle that was St Anger.  Death Magnetic is the perfect apology for St Anger if you ask me.  This is a classic return to form for a band that's been lost for a while.  When in doubt, do what you do best... and that's exactly what they've done. These songs will translate very well to a live audience and I can't wait to see them on the road.  One last thing, there are some people who aren't fond of the mix, but I don't see what the big fuss is all about.  Yes, I've read all the details about clipping and distortion, but I find nothing that distracts me from enjoying an excellent CD.  Perhaps it's my equipment, but I'm completely satisfied with the sound.  At any rate, be your own judge.  If you have any doubts, give it a listen.

0307269752|4.0|In Sweden financier industrialist Hans-Erik Wennerstrom successfully sues Millennium magazine financial journalist Carl Mikael Blomkvist for libel and defamation of character.  Mikael cannot believe he lost as he thought his proof was solid that Wennerstrom had used state funds intended for investments in Poland in an arms deal.  The reporter refuses to appeal; he will serve his ninety days in gaol and pay the damages and court fees. He has no idea how the Minos Affair scandal as the media dubbed it turned so wrong.<br /><br />Milton Security's top researcher tattooed Lisbeth Salander looks into the trust factor of Blomkvist for a client.  She speculates that he was set up by someone in the Wennerstrom fiasco, but is honest to a fault.  In Hedestad eighty something industrialist Henrik Vanger hires Blomkvist to learn what happened to his beloved great-niece Harriet who vanished decades ago.  Henrik explains that when Harriet was twelve she baby-sat three year old Mikael, who did not remember that.  The elderly man wants Mikael to uncover the truth of who killed the then sixteen year old Harriet in 1966; as she instead of her brother would have run Vanger Enterprises as she was the talented intelligent one of her generation.  He agrees but the family does not truly cooperate so he gets nowhere until Lisbeth joins his investigation, which increasingly finds powerful men hating women of substance.<br /><br />THE GIRL WITH THE DRAGON TATTOO is a superb Swedish thriller that grips the audience on two fronts.  First is the libel case in which author Stieg Larsson vividly describes the government-industrial complex ripping off taxpayers to set up fake business ventures; the second is the investigation into the Vanger family.  Readers will be fascinated with the business scandal, but enjoy the whodunit even more as that is fast-paced and exciting.  The first Millennium Trilogy tale is a strong investigative thriller, a great homage to the talented author who past away a few years ago.<br /><br />Harriet Klausnerarriet Klausner

1563890119|5.0|This piece of fiction is one of my favorites of any genre, not just graphic novels or comics.  Sandman is compelling and original in its characters especially in the way Neil Gaiman weaves myth and traditions into an unfolding scene. There are very few books I can read or movies I watch were I can't either predict what will happen next or predict the end. With Sandman Preludes I couldn't predict anything and it was great to be taken on a trip with dream.<br /><br />Which brings me to the five reasons for 5 stars:<br /><br />1) The showdown in between Chorozone, the High Duke of the Eighth Circle and the Dreamlord.  This was a very, very interesting twist on the old \\"shoot out at the OK coral.\\" I loved it.<br /><br />2) The reaction John Constantine has to Dream and then their working together to find dust in the second quest. Very original.<br /><br />3) Mr Burgess, the occult leader, wants to control death. (who doesn't) He ends up failing and ends up unintentionally bringing a sleep sickness onto the world. This is a twist in storytelling I hadn't seen before.<br /><br />4) The return of Doctor Destiny, is very interesting.  But be warned this is an extremely dark and disturbing place. He has the finally element the Dreamlord seeks to restore order and it gets all screwed up.<br /><br />5) How weirdly indifferent, yet human the main character and his sister are. Even though they are not humans you will recognize them and their compassion, however, that side is juxtaposed against cold, unfeeling or maybe unknowing side of inhumanity. In the final chapter you meet her, the one none of us what to meet. Death.<br /><br />This is not just a light reading comic book, this is a dark graphic novel.  You get taken on a trip, an adventure worthy of a vivid Dreamlord. It has some humor but I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone feeling dark already.<br /><br />The art work, ink colors and backgrounds are all fantastic and only serve to enhance the story.  This is a great graphic novel!
074325144X|5.0|A good friend of mine recommended this book to me when she heard I was training for my first marathon. It changed my perspective on running, and other sports for that matter - where I can accomplish more by \\"going a different route\\". I enjoy running more now, and am able to go longer distances without the effort and strain I had to go through before. I really like this book. It's out-of-the-box thinking.
0385340990|5.0|I've become wary of books that are OVER marketed in every bookseller,however with this one, the justice was well due.<br />A charming story was made from a terrible situation and the main character had such wit, honesty and quirkiness, that I'm holding out to meet someone like her one day.<br />Easy, short read and one that will want you wishing for more of these voices we read in the letters.
B00192KCQ0|5.0|I've given every Metallica album since '...And Justice For All' a chance and have been disappointed in some form or fashion.  'Death Magnetic' is a cool album, it incorporates the entire career of Metallica into one album... played in vintage Metallica style.      The arrangements remind me of '... And Justice For All', lots of heavy riffing ala 'Master of Puppets', a little bit of a sense of groove and melody from the 90's era (but not too much).  The playing is fantastic, the songs are good, the vocals are better than they've been in years, the lyrics aren't as bad as some people say, the record sounds great.  The only sound song I don't really care for is 'Unforgiven III'; I really like the rest of the songs.  Probably a 4 star album, but I'll give it 5 because I've really enjoyed it the last week.    They'll never be the same as they were in the 80's... That said, this a very enjoyable record for an old fan.  I thought the Pitchfork review was a little off the mark.  I'd like to see an Amazon review, thought it would be up by now.

This read is not a quick one, if you take the time to get into all the detail of the people, and the lay of the town.  It draws in at the first sentence.  to the very end, you want to know more about the citizens of Lansquenet and Vianne and Anouk.  We know from preview of Ms. Harris' book, that they move on, yet you want more of the inhabitents of the town.    Recommend it highly vs the movie, yet the movie ( bought the Penguin release with movie cover)  will grab you also.

B000ADWDF2|5.0|One of those movies that'll definitely throw you for a loop, `Brodre' is not the movie I thought it was going to be, not in the least.  That said, `Brodre' is honestly one of the best movies I have had the privilege of seeing in recent memory for it struck such a tone with me, resonating deep in my gut as it contorted itself into such an emotionally resounding masterpiece.  There are moments so quietly sincere within this film that I found myself shaking because I was so caught up in what I was beholding, not to mention the overwhelming foreknowledge that devastation is bound to overtake this seemingly loving family.<br /><br />`Brodre' tells the story of Sarah and Michael, a seemingly happy couple raising their two daughters Natalia and Camilla.  When Michael is sent to Afghanistan and thought to have been killed Sarah and her daughters try and patch up the pieces of their shattered existence with the help of Michael's younger brother Jannik.  Jannik is the black sheep of the family.  While Michael was serving his country Jannik was serving time for armed robbery.  Michael's demise though has brought Sarah and Jannik together, both of them missing Michael sorely and relying on each other to fill the void his death has left.  The thing is that Michael has not died, but was captured and is being held prisoner awaiting his rescue.  Their lives have already been turned upside down by Michael's disappearance, but his return causes even more grief and heartache as his suspicious and jealousies threaten to tear the entire family to shreds.<br /><br />What blows my mind about this film is how it appears to be one thing (a fragile romance between a lonely widow and a guilty brother) and turns out to be something so much more.  Michael's experiences in captivity are really what fuel the second half of this marvelous character study.  Much is made of the budding romance, but that said romance is really just a blinder for what the film is really about; guilt.<br /><br />Michael is so overwhelmed with guilt for what he has done (I refuse to give away the secret) that he allows himself to find fault with and or accuse his family, the ones he loves most, of almost anything in order to remove his guilt.  He hates himself so much that he needs to feed on hatred for others to free himself from his own pain.  He knows that his wife is not in love with Jannik and he knows that Jannik would never attempt anything with Sarah but he cannot allow himself to reason on the matter for if he did then he would only be able to hate himself, and we as humans are programmed to love ourselves, no matter what the cost.<br /><br />The performances within this film are borderline brilliant, especially that of Ulrich Thomsen who portrays Michael with so much humanity we are left aching for him.  He is so confident and so strong in the beginning, but as his time in captivity ticks away we see him crumble, and then his tragic turn as he returns home is so overwhelming, so brutal that I can't give him enough praise for capturing his characters every emotional shift so accurately.  Connie Nielsen is also fantastic here as Sarah.  She manages to create a very sympathetic yet realistic portrayal of a woman on the verge of losing it all.  Nikolaj Lie Kaas probably has the most difficult character to develop and he does so wonderfully, making Jannik a very understandable and sympathetic character despite his flaws.  His drunk scene, where he hears about Michael's death (which he actually played drunk), is outstanding and so raw; it may actually be my favorite scene in the film.<br /><br />When all is said and done, `Brodre' is one of the most heartbreaking yet truthful films I have seen lately on the subject of human reaction to ones self.  This is not a story about infidelity or about war or about marriage as much as it is about one mans war with his own actions, his own feelings about his actions and how we can single-handedly destroy ourselves by not accepting the courses we take.
0316066524|5.0|I didn't, like one reviewer here suggested, look up every word I didn't know in the dictionary (and there were a lot. Antinomy?) I didn't even read all the footnotes, because after a while this was, even though it was a great book, one of those books where you start staring at the width of the pages you've finished and the pages you have left in order to measure how far you are and how many days you're going to be working on this. But it was obviously brilliant, and I learned an incredible amount. Yes, it can be tough, yes, there are periods where you want to give up, but like anything good it's hard and pays off. And it's a very amusing story. I was sad to hear about Mr. Wallace's death, and I know he will be missed in the literary community.

B000Y1ZXUM|3.0|Sometimes I get more excited about the quality of the Blu-ray than the actual performance. This Blu-ray is only marginally better than standard dvd. (Rating **)    This time the performer got all my attention. Skakira is hypnotic through out the concert. Her charismatic voice, her confident eyes, her beautiful face and a body that moves in ways you may have never seen before.     She's just pure energy and a joy to watch even if I can only understand the words of half the songs. (rating ****)    We pay a premium for the HD Audio and Video of Blu-ray.  This disc is one that should have been labeled Enhanced Standard DVD.
B001AJVR5M|1.0|this \\"album\\" implying that it is infact music.. does not convey the suck that exists in plenty. I think buing this trainwreak of music for your children should be on the same level of abuse, as chaining your kid to a bed in Michel Jacksons house. Cliche pop format with lyrics that would embarass The Monkeys.. Do your children a favor and ban this album from their frail impressionable ears. Give them some Zepplin or at least Hanson. I would even put slipknot as a less offensive band for kids. But i digress, avoid this music like you would avoid Rosie O'donnel holding a wooden spoon at a free prostate exam convention.

0553582038|2.0|I dont know what it was about this book... I loved the first three! Even when he would make up new characters (probably to replace all the main characters that were killed in the previous novel) he still kept them intriguing and well developed. I started this book hoping that at least some of the original characters would appear sometime in the novel, but instead i was bombarded with dozens of new names to remember. I know this was only half of the book and the other half will tell of the previous characters' stories, but this doesnt make any sense... why didnt he incorporate them into this book, so at least some familiarity would be present... is the next book only going to be the new characters from the last book or the original characters? I couldnt even finish this book leading me to place all four books on the shelf. I might pick it up sometime again when i can find nothing good, but for now they collect dust.
159102594X|5.0|Mature, fantasy readers must read this. If you haven't read The First Law trilogy, go buy it. Now.

0142000671|5.0|Although you can read this book in just a few short hours, the relatively few words found in \\"Of Mice and Men\\" carry tremendous weight. From the first paragraph Steinbeck manages to paint a vivid picture of the environment, taking great care to simultaneously describe both the beauty of nature and the agony of the story's characters.<br /><br />I'd long considered Hemingway's \\"The Sun Also Rises\\" to be the greatest American 20th century novel, and after reading \\"Of Mice and Men\\" last evening it's clear this story has assumed the #1 spot in my personal list of greatest novellas.
B000ADWDF2|5.0|I won't go into details about what the movie is about others have already done that.  This movie is excellent.  It is at times rough, brutal, and it doesn't shy away from or flinch from touchy subject material.  This is a movie about war and the impacts and ripple effects that war and the actions one makes while at war can have on a family.  Don't expect that this to be a happy movie.<br /><br /> The interplay in the family between the brothers is also an interesting aspect of the movie.  Because I think the filmakers could easily have done just a war movie yet the play up to the whole good v. bad brother and yet you realize at the end of the movie there is no good or bad brother we are all just people trying to live with the difficult decisions we make every day.  and \\"good\\" people can make very bad decisions.  that doesn't make them any less good does it?<br /><br />I was worried about the love triangle but the film makers didn't ruin the movie or make it too soap operay.  The actors in this movie are amazing.  This is really a great movie and a must see.
031606792X|5.0|Excellent Book. Actually the whole Saga is one of my favorites. I really think that it shouldn't stop with this book. Mrs. Meyer's skills as a writer of the life of Bella and the Cullens should continue since there are so many ends to tie. I recommend this book to all of those readers that really get involved in the different and new worlds presented by the writer.

0439023483|5.0|The Hunger Games was a superb read.<br /><br />I was immediately engrossed in Katniss' life and experiences.  The story was fast-paced and exciting and the novel well-written.  It has a similar flair as Scott Westerfeld's Uglies Series as it has survival and political themes.<br /><br />I am looking forward to the next book in the series to see what happens with Katniss and her family and friends.  In the meantime I'm recommending The Hunger Games to all the teens (and other patrons wanting a good read) that come into the library, and thinking about reading it again.
B0000AQS0F|4.0|I had seen a few episodes and knew I would enjoy the entire series so bought the DVD Complete Series. However, I am disappointed with some aspects of the DVD Set. It was a good decision to move the `Serenity' episode to the beginning. Though aired as Episode 11, the writers originally intended it to be the pilot. It was the last episode aired before cancellation though three more episodes were released 7 months later. I think the show would have lasted longer had `Serenity' been aired first as it introduces everyone and includes the why about many things.<br /><br />What I don't like, nor do I understand, is that other episodes are placed randomly on the set.  Most sets have the shows in order of release, this set does not.  I am still confused with the timeline of the series.  Per IMDB, the set's three \\"NEVER AIRED\\" episodes were aired 7 months past the series end.  But IMDB shows episode 12 as airing after episode 13 & 14. I think the dates are a misprint on IMDB as the DVD set Special Features allude that \\"The Message\\" was the farewell episode.<br /><br />The DVD jackets show Heart of Gold, Trash, and The Message as NEVER AIRED. I know this is false as I have seen all three on television myself.<br /><br />The Special Features shed light into why the show is not on any more.  My impression, FOX exercised too much control and doomed the series from the beginning.  Had they allowed Joss Whedon the freedom granted Jonathan Glassner and Brad Wright for Stargate SG-1, firefly would have lasted much longer.  Then unanswered questions could be answered, such as who was the Sheppard really?<br /><br />This show is great to me because, aside from being in the future and outer space, it's not always the extraordinary each episode as in a Stargate SG-1 or Atlantis.

B000002L7R|5.0|Thanks to the collaboration with Wendy & Lisa, this album tops my list of Prince releases. It's breezy, funky, and yet deep. Prince's religious bent doesn't interrupt the proceedings as much as in his later albums, but still shows up where appropriate. Wendy Melvoin and Lisa Coleman had a strong influence on the music in this album, and it shows.<br /><br />Again, this is a Prince album that needs to be played from beginning to end without shuffling. It tells a story, builds a narrative, and takes the listener on a musical journey that must be experienced to be understood.<br /><br />Vastly superior to anything he did in the 90s, Around The World In A Day marks the near-end of Prince as a fun artist, and the beginning of his delving deeper into religious themes. In this album, that helps him. In later albums, the piousness bogs him down.<br /><br />Along with \\"Parade\\", this album also marks the best work he did with the Revolution, his best band to date.
B001BKXUOQ|2.0|I love all three albums with the 9. Self/titled was the most amazing and fresh sound with sick original EVERYTHING. I love everything about it and still listen to it relentlessly. Then IOWA proved this band was like no other and they were amazing, new, and different from the first album, and i can't stop listening to it either. When Subliminal released it was another success. I love, love, love these albums.  At this point, I thought they had to be the best band I had EVER heard in my life and I loved every single song. It is Proof that a band can put out brilliant, original sound, with the most talented group of individuals and they were unstoppable.  I can't stop listening to these albums and I have never found a band that is so captivating before.  What happened? AHIG has 3 good songs.  It DOES NOT sound ANYTHING like Stone Sour and people need to stop the comparison.  This is just a bad release, nothing else.  It sucks because we waited for so long, but we had such high expectations after 3 amazing albums and if this had been the first one, it would have been the last.  There, I said it. This album sucks, but, if they stay together, I will buy the next album.  I LOVE this band. We have been blessed with 3 good cd's and if that is all we get, it is way more than any other band has produced.  I still love the 9, Come Back!!!  (but NOT on MTV. I can't stand marketing television(MTV) and Psycosocial?? That song title is sad.)  They will come back better or we are screwed. Who can top this band??????
B000002KY8|5.0|There's not much that hasn't already been said about Prince's \\"1999\\" - It's some of his best work, from the era when he wasn't so deep into his religion and wasn't afraid to offend someone. It's raw, real funk-rock that knows no bounds. I would call \\"1999\\" Prince's best album, except that I'm also partial to the collaboration with Wendy & Lisa in his later Paisley Park releases.<br /><br />This is an album that is meant to be played straight through. No shuffling. No listening to individual tracks. Start at the beginning and play it through to the end. It's a brilliant work of art that everyone should check out if they like rock or funk.
0307269752|2.0|Henrik Vanger, an elderly Swedish industrialist, has long been receiving the same anonymous gift on his birthday: a single framed flower. He is convinced the series of flowers has something to do with his great-niece Harriet who vanished decades ago in mysterious circumstances when she was just 16.<br /><br />Vanger coerces a disgraced and prison-bound journalist, Mikael Blomkvist, to do some research into the disappearance. In exchange for information on his niece, Vanger promises Blomkvist enough dirt to take down the rich man who is sending him to jail.<br /><br />So begins \\"The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo,\\" a blockbuster best-seller in Europe. As Blomkvist moves closer to the truth, he teams up with the titular character, a tattooed detective named Lisbeth Salander who's the real star of the show. Together they uncover things that stun even Blomkvist, a crusading financial reporter who thought he knew all there was to know about the rot of corruption, the myriad abuses of power and the darkest sides of ourselves.<br /><br />The novel is long and sometimes feels even longer; it takes its time threading out the dense plot. There's a lot going on here. This is the kind of book that provides you with a family-tree chart upfront; by midpoint you may be wishing there were even more aids offered by the author to keep track of things.<br /><br />There is a series of horrible crimes at the heart of \\"The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo,\\" but I hesitate to call this work a thriller. It's a crime novel, yes, but it has more on its mind than generic conventions. The author, the late Stieg Larsson, was a journo in the muckraking tradition, like his character Blomkvist. The book serves up a heapin' helpful of essay that tastes like story but isn't. And while the mystery element is shockingly compelling in spots, it's also surprisingly unsurprising in others.<br /><br />A million Europeans can't be wrong, and I'd be dishonest to say there's nothing worthwhile about this novel that is so popular across the pond. Despite its stop-and-go pace and tortuous (and sometimes tortured) construction, there is a serious emotional undertone to the book that is undeniable.<br /><br />If you're not yet bored with stories that present villains you've seen a hundred times before -- e.g., reactionaries, racists and capitalists -- you might just enjoy this. Me, I really wanted to like this book and I did, but just barely. It's a lesser \\"Smilla's Sense of Snow,\\" and for many that's obviously enough.its stop-and-go pace and tortuous (and sometimes tortured) construction, there is a serious emotional undertone to the book that is undeniable.

B000OVLBGC|5.0|What a fantastic, thought-provoking movie this was! I was half expecting it to be dark and gloomy. I mean, the premise of having private citizens' privacy invaded is very dark and frighteningly real in today's world; but I love the way the writers and directors were able to inject some lightness (with the Captain's bedroom habits), irony and a great deal of humanity.    The ensemble cast members are all fantastic and portrayed their characters with such emotion and sincerity that I couldn't help but be moved. The historical accuracy of the film educated me a lot, since I'm not too familliar with modern German history. Nevertheless, despite the un-Hollywood ending, I like the positive message of the belief that one single person can make a difference in this world. This movie is a must-see!

B0012BTBQU|5.0|The best thing about Mistborn is the basic premise. A great many epic fantasies (most? all?) follow the same general idea: the end of the world is coming due to some sort of great evil, and one man or woman is prophesized to stop that evil. Mistborn basically starts a thousand years after that prophesized hero failed. The grey and ash-covered world is ruled by The Lord Ruler, an evil immortal \\"god.\\" Man is more or less separated into two groups: noblemen and the skaa, who are slaves to the noblemen. The idea is that the noblemen are descendents of The Lord Ruler's supporters right around when the world ended, and the skaa are...everyone else. Some of the noblemen are born with magic powers, referred to as Allomancy that works by swallowing different metals that the person \\"burns\\" to release the magic. An Allomancer who can burn one metal is called a Misting; an Allomancer who can burn all ten Allomancy metals is called a Mistborn (you either can burn one or all of them). Occasionally, due to noblemen fraternizing with their slaves, skaa are born with Allomancy. They are hunted by the book's version of the Gestapo, called Obligators and Inquistors.  The first book in this series follows Vin, a young girl skaa who has been a part of an underground skaa thieving group. She gets noticed by Kelsier, a Mistborn from an elite underground skaa thieving group, who discovered his powers are suffering in, and escaping, the Lord Ruler's most brutal prison. Kelsier realizes that Vin is also a Mistborn and recruits her to be part of his plan to overthrow The Final Empire and free the skaa. Vin, however, has been terribly abused during her times on the street and is reluctant to trust Kelsier, or anyone.<br /><br />I would say this book's greatest flaw is that sometimes the characters are a little clich&eacute;d and stereotypical, Vin especially. Kelsier is definitely more interesting--he is greatly flawed as the \\"hero\\" figure with  a tendency toward fundamentalism and egocentrism.<br /><br />With that said, I think everything else about this book was fantastic. The plot moves relatively quickly, despite the fact that the characters can be clich&eacute;, you still care about them and what happens to them, and the plot twists are not always foreseeable from a mile away (unlike, say, in Eragon). I heard some people complain about the dialogue, but I'm usually remarkably sensitive to bad dialogue, and it never bothered me once in this book. I agree that Vin sounds a bit too educated for an orphaned street urchin, but I can allow for artistic license there so that Vin can still be an engaging protagonist.<br /><br />This is, without a doubt, one of the most creative books I've read in the genre. By the time you get to the end, you'll question basically every tenet you believed to be sacred to the field of epic fantasy.at said, I think everything else about this book was fantastic.

1556900236|5.0|I have to say Susan Adams did a remarkable job narrating this book. I truly felt Anne Frank was talking about her life in the secret Annex to me personaly. I homeschool three of my children, and chose to do the audio version, so they could all hear and feel at the same time. This makes discussions much easier about the book. Everyday we listened to one of the six tapes and it leaves you so spelled bound. You cant help but feel that your own problems with life can't compare to sweet Anne Franks. This true story of Anne Frank, will stay with us for the rest of our lives, you can't say that to too many books. I give this five stars, for many reasons I cannot discuss in one review. Try for yourself and you will understand. God Bless sweet Anne Frank.
0765356139|5.0|The second book in the Final Empire series starts up a while after Vin defeats the Lord Ruler. Elend Venture has taken over as king of Luthadel, trying to establish a modern, more enlightened type of government, including a Congress-like Assembly made up of merchants, skaa and noblemen. Vin acts as Elend's bodyguard, protecting him from several assassination attempts by kings who have taken over other sections of the Final Empire after the Lord Ruler's demise.<br /><br />But all is not good. Two armies have set up camp outside of Luthadel, Elend's father leading one and an influential politician from the West leading the other, and a siege has begun. Everyone is hoping to get their hands on The Lord Ruler's secret stash of alium; unfortunately, Elend and the remaining members of Kelsier's crew have not located it.<br /><br />To make matters worse, Sazed, who has been traveling to spread his knowledge now that The Keepers no longer have to live in hiding, has heard accounts of the mist killing people. The mist also seems to be staying around longer and longer into the day. Prophesy comes back into play, and a strange mist-creature and a faraway pulsing beat begins to haunt Vin. It seems that the Lord Ruler's dying words--that he was preventing some great evil from taking over the world--might have been true after all.<br /><br />Again, one main problem with this novel--the characters are again a bit clich&eacute;d, but in this book it gets slightly worse with a drawn-out \\"drama\\" between Vin and Elend where they can't seem to communicate to each other and misunderstandings take place and love is thwarted and blah blah blah. That is not a plot line I ever enjoy in books, I just find it old-hat, annoying and laaaaame. I thought it was completely distracting in this book and unnecessary and I wish Sanderson had left it out. I feel like one fault of his is his inability to make engaging love stories. I can't even put my finger on why exactly, I just don't really find myself caring about Vin getting with Elend or Sazed and his interest or Ham and his macguffin wife. Like, with Vin and Elend I can get why they would love each other, I just don't \\"feel\\" it--you know? I don't know, they're no FitzChivalry and Molly, I'll say that much.<br /><br />That said, the Vin/Elend drama is an extremely minor aspect to the overall book, which is just as fast-moving and otherwise creative as the first. The plot twists, for me, were also equally surprising as they were in the first book, and the mysteries remained mysterious until the book wanted them revealed. I am unbelievably excited for the third book. Like the first, this book has a quasi-satisfying ending , but the overarching story line is still up in the air.

0156421178|5.0|My mother spent a frightful childhood in revolutionary Barcelona near the cathedral \\"Sagrada Famila\\"...FAI/CNT (anarchist)territory. Orwell's account in \\"Homage\\"is accurate and reveals his honesty as a journalist.<br /><br />Mother told me about the compulsory closed fist salute she had to give as a young child in front of the local church (turned FAI/CNT party headquarters). The buildings in her neighborhood were bedecked with the red and black colours of the anarchists, and her frightened crawling across the kitchen floor as bullets flew between the closely billeted Left militas every night were a nightmare come true. A horrible period of history...the precursor to WWII on the streets of Spain.Orwell did not let ideology hamper his account of the facts. There is more detail than dialectic materialism in \\"Homage\\".<br /><br />The hospital scene is particulary morbid...Orwell survived a shot to the neck by a Fascist. This section of the book reminds me very much of an essay (\\"How the Poor Die\\") he wrote about his brief stay in a french charity hospital during his transient-bum period, circa 1929, detailed in \\"Down and Out in Paris and London.\\" We can be thankful that we no longer have depression era hospital care.<br /><br />My mother's family were secret members of the Flange who issued false Costa Rican visas, mostly to clergy who were asked to work in my mother's backyard digging redundant trenches...the condition of ones hands determined the fate of many at the hands of the proletarian police who assessed the class ranking of people by the roughness of their hands as they crossed the French border. This fact is accurately described by Orwell in \\"Homage.\\"<br /><br />My family took one of the french refugee ships mentioned in the book just ahead of Communist agents. The hotels mentioned in the book were really controlled by the various militias-the churches were really gutted. Orwell's honesty and decency shine in \\"Homage to Catalonia\\".<br /><br />The real tragedy of the Civil War was the defeat of the center and the legitimate relatively moderate government of Spain. The chapter on the political factionalism of the Republic are historically valuable and not as unreadable as readers say.<br /><br />Orwell describes the chaotic infighting among the Left factions joined to the Republic which my mother witnessed on her street. Like the German Weimar Republic, the Spanish Republic largely lost the support of the army.The army defected to the Flange and the government was defended my a motley assortment of union and party militas: CNT, FAI, POUM, ect. which resulted in chaos for the Republic.<br /><br />Ironically, the Republic had earlier relied on Franco to crush a coal miners revolt which threatened its stability...perhaps this is what is met by the term \\"right wing socialism\\" which is mentioned in the book in reference to Negrin.I am also left wondering about Negrin and the definition of a \\"right wing socialist\\". Can anybody tell me?<br /><br />Interestingly, Orwell never mentioned the Right factionalism which plauged Franco: Carlists,Monarchist, and the Nazi element of the Flange represented by General Suarez who had conflicts with reactionary Flangists.<br /><br />The Suarez-Flangists later became the ill-fated \\"Blue Divison\\" which perished in Russia. Then again, Orwell would have had no way of knowing these conflicts since he was not a rightist.<br /><br />The Soviet role may have been positive in that it supported the legitimate government, the Republic, and helped to maintain order in the rear areas (with tragic results) while the fight against Franco continued.<br /><br />Orwell wrote that the token aid to the Republic provided by England and France, the latter being a Soviet ally, was puzzling and tragic. Would a stronger Soviet influence have resulted in a viable Republic? Why were the democracies so slow to react to Spain's tragedy? I am guilty of ethical utilitarianism in thinking that the Communists were possibly apositive influence on the Republic?<br /><br />Orwell was honest and detailed about the Spanish dilemma. \\"Homage\\" enshrines Orwell as a reliable literary time capsule- a gifted travel journalist...one of his goals stated in his essay \\"Why I Write\\".<br /><br />\\"Homage\\" is far better than many of his novels (pre-1940) which suffer from horrible character development and is well worth your time.positive influence on the Republic?<br /><br />Orwell was honest and detailed about the Spanish dilemma. \\"Homage\\" enshrines Orwell as a reliable literary time capsule- a gifted travel journalist...one of his goals stated in his essay \\"Why I Write\\".<br /><br />\\"Homage\\" is far better than many of his novels (pre-1940) which suffer from horrible character development and is well worth your time.
B0013IKUIK|5.0|After reading the reviews, the expectations were so high I didn't know where to start. So instead of listening to the album all the way through, I put the whole thing on my mp3 player and put all my songs on shuffle. This way I have been getting to know the album slowly throughout the last few weeks. Every time a Bon Iver song comes on I literally stop and say \\"Wow! What's this?\\" Though I've come to love each track respectively, 'Skinny Love' has quickly become my favorite song. Ease it in to your collection. You won't be sorry.

After one weeks use the jets had to be cleaned with a needle, and it's dangerous to use while driving because you can't see if it's lit. Usually it isn't because it's no where close to windproof.
B0014Z4ON4|4.0|A prequel to RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK, INDIANA JONES AND THE TEMPLE OF DOOM follows Indiana from China and through India as he attempts to get back to civilization.  After being double-crossed by Chinese gangster, Lao Che (Roy Chiao) in a nightclub, Indiana (Harrison Ford), nightclub singer Willie Scott (Kate Capshaw), and young sidekick Short Round (Jonathan Ke Quan) find themselves on the run and flying over India.  Left to die in a crashing plane, the trio escapes and eventually find themselves in a small Indian village.  The crops are dying and the people are weeping in mourning.  The village leader tells the visitors that the reason for their trouble is because the ancient cult of Thuggee has been revived.  The Thuggees have stolen the village's Shiva lingam, a stone that Indiana comes to believe might be one of the Shankara stones, and have kidnapped all of their children.  The village elder claims that the Thuggees are headquartered not far away in Pankot Palace. He believes that Indiana Jones and his friends have been sent from some higher power to help them.  The village elders agree to take Indy and his friends to Delhi, but only if they first go to Pankot Palace.  Indy agrees, more out of curiosity and the chance for \\"fortune and glory\\" than anything else. A disgusting meal, a horrible death, and a mine car chase all follow.<br /><br />Most viewers find INDIANA JONES AND THE TEMPLE OF JONES their least favorite Indiana Jones movie. That's not to say that ToD is a bad movie because it's not.  ToD is filled with action and memorable scenes, e.g. the nightclub scene, the dinner scene, the sacrifice, the mine car chase, et al.  There are all kinds of witty one-liners.  I really enjoyed the character development we see in Indy through the movie, especially in his relationship with Short Round.  Also, the acting is really well done from star Harrison Ford to Amrish Puri as villain Mola Ram to the small bit parts and cameos such as Dan Akroyd.<br /><br />With so much good stuff in it one may wonder why ToD is one of the least-liked parts of the Indiana Jones saga.  I think the reason for this is because of the shock factor of certain elements of the movie e.g. Mola Ram ripping a man's heart out of his chest while it is still beating or the special dessert of monkey brains at the dinner.  These scenes are memorable, but they are completely unnecessary to the film.  The dinner scene is just as funny and disgusting without the monkey brains in it.  The sacrifice scene is just as horrifying without seeing the beating heart being ripped out of the victim's chest.  These scenes and others like them made ToD more violent and scary than it needed to be.  Scenes like these in the movie turned away many parents and brought rounds of protest when the film was originally in theatres.  In fact it is because of ToD and GREMLINS (two movies that Steven Spielberg was associated with) that the PG-13 rating came to be (both of these movies would have been rated R if it hadn't been for Spielberg's association with them).  Parents and other adults complained they were too violent for children, but children were the prime targets for the film.<br /><br />I like INDIANA JONES AND THE TEMPLE OF DOOM.  There were parts of it that frightened me a great deal when I first saw it as a child. However, over the years the film has grown on me.

0596522347|5.0|I'm not Steve Jobs, but I do take pride in designing presentations I need to make for life. I didn't know what to expect from this book after hearing some positive things- but I'd read almost all the recent books on the subject (most of which the author cites). Slideology's strength is that it covers every element of slide design from colors and transitions to use of charts. The book itself feels more like a coffee tab art book. Not much text, lots of negative space. It's nicely designed. The book is a great reference to have around - more so than other books on the subject.     A few highlights-  - Tons of chart types and their meanings  - Color coordination tips  - The idea to use post it notes for planning    Another treasure this book has a list of \\"Further Reading\\" at the end that includes works beyond presentations.     I found all the video or animated slides tedious even though the ideas were impressive. Also, almost all the case studies in the book were trivial at best. Sort of the, \\"I know this awesome guy and he makes presentations for work and they look like this!\\"    In any case, if you have never read one of these presentation books, buy this one. If you have read all of them, buy this one too, since. If you're Steve Jobs, you can pass.
B001CD6FKI|3.0|First off, lemme say that I've never watched a complete episode of Speed Racer in my life. Sure, I may have caught a segment or two, but even when I was a kid I thought this show was too \\"kiddie\\". So after the huge, over-hyped movie version crash and burned earlier this year, I was curious to see what went wrong. I'm surprised, what did go wrong here?<br /><br />Let's get one thing straight, this is the type of movie that will give your eyes diabetes. Colors scream at you, objects fly past the screen like lightning, and images are always in constant motion. Audio-wise it's like sleeping inside an engine, with the motor-roars tearing you apart. But at an amazing 2 hours and 12 minutes it just runs too long. Trust me, I didn't need to see the cartoon to know what's going on here, the history is laid out for you in just-too-deep detail. Not that the cast weighs the story down, they're actually pretty good in this, but to me this is one story that could have used a bit of an edit job. And how deep should a plot be for something called Speed Racer anyway?<br /><br />If Speed Racer ever had a Ben-Hur-like episode, this is it. With all the CGI effects, bordering between impressive and \\"Oh, C'mon!\\", this little Asian to America classic cartoon has been given a royal treatment that quite frankly it didn't deserve. Sure, it's really entertaining in parts, but it didn't have to go as far as being the Star Wars Episode III with racecars either. Looks good, less filling. I honestly can't see any official Speed Racer fan not hitting High Gear with this one. For those fanatics, it's your true blue honoring of the series. But to others like me, after all the special, and I do mean special, effects you may wonder what warranted it in the first place. So what went wrong? They paid tribute to a show with a motion picture that frankly could have been twice as less spectacular and gotten the same overall result.<br />(RedSabbath Rating:7.5/10)

B00192KCQ0|3.0|I was surprised to see all the negative reviews about the production. Sounded fine on my system. (And no, I don't have anything fancy or expensive.) No clipping or anything like that. I would just say that the sound is too friendly for metal. I would expect this kind of squeaky-clean-radio-friendly rock sound on a Linkin Park album.<br /><br />Music-wise, it's got its moments. Some cool riffs here and there. But while it's more metal than anything they've done in almost 20 years, their song writing just isn't up to their old standards. Kirk's solos are probably the best thing about this album.

Its not as truly great as the \\"big ones\\" (MoP, AJFA, your own personal fave) but the top tracks here are instant classics and will play on and on in their tours, tribute bands and wherever people love classic metal.  For me, those tracks are That Was Just Your Life, Broken, Beaten and Scarred and All Nightmare Long.<br />Man, i love All Nightmare Long.  LOVE IT!!<br /><br />I think James's voice has actually improved over time.  His range has improved, and he seems to have more of a \\"character\\" rather than just trying to sound vaguely threatening.  The rest of the band performs admirably, I really feel like Lars's drumming is stagnant and hasn't changed or improved in a very long time.  Compared to the pantheon of madmen banging on skins in the metal world these days... Lars is the Ringo Starr of metal drummers.<br />And finally, the production... I just have to wonder what they were thinking.  THe compression on this disc is insultingly overdone.  There's plenty that's been written about it, and I'll just say I agree that it tarnishes this diamond of an album.<br /><br />Metallica deserves the praise, and this album deserves a remastering, and then let it go 10 platinum.
B00192KCQ0|3.0|After one listen of Death Magnetic, it is safe to say that Metallica has lost its direction. If we assume Metallica was on an evolutionary path, St. Anger was a departure from that path and Death Magnetic is a return to the middle of the path.<br /><br />I eagerly awaited this release, and my anticipation doubled when I saw \\"The Unforgiven III\\" was a track. More on that later. Each track is filled with rapid guitar riffs and solos, as if Metallica was trying to out-speed Megadeath all over again. I pity those trying to play this in Rock Band II or Guitar Hero.<br /><br />As for \\"The Unforgiven III,\\" I found it to be a complete departure from the first two Unforgiven songs, leaving me wondering if the title was applied to this song by Metallica's record label. If so, I certainly fell for it, buying it unheard. Its a good song, but not worthy of the \\"Unforgiven\\" lineage.  The piano intro is nice.<br /><br />One final thing to consider is how this CD fits in the chronology of Metallica's releases. Earlier I said that this is a return to the middle of Metallica's evolution. The track lengths and non-radio-friendliness certainly evoke the early work of Metallica.<br /><br />If this really is new material, it feels like it should have come right before St. Anger, as it could easily be the bridge to St. Anger.  St. Anger would not have been such a drastic change had this CD been released before it.  Especially when it comes to the drumming, it sounds like St. Anger, but without the tin cans (which I liked in the songs St. Anger and Frantic).  Speaking of the drums, I feel like every song on this CD used the same drum loop over and over.  I know Lars is better than using loops.  What's up with that?<br /><br />UPDATE: After several listens, this CD has started to grow on me.  I think \\"Broken...\\" is the best song on the CD and is worth of being called a modern Metallica song.  In addition, I like the depth of the lyrics for \\"The Day that Never Comes\\" and Cyanide is catchy at times.<br /><br />My biggest complaint is how 90% of the CD sounds like one long extended jam session.  I marvel in awe as to how they could actually put this together.  As much as I dislike the jam session sound, the ability for four guys to play through these 7+ minute songs without making a mistake is amazing.  They really are talented.<br /><br />This CD reminds me of why I was not a Metallica fan until the Black Album.  I give them 3 stars based on the fact that I know they can do better.how 90% of the CD sounds like one long extended jam session.  I marvel in awe as to how they could actually put this together.

B00005UW9T|5.0|Ok. For starters this is an adorable little movie about one \\"orphans\\" struggle to belong and find happiness. Its not supposed to be historicaly accurate it never CLAIMED to be historically accurate. Your supposed to take it for what it is instead of throwing and excpecting all these hidden meanings in it. Yes, Rasputen is a very graphic character but any reviews of him \\"scarring your children for life\\" should be COMPLETELY disregarded as having a very wimpy child and nothing more. For christs sake people, its a cartoon. Now I don't reccomend anyone under the age of 4 watching this movie alone. A childs greatest comfort is its parents/guardians so take a break and watch it together. Almost eliminates the chance for being scared. I give it 5 stars and btw, my 1 yr old little girl watched this with me and laughed at the parts where rasputen was falling apart. Im serious, NOT a scary movie at all.

B0014DBZY2|5.0|I just happened upon the Foals in a completely random acquisition of some mp3s.  I loved the album so much, that I purchased the physical CD to support the band.  Indie music most definitely, but unique in the sense that every song on this album is wonderful! This album is one of those rarities where the album is a complete joy to listen to. You won't want to listen to only one song on here. The entire album is fun and upbeat.  I listen to this at the gym, when traveling, in my car or just at home.  I really think that the Foals are going to hit it big in the US in all due time.  After discovering this album about 4 months ago, I have been really dying to see them live.  This type of music is the stuff that would be even more enjoyable in a live setting.  I can't wait to see what else comes out of this group!  They are definitely a new favorite.

1402714572|5.0|I read the children's classic version of this book back when I was about 8 years old.  Since then I had always assumed that somewhere out there lurked the \\"real\\" version, which in my mind was pictured to both look and read similar to \\"The Three Musketeers\\" or \\"Moby Dick.\\"  When I finally got around to reading the \\"adult version,\\" I laughed when I realized that this is still a children's novel.  It's an old fashioned action adventure clearly written with little boys about the age of 12 in mind.<br /><br />The short summary:  Jim, is a preteen who lives with his parents at the little inn and tavern that they own.  A rough and unruly customer comes to stay with them, a salty old pirate with inappropriate stories and foul drinking songs.  Jim is enthralled with the man and befriends him; the old crusty pirate even pays Jim to \\"Keep an eye out for a man with one leg.\\"  When the rest of the pirates locate the inn where Jim and his family live, they make an appearance, demanding something that the old pirate had taken from them.  Through an act of both luck and bravery, Jim and his mother escape the pirates and take with them the hidden object - a map showing the location of an enormous buried treasure.  Jim, the good Doctor, and a few other individuals from town decide to rent a boat to go after the treasure... but when they start their voyage, a man with one leg joins the boat as the cook and the rest of the crew isn't behaving quite properly.  The rest of the tale involves mutiny, back stabbing, treachery, treasure, gunfights, castaways and adventure of the highest caliber.<br /><br />This is one of the most well written adventure novels I have ever read, and I have encouraged my 10 year old son to try to give it a read.  Back when this was written, I would assume that every 9-12 year old little boy (and many little girls as well) probably lay in their beds at night reading and dreaming of being whisked away by pirates to find buried treasure.  Since then our language has changed so dramatically that I believe that the under 12 crew may have difficulty with some of the phrasing and word choices in this novel.  If giving this to a younger child, I would plan to work with them through some of the tougher portions, specifically the technical bits about the ship (explaining what a mizzenmast is) and some of the pirate's dialogue which is often written phonetically.  You can solve the pirate problem by telling them to read it aloud and try to sound like Captain Jack Sparrow from \\"Pirates of the Caribbean.\\" My son had a much easier time when I would read those passages to him doing a pirate accent.<br /><br />Even if your much older than 12, I still highly recommend reading this, it is a quick read with a truly fairytale ending.  The good guys win and the bad guys lose and the moral of the story is honor, duty, keeping your word, and being a good person will bring you good fortune, whereas acting like a despicable pirate will only bring you down in the end.  There also seems to be a fairly strong anti-alcohol message in the book, as the good guys capitalize on the intoxication of the pirates over and over and rarely drink the stuff themselves.  It's not beaten over your head... but it might just be strong enough to make the little ones think \\"Well I'm not going to do that!\\"<br /><br />I couldn't recommend this story enough, for individuals of all ages; we are planning on reading it out loud at bedtime so that our 7 year old can enjoy the dreams of buried treasure and pirates.  There is a reason this tale has stood the test of time, and I suggest reading it yourself, and with your little ones if you have any.<br /><br />Parent note- in my summary I stated that the Pirate sings foul songs and tells inappropriate stories, these are not related in the book and are only reference in the fact that Jim's mother is horrified that the pirate tells him such things.  So you don't have to worry about profanity or any other lewd discussions.amatically that I believe that the under 12 crew may have difficulty with some of the phrasing and word choices in this novel.

B000ETQR3Q|4.0|Great toy. Bought this and the Recon, and I prefer this one for a mid-size rifle. Stock is two position, but can cramp larger hands in the collapsed position.  I was surprised by the breach cover that opens when in \\"bolt\\" is in the rearward position. Really cool and necessary if you get a jam. Scope is useless as expected. Comes with two mags, which is nice. Haven't had trouble with it yet, and is a very nice looking toy. Shoots well stock, and is a little tricky to mod if you want a little more out of it. The front gun is unnecessary and slightly ridiculous when attached, but is a nice addition if you want a pistol to loan out to someone. A little more expensive than the Recon, but I recommend this one over it by far.

B000WTTBWC|5.0|I love The Police and this is the definitive collection. A must-have.    But there's one tragic flaw: at least in the version I have (the original boxed set release from 1993), there's a serious mastering error at the beginning of \\"Roxanne,\\" arguably the most essential track in the bunch.  It sounds as if the analog master tape was not up to full speed when the digital master was being recorded -- the pitch and tempo are slightly off as the track starts and then it slides up to the correct pitch.  No!    I haven't heard any later pressings of the boxed set so I don't know if this problem has been remedied... but if you buy this, you might still want to spend the extra 99 cents to get the Outlandos d'Amour MP3 of \\"Roxanne.\\"

B00154GEFU|4.0|Asia Phoenix is a weird CD. It's as if we're back in 1982. The keyboard sound is pure analog synth. As at least one other reviewer noted, it does sound like Chicago circa 1982 but without horns.    Instrumentation aside, there are some strong songs that stand up well against their classic debut. Wetton's voice is still strong as are the instrumentalists.    If you like their classic 1982 recording, you will enjoy this one as well. You may be disappointed if expecting otherwise.    [DW]
B0002XNRG4|4.0|This is an ideal all-around lens. 85mm is great for portraits while 17mm creates a beautiful wide angle shot. The f-stop bottoms out at 4-5.6 but the IS makes up for this. For the money, this is a great lens for 1.6 crop cameras.     I give the lens 4 stars because there is some CA at 17mm, but depending on the subject its hardly ever noticed. In fact, I love using this lens at 17mm, at that zoom, you can get much more creative aw-inspiring images.

B0017ASV1C|3.0|Robert DeNiro and Al Pacino play a pair of aging partners in the New York Police Department in this flat crime drama. Over the years, the two officers have grown close. Both men have become disillusioned with life on the beat and with seeing dangerous criminals escape justice based upon what they see as legal technicalities. The two officers have issues with their career choices and with their personal lives, especially women. In the late stages of their careers, the two officers are assigned to pursue a serial killer of criminals who have evaded punishment for their misdeeds.<br /><br />The interaction between DeNiro and Pacino is adequately portrayed at best.  Unfortunately this interaction is not enough to save the movie. The story is told in an unnecessarily disorganized way and the pacing is slow. The scenes of city life, loneliness, grit, violence, and toughness that are essential to any noir movie or film of urban life are lacking. Photography and scenes are routine and uninspired. The result is dullness. These two fine actors, with memories of Taxi Driver and Raging Bull among other things, deserved better.<br /><br />Robin Friedman

B00154GEFU|4.0|I put off buying this CD for a long time.  The samples I heard, like others have said, sounded too much like something from a Wetton solo album, and there didn't seem to be much of interest going on in the musical/instrumental side of things.  The first time I listened to it, my fears seemed confirmed.  I felt pretty disappointed with it, but there were some interesting things going on instrumentally that I knew right away I wanted to come back to.  After listening a second, a third, and a fourth time, I was hooked.  The songs are very catchy and I have difficulty keeping them out of my head.  There are some cheesy cliches in most of the songs, but the first two Asia albums, which I've cherished for years, are cheesy, too.  There is a new maturity present in all four members.  Steve Howe is my favorite guitar player, and his style has become very streamlined here.  His newer simplified, more tasteful approach began with his Turbulence solo album, then he brought it to Yes with the Keys To Ascension studio tracks, and the evolution continues here in Asia.  It's part of why I was initially let down---at first, it hardly seemed like Geoff Downes, Steve Howe, and Carl Palmer were doing anything much at all, but they ARE, and some very interesting things, at that.  The proof of that, and the highlight of the album for me, is the breathtaking instrumental ending of \\"Deya\\".  It's simply stunning.

He also knows a secret process of antiquing the tape by passing it through a \\"Death Magnet\\" to dirty the sound quality.  Metallica liked this new, \\"distressed\\" sound style so much they named the album after it.

0143038583|4.0|Ominivore's Dilemma is a must read for those concerned both with the mis-allocation of agricultural resources.  Everyone deserves to know what Pollan tells us: the commodity corn industry has perverted the entire food production process, from the destruction of the land due to overplanting of corn and the intense use of nitrogen-based chemical fertilizers, to the force feeding of corn to beef cattle whose bodies can not naturally tolerate it, to the production of health-destroying products such as high fructose corn syrup and many other ingredients upon which the fast food industry is based.  The need for markets for subsidized commodity corn encourages cruel and unsanitary practices in the raising of meat animals and poultry, as well as the production of milk and eggs.  Even the organic food industry is caught up in this vicious cycle.  While Pollan's style is repetitive and his ultimate solution (completely self-sustaining local food production and consumption) a bit out of reach for most of us, his account is one that every informed citizen should read before he or she makes another food purchase or casts another vote.
B00005JNQS|4.0|This cute little movie (a smidge under 90 minutes) is an eye-popping visual feast, with roller-coaster vehicle chases; characters being swung, flipped, rolled and flattened; and lots of clever 'physical' humor and movement. However, I found myself wanting more of the plot and character development. There just isn't enough time devoted to introducing a character before the next action sequence begins. I'd have added another 15-20 minutes of showing the different robots interacting with each other and deepening our understanding of their motives, likes/dislikes and desires. Having said that, it stands up well to repeat viewings (my two toddler girls absolutely love it and would rate it 5 stars) because there is so much going on in each scene that you find yourself noticing things missed the first (or second, or third) time around. The core morals taught are sound \\"you can shine, no matter what you're made of\\" and the visual effects are top-notch. All in all, watching it leaves a person feeling like you just stepped off the Tilt-a-Whirl at the fair after eating cotton candy and funnel cakes all evening--giddy, exhilarated, lightheaded but in need of something a bit more substantial.

1416550518|3.0|The House at Riverside is well written and has a great sense of atmosphere, but I just did not really enjoy this book.  I've never liked the idea of duty being allowed to ruin lives, or of destructive family secrets.  This book is about the secrets of an elderly woman Grace, who recalls her life for a film-maker.  She worked as a servant for a wealthy family, and becomes privvy to a doomed love affair between one of two sisters, Hannah (who is married), and a friend (Robbie) of the girls' brother.  Robbies dies of an alleged suicide, and it doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure out what happened.<br /><br />Anyway, the book is a quick and easy read, and if you like this kind of gothic romance tale, then you are sure to enjoy House at Riverside.
630460288X|3.0|Demolition Man starring Sylvester Stallone and Wesley Snipes is pretty far out in terms of storyline and science fiction. Thank goodness for Sandra Bullock!

The gadgets and costumes keep this movie worth watching but otherwise than that, it's ultimately a film not to be taken to seriously. Good luck!
B000VLE3GA|5.0|[[ASIN:B000VLE3GA Mothership]] is probably the best value in music this year, along with NIN's [[ASIN:B0015FQZ94 Ghosts I - IV]].  Here you get 2 CDs, 24 tracks, and 140 minutes of a great cross section of the best of Led Zepelin.  There is also a special version that includes a live performance DVD, [[ASIN:B000VLE3IS Mothership 2CD/1DVD]].  Despite the qualms that some people have with yet another greatest hits release, the high quality re-masters and great value have won me over.<br /><br />Led Zepellin is unavoidable for classic rock fans, and why would you want to avoid them?  They are certainly one of the most influential and important groups of their era.  Some would argue they are *the* best.  Like a lot of people I already own much of the music on this release in several forms.  Believe me when I tell you, I do not believe in owning every single re-release by every artist.  However, this release is so amazing, I truly believe it's a must own for both newer (most likely younger) fans and die-hard Led-heads alike.<br /><br />For starters, there is the re-mastering of all these tracks spanning all the albums.

B000AP04FG|1.0|I happened to watch this movie on a transatlantic flight. If I had paid money to see it in a theater I would have asked for my money back.  The premise is clever but all else is totally stupid: bullets flying everywhere, someone hit by a car, things blowing up. Nobody gets hurt.  An unfortunate showcase for two \\"beautiful people\\".
B00192KCQ0|4.0|SOUND: This is my first review so please be gentle!  Alright so I was chilling in the closest CD store to my house, which 20 miles away because the internet ruined my life, and i was walking down the metal aisle looking some King Diamond CDs. Thats when my crusty, baggy eyes shifted to catch a glimpse of an atrocious looking CD by an artist known as Metallica. \\"What lame name for band\\" I thought to myself, but I decided I would give them a chance, you know, just in case they started in the 80s where you were allowed to have a god awful name and still get chicks. (I'm looking your way Kick Axe). Upon placing the disc into my walkman on my 20 mile march back home, my ears began bleeding. This record was TOO metal! I couldn't handle it, they brought the thrash like johnny brought the cash. I was short of breath within the first few seconds of the first track. \\"Who the hell is this band?!\\" I yelled. As soon as I got home I ran to my computer to write this review to make sure the world knew who this underground band was. They needed a label and FAST!    LYRICS: The lyrics were pretty scarring to my liver, yet the vocals laid over the music so smoothly like a steak laying over a charcoal grill on a cool afternoon. I'm really glad they got mustaine back to sing on this record his voice is sounding better than ever and the imagery in every song is like watching the mortal kombat movie for the first time, PURE ECSTASY. I also really enjoyed the King Diamond like vocals on track 7 before the solo. They rocked, and at one point, maybe 3/4 through, they also achieved rolling along with rocking. Ecxellent job. Oh and Lars Ulrich did a great job singing on track 3.    OVERALL: I would have to say, as this is Metallica's third release, they are definately only getting better from here. After countless line up changes and the tragic loss of Mike Patton from hemroids, I would have to say this band has pulled through amazingly. Maybe one day they will even be out there supporting tours for U2 and Gwar. The most impressive song on the album is definately Cyanide. I still don't understand how they can play that riff THAT many times throughout the song! The endurance of these teenagers is extravagant!! I absolutely love a lot of the guitar work on this album, especially the solos that are all like weedooweedoodoodillydallwaaaarrrrhhghhhwewewewewewewedoooooo  ooo, and the heavy riffs backing them up. The only thing I disliked was how much they sounded like Black Tide. Metallica really needs to work on finding their own sound before those warriors of time catch them with a lawsuit of some sort. If this album were stolen I probably would not go buy another copy. Instead I would get on my harley and find my trusty pick axe, find the guy who did steal the CD and record myself breaking his skull open and and eating his own brains. That way I would have my CD back and a CD thats almost half as brutal as Death Magnetic. Thanks for keeping it Metallica, stay heavy and Up the Irons!.  ..m/
0340818867|5.0|Although international industry analyst firms aim to use similar methods when writing their research, winning sales recommendations still means connecting with the `go-to' analysts in national markets. I tend to recommend Kate Fox's book, Watching the English, to those trying to cross the cultural divide when briefing industry analysts here.    Fox is an Oxford-based anthopologist who is better known for her studies of English behavior at the race course and in the pub. It is popularly written, well structured and thoroughly researched. Fox goes deeper than the usual observations about Britain being, like Japan and France, a rather high context culture. She picks up three sets of attributes which might especially hamper those from low context cultures, like the US and Germany, who try to build rapport with analysts in the UK.       1. Reflexes in British culture include humor, moderation and hypocrisy. The first two are easier to work around. Humor is always on, even in rather formal business settings, and most interactions will be peppered with tepid humorous gambits: it's quite unlike most other cultures. Moderation is also an obstacle: paradigm changes are seen as risky rather than bold; what is new is often untested. Hypocrisy is a key element of our `negative politeness', in which not making the other person uncomfortable is often more important than being honest.     2. The general outlook is empirical, and therefore seeks facts, proof and experience. Eeyore, Winnie the Pooh's downcast friend, is a role model when it comes to the pessimistic and doom-laden scepticism of many English folks: perfectly confident projections of the future tend to be discounted. Class consciousness pervades organisations. Especially in London, many cosmopolitian organisations might be staffed largely, or even principally, by foreigners. Even in those businesses, an invisible pecking order will exist the classify the English (and a few French, who meritocracy provides metadata for mapping on to British class structures).     3. The English value fair play, courtesy and modesty. Aggressive, winner-take-all, attitudes are often seen as blinkered, comic and dangerous. Courtesy is a major flaw of many visiting business people, especially in their assumption of hierarchies in analyst firms: I often see spokesmen ignoring women and younger analysts and addressing their comments to only the analyst they feel is most senior. Modesty is also likely to give rise to misunderstandings: because no-one likes a show off, the tendency here is to underplay one's hand with irony. One might say that one `knows a little about semiconductors', which could easily mean that the person is a leading authority on the subject. In the US, business people often open conversations by dropping names and terms to locate each other on a pecking order; because English analysts will often not spar in this way, and do not feel obliged to show what they know, US spokespeople might leave a meeting with a highly able analyst still unaware of that analyst's knowledge and perceptions.
B000QXDED6|2.0|I haven't read the graphic novel so this review is based solely on the presentation of the movie.<br /><br />The Spartans of Greece want to keep to their ways, keep their freedom and land and way of life without the interference of the Persians.  But here come the Persians anyway.  After told by the wise men and the Oracle (consisting of lepers and a drunken adolescent girl) that there would be no war, the King of Sparta \\"takes a walk\\" with 300 of his finest warriors \\"as bodyguards\\".  They head north, to where the Persian army approaches.  A battle ensues, 300 men against an army of tens of thousands.  This is the plot.<br /><br />This is why it doesn't work.  While visually appealing, there's nothing else left to hold up the movie; no script or direction or acting.  The film is overloaded with unnecessary slow motion action scenes.  This allows for adequate display of the eye candy (the main reason for the movie).  Lots of muscle men running around in loincloths, and scantily clad women romping in Xerxes little parlor of sin.  '300' could easily take over the movie 'Spartacus' as the chosen film for parlor entertainment of the visually appealing kind.<br /><br />If the Spartans were Greek, why did I keep detecting a bit of Scottish accents there?  Why wasn't Sean Connery invited along?  There were too many unnecessary buffalo shots.  The timeline was ruined by modern style facial piercings and inappropriately added modern music into an otherwise non-modern soundtrack.  Even the actors who have proven themselves in other roles, such as Dominick West, all seemed to have taken acting lessons from William Shatner to give their performances in this film.  Some of the scenes have the surreal feel of a Calvin Kline add.<br /><br />The only way to watch this movie is with the sound off and some good music on the stereo.  A little weed wouldn't hurt either.  Why two stars instead of just one?  For the photography, which is actually quite well done.  Rent, don't buy.
0780619951|4.0|I found this version of TIODRM pretty entertaining.  However, I wasn't quite sure why this film got made.  On the surface, it didn't appear to add much to the story that is really new or original.  In the final analysis, it seems to have provided both Brando and Kilmer with a perfect vehicle to ham it up.  Brando put a pretty good spin on the character of the brilliant scientist gone way off the deep end--he appears to be playing the good Doctor as a flamboyant homosexual. But Val Kilmer is great as his burned out assistant who is slowly losing his grip on reality.  In fact, I suspect the only reason Kilmer did this film is because it afforded him a chance to not only work with Brando, but to get away with parodying him on screen while getting paid for it.  All in all, worth a look.
0385340990|4.0|Although this book took a chapter or two to get into, once you're into it, you're likely to want to read it straight through.  It takes you back vividly to a time and place -- the Guernsey islands, located between England and France, and their occupation by the Nazis during World War II. I could imagine myself right there and wanted to 1) go visit the islands on my next vacation and 2) read up about the history of the German occupation of Guernsey.  You actually learn quite a lot in this novel, however, and for those who don't enjoy reading history, a strong plot is a good enough reason to read this book.<br /><br />The story involves a Juliet, a popular writer living in London not long after then end of the Second World War.  She's committed to a publisher to write a book but has no ideas what to write about.  Juliet has been writing a newspaper column, and as a result, receives a letter from someone in Guernsey.<br /><br />She writes back, and that begins a correspondence with several islanders that leads to her decision to write her next book about events in Guernsey during the war. She moves there and quickly becomes accepted by a group of islanders who serve as her informants about this time. A story unfolds about a somewhat controversial young woman and what happened to her during the German occupation.<br /><br />I actually read this book about a month ago, but the story is still vivid in my mind, which is more than you can say for a lot of books! The characterization was very well done, and the strong story line is absorbing. I think a book club would have a great time discussing this book, and few if any would complain about the choice.  I will say that I suspect that more women would enjoy this book than men, perhaps because the main characters are women and there's a lot of romance and interpersonal relationships.  In other words, it's not your typical war story!<br /><br />Actually, thinking about the book, I'd like to change my rating to five stars, but the software doesn't seem to be letting me do that.the software doesn't seem to be letting me do that.
B00000JPYQ|5.0|UFO has to be one of the most underrated rock bands ever, and has certainly been undeservedly neglected on FM stations. This is as good a live album as you will ever hear. The band is tight, and Schenker delivers some blistering guitar work. All their great tunes are on this album. I disagree with JAYMZ \\"Old Rocker\\". I like AC/DC and the Scorpions well enough but they pretty much play the same type of stuff over and over. I would say that UFO's music from this period is far more varied and creative. I would say some of it even borders on prog (Let it Roll, Love to Love). If you are a fan 70's era rock you will love this.
0140143505|5.0|84 Charing Cross Road is a great read!  The premis simple, but the characters are full and rich.  Worth reading again, even if you have seen the movie.

B00003CX8N|5.0|84 Charing Cross Road is a wonderful movie.  Set in time when people actually wrote letters and developed relationships, with out \\"hooking up\\"!  Delightful to see the characters younger than now, but yet very talented. Worth watching many times... - Donna
B00104W8T6|5.0|I like this soundtrack.  It's unique and fun to listen to.  Many of the songs written are very political, yet still interesting.
B000U1ZV8K|1.0|First, to me seem an excellent idea to have 4 of my favorites films in one box, but was a sad thing that when i received this item was duplicate one disc (lethal weapon 1 and 2), doesn´t contain the second cd of lethal weapon 3 and 4. Very dissapointed of this item, even now i can´t get my money back.    please check other options...
B000B7TLT8|5.0|One of the best movies of all time. Any format I can get this in I do. I.E. VHS, DVD UMD...
1591840562|5.0|Excellent book! I just finished the first reading/watching of \\"the Art of the Start\\" and it gave me so many deja  vu's and many \\"Yes! Finally someone said it in clear text!\\". I wish the book had been around in the late 90's.
B00192KCQ0|5.0|Well they are finally back online with the music they started with. The past few CDs were all sub par and made me wonder if they still had the UFF! in them...  Well they do!  This one rocks and has restored thier heavy name!    Long Live METALLICA!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
031606792X|4.0|*Spoilers in this review*  Like all book series, the ending always faces the most criticism.  I was most disappointed with \\"New Moon\\" which I found to depressing and slow to enjoy. \\"Eclipse\\" was wonderful and I think \\"Breaking Dawn\\" was also great.  1. I find it funny that so many people feel it was too \\"happy\\" of an ending. How much more suffering do people want Bella to have? From being an insecure klutz to losing the love of her life in book 2, to destroying her best friend for most of the books, to dying during a painful childbirth, to suffering intense pain during her transition into a vampire.  2. Doesn't she deserve happiness? Even if it is a baby and early marriage, (something most of today's society knows usually leads to divorce in these times), this is a FANTASY book.  Let us have fantasy. 3.  I am so appreciative that Stephanie didn't go the USUAL root of today's movies, TV shows and books. With intense violence.  How amazing to have a book that shows even (Creatures like vampires) can come to an agreement/ can solve a war with conversation. If only this could be the reality. 4. And how great that Bella's special gift is protection. Something women/ especially mothers find to be the greatest power to have. To protect the ones you love.  This book had great twists and kept within the fantasy genre.  I truly enjoyed this book. It isn't as great as Twilight. But I still enjoyed it!
031606792X|1.0|The book was very disappointing.  I like all the readers loved Twilight.  The third book was starting to go down and this book really took a dive.  The story just dragged on and on about whiny Bella and her baby.  The author should have stopped with her third book.
B00192KCQ0|4.0|I loved this album, so much better than St. Anger without the horrible snare drum and sounds that were just all over the place. Death Magnetic is Metallica striking back to their roots. It at times has tones of their past album styles yet it competely new and worth the purchase, especially right now for $10.    One warning though.. the CD is mastered horrible. Terribly overload at points where it peaks and gets faster and furious. If your touchy with your music, a audiophile, be warned this CD may make you upset. I suggest buying the CD if you want to be legal and then searching the internet for the Guitar Hero rips which are 10x clear and don't run into the peeking issue that the CD has.
B00192KCQ0|3.0|Death Magnetic is better than the bafflingly bad St. Anger. But it's an album of songs with great starts or great moments, but ultimately destroyed songwriting in the name of being hardcore. Metallica seems to think that they sounded like they had ADD back in their hey day, because every song on this album is in constant confusion. Rather than actually writing songs they write snippets and comma splice them together with brainless drum flourishes and ineffective staccato riffs. The best song is easily 'Suicide and Redemption' because it does away with all of the above, as well as Hetfield's inane lyrics, and just plays the damn song.     And what is with James Hetfield's vocals? The man can sing terrifically, but not the way he does here. His growling vocals attempt to hearken back to his earlier vocal performances, but instead of sound hardcore just sound geriatric. The one time he sounds like a competent singer is when he lets up on 'End of the Line' towards the end of the song. His gritty singing voice deprives him of the range his normal singing voice has, and he can't seem to get the two too work in tandem as he did when he was younger.     There's plenty of thrashbands out there that have kept up their act longer than Metallica, and Metallica, like ex-death band Therion, changed and evolved into something wholly unique. Then they just lost their way somewhere between Load and Re-Load. I like Re-Load a lot, but it's the album where a lot of their current music writing practices started becoming a problem for me. They just sound confused now, like they don't even know how to write music and are doing so because they don't know what else to do.     Metallica still has it in them to write compelling music. 'The Day that Never Comes' hooks me everytime, but once the song gets going I just think \\"what is this crap?\\" It doesn't feel like it has any direction or bravado or anything. It's a hollow shell of emotion. It's worse than being bad, it's mediocre. The last album of theirs where I think they were on top of everything was 'S&M'. You can't put on a show like that and not care about it or be uncertain. They went out and just played the damn song. I wish they'd do that here.
B000B8QG0O|5.0|The movie itself is one of the best CG animated ever made. The delivery of the product was amazingly fast and brand new, as described. Great seller.
B000PFU7OO|5.0|A fun CD. Brings back the images of the movie. Gave it to my husband because he loved the movie, so he plays it all the time.
B00005JPO1|1.0|What a mess this movie was. Good to see Indy again but you can tell from the start that Lucas had approval over this script after rumors he threw out so many better scripts out the window (Frank Durapont anyone?).<br />Indy surviving nuclear blasts, Rodents coming up from the ground and grinning at the camera, Shia LaBouf swinging from vines in a jungle with Monkeys and hardly any Marion. She barely has anything to say.<br />Then you get the ending which comes out of a different movie.<br />Suspending Disbelief is one thing but you gotta check your brain and taste at the door for this one.<br />Lets hope they don't make any spinoffs with Indy's kid.
B001FEA9QU|5.0|Day one, bought and listened to the album.... Day two, woke up with a sore neck.... I LOVE METALLICA! I am 33 and I've been rocking to them for 2 DECADES. I have supported them through every album, and I've enjoyed every album. However, it has been since the \\"Black\\" album that I could really sit and ENJOY every song. Death Magnetic is raw, heavy, loud, untamed, long, metal to the end and plain out f**king awesome!!!!!! I can't wait to see them in concert again.     I've read some complaints about sound quality... I have no issues with sound quality other than I can't get it LOUD ENOUGH!!!!!! But that is my ipods fault, not the sound. LOL     I've also read some reviews that said \\"The day that never comes\\" was \\"popish\\" wtf?! Popish? Are you crazy? This is a pure metal album. If you LOVE METALLICA AND ARE A METALLICA FAN , you'll LOVE this album. If you don't love this album... Maybe it's time to rethink your \\"taste\\" in music and really decide if you are a TRUE FAN or someone that jumped on the Metallica band wagon when the \\"Black\\" hit with such popularity...
B000K6QIQO|5.0|This D is fantastic. I have Hey Jude on the original vinyl and have looked for it on CD for a long while. It is one of my favorite albums and I have always been told I could not get it on CD. The quality is the best. Get one yourself, you won't regret it!!!
159102594X|4.0|I had to dig quite deeply in a pile of praise before I could get my hands on The Blade Itself, Joe Abercrombie's debut fantasy novel in his debut fantasy trilogy. I had high expectations, both from critics and fellow fantasy enthusiasts, and while I can't exactly say I was blown away, I can't say that I was disappointed. The Blade Itself is an entertaining read that gives more than a few thrills, and is a great first work.     Despite some wonderfully imagined characters, Abercrombie seems to lose a hold of them for sake of the plot in some places. Areas which I felt should have been focused on were glossed over in lieu of snappy internal dialogue or sudden incomprehensible changes, while the reverse also remains true. In particular, the interaction between Collem West and Inquisitor Glokta near the end reeks of afterthought and poor execution; a previously bitter character has a sudden, bewildering change of heart, only to revert back to his former self within a few pages (it seems lost at the opening chapters of Before They Are Hanged). Otherwise, though, his characters are the heart of the story. Complex, dark and gray, Abercrombie is not afraid of showing true portraits of creations and letting the readers decide what to make of them, while at the same time making each one unique and likable.     The action is solid. Abercrombie concerns himself with realism - moments with characters outnumbered and surrounded hint at danger, and never is there a `clean' fight; wounds and blood abound, and no character escapes a bit of a pounding once in a while. That being said, the fights strike a balance between the predictable and the cliché, never quite falling off the deep end of super-heroic characters, but also never putting them into George R.R. Martin-like danger of being suddenly and brutally killed.     The overall plot is classic, but still remains fresh and unique, with Abercrombie's nose for sniffing out political turmoil really shining through in this volume. The Union in particular is well represented as a fetid organization nearing collapse from internal plots and counter-plots, the Old Empire to the west being forshadowed as the same, yet worse, and eventually the plot takes us to the North (where some of the most enjoyable scenes take place), where the Northmen under canny King Bethod grow bolder, and to the south, where fell armies surround Dogoska, a Union stronghold.  I didn't know what to think while I was reading it. I enjoyed it, but not nearly to the extent that I enjoyed The Lies of Locke Lamora or The Name of the Wind, both of which seemed to have been helmed by a writer less prone to rookie mistakes. So too, the world itself seems to lack the very distinct flavor and depth that both Rothfuss and Lynch bring to the table.    But Abercrombie has room to grow, and his is a book that should be well watered. An excellent debut that brings a new voice to the fantasy genre who I would like to see carve out a niche of his own. I recommend The Blade Itself with honest enthusiasm, and continue to read the series.
B00192KCQ0|3.0|I've been listening to this for a few days. Musically it is a mix between Kill em All, Ride the Lightening and Justice. With the best parts of each.   I was actually reluctant to tell my friends I had bought it, but it was worth the money. The lowest common denominator is James Hetfield's vocals. I don't necessarily mean that in a bad way, because he is stellar on the album, but he doesn't have the spirit he had on the former albums. I guess it's more like acting than singing - but he's a really good actor.   However, they have certainly redeemed themselves with this (as much as they ever can).
B00013RC8O|4.0|Like I said in my \\"Dirty Mary,Crazy Larry\\" review..a great 70's B movie made on a low budget,real \\"special\\" effects,fantastic stunts..it doesn't get much better..it may not appeal to everyone..but put big budget hollywood out of your head and enjoy..director Richard C. Sarafian had a vision for a great movie and in my opinion he delivers..I hadn't seen this in years..a lot of years..it is much better than I remember..deeper..it makes you think...if you like this one check out \\"Electra Glide in Blue\\"...The 70's was a great time for movies..give'em a chance...you may just like them.
B000002KNU|5.0|People picking up The Talking Head's debut album for the first time may be in for a surprise, especially if they're used to the eccentric experimentation of the \\"Remain In The Light\\" era, or the commercialized pop of the \\"Little Creatures\\" era.  Back in 1977, the Talking Heads were a punk band but mostly only in their ethics.  They played simple rock tunes but most of them lacked the raw energy of punk as played by the Ramones or Clash.  Indeed, much of the music here sounds like late 60s and early 70 pop rock.  What seperates these songs from post-psychedelic pop, however, is the lyrics and frantic atmosphere that would go on to characterise much of The Talking Head's music in the coming years.    David Byrne's singing style is paranoid and tense and the lyrics are as abstract and arty as any art-rock album.  In a way, this is art-rock brought done to a more pop like level.  This was also a proto-type for the New Wave sound that was beginning to appear around this time.  Songs like \\"Psycho Killer\\" have become early staples for the New Wave era and they also signaled the beginning of punk as being an art form rather than just a backlash against corporate rock.  New wave can be seen as the first form of punk where the music was more important than the attitude.    And that's what albums like this signify: A transistion of the popular music format.  Music always goes through transistions and albums, like this one, that aid in those transistions are often the best representations of the new genres that are created.  This was a beginning for The Talking Heads but it was also part of the beginning for the whole 80s new wave sound.  Though in some ways the influence out ranks the music, this is still a fun listen and an essential addition to a person's music collection.
B000FTWB7G|4.0|The first time i listened to this album i said what the crap is this. Then after a few weeks i decided to try and listen again, now i love this album and can't put it down. This album is practically Amy's diary with guitars and i love it. It is alot different from the first album so you can't really compare the two. I can't wait for the next one!!!!!!
0385340990|5.0|The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Society is a small gem in the ocean of literary works out there. It is a charming book filled with characters who evolve and become real through a variety of exchanged letters. The setting is Guernsey immediately after the German Occupation. The island  of Guernsey  rallies in ways that boggle the mind and heroes are  born from woodcutters, stonemasons,farmers and quiet countryfolk.A  reading society is formed on Guernsey to thwart the Germans. It is this Reading Society that takes on a major role in the story for it brings neighbors together in a wonderfully human and altruistic way. Reading becomes a force of coping with the effects of war and a catalyst for forming close and nurturing friendships. Books become a safe harbor and an inspiration to the residents of Guernsey who are suffering the deprivations and hardships of the occupation.  Into the mix comes Juliet, a writer from London, who becomes involved in the Potato Peel Society  though  a letter sent to her from a member  who finds her name in the flap of a book he is reading. Juliet is entranced by the Guernsey folk and she finds a new purpose for her own life as she begins writing a book to tell their story. There is such warmth in this tale of the strength of the human spirit. The characters are wise,compassionate, endearing,humorous and so likeable that you will fall under their spell and the spell cast by Guernsey, an island like no other.

0345495004|5.0|To put it simply, I absolutely LOVED Loving Frank. Nancy Horan is clearly a gifted writer in that she has a great command of the language but is also accessible to any reader. I couldn't put this book down. I knew very little of Frank Lloyd Wright and found myself searching the internet for photos of his architecture (it is frequently beautifully described in the book). No one in my all-female book club agreed with Mamah's decision to leave her children, but we all couldn't help but like her. Everyone said this is one of the best books our club has ever read in our nearly ten years! I love books that educate me AND entertain me. Loving Frank did both beautifully.
B00000IBDY|1.0|I purchased a copy of this from a cut out bin in 1981.  The poppy and trite music and lyrics have sadly remained with me.  I find their work to be predictable and devoid of any content - they were, in spite of Howe's presence, not particularly accomplished musicians.  Their lyrics were superficial and meaningless.  We coined a phrase for this sort of soft and vacuous music:  \\"twink.\\"  I regard it as a step below the cherry people.  if you are serious about your music, listen to serious music - there is a great deal of excellent psychedelic music out there - don't start here.
0307455874|5.0|I admit I became interested in Barack back in 04 like most people. This is the first book of his that I have read (I'm currently reading Dreams From My Father). He lays it out, covers every topic facing America today. My only slight gripe about this book was chapter 8 \\"The World Beyond Our Borders\\" where he goes into a mini American military history lesson but to appeal to the average person I can see why he added this to connect his points on diplomacy.
B000002LMK|5.0|I was only 20 years old when this record came out.  At the time, I was trying to be the best alternative rocker I could be.  Comming out of my Cure phase and into the early years of 90's sludge, I was wholly caught up in bands like Primus, Rollins Band, and the Pixies.  One of my buddies scored some tickets to the Ragged Glory Tour show at the Capital Center in DC.  Also on the ticket were Social Distortion and Sonic Youth...two of my favorite bands at the time, so I gladdly tagged along.  Sure, I was somewhat familiar with Neil Young, heard some of his songs, etc.  But at that time, he was nothing more than a legendary figure of classic rock in my mind.<br /><br />I watched gleefully while Social D belted out a quick set of punkabilly and Sonic Youth reduced the place to pure baffled silence.  My expectations for Neil Young were low, and I can remember talking to my buddy about leaving early.  Suddenly dozens of giant dummy speakers were lowered down to the stage and the lights brightened.  The band emerged with Neil front and center.  His appearance looked like something out of a Tim Burton movie - Levi's barely hanging on to his skinny legs, a tattered oversized flannel shirt, shoulders slumped forward, and hair that looked like a giant silver cobweb.  He picked up his guitar, gave a quick wave to the crowd, then ripped the place to shreds.  There's really no better way to describe it.<br /><br />I can still remember standing there in the middle of a giant steaming pile of rubble that was once the stadium, my jaw on the floor, feeling like I'd just witnessed the second coming of the Messiah, or who knows what else...and that I needed to pick myself up off the floor and learn how to walk all over again.<br /><br />I've been hooked ever since.
B00192KCQ0|5.0|Metallica's Death Magnetic is a breath of fresh air in the world of metal and is what most of us have been waiting for over the past decade. The band seems comfortable in their own skin again and the greatest part is that somewhere in the middle of Broken, Beat, and Scarred, you realize that you are listening to Metallica!!! Lars and James (and probably Rick Rubin) took the handcuffs off of Kirk Hammett and Metallica's greatest weapon was released with the vengeance of dog that had been tied up for 10 years. The music just rollicks through your speakers... this CD is fast, hard, brutal, AND musical. That is the wonder here. The band plays so tight that your realize that it takes incredible talent to make this record sound so frantic... each time you think the songs are just spiraling out of control, Lars, James, Kirk, and Robert, pull you back in, reconnect to the riff... and leave you exhausted! Death Magnetic is exactly what the a bunch of 40 something rockers should sound like... you get the feeling that the band likes this record and that if they could have heard it in 1983 that they would have liked it back then too! Anyone that wrote them off for dead because of the disappointing St. Anger should take another shot at Metallica and pick up this disc... More than a record, it is a formal declaration... We are still the biggest, baddest, fastest band in the world and to all of those bands that have tried to steal our sound and fill our shoes... We still do it better than you do! METALLICA RULES AGAIN /\\"\ I felt almost young again myself listening to this CD. Their best since Justice, and maybe better than Kill'em All.
B0011Z76RS|4.0|I love the fire and angst of this group. I am so sorry I did not pay attention to this group earlier but my generation was a little out of it by the time they hit. Anyway I am glad I bought it. I listen to it all: Pop, Jazz, R&B, Hip-Hop, Country. I have a well trained ear. Nothing escapes me anymore thanks to this sound. Amazing voice on lead singer.
B001DMJ9R4|5.0|This release simply shows what A7X is made of and how they throw it all to the fans in the concerts... in the cover of walk, M. shadows picks a fan from the crowd to sing the whole song... that was so cool, after wards they let him on stage for the rest of the show. The video quality is good and the sound kicks. This is A7X and how they give a good show. the bonus cd with b sides is really loud as well, cool covers and songs by them. Even the cover of Iron Maiden Flash of the blade A7X style, and let me tell you as a fan of IM, they really got it rocking there. If you are a fan and like city and self titled don't hesitate, this'll blow you away. For some back in the day fans they play second heartbeat and unholy confessions on the dvd. Really worth the buy!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

B000000ZGO|5.0|Exactly what I was looking for and the sound is great.  Great and quick service and excellent price.  Better bargains and more variety than local stores.  I will shop for more CD's on  Amazon.
B00005NTJK|4.0|Slowly I have been replacing all my original lps with current cd versions. A little dissappointed when I got this only to find the song 'Teacher' had been removed from the original place. Was excited about the extra tracks, but these included the (uk mix ) of 'Teacher'. I would have preferred to have BOTH versions.     Oh well.
B000P12LWY|5.0|This was the first time I'd ordered from Amazon.com.  I received the order very quickly.  It's exactly as described.  Good quality picture/sound.  Priced right.  Good experience, so I ordered some more DVDs from Amazon.com.

B000V86OKG|5.0|The characterization in Dexter always amazes me. I don't normally get into murder/cop dramas but the writers do a good job at character development and making you wonder how things are going to play out. Dexter Season 2 is as good if not better than Season 1. If you liked Season 1 then you will probably like Season 2.
B000NA2BEU|5.0|This season of veronica mars was soooo goood!  as per usual you see kristen bell as our teenage detective, solving a mystery an episode, but there is also the mystery that runs through the entire show, but unusually the mystery that runs through the show changes once or twice.

0743455967|4.0|When arguably the most popular living writer offers to share his thoughts on the process of writing, even the most casual amateur writer would do well to lend an ear.  Stephen King's macabre imagination has left indelible marks on the literary and cinematic landscape, but On Writing (which aptly describes itself as \\"a memoir of the craft) is a far quirkier addition to the prolific author's body of work.  In the modest book King conveys a deep love and admiration for the craft upon which he has made a living for more than thirty years, and his passion, bolstered by an accessible, informal tone, is incredibly contagious.        The book opens with an autobiographical section detailing King's development as a writer.  From publishing a neighborhood newspaper with his brother out of their basement to struggling to balance a family, a career and a drug habit, the vignettes from King's life fashion a rich and personal tapestry of artistic development.        The second half of the book contains a detailed exploration of the writer's \\"toolbox,\\" rife with carefully-selected and illustrative examples from both King's own experience and from a plethora of other literary sources.  At no point does King talk down to the reader, and the almost tangible sense of authority he conveys stems from his reputation and his enthusiasm, not from exclusive jargon.  For fans of Stephen King, On Writing is a brief but entertaining autobiography and for fans of writing it is a friendly--but by no means exhaustive--source of advice and inspiration.  On Writing belongs right next to Strunk and White's The Elements of Style on every writer's bookshelf.

1592802974|4.0|It has been very useful and important reading this book. I think every trader or the one who  wants to be it should read this series of interviews. I thought I was the only one who felt and experimented all the pain, doubt and all kind of experiences when trading but I see that even the great traders have felt the same in some moment. I see that is part of the process of learning although you never stop learning. A lot of tips and ways of trading are shown in this book that will be of great help for those who read the book. I strongly recommend it.
B00192KCQ0|5.0|I have noticed a little distortion on one song but nothing that would make the cd \\"unlistenable\\" by any means. All the complaints about James singing - don't be stupid people he ain't a singer in the first place this is metal. And the other person who said what's next \\"a cover's cd\\"- they already did that too sad that you ain't keeping track. Its kind of a blessing and a curse that Metallica was the only metal band that non-metal fans liked. And everyone making comparisons to other bands \\"comebacks\\" like Slayer's Christ illusion - what the hell was God hates us all - both good but give the edge to the latter. And Megadeth's United Abominations was just that - while The System Has Failed was better than it and came before it. And Elton John comparison is not even laughable. Lyrical content?? Again this is metal we're talking about - we're looking to get pumped not thoughtful here! I feel this cd does just that and does it well. Many tracks click in at 6 minutes plus and still feel like 3 minute songs and that isn't easy to do. Kirks solos shred all over the place like nothing before - IMHO.  And to say you liked it and hope the band quits now to go out on a high note - I don't agree with that at all. And God help me one more- Metallica ain't oldies music and never will be oldies I don't care which era of Metallica you are referring to.
B0015XASFS|2.0|Read great reviews on this, however, the majority of songs are not in English.  Even if I was biligual, it sounds as though he is singing in at least 4 different languages. While I don't object to songs in different languages, I prefer not to have almost an entire CD of songs I can't understand other than the melody. Probably will not play it very often, or maybe I will give it to someone who wants it.
B00005QZ7U|4.0|Moulin Rouge is a movie that you really can't \\"sort of like.\\" Either you do, or you don't. Warning: it can be taken to come off as a little corny, but as long as you can get past that...the movie is FABULOUS! The songs are \\"on point,\\" the acting is commendable, and the story...wow, well you'll just have to see the movie for yourself!
0316921173|5.0|Not many reviewers seem to have noticed that the first chapter of the book is the last chapter of the book, and hence the jest is infinite.

0439680093|5.0|Matt has been accused of committing a crime which actually he really didn't do. So now he has a choice to either go to jail or stay with an old lady named Mrs. Deverill in a remote area called Lesser Malling because of the government's new law called the LEAF Project. Matt should have chosen jail because he will soon find out that someone is planning something there at Lesser Malling, and Matt is in the middle of all the commotion.<br /><br />Matt's past hasn't been the best. His parents died in a car crash six years ago and he has been living with his mom's stepsister, who doesn't necessarily treat him very well. But Matt has discovered that he has some kind of weird magical power--but doesn't know what it is.<br /><br />When he gets to Mrs. Deverill's house he isn't treated in the best way possible. Even though he thinks the food is good he has to do chores and basically clean up all of Mrs. Deverill's property. After a while he has had enough of this bizarre nonsense and wants to leave, because this was supposed to be a volunteer act.<br /><br />But when he tries to take a bike out to the main road back to Greater Malling and then back to London, every road he takes just brings him back to the place he started from. Well, he went home after that, and thought that he'd try the next day.<br /><br />When coming back to the same spot, a guy named Tom Burgess appears and says he wants to help Matt out because this isn't a safe place to be. He also says that he will explain everything tomorrow at his farm, but what Matt doesn't know is that he will find Tom dead the next day.<br /><br />After Tom's death things got even worse. Mrs. Deverill starts to come out more strongly and everyone that tries to help him get out of this creepy place just ends up dead. Is Matt's new helper bound to turn up dead, too?<br /><br />Find out! Read the book.<br /><br />I think this book is incredible!! Once you start reading you can't stop! This book has a twist at every turn. I recommendthis book to anybody interested in books like the Harry Potter series--it's just so magnificent!!
B000BEZQ0Y|5.0|Wow...this CD is simply beautiful. Each piece reveals a bit of history of that time era, along with the events that happen in the movie. Fantastic movie and book, by the way...so naturally the music is just as delightful.
0307269752|5.0|Clearly one of the best mysteries/thrillers I've read in years (the other one that springs to mind is The Execption by Christian Jungersen,  which, oddly enough is also by a Scandinavian).Mikeal Blomkvist is a financial journalist who has just been convicted of libeling one of Sweden's movers and shakers, Hans-Erik Wennerstrom.  Wennerstrom retaliates by having his many friends and business concerns pull their advertising from Blomqvist's magazine.  Into this mess steps retired industrialist Henrik Vanger, who hits Blomqvist with an offer he pretty much can't refuse -- to move near Vanger's home base and investigate the dissappearance of Henrik's neice, Harriet Vanger, under the guise of writing the Vanger Family history.Blomqvist takes advantage of the offer because (1) it'll get him out of the media spotlight, (2) it will remove him form the magazine and hopefully restore reader/advertiser confidence so Millennium won't fold and (3) it'll pay the bills. Here's the catch: Harriet disappeared 37 years  ago, the case was thoroughly investigated at that time and now a lot of the suspects are probably dead.The book is incredibly well written and is the complete opposite of formulaic, which, being a rarity these days, is something to savor and enjoy (at least for a bit -- Larsson died in 2004, and although there are two more books in the series to come,  that's all there are). The characters are so well drawn you feel you know them -- I would recognize Lisbeth Salander, computer genius, even without the tattoos and piercings, I think. They react the way actual human beings might, and tend to do the unexpected, or the opposite of what you yourself might do.  That could be a drawback, but it works here.  The book feels more like something that might have really  happened instead of a well plotted mystery book.  The result, while we may wish certain parts had turned out differently, is supremely satisfying.
B0010AN7Y0|5.0|I LOVE THIS MOVIE!  I don't know why they took so long to put it on dvd but I'm sure glad they finally did.  I highly recommend this movie.  It is alternately hilarious, poignant and very clever.
0307455874|1.0|I bought this book to see what he thought and what he would do as president. I got nothing.  On top of it, it was a serious waste of time to read the book since there is no information in the book.  Buy a different book to make your decision.

B00005V3Z4|5.0|When my son brought this movie home, I thought it was going to be another predictable teen slasher. Not at all! This combination sci-fi/moody teen/drama-comedy/time paradox leaves you haunted, for all the questions left unanswered. The plot is indescribably complicated. You can't tell whether Donnie is hallucinating the giant evil bunny (a la Harvey) that tells him the world is going to end in 28 days, or whether you have joined him in a bizarre parallel world, where all the laws of science and the universe are warped, while others are living normal lives all around you. Is he seeing the future? Reliving his past? Or is it an alternative reality or a reversal of fate? Entwined within the plot are cutting condemnations of Society in the fat girl, the pyromaniac, stuck-up teachers, unyielding parents, snotty neighbors and self-help gurus. It all culminates in a fateful Halloween party. Unforgettable scores of '80s hits includes the theme, \\"Mad World.\\" The cast includes executive producer Drew Barrymore and Patrick Swayze. Like a nightmare, this movie will keep haunting your thoughts long afterward.
B00005K3OT|4.0|This movie is very good. The best part of the movie to me is when the minister says that we should think about what God is FOR rather than what He is AGAINST!  Very profound.  All of the scenes of chocolate making, stirring, serving, etc. are wonderful. The story is very good too.  Well worth watching and savoring!
B0000069CT|5.0|Karajan once told the strings of the Gewandhaus Orchestra: \\"Your sound is shining like old gold\\". Listen to this set and you will know what he meant. I bought it accidentally some years ago, and the recording of the first concerco soon became my favourite Bruch recording. This concerto is often played in a sweet and romantic way, which makes it unbearable sentimental. Masur and Accardo are playing it more dramatically than often heard, which gives the adagio a perfect balance and provides the first and third movement with new life. The other recordings are just as remarkable. I wonder if not the first movement of the second concerto or the notturno of the serenade are even more beautiful slow movements as the famous adagio from the first concerto?   There is another set from Philips, containing Bruchs 3 symphonies (number 2 far the best) plus Bruchs 4 remaining compositions for violin and orchestra. My best advice: Buy them both. Now.
0783233477|5.0|Well, if you aren't touched at least 65 minutes into the film (the hospital scene), I don't know when it'll hit you. Wow. Great performances by Anthony Hopkins as Bill Parrish and Brad Pitt, as Joe (Death) Black. Claire Forlani couldn't have been better cast for her part as Susan (Bill's daughter); a doctor in the hospital in which Joe makes an unscheduled visit. There's also a very touching scene between Bill (speaking of his late wife) and Joe, over a cold lamb sandwich.<br /><br />Jeffrey Tambor as Quince, and Marcia Gay Harden as Allison (\\"throwing the Birthday Party of the Century\\" - for her Dad, Bill) lend great support to this story of a man's soon-to-be demise from the world. And Jake Weber as Drew, the long-suffering boyfriend of Susan (and also the back-stabbing business partner of Bill), who really takes a mental pounding from Joe; which at times is hilarious. The second dinner scene with a slight confrontation between Drew and Joe may leave you in stitches.<br /><br />Thought-provoking lessons in living one's life to the fullest, by not taking for granted the little things we ignore while trying to go about \\"making a living\\" instead of \\"living life.\\" Okay, that was corny, but I had to say it. And don't forget your appreciation of peanut butter(?). Of course, you'll have to get used to \\"Death\\" kissing Susan. \\"Thank You\\" - \\"You're Welcome.\\"<br /><br />Love, friendship, family, trust, relations, allegiances. We should all go out in style, like Bill. And Mr. Joe Black was really an agent from the IRS. What a great movie. What an ending. \\"No Regrets\\"
B000LAZDQA|5.0|This term is so cliched, but to this film, it really applies: I've never seen anything quite like this movie.<br />\\"Shortbus\\" is a unique film that is about sex, yet more about everything else in our lives which connects to it. Writer-director John Cameron Mitchell did a beautiful job of guiding this tapestry of sexual pathos. Like porn, you see people engaging in sex; yet, it is more \\"humanly\\" tangible because we feel the genuine emotions coming from each sex act, not just \\"acting\\" or rather, mechanical sex.<br />How this film was assmbled is almost as interesting as the film itself: Actors helped craft the script as well as their own characters with Mitchell.<br />\\"Shortbus\\" is a sex club in New York; sort of a bohemian-like atmosphere in which, as one character describes, \\"people come here to use 'the motherboard of life' in order to find the right connections\\". Here, people from all walks of life gather to find something---whether through sex or deep conversation.<br />As the film progresses, we watch these characters intersect with one another, and help, solve, or simply listen to each other's life dysfunctions. Whether the characters are straight, gay, bi-sexual or transgendered, the labels do not matter---they are just people trying to relate to one another through the wonders of sex and love.<br />If you feel you'll be overwhelmed by the frank content, then don't watch. But I think you'll be compelled to by the sadness, honesty & compassion of the interweaving plots.
B00192KCQ0|1.0|2 songs...on this cd are decent and just that decent!!! Every song sounds the same no catchy riffs like the old Metallica, I felt confused as I got to the fourth song, Metallica stop trying to be some hardcore metal band go back to the Black album kind of music!!! terrible is all I  can say ....anyone want to buy my cd?????
0316548189|5.0|It was a great read. Anyone who is in any way interested in the history of South Africa or the life of one of the greatest figures of the 21st century should read this. This should be on the required reading list for anyone going to South Africa. It really paints a humble yet engrossing picture of the events that surrounded not only Nelson Mandela's life, but also essentially the collapse of the Apartheid system in South Africa. All the way from his early childhood until after the presidential election of 1994. The real amazing part is that a book so rich in political history and facts can also be an extremely interesting and well paced read for the average person.

B00005JOFQ|3.0|I had a feeling I wasn't going to like this movie.  I loved the cinematography and I thought Heath Ledger's performance was the most genuine, believable and less restrained out of the two.  Jake Gyeggenhal's performance seemed rehearsed and not from the heart.  It was the first time I noticed Heath Ledger was a very soulful person, I could tell by his performance.  The problem I had with the movie is the characters.  They both led double lives and were I'm assuming, \\"bisexual\\".  I live the gay lifestyle and let me tell you there is nothing worse than a man trying to come off as straight when he is totally gay, especially \\"cowboys\\"!  They knew what they really wanted, yet they deceived woman in the process and had kids no less.  I'm sorry but in my book, that's called BEING PHONY, and is also counter-productive for the gay community.  I don't care where they lived or what time this story took place in (the early 60's).  They could have moved to New York or West Hollywood, they had resources back then.  Don't tell me they didn't know anything about it, that's why the Jack character went all the way down to Mexico to get it.  He knew where to get it.  It's these type of people who ruin it for REAL homosexuals. they give us a bad name and they confuse everybody in the process.  It would have been better if Jack was the true homosexual instead of making them both bisexual.  I liked the story of \\"Boy's Don't Cry\\" better.  At least Hillary Swank's character knew what she wanted and went to no lenths to become a boy to avoid all this confusion and blurred lines of sexuality.  In my own oppinion, it's these white cowboys who need to stop playing games and represent.  Confused individuals are ironically back in the closet again and it's time for another generation to learn AGAIN how to love themselves and live their authentic lives.  It can be no other way.  The consequences of deceiving people about your lifestyle have great reprocussions later on in life as this movie demonstrates. Gay people need to be proud of who they are.
031606792X|5.0|=spoilers=  This book wraps up all loose ends perfectly. First of all it is aimed at 12+, which I feel is too young to begin with. There were plenty of adult themes in here, I think keeping it \\"happy\\" was a good thing. I didn't want to read about poor Jacob page after page. Yes the baby imprinting thing was strange, but whatever.   Should Bella have lost the baby?   Should they all be taken out at the end?   Maybe just a few?   Should Bella have killed her father?   Should we have to read for pages about Charlie agonizing over her leaving?   Once was enough thank you.   I don't want to read that in a romantic love story. There was enough angst in the first three.   Good old happiness is fine for me. If I want more \\"real life\\" things to read, I'll get the newspaper! Thanks Meyers for a nice escape from reality
B0015DYIH2|2.0|this book was written solely to tie up loose ends from the last three novels. there is no tension, no surprises, no unhappiness. everyone gets what they want. she could have used half the words to get us there. what really bothered me was how easy the choice was to become a vampire. there apparently was nothing to be missed about humanity. we should all go and become vampires. how one dimensional. she is capable of so much better writing if she can let go of 100pct happy endings.
B001CD6FKI|1.0|As brothers, Andrew and Larry Wachowski could not be more different but for the passion they share for seemingly combining filmmaking with gaming.  Often such differences in personalities will clash on-set, leaving a product that never quite finds its flow and instead feels like little skits, each directed in a different voice, but lumped together as one big work.  While their critical hit The Matrix was the first in a long line of morphed-genre works in which the boys walked a dangerous tightrope of style over substance, it managed to find its ground with a common theme and thesis.  Unfortunately their latest release, Speed Racer plummets down the green-screen induced abyss that is postmodern filmmaking, creating and unfortunate mess out of a classic piece of pop culture history from our childhoods.      Speed Racer gained acclaim when it was a cartoon, so it should have been comforting to see the Wachowskis tip their hats to the medium that made the franchise famous by incorporating some sequences that, although done with digital technology, felt drawn straight from an anime board.  When overlapping said images with their live action stars and stunts, though, the result felt too campy and cartoonish to be taken as seriously as the emotional storyline seemed to warrant.  Emile Hirsch is the hero and title character (with the budding young star Nicholas Elia playing him as elementary-aged), and the Wachowskis certainly didn't want to waste such raw talent, so they whipped up a convoluted tale of morality in a high speed sport.  All Speed has ever dreamed of is being a race car driver, like his older brother Rex (Scott Porter); his father (John Goodman) owns his own car servicing company, so there is no question he will go into the family business.  When Rex dies in a mysterious crash, Speed is not only competing against drivers who have been paid to take him out, too, but also the ghost of his fallen role model.  Add into the mix the rival company who wants to signSpeed, the question of whether Racer X (Matthew Fox) is really Rex, and the cheating, gambling, and fixing of races (even the Grand Prix!), and the result is a two and a half hour movie with so many characters that flit in and out (and often with bad accents) it's almost hard to keep track of who everyone is, let alone why we should care.  Oh yeah, and to keep with the original cartoon, Speed's girlfriend Trixie (Christina Richie), little brother (Paulie Litt), and pet Chimpanze (?) are along for the ride, too--though they do little but carry out a couple of funny sight gags.    It's hard to tell which brother was pushing for the more involved, emotional details and which was fighting for the \\"cool\\" graphics and motion sequences, but it's obvious that they couldn't come together with a compromise.  Speed Racer is entirely unbalanced: some scenes are so high-octane they hurt your eyes whether you are viewing them in high definition or not, while others drag in comparison with attempts and thoughtful and thought-provoking serious and sentimental moments.    The color scheme is so brightly neon, it as if there are fluorescent lights shining behind transparencies of people and objects and projecting false images.  Colors wipe the screen so quickly, it can be assumed the action is to simulate the speed of the cars, but the effect is simply psychedelic without cause.  The futuristic imagery tries too hard to one-up that of the original, but more importantly, the intensity of this dark tale falls flat because the actors are not allowed to explore the depth of their characters and situations but rather are thrown into absurd setting after even more absurd setting.   Ironically, despite the sensory overload of Speed Racer, the events that actually unfold are quite formulaic for this type of film, and by the time the Wachowski Brothers \\"officially\\" make their reveals, the audience has already been \\"in the know\\" for the better part of an hour.      The special features on theDVD release of Speed Racer include two oddly simple featurettes (when compared with the overblown quality of the feature film), and a digital copy of the film, which if chosen to download, actually costs extra.  \\"Speed Racer: Supercharged\\" is a standard \\"Making Of\\" behind-the-scenes look, and \\"Spritle in the Big Leagues\\" is behind-the-scenes specifically with Paulie Litt, who the producers seem to think will be the next Bob Newhart.    As if the bastardizations of Scooby Doo or The Flintstones as live action features weren't enough, the Wachowskis' Speed Racer is yet another to add to that DVD shelf--or better yet, to toss in the trash.

B000UJ48UO|5.0|There are not many movies worth purchasing again just because they're now available in Blu-Ray, but this is one of them.  The message of Kubrick's Vietnam War drama is more poignant when seen in all its original splendor.  Don't miss you chance to experience the haunting soundtrack and imerse yourself in a forgotten time of US history.  Who knew is was all shot in England!
B0016AJU2C|5.0|The sound on this album is different from most that Alanis has done so far, but it is also my favorite of all of her work.  I love the emotion expressed in the lyrics, especially \\"Straightjacket\\", \\"Torch\\", and \\"Incomplete\\".  I like that the songs move through different stages and I like that Alanis wrote in what she calls 'real time', it seems much more raw and real that way.
B00000FCBC|3.0|I like this album better than their early thrash albums like \\"Kill 'em all\\" and \\"Ride the lightning\\". \\"Garage Inc.\\" is itself a thrashy type album, but I just found the music more engaging than on those other albums. It doesn't have any great songs, like \\"Fade to black\\"-an all time classic song from \\"Ride the lightning\\"-but the songs are what I would call \\"listenable\\". Of their early albums, I think that \\"Master of puppets\\" is their best. The good songs on \\"Garage Inc.\\" aren't of that quality either, but hey, if you like heavy metal, \\"Garage Inc.\\" will please. There are lots of heavy metal type sound modules in it-that is, certain lead guitar type sounds, rhythm guitar sounds etc, which are classic 'heavy metal'.        From the first cd-which includes covers of songs by Black Sabbath and Nick Cave-my favourite songs are:    Whiskey in the jar-it's this song which got me interested in buying this compilation. There was an Australian radio station which had a listener poll of the top 2000 odd songs of all time, and this song made the cut. It's a cover of Thin Lizzy's version, from what I've heard. Not a big Thin Lizzy fan, so hats off to Metallica to doing something I can appreciate with this song.     Tuesday's gone-a respectful, bluesy, country ballad, for the most part. Has accoustic guitar, steel string accoustic guitar and it also features a harmonica. So, this album is not just purely aggro thrash metal...there's some stylistic variety to it.    The second cd is superior to the first, I think. My favourite songs from that are:    Am I evil-has occultish lyrics (I don't tend to associate Metallica with BS lyrics, but this compilation has the kind of lyrics which you associate with the dark side of metal...but not really to an extreme extent). The song has some baroque and intricate fast lead guitar work. The intro also has a Black Sabbath vibe to it, despite being a Diamond Head song originally.    Breadfan-the riff is similar to the one in that great Red Hot Chilli Peppers' song \\"Around the world\\". The Peppers song is newer though, I think, so maybe they've heard something like this song previously. There is a change of pace in this song which reminds me of Metallica's original instrumental \\"Orion\\".    So What?-this song is really in your face and a lot of fun. By a punk band I've never heard of before: \\"Anti-Nowhere League\\". The lyrics are relatively shocking, even now, so I suppose it would take courage for Metallica to sing this song nowadays! It has real punk rock attitude and the language to go with that. If you're a teenager, this is the song to either make sure your parents never hear you playing, or to play this song just to spite them.    Overall, the sound quality on this cd is excellent (in stark contrast to the sound quality on my favourite Metallica album, \\"Reload\\").  Occasionally a couple of songs don't sound very hi-fi, but it's not as bad as, say, The Moldy Peaches debut cd, which takes that lo-fi sound to a whole different level.    The booklet which comes with this cd has very lengthy notes on the compilation, and the picture of the band in cover band mode is good for a laugh too.     If you like thrash metal, punk rock, and the bass guitar, I think you will like this album.     Just a couple of notes I made on some songs from this album:    Last caress/Green Hell-a nihilistic punk song veering into a frantic thrash song. Has an out of whack version of Iron Maiden's intro to their all time classic song \\"Run to the hills\\" for the outro.    Damage case-the intro reminded me of Wolfmother's riff for \\"Woman\\". Wolfmother won a Grammy for heavy metal or something a couple of years ago, I think.    Too late, too late-reminded me a bit of AC/DC, guitar sound wise.    Anyway, here are some heavy metal albums I highly recommend and have reviewed here (most of them):    Metallica: Reload/Master of puppets/Self-titled    Coldseed: Completion makes the tragedy
0385340990|5.0|The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society by Mary Ann Shaffer has it all -- humor, sorrow, warmth and laughter. Juliet is a wonderful, multi-faceted character who has been through so much, yet has the ability to rise above it all with these letters and start a new life. As the correspondents write of their lives during the War beginning and ending, one wonders how any of them managed to survive such a horrible time. But through these letters, they found a lifeline in Juliet. Full of love, romance, laughter and tears, this book should be on your must-read list for the year.
B000X9NI5W|5.0|Burial is coming out of nowhere. He's publicity-shy, he's not touring and he concerns himself primarily with his beats. The palette is parsimonious: all is very sparse, but it never feels bare or cheap. Clearly, there are lots of influences here. Whereas the previous album was a nice crossover of dub, Drum & Bass, and Boards of Canada (!?), this one has an almost trance and garage feeling with eurotrash voices coming from another planet. There are echoing synthesizers that seem lifted from AFX Ambient Classic II and early Autechre (say, Garbage). The album is infectious and almost danceable (again, in a different planet). But the best thing about Burial is that his sound is instantly recognizable. It is original, honest. Given the intimate lyrics and melancholic mood, I would classify this as a Blues album for the next millenium.
B000NQRR1Q|3.0|So the Devil, having eternity to pass the time and no XBOX 360, got bored one night in 1666, thought it was fun to play a game by conjuring up a puzzle. Whoever solves this puzzle is granted the powers of a god.  You know, immortality, invincibility, ability to fly, walk on water, all that god stuff.  The keys to this puzzle are hidden in 3 books, in the form of 9 illustrated pages signed with Lucifer's initials, that when properly deciphered, unlocks the \\"ninth gate\\" to the ultimate \\"power-up\\".    Nobody is able to solve the puzzle until now, when book dealer/detective Johnny Depp is hired by a wealthy collector, who owns 1 of the 3 books, to compare his copy with the other 2 that belong to separate owners, located in Portugal and France.    Okay, nice concept. I was hooked. I was entertained. I was liking almost everything in this movie; the visuals, the creepy sometimes circusy soundtrack, the mystery woman, the performances by Depp & Langella. Everything except when I got to the ending, which left me going \\"Huh? What the hell? That's it? That's the end?\\". It feels incomplete, unsatisfying, anti-climactic.     And here's why. Here comes the spoiler.  For the main character he gets his reward -- he gets laid with a hot chick and this she-devil grants him the final key to ultimate power.  For the viewer, all the reward you get is to see Johnny Depp's back as he walks to the entrance of an old castle, gets engulfed by light and fades out. Man, that is SO LAME!  I expected something more dramatic than that. Remember that scene in the coolest movie of all time, Matrix Reloaded, when Neo finally reaches the doorway to the Source and engulfed by light? Imagine that the movie ended right there, without proceeding to the Architect scene & the saving of Trinity. That's how it feels. Well, okay the Architect scene was pretentious B.S. anyway, but that's another story.  The point is, it leaves you feeling hanging, feeling that there's something missing.    Hell, I'd even settle for a Michael Jackson Thriller type of ending with a shot of Johnny Depp grinning, demonic eyes glowing, with or without the maniacal Vincent Price laughing in the background. Just give me a more tangible, tactile way to express that he acquired some of the Devil's powers and I'm happy.  Other than that, I wouldn't mind watching this again.
031606792X|5.0|I ADORE all of the Twilight books, I've read them several times.  Breaking Dawn is a perfect ending and perfectly ties up all of the loose ends.      The story of Edward (sigh...) and Bella is beautiful and only gets better.  The twists that unfold in the book are shocking and interesting and totally unexpected.      Is it the best of the Twilight series?  It depends on your perspective, I suppose.  If you're concerned about the love story, then yes it is the best because it is a very happy ending.  If you're more concerned with the peaks and valleys of the story, then I'd say it is not the best.  Regardless of what you're interested in, all of these books are fantastic no matter how old you are.  I love them all and I really loved Breaking Dawn.

B00192KCQ0|5.0|This is the album that should have come after 'And Justice for All'.  This album forgives Metallica of the last 20 years of crap and brings back the true raw edge and long-winded thrash of Metallicas signature trademark.  It's rare these days that I am all that impressed with new albums from old bands, but this one really gave me the chills.  By song number two, I knew that there was possibly still some hope for Metallica and by the end of the album, I played it through again.  I hardly ever just sit and listen to an entire album, but this one really did it for me.  The only thing I didn't like were the guitar solos.  Sometimes they are great and very much like older metallica and other times they are just sort of there.  I was glad to see Metallica get rid of Bob Rock and his dorky production style and re-grip what it was that made Metallica...well...Metallica.  Once again, I would love to see a live show of theirs only because of this album.  If you're old school Metallica, don't hesitate to get this, you'll be plenty satisfied.  If you've liked the last 20 years of Metallica (Black, Load, Re-Load and the God-awful St. Anger) you might be disappointed.  It's heavy, it's raw and it's all Metallica!!  Thanks for the effort fellas, we've been waiting forever!

B00005JPY0|2.0|The Dark Knight is the sequel to director Christopher Nolan's outstanding and uplifting Batman Begins.  The depiction of the story in a gritty urban millieu gives it much greater gravitas than the standard superhero film. At times, it feels like one is watching a legal procedural drama like Law and Order. The Dark Knight acts chiefly as a showcase for the Joker character, played by the late Heath Ledger.  Ledger's performance is solid, but the other characters are ill-served by a script that places them firmly in supporting roles.  After awhile, the omnipotence (and omnipresence) of the Joker in this long film becomes truly annoying. He seems to be everywhere, planting hundreds of fifty-gallon drums of gasoline and fuses faster than Batman and the police can react.  The film also suffers the \\"two-villain syndrome\\" of most Batman features; attorney Harvey Dent is an integral part of the plot, but his Two-Face alter-ego is a late afterthought.  Two-Face's skeletal half-face is certain to traumatize impressionable children long afterwards. After the Joker has killed, corrupted, or defamed everyone in the film, one walks out of the theater numbly depressed; \\"Why did I pay to go through this?\\"  Good question.
B001B1UO6W|4.0|Child's Play exploits a nightmare that many of us have had: toys coming to life. The basic fear of supernatural evils commanding something as docile as a doll to commit murder may sound hokey, but director Tom Holland has crafted something genuinely creepy with Chucky, a now iconic 80's horror villain. Dated, but with above-average acting, superb animatronics, beautifully eerie cinematography that catches the wicked doll lifelessly resting in the backgrounds, and splendidly timed suspense, Child's Play is one of the most memorable horror films of them all.<br /><br />Six-year-old Andy Barclay (Alex Vincent) just wants a Good Guys doll for his birthday. So when his mother Karen (Catherine Hicks) is able to obtain one last-minute from a street peddler, Andy is ecstatic. But his new stuffed companion, named Chucky, isn't just a toy. Serial killer Charles Lee Ray (Brad Dourif) has mastered unspeakable voodoo, which enabled him to transfer his soul into the doll just before being dispatched by Officer Mike Norris (Chris Sarandon). When Andy's babysitter winds up dead, the clues point to the young child, but Karen knows her son is innocent. Chucky initially only reveals his true self to Andy, but as the bodies keep piling up, Mike and Karen begin to believe the boy's claims about the talking doll.<br /><br />Although horror films have long since surpassed Child's Play's gore and shock value, the suspense and anticipation that build up as the film progresses is done surprisingly well. Everyone thinks Andy is crazy, and Chucky doesn't reveal his abilities to the audience until a particularly terrifying moment when Karen discovers that Chucky has been operating without batteries. As Chucky's face twists into an unnatural grimace, our fears are confirmed. Perhaps what makes the possessed doll even more frightening is the excellent blend of animatronics and live action. Although the majority of the doll movements are governed by tiny robots, occasionally a little person will be inside of a Chucky costume, surrounded by oversized sets. Imagine the shock of seeing ultra-realistic movement coming from what was previously defined as a stiff-jointed puppet.<br /><br />Like all great movie villains, when you think they're finally dead, they're not. Comparable to The Terminator, Chucky is determined and nearly unstoppable. The \\"tough\\" cop Mike is constantly down for the count and it's up to a young boy and a frenzied woman to calculate the evil toy's demise. Some may be skeptical of a tiny doll's ability to wield death, but he uses strategy to compensate for his diminutive stature. Consider too, that no one suspects the inanimate object. A simply perfect character design for Chucky makes him fiendishly creepy, and as the film progresses, his features change drastically to accommodate scarier mouth movements, and murderous, sunken eyes. Chucky clearly captured the attention of millions, as four sequels were produced, all progressively and unfortunately more ridiculous.<br /><br />- Mike Massiehucky costume, surrounded by oversized sets.

B000003TAR|4.0|If not for the brief midsection of less then brilliant choices, In Utero could have been as immortal as most want it to be. As is, it remains nearly as resonant, innovative, and hard-hitting as first heard, the perfect counterpoint to a more polished major label debut.
B000002UR7|2.0|Another title to this review could've been 'Whoa!  Whoa...  Really not good. -at all'.<br /><br />Let me first state that Radiohead is one of my favorite bands.  I would give The Bends and OK Computer both five stars and the rest after them between three and four stars but this album is not really the Radiohead that I, and most everybody else, have come to know and love.<br /><br />Another reviewer said it best in his title to his review, \\"Doesn't really foreshadow the future greatness of the band\\".  And yet another reviewer said that \\"this could be anybody\\".  I couldn't agree more with both of those reviewer's statements.  Aside from track two (Creep) this album is nothing special and in my opinion is only worth having to complete a Radiohead collection.
B000002OK3|4.0|Tarentino's first soundtrack was just as eccentrically spot-on as any other he would continue to explore, though you could argue this one works as his most cohesive disc since they tied Wright's DJ character throughout the impressively obscure track list.
B00192KCQ0|4.0|As a longtime Metallica fan, I ordered this cd with mixed feelings and anticipation. I have been disappointed for a while, starting with the Black Album. Sure, there are some good songs on the Black Album, but it wasn't the Metallica I know and love. Death Magnetic goes a long way to restoring my confidence that Metallica can still bring it. This is the album that should have followed And Justice For All! If you love old school Metallica, you will love this album!<br /><br />My only complaint is with the quality of the recordings. It's not totally horrible, but you will notice a few issues. I see many others voice the same opinion, and apparently there are versions out there (Guitar Hero?) that do not suffer the same quality issues. So, that is the only reason I am giving this album a 4 instead of a 5. I would rather give it a 4.5, but that's not an option. Hopefully Metallica will hear the fans on this one and release a version with higher quality.
0761145613|4.0|I love this calender! The format makes it easy to read & stay on top of things. There are five columns alongside the day of the week. The weekend days have a colored background. Each box (for each day/person) will easily allow upto four lines of text. With one child, and two adults in our family, there' enough room to stay on track. On the downside, only abbreviated notes can be entered. No space for any details as space runs out. As always, Boynton's fun graphics & bright colors make it a very attractive record of mundane day to day activities.

THIS version is the widescreen transfer (yellow background) while the more available red and glittery version is not. This was a 2:35 to 1 film, and if you get the other full screen version you are missing half of the performances right off the top. Do yourself a favor and stay away from the more readily available red cover and grab this. Unless you enjoy losing half of your field of vision by \\"filling\\" the screen on an old-fashioned 4:3 out of date TV this is the one to buy.

0670451495|5.0|Make Way for the Ducklings by Robert McClosky has become a classic in children's literature since it was first published in 1941.  Children's books have changed a lot over the years, but this particular work is substantial proof that change is not always best and more importantly, that quality will always stand the test of time.<br /><br />The work has a lot going for it.  First there is the story.  Two Mallard ducks, Mr. and Mrs. Mallard are trying to find a safe home to start a family; one that is safe from foxes and turtles.  As they fly, several locations are considered and after a lengthy journey they settle upon a small island in the Charles River, Boston, Mass.  Before settling here and starting their brood, they visit the Public Garden in Boston, where at first the find food rather hard to find, but after they encounter the \\"Swan Boats\\" and the people riding these boats throwing peanuts to them, they decide that the park is a good place.  After checking the area out, the settle on the small island in the Charles River where Mrs. Mallard hatches a number of ducklings; eight in all.  At that time, Mr. Mallard decides to take a short trip to check the area out.  In his absence, Mrs. Mallard cares for her young and one day, after the little ones can walk, swim and learn to line up in a straight line, she takes them to the park.<br /><br />The story of the friendly policeman and his coworkers, the journey through the city and their eventual arrival at their new home makes for a wonderful tale.  Actual place names are used in the story and are depicted quite accurately in the illustrations.  Louisburg Square, Charles river, Mount Vernon Street, Beacon Hill, The Book Store and several others sites allow visitors to more or less trace the journey of the duck family.<br /><br />The second thing this story has is the marvelous art work.  All is done in charcoal, with wonderful shading and great detail.  The buildings, cars, people, dress and stores all are accurate to that particular era.  This does not distract from the story in the least, and indeed, adds to the charm.<br /><br />This is a wonderful read along book and is suitable for ages four through eight.  I have personally \\"kid checked\\" it with these age groups and get asked for many rereading.<br /><br />This book received the Caldecott medal in 1941 and it was well deserved.  Other children's books by this author include Lentil, Blueberries for Sal, One Morning in Maine and Time to Wonder.  All of these are excellent choices and should be included in any child's library.<br /><br />Don Blankenship<br />The OzarksThis does not distract from the story in the least, and indeed, adds to the charm.

B000MXPE7O|4.0|I would guess I'm not the only person to have trouble sorting out the twists and turns of a spy film's plot - the layers of betrayal, to be convincing enough to keep even veteran spies plausibly in doubt, have to be very confusing. As such, the morning after, I've got these questions.<br /><br />1) Is William Hurt's Phil Allen character, apparently based loosely on Allen Dulles, guilty of embezzling money? guilty of taking money from the Soviets? or merely guilty of financial indiscretions which make him susceptible to blackmail? Dulles' financial issues are an interesting footnote to history - that he and his brother as lawyers represented American firms deeply invested in Germany after World War I and remaining so in Nazi Germany but with several layers of financial secrecy through Swiss banks and business fronts - but there has been no suggestions that his loyalty was compromised.<br /><br />2)Who is Ulysses? Is he a KGB spymaster, or a highly placed KGB spy in the Western spy apparatus?<br /><br />3)Getting away from plot to character for a moment, Angelina Jolie's character, Wilson's wife Clover/Margaret, rings untrue in one way. She meets him as a wild, beautiful, rich girl. She's seemingly luring him into a sexual liaison because she's expected to find a husband from the right social class and feels pressed to do so with the war threatening to take most eligible men away. I have trouble translating her into the unhappy, drunk, passive wife and mother that lives uncomfortably with him for another 15 years after the war. Far more likely is the suggestion dangled early on when Wilson calls on the phone from occupied Berlin and hears his young son let slip that she's going out with someone, planting the suspicion in his mind that she's being unfaithful, and he retaliates by allowing himself to be drawn into a fling with his translator. The plot uses this to show that this was a onetime thing on her part, and meanwhile Wilson himself allows himself to be compromised when the translator turns out to be a Russian spy. But I would find it more convincing to believe that Clover isn't a girl to suffer the lack of male company for very long, and to have left him for another man by the war's end. I also can't see where the wild girl disappears to. This is unconvincing.<br /><br />4)I didn't realize until late in the movie that Wilson's Russian counterpart was not, himself, the (fake) defector. I'm not too good with faces. But I thought that was the basis for Wilson's trust in the defector.<br /><br />5)With the rapid crosscutting between scenes and time periods, and little change in Wilson's appearance to help signal the changes, I was initially confused over the thread - a hair? a violin string? an antenna? - found in the book, was found on his own desk or that of the (fake) defector whom Wilson in the adjoining scenes is confronting in the man's home late one night.<br /><br />6)I had some trouble separating out the fellow Bonesmen - the guy who talks Wilson into staying in Bones following the humiliating initiation scene and who Wilson follows up the ranks at the CIA, vs. Clover's brother who is killed in World War II, vs. the Senator (her father?), etc.<br /><br />7)Wilson's ethnic remark to Pesci's character, seemingly meant to be emblematic of WASP bigotry, isn't convincing. Pesci's Joey Prima mobster character is in Wilson's face a bit, busting his balls about his ethnicity. I just see the usually buttoned up Wilson letting loose for a moment to give it right back to him. The scene is still worthwhile dramatically, though, as Wilson gets to witness the close-knit nature of Prima's family, as Prima bickers with his daughter about taking good care of his grandchildren at the beach.<br /><br />8)At Yale, the word was that it was Scroll and Key, not Skull and Bones, that had the inside track at the State Department and the CIA.<br /><br />9)Some reviewers see Turturro's character as brutal. Only in one scene is he portrayed as slapping around someone during an interrogation, and the stakes are pretty high when he does. There is no groundwork to suggest that he has a brutal streak in his nature. I find his character's most important function as to highlight the unfair ethnic-class structure at the time. The character is older than Wilson at the outset and also a college graduate, but merely a noncom because he's Catholic and Italian.<br /><br />There were tons I loved about this movie. Its examination of the conflicting loyalties to country, family, school, secret society and job, and the toll this takes over a lifetime, is formidable. I think its period scenes of 1930s Yale and the Skull and Bones milieu are excellent. I think, however, that the book \\"The Company\\" (more than the TV miniseries based on it)does a better job covering the same material with the same themes while rendering it far less confusing.<br /><br />My questions about this are not a reflection of the film's flaws, rather of my own obtuseness and the film's subtlety.

B00192KCQ0|4.0|This album is by far their best work if not in 20 years, at least 17 years!  By no means is This a Ride The Lightining (still the best Metallica album period), but no way in heck is this St. Anus or the 2 Loads.    Guitar Solos: 5/5 (Good to see them back    Snare drum sound:  4/5 a MUCH imporvement over St. Anus    Productin:  2/5  This is one of the main reasons why I ranked it a 4 instead of a 5 star album, too much clipping.    Metalness:  5/5 see title of review.
B0012Q732O|1.0|I felt like this movie was trying to be an epic with it's scenary and story of generations and love and loss, but it was just empty. No where near enough real character development. I felt little attachment to any of the characters. My husband wanted to see this movie for months and he was so disappointed that he wanted our rental fee back. I'm so glad I didn't buy it for him.

B00192KCQ0|2.0|I was very disappointed in the new Metallica album, Death Magnetic.  What's happened to my Metallica, St. Anger wasn't that good either.  They seem to have tried so hard to either get back to their roots or do something different that it just came out crappy.  The songs don't flow, as soon as you get in to one beat/rythym in the song, it changes to another beat/rythym in the same song that just doesn't seem to transition, and it goes back and forth within the song, just bad.  Very, very disappointed Metallica fan, and I have every album, love everything up to and before St. Anger.  I'm truly shocked.
0316067601|5.0|Yes, this book MUST be read by all Americans. It is a true and factual account of freedom's fight and ultimate sacrifice. The events bring to view the lack of awareness of the effects of bad politically driven legislative policy by America's U.S. Congress centering of the rules of engagement during times of conflict. Each reader becomes a part of this human event as it unfolds revealing minute by minute the commitment, values, integrity and honor of America's warriors defending freedom.
B0018QCXGY|5.0|Like so many other monster fans, I was taken in by all the hype around Cloverfield.  I incorrectly predicted the monster's appearance based on a sketch, I correctly predicted that the movie wasn't about Cthulhu or Voltron, and then my son was born and I forgot about movies for a year.<br /><br />I finally saw it.  And man is it good.<br /><br />But you see, I'm a monster movie fan.  Cloverfield's marketing was intentionally minimalist, relying on viral marketing instead. One of the dangers of viral marketing is that it's viral, and thus doesn't necessarily distinguish by target market.  Indeed, the whole point of viral marketing is to get the word out to as many people as possible.  And many of those people aren't monster movie fans.<br /><br />Look.  This is a monster movie.  If you don't like the fact that attractive people run around screaming, maybe you shouldn't watch a movie about a giant monster.  If you don't like the shaky cam effect, maybe the preview gave a hint that the movie wasn't for you.  And if you don't like the unrealistic nature of characters running in high heels, people surviving horrible wounds, and the insane bravery/stupidity of the protagonist, perhaps you shouldn't see a movie about a giant monster that comes out of nowhere and rips the head off the Statue of Liberty.<br /><br />The joke's on us: Cloverfield is a love story cloaked in a monster movie. It's about the lengths our hero is willing to go to save his true love, a girl he's only just recently met.  In times of stress, our tenuous attachment to loved ones becomes all the more precious--if you lived in New York City during the 9/11 attacks, you knew that already.<br /><br />Stripping away the complaints about the genre, as a monster movie Cloverfield knocks it out of the park.  To Abrams' credit, it's just as scary as we feared.  Only now we have real reason to fear the impact of a colossal assault on our city.  The movie is filmed the way we experienced 9/11, and the floating papers and dust from the collapse of a building are a sign that we know exactly what a monstrous attack looks like.<br /><br />When 9/11 happened, I walked home from work.  I watched a cop stick his head out the driver's side window, so terrified of another attack from above that he was nearly drove off the road. Cloverfield invokes those fears: of confusion, of anarchy, of wanting to run but not knowing what's a safe place to run to anymore.  It is a monster movie made when the charm of monster movies can no longer be appreciated by the audience - we now know that if a giant monster attacked New York, evacuations would clog the streets, people would be poisoned by the debris, stock markets would crash, and worse.  It's not just about being afraid the monster will eat you.<br /><br />Cloverfield has its giant monster and lets it eat too: it's an immediate physical threat and a mysterious menace, far more frightening than anything the Godzilla remake could muster.  In the same way Godzilla evoked fears of the atom bomb, Cloverfield is 9/11 reimagined as a hideous, unexplained thing from beyond.  The film is also fearless in facing the monster (literally) and reinforcing the helplessness we all felt in the face of such a huge disaster.  Forget the boogeyman under your bed: it's hundreds of feet tall and smashing its way down your street.<br /><br />For monster movie fans, it doesn't get any better than this.lding are a sign that we know exactly what a monstrous attack looks like.

B00006RAKP|5.0|Like the title says Elton John always sings a good song.  I can't think of any song that he has sung that has been a dud.  He is one of a kind and truly a genius of his time.  He sings with great passion and his music is good to listen to when you are feeling up or down.  Don't get me wrong, he is not my favourite musican but one that always comes up with a hit. Greatest hits album? Why not take it through to 2008 because the hits just keep coming. Knowing what songs is on the CD helped me want to buy it because each one holds a special place in my heart for different reasons.  This CD will be in my collection forever because a legend is a legend. Want to know more about this CD or Elton John, then buy it! You will find out what I am talking about and you will be playing it over and over again.
B0019FOC5E|2.0|Remember how sometimes you find yourself in a situation where everyone seems to be raving about the 'latest rage' only you just can't 'get it'. Well, thats the case with this new CD and the effect it had on me. I like Abba, I guess. Like most people I know most of their tunes and some of them have aged quite well. But I don't own a single album by them, nor do they feature on my Ipod.<br /><br />Thats why \\"Mamma Mia\\" probably wasn't interesting to me. It sounded overproduced, overwrought, and whoever thought Meryl Streep singing these songs was a good idea needs a trip to the surgeon immediately. Meryl has always had a lovely voice (try her closing number in \\"Postcards from the Edge\\", and her stunning opener in \\"Death Becomes Her\\" - all in her own voice), but here she sounds awfully lifeless.<br /><br />In the end, all these tunes are like play-by-numbers faithful remakes of the originals, only with more production and far less charm. The young actress, Amanda Seyfried, has an especially horrendous singing voice. The mass-market quality of opening number \\"Honey Honey\\" is rather nerve-wracking, and my 'favorite' Abba track, if you can call it that - \\"Take a Chance on Me\\" was butchered further down in the tracklisting.<br /><br />Of course, I'm in the minority here. Most people love Abba, and I can see why this is getting rave reviews, but as a standalone CD for a non-Abba fan, there is hardly anything here that appealed to me. Just my two cents.
B000000OA6|5.0|The music CD was in top condition.  It was sent out to me before the alloted time.  I would purchase a CD from these folks again.
B001AJVR5M|2.0|Alright, so I put aside my prejudice for these new tween-pop acts, and listened to this entire album, and found myself bewildered by the obviously horrendous tastes that the current teenage public have. THIS is music according to them? I mean, even I have to admit that Miley Cyrus had a good single with \\"See You Again\\", but that song would have been a hit no matter who sang it.<br /><br />As someone who isn't interested in the Jonas Brothers like their target audience is, I can only judge them based on their musical output. Really, every song here sounds like a generic pop-rock tune - it actually reminded me of Hilary Duff's debut album \\"Metamorphosis\\", and not in a good way. One pointless guitar riff after the other, the moaning and groaning, the wistful sighs and \\"Oh Babys\\", and the mastery of 'romance' that they supposedly offer up in their lyrics. Aren't these people hooked on promise rings? If thats so, none of their sordid lyrics make any sense.<br /><br />\\"Burnin' Up\\" is supposedly the 'best thing' here, and if thats the best these three men can offer, its time to retire. I don't see a musical future for them, nor am I interested in any musical experiments they might come up with (solo careers included). What a waste. Its a pity that I actually downloaded this nonsense.<br /><br />Two Stars.
B0015YGA0Y|3.0|I went to 2 of Mana's concerts in Houston. Both times were just electric. While the video put me in the same atmosphere, I feel the song choice could have been a little better. Much of the album reminded me too much of the Mana en vivo album with much of the song selection coming from that album (el rey, vivir sin aire, rayando el sol, and donde jugaran los ninos (loved that one though)). I do wish they had a couple of Alex songs from the Amar es Combatir album as well as other big hits. Maybe even show the Alex solo from PR. If you didnt go to the concert and bought this DVD you're totally missing out on some of the best stuff. If they came out with a part 2 with some of the other songs, I know it would be better than part one. Even the Accesso Total had a better song selection. Im a hardcore Mana fan but this DVD and Live album kinda disappointed.
B00006AFUR|4.0|I didn't even know who Jared Leto was when I bought this album.  I bought it because I enjoyed the first single, entitled Capricorn (a brand new name), and I saw the band open up for Incubus in the fall of 2002.  My sister was the one who pointed out that Jared Leto was the guy who played the chick's boyfriend in that old as dirt My So Called Life show.  She also pointed out that the singer was the star of the now cult classic Requiem for a Dream.<br />The first two tracks of the album are the only songs that were released as singles.  As far as I know, they are the only two tracks that music videos were made out of.  They could of put out another one in another country or something, but I'm not sure.  The first two tracks aren't the best tracks on the entire record, but they are definitely two of the better tracks.  My other favorites include Buddha For Mary, The Mission, and my all time favorite, 93 Million Miles.  A whole bunch of people used to make fun of me for listening to these guys but I would still rock this CD on my system anyway.  They were the same people who would ridicule me for listening to Incubus's SCIENCE and the self entitled System of a Down record.  Later on down the road, they would also become fans of all three of the bands I just mentioned, but I was tired of listening to all three of them by then and had already moved on to bigger and maybe even better things.<br />Believe it or not, I actually enjoy this album more than the sophomore release entitled A Beautiful Lie.  This album sold only a few more than 100,000 copies!!  I can't believe it.<br />Oh, and if you enjoy this CD and feel as if you would like to listen to an album that bugs you out in that same kind of acid flashback kind of way, try 1999's Videodrone!  I have no idea how Videodrone never became popular considering that the album was put out in 1999 and had really great guest appearances from Korn's Jonathan Davis and Limp Bizkit's Fred Durst who were both really popular at that time.  It also had a guest appearance from the Cypress Hill inspired Psycho Realm.  I guess that wasn't enough to give it a good push but that album was never really marketed that well either.  Videodrone was on he same label as Orgy, Elementree.  They also fell of the map and they weren't even nearly as good so who knows what really happened.<br />But to make a long story short, 30 Seconds to Mars and Videodrone are two great albums to listen to if you want something to make you bug out for awhile.  End of story.<br />Sincerely, Robbydzwonar (AIM)It also had a guest appearance from the Cypress Hill inspired Psycho Realm.

B00192KCQ0|1.0|I -want- to like this album so much, but I can't. I just listened to the previews on iTunes, and this HAS to be the clippiest album to date. Especially on the bass drum.    Ok, let me back up here:    Back in the late 70s, when Engineers were designing the specification for audio CDs (now known as the \\"Red Book\\" standard because of its cover), they were going great. They made everything which was the de faco for digital audio up until the late 90s, but there was just one design flaw. One such design flaw which has been getting worse and worse as the years go by. This fatal flaw, which admittedly they couldn't imagine in their wildest nightmares, was the maximum loudness that CDs could handle. So, right now, you're thinking \\"Well what's wrong with that?\\" See, the problem is that most people like listening to music loudly. CDs can only be so loud too, and clips when it reaches the so called \\"brick wall\\" loudness limit that CDs can handle (I'll get to that later in my review).    In the late 80s/early 90s, the record companies completely dumped vinyl and ran wild with CD. This also meant they could run wild with how loud the music was without worrying about vinyl releases (vinyl, when the music gets too loud, is simply not playable). They started doing something called \\"dynamic compression\\", which makes it so that the drums are distorted, and everything else is louder. Therefor the drums get more lost in everything while being distorted. The level of distortion depends on how much the team behind the mix compresses the music, which wasn't really that bad until about 1994-1996. In that limbo period, the dynamic compression depended on who was involved in the mastering process (and to an extant, is still applicable today). The latest uncompressed CD that I have, which is NOT an audiophile release, is the 1996 remaster of the Saturday Night Life OST (which is kind of weird IMO).    There is also another huge problem: clipping. Clipping happens when the signal becomes -too- loud for CDs to handle, and the peak (or top & bottom of the sound wave) is cut off. Here's an example you can do to find out what I mean: Get a piece of paper, and a pencil. Draw one long wavy line across the paper, while once in a while making big waves that stand out from all of the others. Then take the eraser, and erase the tops & bottoms of the big waves at about the same level. Then draw strait lines across the gaps created, and they should connect the separated pieces. That's what clipping is.    Those strait lines are a kind of \\"click\\" that is created in the sound wave, and is becoming more noticeable as the years go by. I know some audiophiles will disagree with me, but clipping hasn't been that much of a problem. Until now, at least. I've had a pair of [[ASIN:B00001P4ZH Koss PortaPro headphones]] for almost a year now, and have not been able to pick up any clips on any recording (besides the infamous [[ASIN:B00000J7JO Californication]] and [[ASIN:B000002AP1 Raw Power]] masters) until Prince's Planet Earth (released 2007). Why? Because most clipping has only been a couple of samples long (aka a couple hundred milliseconds). Clicks that short can't even be reproduced unless you are willing to spend usually a $1000 or more on audio setups. Plus there's the fact that it's -slowly- getting louder over the years since the mid 90s. The mid 90s is the only time when the loudness level overall jumped dramatically.    But Death Magnetic must have the longest clips on any album ever made to date. That high pitched noise you hear on the drums (specifically on the bass drum) is not part of the drums set. That is a clip in the sound wave, reeking havoc on your ears.    So, is there anyway to decompress or de-clip music? The former, sadly, is a no, but the latter is a yes. There are such things as de-clipping software, but from what I've heard, a lot of the free ones aren't very good (they need to guess what the sound wave would be like de-clipped, and that's complected). The ones you pay for usually are a lot better at de-clipping than the free ones, but of course you need to PAY for those. Most people (including me) won't pay for de-clipping software. Also, don't ask me \\"what's the best de-clipping software?\\", because I haven't even bothered looking at de-clipping software. It's just never been a problem for me, up until now (and is still not that noticeable on some CDs released even this year, like Viva la Vida by Coldplay).    There are two paths we can take for CD mastering at this point. We can keep it at it's current level or reduce it, and keep most people happy.  Death Magnetic is the alternative future for digital music. This future, though, is one lost under a layer of distortion that ultimately ruins music.    Update: I was sent a message about my review, and it discredited me for using iTunes previews. He/She went even so far as to compare it to cassette, which is totally not true. Here's my response before anyone says anything here too:    \\"No, iTunes is not the digital equivalent to Cassette. The only processing they do is encode the audio to AAC @ 128 kbp/s (both for streaming previews & downloading). That is not the same kind of compression, and does not effect the post-processing effects done at the mixing studio. And don't use the \\"It's at 128 kbp/s !\\" argument either, because by this point (11 years after AAC was first drafted) encoders have gotten WAY better at determining what humans will and won't hear.\\"    Update 2: Some people I'm also getting messages from seem to not like me for not actually reviewing the songs on this album. The reason I didn't comment on the songs is because I didn't buy the album. I didn't buy the album because I don't want to support this kind of extremely bad mastering, and I don't pirate music unlike most people I know. I wouldn't have made this review in the first place if so many people didn't have trouble understanding what a lot of other people are upset about with this album. Like I stated above, clipping does not bother me most of the time, nor does dynamic compression (though I would obviously prefer it to be unclippy/uncompressed), but Death Magnetic is where I draw the line.    Death Magnetic seems like it would be a great album, and I'm sure it is, but I just can't stand listening to it.
B000Q66PXE|5.0|I was skeptical that this series would be in any way historically accurate, but it surprised me.  The general time-lines, major events, and most of the major characters are all true.  The producers took some liberties (as is to be expected) with a few of the main characters and some events, but it is overall pretty acurate.  Both seasons were interesting and grabbed my attention.  They are both pretty bloody and have a lot of sex scenes, but they do not detract from the plot.  I would recommend this to anyone who likes a good TV series or to anyone interested in history.

I got to page 399 out of 525 and just couldn't take it anymore, I put it down and haven't picked up back up and have no desire to pick it back up and finish it.  A story is only good if you actually get to the point without dragging it out.  I usually read books within 2-3 days but this book just irritated me by being long and drawn out.  The author was probably just trying to lengthen the book and filled pages upon pages of nothing worth while.  I give kudos to anyone who can finish this poor excuse of a book.
B000BYA5GO|1.0|Easily one of the worst movies ever. Subtle as a brick. If only weapons did not exist, it would be peace and love and sugar plum fairies all around, Ethan Hawke implies. Thankfully, this type of partisan message movie (Bush's fault!) has failed miserably the last few years. If you're seeking a leftie tirade, go for it. Otherwise, you'll hate yourself for spending a penny on this dog.

B001BPJJ9G|2.0|This film has some intensely brilliant imagery, quite astounding at times, but it's saddled with a lame story, VERY bad acting, hokiness, corniness, and very bad dialogue (which explains some of the bad acting).  I would love to say this is a great film, but it isn't.  The film has two stories, one story that revolves around a little girl and a depressed movie stuntman who is telling her an imaginary story about a rescue of a princess (which is where the gorgeous imagery comes into play).  It reminds me in a way of Tarsem's early film, The Cell, where there was some good imagery (in the dream sequences) surrounded by a lame story with lame dialogue and lame acting.  This film is better than The Cell (which was a pretty bad film), but this film wavers between solid boredom and beautiful images.  The hospital scenes are really dull, and while the \\"imaginary\\" story scenes are gorgeous to look at, the dialogue and wooden acting sink a lot of it.  Some of the film is unintentionally funny (I laughed a lot during the film), and quite a lot of the dialogue is expository, which is never a good sign.  The funniest part is at the end where we see footage of old silent movies (Harold Lloyd and Buster Keaton figure prominently), and that's actually the most delightful part of the film.  Tarsem (who co-wrote, produced, and directed) gets points for sheer ambition, but it's still not a good film.
B00192KCQ0|5.0|Finally, the wait is finally over.  Since the Black Album we've been waiting and not to sound too religious but we've been delivered.  This album sounds like tracks that were lost for years.  Its the Metallica that got me through the rough teenage years and set the mood for many many nights of self destruction lol.  I do notice that everything is overdrive out your a$$ though. Kind of a little bit disappointing.  But the music is great.  The music industry is to blame for cranking it all up.  Thank you Metallica.  I almost drifted into mainstream rock.  Thanks for pulling me back.  See you in Ohio in Nov.(driving from ky cause we dont have a venue big enough for ya).  If you're thinking about getting this cd get it.  If you're one of these kids who never heard the old stuff but like metallica's recent music, forget it.  Stick with St Anger.  This album is only for the fans that started in the beginning.

They went a lil haywire with the special effects but stayed very true the story of the book while the writers made it their own in ways. which is whats supposed to happen. if your not a fan of comic books you should be they are what makes a childhood worth having. well that and not having a job. Anyways i want to say thank you to the writers and director and to Mr. Downey for making a childhood dream of mine come true.
B00004STDN|4.0|It's been a dozen or more years since I last saw CLIFFHANGER, but on a whim the other night, I took a new look at it.  Boy, times have sure changed!    This exciting action-adventure was made before backgrounds could be computer generated.  I remember that when it came out, it seemed fresh, gritty and realistic.  Now it is painfully easy to see how many of the scenes are played against fake backgrounds made of Styrofoam, or worse yet, against blue screens.  When characters are flying in helicopters, we see that the landscapes outside the open doors are really just movies of mountains going by.  And yes, that is more distracting than I care to admit...I've become spoiled by the far more seamless effects that are possible today.  Chances are, you will be too.    But this does not make CLIFFHANGER a bad movie.  It's such a clear, simple story that it still works tremendously well.  In a nutshell...some bad-guys (led by John Lithgow...more on him later) cause a plan full of money to crash into a mountain range.  They go to recover the money and essentially force one \\"search and rescue\\" kind of guy (Michael Rooker) to track their money for them.  They are followed by Rooker's colleague (played by Sylvester Stallone), who knows that once these guys have their money, they will kill Rooker.  Stallone works to thwart their plans by killing the bad guys off one by one.      It's a simple enough story, but what elevates it is the enormously successful opening sequence of the film.  We see Rooker and his girlfriend have climbed a mountain and are now kind of stuck on their high precipice.  While Rooker is an experienced climber, his girlfriend is not out of her league.  So these two need a little rescuing of their own.  A helicopter with Stallone, HIS girlfriend (Janine Turner) and their boss (Ralph Waite) lands on a mountain-top across from them, and a robe is passed between the two spots.  Rooker easily slides across the space, not fearful of the mile-long plunge below him.But his girlfriend is understandably fearful, and Stallone persuades her to try the crossing.  She gets halfway across and then has trouble with her gear.  She is moments from death...so Stallone comes after her, and in a heartpounding, heartbreaking few moments, he is unable to save her...and she falls to her death.    In five minutes, we have established the main \\"good\\" guys, gotten us all well and truly to the edge of our seats, and created a dynamic between the two men that will haunt much of the rest of the film.  Stallone blames himself (and Rooker blames Stallone) for the death...even when we know that this woman had no business being up where she was, except that Rooker wanted to show off.      The film features many outstanding rock and mountain climbing sequences...and lots of snow.  No one ever seems to suffer from the cold...but other than that, it's a blunt, brutal, fast-paced film.  Each encounter between the good guys and bad guys is a little, exciting set-piece of its own.  The bad guys are a very typical cast-of-characters...frankly, they are taken almost directly from DIE HARD...a film which obviously greatly inspired CLIFFHANGER.  Stallone is like Bruce Willis' John McClane...capable of absorbing so much damage and still bouncing back.  However, Stallone is actually amazingly convincing in the role, both physically and as an actor.  He looks like a guy who could actually pull of the things he does...yet he plays it as a man unaccustomed to brutality.  He does what he does to save himself and his estranged friend.  As the movie progresses, he clearly comes to relish his role as \\"avenger\\"...particularly after Lithgow and his crew pull a particularly sneaky stunt on Ralph Waite.    The DIE HARD comparisons continue with Lithgow's performance.  He is clearly modeled on Alan Rickman's Hans Gruber from that film...and unfortunately, he comes across as nearly laughable.  His performance is so over-the-top and his accent so hard to pinpoint that Lithgow falls short of being a criminal mastermind, but mostly comes off as a petulant little boy.  A psychopathic little boy, to be sure, but he doesn't quite generate the chills he is clearly meant to.  I often like Lithgow...but sometimes his oddness and acting-style do NOT serve the movie.  Such is the case here.    Rooker is perfectly fine in his role, and he gets a couple of good fight scenes in himself.  As with Stallone, he's also believable as a mountain climber.   He's also a noble guy, and we really empathize with him throughout.  Janine Turner, popular at the time for \\"Northern Exposure\\", looks convincing too with her short hair...but is really given little to do.  Carolyn Goodall, as Lithgow's girlfriend, plays the villainous role more convincingly than Lithgow.  Ralph Waite is always a pleasure to see...he radiates warmth and kindness.      But director Renny Harlin stages the action sequences so well, and Stallone gives one of his three or four best performances...and that's what makes the film hold up today.  The effects are \\"old school,\\" but the solid filmmaking overcomes this.  (A few years ago, VERTICAL LIMIT, a similar movie with far superior effects came out.  It sure looked great...but it totally missed the boat on creating genuine excitement.)  I think today's audience might have a hard time accepting the cheese-factor of CLIFFHANGER...although if anyone can get through the opening scene without breaking a sweat, I'd be surprised.  So, despite its flaws, I'm very glad I went back and took another look at this minor action classic.
1591841666|5.0|I'm normally averse to those business advice books that state the obvious in far too many words. This isn't one of those books.    True, Godin tackles some allegedly self-evident insights on quitting (or not). But they're only self-evident when you take the time to think about them. Which we don't.    And only self-evident if you are \\"brave\\" enough to confront them and accept that just maybe you should be quitting more often. Most of us aren't that brave.    Godin writes eloquently and inspirationally. Reading the book means you finally face up to the obvious. And his words have a magical way of encouraging practical action. I know I sat down the day after reading the Dip and took some necessary decisions I'd been pushing aside for years.

I settled on the CD titled Come Away With Me ... which I just love.  Her voice is so comforting to listen to and I play it just about every day.  Now that I have one of her CD's I intend to purchase more.

B000V86OKG|5.0|Dexter Season 2 was even better than the first.  More plot lines that were all well-developed and of course an exciting last few episodes!  I haven't looked too much at the special features, but I know there are tv episodes from a couple other Showtime series as well.<br /><br />Overall, if you love Dexter you should own the second season on DVD.

B000AMJC2K|4.0|The mount holds my Samsung 2253LW 22inch widescreen (8 lbs)in portrait mode and it's great so I don't have to scroll web pages, emails, Word documents, Windows Explorer, iTunes, etc. anymore.  It's fully adjustable which is really nice; however, I would keep it in either portrait or landscape mode and keep it there rather than rotating back and forth because it's stiff.    I removed the middle arm because I don't need to extend it that long but one of the adjusting screw was really tight and I was able to do it but I don't think a mom or grandmother could do it (I'm a 39 year old male).  There's also grease when you take it apart so be careful not to get it on the carpet like me.    I got this because it has a desk clamp instead of just sitting on my desk as with the Neoflex LCD stand ($35) because I felt that a 22inch widescreen monitor in portrait mode is really tall and might accidentally fall forward or backward, especially with kids.
0307346617|2.0|I'm pretty big on sci-fi/apocalyptic genres, but this book just has a feel  of a childish comic book throughout. The main problem I will lament about is the character substance of the book. The book is written as if it were a compilation of interviews with key people during all phases of the zombie war. So since the story is told from the perspective of different characters along the way, you can imagine that this is pretty important.    Every character is puzzling because not only is each one a ridiculous over-dramatic stereotype (i.e. the Jewish character lamenting how the Arabs wanted to destroy the Jewish race, the Arab character discussing how he wanted nothing more than to destroy the Jewish race, the political insider overly concerned with an upcoming election instead of the impending Zombie threat, the pharmaceutical CEO feeling justified in lying to people regarding the effectiveness of his antidote, etc etc), but the reader will also sense that each character is introduced in the same writing style (although it is supposed to be the character's own words). This shows obvious limitations in both the author's command over the subtleties of character display and the author's imagination.     So yeah, go ahead and get it for your 12 year old cousin. But I would skip on buying it for anyone with a post-high school reading comprehension.
B000IOM1Z0|5.0|If much of Peter Gabriel's lasting artistic legacy will be the principled stands he has taken for the cause of human rights, then a similar legacy should linger long after Eric Woolfson for his insights into the human tragedies of gambling addiction.  While many superficial songs have been written on the subject, [[ASIN:B00049QNMG The Turn of a Friendly Card]] explores the excitement and disappointment, the folly and the wisdom that can sometimes come when there is [[ASIN:B0017SV3QO Nothing Left To Lose]].  That song, in particular, embodies an uplifting melody around starkly somber lyrics that together create a sense of quiet resignation, a singularly unique emotion not heard in many songs.  But as deeply as this concept album delves into these themes of mental addiction and the power of choice versus the unconscious, Woolfson delves even deeper in his musical GAMBLER where additionally the primal male fantasies of heroism are turned against the hero.  This album benefits from not only the stellar production and engineering of Alan Parsons, but also from two of the finest instrumentals Parsons has ever composed: [[ASIN:B0017SYRDU The Gold Bug]] and [[ASIN:B0017SSZ1K The Ace Of Swords]].<br /><br />If asked just what was The Alan Parsons Project, the simple answer would be a couple of musical geniuses who had the good sense to surround themselves with a bunch of other musical geniuses.  Even a casual interest in the liner notes will reveal the unique talents of Andrew Powell who was solely responsible for all of the Project's orchestral arrangements.  But far less obvious would be the tremendous contributions that guitarist Ian Bairnson made throughout the life of the Project in terms of arrangement and, all too often, extremely complicated key changes.  On [[ASIN:B0017T0FVW I Don't Wanna Go Home]] in particular, Bairnson places a single sheet of paper between the strings and the pickup of his guitar in order to achieve an almost unheard organic quality to his playing.  Even Chris Rainbow deserves much more praise for his \\"rainbow effect\\" vocal harmonies laden throughout The Project catalog and showcased on the bonus material [[ASIN:B0017SSYXO Nothing Left To Lose (Chris Rainbow Overdub Vocal Compilation)]].<br /><br />(Please be aware that there are three distinct versions of this album before making your purchase.  There is the recent SONY/BMG remaster that I personally recommend as it sounds the best to my ear, the inferior compact disc that ARISTA released in the mid-1980s, and the HDAD released by CLASSIC RECORDS.  Normally, CLASSIC RECORDS releases superior products, but I would only recommend the HDAD to those whose chief concern is dynamic range as this particular rendering has an enormous amount of tape hiss.

1400032717|3.0|I wish I had more appreciation for the writing in this novel but other than the unique idea of an autistic first person narrator, it's pretty dull going. I tired very early of the scientific preaching and eventually was disappointed by the unimaginative plot. The ending is a non-event. It resolves nothing but by that time, I no longer cared what happened to any of the characters. 3 stars for a unique approach.
B000VBJEEG|5.0|I WAS VERY  HAPPY I ORDERED THIS PRODUCT. IT  WAS  ENTERTAINING  FOR ADULTS AS WELL AS THE  YOUNGER CROWD. THANX TO PIXAR AGAIN..
B000002H6C|5.0|This is another masterpiece in their impressive catalog. This album includes what is probably my favorite Metallica song ever, which of course is \\"One\\". I don't know what it is about this track, but when that instrumental comes in, there isn't another song on the planet that gets me more pumped. If you are a runner like me it is definitely a great song to add to your running playlist. My other favorites are the title track, \\"...And Justice For All\\",  \\"Blackened\\", and \\"To Live Is To Die\\". Oh yeah and stop complaining about the production on this record. It sounds good in my car!
B000001GS3|5.0|Macbeth is my favorite opera.  I have been listening to various performances of Verdi's Macbeth, both live and recorded, for over thirty years, and this recording is the best.  Other recordings (I have 7 Macbeths) may have an equally strong Macbeth, Lady Macbeth, Banquo, Macduff, or conductor, and I will listen to them from time to time to single out a Callas, Scotto or Milnes. When I just want to hear the opera, this is the recording I come back to.  Only this recording has no weak links!
B000002H97|5.0|For most of the \\"Old School\\" Metallica fans this album was considered a huge disappointment. And widely considered the beginning of a huge downward spiral for the band. I will never begin to understand why? This album is yet another masterpiece for Metallica. So they slowed things down a bit. So what, This album is still better than 99% of the crap that's coming out nowadays. 15 million fans can't be wrong, Highest selling Metallica album EVER!
B000B5XOY8|1.0|Bought this to get the Prince videos and watched in horror as I discovered that they put a poorly edited version of the Partyman video and not the full version. If they ever do another special edition of Batman, they MUST include the real versions of the Prince videos and not crappy edits.
B00192KCQ0|5.0|i don't understand why people are so divided on this album. To the people that gave this release at least 4 stars, good for you. You are the true Metallica fans. To everyone else, you used to be fans. C'mon people these guys are in their mid-40's and they can still put out a better record than 99% of anything else coming out these days in the metal scene. Especially the American Metal scene.                    This comment is for all the people who wanted another one of those 80's records, If they were stuck in the past you wouldn't still be listening. In fact, most likely it would've gotten to the point where you would've said, \\"All their stuff sounds the same\\". A good example would be Dragonforce. They keep making albums where they are sticking to the same formula, and look what's happening. People are starting to lose interest. Hats off to Metallica for making the changes they did. Every step was a necessary step in their evolution as artists. And it led us all to this great masterpiece that is Death Magnetic. The true fans of Metallica will appreciate all the music they have put out. Of course we all have our own personal favorites and that's fine, but you haters need to give respect where respect is due! Besides how many other bands do you know that are still this big after 25 years?... Thought so!    Highlights include....Every song!
B00005K3O4|3.0|It's definitely not the smartest, or scariest b-movie ever, yet if you consider that this will be one of those you sit around with a bunch of friends to make fun of the corny effects, it's definitely an enjoyable watch.<br /><br />Saw this originally on either USA or HBO ages ago, and it definitely holds up years later to be one of the silliest premises ever for a \\"scary\\" movie.<br /><br />In line with Troma Troupe videos (will not buy those though) it's definitely one to watch only when you really want to see a good - BAD movie.
B000000OAH|5.0|Looking back at the 1970s, sometimes many forget how big the band Queen was. Even as Queen moved into the 1980s, while their popularity did slightly decline in the United States, it continued to be very high in Europe. Their performance at Live Aid is widely considered one of the greatest of all-time and their subsequent \\"Magic\\" tour is considered one of the all-time greatest concert tours. If it weren't for Freddie Mercury's death in 1992, we might still be talking about Queen being as big a band as the Beatles. When Queen released their 1973 self-titled debut album, it showed all of the signs of greatness to come.  By 1977, Queen would ascend into the upper echelon of Rock with their sixth album \\"News of the World\\".   This album would feature the monster hits of \\"We Will Rock You\\" and \\"We are the Champions\\".   However this album would offer so much more as it showed Queen as a band not afraid to innovate and explore new horizons.  Following up a such an effort is often not easy, but with the release of their seventh album, \\"Jazz\\" - Queen would undertake what might have been their most ambitious effort to date.  \\"Jazz\\" would showcase Queen's innovation like no other album they had done before that.  While many didn't consider \\"Jazz\\" to be up at the level of \\"News of the World\\" - I would whole-heartedly disagree - this album is a masterpiece.    Queen is an example of the sum of the parts actually being greater than the whole. However, if you take each of the four members of Queen, they easily stand on their own as a top musician in their profession. Freddie Mercury is easily known to be the emotional and flamboyant lead vocalist of Queen who indeed has a legendary voice. Brian May is the legendary lead guitarist and probably the second most popular member of the band. Roger Taylor and John Deacon go extremely underrated. Listen to Taylor's thundering drumming in the studio or live and one can easily understand why he was asked to participate in an All Star Drum Jam(The S.O.S. All-Stars) at the Live Earth concert. As for John Deacon, he might be one of music's all-time underrated bass players. Many of his bass lines have proven to be the foundation for Queen's musical sound. In addition to being top musicians, all four members play integral roles in the songwriting.      While the title of this album is \\"Jazz\\", Queen explores a multitude of musical styles, but Jazz isn't one of them.   On \\"News of the World\\", Queen opted for a more \\"stripped down\\" Rock sound.  On this album, we still Queen integrating different musical styles into their core sound.   The result is something special.  Here is a synopsis of the 13 original tracks:    \\"Mustapha\\": As the title indicates, this album has a Middle-Eastern feel to it.  Most of the lyrics were also done in Persian.   May and Deacon really help set the tempo with their guitar and bass work respectively.  Mercury does a great job with the Persian lyrics - especially has he raises his voice up some octave levels during the chorus midway through the song.    \\"Fat Bottomed Girls\\":  Legendary song by Queen.  May's guitar gives this song a Rock feel, while the combined harmonies of Mercury and May show a traditional Queen theatrical feel.  The line \\"Get on your bikes and ride\\" establishes some synergy with this track and the fourth one, \\"Bicycle Race\\".    \\"Jealousy\\": This is a ballad by the band that is highlighted by the piano and a simulated sitar sound.   Mercury shines on vocals, but when the background harmonies are needed by May and Taylor, they are spot on.    \\"Bicycle Race\\": Another masterpiece.   In general the chorus gives you a feel for pedaling on a bicycle.   I particularly like the tempo and melody changes.  Parts of the song have the classic theatrical sound.   The reference to \\"Fat Bottomed Girls\\" provides synergy back to the track with that name.    \\"If You Can't Beat Them\\": Great song written by Deacon.  While Deacon wrote this song, the big highlight is a two minute guitarsolo by May which is as good as any guitar solo I ever heard.    \\"Let Me Entertain You\\":  Deacon's bass work is spot on with this song, but I also give credit to May's guitars.  Great harmonies as well.  This song establishes synergy back to \\"Teo Torriate\\" on \\"A Day at the Races\\" with the reference to \\"We'll sing to you in Japanese\\".       \\"Dead on Time\\":  A similar tempo to \\"Keep Yourself Alive\\" from Queen's debut album, but with a more modern twist.  This song is simply Hall of Fame quality.  It's a complete effort by the band by ultimately its May who generates some powerful guitar riffs that shines.    \\"In Only Seven Days\\": This is a softer song by Deacon.  This song gives Mercury the opportunity to shine.  Not the best song on the collection, but not a bad one.    \\"Dreamers Ball\\": This is more of an acoustic song.  It almost sounds like a cross between ragtime and tropical island music providing for a unique and innovative sound.    \\"Fun It\\": This song has more of a dance beat to it.  Taylor takes the lead vocals and his higher octaves are perfect on this track.  It's a different sound for Queen, but I got used to it.    \\"Leaving Home Ain't Easy\\": May takes the lead vocals on this ballad.   Not a bad track at all.    \\"Don't Stop Me Now\\":  Legendary track with a classic Queen theatrical feel.  I love the tempo change from the soft intro.      \\"More of that Jazz\\": Underrated song by Queen.  Taylor takes the lead on vocals.  I particularly love the innovative montage of the other tracks on the song \\"Dead on Time\\", \\"Bicycle Race\\", \\"Mustapha\\", \\"If You Can't Beat Them\\", \\"Fun It\\", and \\"Fat Bottomed Girls\\".    Don't listen to the critics.  This is album is simply a masterpiece.  Definitely worth checking out.
B00151HZME|5.0|Please listen to me and ignore Metacritic on this one. If you search the three M83 albums it lists to date, this one ranks at the bottom with a composite score of 69. I have been following France's Anthony Gonzalez aka M83 for some time now, and I can definitely say that Saturdays=Youth is his finest album to date, and also one of the best of 2008. While his first two albums are both refreshing and disturbing sonic landscapes (I could appreciate them both, but neither was a particular favorite of mine), this latest album is an actual record that you can listen to while you're not doing anything else.<br /><br />There is something undescribable about this album that taps into my subconscious and somehow reminds me of what it was like to be a kid who grew up in the 80's. Apparently, Gonzalez is 26 (I am 27, born in 1980), so we must have seen some of the same flicks and listened to the same Top 40 countdowns. As usual, Pitchfork explains it best:<br /><br />\\"The album has the same nostalgic sparkle as Hughes' (John Hughes of Pretty in Pink/Breakfast Club/Ferris Bueller/Better of Dead fame) films, a soft-focused mythology of eternal summers and young love. In the liner notes, Gonzalez dedicates it to \\"all the friends, music, movies, joints, and crazy teachers that made my teenage years so great!\\" At 26, Gonzalez is just the right age to look back on this era with rose-tinted glasses, forgetting the alienation and anxiety, remembering only the sweetness. Whenever the darker side of teenhood rears its head, it's heroically battled back: On the shoegaze-thick \\"Dark Moves of Love\\", \\"everything is wrecked and grey,\\" but the song ends on a poignant note: \\"I will fight the time and bring you back!\\" On the album's cover, heartbreakingly radiant youths (one of them a dead ringer for Molly Ringwald) strike poses in a gold and russet pasture-- the same kind of beautiful misfits that Hughes arranged in after-school detention. In lyrics filled with lusty eruptions (\\"They are Gods! They are lightning!\\"), archetypal teens invent themselves with innocent fervor: A love-struck young couple in \\"Kim & Jessie\\"; a goth with a crown of black roses and a heart of bubblegum in \\"Graveyard Girl\\".<br /><br />Does \\"Couleurs\\" remind anyone else of an Orbital track?<br /><br />Check out the wonderful low-budget videos for \\"Kim and Jessie\\" and \\"Graveyard Girl\\" at Youtube.ng!\\"), archetypal teens invent themselves with innocent fervor: A love-struck young couple in \\"Kim & Jessie\\"; a goth with a crown of black roses and a heart of bubblegum in \\"Graveyard Girl\\".

0142501123|5.0|this is one of my son's favorite halloween stories.  the illustrations are colorful and fun, and the story is nice. In this story, as witch flies by on her broom, she drops something (her wand, the bow from her hair, etc).  She lands on the ground to search for the lost item, and meets a new friend who finds the item for her and asks for a ride on the broom. The broom gets pretty crowded, with a cat, a dog, a bird, a frog, and snaps in half.  When the broom crashes to the ground, the witch finds herself in trouble and her new friends come to her rescue.     There is one semi-scary dragon in the story, but it didn't seem to bother my 4yo. We love this story and I would absolutely recommend for preschool aged kids.
0765350386|5.0|The Final Empire is a great fantasy book! I've been a faithful Amazon consumer for many years and have never reviewed a book until now, even though I spend lots of time reading other people's reviews... I know, bad me, but this book is so fresh and exciting I figured I'd take the leap (burning pewter of course).    I am currently re-reading in preparation for the last book of the trilogy to come out next month and I have to say I'm just as impressed as I was the first time.  The characters are complex but not so much that you can't figure them out.  The story is engaging and suspenseful and the end is not typical at all.      Vin is excellently portrayed and I'm happy the story is about her, but I have to say that for my money I think the character of Kelsier is fantastic.  His not so subtle manipulations of everyone around him (for the common good) and his brutal decisions on what's best for the people and how to bring them about is very compelling, especially at the end of the book.    I also read and loved Well of Ascension and can't wait for the third.  If any of these reviews sway you at all and you're a sci-fi/fantasy fan you NEED to read this book!
0316067601|5.0|First let me say that I'm not a 'seasoned reader' as many who reviewed this book seem to be. I usually don't read for pleasure; just out of necessity. However, as many other reviewers have stated, this book was extremely hard to put down. I didn't read this book in order to 'critic the author or his writing skills'. Thankful American citizen who read this book to get a better realization of how blessed I am by those who give their all for the rest of us.  I laughed out loud many times and cried as well. I enjoyed the \\"Texas slang\\" that maybe only a Texan can truly understand. Marcus made me feel proud to be a Texan and an American. I was humbled by reading this book...to think of what our men and women put on the line for the rest of us, who soak up the air conditioner, while drinking our bottle water and eating junk food. The training of the SEALs was insane...I kept asking, \\"why would ANYONE do this out of their own free will?\\" I don't know very many people who could go through the training of the first week, much less the horrible experience that Marcus and his 3 buddies endured. So while many readers will state that this book makes unnecessary statements about our liberal media, etc....I feel this book was an explanation of how MARCUS saw things unfold. It's his book and he told the story HIS way. We could all watch the same scene and see something different, each of us with our own story of how things unfolded...but I feel he is entitled to his opinions, it's HIS book. Many reviewers state that Marcus was filled with hate and thinks we should kill anyone who gets in our way....well, that's NOT what he did in the book!! He allowed the three men to go on their way. He was very kind to those children and to the people who where NOT out to KILL him. He is a good Christian man from what I can tell. A man who almost gave his life for his country as many of his buddies did. And one reason he didn't die is because of his hardcore SEAL training and the NEVER DIE, bad-a$$ attitude they seem to instill..which I think WOULD be an necessary attitude in order to survive such events like the ones Marcus endured. Most of us would have just given up because we are not mentally strong enough to take the hell that he went through.  It is obvious to me that God has a big plan for this man's life. I applaud and give my utmost respect to all those who stand in harms way to protect me, my family, my freedom and this wonderful country we are so blessed to live in. God bless America (even though we don't deserve it) and God bless Texas!    The only thing about this book that I didn't care for was the foul language. But I realized that it's just part of the environment they operate in...IT IS WAR, and it's not pretty. I can't say that I wouldn't let a few four-letter words slip if I was put in the same situation. Right?
B000V86OKG|5.0|Absolutely love this series. Although the gore from the 1st series has been somewhat toned down, the story is just as good. Unlike many American TV shows Dexter does not just ask more questions that it provides answers for.  There is much more intimacy and its still full of twists and dark humour.  I cant wait for the next series... :)
B000PTYP5C|5.0|Dream Theater continues to be at the forefront of progressive metal.  \\"Chaos\\" manages to take elements from classic progressive rock and imbibe them with modern updated production.  Unlike some of their peers releases \\"Chaos\\" does not sound at all dated or stale.  \\"Chaos\\" is along the same lines as \\"Train Of Thought\\" or \\"Awake\\" in that much of the album is heavy and aggressive.  At times the band almost sounds like Pantera or Metallica in spots.  The album is a nice mix of mid length tunes and long epics.  The disc begins and ends with \\"In The Presence Of Enemies\\" which in total clocks in at right around 25 minutes.  \\"Ministry Of Lost Souls\\" is another long one at 15 minutes.  Both are really good.  Other highlights include the single \\"Forsaken\\" which is a cool little well written song.  \\"The Dark Eternal Night\\" and James Labrie's \\"Prophets Of War\\".  Dream Theater continues to expand their audience as \\"Chaos\\" was the band's highest charting album ever.  Older fans may not care for some of the nu-metal style of some of the tracks, but the band are technically as excellent as ever and get the chance to show off their chops throughout the disc.  All in all this is another fine album from Dream Theater.
B000YABIQ6|5.0|OK, the CD is just a recording of the show's first season.  If you love the show, you'll like the CD.  There is additional stuff like the actors' voice over perspective of episodes.  But mostly it's the writing!
B0001WTVUW|5.0|Quite simply, only a handful of movies have given me more chills down the spine than this one. The Day After accurately and intimately depicts the tragedy of a nuclear holocaust. Viewers end up thinking that the lucky ones are those that were killed immediately by the blast and, in no case, the actual survivors...<br /><br />The story is quite simple: a group of US citizens go through their daily occupations in a Mid-West city while, at the same time, political and military escalation between Russia and the US builds up. What must happen finally happens and, guess what, the nukes fly off and cross each other in the sky on their way to their respective targets.<br /><br />The movie goes on in its depiction of the war after the nukes actually detonate. The fate of the survivors is therefore shown in graphic, vivid and utterly realistic details. Each and every viewer is therefore capable of identifying him/herself to any of the featured characters, making for a closer personal proximity to the movie action and unfolding drama.<br /><br />The main originality and interest of this movie is that, first, unlike its predecessors and successors, this end-of-the-world tale goes beyond the actual act of the ICBM's lifting off their launch pads. It's like the movie finally dares lifting some veil off the real mystery and horror of the survivors' conditions and struggle to remain alive. The survivors are just human beings that constantly have to fight their radioactive \\"illness\\". We all know how futile and useless such a struggle is...<br /><br />Second, this movie was of almost historical reach when it was first released in 1983. Its shock-wave in the media and public opinion was so powerful that it made the headlines of newspapers back then. People talked about it with fear in their heart and mind. It certainly played a great role in making people accutely aware of the end results of a nuclear conflict, whereas most of them had never questioned its necessity until then. I have no doubt that this movie led to a greater level of awareness on this subject in the West and ultimately helped in negotiating the non-proliferation of nuclear WMD's treaties between the US and Russia throughout the 80's and early 90's.<br /><br />A must-see movie about what nukes can do and the conditions they would leave us in as a species -should they ever take to the skies...a greater level of awareness on this subject in the West and ultimately helped in negotiating the non-proliferation of nuclear WMD's treaties between the US and Russia throughout the 80's and early 90's.

B000T9OP7G|5.0|I missed this show when it first aired, and then saw episode 3 and 4 as reruns. I really enjoyed the characters and the action but realized I didn't understand a lot of the plot. I stopped watching the reruns and ordered this DVD. After watching the first season in the order they were shot I have a much better understanding of the plot and enjoy watching the show with my family much more than if I had skipped some of the first episodes.    If you like this show you should watch all the episodes.
B00192KCQ0|5.0|Let me first start off saying that this is by far the BEST album released in since \\"Black\\". I know that half of the people who read this will disagree with me but that's okay, last time I've checked this is a free country. I first was introduced to MetallicA via the Masters album which was during the release of the Justice album. I was instantly hooked, I started to buy all things MetallicA. I liked the Black album so much that I saw them live two times that year and including the Summer Sanitarium tour in 2003 and the St. Anger tour later that year I've seen MetallicA live 12 times and they are far better live than on any album.     That being said I've always kept an open mind when I've gotten word of a new album. They all can't be like Kill, Ride, Master, and Justice. MetallicA as a group HAS to evolve, that includes what some might consider \\"failure\\" but, without failure you can't succeed. I'm probably a rarity of MetallicA fan since I like all of there albums. Each one has good and bad points. And who really cares if this doesn't get any air play? I don't, I live in BFE and only get one Country station and one Christian Rock station at my house. As an older fan, my music tastes have changed a lot since I was in high school in the late 80's. I've now been listening to Country music for the last 3 years but I STILL break out the MetallicA, Iron Maiden, Suicidal Tendencies, Megadeath, AC/DC, Pantera, Anthrax, Rush,etc. just as much as I listen to Gary Allen, Brad Paisley (The best guitar non-rock solos), Van Zant, and Allen Jackson.  Plus I listen to one of the BEST bands out there and as far as I know it only had one song that got very limited air play and that is Dream Theater. All they have proved is that you don't need air play and short 5 minute songs to have a huge fan base. So, basically I would recommend this album for anybody who likes metal based music. It totally blows away anything else released by any of the so called new \\"metal/hard rock\\" bands in the last 10 years.     I didn't even know that MetallicA had a new album out until I heard something that sounded like MetallicA playing on a radio in a Best Buy and went to look for it in the shelf. My only complaint is the liner notes having the ridiculous cut outs, but if you cant figure out the lyrics after listening to the album a few times, too bad for you. It's not that difficult. Will I buy their next album? Ear unheard it will be a definite YES. I have over 30 MetallicA CD's in my collection, so why would I want to stop now?  Besides I was known as MetallicA MikE in college for a reason.
0142004235|3.0|East of Eden is probably Steinbeck\\"s best work. I read it when I was 14 or 15 yeaars old and am now reading it again at age 50. My public library had an old yellowed copy which I could not read. Great book, read or read it again. I was dissappointed with the typeface, way too small but the work holds up.
6305971153|5.0|I love this movie, Dudley Moore and John Lithgow are fabulous and so is the rest of the cast! I got it for a reasonable price, especially since no one anywhere had it. Thank you.
B0017R5UAA|5.0|This is My favorite Fleet Foxes-White Winter Hymnal is my pick this year for music.The Video is what drew me to purchase the CD.
B0015KO52S|5.0|Keeping it simple:    This is literally one of my favorite albums I have ever owned.    It's amazing.
B0012E6R3W|3.0|well, I am probably going to catch hell for saying this, but I was somewhat underwhelmed by this release.  but I have to call it as I see it- I am not one of those fans who will automatically give 5 stars \\"just because.\\"  while the band is in top form, and the production is good, in my opinion, there aren't any memorable songs here.  it's full-on heavy, but that's it.  there's no \\"feel\\" to it. it's just heavy for the sake of being heavy. there's a lot of heavy stuff that has \\"feel\\" to it (go back and listen to older testament and you will understand what I mean), but in this case, i'm just not getting the vibe.  with skolnick and petersen reuniting, I was hoping for the great riffs you'd expect whenever those two team up.  but the riffs that just stick in your head (think \\"into the pit\\" or \\"burnt offerings\\") weren't there.  ditto the leads.  skolnick shreds, but again, there is just nothing memorable.  there is some great, albeit generic, drumming from bostaph, as you'd expect (louie who?). just your standard rapid-fire thrash drumming.  I do believe their best stuff is definitely behind them.  it's great that testament is back and maintaining a presence on the scene, but their older stuff is definitely what carries them.  if you are a hardcore fan, you will buy this regardless, but if you are new to testament, I would recommend their earlier stuff.  this is one of those discs that you listen to and when it's over, you say to yourself, \\"so this is it?\\"  not horrible, but not great by any stretch of the imagination.  this is an old-school bay-area thrash band just going through the motions.
B001E780W8|2.0|On their new CD \\"All Hope is Gone\\" Slipknot find themselves continuing their trend of mixing decent Slipknot songs with horrible Stone Sour tracks and mixing pointless ambient/whining filler tracks in between to make it look like they actually wrote enough songs for a full album.  Honestly... 4 years between releases and you still feel the need to fluff it up with filler junk just to irritate people that will have to push the skip button?<br /><br />I can't say the effort is completely devoid of high points but they are few and far between.  To get it out of the way, I recommend downloading the songs \\"Vendetta\\" and \\"Butcher's Hook\\".  If you like those you might also consider the title track \\"All Hope is Gone\\".  Anything else on here would send any self respecting Slipknot fan down a dark spiral of depression and disappointment.<br /><br />I can't think of many things that make me cringe quite as hard as Corey Taylor's style of redneck-emo that he brings to most Stone Sour songs and, sadly, the majority of what's on display here on AHIG.  I realize it's probably hard to maintain a grip on your sense of anger and hostility when you've had the kind of success that Corey has, but he certainly hasn't lost the ability to feel sorry for himself and whine monotonously for 4 or 5 minutes at a time.<br /><br />There are some guitar solos on the album here, and I do at least respect the effort.  I can't say the results are particularly impressive as they're some of the most lackluster and uninspired solos I've ever heard recorded, but at least the thought was there.  I can't imagine what gave them the idea to put them on here, maybe they were just out to prove that Joey isn't actually the only talented person in the band.  Unfortunately they didn't do much but reinforce that fact.<br /><br />Recommended for fans of Nickelback, Saliva, new Staind.

B001CD6FKS|5.0|The Legend is back, in another spectacular triumph for the Wachowski brothers. They were the exact right choice to write and direct this resurrection of essentially a simplistic early-anime kiddie cartoon from my childhood. Within the context of what they had to work with, the results were better than one might expect; they pulled off a completely original re-telling of the franchise story line, while staying at the same time completely faithful to the original family-values sensibilities of it.<br /><br />There was stellar casting, lots of action, humor and drama, a compelling story line with an interesting subplot, an unprecedented CGI environment for the racing action, and even hints of a post-apocalyptic future, while staying non-violent, and kid-friendly throughout. Adults have to put up with a little too much Spridle and ChimChim, kids have to try and sort out complex flashback time distortions, so the minor annoyances balanced each other out, and were worth it in their appeal to both types of audiences.<br /><br />The whole \\"art-direction\\" vibe was very early seventies, neatly contrasted with a technologically-sophisticated near future. The Blu-ray disc that I viewed was as good, maybe better visually, than anything I have watched on my PS3, and the surround sound encoding on it was nothing short of spectacular, from the racing car sounds to the brilliantly updated theme song/soundtrack. Even the final credit thing/closing song were somewhat entertaining, for once, with the chimp jamming recklessly on a go-cart to a fun type of hip-hop song.<br /><br />They pretty much covered the whole 36-episode storyline, so there will either be no sequel, or they will have to write some brand new material for the franchise. I think that puts them in a similar position to the one they were in after they made the first Matrix film, as they have a very hard act to follow, but the Wachowskis were obviously inspired when they wrote this screenplay, so there's hope for more high-quality, family-friendly drama, action, and comedy from this long-standing franchise.<br /><br />I will admit that if the the connection to my childhood wasn't involved, I would be rating this movie four stars. But if you're a fan of the original from past years gone by, the rating stands!
B00008EYA5|4.0|I don't expect action movie to be something more then a pure entertainment. I can swallow lack of logic and I can deal with stupid characters without any personality. But there are some things action movie needs like air  that is action. Explosions, escapes, fighting scenes, some tension, few surprises and good soundtrack. It's not much, isn't it? So why oh why was I denied these simple pleasures here? \\"S.W.A.T.\\" is so boring. There are few action sequences but very unimaginative. Everything is obvious and plain that you just want this stupid movie to end as quickly as possible. I like Farrell, Jackson and Rodriguez but in \\"S.W.A.T.\\" any piece of wood could do their job. There's no acting, there's no story there is only too loud, badly chosen music. Shame, shame, shame
B00192KCQ0|3.0|*This review was written while I listened to it on headphones for the first time*<br /><br />That Was Just Your Life. @4:43 Kirk's 1st shreddin solo, by then I'd determined this really was a bit of a comeback. Yes, right at the beginning it fools around for a minute and a half, then gears up for ten seconds before giving it a real go. And although by now there's a legion of bands out there doing this sort of thing better, at long last and at very least, Metallica Got The Message.<br /><br />Track 2 The End Of The Line continues this if somewhat fashionably familiar trend. Now I just wanna ask them. wtf were you thinking? Before. Now this. This is what you were supposed to be doing all along. About time. @4:20 of The End Of The Line the snazzy guitar work raises my eyebrows a bit. The chuggy riffs @4:50 are sick and Kirk's solo here is wicked. Great. @5:18 the song picks up again; Not too shabby, guys. And @5:45 you surprise me that you're not done yet. There's a sweet, soft descension with James's lamenting refrain \\"the Slave becomes the Master\\" - and then it rocks out hard to reach the end of the line after the 7:30 mark. Like I said before, nothing a dozen metal bands today couldn't do, but it's certainly awesome to hear Metallica do it. And I'd wager few if any could belt it out with their signature stamp on it.<br /><br />Broken, Beat, & Scarred, Track 3. By :42 seconds we're groovin'. @1:02 I'm buzzed up by the riff, James starts singing about Rising Again Through Black Days And Nights. Broken, bleeding, scarred, We Die Hard -- yeah, alright. I don't know, this one kinda goes down a notch lyrically for me, but the rockin' riffage hardens my wang tango, and @fter the 4 min mark there's some more moments where someone woke up Kirk Hammett and signalled him to play lead guitar -- these moments (and they pop up all over the freakin place) are some of this album's finest dark little jewels. Thanks, Kirk. Although sometimes I just want James to shut up, ya know? Oh and I forgot to mention (as that 4th song starts up) - I was impressed with Lars' drumming halfway through the first track.<br /><br />I like the melody of that 4th track - The Day That Never Comes - It's one of those \\"Hit The Right Buttons\\" metal songs. If you can honestly jam out to this \\"But The Sunshine Never Comes NO\\" then you, my friend, are a true dyed-in-the-wool rocker. I like how most of the songs shift into a new gear after the four or five minute mark, tho' the attempt at thrashin up the end of this song doesn't quite work for it, imo.  Some really terrible lyrics here, too. What's up with \\"This I Swear\\", it's kinda . . . awkward. But then notice how Kirk comes to the rescue to steal away our attention from it with some total hammerblastin', finger pickin', striped-pants kneelin' jimmy jammin'. And then he wails out with a guitar-neck-lickin', triplicate-hammered solo wackjob, its almost classical. The song comes to a crashing close @ just under 8 min. Right on.<br /><br />05. All Nightmare Long. Nice Egyptian sounding (or is it Mideastern?) intro lead guitar work . . . then . . . a nice tempo elevation . . . a rhythm fattening . . . injecting chunkiness...put on repeat, and the head begins some bangin' Alright, then... oops... head stops bangin' . . . James is babbling . . . wtf man . . . @ 2 min, headbangin' recommences... @2:26 it continues in earnest . . . w/James all \\"Hunt you down All Nightmare Long\\" Yeah the headbangin' is keepin' steady... pretty much. Actually, @3:20 there's a respite from it, again. James sings of burning Opeth albums, then issues out an idle threat while @ 4:00 the headbangin' recommences once again. Oops -- luck runs out @4:30 ... the bangin' loses footing temporarily; but Kirk gets back up and relaunches his attack with renewed force (I think it's kind of ironic that despite Trujillo being partly responsible for this re-enervation, he still can't always be heard in the mix.) I think part of this must be because he's so in step with the other guys...I don't know. Well he's clearly heard at the intro to--<br /><br />Track 6, Cyanide. There's another hard riff that demands a turning up of the volume. Headbanging commences @ 1:10. By this point in the album, it's obvious Metallica finally listened to their therapists, I mean their fans. Our extended beseechment that they just play metal for cryin' out loud has finally, after all these years, been answered.  The songs on Death Magnetic are the results. It has its problems. Like 3 minutes into this song, for instance. It slows down into kind of a lame refrain. But after a few more chuggy riffs, slammed frets, and yet another paroxysm from Kirk (who I think may have gotten his pant leg caught in his fretboard at this point) to try and wrest our wandering attentions away from James Hetfield's hysterics. \\"It's just the funeral I've been waiting for...\\" Uh-huh...<br /><br />07: So this must be the Unforgiven III... piano, puke-worthy strings, an air of affected mournfulness. . . Fat slobbery tuba. Ew, gross. Almost one minute . . . OK, finally some bass and guitar. A rapidly crescendoing cymbal intro from Lars. More predictable, mournful strings of sap. Then James, right foot firmly on the prow of his ship, begins navigating them through the oncoming storm of repeated old Tallica cliches to the point you have to say \\"I don't know James, how can you blame us?\\" But at the 3:20 mark I'll be dadgummed if I don't start jamming a bit to it. Alright so this is an okay generic blockbuster of a ... sequel to a . . . sequel. I guess the title really does say it all. And no, no, we won't forgive you for this. What's with the \\"Forgive me, Forgive me not\\", are ya picking apart flowers trying to decide? Ok I'm just having fun with it cuz the song's so dang long, I got pulled off course. This is the song that should not be.<br /><br />08. Starts strong. The Judas Kiss. By :32 seconds, I'm still interested. Thinking about banging my head. Then @ the 1 min mark, right before the vocals, I would've began rocking, I mean, I almost did but James slowed it down for a sec, and even though the song-- whoa, hold on a sec -- here's some cool riffage -- I catch snatches of lyrics floating up at me \\"When You Think Its All Said And Done\\" and finally I submit to the infectious groove provided in part by Rob, but brought home by the Ol' 3, who seem to be thrashing together as a band for the first time since And Justice For All. I mean, they are leaning into these songs. \\"Judas Lives, Recite This Vow, I've Become Your New God Now\\" I don't know what this really means but it sounds pretty wicked in a metal song huh. See, that's part of the problem -- a lot of cheezy lyrics -- but who puts fine grammatical compositions so high up on their metal priority list, after all? Okay, I understand he's referencing something about betrayal, I'm just saying, for Metallica 2008, this is way cool, but for metal in general, well . . . why don't I just say they're like the Generals of Generic Metal now, or something. I'm trying to mean that in a good way.<br /><br />Track 9 (Suicide & Redemption) is struggling along after the two minute mark, I'm not sure it has realized itself into a proper song, as of yet. But see, that's the cool thing about this album-- It's like an extended jam session experimenting on itself. This song gets better after 3 minutes. Aha, this is the instrumental. I see. There's Kirk's post-shattered-American-Dream solo, extending past the four minute mark. Yeah this song kinda redeems itself for me during its galloping middle and outro- part. There's Rob's bassline, rumblin' along again. I see how it is now. So James and Kirk are really effectively covering up a lot of Rob's bass lines, but can you blame them really? Why doesn't Rob just turn his bass up to 11? At least Lars is trying really hard on this song. I hope he didn't get a hernia during these sessions. Oh my god - they actually think they're RUSH on this song, or something.Um, see... this is where, just for one comparison, why . . . ah never mind.<br /><br />10: My Apocalypse snaps me awake, pronto. Cool . . . it gets semi-thrashin' at around the thirty second mark. James sounds a bit re-invigorated, if a little on the curds and whey side. But that guitar lead intro before the 2 min mark is wicked! \\"Spit It Out\\" barks James while they Jam On It. Is this a sly lil' RickRubin/SlipKnot reference? Haha. wtf. Is this the last song I begin to wonder... he's singin' \\"See The End In Me\\" just in time... yeah this might be it folks. I can hear all four of them pretty clearly now. \\"Suffer Forever My Apocalypse-AH\\", a heavy guitar crunch flourish,<br />The End.<br /><br />Wow. Sure enough -- 10 tracks. Now that's a relief. We've been given what we asked for. Metallica has released Death Magnetic and they weren't even that pretentious about it.<br />Rock on, guys.<br /><br />This is Luciferal and I kinda like the new Metallica. \m/almost did but James slowed it down for a sec, and even though the song-- whoa, hold on a sec -- here's some cool riffage -- I catch snatches of lyrics floating up at me \\"When You Think Its All Said And Done\\" and finally I submit to the infectious groove provided in part by Rob, but brought home by the Ol' 3, who seem to be thrashing together as a band for the first time since And Justice For All.

B00005V1Y0|3.0|I recently watched the first film in the noted Red Curtain Trilogy by Australian filmmaker Baz Luhrmann, Strictly Ballroom. This 1993 indie classic preceded its more well known and more highly budgeted siblings, Romeo + Juliet, and Moulin Rouge. While I enjoyed the twists to modernize Shakespeare in the former and the non-stop rollercoaster of the latter- and I am notoriously averse to musicals, I believe that Strictly Ballroom is probably the best of the three films, followed by Moulin Rouge and Romeo + Juliet. They are all good films, mind you, and Luhrmann is one of the most innovative filmmakers around, but there is an emotional punch that this film packs that the two later films lack- as they are more style over substance, albeit wonderful style. This is not to argue that Strictly Ballroom is flawless- it's not, but it is a prime example of a film making use of a `classic' formula, yet avoiding clich&eacute; by virtue of its innovation and excellence of execution in all areas.... Yet, the film is also a wonderfully filmed piece. There are two scenes that are just gorgeously composed. Early in the film Scott and Fran are practicing on the roof of the Les Kendall (Peter Whitford) dance studio, where his parents teach, under a Coca-Cola sign, as the sun sets. Alone, the composition is wonderful, but as a version of the Cyndi Lauper hit song Time After Time plays on it is a memorable shot. Then, there is the scene, set near Fran's parents' home at a railyard, that could have been right out of Dr. Zhivago- with a rich dark blue sky, a chain link fence, and just the two characters on a barren landscape. Just beautiful. It's no wonder Luhrmann's films are all visual marvels.<br />  In a sense this light-hearted comedy reminded me most of the later My Big, Fat Greek Wedding in how it approached odd situations and characters and humanized them by having them funneled through experiences that moviegoers have seen too many times before with people like themselves, and it's this very dissonance of the unexpected and the expected, as well as great acting and filmmaking, that allow films like those two to succeed, where lesser films and filmmakers fail.y dissonance of the unexpected and the expected, as well as great acting and filmmaking, that allow films like those two to succeed, where lesser films and filmmakers fail.
B0011UBDTK|1.0|I love the series, it's worth buying.  But this series from Amazon is defective.  I returned my first one due to the freezing up on discs, particulary Season 3.  I received my second one and it has the exact same problem!
B00080ZG10|3.0|The problem that almost all biopics have is that they tell far too much of their subjects' life facts that most of the drama is drained. They never seem to find the important nor key moments in a life in which to imbue the tale, rather they cram a life with minutia, and miss out on any real insight. Such it is with Martin Scorsese's latest film, now out on DVD. The Aviator spans twenty or so years in the life of Howard Hughes, the reclusive billionaire and eccentric, but never delves into the man, merely glossing the surface of its subject, mainly due to the pallid script by John Logan of Gladiator infamy. Having recently watched a DVD version of Raging Bull, from 1980, the difference is stark. I've never thought Raging Bull was Scorsese's best work- it's not on a par with Taxi Driver, The King Of Comedy, After Hours, nor Goodfellas- but it can be argued as a great film, and it's a cut above this film whose first half has potential, albeit flawed, but whose second half reeks.<br />  The film has many flaws, other than the script, though. The major one being Leonardo DiCaprio is simply not a good nor compelling actor, especially in comparison to Robert De Niro. He is, next to Tom Cruise, perhaps the most milquetoast and passionless actor going and radiates none of the magnetism, power, and arrogance of the real man- he is a boy pretending to be a man, and clearly way out of his league. He has absolutely zero range, and is unwilling to let go of himself to the role. He is always Leonardio DiCaprio, never Howard Hughes. Better actors, like Brad Pitt in Kalifornia or A River Runs Through It, do so. DiCaprio is woefully miscast- although since he shepherded the film to fruition Scorsese had little choice but to use him. First off, he doesn't age, as Hughes, in the twenty years of the film- what? Was all the money gone for looser prosthetic jowls or crow's feet? At forty-five Hughes still looks like a teenager, especially in scenes with his airline rival Juan Trippe, as played by Alec Baldwin, a man who in real life was only a few years older than Hughes. Next to Baldwin the two characters seem of different generations- as the fey DiCaprio may not be able to pass for thirty until he's fifty or sixty, and certainly never lets us in to the `real' Hughes', as he is content with mere gesticulation. DiCaprio also looks nothing like Hughes, facially, but that's not so important if the acting is up to snuff- think Anthony Hopkins as Richard Nixon in Oliver Stone's Nixon. This evidences itself in that DiCaprio sounds nothing like Hughes, and the constant ticking and twitching he does to suggest that Hughes suffered from Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder is just too carny for a convincing dramatic role, even up to the film's final shot of Hughes in a Tourette's Syndrome-like daze- which is far too reminiscent of both the prison and end scenes of Raging Bull. It's never a good sign when a director has to rip off a better, earlier film of his own.... While not bad, that's also not good.

DiCaprio also looks nothing like Hughes, facially, but that's not so important if the acting is up to snuff- think Anthony Hopkins as Richard Nixon in Oliver Stone's Nixon. This evidences itself in that DiCaprio sounds nothing like Hughes, and the constant ticking and twitching he does to suggest that Hughes suffered from Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder is just too carny for a convincing dramatic role, even up to the film's final shot of Hughes in a Tourette's Syndrome-like daze- which is far too reminiscent of both the prison and end scenes of Raging Bull. It's never a good sign when a director has to rip off a better, earlier film of his own.... While not bad, that's also not good. If you need proof just ask yourself if you ever thought you'd hear a phrase like `a rather conventional Hollywood film by Martin Scorsese' and you'll get the points that Scorsese did not.

B0006IIPIK|4.0|Sky Captain And The World Of Tomorrow is perhaps the first film whose computer special effects wizardry was trotted out as a reason to see it that I can honestly say is a good film, a very good film. Are there films that bowl one over more impressively? Yes. But this film is virtually all special effects, and was filmed on a blue screen soundstage. The texture of the film, the lighting, and the iconographic imagery, as well as stylistic techniques, all evoke the feel of 1930s-1950s era science fiction films, especially the serial films of that period.<br />  First time director Kerry Conran does a marvelous job of recreating the feel of when the world was still large and dark and fearsome, in this late 2004 film, even more so than Peter Jackson did in last year's late sci fi entry King Kong. Where that film was a remake of a classic sci fi film from that era, this film is an homage, and it succeeds all the more for it. Perhaps the only thing that could have made it more rollicking was the use of chapter breaks, which the DVD commentaries say was tried, but ultimately cut out of the final cut of the film, which is only 95 minutes long, and moves briskly. The plot is threadbare, but that's perfect for this action oriented sci fi serial homage. The pre-World war Two world is being decimated by giant flying robots who steal all manner of industrial equipment. New York is laid waste, and reporter Polly Perkins (Gwyneth Paltrow) has a lead as to who may be behind it all.<br />Yet, as referential as it is, the film establishes its own identity, with repartee between Polly and Joe hinting at a romantic past that went kaput, and their banter about her only having two photograph shots left, add quite a bit to characterization, in an offhanded way. Paltrow evokes the sort of heroine a Faith Domergue played in many such films. There are also many small touches that enhance scenes and characters, such as when Polly and Joe land on the Totenkopf's island, she notices that the reflection of his plane's serial number h110d spells Polly, in the reflected water, or the excellent use of scenes from The Wizard Of Oz in Radio City Music Hall, as Polly questions a scared scientist. Almost every scene has such details that subliminally enhance the overall work. Compared to Steven Spielberg's lame Indiana Jones serial homage film series from twenty years ago, Sky Captain And The World Of Tomorrow shows how to do it right, using special effects as an integral part of the tale, not just for a wow factor. It will be interesting to see, if after a decade making this film, Conran is only a one hit wonder, or a true young stud of cinema. He's already shown he has a better visual style than Spielberg, and certainly a better understanding for character and plot, for he knows that such beautiful fluff plays best when played straight.of his plane's serial number h110d spells Polly, in the reflected water, or the excellent use of scenes from The Wizard Of Oz in Radio City Music Hall, as Polly questions a scared scientist.

B00004XPPK|5.0|Even if you do not watch any of the rest of this movie, the Rita Hayworth singing \\"Put the Blame on Mame, Boys\\" scene is worth five or more stars.  She is absolutely beautiful, perfect in sensuality.  Her gown is a dream.  Her flawless skin, white teeth, and cascading volumes of hair--what woman would not want to look like that? Gilda is a perfect name for her. I do remember Glen Ford being very dark and charismatic in the film also and the tension heightened by their love/hate relationship.<br />Gilda IS this noir movie.
B0006IIKS0|3.0|The documentary film Metallica: Some Kind Of Monster is an example of a not so good piece of art about a subject that is not so good. Don't get me wrong, I'm a Metallica fan, and not one of those morons who refuse to grow up and believe their early thrash songs that sound all alike are somehow artistically superior to their later songs with melody and lyrics with a little more depth. It's just that while the filmmakers and band members hoped to do a film of `great depth', which the commentary tracks harp on, the truth is that the members of the band are unwittingly close to the Spinal Tap territory inherent in any such venture. Basically, after bassist Jason Newsted left the band in 2001, over artistic differences, lead singer James Hetfield and drummer Lars Ulrich warred for control over the band's future, while lead guitarist Kirk Hammett pretty much sat on the sidelines. Eventually, the band hired a $40,000 a month counselor named Phil Towle, not even a real shrink, to tell them things that any twelve year old could figure out.<br />  Hetfield is an addictive sort, whose terminal machismo landed him in rehab, after doing a Ted Nugent impression, by going to kill bears in Siberia, then bleating over missing his son's first birthday, Ulrich is an artistic poseur, truly befuddled at the supposed `meaning' of gold trim in terrible Basquiat paintings, which he later sells off for several million dollars, and asking such probing queries as `Where does art begin? Where does it end?', and Hammett simply doesn't know how to cope with either, in between vacuously staring in camera and declaring himself egoless,. Add in do-nothing producer Bob Rock, for what would eventually become their St. Anger CD, and the makings for a great comic film are there, in spades....
B00009RDGA|5.0|No matter what we think of the personal lives of Ryan and Tatum now, (none of our business, anyway) there can be no denying that this Father/Daughter team could act--and what-on screen chemistry they project. Their expressions and timing are amazing as we imagine them using their real lives as valuable experience for the roles.  The whole motley crew is entertaining.  Con man, standoffish and manipulative young female offspring, exotic dancer, Trixie Delight, played so well by Madelyn Kahn, the bickering of young Addie and Trixie over \\"possession\\" of Moses Pray, the rich textures of the rural Thirties landscape.  It is a beautiful, beautiful and humorous movie.  I wish the father and daughter could have given us more of this wonderful stuff over the years.

B0000026HB|5.0|This is the 100 m sprint version of Verdi's Falstaff, leaving even Toscanini's classic 1950 recording with Valdengo in the dust !  Unlike some reviewers, I think the singers are first rate.  Fischer-Dieskau, not an obvious choice for the lead role, brings energy, wit and wisdom, to the character of the fat knight, not to mention his clear diction.  He was a perfectionist, and always faithful to the music, the text and the role.  His intelligence and humanity allowed him to sing Verdi roles more convincingly than some of his Italian counterparts.  An example that comes to mind is Rodrigo in Solti's Don Carlo, recorded in 1966, the same year as this set.  He was criticized then too, for being too 'cerebral', too 'Germanic'.  The fact is that Fischer-Dieskau offers a more complex, multi-dimensional, approach, interpreting the characters to make them believable on a human scale.  (No mean feat in the world of opera !)  Resnik, with her fruity voice, is especially notable, and funny, as Mistress Quickly.  And Panerai, his second recorded Ford (the first with Karajan in 1956, ten years earlier), portrays the 'cuckhold' husband with just the right amount of bluster.  The rest of the cast is equally commendable.  This opera requires singers who can also act, and there is no weak link in this recording.  The Wiener Philharmoniker, with their lush sound, perform superbly.<br /><br />I have seven other recordings of Falstaff, including the 'classics' conducted by Toscanini, Karajan (Gobbi), and Solti (Evans); and a few newer versions by Giulini (Bruson), and Davis (Pertusi).  Even, Daniel's version in English (Shore).  Each adds something different to Verdi's masterpiece.  Needles to say, Verdi's Falstaff is at the top of my list of operatic works !<br /><br />Pick the Bernstein recording if you are looking for the 'madcap' approach, with orchestra and singers harnessed expertly by a master conductor.  Bernstein communicates the sheer fun intended in Verdi's last opera.  At the conclusion, you may be left exhausted, but smiling.you may be left exhausted, but smiling.

I've heard that George Lucas did not want to produce a DVD of the original theatric version of Star Wars, but felt compelled by fan demand.  Even though the 1977 version is a mediocre-quality dub of the original film (& not anamorphic), it is wonderful to see it much the same way as I did when it was in the theater.  Get it while it's still at a decent price, & still available!
B0007Y08QA|3.0|The Machinist is the sort of film Hollywood does not dare to make- risky, taut, and smart. While not a great film it certainly is loads better than the usual bilge Hollywood feeds the public. That director Brad Anderson (who directed Session 9) had to go to Barcelona, Spain to finance and film the picture says it all. The film stars Christian Bale (who lost over 60 lbs. for the role) as Trevor Reznik, a machinist who has not slept in a year and is wasting away physically. His only sources of comfort seem to be a prostitute named  Stevie (Jennifer Jason Leigh) that he sleeps with, and an airport caf&eacute; waitress named Maria (Aitana Sanchez-Gijon), whom he confesses to. Then, one day, on a break at work, Trevor meets Ivan (John Sharian)- a bald biker dude with a Cajun accent, red sportscar, and a claw for a hand- after his left hand was mangled in an accident. Not long after Trevor accidentally causes the dismemberment of a co-worker named Miller (Michael Ironside) and is shunned at work. He seems to be losing his mind when no one believes him that the reason the accident occurred was because he was looking at Ivan- whom his bosses claim is not on the payroll....  Perhaps the only downsides to the film are Leigh's hooker with a heart of gold (although she does what little she can with the role) and the ending. As Trevor sleeps he dreams of the first few moments after the accident and then we get a fade out. There should have been something more definitive and climactic than merely Trevor's getting shuteye. The end feels almost tacked on, as if Kosar had no idea how to get out of the corner he painted his character into. Still, were this a Hollywood film there would have been car explosions, pedophilia, and many other overblown elements. The best thing for this screenplay was that it had to be made overseas. There are a number of excellent little points in the film, such as scattered Dostoevsky and Kafka references, Trevor's looking eerily like his Nine Inch Nails namesake Trent Reznor, Trevor's choosing to turn left, in the Route 666 kid's ride with Nicholas, and in the sewers, when he encounters forks in a road, until the end, where he turns himself in and turns right on the highway, which picks up on the mangled left hands of Miller and Ivan and other left aligned things in the film. Also, Michael Ironside- who works far too little- seems to always lose a limb in his films.ake Trent Reznor, Trevor's choosing to turn left, in the Route 666 kid's ride with Nicholas, and in the sewers, when he encounters forks in a road, until the end, where he turns himself in and turns right on the highway, which picks up on the mangled left hands of Miller and Ivan and other left aligned things in the film.

031606792X|5.0|I have to say that as I read the book, I was in total shock by the story line - I didn't expect anything other than Bella and Edward getting married and finally getting to consummate their love.  After that, I knew I was in for a wild ride.  Boy, was I ever.  By the time I finished the book, sobbing in happiness, I knew it was such a grand ending to my favorite series.  Since then having reread it, and the shock having worn off, the book turns out to be even better!  I cannot understand the division among the fandom for this book.  I honestly cannot see the supposed \\"plot holes\\" that the haters refer to, nor do I care for the Publishers Weekly review that is posted here; I think it's an unjust review.  It was a wonderfully crafted story, and who cares if it's a happily ever after ending?  I deal with enough negativity in the real world on a daily basis, and reading for me is an escape, so I'm thrilled that *someone* gets everything they wanted and more in the end!  Bella and Edward struggled for so long throughout the first three books, how does it make sense to deny them every good thing?  Some think that Renesmee was a \\"deus ex machina\\" but she was not created with that in mind - in fact, she managed to cause problems form the Cullens, and I think potentially down the road, if Stephenie decides to come back to Forks, WA some day to pick up the story from another point of view in the future (i.e. Renesmee or Leah).  I really didn't find Jacob imprinting on Nessie as creepy, as the idea was introduced earlier with Quil and Claire, and that wasn't creepy.  Some don't like how all loose ends were tied up with Jacob still in Bella's life but as her future son-in-law...but really, c'mon, its A BOOK.  Bella always knew that Jacob was destined to be in her life somehow, just not as a love interest.  I really like that she and Edward actually got to have a family of their own which they weren't expecting and Bella was more than prepared to never have.  So what if she didn't go to college? She has forever to do that! And who cares that she got married at 18 and within months has a child?  Who cares that she wanted to delay transforming to a vampire for a year to enjoy married life with Edward while staying human (read as: enjoy having sex before she becomes a rabid newborn who won't be thinking of the greatest love of her life)? I'd do the same! Obviously, those circumstances changed when she became pregnant and in order to save her life she had to be turned.  True, you identify with Bella less as a vampire, because she isn't entirely the same anymore, but she is still \\"her\\" and it was absolutely engrossing to read part 3 of the book where you get all her vampirey goodness!  As to the ending with the Volturi, I think the physical battle people wanted is extremely overrated.  I much enjoyed the mental, defensive battle that concluded the story, and I was so delighted that Bella really got to save the day with her new vamp power.      The best part of the book? The last few pages *SPOILER* where Bella finally gets to maneuver her mental shield to let Edward in her head, to see her murky human memories of when they were first together and show him just how much she has always loved him.      The worst part of the book? The last page that said \\"The End.\\"    Enjoy this book and don't make the mistake of the 1-star reviewers and read too much into this story.  You're doing yourself a disservice by making more out of it than is required.  It's a lovely story that keeps you on the edge of your seat and will have you crying with joy at the end.      Thank you, Stephenie Meyer, for an epic ending to a fantastic series!
B0002KQNJU|3.0|One of the overlooked things about most of the vintage 1960s and 1970s Hammer Studios horror films is that they were quite funny, often in an unintentional way. Yes, Christopher Lee had a certain charm, but is it not true that he was also far more grandly silly than scary? Looking back on those films, they certainly do not hold up as well as even the Universal Bela Lugosi takes on the genre, much less superior vampire films like the silent F.W. Murnau classic Nosferatu, Carl Dreyer's Vampyr, nor Werner Herzog's Nosferatu, Phantom Of The Night. No, the Hammer films were always more along the line of the non-George Romero zombie flicks- full of hammy acting, bad gags, cheap effects, few scares, but a ton of laughs- not unlike the same era's Godzilla films.<br />  Thus, Roman Polanski's 1967 color parody film The Fearless Vampire Killers, or: Pardon Me, But Your Teeth Are In My Neck, his followup to the highly successful psychological masterpiece Repulsion, had a tough row to hoe, because it's trying to satirize a genre that, by its nature, was borderline parody to begin with. The good thing is, that while The Fearless Vampire Killers is not a great film, by any stretch of the word, it is highly entertaining, and a good diversion from ones cares- right up there with some of the best Abbott & Costello Meet films. But, it is a bit more sophisticated, and the influence of the 1960s can be see in its choice of ironic title- far better than Polanski's dull and misleading European original, Dance Of The Vampires, and is right in league with other big budget comedies of that time, such as It's A Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World, Dr. Strangelove, Or How I Learned To Stop Worrying And Love The Bomb (alternate titles were in vogue), Casino Royale, and What's New, Pussycat? If only Polanski had cast Peter Sellers in this film it may have become a true classic, rather than a merely amusing curio.<br />  Yet, when The Fearless Vampire Killers works, and if one considers it successful, it is as a comedy. There is not a dram of real horror in the film, save for the creepy soundtrack by Polanski collaborator Krzysztof Komeda, and in this regard it's about as scary a film as Mel Brooks' later Young Frankenstein. The film was written by Polanski and G&eacute;rard Brach, who also worked with Polanski on Repulsion. The acting, given its small field of play, is solid, and the best of all is the loopy professor, played by MacGowran. Although his career was mainly in high profile dramas like Tom Jones and Doctor Zhivago, his comic talent shines. Polanski is not nearly up to it as his assistant. However, Alfie Bass, as Shagal, the Jewish vampire, gets off some of the best schtick and scenes. The rest of the actors do little to distinguish themselves. Tate is attractive enough, and the father and son vampires, played by Mayne and Quarrier, are generic.<br />  However, for every slapstick gag that works- such as Alfred's escaping Herbert by running all around a balcony and back to Herbert, whom he gets away from by biting the vampire on his ear, there are one or two that fall flat, and these only pad out the film and make it too long; thus why the studio's cuts actually worked. The narrative of The Fearless Vampire Killers, such as it is, is less of a tale than a setup for gags. Yet, it is a likable little film, and shows Polanski at his lightest and most whimsical; something which is as rare as a scare from Christopher Lee.comedy.

B000HEVZ6W|5.0|\\"Gattaca\\" was originally released in 1997 with very little publicity, but instantly collected a dedicated fanbase. Today, two decades later, the growing fanbase of this science fiction drama has dubbed it one of the most creative and unique perspectives on the future, and they're right.    Director Andrew Niccol paints the picture of a future where humans are valued for little more than their DNA structures. Prospective employees must give blood samples as part of their initial interview process, allowing employers to unfairly discriminate against applicants with undesireable DNA structures (poor health, balding, heart problems, etc.). Into this picture Niccol paints Vincent, an underdog \\"degenerate\\" who will do whatever it takes to achieve his dream job: working at Gattaca Aerospace Center and flying into outter space. As the story unfolds, the audience sees just how far Vincent is willing to go to make his dreams a reality, and the consequences that arise from his actions.     \\"Gattaca\\" entices its audience with an interesting storyline, and then delivers throughout the rest of the film with beautiful cinematography, well-rounded characters, and plot twists that make for an overall incredible expereince.
B0001L3LUE|5.0|Errol Morris came to fame in the late 1980s with his anti-police corruption documentary The Thin Blue Line, and has spent the last couple decades gracing cinephiles with controversial, yet distinguished, films. Last year's Oscar-winning documentary The Fog Of War: Eleven Lessons From The Life Of Robert S. McNamara is his best yet, and one of the best films- documentary or not- ever made. It works as a history of the American Military of the last 50 years, and a personal portrait of ex-Defense Secretary Robert McNamara, architect of the Vietnam War, not to mention a philosophical foray into the nature of man and evil.<br />  Yet, delineated as those 3 points are, the film is not dogmatic. McNamara is not portrayed as sympathetic, although sometimes he elicits sympathy- his love and loss felt at the murder of JFK, nor dogmatic, although his actions in the film and out belie that, and led to his being fired by LBJ. Morris takes an effective tack by parsing the film as 11 lessons from McNamara- a very Oriental approach to a life. This is also reflected in the fact that the film rarely answers questions, in the general or specific, rather intent on making its viewers think. Great art usually provokes queries, not smoothes with answers.<br />  Thus the film's essence and its title, which refers to the chaotic complexity, therefore unpredictability, inherent in war.<br />This film has got to be the shortest 105 minutes in film history for, if the deleted scenes (culled from over 20 hours of interviews) are any clue this film should more properly have been a PBS miniseries. There are probably only a literal dozen or so films that will have relevance and cogence in 1000 years. This is one of them. Watch it. Understand it. Absorb it. If you don't you are likely to be as regretful as its prime subject.

It's a combination of all the great classic riffs merged with their polished techniques to create an excellent album. I think the production is good and the music is very well layered. This has got to be the most \\"rifftastic\\" recording the band has done to date. Oh, and Kirk is back! I mean the return of the classic Metallica guitar solo... There are some hard and unstopable rhythms dueling against noodly twists and turns of a great Heavy Metal quartet. And the return of the epic Metallica instrumental song called Suicide & Redemption simply rocks!    The CD package is cool. The coffin and grave die cut into various images in black and white is very deep and moving. And the classic Metallica logo is back, too.

I had read the directions before I used the sweeper, so I was careful not to overcharge the battery, but it is completely dead now anyway.

B00192KCQ0|4.0|Death Magnetic is solid Metal-Pop Rock hybrid genre.  It's not true thrash like the old stuf (save for \\"My Appocalypse\\" which returns to Kill 'em All roots), and it's not fully Pop rock like the Load albumbs before it.  Death Magnetic seem to borrow the same attitude infused by St. Anger.      Basically Death Magnetic is Metallica comming full circle, with the best of the past and present.     Death Magnetic songs were created to satisfy the mainstream public while keeping their core metal head fans happy.  It's not easy. A lot of core metal fans beleive that metallica stabed them in the back.  Foolish words from fools too foolish to realise that no metal band can ever to even dream of becoming sucessfull as Metallica.  Metallica would not be Metallica if that was the case and no one would care.      I like hard heavy crunching rifts, which is why i like St. Anger even though it was no where near thrash metall. I don't like people who think good metal is because it's fast. I listened to Slayer, Canibal Corpse, Napal Death, SlipKnot. Speed is nothing if you can't tell one track from the next.      Metallica can transend even higer with the Guitar Hero and Rock Band generation of fans.

031606792X|2.0|First Person:  When I first read the book, I was happy for Bella, she got what she wanted and made a huge sacrifice.... or at least I thought she did. Bella turned out to have THEE perfect life EVER, she has Edward, Nessie, a cute little house and a unlimited amount of money. the book left far too many lose ends, I was soooo dissapointed I couldn't even read past page 436. It's just not realistic, and it sends a horrible message to teens!        I started reading another book that was almost an copy of Twilight, and it made ten years before the whole series! The book was called the Vampire diaries, EVERYTHING had the same ideas and the vampires fall in love with a girl with a great fragrance!          I dont think Edwards the one to blame for the kid, because bella begged and begged for you know what. ALso in the book it says that they do it every night in bed, I find that sick and disturbing, CANT NESSIE HEAR!    Second Person:  For me, the book was just annoying and horrible.  I cried twice during it of disappointment.  Once when she became pregnant and the second time at the end.  I was just so distraught about the story line.  IT WAS NOT THE WAY I HAD EXPECTED IT!!!  Why did she have to have a kid, at age 18, right after they got married?  WHY???????!!!!!!!  Rosalie ticks me right off.  She just wants the kid, she is not helping Bella, she just wants the kid.  DUH!  The almost war scene was maddening, because all they did was talk and then when the war almost started, they decided to go back home.  wow.  STUPID!  Bella is such a child, and even when I was reading Twilight, I kept wondering why the heck Edward loves her.  She is one word.  Selfish.  It's almost like she is using Edward to get what she wants and what she wants is NOT the kid, (if you know what I mean)  So if you take our advice please read the first three and stop.  BYE!!!!!!
B000QFAJ7S|4.0|I'm in my early 30s and am not much of a mainstream pop music person generally. I find it  canned and cliche for the most part. I love Kelly Clarkson's  music, though. I'd been  thinking of buying this CD for a while and am very glad I finally did. It has been in heavy rotation for about a month and I'm pretty impressed.  Some of the criticisms I'd read about it being a little heavier and a little darker were actually things I thought I would like and that proved to be true. Lots of loss and betrayal and longing and grappling, which is what I'm up to these days in my personal life.  So many of the emotions and lyrics on this CD resonate with me on a very specific and personal level. Some might say the whole  CD is  an expansion of \\"Beautiful Disaster,\\" which  is a  tremendously powerful and bitter sweet song, very emotional  and walking the line where pleasure meets pain.  Kelly Clarkson  is a passionate singer with tremendous  talent.  This CD is not exactly a walk in the park on a sunny day, but  it comes across authentic to me as far as being a little deeper and brooding and capturing a lot of  struggle and difficult emotions.  There are only two songs on this CD I don't like.  \\"Yeah\\" just seems like a mess.  It could be sexy but somehow it just doesn't come together quite right.  Maybe it'll grow on me. It just kind of seems like fluff in my opinion.  I don't like \\"One Minute\\" either. It doesn't seem to fit with the rest of the CD and just seems kind of random to me.  It reminds  me of that Madonna song \\"Ray of Light\\" for some reason soundwise.  Those songs keep this from being a five star CD, in my opinion, though other songs certainly make up for them. I don't like \\"How I Feel\\"  as much as some others. It reminds me of  Pat Benatar's  voice and music. That's not a bad thing. I think Pat Benetar is incredible.  The song is just a  little too pop singleish for me, though I can't argue with her jaded sentiments. I could take or leave the hidden track \\"Chivas,\\" aswell. Stand out favorites for me are \\"Sober,\\" \\"Maybe,\\" \\"Be Still,\\" and \\"Irvine.\\"  \\"Maybe\\" is my favorite. It is very emotional and the words  connect with a lot of my own feelings right now.  It  seems really honest, passionate, and vulnerable. It is like a cry from the soul of  desperate hope. That sounds like a snip of bad adolescent poetry, but I said it.  The song really does seem like that. \\"Judas\\"  is closely linked with some of my feelings,  as is \\"Don't Waste My Time.\\" All that mixed  up emotional stuff around, \\"You  hurt me so much but I  still love and want you and don't know what to do with all these feelings\\" stuff. \\"Be Still\\" is very radio friendly, I think, and  kind of tender and seductive and relaxing.  The song kind of seduces you and sucks you in and is the only tranquil and happy  song on the CD. It doesn't fit well for that reason but it really is  pretty and would be a good\\"making love' song, I think. \\"Sober\\" was the first song to get my attention.  Deep lyrics with  sincere emotion.  I don't know if Kelly Clarkson has actually had a substance abuse issue, but she sings the song like someone  who  really knows what that struggle can be like.  \\"Irvine\\" seems very personal and I  appreciate the honest and spiritual  aspects of the song, though it is melancholy.  Moments such as that song, as well as \\"Haunted,\\"   make me think Amy Lee. I make that comparison favorably.  I  love Amy Lee. I love \\"Never Again\\" in that Alanis Morisette \\"You Oughta Know\\" angry kind of way.    I saw her perform it on American Idol and thought two things. One was, \\"Wow, that girl can sing.\\"  The other was, \\"Wow, that girl is angry.\\" I didn't watch American Idol the first season and  didn't pay much attention to Kelly Clarkson until \\"Break Away\\" came out.  I  still play that CD  quite a bit and think  it is extremely good.  On both of these CDs, Kelly Clarkson's vocal ability is very well showcased, as is her ability to show  raw emotion and still sing well.  She is  justone of those people who could sing almost anything, I think.  She  possesses tremendous  talent as a vocalist and  I respect that a lot. She always seems to be saying, \\"I'm kind of a mess\\" on this CD, and there was some of that on \\"Break Away,\\" such as with \\"Because of You.\\"   Kelly Clarkson just seems more serious and cynical than your average teeny bopper pop star. She's a little more troubled, I think, and  willing to  express some hard feelings and experiences.  That is very real. I appreciate the authenticity and believe her to have substance as well as talent.  This is a CD very much worth  owning.
0385340990|1.0|Okay, this might possibly be a \\"me\\" problem, but the format of the book is too difficult for my narrative linear mind to follow.  I'm a firm believer that if one can't find interest in the book after 2 chapters, then it should be put away. So it's found a nice resting point on my bookshelf, and one day when I feel like wrapping my brain around something a little different, perhaps it will be brought back out.  However, as a reader who needs more, this book just isn't for me.  When reading becomes a chore, like housework, I'll put it off.
B001AEF6BI|5.0|I remember the first time I ever seen this movie. I was about 7 or 8 and my sister had rented it on VHS. I didn't know what it was all about, but I was in for the best treat!! Today's seniors would benefit from watching this movie!!

0393061310|4.0|Jared Diamond is a professor of physiology at the UCLA School of Medicine, he expanded into evolutionary biology and biogeography. This book attempts to explain why certain parts of the world became predominant given the basic equality of humanity (p.16). Diamond questions whether \\"civilization\\" is better (p.18). It brings a longer life span, less murder, better medical care, etc. Are \\"Stone Age\\" peoples more intelligent than industrialized peoples (p.19)? [The former are not misinformed by the corporate media.] There is a difference between densely populated societies and sparsely populated societies (p.21). \\"History followed different courses for different peoples because of differences among peoples' environments, not because of biological differences among the peoples themselves\\" (p.23). When Diamond talks about modern events you can see his faults. The Cuban Missile Crisis was in 1962 (p.279). There was no \\"isolationism\\" in the US as per the Briand-Kellogg Pact (p.412). That problem of \\"China's unity\\" is really the faults of any monopoly (p.413). That applies to the transistor as well (p.417).    The basis for development is to produce enough food to support craft specialists who develop technologies. This leads to governments, large nations, armies, wars of conquest, navies, and fleets for colonies. Diamond identifies several groups of environmental factors to explain the history of the world for the past 13,000 years (p.31). Can a single book provide all the answers? There was a huge change in human capabilities about fifty to a hundred millenia ago (p.40). [The simplest explanation for the demise of animals is the consumption of their eggs and young by humans (p.43).] Chapter 2 tells about the Maori invasion of the Chatham Islands in December 1835. They exterminated the Moriori people (p.53). This shows how environments affect human societies (p.54). Diamond compares Polynesian societies to show the effects of the environment (p.58). The population had the same ancestral society yet their cultural differences are explained by their varying environment (p.65).    Chapter 4 explains why agriculture and livestock are the foundation for human advancement. Both require more labor than in hunting-gathering societies (p.105). Livestock that give milk provide more calories than from a slaughtered animal. Vegetables and animals are adapted to the climate by latitude (p.184). Diseases limited the range of domesticated animals (pp.186-187). Diseases are spread by livestock and pet animals (Chapter 11). Until WW II diseases killed more soldiers than battle (p.197). European cities had a higher death rate than rural villages before the 20th century (p.205). Writing transmits knowledge with accuracy, quantity, and detail (Chapter 12). Is Diamond correct about Iraqi literacy (p.216)? Weren't Europeans more advanced in nuclear science (p.225)?    Diamond's comments about inventions are wrong or misleading (p.243). Otto invented his engine to provide power from a waste product from oil refining (p.247). Henry Ford `invented' the automobile specifically to replace horses (p.243). Steam locomotives were designed to replace horses and their expensive fodder. Diamond is wrong about the supersonic transport (p.249). You could buy a Dvorak keyboard if people wanted them (p.248); just as a country could drive with a steering wheel on the right. Chapter 18 summarizes this book. Chapter 19 tells about the peoples and languages of Africa. Diamond seems very sure in describing events from 5,000 years ago when he wasn't present as an observer. The condensed version of this book made an interesting movie on TV. This book should have fewer pages by eliminating redundant or extraneous material, and be faster paced. I wonder if there are any opposing viewpoints to his opinions?
B00192KCQ0|4.0|First of all I became a Metallica fan after hearing MOP many years after it was released somewhere around in 92.  At that point I was quickly introduced to the Black album, along with Justice.  Years later I heard Kill 'em all and Lightning for the first time. So about the time I was getting into Metallica was during the break between Black and Load.  I was first struck by the difference between Justice and the Black album.  Where only hints of thrash remained and what turned out to be a harbinger of what was to come in future releases.  Then came Load which was a total abandonment of their old classic style. Then Reload came out and was more of the same.  Then came Garage Inc.  I remember a friend of mine at work and I would keep saying Track 7 which was our instant favorite of the album which of course is a collection of Merciful Fate covers.  The overall sound showed they could still rock but for whatever reason chose not to play that style.  S&M came out and it was interesting mix between orchestra and Metallica, it was nice to hear old tracks with a bit of a twist and of the two new songs the best was easily No Leaf Clover.      Then the band went through what can only be described as probably the roughest period in their existence aside from Cliff's death.  The promise of the next album getting back to their roots, growing dissension amongst band members, Jason's exit from the band, James rehab, among other psychological issues.  When I saw the documentary \\"Some Kind of Monster\\" really shed light on why St. Anger was the way it was, and it could have been titled St. Chaos.  I saw a band that was on the brink of splitting up and going down in flames to end a career that showed so much promise years ago.      Then slowly but surely things started to fit into place.  Rob seems to be a great fit for the band that sorely needed a lift.  Bob Rock gone, in comes Rick Rubin who's reputation proceeds him.  Started by encouraging them to listen to their old stuff, and the bands that influenced them at the time they wrote their classic albums.  He encouraged them to get to the \\"essence\\" of Metallica and not be afraid to go there.  Watching the fly on the wall vids on youtube I see a band that seems more cohesive than they have been in a long time, a band that seems to be having fun again.  That I think is when Metallica is at it's best.  They have done what I thought was no longer possible.  The stage was set, I'd heard it all before \\"this next album we are getting back to our roots.\\" I'd heard it before and had all but lost hope that there was any truth to it anymore as it now seemed like a promotional ploy to raise excitement about a new album.  Then I heard bits and pieces, trailers, fly on the wall clips and the more I heard the more intrigued I was.  Could they finally be getting back to their roots, would this new album actually deliver on a promise that's been held out like a carrot for years now.  In short it does just that.  Death Magnetic delivers in spades.  Having not experienced their classics when they were released this to me is like hearing Puppets, Justice, or Lightning for the first time.  It's an assault on the senses in a good way. There is not a single song on this album I don't like.  I do agree that The Unforgiven III could have been titled something completely different and I doubt I'd have even made the connection other than it being a ballad type song.  Actually the intro chord sequence reminds me more of Ecstasy of Gold that is played at the beginning of their concerts.  There are bits of the two new songs that they played on tour that could be heard on youtube also known as Death is Not The End and Vulturous.  Back are the longer songs, shredding solos, harmony guitars, racing riffs, well crafted interplay between lead and rhythm, no paint can drums.  I'll go back to what Rubin referred to as the Essence of Metallica.  DM has many similarities to Kill, Lightning, Puppets, and Justice, but at the same time stands on it's own as different.  They have brought elements and the spirit of previous albums and meshed them into a fresh sound that has the feel of their classic stuff.  If I had to make a comparison it's probably most along the lines of Puppets as it shows the progressive side of their sound and the direction they were taking with the Puppets album.  Cliff's death changed that.  Who knows what the follow up to Puppets would have been had Cliff not died.  Who knows what or where Metallica would be if Cliff were still alive.  In some ways I think they were as afraid to to go near the sound Cliff had helped form.    I will say that I like all their albums and that does include St. Anger (though it took a lot of patients to actually get past it's many flaws).  I don't see the point in maintaining a stand of \\"if it doesn't sound like \\"insert album name here\\" then I will dismiss it as crap or a sell-out.  I enjoy a broad range of music and can appreciate the different albums.  I kept thinking when it seemed like everyone was hating load/reload that if that album had been released by some other group people wouldn't be ripping it like they are.  To an extend Metallica had painted itself into a corner that changing from thrash or heavy metal to any other less aggressive style would be bound to alienate fans. But to rip on them for trying something different is going to far.  That said I couldn't be happier that they've returned to what they do best and that make an in your face assault on your senses album.  DM has been like ear candy if I can put it that way.      I have to give Metallica credit, I along with many others had all but written them off as a group of hasbeens who's best days were in their past.  Bands have broken up under much less stress than Metallica endured during the St. Anger recording.  Kudos to them for sticking it out and enduring.  Sometimes you have to hit the bottom before you can rise up.

B00004W50T|5.0|This is one of the most emotive, eclectic and soulful albums ever. Some who have discovered this album in recent years have complained about its (to their ears) 'under-produced' sound and raw edges. As the sleeve note explains, the album was written and recorded in the basement of Big Pink, the house that had played host to the rambling sessions now known as The Basement Tapes. This album is not the gleaming product of a TV talent show; it was not thrown together by a group of businessmen, knowing all about making money and nothing about making music.    The Band were five musicians who were already veterans of The Road. This was their first opportunity to display their collective musical knowledge and virtuosity. The playing and singing throbs with passion and energy.    I return to this album again and again, and I'm always enthralled. Go back to your TV stodge if you can't handle real music by real musicians. You don't deserve this.
B00192KCQ0|3.0|The music sounds like segments taken or borrowed from their previous albums, mostly AJFA.    New lyrics? Sure, yet the vocals are of a similar delivery reminiscent of St. Anger.      I, being a fan, did not want AJFA II, nor St. Anger II, and surely I am not looking forward to Death Magnetic II.     Metallica should have thought long and hard before releasing this, evaluating the strengths and weaknesses of the recording.     It may not just be the engineering of the album, yet the players themselves, that are to blame for this lackluster release.    The songs sound thrown together and lack originality.     Note:   I am amending my original one star review to three stars. Since my previous review I have softened my harsh review and view of Death Magnetic in general. Though not their best work, by far, and not their worst, yet close, there are some good songs on this album. That Was Just Your Life, Broken, Beat and Scarred and All Nightmare Long, are highlights on the album.
B000RZGIQ8|5.0|I liked the original version of Top Gun, but in Blu-ray it's stunning. The sound track is just great - just make sure the neighbors are out before you play it, because the temptation to turn up the volume when those jet take off is overwhelming.    Typical Tom Cruise movie - but great fun, and excellent in High Def format.    A great addition to your Blu-Ray collection if you liked the original.

I could excuse just one, but after finding three I was annoyed.  It seems like it would take a good editor only 5 minutes to read through and correct the story, but apparently that did not happen with this particular book.
B0019EXZYE|2.0|I found the action a bit like a \\"set in the UK\\" version of the Ocean's XX trilogy. A little deja vu for me. What did intrigue me was the claim that it was based on a true story.    There are better movies of this genre out there, at least for me.
B000JMK6LC|5.0|I had a dentist appointment in Toms River, NJ on 9/11/2001. I watched, like many, in horror, at the events unfolding in NYC, and was completely devastated. Like many, I know exactly where I was, what my mom said to me, when she put on the news, and I saw the planes hit the towers on CNN. It was impossible, and ubelievable at the time.<br /><br />Since then, I've made it a point to become more involved in world events to understand all of the \\"behind the scenes\\" structure, and international events/politics, not just those on American soil to gain perspective on how horrible things like this can happen here and around the world.<br /><br />Although I can't imagine the pain that families who didn't know if their sons, daughters, lovers, sisters, friends and others, had perished, I have felt loss. This film captures at least some of this horrendous anxiety that was felt in the US, and specifically for everyone directly affected. I just watched this film, today,  9 years after the events (I previously also saw United 93).<br /><br />Sgtrictly from a cinematic standpoint, and as an avid hi-def collector, The PQ and sound on the HD DVD are spectacular and it's the special features that really make this story even more real. As an East Coast resident, it was too soon for me, to watch this in theaters. As an avid NYC visitor, I have friends who work or have friends/relatives in the area, and when I saw the movie today, for the 1st time, the movie captured the mayhem that they described.<br /><br />I actually think it was a good thing that only a handful of characters were chosen to attempt to tell an uplifting story and provide some focus. I've seen several WTC documentaries, to try to get my mind around this horrible event. Triumphs were rare that day, and unfortunately most of the 4000 total people who died, and their families were not able to celebrate any.<br /><br />This film was supposed to be an exception, a film about the sparse hope and miracles that existed that day. I don't believe you can make a 2 hour film with 40 characters. There were probably many different viewpoints and experiences amidst that chaos and no one can sum all of them up in 2 hours, not even a major director; it may even dilute the film, and create an overwhelming \\"split screen\\" type atmosphere. I felt emotionally invested in the characters, because there was focus.<br /><br />The method of involving a few families,created at least some frame work and representation of the events. And as is the case with all films about real wars, or other current events, the viewpoints, especially amidst chaos, will be as different as the stars in the universe. This was a very touching film, and I highly recommend that you take the time (and emotional energy) to watch it, and the extras, they are worth it.

B001DSNF8C|4.0|There's a dirty secret when it comes to James Bond movies: they all suck. Every single one of them, and we're including the ones starring Sean Connery, who's made more out of less (his accent and bristly but cultured masculinity) than any actor I can think of.<br /><br />They all stank, like rot. Until this one.<br /><br />To begin with, it's not poorly lit, poorly shot, with lethargic \\"action\\" sequences involving cheap explosions and poorly choreographed fight scenes. The lovable institution of \\"Q\\" (always beware of \\"lovable institutions\\") has been dispatched entirely, as have cartoonish demonstrations of \\"cultured living\\" that would appeal only to those with no conception of what \\"cultured\\" and \\"high class\\" actually consist of. (Hint: it has nothing to do with ordering drinks shaken and not stirred, or enjoying Peruvian Blonde coffee from the first beans of the season.)<br /><br />James Bond movies have always appealed to a certain demographic. At least in the US, that was predominantly young, male, and incredibly dumb. Female characters--even the allegedly \\"strong\\" ones--were always soft in the head and punished for any semblance of mental fortitude with unapologetically mysogynistic names like Pussy Galore. (So much for \\"strong female characters\\", it's no wonder that being a \\"Bond Girl\\" is an insult to any serious working actor.)<br /><br />Daniel Craig is a wonder--physically compact and powerful, he's like watching a coiled spring move about the stage. Eva Green, however, is the real standout. Her Vesper Lynd falls for none of Bond's pat lines and surface charms, and is just as bright and quick as he is: his initial attempt to establish the alpha-male position in their relationship is quickly upended entirely, with a sharp riposte that set the tone for the rest of the movie.<br /><br />Given this latest turn in the franchise, and its rightful place as The Only Good Bond Movie Ever Made, I wait with no small anticipation for the latest release, Quantum Solace.

B00005JPY0|4.0|After \\"Batman Begins\\", True Believers everywhere held out hope that the Batman \\"franchise\\" could be vitalized. Every single Batman film (from the fraudulent Mr. Burton onward) up until \\"Batman Begins\\" was irredeemable trash on its best day.<br /><br />True Be lievers need not be disappointed. Though the 'origin story' of Bruce Wayne-qua-Batman left something to be desired, it was, at last, dark enough, and scary enough, to be believed.<br /><br />Let's begin with Christian Bale. In addition to being a talented actor and great looking, he's able to strike the balance that the Bruce Wayne of Frank Miller had to strike: playboy, millionaire, ill at ease in high-falutin' situations. Wayne should move easily in rarefied air, and carries on his shoulders the mantle of his father's legacy. As an orphan, however, he cannot ever move easily at those heights and instead cultivates the declasse mannerisms of the parvenu. He is the Prince of Orphans, and plays it effectively.<br /><br />Bale's \\"Batman\\" is physically menacing, and dispenses entirely with Kilmer's Boy Scout veneer and Keaton's pure idiocy. He's a true heart as well, which gets lost in the focus on the psychopathia that a vigilante would have to actually wear just under the skin.<br /><br />Much has been made of Heath Ledger's performance of the Joker, and well it should be. Though I was determined not to enjoy it, Ledger wears the mantle of the Joker with a frightening authenticity. Matching him with pretty boy Eric Roberts was a masterful stroke; his veiled psychopathy counters with the cultured pretense of the old world mobster role. There's no comparison between Nicholson's \\"Joker\\" to Ledger's. Nicholson's characterization was of a cartoonish oaf; Ledger's Joker is a strange and frightening fuel-air mix of pure combustion. To be sure, the writing is outstanding and plays upon the \\"You Made ME!\\" Gothic trope. It's beautifully executed by Messrs. Nolan and Nolan.<br /><br />Aaron Eckhart also redeems the Harvey Dent character. Played (and the emphasis is on \\"played\\") earlier by Tommy Lee Jones, Eckhart's Two-Face is rooted in an idealism run afoul. There's no mystery to Two-Face's murderous spree, and the course is set between bespoiled honor and heroism in Batman's ultimate flight. Messrs. Nolan clearly were the first to take Frank Miller's limning of Batman as an outlaw. It's about time, and I'm jealous of you if you are about to see the results for the first time.hasis is on \\"played\\") earlier by Tommy Lee Jones, Eckhart's Two-Face is rooted in an idealism run afoul.

B001G7CAGI|5.0|The bar was set high for Fringe after the impressive pilot, and the second episode only builds on the excitement millions have already latched onto. The opening scenes of the first episode were gruesome and intense to be sure, but nothing compared to what we get in the first four minutes of round two. Witnessing a woman conceive, carry a baby full term, and deliver via C-section all in the span of a few minutes is every bit as shocking as you might imagine. The doctors' and nurses' reactions in surgery, mixed with the groaning (yes groaning) of the newborn work together to give us one of the most chilling scenes in network TV history. It's almost as if the writers are saying, \\"Guess what? This show is intense and no telling what we will throw at you next!\\"    Early on I was quite surprised to see Broyles meeting with a select group of higher ups as he introduced his new team. Who was among that group? None other than the Terminator arm toting Massive Dynamic COO Nina Sharp herself. I can't wait to see how this relationship plays out as more light is shed on The Pattern and all who are involved in it. Massive Dynamic CEO William Bell is yet to be seen and I don't expect we will see him for awhile. The creators of Fringe have even said in a recent podcast that the actor they have cast as Bell doesn't even know he is playing Bell. Whatever that means....    I loved the story in this episode, and especially the mix of \\"fringe science\\" and investigative techniques used to track down the killer. While these unorthodox methods are incredibly far-fetched, I still can't help but buy into the \\"what if\\" factor. This is a formula we can be sure to expect in each new installment and I'm excited to see the creative ideas the writers have in store for us.     The strong characters we fell in love with in the pilot are in top form throughout this episode. Olivia Dunham's infectious search for truth is captivating and inviting. John Noble continues to give a stellar performance as the highly eccentric Dr. Bishop. This is a truly disturbed and damaged character that tugs at our heart strings all the while amazing us with his superior intellect. The biggest surprise for me so far has to be Joshua Jackson's performance as Peter Bell. Jackson gives this character the perfect balance of humor, wit, and compassion that make Peter so engaging. At the end of the episode we see a softer, yet welcome side to Peter as he sings his father to sleep.     The relationship between Peter and Walter is one of the most interesting aspects of the show, and it looks like things just became even more interesting. I had my suspicions in the pilot that all was not as it seemed between father and son. For instance, something about the way Walter kept trying to check Peter's vitals throughout the episode seemed especially odd. In The Same Old Story there is one very interesting scene where Walter shares information with Olivia about Peter's past and the nature of their relationship. My guess? I wouldn't be surprised to find out that Peter is much more than Walter's son....more like his creation.     So many questions. So many theories. And alas, this is only the second episode! I am so, so hooked...
6305308659|5.0|Pleasantville is more than just a small-town piece of Americana trapped in a time warp that is fixated on the conservatively clean-cut 1950's, it is a small fictional town that finds itself struggling with social issues that are all too real and timeless for those who continue to struggle with their divisive influences. Racism, bigotry, artistic and intellectual censorship, conformity without question or debate, non-conformity with purpose and hope, and the struggle for individuality are all beautifully and sensitively illustrated though filmic metaphors and touching performances in this family film. Whether you are one who has always found comfort and security conforming to the assertive voices and visions of others or know the personal struggle of leaving comfort to secure and assert your own voice and vision in a world that doesn't always agree, this is a poignant film that is highly capable of striking a chord in the hearts of us all.
B000Q6GUW0|5.0|Dexter Season One was in my opinion is a great show, I have already gotten three other people to start watching it and they all agree.  Highly original, Michael C. Hall is perfect for the role as Dexter.  I also recommend the books the show is based off of by Jeff Lindsey.
B000FVQLQQ|5.0|A Beautiful Mind is one of those rare movies that grace the silver screen once in a lifetime and touch our hearts and our minds in ways that other films which have attempted to replicate with similar material, have yet to achieve. For years movie goers have witnessed the world of mental illness and its horrors from an outside perspective, much like visitors to a zoo, observing life in captivity from the other side of the cage. With faithful attention to detail and a respectful compassion for a world not yet understood in its unending complexities director Ron Howard draws the audience into a world of mystery, deception and intrigue, far removing us from our comfort zones. Then, as suddenly as it all began, the rug is ripped out from under our feet, forcing us to accept the fact that a world into which we have been drawn is not always a world that others can see.     This is the basic technique of filmmaking which Ron Howard skillfully exploits throughout the film to powerfully illustrate the emotional and psychological impact of John F. Nash's schizophrenia, a mental illness that is often characterized by disturbing delusions, hallucinations and bizarre thought patterns. As one who has suffered from mental illness for nearly thirty years I personally recommend this film not merely for its intellectual and artistic delivery of the subject matter but primarily for its overall sensitivity to an issue that has remained a subject of personal controversy in many circles of conversation, even in a century revolutionized by constant scientific discoveries and the evolutionary restructuring of psychiatric treatment.
B00192KCQ0|5.0|Metallica's recent release \\"Death Magnetic\\" is an excellent return to form.  This record falls between ...And Justice for All and Black.  Forget the atrocious St. Anger and the Black extensions Load and Re-Load.  While the Load records were good records, they songs all sounded like they came from the Black recording sessions and just released B-sides and throwaways and called them Load and Re-Load.  St. Anger, on the other hand, was a joke.  Death Magnetic sees the band resurfacing with the type of songs that made them popular back in 1984/1985/1986.  If you are just getting into Metallica, by all means start with And justice for all, ride the lightning, or black.  Then get this.  You'll thank me later.    Awesome record - ******
B000002UB6|4.0|Many reviews go over the context of this album, with the band beginning to come apart at the seams, the production work of Phil Spector, and so on.  Since that has been dealt with at considerable length, I'll just focus on my responses to the music.<br /><br />The start of this is so quirky! I always enjoyed it.  If I have it right:<br /><br />\\"'I dig a pygmy,'<br />By Charles Hawtrey and the DefAids.<br />Part 1,<br />In which Doris gets her oats.\\"<br /><br />I haven't the faintest clue what it means, but it is a good humored introduction.  Then, into the first song--\\"Two of Us.\\" This is one of the \\"smaller\\" songs on this CD, but still a bunch of fun! The instrumental work is clean and spare and nice to listen to. Indeed, there are a number of other lesser known works, a number of which are interesting and fun (e.g., \\"Dig a Pony\\" or \\"I've Got a Feeling\\").<br /><br />One of the finest of the Beatles songs--\\"Let It Be.\\" This is one of my personal favorites from their body of work. Neat line:<br /><br />\\"When I find myself in trouble,<br />Mother Mary comes to me<br />Speaking words of wisdom,<br />'Let it be.'\\"<br /><br />The piano and organ backing is rather spare and effective.<br /><br />\\"Long and Winding Road.\\" I enjoy the song, even though it is--in my view--way overdone (Phil Spector gone mad!). Still, it is an effective work (it's interesting to compare this version with a \\"stripped down\\" version available elsewhere, as per other reviews).<br /><br />Another of my favorites--\\"Get Back.\\" There is an enjoyable start, with the Beatles bantering. Then, the familiar opening music leading into a wonderful song, well sung.<br /><br />So, not the best of the Beatles. But, I think, underrated by many. Still worth a listen.
B00009YXHN|5.0|Howard P. Lovecraft was a writer of horror fiction that not everyone has a taste for.  Those who do enjoy his stories, though, admit that some of his better stories have been made into mediocre films (such as The Dunwich Horror).  However, the reverrse is also true, and his short story, \\"Herbert West -- The Reanimator!\\", was one such.  The story is relatively dull, but the film it eventually spawned is gory, but a lot of fun, with Jeffrey Combs making a perfect Herbert West.  The film led to a sequel, which is \\"Bride.\\"<br /><br />The sequel carries on the saga of Herbert West, who has developed a serum that can reanimate corpses and their parts.  The unfortunate death of a young woman doesn't deter Herbert West -- he decudes to rebuild her from various body parts that he sticks together and uses his reanimation serum on.  This is, of course, complicated by the return of a nemesis from the previous film, an academic who wants to plagiarize West's work and present it as his own (notwithstanding that his reanimated head has been decapitated).<br /><br />The film is characterized as a horror film, but it's as much comedic as gory.  Not for every taste, but a lot of fun.  For best appreciation, its predecessor should be viewed first.
B0000YEEHG|4.0|Two beautiful actresses, almost identical in their physical appearance, bettle it out on screen.  Liv Ullman plays an actress, Elizabeth, who during stage play goes silent (probably every director's nightmare).  There is nothing wrong with her physically or empotionally according to the doctor, so she is assigned a young nurse Alma (Bibi Anderson) to take care of her.  There is no need for them to stay in the hospital, so doctor let's them use her summer house in hopes that fresh air and rest will aid patient's recovery from the unexplainable illness.  As two women settle in house, it is amazing to see them interact in spite of the fact that Elizabeth does not speak at all and the young nurse is doing all the talking.  As the time goes by, it is the young nurse who opens herself up bare to her silent companion.  It is almost as if their roles are reversed.  As long kept secrets keep pouring out, the initial tenderness between two of them turns into violence and cruelty both verbal and physical.  It turns that solitude and deep reflection are cracking their personalities in the ways neither one of them expected.  Or could it be, that the two personalities are part of one that imagines it all as a form of self-healing?  Reconciling one's life is never easy, so it is not surprising the we witness all the psychological twists unfold in front of us.  Deeply intelectual film that can have many meanings, it is quiet, but not slow and engaging from start to finish.  We really want to know what will come out of these characters at the end.

B00005V1Y0|4.0|Once you get past the fact that this films plot is nothing more than regurgitated clich&eacute;s you can actually enjoy the film for what it isn't; generic.  Yes, the plot may be entirely unoriginal but there is nothing formulaic about the delivery.  Baz Luhrmann has a very distinct style; one that either repulses or engages the audience.  We've seen this style manifest in his infectious take on `Romeo + Juliet' and of course in his big hit `Moulin Rouge!' but his style is working overtime in his debut film `Strictly Ballroom'.  With sporadic bursts of flare and imagery, `Strictly Ballroom' dances around the audience like a flamenco dancer on speed, and this works wonders in making this film feel fresh and new despite the fact that, when stripped of its visionary delivery, its not new at all.<br /><br />The film tells the story of Scott Hastings, a championship ballroom dancer who is bucking the system by insisting on dancing his own steps instead of the standard dance steps forced on him by the dance committee.  His mother Shirley is up in arms about what to do with him.  She at one time was a famous dancer herself and lost out on her shot at gold and just wants her son to have what she never had; but his arrogance is standing in the way of her dream.  When his dance partner leaves him because of his stubbornness he finds himself training Fran, the homely girl who is just a beginner at dance, to be his partner.<br /><br />The film follows that same formula of boy meets girl, girl isn't too pretty but cleans up nice, girl learns moves, boy learns humility, boy and girl have rocky patch in relationship, boy and girl reconcile, boy and girl turn heads; but it's the getting there that is so unique and refreshing.<br /><br />Baz incorporates his breed of storytelling (which is something I've found a lot of in Australian cinema, they are very bright and loud and all over the place) in `Strictly Ballroom' with dynamic results.  The dancing is not as flamboyant as I would have expected (and I was rather let down by the final dance scene) but each scene is infused with enough spontaneity to make up for any lack of flare in the dancing.<br /><br />The acting is very good, hilarious and heartwarming.  Paul Mercurio is excellent as Scott and Tara Morice (who looks a lot like Samantha Morton and Emily Watson) is flawless as Fran; truly captivating and endearing.  Bill Hunter and Pat Thomson are hysterical as Scott's mother and coach who are determined to see him win gold, and Barry Otto is nicely used, if a bit out of place, as Doug, Scott's father.<br /><br />The script really gives the actors a lot to work with and they all put their best foot forward in making `Strictly Ballroom' a memorable and entertaining experience.  It's loud and vivacious and totally in-your-face, and this works.  If you are a fan of Luhrmann's more famed work then this is one you will want to check out.  Luhrmann has a way of taking the familiar (face it, even `Moulin Rouge!' is quite unoriginal) and making it feel all his own, as if we've never seen it before.<br /><br />To be honest, you've never seen this before, at least not done this way; of that you can be sure.have expected (and I was rather let down by the final dance scene) but each scene is infused with enough spontaneity to make up for any lack of flare in the dancing.<br /><br />The acting is very good, hilarious and heartwarming.

His eclectic musical tastes and skill of capturing the \\"feeling\\" of the moment on film are keen.  He's right up there with Randy Newman.  I saw him live on July 1st and his closing song was off of this album!

B000W91RUG|4.0|This DVD set is pretty much a \\"what you saw on TV is what you get, sans commercials\\" affair.  That isn't a bad thing at all, but don't expect much in the way of extras.  There are subtitles - in your choice of seven languages - and a largely forgettable 17 minute long behind-the-scenes feature, but that's it.  Actually, you also get a brief free clip from Casablanca.  Unfortunately, it has been transmuted by crude edits into an anti-piracy message.  I suppose a \\"Thank you for your purchase!\\" rather than an implicit indictment for assumed piracy would be expecting a bit much from Warner Brothers.    The show itself is unique and funny.  The potentially formulaic \\"socially inept geeks juxtaposed with attractive girl\\" plot is enlivened by a dialogue rife with smart and subtle science and math jokes that an actual science geek will appreciate and by a characterization of nerds that, while naturally a little over the top in terms of awkwardness and absurdity, often holds some truth.  If you know some nerds, or are one, you may well find yourself watching scenes that are not only funny, but sometimes oddly familiar.  While the humor often stems from the ridiculousness of the genius characters, it doesn't really come at their expense.  In this show the nerds are, at heart, the good guys and aren't even completely lacking in self-awareness.    As with many sitcoms, the laugh track can get annoying at times, but it ultimately doesn't detract too much from the show.  Still, I wouldn't mind seeing DVDs experiment by offering optional audio tracks with the canned laughs omitted.  No luck with that here, though.    In an effort to play up the sexual frustrations of the guys, the show occasionally descends into the crass, but generally maintains a smart and positive tone.  I found some episodes to be better than others but, overall, the show has proved to be very amusing entertainment.  If you have some nerds in your life, there is a good chance you will agree.
B000002LRX|5.0|If you don't own it, you should.  I was lucky enough to have bought it in 1992.  It's survived every move, the USMC, every girlfriend and every CD player until it finally landed on my iPod...where it still gets heavy rotation.    I feel fortunate that I saw FNM tour in support of Angel Dust and I suppose if anything that makes me feel a little old.  If you're thinking about buying it, buy a few and give them to your friends.      It's that good.
B0017R5UAA|5.0|Why did I wait so long to pick this one up? I mean, it's not like they lacked the usual indie world hype. Most of the reviews you'll read are pretty on, using words like earthy, rural, rustic, sweet and warm.      Upon first listening, it was clear that lead vocalist/guitarist Robin Pecknold, was heavily influenced by the Beach Boys (Brian Wilson days, of course). Upon reading the liner notes, this was confirmed by direct references to their music.    This album is good art. Not only is the cover art interesting (Bruegel painting), but the music and lyrics really create and take you into a different world. This album also seems to have a wide appeal. Most people I've shared this album with have absolutely loved it, whether they be absolute music snobs or casual music listeners.     I consider this a 2008 must have.  Fleet Foxes' EP Sun Giant is also worthy of a good listen...or many.
0143038419|1.0|I read this book on the recommendation of my mother...and have rediscovered why I never listen to her advice.  I kept waiting for this idiotic author to discover that if she wasn't so into herself, perhaps her life would be better, but it never happened.  I did enjoy the Italy section (as the food sounds great), but honestly if I met this woman while she was traveling I would have smacked her upside the head.  Her time and money would have been better spent on charity work then this driveling 'look how much i've improved myself' egocentric excuse of a book.  Don't waste your money.
B000ZLFALI|5.0|I love the Beatles and I like how they put their songs together into a story.  They put some different spins on the ideas behind the songs, but it comes out good.
0743424425|5.0|If you don't already know, the story revolves around a family of three, the Torrance family, who are isolated in a remote resort for a few months during the winter. Jack Torrance is hired as the caretaker for the Overlook Hotel. He brings along his wife Wendy and their five year old son Danny, who has the gift of sight. The Overlook has a sordid history and begins to feed off this little family because of Danny's special gift. It begins to use Jack as a way to get to his son.<br /><br />As usual for King, the characterization here is great. You can't help but root for Danny and Wendy and you want to scream for them to get out of the hotel. Jack's descent into madness is slow, yet at the same time somehow frighteningly fast. As a reader, you get to see how his own father affected him. You also get to see how he tries to fight the hotel, part of his psyche is aware of what is going on.<br /><br />Wendy does not see that her husband is going insane until it is too late. She is too concerned with making sure he's not drinking again that she fails to notice he's acting strange. Once she sees that Jack is losing his mind and that Danny is in danger, she steps up and fights for her son. I liked that about her.<br /><br />Danny knows so much due to his psychic gifts, but at five years old, he cannot express it in a way that will save the family. You get a lot of the story through Danny's eyes and this works so well, because in that you get to see what he sees and know what he knows.<br /><br />What really makes this novel stellar is that King makes the Overlook Hotel a living, breathing entity. The Overlook is a character in its own right. Many of King's novels are set in the fictional town of Derry, Maine. There is no Derry here, but the Overlook certainly takes its place. It's an evil place, and even the ghosts within it refer to the Hotel as its own entity. The wind outside is howling, the snow keeps on falling and there is a claustrophobic feel to the story.<br /><br />And the tension within these pages! I was glued to this book, even though I knew what was going to happen since this is a re-read for me.<br /><br />King sets the story up nicely as he takes you inside the Overlook. He makes sure you know the family is good and stranded at the isolated hotel in the midst of snow that is nearly impossible to travel in. And he makes sure you know the hotel is haunted and just why its that way. He makes sure you know all of these scary things before he really begins to terrify you.<br /><br />Now that I've re-read The Shining I definitely feel ready to pick up Dr. Sleep! I'm curious to see what has become of Danny and Wendy.<br /><br />Disclaimer: This review is my honest opinion. I am under no obligation to write a positive review. I purchased my copy of The Shining.And the tension within these pages!

Even though he doesn't understand the words and pictures, he loves the colors, and there is so much to look at that they really entertain him.  The other day he was kind of cranky so I sat in the rocker with him and read two of the books.  He was asleep before I finished the second book, but I kept reading because I wanted to see what happened.  You can't go wrong with these books for children of all ages!
B001DDBCUU|1.0|This movie was horrible.  I mean it, bad writing, bad forced acting, completly predictable I was embarassed for them all.  This should have been a great film but they rushed it out..anyone who liked it is blinded by the series (which was great) but I ask all don't by this DVD and support idiotic filmmaking in the US anymore.  Hollywood thinks they can take a dump in a box and write special edition on it and we will buy it. This was made realitivly cheap and fast thinking who cares the public will buy it and we will get PAID on the backend...so if you want better films made dont buy the bad ones!!! I didn't even want to give it one star

B000002UWF|5.0|There's very little I can add to the previous reviews except to say that this was the reason I bought a CD player years ago.  More out of curiosity than anything else, I happened to pick up a copy of \\"Louis Prima: the Capitol Collectors Series\\" in its audiocassette format back in the early Nineties.  Let me assure you, this is Prima at his best, during the wild and swinging Fifties, when his was \\"THE\\" act to see in Las Vegas. From the opening number, \\"Just A Gigolo,\\" I was hooked.  There isn't a single track (with the possible exception of \\"Beep! Beep!\\") that I didn't enjoy.  The man was a master at his craft.  No one's a bigger fan of Dean Martin's than me, but when you compare Dino's versions of \\"Oh, Marie\\" and \\"Buona Sera\\" to Louis', Prima blows him away. Feeling depressed?  Down in the dumps?  Put on this CD and you'll soon be \\"jump, jive and wailin'\\" along with Louis, his then wife Keely Smith, Sam Butera, and the rest of the Wildest.  Guaranteed!
B001B71NOI|3.0|I've been a NIN fan for years, but am continually disappointed when each new album (post-spiral) is released. There are always a few too many mediocre songs, cliche lyrics and formulaic song structures which get in the way of an otherwise brilliant album.     Of course I'm incredibly pleased to have just downloaded the new 'slip' album (not so new anymore though) and ill be playing it for the next week or so. But it always annoys me when Trent doesn't reach his potential. The main flaws of this album are also characteristic of 'With Teeth' and 'Year Zero' - too many cliche lyrics which Trent has been using for over a decade, and heavy songs which all sound identical (or else lack the artistry and experimental edge of Spiral and Broken). He also needs to put more effort into the drum beats in his songs (they tend to sound way too standardised), which is a surprise considering he's been influenced by guys like aphex twin.       I still hope NiN will one day create an album which does justice to Trent's skills. but even if they dont, they remain a long-lived band with an awesome assortment of great songs (alongside the crappy ones).
B001ACY8D2|5.0|Well, you either love these guys or you don't.    I happen to love them, and I'm all over myself with this CD.    No, this isn't \\"Taak\\" or \\"()\\", but there's much to love and fall in love with this one.    Just listen to it, and enjoy!

B00192KCQ0|2.0|I reviewed St. Anger honestly and I though it was an awful album. I was honestly waiting for Metallica to redeem themselves on this next album. I do not believe they have done so yet.   This review may not be relevant to the occasional metal listeners or the guys into nu metal/alternative rock, as I have grown up on traditional metal such as Iced Earth, Scorpions, Iron Maiden, Priest, Venom et cetera. I would categorize bands like Megadeth and Anthrax in their too. If you are not into bands such as Sabbath, Maiden, Megadeth older Metallica, or other bands that are 100% Heavy Metal, this review may not pertain to you. I understand that most of today's Metallica fans are not metal fans at all, which pains me greatly.   I just want the reader to understand that I am not looking for Ride the Lightning the sequel or Master of Puppets Part 2. I know those days are over and today's Metallica is a different Metallica from that of the 80s. Nonetheless, I still feel this album is flawed.   My major problem with this album is the fact that the song structures do not retain any form of consistency. They seem too sporadic. I applaud James and the gang for being fast, however in this case, the song structures do not do the speed any justice. Secondly, the production here still seems somewhat along the lines of St. Anger. This album is a great improvement over that awful album, however still not quite up there. I do understand that this is NOT Master of Puppets, but Metallica could have done a better job. The drums seem rather dry and the guitars still have that annoying \\"twang\\" to them. The lyrics for the most part do not make sense either. My idea of metal lyrics are that which portray some sort of image. Bands like Mercyful Fate and Bathory do excellent jobs creating images. Metallica did this particularly on Master of Puppets. Unfortunately, the lyrics of Death Magnetic do not make sense at times, particularly on \\"The Day that Never Comes.\\" Again, speed and guitar riffage cannot make up for poor lyrical content. My final complaint with this albums is that the riffs seem too generic. Metallica may need to get a couple of lessons from the Kreator or Testament camp, as these riffs seem too dry lack originality.   The best point of Death Magnetic is the introduction to the Unforgiven III. I feel that this is the most original and fresh part of the album. The rest of the song does not do quite as well, however the piano/orchestral introduction is excellent.   Many non-metal fans believe that this is an excellent album \\"considering their age.\\" Remember friends, AGE MEANS NOTHING IN METAL!!!!If you want solid albums by older bands, pick up new albums by the following: Megadeth, Testament, Saxon, Iron Maiden (I love AMOLAD), Judas Priest, and even the Helloween album is pretty good. I feel that the last greatest Metallica song was No Leaf Clover. That's right friends. I feel it is an excellent piece of music. Nothing from that point has beaten it in my book. I am assuming that the False Metal Fans will enjoy this, however coming from a True Metal viewpoint, this album is not quite as good as other metal albums being released today (keep in mind that I believe that this decade has seen some of the best music released ever).   This album is mediocre at best. I've told many people this: DEATH MAGNETIC AINT GOT NOTHING ON UNITED ABOMINATIONS!

B0006A9FKA|5.0|I ordered this because I had been looking around to purchase and couldn't find it in a retail store anywhere.  I received it in just a couple of days and it was in perfect condition.  The film is GREAT and I highly reccommend it to others if you like British dark humor.
B0007TKNIS|5.0|Wonderful, there should be so much true love in the world. Enspiring and full of hope that someone is out there for everyone. I think it is the most wonderful movie of all time!!!
B00005JPUN|1.0|Somebody has to warn Nicole Kidman to leave classics like this and the very similarly disappointing The Stepford Wives alone. This, the third remake of the 1956 classic (also redone correctly the first time in 1978), is quite frankly all bark and no bite. Gone are the classic pods from another world simply replaced with a virus that makes you all cheesy while you sleep to awaken new, refreshed, and emotionless. At least with the first two films the possessed/aliens got angry from time to time, but in this the group plays the unphased to the point of boredom. At least they tried to make the film different with instead of a young couple running switching it to mostly a mother and her child (who is conveniently immune), but the chase is typical cat and mouse and the ending has to be one of the most upbeat & weakest ones I've seen in quite awhile. Watched off of cable (where it belongs), spend your next money to burn on the excellent 1978 version instead.<br />(RedSabbath Rating:5.5/10)
B000X5SPBI|5.0|I Am from New Zealand and i just read the download Instructions for the digital Copy and i found out that you need to be in united states to download i am going to try it but i don't hold much luck. plus my case was broken in Transit. still we are waiting for Supernatural season 2 to be shown in new zealand so i been getting supernatural seasons from amazon for 2 years now. i can't wait for season 3 i have only found out odds and ends from some episodes plus i know the how season 3 ends still there are some episodes i don't know nothing about so i cannot wait to sit down and watch Season 3.
B00030590I|5.0|As I read the others reviews - very accurated - and do not dare to say more about this \\" another-masterpiece \\" from the master Zhang Yimou.<br />I will just say that I saw it at the movie. That I had one copy, that some friend borrowed and I could not ' not-have ' - one copy to review and review.<br />No. I am using this chance to say that thanks to the cybernetics I can buy from the most serious and correct seller of this planet: I bought the dvd  with an estimated delivery time of october 1st - and received it today, sept 18th !!!  Perfect! Brand new! Hot! Crisp! That's Amazon !
B001DHXT2A|2.0|I won't be purchasing ths DVD until they release it as an extended cut.  The theatrical release felt as though 45 minutes of plot was missing!<br /><br />They just moved from Hulk Smash scene to Hulk Smash scene and didn't give time for any the characters to develop into anything the audience could care about. Basically the producers provided the complete opposite of the 2003 film, when they should have just looked for a happy medium.<br /><br />Hopefully Marvel Studios will give the fans a more complete version someday, possibly Ed Norton's original cut, just like they did with Daredevil-presenting a movie that is actually watchable.

B00009P1O0|5.0|I just recently bought this on CD. I really never got into this one back when it came out as an LP. I had always been into Neil, but after a while I guess I just burnt out on him and it was about when this one appeared. Bottom line is I have re-visited Neil on many occasions and have periods where I want to hear him all the time and then I get out of the mood for a while but I always return. On The Beach is one that I never heard and as I read other reviews I became intrigued. I have not been disappointed! This CD is full of everything that is Neil Young. The guitarwork is typical Neil in that it is simple and yet hauntingly effective as a framework for what I feel have got to be some of his best lyrics and singing. A lot of the reviews refer to this as a \\"dark\\" Neil Young album and there is no denying the truth of that analysis. It doesnt get any more serious, or relevant to todays society than \\"Revolution Blues\\" where as an outcast living on the edge of society talks of murdering Hollywood stars in their cars. However, the unique dark Neil Young humor, wit and sarcasam abounds in cuts like my personal favorite \\"Ambulance Blues\\" where he spouts that \\"Mother Goose is on the skids and the shoe aint happy and neither are the kids\\". Only Neil could come up with this kind of stuff and use it in a serious manner. Walk On, For the Turnstiles, and On The Beach are also standout cuts that are as good as anything he has ever written. In my opinion it is one of the most consistant of all the Neil Young offerings. In short, I love this one and recommend it to anyone who likes Neil.
B00007G1ZM|5.0|This film is a gem from the Hollywood era. Joan Crawford delivers a terrific performance as Mildred Pierce, a middle-aged women desperately trying to provide for her daughters as her marriage collapses. Told mostly in flashbacks, the film opens with a man being shot in a fancy Southern California beach house. The police pick-up Mildred and start questioning her, since it's her 2nd husband who is dead. Mildred recounts the ups and downs or her life and her inexplicable drive to win-over the love of her children, especially her spoiled, demanding eldest daughter named Veda.<br /><br />The acting in Mildred Pierce is incredible. Crawford hits all the right  notes as the workaholic mother with poor taste in men but a golden touch for running a business. She's almost overshadowed by Ann Blyth as the pampered, obnoxious teenage daughter Veda. Zachary Scott as Mildred's playboy second husband and a wisecracking Eve Arden add a lot of color to the cast. Combine great acting with a cracking plot and you'll find that Mildred Pierce is a must-have DVD if you like movies from the 1940-50s.
B00192KCQ0|1.0|I love Death Magnetic. I won't waste my words on praising it - many of the others have done it. It's new and fresh - there are some great ideas and dynamics in there, and I am not getting bored with it.    However, my ears are going to explode at some point. The sound quality is simply bad, and frankly, embarrassing. As some others have experienced, when I played it in my car on a bad stereo and with all the background noise, I did not even notice. When I played it using my headphones, dear lord, all the crackling was a bit too much. How did this get out?    I played it back-to-back with Porcupine Tree's Fear of the Blank Planet, and boy, what a difference in production. If the Metallica boys haven't heard of the frontman/producer/composer/multi-instrumentalist Steven Wilson, they might consider getting his services to re-master and save this album (although it would appear that an amateur can do a better job).     I normally wouldn't rate this album a 1 (it's really a 4 or a 5), but I am joining the \\"protest\\" vote in order to see if something can be done about this.
B00192KCQ0|4.0|Yes this is the Metallica I know and love.  Lars finally found his other kick drum, Kirk solos, James is growling.  Great album and back to form.
1577312082|5.0|No matter if you're religious, spiritual, or neither, Tolle's gift to the world is this book and it should be read before one dies (sooner rather than later, if you really want to improve your life).  Westerners are especially poor at living in the now...we have no examples or teachers of this in Western society -- or few, at best.  Until one discovers how to live in the moment (this will take much practice and re-reading or re-listening to Tolle), life is either anxiety- or depression-ridden, or we are all trying to escape from our underlying fears.  The only escape from this is to concentrate on the present.  I recommend this to everyone.  When the student is ready, the teacher appears and Tolle is an excellent guide in this regard.  This book changed my life.  I now experience more joy and less worry.  If you want to be more fulfilled, read this book (or listen to the cd).
B001AIRUOU|5.0|With all due respect to those little teenagers wandering around wearing \\"Nightmare\\" gear from Hot Topic despite having no clue to what the movie is, I am one of those people that saw this back in its original debut clear the hell back in elementary school.<br /><br />And the movie still charms me to no end.  I just cannot get over the sheer sweetness of a story of Halloween horrors (who are still very nice people) wanting to share in the magic of Christmas--despite the fact that they are simply made for Halloween. It's simple, but charming and beautifully done with a message that speaks to adults as well as children. This actually may be one of the more perfect family films out there.<br /><br />This edition I adore, from the awesome casing to all the bonus features that will certainly satisfy all geekdom.  This is exactly how this film gem should be released.
B00158K0S8|5.0|I personally love this movie. My first purchase of this movie was in Betamax and I still love it. I was amazed at the difference in quality with the Blu-ray version. The colors and detail are fantastic. The sound is better, but not as good as you will get from a new action movie. I am very pleased to have this new release and strongly recommend it to any lovers of the movie.
0812977203|5.0|Actually, this isn't Agatha Christy's best, but I give it a five star rating for its importance as her first mystery and the first Hercule Poirot story.  All others came from this one and it is a first rate puzzler.  Those already familiar with Agatha Christy will have it partially figured out if mot completely long before the end, but this shows the influence she had on the development of the mystery genre.  She plays a game with the reader and she plays it fair and square.  While doing so, she creates one of fiction's most memorably eccentric characters, Hercule Poirot.  He is such an enjoyable character that the book is captivating observing him although the suspects in this one aren't particularly likeable.  This is a pure puzzle and doesn't have the sense of tragedy that some of her later books have.  It's a fast read and definitely an enjoyable one.
031606792X|5.0|This is for everyone who rated Breaking Dawn with one star.  Your complaints are with where she took HER story?  Rate a book on the quality of the writing; otherwise, your comments are without merit.  You might as well tell us how country music is better than rock music...or vice versa.    This was my favorite book of the series.  Jacob imprinting on Nessie was my high point of the series.  Am I wrong for thinking this?  No.  Am I right for feeling this?  No. But it is right for me and everyone else who agrees.    For a criticism with the writing - keeping in mind that I can only dream of writing as well - \\"muttered\\" was used too much.  There was a lot of muttering. :)
B000NA77YO|5.0|Let me start by saying this isn't likely to convert any Ozzy die hards over to the Dio camp.<br />To me the Ozzy and Dio years were entirely differant eras for Sabbath, and yes the Dio years don't sound like Sabbath.<br />This is the Sabbath band playing Dios songs.<br />If you like that, and I love BOTH versions of Sabbath for what they bring.<br />Well, you'll like this.<br />The song selection is mostly very good.<br />If you know the original albums, most of what you are looking for will be found here.<br />If you are looking for a one shot disc to sum up the Dio years, well you've got it here!<br />Nice packaging too...
B0001AVZA8|4.0|To quote John Mellencamp, this \\"little ditty `bout Jack and Diane\\" called \\"Something's Gotta Give\\" is somewhat of a sleeper comedy nowadays but still managed to give Diane Keaton a Golden Globe for Best Actress (as well as an Academy Award nomination) in 2004.  Co-star Jack Nicholson was nominated for a Golden Globe as well for his performance and these are two of the best reasons to watch the film.<br /><br />Keaton is Erica Barry, a divorcee and accomplished playwright who decides to spend some time at her beach house in the summer with her sister Zoe (McDormand).  When she arrives, she is shocked to find a man digging around in her fridge, clothed only in his oxford shirt, boxers and dress socks.  With Erica threatening to phone the police, the man quickly introduces himself as Harry Sanborn (Nicholson) and explains that he is there with her daughter Marin (Peete) for the weekend.  Embarrassed that he has been caught in his skivvies, he insists that he will leave but Zoe pipes in, suggesting that all four of them spend some quality time.  This is where the fun begins.<br /><br />Over dinner that evening, Erica quickly learns that Harry is a chauvinistic playboy, Marin another notch on the belt of his quest to desperately cling to his youth.  Harry senses Erica's disdain not only for his capricious behavior but also her disapproval of his relationship with Marin and reciprocates the hostility, quite certain that they will not get along no matter what happens.  What neither of them bank on is keeping up the venomous front for several weeks while Harry recovers from a heart attack he suffers that night.<br /><br />At the urging of his doctor Julian Mercer (Reeves), Harry recuperates close to the hospital, Erica reluctantly providing hospice.  Born out of what is at first an irksome period is a surprising camaraderie and eventual love affair, one that turns Erica's world upside down.  Aside from her exhilarating dalliances with Harry, she is simultaneously squired by the handsome Julian, a man nearly half her age.  Erica's once ho-hum life is thrown into an emotional upheaval, her heart quickly set aflame and just as quickly extinguished by the wayward Harry.  Not one to let a broken heart disrupt her life completely, she uses her romantic foibles as the primary tool for penning another successful play, one which more or less tells the entire story of her brief romance.<br /><br />Screenwriter and director Nancy Meyers wrote the parts of Erica and Harry with Diane Keaton and Jack Nicholson specifically in mind to play them and they are smart casting choices indeed.  The best pairing since Nicholson himself and Shirley MacLaine in 1983's \\"Terms of Endearment\\", Erica and Harry are that couple least likely to succeed but when they fall for one another they fall harder than one would care to predict, despite their vastly different personalities and ideals.  Keaton prevails with the comedic timing she possesses in spades whilst Nicholson is the wry and strangely sexy older man that he's so fond of playing.  Reeves, normally armed with the dramatic prowess of knotty pine, is surprisingly looser and warmer here, the most natural and enjoyable performance I've ever seen; for such a minor role, it's without a doubt his best so far.<br /><br />Bottom line: It's obvious at first glance what the film's strong suits are (screenplay and lead actors) and both are in top form here.  You'd be hard-pressed to find a reason not to see two film veterans at the top of their game in one of the better romantic comedies of 2003., a man nearly half her age.

B001FEA9QU|5.0|This review is to vouch for the sound quality of the downloaded MP3s. I've listened to the album many times over the last week, and I can definitely say that it sounds like CD quality.     Definitely a great album!
B000YAA68C|5.0|Went to see this movie in the theater with my husband and eighteen year old son.  Amazing when all three of us like the same movie.  Definitely a romantic comedy, but had enough good music and humor to keep even the 18 year old's interest.  Probably helped that he was heading to Ireland a few months after this.  I strongly recommend this movie.  It's the type you can watch over and over and the music is great.  If I remeber correctly, the soundtrack doesn't include my favorite songs from the wake and the Irish pub scenes. Would love to find a cd with those on it.
B000005RFQ|2.0|Like all Black Sabbath and Uriah Heep remasters released by Castle between 1996 and 1998, this 1983 masterpiece featured a sticker on the front which stated \\"faithfully restored artwork\\". Unfortunately, the cover artwork on these releases was in most cases very badly reproduced, with grainy printing and wrong colors. In \\"Born Again\\", the purpleish background was printed as a far lighter shade of blue, completely different to the original LP artwork. I've always considered the cover artwork as much a part of an album as its musical content, so I can only rate this release as an unacceptable insult to the band and their fans.
0670020745|4.0|This book gave me an inside view of what its like to have a stroke and how to treat a person that has had a stroke.
0066620996|3.0|After many years of ignoring the hype about this book (it admittedly has a great name) I buckled and read it.  It was o.k.  I did find some useful facts and anecdotes in it but for the most part it reminded me of esoteric research papers that I was forced to read in med school and residency -- crammed with #'s and statistics and graphs, but relatively little in the way of real-life applicable insights.  Worth a quick perusal.  The books by Trout and Ries are much better.
B0019OP0GU|5.0|I bought this movie hoping to like it because of Emma Watson being in it. She is a great actress and this movie was wonderful with her in it. My daughter who is almost 4 didn't understand some of it, but she still enjoyed watching it with me. It is a movie we will enjoy over and over again!
B000P0J09W|4.0|It's a good movie, it's somewhat ridiculous, but that is sort of the point.  You have Andie the cheerleader, Martha the smart quirky friend, Data the 007 wanna be, mouth the outspoken pain in the butt friend, chunk the non adventurer, Mikey the asthmatic dreamer, and Brandon the elder brother go in search of treasure in order to save their homes and their town.<br /><br />Ann Ramsey is brilliant as Mama.  There are great lines in this movie, and despite its quirks it is a lot of fun to watch and later quote. (\\"Babyyy-Ruuuth\\", Booty Traps, Hit Puree, You Goonie, Goonies never say die)
0439023483|5.0|Survivor meets American Idol.  The Miss America Pageant meets Ultimate Fighting Championship.  The Olympics meets Shirley Jackson's \\"The Lottery.\\"  Before \\"Hunger Games,\\" I thought Lois Lowry's \\"The Giver\\" and Nancy Farmer's \\"House of Scorpions\\" were among the best of the genre, but Collins' new book takes young adult science fiction to a whole new level.  It is a riveting, almost too intense read.  Not for the faint of heart.

0385504209|1.0|This is one of the stupidist books I have ever come across.  I have no idea why people raved about it.  It has nothing to do with true Christianity or what Jesus is all about.  I am a Christian and I consider it blasphemous--to suggest that Jesus had a wife and link his purity to such practices of cult sex is nauseating.  This book has nothing to do with what true Christianity is all about--it's not about symbols and dark secrets.  It's about light and hope and a love that cannot be manipulated.  I don't think Dan Brown really understands Christianity.  There are many better ways to spend the precious moments of your life than to waste it on this book.
031606792X|1.0|There is nothing I can say that has not been said already, but save your cash and skip over Breaking Dawn. Stephenie Meyer clearly had no idea how to wrap up her series, ending the book on a sickly sweet note. What is she trying to tell her younger readers, that all they need to be happy is to marry young, skip receiving an education, pop out children as quickly as possible, and rely solely on their husbands? Breaking Dawn has tainted my feelings for the three other books in the series, and makes me hope that she won't write a sequel to The Host. We all know how that would turn out, now don't we?
0345409671|5.0|The Vampire Lestat is at it again and now, back from his romp in a human body, the Devil himself is after him. (****Spoilers****) Upon stalking and finally killing a drug baron in the shadow of St. Patrick's, Lestat is visited by his ghost, who tells him a tale of human morality and a heretical sect of the church only to be interrupted by The Devil Memnoch himself. As Dante was led through Hell into Heaven, Lestat is lead by the Devil (who prefers the name Memnoch by the way) from Heaven and the tale of earth's creation and his own, perhaps inevitable, fall, and into the depths of hell itself in his quest to make Lestat his Lt. What Lestat decides will change the course of humanity and vampires forever.<br /><br />Once again, Rice offers an intense, highly thought-out philosophical and quasi-religious book. Fans of Interview with the Vampire, The Vampire Lestat, and even Tale of the Body Thief will enjoy volume 5 immensely. Those who preferred Queen of the Damned, I must say you're out of luck again... But never fear, another child of the millennia tells the story of his live and afterlife with David Talbot's help: The Vampire Armand.
B00192KCQ0|4.0|This album is really growing on me. Passionate, committed, musically adventurous...what we want from Metallica. Kirk's solos are a cause for celebration and a challenge to today's axemen. I actually like the production. It's detailed without being fussy and full of gleaming sonic impact. Withholding further judgement on the sound - haven't heard the other mix but understand it's causing a ruckus...

B0000DETET|5.0|This is the sort of music that made parents hate heavy metal, even though bands like Black Sabbath got more press because of it. Of course, that's because a lot of people had never heard of Venom. I was listening to Slayer and Morbid Angel long before I ever owned a Black Sabbath album, so by the time I attempted to listen to Sabbath's quasi-dark image coupled with Ozzy's whining for God to help him it just appalled me; it seemed like the whole band and their image was a sham. I couldn't understand why anyone liked them. I still can't stand Ozzy's voice, and if it weren't for sort of fun songs like \\"Sweet Leaf,\\" I wouldn't have taken the time to try to listen to Sabbath at all. On the other hand, despite cheesy, tongue in cheek lyrics, Venom felt like the real deal. Having been aware of their influence on thrash without actually having heard them, as a teenager I hunted down copies of Welcome to Hell and Black Metal.<br /><br />These appalled me for a different reason but ended up growing on me. The really appalling thing was the production quality. You could barely make out what the instruments were doing. It took repeated listenings before it even began to sound like something resembling music. Even then, it was apparent that this wasn't the most tight or technically-proficient band. It was clear that they weren't popular enough to do an album with great sound quality. Their appearance was also totally silly and gimmicky-looking. These are all legitimate reasons to dislike them, but on the other hand, they had a certain charm. They were certainly more appealing to me as a teenager than Black Sabbath. They had more of a garage band sound, and with the pentagram on the cover and lyrics about Satan, this was the sort of album you had to hide or your parents might throw it away and start inviting priests over to dinner. I hid my copy behind a rack of magazines in my bedroom. And that's all part of what made it fun; unlike Black Sabbath, this actually seemed subversive. Black Sabbath had occult imagery; Venom was the sort of band you'd expect to see playing at a drunken party in the pits of hell. It was pure blasphemous fun; and made no apologies for its silliness and blasphemy. And unlike Diamond Head, who also had songs with \\"Evil\\" in the title, they actually sounded evil.<br /><br />Despite admittedly shoddy musicianship and production, the attitude of the songs on this is what makes it really stand out. So what if Cronos can't sing and none of them can play their instruments well; they got the job done. For the time, this was crushingly heavy-sounding stuff. Sure, it doesn't seem as crushingly heavy today, but the crushingly heavy bands of today wouldn't have been properly inspired if it weren't for Venom. And I suppose that's the argument for why this is a great and historically important album.<br /><br />My copy has been sitting in my parents' attic for umpteen years, and after rediscovering it, it still retains all the charm it had when I first listened to it. This is fun stuff. \\"In League with Satan\\" is one of the best songs ever, very catchy, but in general so are all the songs on here. \\"1000 days in Sodom\\" is another favorite of mine. Great chorus, and the bass is very groovy. It's like pure evil with a side of cheese. The horrible demo-like quality just adds to the atmosphere of it all. A piece of music history. This is what it's all about.Sabbath had occult imagery; Venom was the sort of band you'd expect to see playing at a drunken party in the pits of hell.

B00102F5WK|5.0|This 2007 film is scary.  That's because the theme is about the practice of interrogating suspected terrorists in a foreign country where laws against torture do not apply.  This practice is called rendition and  this film makes it real.  It's hard to watch.<br /><br />The film opens in an American middle class suburb.  Reese Witherspoon is playing with her small son when they get a phone call from her husband, Omar Metwally, an Egyptian citizen who has lived in America for 20 years.  He tells his wife and son he is on the way home from a business trip and they plan on meeting him at the airport.  All seems well.<br /><br />When he gets off the plane, however, he is detained at the airport and questioned.  He is a chemical engineer and the questioners are asking questions about a terrorist bomb plot.  He denies everything.  He seems clean but Meryl Streep, playing a high powered Washington decision maker, orders him to be put into rendition and he is whisked away to an unnamed middle eastern country and his name erased from the plane's passenger log while his wife and son wait patiently at the airport for a husband and father who has disappeared.<br /><br />The scene now shifts to an unnamed middle eastern country where Yagal Noor, an Israeli actor of Jewish Iraqi descent, is cast in the role of the interrogator.  Jake Gyllenhaal is cast as an American diplomat, who has just lost a co-worker in a suicide bombing, and has been promoted to assist Yagal Noor with the questioning.  It is awful.  I am cringing now just writing about it as scenes of waterboarding and electric shock torture are shown in detail.  There is also a subplot about the interrogator's daughter and a suicide bomber which expands the story.<br /><br />In the meantime Reese Witherspoon is trying desperately to find her husband.  She seeks out an old boyfriend, played by Peter Sarsgaard who works for a senator, played by Alan Arkin.  Even when they confront Meryl Streep, there is a blank wall of silence.

0439023483|5.0|For starters, I love dystopian science fiction stories.  I'm a big fan of novels like [[ASIN:0765318857 Make Room! Make Room!]] (a.k.a. [[ASIN:B0016I0AJG Soylent Green]]) and the writings of Philip K. Dick.  In that sense, I knew I was going to like The Hunger Games from the get go.<br /><br />The premise: America has been ravaged by war and the remaining survivors are clustered into twelve districts.  Life is hard in (most of) the districts, and if you're lucky you might earn enough through the year to be feed your family. Each year, two teenagers from each district are conscripted into a televised death match where the winner walks away with a lifetime of food and shelter provided by the central government.<br /><br />The writing is simple, overly so at times.  Ms. Collins feels the need to explain how things got to be the way they are instead of leaving it up to the reader to surmise.  Then again, it's marketed as a \\"teen\\" novel, so perhaps the level of detail is necessary for its target audience.<br /><br />There is a fair amount of violence in the novel, although nothing you wouldn't find in a PG-13 movie.  I appreciated the fact that there's no course language, which is something that many \\"adult\\" novels could take a cue from.<br /><br />The pacing of the novel is just right, with the occasional twist presented at the right moment.  One exception was where the Gamemakers announce a change in the rules during the game; it was too predictable, and I had to set the book down in disgust for a few hours.  In general, though, I read the book every chance I could get.  I would wake up early just so I could get an extra chapter in.<br /><br />At 374 pages the book is long enough to present a well-rounded tale.  If anything, I would have enjoyed a longer book, and the teaser at the end alludes that another book is in the works.  I'm intrigued enough to look for the next book in the series when it comes out.
B000BPFBVW|1.0|I am a big Ray Charles fan but this disc is terrible. Ray doesnt sound like himself, just a bad old voice trying to get the magic back, unsuccessfully. He was off key and failed to reach the higher octaves. The mixing of the music and solos is also quite poor. I listened to the first song and started searching FF for a better song,it wasn't on this disc. So sad but true. Monster Music did Ray an injustice by making this disc. They should have used tapes from his younger superstar recordings and overlayed them on this disc. Jamie Fox would have sounded better. I was so looking forward to this superdisc but stuff happens. Don't buy it or you'll be sorry. P.S. Johnny Mathis did sound good.
B0014KD46W|4.0|Not since his collaborations with Remi Kabaka and Abdul Lasisi Amao (Aiye-Keta, 1973) has Winwood explored African rhythms and style in such depth as on this recording. A perplexing album if one is looking for vintage Winwood pop or even latter-day Traffic (although elements of both survive and even thrive on this recording). Overall, Winwood's vocal abilities still amaze, his lyrical sensibility is always interesting, and the musicianship on this record surpasses anything by ANY new band pretenders out there. He is an ORIGINAL, and that - is THAT. The heavy reliance on percussion is curious, but Winwood still manages to pull off a better record at this stage of his career than practically any of his younger wannabes.
B000001GBJ|4.0|I have listened this musician several times. Then i decided to have this album. In my opinion, these songs have their own pleasure completely. So this is an effective experince to listen them.
B00192KCQ0|4.0|When you are as big as Metallica,scaled every musical everest there is, poured your heart our for everyone to see what else is there left to do. First you enlist the master knob-twiddler Dr. Rick Rubin. The Metallica sound is as instantly recognizable as the Stones or Zep, you can only do so much with it. This record sounds like a lot of there others,it just sounds great.Metallica are not about saving your life or ending global warming. This is a hello to everyone out there who cares to listen,what they do they do very well and after nearly thirty years not many can touch them musically.
B000F9RB8A|5.0|This movie is fantastic. I could watch it once a week... maybe even more. The visuals, the story line (if you're a kung-fu enthusiast) the characters... everything is so fun.
B00192KCQ0|5.0|Most of the tracks sound like the were inspired by Slayer's Reign in Blood album. And it's about damn time! Even Slayer abandoned their visionary song composition after Reign in Blood. I bought that Slayer album as a kid and was amazed by all the surprising changes in direction and head-banging grooves and thought surely this was the beginning of a musical revolution. Sadly, music only got dumber after that with grunge and alternative leading the way. Even the metal bands fell limp and to this day sound more like a punk album played at a faster tempo. Death Magnetic steps above the rest. Hopefully it will reignite the composition revolution that should have taken place 20 freaking years ago. But realistically, it appears that most people hate this element, want something they can fall asleep to, and this will become merely a point of contention among fans. Congrats, Metallica! You guys got balls!
B000000OQF|5.0|In a few more years, this may be a legitimate debate, as GNR becomes eligible for the RnR Hall of Fame. And though the band put out about four more albums (Lies, Use Your Illusion I and II, Spaghetti Incident), this is the definitive piece of work for this band. And with good reason! Unlike most of the other \\"Hair Metal\\" bands that were more about glitz (a certain New Jersey pretty boy comes to mind), this band was simply supersonic, nitty gritty, raw rock! Twenty years later, and this album is just as hard hitting! I first saw them open for Motley Crue on the Girls, Girls, Girls tour in 1987 (thanks to Google, I found the actual date!) ... we had camped out (back in the days when you could do that!) for Crue tix, and had never heard of GNR; I remember wondering WTF 'cause Aerosmith had been opening for Crue on an earlier leg of the tour. Then we went to the show, and it was definitely WTF ... as in, OMG, who the HELL are these guys, they ROCK!! Slash was on stage trashed, carrying a bottle of Beam. To this day, I still remember them performing most of these songs, particularly \\"Mr. Brownstone\\" and \\"Paradise City\\", which was simply incredible. Also, they did their \\"Knockin' on Heaven's Door\\" cover. After the 45 minute we were already exhausted. My best friend went to the store the next week and bought the tape; he couldn't stop talking about them    Over the course of the next few years, as the band blew up big time, I remember telling people about that show. I think it still stands as my favorite to this day, with maybe Pink Floyd competing! But this was sheer decadence, and it felt GOOD!!!    It is shame that this band imploded, since this could have been truly legendary band along the lines of The Who, Zeppelin, etc. Then again, what made them great is what destroyed them (alcohol, coke, smack), although the aforementioned bands somehow survived, at least for a while. Alas, I digress ... this album is one of the all-time greats of rock; the balance between Slash's lead and Issy's rhythm is superb, Duff (bass) and Steve Adler (drums) created a pounding rhythm section that is comparable to Jones and Bonham. And so much has been said about Axl, but what truly amazes me is that he has the scratchy, shrieking voice, but is able to sing in three octaves with ease. And even on this first major label release effort, the production is stupendous, with Axl providing his own backing vocals in different octaves, which is probably the signature part of the sound! Check out \\"It's So Easy\\", especially the bridge and, of course, \\"Paradise City\\". It all made for incredible melodies and harmonies at a sonic decibel level.    All in all, this was no \\"hair band\\"; this band was as loud and raw as it got. As the last salvo to the '80s, they provided a terrific bookend with Brian Jone's incarnation of AC/DC for the decade that came in loud and went out loud, even if there was a lot of mush in between! Even as the band was collapsing of its own stature, grunge was on the rise (ironically, Nirvana would repeat this brief but iconic story arc with an even more tragic ending). When the time comes in a few more years, I hope this band is given its due!
0316168815|5.0|I was given this book by a friend to read not long after it was released and because of certain events in my life it was a very difficult read to say the least. It took me over a month to finish it, but once I did I told my friend she wasn't getting it back.  It was passed around a group of friends and family and everyone had their chance to read it.  I appreciate Alice Sebold attempting to write a book with such a difficult story and doing an wonderful job in the process.
B001CZJKS0|1.0|I have the 20th and 25th anniversary of Halloween, and both are valid and worth having. Besides the film, they each have different special features that are \\"totally\\" informative about the making of this classic. This new release sounds like a big waste of time and money. I've never been a fan of Halloween 4-9 so that's certainly no incentive to buy this. Especially when you consider it's missing 2 and 3. For the 30th anniversary this should have been a blowout dvd with tons of new info attached.  Do yourself a favor and get either the 20th or 25th on eBay. Screw Anchor Bay
0385340990|5.0|It's very rare, but every so often a book appears that makes you remember why it is that you love reading so much.  This is one of those books.  You must read this book.<br /><br />Told in epistolary form, it centers on one Juliet Ashton, a columnist and new author living in post-WWII London.  Through a charming series of events, Juliet meets the residents of Guernsey, an English island located in the Channel that was occupied by the Germans in the war.  The novel becomes their story just as much as Juliet's story.<br /><br />The storyline, in the hands of less-capable authors, might have been average at best.  But Mary Ann Shaffer and her niece Annie Barrows have turned a basic story into a masterpiece by invoking humor, charm, good-manners, irony, tragedy, tears and laughter.<br /><br />This is the kind of book that will make you want to buy several copies and give them to people you care about.<br /><br />Don't miss out.
B000002P5W|5.0|Jimi Hendrix just barely finished The Jimi Hendrix Experience's debut album, \\"Are You Experienced\\", when they started work on the sonic sounding psychedelic rock album, \\"Axis: Bold As Love\\". Taking a much more out there sounding album than Are You Experienced, this album stays true too the bands original sound but using more cooler sounds. Realesed around the same time Cream's second album, \\"Disraeli Gears\\", came out Axis: Bold As Love is much more experimental. Its a really great album you can listen too it five times over and over again and not get tired of it. Its just one of those albums. Axis: Bold As Love starts off with the alien song EXP, in which the interviewer(Mitch Mitchell), interviews an expert on aliens(Jimi Hendrix) during the interview aliens come and theres tons of these weird guitar feedback noises but than it stops and goes into the jazzy goodness of the albums second track, \\"Up From The Skies\\", showing how Mitch Mitchell has a talent for drums using drum brushes for that cool sounding beat, while Jimi Hendrix is making these cool wah wah effects and singing. Good song but than goes into the rocker, \\"Spanish Castle Magic\\", which is one of the only songs they ever played live off this album. A cool beat and is a classic hendrix song, than it goes into the sonic sounding, \\"Wait Until Tommorow\\", which has some elements of jazz in it but mainly its a psychedelic song and has a cool drum beat and riff too it and than it stops and goes into the short rocker, \\"Aint No Telling\\", which has a really cool riff and beat but only lasts for 2 minutes and than goes into the slow rocker, \\"Little Wing\\". which has very cool guitar in it and is another classic among hendrix fans. Than it goes into the psychedelic rocker, \\"If 6 Was 9\\", which has a good beat and riff the whole time and has cool lyrics and lasts for about 5 minutes than we go into the eighth track, \\"You Got Me Floatin'\\", pretty good song i dont know not one of my faviortes but than into the cool 9th track, \\"Castles Made Of Sand\\", which has a nice beat too it and than goes into the tenth track, \\"She's So Fine\\", which is one of the first Jimi Hendrix tracks too feature Noel Redding on vocals, its a cool psychedelic rock song and a cool riff. The eleventh track, \\"One Rainy Wish\\", is one of those cool slow Jimi Hendrix songs that has a nice psychedelic rock too it, than the 12th track, \\"Little Miss Lover\\", is a fast paced song with a cool drum beat and a hard riff but only lasts a little more than 2 minutes and than gets into the magestic last track, \\"Bold As Love\\", which i personally think is the best song on the whole album. Great Great song with the coolest beat ever and one of the best acid rock songs around. Than it slowly fades out and like that the albums over. Look if you read this review what are you waiting for go out and buy this album today cause you cant live with out itrack, \\"Castles Made Of Sand\\", which has a nice beat too it and than goes into the tenth track, \\"She's So Fine\\", which is one of the first Jimi Hendrix tracks too feature Noel Redding on vocals, its a cool psychedelic rock song and a cool riff.

B00001IVOF|5.0|To me, Mobb Deep's appeal has always been the ice cold flow of Prodigy.      Although there were alot of lyricists on the east coast at this time who covered similar subject matter (Smif n Wesson, Black Moon, Wu-Tang etc) none of the emcees ever sounded as smooth and calm as prodigy did when he spun his crime narratives.    Prodigy was also extremely descriptive in his stories which made his best work have an ominous, almost horror movie feel.  It is great stuff, some of the best lyrics ever written.    In 1996, Prodigy was at the height of his skills.  This is my favorite Mobb Deep Album because Prodigy's lyrics are classic on every single cut.    Nighttime Vulture's is one of the great rap songs ever.  It's beat was used heavily by other emcees on mixtapes to freestyle over around that time.    The rest of this album is on that level.    Definately a classic.

B000002UHG|5.0|\\"Broken China\\" came out in 1996, on the heels of Pink Floyd's \\"P*U*L*S*E*,\\" and just like listening to any solo effort by any of the others, one can hear the ingredients he contributed to the Pink Floyd juggernaut. And here, he had help from fellow post-Waters Floyd bandmates Tim Renwick and Anthony Moore. Renwick played guitar behind Gilmour and Moore contributed to the writing as well.<br /><br />On September 18th, I read about the September 15th death of Wright, and as usual, news like this jarred me. It's odd, some people you have never met, people like Wright, become a part of your life, and when they're gone, there is an emptiness where they once were. So I got out all my Pink Floyd recordings and had my own little mourning session. I knew he wasn't against the occaisional toot of cocaine, and at 65 years old, he wasn't a spring chicken any more, but surprising was the news that is was cancer that took him; I didn't even know he was ill. But, he obviously treated it as a private matter, and I am sure he left with dignity.<br /><br />As I type this, I am listening to \\"Broken China,\\" and even though his vocals aren't this disc's high point, he did sing with soul. Giving some of the vocals to Sinead O'Connor was, I feel, a wise move; like her or not, her voice and delivery are a very good vehicle for this material. It wouldn't have hurt to feature her more, but everything here, as presented, works nicely. Most of this disc is instrumental, and where Wright didn't write any lyrics, the music is all his, a multilayered orchestration, if you will, banks upon banks of textures giving the mind a real show. If you can think with the right side of the brain, as most fans of this type of music seem to be able to do, the imagination will take you places not often seen.<br /><br />\\"Breaking Water\\" opens things up, a little fanfare which sets things in motion, cutting into \\"Night Of A Thousand Furry Toys,\\" the first number about escaping. There is a theme about depression running throughout, and having sixteen selections, it would be tedious to write, and read, about all of them in an on-line review; the reader will be spared.<br /><br />But, despite the gloomy nature of \\"Broken China,\\" it is an impressive piece of music, and even though the majority if it is played on keyboard instruments, they are arranged in a way where I can easily picture an eighty-piece orchestra performing it, not unlike Alan Parsons' \\"Tales Of Mystery And Imagination.\\" Every time I listen to it, I hear something I didn't hear before, even if it's just some little percussion part, a harmony in the vocals, or a previously unheard cello.<br /><br />Richard William Wright, 1943-2008, was a master of minimalist technique on his chosen instrument, making less sound like more, being a classicaly trained cellist, a jazz piano student, playing rhythm guitar in the very first line-up of the band that would one day morph into Pink Floyd, wisely changing over to piano and organ, then mellotron, and later, all the little goodies the twentieth and twenty-first century had to offer, he is probably the most imitated keyboard player in contemporary music, yet lived a life of quiet dignity, and first-rate progressive, often heavy music.<br /><br />Break out your old Floyd records, if you have them, and remember him; he deserves it.having sixteen selections, it would be tedious to write, and read, about all of them in an on-line review; the reader will be spared.

0307346617|5.0|I was skeptical about reading a book that included zombies, but I gave it a go when my scifi book club chose it for September, and I'm so glad I did.  Brooks did such an amazing job using this interview/documentary style.  The prose is intelligent and almost scholarly, yet fresh and very personal.  He also masterfully weaves elements of the story arc throughout various first person accounts from different viewpoints.      What I think I really enjoyed about this book was its depth -not only in character development, but in the human response to the zombie crisis.  A lot of movies and books around the subject never really get past the superficial or first response.      I still don't think a zombie apocalypse is possible, but while reading the book it all made sense.
B00006GO9Q|5.0|Most musicians go their entire careers without ever coming up with one truly original idea.    Miles Davis was the opposite, a man who never allowed himself, or his music, to get too comfortable, to get stagnant.    Sometimes the new directions he went were exciting and enjoyable to listen to, sometimes they weren't but he always pushed  the envelope.    This beautiful album stands as one of the great triumphs of his life.      This is music that is as complex as any that he ever created but still is accessible and pleasing to the ear.  As a result, it is music that you can listen to in any situation and enjoy.    It rewards close listening, repeated listenings yet still can function as very enjoyable background music for reading, drawing, studying etc.    The first thing you will notice about this album is the very pleasing sound of the rhythm sections comprised of Three Keyboardists, Guitar and Tony Williams fine cymbal work.      These new sounds, unlike any other in jazz up to that point, creates a dreamy, surreal soundscape which draws you in and over which the soloists can create their beautiful statements.    The two tracks both do a great job of building tension and mood.  My favorite part of the album is during the track It's About That Time in which a two bar bass line groove is used to build energy throughout the guitar and soprano sax solos until Miles solo where the drummer Tony Williams goes completely nuts for a few measures.  After the chill out groove of the prior music it really is a satisfying and beautiful moment.    This music is some of the most treasured I own.    I've listened to it sober, I've listened to it stoned.  I've listened to it in headphones (often!) and on high end sound systems.  I've listened to it laying in bed at night or reading the newspaper during the day.    Whatever the situation , it always puts me where I need to be.
B00005JKC3|4.0|HULK    People hate this film and honestly I don't know why, seriously I have no clue what the problem is. I will agree that this movie is not a classic but I really feel like every time I see it I have watched a truly entertaining film. I think this film is a lot like the comics or at least a lot like some versions of the comics, and it is really a great story. I think that this film has a lot of heart which is unusual for this type of film, most comic adaptations are action based as were this one seems more character driven. This film was not given the credit it deserved and neither did the cast or crew.    Bruce Banner is a young researcher that is not only in love with his fellow co worker but is also drawn to studying gamma radiation. Of course every one knows that an accident happens at the lab that exposes him to those rays and when those rays mesh with the present inside his body that his long lost father left him, well he turns green. From here we have a whole story that involves love, a father who only wants to use his \\"experiment\\" I mean son, and the military. All of this put together makes for one interesting film, a lot better then I thought it would be. Plus the battle at the end is cool and that is always a plus.    Director Ang Lee who is a wonderful filmmaker did a marvelous job with this film, he turned what could have been just your basic comic movie into a more dramatic tale of tragedy. His direction in this film can be felt all through out the finished product and I really think that he was the perfect choice for this film. Credit of course should also go to writers James Schamus, John Turman, and Michael France who really did something unexpected with this film. This movie is a real emotional based story that relies more on the characters then the action, those three should be complimented for penning this. Frederick Elmes shot this film masterfully and Tim Squyres's editing is flawless, every one should be commended. Eric Bana is completely believable as Bruce Banner and does a real good job with this part, lot of people said this part should have went to some one else. Jennifer Connelly portrays Betty Ross extremely well and I don't think any one would disagree with me on that. Sam Elliott, Josh Lucas, and Cara Buono all are good in this film as well and each of them really make this film all the more entertaining. But it is Nick Nolte in my opinion who really steals the show on this one as Bruce's long lost father who is extremely obsessed with continuing his work. So much so that he doesn't even care about his own son although it seems that he does for a while. In fact it is the dynamic between him and Eric Bana that really make this film, very emotional between these two.    Of course not every thing about this film is great, there are a few things that keep this from being a classic. I think the main thing that brings this film down a little in many peoples minds is the length. This is actually a fairly long film that at times feels like it is dragging, so I can understand that. I think because this was more character driven and played on the emotion of the characters a lot it tended to let everything play out a bit slowly. Another thing is that the CGI in this film is not exactly the greatest ever, in fact the Hulk looks more cartoonish at times then intimidating.     Still even with those flaws I still think that this was a good movie, much better then most people give it credit for. Who knows maybe because so many others hated it I liked it, but I did.    Also this film has some great special features including a nice commentary by Ang Lee

Though it's been several years since I read it, what stick out in my mind the most is Stephen Kings words \\"just write\\". I had no idea how to even begin, let alone if I could finish a novel. He gave me the okay, and the courage to just start and see where it leads. I was too focused on the how's and what's...all things that had hindered me from starting. He also offers some helpful insight to how he accomplishes his own writing.

B00169N0BK|4.0|I used to do \\"trial and error\\" color calibration...print a few things, adjust colors and so on. After a while, this got so frustrating (and expensive, due to the wasted prints) that I decided to take the plunge and buy a real calibration tool. No regrets...what I see on the monitor is much closer to what I print, and the whole calibration process (which I guess I was a little scared of) was no big deal. Just a few minutes every so often, and you've got dramatically better results. Highly recommended.<br /><br />Two things I'm not thrilled with, though. One is that printer profiles don't seem to work properly with my Epson R2880 printer. The calibration process works, but when I try to use the calibrated results, prints come out splotchy and distorted. This might very well be some sort of problem with Epson's printer drivers, but for now, I'm stuck with standard profiles.<br /><br />Other thing I'm not thrilled about is the license model Colormunki uses. I have a laptop and two desktop PCs, and my laptop gets connected to multiple monitors depending on whether I'm home, in the office or on the road. I can understand that Colormunki wants me to buy multiple copies of their product, but I didn't understand there was a limit to the number of PC/monitor combinations I could use with their product. I'm sure it was in the fine print somewhere, but it took me by surprise that I couldn't simply calibrate as many computers as I might want with a single copy of their product.<br /><br />UPDATE - January 2010<br /><br />Still using the Munki with good results and the two problems I mentioned have been fixed. The problem with my R2880 was apparently Epson's and was corrected by maintenance in their drivers. The licensing issue, as others pointed out, was fixed by the Munki folks. I've since added a 27\\" iMac and a new Epson 7900 to my collection, and not only has the Munki helped me calibrate each one optimally, they are also much more like one another so I can view or print from any system to any printer with no surprises.h no surprises.
0316776963|2.0|After all the amazing reviews I heard about this book, I maybe laughed out loud twice. I didn't find anything cutting edge about his humor, it was predictable and often downright boring.

B0004Z33G4|5.0|My husband is a huge Rambo fan so I had to buy this for him.  The movie quality is good and it comes in a box to hold the set together.  Great value also because each movie only costs about six bucks.
B000FFJYCU|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies of all I. I couldn't wait for them to come out with this in DVD and now I have it Excellent.
0061544493|3.0|Gorgeous photography in this book, but of course Victoria is stunning so its hard to go wrong. Besides the pictures though, not much substance. Rather boring.
0307269191|5.0|As a lifelong professional writer and a 5-mile-a-day runner since 1980, as well as 1985 completer of the Boston Marathon (and approximately the author's age).... I LOVED this book! Period!
B0006AAS5G|4.0|After reading all the reviews online I decided to purchase this watch. That was almost a month ago and so far I am very happy with it. It keeps very accurate time (it is a quartz after all) and it looks great. The chronograph, however, doesn't work the way it's supposed to (according to the manual, when you reset it, all three subdials are supposed to go to the 12 o'clock position but only one of them does. The other two are pretty much useless). I kind of expected for that to be the case after having read the reviews on amazon so it wasn't a huge surprise and I decided to just keep the watch for the looks. I gave it 4 stars because the watch came with a label that said \\"list price $355\\" and for that price I would except a fully functional chronograph. Another thing I don't like with this watch is the fact that the second hand always stays in the 12 o'clock position. Sure, you can start the chronograph and that will make it start ticking but the user manual says this watch is not designed to have the large second hand ticking all the time (personally I prefer a sweeping second hand, but this is not an automatic watch). In conclusion, if you're after a good looking watch that keeps accurate time, you'll probably like this watch. If you're after a chronograph, you'll probably want to go for something a little more expensive. Hope this helps.
B00124FQCK|3.0|What should have been a marriage made in h*ll didn't quite make it. The combination of Black Sabbath with Ian Gillan doing lead vocals would appear to be the perfect combination. Unfortunately it was short-lived, maybe with more time, another album, this incarnation of Sabbath might have reached greater heights. It's certainly one of the most intriguing formations since Blind Faith. Born Again went to #39 on the charts but there wasn't a charting single.    The album opens with \\"Trashed\\" which is a pretty good rocker. The second song is \\"Stonehenge\\", an instrumental that's mostly keyboards & effects. It's mellow by Sabbath standards but it is still interesting. Next is \\"Disturbing the Priest\\", a great Sabbath title & has a certain presence that's ethereal & frightening, malice abounds in the song. Gillan is a MUCH stronger vocalist than Ozzy but for some reason Gillan just never quite fits in. Next is a short song, \\"The Dark\\", that comes in at 0:45, it's an instrumental that's been slowed down considerably from its original recording speed. \\"Zero the Hero\\" is the album's centerpiece, it sounds like it could be from the Ozzy years. It has a great rhythm with Iommi riffing like he used to. \\"Zero the Hero\\" definitely ranks up there with classic Sabbath. This song seems to seethe with malice & the force of it is primeval in nature. Gillan's vocals are exceptional. And when Iommi goes into his solo one might swear he can feel a demonic presence slithering around the music. KILLER! \\"Digital B*tch\\" is next & is the weakest song on the album though I love the title. It's the shortest song on the album that's not an instrumental. Iommi does play some inspired solos in the song. \\"Born Again\\" is one of the album's best songs albeit a slow one. This song actually sounds like a song that's part Sabbath & part Deep Purple. Deep Purple fans will recognize Gillan's voice & sentiments on this one. The effect-laden guitar that Iommi plays is very effective. Gillan shows off his vocalrange in this one. Near the end of \\"Born Again\\" Iommi gives one of his most soulful leads of his entire career. \\"Hot Line\\" is the last standout song of the album; sounds like Ozzy's Sabbath in this one. If it weren't for Gillan's distinctive voice some might think this song was from the Ozzy era. The album closes with \\"Keep It Warm\\" which is a metal blend of Sabbath & Purple though not as good as \\"Zero the Hero\\", it's real sludge.    The combination of Gillan & Black Sabbath could have reached greater heights, I believe, if they had recorded a couple of more albums. There was just too much potential here for something substantial not to have come out of it.
B000003CMC|5.0|Living in the south, The Allmans Brothers Band acquired somewhat of a saintly status during the early 1970's. It reminds me of the carefree days of riding in the back of a VW Van and going up to the Atlanta Rock Festival or anywhere in Florida. It seems as if every van and car was listening to either The Allmans or Grand Funk. Time has proven that the Allmans' Eat A Peach is a genuine masterpiece. Songs like One Way Out, Little Martha, Blue Sky and Ain't Wasting Time No More have proven the test of time. This was Duane Allman's swan song before his tragic accident in 1971 and remains my favorite Allman Brothers album of all time. They were the greatest live band I ever saw too.
B00192KCQ0|5.0|I have to admit I was worried about this release...although St. Anger was a step in the right direction.  Not only is this album heavy, but the songs are well written, and what we like to call riffarama!!  They have not written songs like this since And Justice For All, in fact, this should have been the next record.  Do not listen to bad reviews from LOAD fans..this is the king!  I have listened to Metallica since I first saw them at the Old Waldorf in San Francisco in 1982, and this could be in line to be their best opus.  Every song is an instant metal classic, in line with Slayer, Exodus, etc.  Thrash metal 80's, here we go again!  Welcome back METALLICA!

0385340990|1.0|My book club chose this despite none of us having read it. That was the mistake! Yes, there were some moving pages but not much else. There are many other more worthwhile books out there. The authors seemed like they had a plan but it fell apart. The only thing I enjoyed was the  title!
B00192KCQ0|5.0|Metallica has roamed and explored the rock Circuit just like most famous bands have done through history. Yet Metallica fans feel they are singled out. Blame it on Grunge/Alt rock (and Bob Rock) since metallica's rise to mainstream paralleled the Nirvana/PearlJam/AliceInChains movement.<br /><br />Death Magnetic rocks hard for most of the album with its frantic drum bass & guitar noise, but like the Modern Metallica, there are moments where the pace slows down to actually allow the listener to breath. If you enjoy Kirk Hammett guitar solos this album is for you. Death Magnetic actually is closer to \\"And Justice for All...\\" than \\"Black\\". If you are searching for instant Metallica radio classics steer clear, this album is suited for grown-up Metallica fans. It is a new chapter in the bands legacy
B0018TLRT0|5.0|The album pictured is the 25th anniversary edition of Parallel Lines with extra cuts not on earlier releases.<br />Parallel Lines may be Blondie's masterpiece.

It is an essential album in any serious music lover's collection.
B0011KQSZ4|5.0|\\"Death at a Funeral\\" was truly the greatest comedy of 2007.  A film in which the acting outweighed the billing of the actors.  The writing was superb, the delivery was deadpan, the casting was perfect.  Every detail was so precise.  The pacing was flawless, and the music was great.  Rent it, watch it, try not to love it, I dare you!
B000AM6OQ2|5.0|This movie was great. The music was eerie and spooky. The atmosphere was moody. The story was entertaining. Need I say more? John Carpenter is a genius at creating unique films full of suspense and mood. THE FOG is a fine example. In the 80's Carpenter could do no wrong. He directed and shot brilliantly(panavision, widescreen, POV, wide angle shots from eye level) and he scored his films brilliantly. Check out the rest of his 80's cinema Fantastique! ( ESCAPE FROM NEW YORK, THE THING, CHRISTINE,STARMAN,BIG TROUBLE IN LITTLE CHINA, PRINCE OF DARKNESS,   THEY LIVE)
0670034711|5.0|I just finished my second reading and loved it equally as much, if not more, than the first time. Elizabeth Gilbert has a beautiful gift. I'm more envious of her ability to write so eloquently than of her year living abroad...
B0006B2A2E|5.0|This is a great collector's edition of a great movie. I bought it as a gift for my husband, and he absolutely loved it. Very nice shiny packaging also.
B0019HQIGS|5.0|I highly recommend this DVD! I'm amazed with John's performance, the best i've ever seen. Two words, buy it!
B0017MO10U|4.0|First: I love the Stargate series and have the entire collection on DVD. Stargate is the best SiFi series ever created. Continuum was a needed fix for any SG1 junky.  I hope that there are many more SG1 movies to come or better yet, bring the series back for a few seasons....  Second: What happened with Richard D. Anderson, Brigadier General, USAF? He was advertised to play a larger role in this movie not a small teaser appearance. It felt like he didn't want to be there. Many feel that his wise cracks and \\"poke fun at the man\\" attitude portrayed by his character made the show. I am not knocking Gen. Anderson; he is one of the best actors of the 20th / 21st century. But if he is going to play O'Neill please do it full force or don't tease the fans.   Third: I thoroughly enjoyed the movie but the magic was subdued. This would have made a great TV Special Event to be released on DVD after it aired. Billing this as a \\"Major Motion Picture Event\\" is misleading. The \\"lost in time\\" and \\"alternate time line\\" has been done to death. With the entire universe just one Stargate step away why rehash an old story line. This was a missed opportunity to WOW the fans and pick up more followers.    Fourth: I love the SG series. Seeing the entire SG1 cast together one last time was amazing. \\"Rest in peace Don S. Davis.\\"    Give us MORE, MORE, MORE!

B0012Q732O|1.0|Wow.  This was actually a script that somebody wrote?  And worse, got paid for?  I've read better stories on the back of a shampoo bottle.  \\"Wash, rinse, repeat.\\"<br /><br />At 50 minutes into the film, I had to turn it off.  I didn't care one bit about any of the characters and I certainly didn't care for the nonexistent storyline.<br /><br />The only positives that this film had were the animated sequences with the primitive creatures such as woolly mammoths.  But those were few and far between.  The Discovery Channel offers better depictions of life during prehistoric eras.
B00006WUWQ|4.0|The first two DVDS are great.  Stupid but extremely quoteable and humorous.  I did not like the third installment.
B00004YA0T|5.0|This box set a must-have. Actually, Eugen Jochum recorded all Bruckner twice. First one with Berliner Philharmoniker for Deutsche Grammophon at 60's, the second is that one with Staatskapelle Dresden for EMI, 70's. Well, it's a little complicated to choose one, because both of them have different qualities. But, I suppose, that Dresden version is more transparent, dramatic and intensive than Berliner version.<br /><br />Eugen Jochum is a master on the music of Bruckner. His reading way is totally opposite of Celibidache. Celibidache has the majesty, the sustaining of time in the manner of Zen On the other hand, Jochum has spontaneity, dramatic intensity. You will not bore in any little moment when you're listening Jochum's Bruckner. The Staatskapelle Dresden sound is so precise, clear in every minimal detail, you can hear all the counterpointal subjects and parts, very deep and satisfying bass sound, touching strings (just check the Adagio of 9th) and glorious brass section (check the complete 7th).<br /><br />The most interesting points that I shall say are: the 4th is really very interesting, I haven't listen any version just like that, it is not similar to any reading. One hour long that symphony moving on just like a few minutes. Especially the last movement has an enigmatique intensity. The 7th is one of the best available. The majesty of the firs movement, the solemn and desolate Adagio which is written for death of Wagner, the Shcerzo which will make your tension up and again, a majestic mood, Finale.<br /><br />The 9th! I think, this is the best ever! How Jochum make that music such dramatic, you can imagine a master composer now near to death and hardly working on finish his last symphony... The string tremolos at the very beggining sounds like nothingness. And then 8 horns coming just like the meaning of life. The sarcastic and devilish Scherzo, may be the best Scherzo of all Bruckner. And \\"farewell\\" Adagio, begins with full singing-strings, and time is now sustaining, there is nothing going on,just the end of everything and waiting for the last breath. And there is a huge climax includes a dissonant chord, just like the dissonant chord of Mahler 10th. But then, fade away...<br /><br />If you're searching for a really defenitive Bruckner performances, you should get that. Highly recommended.
B0017I1FO4|3.0|This is my second Shinedown Cd and they have become one of my favorite bands, Im not one to review song by song, but this is a cd that I can put in and listen all the way through!
B000PTYUQG|5.0|This is really a-must-have. One of the most significant composers of 20th century, Igor Stravinsky and almostly complete works with his own performances. All the records between 1950-60's, except some chamber and solo piano music performed by composer and recorded monorual in 30's. All the records' sound quality are really great, like alive. The orchestras are: Columbia Symphony Orchestra (based on Holywood), CBC Symphony Orchestra (Canadian). There are many brilliant soloists such like Isaac Stern, Charles Rosen, Shirley Verrett, Cathy Berberian (the wife of Berio), Philippe Entremont, in Les Noces four pianos are: Samuel Barber, Aaron Copland, Lukas Foss, Roger Sessions! The dream-cast!    This set includes so many works, which they're not so famous, but very interesting. When I bought that set, I listen for first time The Flood. That work is one of the lastest musics of the master and written in 12-tone system, but it has very amazing moments. His very last work, Requiem Canticles, such a dramatic and desolate music. But there are some brilliant and funny music just like Circus-Polka, which there is a quote to Schubert wonderfully, and Jeu de cartes, which is very colourful ballet. And there is one more very interesting music which impressed me: Abraham and Isaac, a sacred ballade. With its' Hebrew language, it sounds so different, worth to listen. This box set includes definitive readings of majestic Oedipus Rex, his three symphonies, and some rehearsal sketches, which are very interesting.    The recording of famous The Rite of Spring is very carefully performed in the manner of rhytms, accentuations. The same rhytmic quality can be seen in The Soldier's Tale.    Highly recommended.
015206396X|4.0|This is an amazing fantasy novel with a wonderful heroine.  Katsa is strong and has depth and her character is allowed to evolve.  Katsa could have been another one dimensional character of YA Paranormal romance adventure like Bella Swann, but instead you get a kickass heroine that can definitely think for herself and is very much her own person.  I also really liked the concept of the Graces, there is great development about the unique talents called the graces and Kristin Cashore does a great job of writing the concept without making it too elitist.  By using the word Grace, she gives a softer more realistic concept of a special power.  The romance in this novel is not cloying and annoying; it is a solid developing relationship between two people.
B001G7CAGI|2.0|I watched the second episode immediately after the pilot on TiVO just to make sure the it was as bad as I thought.    The cast does a great job with what they are given, but that makes it all the more difficult to watch. As written the show is a mash-up of X-files, CSI and countless conspiracy/shadow govt shows. And while the Fringe of the title refers to Fringe Science, there is little science involved.     A show so similar to others should come with its own mythology and should stick to the \\"science\\" it lays out. That is what allows suspension of disbelief. Instead there is a collection of set-pieces with no coherence--a cow is requested for testing apparently for the comic shot of cow being walked down a crowded university hallway; later, when a translucent FBI agent's body is wheeled into the lab, we can only assume he also had to come down the same hallway???? And that FBI agent, initially kept in isolation, body super-cooled, is later laid-out in an open lab, the only cooling apparatus a beer-chiller pack covering his nasty bits.    There is much more wrong, but suffice it say the cast is to be admired, the writers fired.
1401216676|4.0|This is the re-colored special edition of Batman: the killing joke.  Brian Bolland's illustrations and colors are really stunning.  It's quite timeless. Alan Moore's writing is exciting and easy to read.  Wither you're a beginner to graphic novels, or a long time fan of batman, this is an essential book at a great price.  It is a quick read that offers a lot of insight to the psyche of the Joker.
B00192KCQ0|4.0|I'll make this quick and simple: If you still love Metallica, you will love this album.     It's basically an album that combines everything they've done up until this point. And for fans of their old school album formula, you will love this, as it's exactly what they did with Lightning, Puppets, and Justice: 1st and last song: hard as hell, 4th song: ballad, 2nd to last song: instrumental, almost all songs: very long and epic. For fans of the Load albums (like myself), Unforgiven III will make you happy and you'd probably dig the instrumental, Suicide and Redemption.    The BEST thing I could say about this album is that there's not a single \\"filler\\" song on there. Even the Black album had filler. So depending on your tastes, they haven't put out a completely fullfilling album like this since Justice or Puppets.    I bought it a week ago and I can't stop listening to it! Best hard rock album of 2008, by far.
B000267ZB4|4.0|This is a CD that all tango lover should have. It is a different interpretation of tangos from a master of harmonica.
B001CD6FKS|1.0|First off, this movie looks amazing on Blu-ray.  But everything else about it is a mess.  The story is slow and uninteresting, the acting passable.  All style and no substance on what could have been a great movie experience.
1592402038|4.0|My punctuation is definitely not perfect, but I enjoyed \\"Eats, Shoots & Leaves\\" a lot because I too am frustrated by the insanity that has writers putting an apostrophe before the \\"s\\" in any word ending in that letter! Drives me batty! I believe that the author has tongue planted firmly in cheek and found myself laughing all the way through her book. I am glad that even in punctuation, humor can be found.     It also heightened my awareness of \\"writing right\\" and made me want to do a better job of using reference guides to understand why things are done as they are, instead of just going by the seat of my pants and \\"I think it looks right, oh I'll just throw in some more commas.\\"
0061537934|5.0|Yes its an unusual writing perspective, that of a dog who wishes he were a human, but Stein takes this into the stratosphere with this \\"potential human\\"'s views on his ameteur race-car-driver master's life, loss, marriage, perseverance, love, loyalty, and what the dog would do if he were reincarnated as a man - if you suddenly became a man, what would be most important to you?  I'm a 39 year old man and this story made me laugh out loud, cry like crazy, and made me think about living life in The Now, and appreciating the relationships around you.      If you are a guy (or buying this for a guy) who enjoys racing and has ever been on a racetrack, the car racing narrative is absolutely spot-on.  I have always wanted to explain to loved ones what \\"track day\\" feels like, how you can \\"feel\\" a motorcycle or car around the track at its limits, where you slow down your inputs in order to go faster, and Stein does this in a way I never could.      This was my favorite book of the year and is a great book for every man who loves racing and thinks about what's important in life.
0385720920|4.0|Chuck Palahniuk is in love with viscosity, but that's just an affectation.  Among the puddles, piles, and globules are some beautifully crafted sentences.  He just dares you to wade through the ear wax, phlegm, ejaculate, and other human effluvium to get to them.  What he seems to be doing is reminding us, on the most basic level, what it means to be alive.  That actually works.  His fluid exaggeration isn't, as some have accused him, a gross-out contest, the man simply embraces magic realism on a viscous level.  He does a beautiful job of creating a compelling story that pulls you along and never turns out as you predict it will.  The plot twists are well set up and frankly the whole book was redeemed for me by the point made on its very last page.  So you need to read that far, and then if you're like me, you'll love what Palahniuk says about life.  I have no doubt this guy lives it to the fullest, and despite his desire to try to create a reprehensible character crafted from birth to be as effed up as he is, this is still a book about hope, optimism, and the celebration of the fact that we get one chance at this life, however slimy, and  we should all make the best of that chance.
184195392X|5.0|This is a totally different kind of book than I've ever read. As many others have said, this book is written in three parts.    Part One is explaining how the author came upon the story and the childhood of the main character. It gives you insights into Pi Patels life that help you understand the rest of the book. This part is interesting and is helpful in setting up part two.    Part Two tells us how he and his family are on a cargo ship that sinks and he ends up a lone human in a boat with a Bengal tiger, a hyena, an orangatan and a zebra with a broken leg. After the hyena has attacked the zebra and the orangatan, the tiger attacks the hyena. The rest is an adventure of how this teenage boy survives 227 floating in the ocean. Though I must admit parts of this section does tend to drag on, it is not too horrible to keep reading. Especially since you are dying to know how it ends.    Part three offers a second more probable story, that makes you rethink the whole book and will leave you thinking about the book long after you are finished and searching for anyone who has also read it so you can discuss it with them.    This is a great book to read in a book club (and I highly suggest it.) As for it making you believe in God, that is up to the reader to decided!
B0019UGYK0|5.0|i love this movie, it is an american classic. so many great small actors that get little recignition from the main stream HOLLYWOOD. SO MANY great lines that we remember as kids growing up. this movie was made on a modest budget, but looks very complex on the big screen. you will enjoy this movie if you like a vision of the old south, a big piece of americana.
031606792X|5.0|This books was great. Everyone keeps saying Stephenie Meyer doesn't know how to wrap up a series. I loved it. I thought to ending was great(and I was Team Jacob). Stop saying how the books should have ended, you aren't the writer of the book. Stephenie is the author she can write it however she wants to. And I think she is one of the best authors around.    I have also read about people saying the die hard twilight fans seem to have the same opinion on the books(which is bad). I am a die hard Twilight fan who has been reading the books since the week Twilight came out.    The books is definitely worth buying. I went all over trying to find it since I came back from a trip to Europe August 3rd and than found out that every book store near me was sold out and that I would have to wait till August 5th to see if there are any copies left that they had on hold. I did get lucky and got one of the last two and a book store 1 hour away from me.    Stop hating the book. I am sure it wasn't what any of us expected, it was a surprise and I thought it was a good surprise.
B00005K3NY|2.0|This movie appears to be a possible transfer from a vhs tape.  The film is not clear and the color is terrible.  Not much care was put in placing this movie on dvd. When there is a closeup of the cast speaking, their lips do not move with the words.  I was very disappointed in the quality of this dvd.  This movie is good and should have looked better on dvd.  Two stars was given because it is a good movie. I have this movie on vhs, and could have saved my money by not buying the bad dvd.  Save your money.
0446402389|4.0|A time and place is introduced to many in this mystery. The ending is hokey, but the trip to Stalinist Russia is worth it. Trust no one. What life is like, when family friends strangers will rat you out in case they are suspected of sins against the state. Fascinating.
B001BKXUOQ|4.0|as a long time slipknot fan, I was looking forward to this CD. I believe that VOL III was a masterpiece. This CD sounded a bit lame the first time I listened to it. However, after driving around for a couple weeks with this CD blasting - I have come around to really like it. While it's far from their best effort, it's still a must-have for metal fans. I would say roughly half the songs are great, while the other half seem like leftovers that didn't make it on previous CD's.  Again, this is not Slipknot's best CD, but a great metal CD.  And with Metallica's god-awful new one, this is the best new material out there right now.
0143038419|4.0|This is definitely a good read for those of us who haven't been through a mid-life crisis but would like to consider it.  What would it be like to divorce, quit your job, take a break from the hectic world we all know, travel and consider God?  Not only an enjoyable read but thought-provoking as well.  I'm definitely going to visit Italy now.
6305428352|4.0|\\"Mr. Holland's Opus\\" is an excellent movie!  More importantly, however, the introduction of Jean Louisa Kelly's George Gershwin solos to movies -- particularly \\"Someone To Watch Over Me\\" -- is incredible, and just plain sensuous!  I find myself drawn to hear her sing it over and over.  But the subplots of Holland and his son, of the love story between Holland and his wife, and of the incredible affinity between Holland's music students and him, are also excellent.  All in all, worth a mature family's watching.
1400064287|4.0|Overall, this was a good book; it provides the reader with important insight as to how important it is to create a message that is understood and remembered.  It also gives you a step-by-step process on how to create these memorable messages.  Make the message 1) simple 2) unexpected 3) concrete 4) credible 5) emotional and 6) a good story. This is one of the more important books on how to get your business message communicated, and it tells you how to do it.    The only reason that I didn't give this book a 5 star, is that the middle of the book was a real yawner - the book could have been just as effective (or more effective) at 200 pages.
B000PTYP7U|5.0|I honestly can't say one bad thing about this album or about the band themselves. Paramore has been one of my top favorite bands. A year later of listening to Riot and I'm still not tired of the songs yet. Hayley has such a strong voice and this is definitely their best CD yet. Highly recommended. Favorites include: Let the Flames Begin, Misery Business, Crushcrushcrush, and When It Rains.
B000002A3T|4.0|This review is a personal tribute for Richard Wright who died this week, for all of us Floyd fans a very sad moment.     Since Wish You Were Here, Wright did not composed music for any album of the band; on Animals and The Wall he just graced the music with his excellent and unique Floydian keyboards; he was not on The Final Cut; on A Momentary Lapse of Reason he was a session musician due to some legal details and just played some here and some there; which leave us with The Division Bell, his major return to full composing status: Cluster One, What Do You Want from Me, Marooned, Wearing the Inside Out, Keep Talking. All of them, not only beautiful and elegant songs, but Floydian.    I'm very amused when I read some reviews that claim that this is 'soft rock', this is a tremendous musical misconception, comparing Pink Floyd with Hall & Oates, just because the playing is 'soft' or not 'hard'. Look again, the only 'soft' aspect in this album perhaps is Nick Mason's 'soft' drum playing, nothing else. This is indeed a dense album, musically, production wise and in the lyrics. Not only the band is playing in full spirit since Animals, but Floyd is there, now with Wright's important contributions: Marooned shares the same status of ANY Floyd ethereal classic, with its haunting piano, keyboards and guitar; Wearing the Inside Out is in the same vein of Summer 68 and Stay, vintage Floyd songs from the pre-Dark Side era    Only for the songs that Wright composed,  this album is a must for all Floyd fans; any Roger Waters hardcore fan who thinks he IS Pink Floyd, is missing a whole and huge point of why Pink Floyd is what it is. Marooned won a Grammy for Wright and Gilmour. I rest my case.    Other songs like Poles Apart and High Hopes, would be missing a lot without Wright at piano, keyboard, organ and kurzweil command.    With Wright gone, a imposible to fill gap leaves Pink Floyd without the secret weapon to construct its typical unique and more than excellent music. A Musical Master who will be missed for the rest of our lives, but will live forever in every meloniac, for all ages to come.

0439023483|5.0|The description for this book is short but it gets right to the point. I found it intriguing which is what made me decide to give this book a try in the first place. I must say that this is one of the more enjoyable books I've read in a while. I've read other complaints that the book doesn't go in depth enough about the world outside of the games through the eyes of those watching (especially Kat's family) and I agree that I would have liked to have seen more. However, unlike the other reviewers I don't think this took away from the story. I would like to have had more detail only because I didn't want the book to end. I thoroughly enjoyed the weaving of the story that the book could have been twice as long and I would have wanted more. To me, this is the sign of a well told story. I found myself buying into the characters, sympathizing for some and hating others.<br /><br />When my wife read the book she couldn't put it down. She had to go out to run some errands and couldn't wait to get back home in order to continue reading the book.
B00005JM8V|1.0|Disc 1 has problems. During chapter 40 the film freezes and won't play that chapter beyond the point where it freezes unless you skip ahead to the next chapter. Haven't watched the remaining discs yet, so I'm not aware of any other problems with the other discs.    I've emailed the company to get a replacement copy and they have yet to respond.    Very frustrating especially for such a large ticket item and an amazing film.
031606792X|5.0|I was impressed with this end to the Twilight series. I couldn't put it down, again, like all the other three books. I read to lose myself in a story, and it doesn't necessarily have to be true or realistic or have a moral message. The truth is, Stephenie Meyer created four novels, and novels are FICTION. Her books were, as far as I am concerned, very excellent FICTION. If people are worried about how their teenage daughters will feel about \\"Bella getting everything in the end\\" you are not living in the real world. Books, fictional stories, should be interesting, and not all books or fiction have a moral message. Some books are just meant to be ENJOYED. Aren't we adults supposed to be encouraging our teens to read? If the book was not interesting, they'd never finish it. And if all books that our teens read must have a moral message, I don't think very many teens would want to read. For goodness sake, let the teens lose themselves in the fantasy, the FICTION. Life for teens now is hard enough without adults forcing them to \\"be real\\" all the time. And, all you nay sayers, don't you remember Nancy Drew books? Trixie Belden? Those weren't science fiction or paranormal or fantasy books, but they weren't always REAL either. So what? Kids need to be kids, so let's let them. P.S. I'm a grandmother of a 15-yr old who enjoyed all the Twilight series books, and many of her friends did as well. They all know the stories are fictional, and they aren't expecting to fall in love with a vampire and a werewolf/shape-shifter next week at their high school. Duh.... as the kids say.
B0000CAXID|3.0|3 1/2    A good argument the multi-talented Grohl and his new project as guitarist-singer in this more-poppy-but-still-plenty-rocking band was poised for longevity, but undoubtedly starts off stronger then concluding.
0439023483|5.0|From the ashes of the civilization that was once North America came the Capitol, nestled high in the Rocky Mountains. Surrounding the Capitol are the thirteen Districts. As time passed, the Districts rebelled against the Capitol's harsh rule. Their punishment was the creation of The Hunger Games. Each year each District is required to send one boy and one girl to the Capitol, and there they will be thrown together in an arena and forced to fight to the death. Their fight is broadcasted on live television, and each citizen from all Districts is forced to watch.     In isolated District 12, Katniss Everdeen passes her days in school and illegally hunting in the woods beyond the fence that encompasses their community, scavenging and bringing down game to sustain her family. But when her younger sister is chosen to represent their district in the games, Katniss wastes no time in taking her place, even though she knows it mean near certain death. But when circumstances beyond her control twist the Games around, she'll have to fight against both the Games and what she knows is right in her heart to keep her life. One thing is for certain--people will remember this year's Games for a very long time.     Suzanne Collins has created an absorbing and utterly fascinating look at a futuristic world where a government has employed a brutal and heartless system in order to maintain complete respect. She paints a picture of a plausible future, adding to it interesting tidbits of information that you would come to expect of your average science fiction novel--mutant species, hoverboards--while at the same time showing readers a simpler view of life--homes without hot waters and towns barely able to feed themselves.     Collins' heroine Katniss Everdeen is a fierce and determined, angry at the ways of the Capitol, but conscious of the fact that there is nothing that she can do to protest. Her fear is tangible as she approaches the Games, and her wonder at a lush life in the city infectious. However, she really shines as she is immersed in the Games, where her wit and intelligence make themselves known, without understating the fact that she is a scared girl, struggling for survival. Hers is a coming of age story as she is forced to decide what she believes in and act accordingly amidst brutal circumstances.     Though the book doesn't introduce topics with quite as much depth as expected, it doesn't avoid them all together. Katniss's insecurities about death and love, for instance are still very present, and it is evident that throughout the story the author is laying the groundwork for the next two books in the Trilogy.     With an unexpected ending, dashes of tongue in cheek humor, and lots of quick thinking and riveting, suspenseful moments, The Hunger Games succeeds in capturing attention, and provoking thoughts. In its own way, it ranks high up along with Scott Westerfeld's Uglies series and Neil Shusterman's Unwind; a completely scintillating book and wholly promising start to what's sure to be a spectacular trilogy.
B000001E18|4.0|Often misunderstood release which continued the pop experimental elegance found on their landmark shift AB, although with more emphasis placed around having fun instead of drama (\\"Stay (Faraway, So Close!)\\", admittedly one of the disc's most powerful tracks sounds like the only cut that could have made that previous release). Although the disc could have ended a little more triumphantly (even though the Cash song has only grown in stature), Zooropa still comes loaded with interesting production and sleek, easy-going arrangements.
B00192KCQ0|5.0|On Death Magnetic,Metallica prove that they are back in a big way! Actually,though,they never went anywhere.Allow me to explain:  Here is a brief history of there discography:1982-Kill em all-solid debut of California style thrash.  1984-Ride the lightning-an significant improvement over Kill em all,showing longer songs,and improved instumentation.  1986-Master of puppets-arguabley their finest moment.  1988-And justice for all-IMO their finest album in terms of songs,however,somewhat marred by poor production.  1991-Black album- a much more commercial sounding,rock album.  1994-Live @!$#-binge and purge-box set of live material  1996-Load- a continuation of the style first seen on the black album.More blues orientated.  1997-Re-load-Not b-sides as some have claimed,but songs that were not yet finished when Load was recorded.Much more experimental in nature.  1998-Garage Inc-collection of cover songs from entire career.  1999-S&m-Live album featuring band with the San Francisco symphony with orchestrations from Michael Kamen. The only Metallica album I cant stomach(sorry,but as a classical music fan,and musician,Kamen's orchestration's are horrible)!  2003-St.anger-Much maligned,raw underproduced return to roots.I am probably one of the few that actually Liked this album.  Now that I have summarized their album's,let me just say that Metallica have always done Exactly what they have wanted to do.  On this album,Rick Rubin has persuaded them to return to the sound of Master,Justice.However,to me,it is really a combination of all their previous work.  As for the production,well,I havent yet listened to it on headphones yet,but it sounded great on my stereo.  As for the songs themselves,I won't give a track by track breakdown,but I will just say that I love them all!(The exception being Unforgiven 3,which I find interesting in that people seem to like this song,despite not liking the Load album.This is the one song that Metallica would not have done in the '80's)  Allthis being said,I do think that this is their strongest work in 20 years(although I love All their album's(except S&m).  Metallica has returned to some,but to me they just continue to make great music,as always!
B00192KCQ0|5.0|In most cases, when a review describes a band as \\"taking a step back\\", it's bad. But Metallica has gotten back to their roots, and it's music to the ears of any fan of hard rock.    Now, is it as good as \\"And Justice for All\\" or \\"Ride the Lightning\\"? I don't think they've gotten completely back to that point and they come out a bit flat with some of their weaker songs like \\"Unforgiven III\\" and the first radio single \\"The Day that Never Comes\\". Although these songs aren't bad, they're not excellent like the rest of the album. My favorites are \\"That was just your life\\", \\"All Nightmare Long\\" and the instrumental \\"Suicide & Redemption\\".    Welcome back Metallica.
B00192KCQ0|4.0|This is by far Metallica's most triumph return.  I thought they never play this fast again.   If you like the speed of Kill em all and The solid force of Justice album, than this album is for year.  Recorded with that new bass player guy and also being on a Warner label with producer Rick Rubin, made this the most aniticipated album of the year.  This album is a silent killer, it will haunt you in your sleep, it will grow on you.  It is Magnetic.  By far the Best song \\"Broken, Beat & Scarred\\".  Why are you reading this review, go out and purchase this album.  It is the soundtrack to all that ends all, Death.
B00007FOMP|5.0|I agree with the many reviews that rate this a classic album. I know more people who bought this album, than any of the other great soul albums released in the early 70's.   I have several other Marvin Gaye albums, but this is the only one I still play all the tracks.  It's so sad his personal life was ruined by drug addiction.  This is beautiful, heartfelt music.

B00005JPY0|5.0|Having worked in psychiatry for 37 yrs., I found Heath Ledger's character, The Joker, to be incredibly perfect and sublime in his portrayal of an uber-intellect psychopath.  This would not be the smash hit it is without his substantive performance. All the actors, of course, are wonderful, Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman, also pulling off parts of tremendous impact to the audience. Ledger, being the brilliant method actor he was, may have embraced this dark role too deeply, perhaps leading to his demise.  Such a profoundly sad loss, but between Brokeback Mountain and Dark Knight, his daughter will know, eventually, her father as an outstanding actor.

B001DRF84W|5.0|I think this is another case of the domino effect. One critic gives it a bad review, the next does, the one after that will, and then swarms of people just watch it, looking for the problems the critics point out and call it a bad film. I think we should be able to form an opinion on our own without letting some desk jockey who hates movies to drive us to his or her own. Let's face it, it's not as bad as it was made out. It is a dark complex character driven movie. It's not the 2008 version, blah blah blah. Of course it isn't. But it is STILL VERY GOOD! Both copies of Blu Ray will sit right next to each other on my shelf, even as different as they are...they are still the ever Incredible Hulk!
6305922756|5.0|I remember catching this film on MTV many years ago; I caught it about midway through, watched the rest of it (while laughing me bum off), then made a mental note to myself (\\"I've got to get this movie!\\").  Well, some twentysomething years later, I now have the Special Edition of THIS IS SPINAL TAP.  Better late than never, as they say; was it ever worth the wait.<br /><br />Tongue-in-cheek parody is comic gold when done well; and this spoof of the heavy metal hair bands of the Eighties simultaneously pokes fun at the genre while paying reverent homage.  (Heck, the actors even play their own gigs and songs.)  An alleged \\"documentary\\", brought to us by legendary (in his own mind) producer/director Marty DiBergi (Rob Reiner, who did indeed direct the film), THIS IS SPINAL TAP tells the story of England's \\"loudest\\" rock band--and of its three core members:  lead guitarist Nigel Tufnel (Christopher Guest); co-lead guitarist and vocalist David St. Hubbins (Michael McKean); and heavily-moustached bassist Derek Smalls (Harry Shearer, whose poorly-played rifts are hysterical).  The band is in America on tour to promote its latest album (\\"Smell The Glove\\"); over the course of this tour Murphy's Law reigns supreme, to the detriment of the band--and to the delight of the viewer.<br /><br />From Guest's outlandish lead solos, to McKean's horrific lyrics, to the actors' over-the-top Manchester accents, to \\"flashbacks\\" depicting the 18-year history of the band (and its 37 drummers, all victims of bizarre accidents), this \\"rockumentary\\" is hard core comedic bliss.  All the scenes are improvved; how the actors got through them with straight faces beats the stuffings out of me.  (I'm still in stitches over the scene where the band gets lost trying to find the stage from the dressing room.)  Oh, and look for brief appearances by the likes of Bruno Kirby, Ed Begley, Jr., and Billy Crystal.  Yet after the movie's over, it gets even better. . .<br /><br />Special features.  This Special Edition includes numerous outtakes (some entertaining, some not so entertaining), some \\"music videos\\", some \\"commercials\\", the theatrical trailers, and a special commentary that puts the proverbial cherry on this sundae.  Voiced over by Guest, McKean, and Shearer, the actors reprise their roles as Nigel, David, and Derek, and comment about the film expressing righteous indignation over the \\"hatchet job\\" director DiBergi did about their beloved band.  Their ad libbed voice-overs, from scene to scene, are just as entertaining as the film itself, making THIS IS SPINAL TAP a crowning comedic experience.<br />--D.

B000OYC7A8|5.0|I bought this based on the reviews out here, and boy were they right!  You come to expect the musical perfection from David Gilmour, and these DVDs don't let you down in that regard, but the visual spectacle is amazing.  Even w/o the Blu-Ray version, the crispness and colors make this a DVD worth watching time and again.  As far as the special guests, I love them all, but David Bowie's version of Comfortably Numb surpasses them all!
B000RZIGZ4|3.0|I first saw Top Gun in the theater when I was in the 7th grade. It was AWESOME! Watching it almost 25 years later, I can't figure out what the hype was about. The story and aerial dogfights made for good Saturday matinee popcorn fare, but it wouldn't hold up in today's market. As far as the Hi-Def version of the movie goes, I was happy. The aerial scenes weren't shot in Panavision and you can tell the film quality wasn't as good. The rest of the picture is pretty great, as is the sound. The Blu-ray version uses the same transfer.

0380713802|1.0|Why did Mr. Bryson write this book?  Was it to discourage people from traveling in Europe?  He is disappointed at every stop he makes - perhaps had he planned a little better, that would not have been the case.  In addition, Mr. Bryson forgets that he is a tourist and that people actually live their lives in the places he visits - they do not live there to accomodate tourists or Mr. Bryson.  Do yourself a favor - don't buy this book.

0142001104|4.0|The book could definitely be categorized in the \\"self-help book\\" field, but it is more creative and the examples are excellent. If you decide to get this book, and do not know who the authors are, make sure you check out a video on Youtube. Ben Zander follows the rules of the book and you can see it in his energetic, child-like attitude. Some of the rules may not seem as relevant as others, but your sure to find something you can improve on. This book is great for leadership programs and really helps you to learn your strengths and weaknesses.
031606792X|3.0|(Sorry, but some spoilers.)    I really enjoyed reading this book mainly because of the fact that it answered the questions I wanted it to answer. Unfortunately Stephanie Meyer should have stopped writing after she answered those questions. I loved the book up to page 500 or where the whole \\"vampire fighting over Renesmee\\" thing started. By that point, I had lost all interest because of too many characters and no fighting. In the end, the Volturi just backed off anyway.     I loved the first three books of the series but this one was a let-down. I have told all my friends to stop reading where I wish I would of. I just wish somebody would have told me the same thing before I wasted valuable time reading a pointless ending.
B0007ODLCS|5.0|Townes Van Zandt has a lot of CDs available and not all of them are good. Be careful what you buy. Check out the reviews and track listings on Amazon first. In my opinion there are too many later CDs which are just repacked old songs with little or no new material. I love his music but I am not prepared to pay full album price for one or two songs. Therefore I was unsure where to start with his back catalogue then I found this boxset.     The box set is amazing value. You get Townes first 7 albums (and arguabley his best) plus a live CD for $20 or so. All of these CDs contain Townes songwriting at its most prolific and his best. The first CD contains his first two albums and is possibly the weakest (but by no means weak) of the set.  This is because of his first album which was overproduced and they added in some questionable (on some tracks) backing arrangements to Townes' songs. This is particularly noticable on the classics like Waitin Round to Die. This does not ruin the songs but it is not the way the songs were meant to sound (compare the 1st version of Tecumseh Valley from his first album on CD1 to the second version also on CD1 but from his second album) and by all accounts Townes himself was not overly impressed with the sound of his first album.     For those unaware of Townes, his songs vary between country, folk and blues. My personal favorites are when Townes' songs are at their most dark, vulnerable, fragile and beautiful. However, he also does some good upbeat numbers, talking blues and humourous songs. Townes was a poet and as such expect to find most songs filled with beautiful and intelligent lyrics. He was not the greatest singer in the world but his voice fits perfectly to his own songs and I have not heard any better versions of his songs than his own.     Townes did re-record many of his best known songs on several of the albums here so there is some repitition but the songs are so strong that you cannot get fed up hearing them and there are also many hidden gems that I fail to understand how they are not better known (such as \\"Like a Summer Thursday\\" and \\"Snow Don't Fall\\").     I am reviewing this box set and not Mr Van Zandt as a whole but in my opinion the albums in this boxset are his best and are pure classics that you will come back to time and again and never tire of listening to. Townes was a very flawed character and as such his talent suffered. He was never as prolific again in his career but there are some decent later albums that contain mostly new material and I am now seeking them out.     Townes Van Zandt seems to instill a strong sense of loyalty and awe amongst those who appreciate his music. Will everyone like this? No of course not but his talent cannot be denied (I don't doubt Madonna's talent but her music just isn't my thing) and if you like (mostly acoustic) folk, country and blues then you should love Townes. Once you have discovered him you will want everyone else to hear and like his music as much as you do. I haven't and probably can't (in words) say just how much I love these songs. This is by far the best CD (for value and content) that I have ever bought.
B001FEA9QU|1.0|\\"Death Magnetic\\" shall forever reign as the poster child in the \\"loudness wars\\" currently taking place in the music industry.    As a long time fan of the band - having been listening since the first \\"Metal Massacre\\" comp appearance, I can  say that, musically, this may be some of their best material since Puppets.  Unfortunately, it's utterly ruined by the most egregious example of digital clipping distortion due to an almost mind-blowing degree of compression.  How Lars and James could have allowed this out the door in this condition is unimaginable.    My recommendation?  Wait until they fix it - there's quite a buzz (no pun intended) on the internet right now about it and I hope that the band steps up and does the right thing.  In the mean-time, I've requested a refund from Amazon.
B0001WTWCO|5.0|It is an interesting film, but not more than that. What does it shows? That the English were particularly sectarian during WW2 on the African front. Nothing new under the sun. Anyone who had a slightly different name or a slightly surprising or uncommon attitude was at once considered as a spy unworthy of any trust. This created myriads or even legions of misunderstandings and human errors along with cruelty,  barbaric acts, violence, etc. The only interest of this film is the technical brilliance in the use of flashbacks that only happen in the head of this English patient who plays the loss of his memory to protect himself against his own name and his own ascendants. Yet his survival is not possible and the nurse who is looking after him is little by little led to being convinced by him that she has to overdose him with morphine, which she does. The sentimental elements along the way for the nurse or the Sikh bomb and mine technician are there only to provide a present time line onto which the flashbacks can be woven and attached. The acting is absolutely outstanding, even if the story is rather trite.<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris Dauphine, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne & University Versailles Saint Quentin en Yvelines
B000LPS4BQ|4.0|I bought the Blu-Ray version because it was a reasonable price and I already had a full-screen copy of the DVD that drove me nuts to watch on a widescreen TV.  This pretty much says I already enjoyed the flick.  It's mindless and fun, and that's what makes it entertaining.    There is definitely better picture quality with the Blu-Ray version when compared to the standard DVD.  There is far more pixelating in the standard DVD that is non-existent in the Blu-Ray version. But, the Blu-Ray version is not as flawless as it should be. Any flaws existing in the original film at the time of transfer (or flaws created during the transfer itself) will make their way to the high-def disc.     I noticed a lot of very \\"active\\" backgrounds in many of the early scenes.  So much so, it's almost distracting.  At one point, Shaggy's green shirt even seems to be \\"moving\\".  But, later in the movie, everything looks stable and sharp as Blu-Ray should be.  This suggests to me that either the original movie has some flaws, or the there was some kind of issue with the transfer process itself.  Maybe there's some kind of compression going on???    All in all though, for $14 from Amazon, I would still recommend the Blu-Ray version.  Just go into it without an image of perfection.  Sit back, don't be critical and enjoy the flick.
B0011V7P0A|3.0|Over the past 32 years, Tom Petty & The Heartbreakers have given us nothing but great music. These guys have lasted 30+ years and proved that they can still rock and roll just as good as they could when they first started. So, in 1993, MCA (now Geffen) released the classic hits collection 'Tom Petty & The Heartbreakers - Greatest Hits.' The record has now been considered a classic compilation.<br /><br />Earlier this year, Geffen remastered the album and added a bonus track. So, how does this album measure up?<br /><br />Well, when I saw this in the stores, my feelings were mixed.<br /><br />I'm glad to see this album remastered. If you own the 1993 version and you decide to buy this because you had heard that the sound was going to be great, right you are! There is a huge difference in terms of sound here.<br /><br />And, of course, this collection has all the Tom Petty songs the casual fan will probably ever need. 1970s hits like 'Refugee,' 'American Girl,' 'Breakdown,' 'I Need To Know' and 'Don't Do Me Like That' are here, as are his '80s hits like 'Free Fallin,' 'Don't Come Around Here No More' and 'Runnin' Down A Dream.'<br /><br />Still, the three stars are here because of the track listing. Why did they substitute one of my personal favorite Petty songs, 'Something In The Air,' for the 1982 Heartbreakers collaboration with Fleetwood Mac singer Stevie Nicks in 'Stop Draggin' My Heart Around'? I'll confess, I never was crazy about this song, and I definitely think it's out-of-place here.<br /><br />Also, why did they completely remove 'Something In The Air'? That track was new in 1993, meaning it was only offered on the original 'Greatest Hits' album, which is now out of print, and in several years it's going to be a hard-to-find track? They had plenty of room to keep that song and add 'Stop Draggin' My Heart Around' to the track listing. Why Geffen was stupid enough to make that decision is beyond me.<br /><br />Overall, if you can, buy the original 1993 compilation, because the sound quality on that is pretty great too. But, if you are a Petty collector or a fan who is particularly picky about sound quality, buy the 2008 version. Don't get me wrong, besides 'Stop Draggin' My Heart Around,' every song here is five stars. But I question Geffen's decision to remove 'Something In The Air.'<br /><br />Recommended for the collectors and the sound quality-picky Petty fans. Otherwise, hunt down the original 1993 version or just buy his studio albums.t too. But, if you are a Petty collector or a fan who is particularly picky about sound quality, buy the 2008 version.

B0007TKNIS|5.0|Simply superbe !! No more to this phantastic classic /full screen/ version of The Phantom of the Opera. Enjoy it one and once again because it is a treasure and a heritage for the humankind. The story, the music and the film are beautiful.
B00192KCQ0|5.0|Master of Puppets was my baptism into Metallica.  They are why I have been playing the guitar for 18 years and why I wanted to play metal.  I am freakin' pumped about Death Magnetic.  I can close my eyes and listen to it and think back to their classic first 4 albums.    I can actually see them playing every song from this album in concert.  There is not a bad song on here.
B000GPIPSS|5.0|Excellent album for all the tracks it has, not only for the films (English and Spanish version) but also for the documentaries. Don't miss this album if you are a true Bela Lugosi's fan. This special edition for anniversary is of as high quality in its conception. 75 years is easy to say but let's imagine the hard efforts in making the mos famous Holywood's Dracula.

This CD will please both aficionados of Christmas music and fans of James Taylor. he stays true to his \\"sound.\\"

006135323X|4.0|With this week's headlines about the dizzying volatility of the stock market, we've seen investors jump in and out of the game as they've responded to the most powerful emotions on Wall Street: fear and greed.  Surprising?  Not if you're Dan Ariely, behavioral economics guru at MIT. This may be the most entertaining econ book you'll ever read, as you laugh at other people's foibles and then wince inwardly as you recognize some of the described behaviors in your own life.  It may make you swear off shopping, at least for a while.    The basic premise of the book is that yes, people behave irrationally where money is concerned (thank you, Alan Greenspan!).  But Ariely's contribution is to prove, through research so far-ranging it will make you pity his research subjects, a.k.a. Poor Sod Graduate Students, that people behave irrationally in quite predictable ways. We will, for example, almost always report more satisfaction with a product if we know it was expensive--even if that means we give high marks to an ineffective medical placebo.  On the other hand, we will also go to ridiculous lengths to obtain any product that is \\"free,\\" a fact that marketers realize and routinely exploit.  That chapter reminded me of the Simpsons episode where Lisa asks Homer in disbelief if he is drinking blood.  \\"Correction!\\" Homer responds.  \\"Free blood.\\"  Bottom line?  We'll do just about anything to get something for nothing.    There were a couple of great anecdotes in the book.  One was about a company that introduced one of the first bread machines in the world. The trouble was, nobody bought it; people who already routinely made bread at home didn't understand why they would need a machine to help them do it, and those who didn't already make bread weren't about to start.  The company's marketing folks hired a consulting firm, which advised them to also introduce a very high-end bread machine to sell right alongside the other.  It would have all the bells and whistles and be super-expensive, out of reach for most consumers.  The point of this exercise was not to push the high-end model but the basic one, which started to sell like gangbusters.  Apparently consumers love and need choice, and they always want to feel they're getting a deal.  When faced with the option of the high-end machine, they both a) felt justified in buying the less tricked-out version and b) felt that they were part of a movement that was trendy, exciting, and upper-class.  Interesting.  It's similar to the phenomenon in fancy restaurants that might have a $40 entree.  Very few people order it, but its presence on the menu sure makes them feel better about the $26 entree they actually choose.    Another fascinating revelation is that the presence of an honor standard or system really does work.  Ariely find that people were less likely to steal or cheat when reminded of the Ten Commandments, for example, even when they couldn't remember what all the commandments were.  Just being reminded of some sort of honor benchmark (which could be anything, not just something religious) helps to prevent cheating.  Also, people are less likely to steal when the results of their thievery are direct.  In an informal experiment, when Ariely put Cokes in his refrigerator at work, they disappeared readily.  When he put actual cash in the fridge, no one touched it.  As he points out, stealing food and beverages is out of someone else's pocket, as if they had stolen cash, but most people stop short of stealing actual money.  This is why white-collar criminals try to justify their behavior as victimless crime.    It's not a perfect book, and some of the research is too anecdotal to convince Ariely's fellow economists, but for the general reader it's fantastic--well-written, story-driven, and even funny.  High marks.    [This review is also posted at The Review Revolution: janariess.typepad.com]
B000AU9UYC|2.0|I was so disappointed when I ordered this from Amazon! I hate widescreen and having the picture cut so I specifically ordered this so I can get FULL SCREEN! I opened the movie which said Full Screen on the front, only to find out the DVD inside was really WIDESCREEN! How could Amazon do that!? I wonder if they're just reselling movies. Very careless on their part and I would return it except I already threw the receipt away because I had assumed Amazon would get it right. Don't think I'll use Amazon again.
B000VS6P9Q|5.0|Masterful songs taken, borrowed, reworked and then transformed into refreshing pieces of work, that are not quite on a planar level with the originals, but nevertheless graceful and powerfull tributes to Dylan's musical artistry.  It's not just who Dylan influenced, say Jeff Tweedy on \\"Simple Twist of Fate\\", but who influenced Dylan, like Ramblin' Jack Elliot's version of \\"Just Like Tom Thumb's Blues\\", that make this soundtrack truly one of the greatest in recent memory.    34 songs and not a bad one on it.

To show my appreciation for having been able to watch a streaming copy online, I would be more than happy to order the DVD this instant, if only there was a region one release available.    I found the movie visually appealing, and the story kept me interested throughout. Really good movie; I gave it five stars.

B001E5FYS8|5.0|I usually hesitate before hitting that 5 Star choice.  Not this time.  On every level Man on Wire is a superb -- partly, and understandably, recreated -- documentary.  In its stomach-churning tension of man alone in high places it reminded me of the otherwise very different Touching the Void from a few years back.  Even more than the scary -- to us normal acrophobes -- wire work, Man on Wire is memorable for its humanity, for the innocence of the whole crazy idea, for the enthusiasm and excitement that Petit conveys even thirty years after the event, for the camraderie and support that enabled the act, and perhaps most of all for the loss of that once the deed was over.  One of Petit's collaborators is overcome on camera recalling it all.  Most watchers will be as well.  Do not miss it.
B001C4CI8U|4.0|The show was created by J.J. Abrams (Lost, Alias, Felicity).<br /><br />An FBI agent, Olivia Dunham (Anna Torv), along with Dr. Walter Bishop (who is crazy) and his son, Peter Bishop (Joshua Jackson) investigate strange occurrences, called Fringe science, that reside on the extremes of science (reanimation and such). These occurrences are part of a bigger thing called The Pattern.<br /><br />The show is a mix between The X-Files and one of the many cop shows (C.S.I. or any other), completing it with the idea of the monster-of-the-week. The characters are compelling and interesting. And Dr. Bishop holds way too many secrets. The actual interaction between the characters is good with soem comedic undertones whenever Dr. Bishop is involved (he really is crazy and we get to know why later on in the series).<br /><br />The show stumbled in the beginning, especially in the first 2 episodes. But, the series was very enjoyable even though it is an amalgamation and at times copying from other shows (X-Files, Doctor Who).
0385339089|3.0|I've never been a huge fan of John Grisham, but it's hard not to admire an author with such an incredible level of sales success.  Whatever his faults, Grisham is clearly able to connect with his audience in a way that few writers can.  I've read almost all of his novels now, and I think his first two, THE FIRM and A TIME TO KILL, are by far the best ones.  THE CLIENT, Grisham's fourth novel, is moderately enjoyable, but not in the same league.<br /><br />An earlier review referred to THE CLIENT as a \\"Disney movie for adults\\" and I think that serves as an apt description of this novel.  This book is entertaining enough, but I think Grisham's major weakness as a writer is on full display here, because nearly all the major characters are essentially caricatures of one sort or another.  If you enjoy complex, subtle characterization, you may want to think twice before reading this one.  But if you're looking for a highly sentimental \\"David v. Goliath\\" type story, then you will probably be pleased with what Grisham dishes up.<br /><br />Grisham's mains strength is his plotting (he carefully outlines all of his novels in advance), and he structures THE CLIENT in a manner that makes the book a page-turner.  In most of his novels, Grisham is fond of writing about the little guy fighting against the big corporate and/or political interests, and he pretty much sticks to that winning formula here, with an eleven-year old hero battling the mafia and the FBI simultaneously.  While there are some interesting twists in the plot, I found the story's progression and resolution to be quite predictable.<br /><br />I know several people who love THE CLIENT, and consider it one of Grisham's best early efforts.  While I wouldn't put the novel in that category, it's a nice popcorn read, especially for readers who enjoy storytelling that's written in a more traditional, sentimental style.
B000641Z90|4.0|There is no doubt about Phil Collins this past year. He has had a marvelous revival of his work with his days performing as a part of Genesis. Not only did he perform for the first time with them in 15 years, but the sound of Phil, Mike Rutherford and Tony Banks sounded even better than ever. Especially with their catalog being fully restored past and present. That feeling has also been a bit sad for his solo efforts though. He just embattled a tough divorce, and his work with the recent Broadway musical version of Disney's Tarzan hasn't didn't really deliver to those fans that still want Phil to be n their hearts. But, that alone may be as it was, there are still many fans who want him to return to touring on his own. That is shown strong from his last tour back in 2004.<br /><br />Phil Collins recent concert DVD, Finally: The First Farewell Tour is a 2 disc DVD that reflected highlights from an dynamic concert in Paris he performed, promoting for his 2002 album, Testify. Phil's performance was assertive, and brought out a lot of fun and excitement from his classics including Against All Odds, Take Me Home, and the fun fulfilled Something Happened On The Way To Heaven. The songs sound great, but the concert alone isn't enough here to tide Phil Collins fans alone. The DVD set includes a lot of extras, including music videos for his biggest hits including A Groovy Kind Of Love, Don't Lose My Number, as well as some of his lesser-known songs like Hang In Long Enough, Dance Into The Light, and his cover of Cyndi Lauper's True Colors. The extras bring in a lot more appeal that works well not just in the price, but as a great glimpse at how humorous and eclectic Phil has been over the years.<br /><br />All in al, while there have been so many music video DVD's that have lacked heart, and haven't delivered the effort within their price, it is nice to know that Phil Collins is still serious enough to hit a home run with this concert. My one gripe is that I wish Phil could've performed some of other great songs like Everyday, I Wish It Would Rain Down and Don't Let Him Steal Your Heart Away. Nevertheless, this is still a remarkable reintroduction to one of the most serious artists to have ever come out of the 80's. Phil Collins' Finally: The First Farewell Tour is one of the best live concert DVD's I really think is a great addition to your DVD library.<br /><br />Price: B+<br /><br />Remastering: A-<br /><br />Extras: A-<br /><br />Concert: B 1/2+<br /><br />Overall: B+me of other great songs like Everyday, I Wish It Would Rain Down and Don't Let Him Steal Your Heart Away.

B000V63BEU|5.0|While I understand the dismay of some to remixing any of Bob's songs, I think this album is so beautifully done that it transcends most objections.  Any work that brings Bob's timeless music to a new generation is definitely a good thing, and I'm not a rap fan. My two favorites here  are Turn Your Lights Down Low, and Johnny Was, two of the best songs ever written, in my opinion. I think this album is a great introduction, and if you're already a Bob Marley fan (and who isn't?) be sure to check out the original tracks also.  Just a word of warning, though...his music is addictive, I have some on pretty much all the time.
B00000DLV1|5.0|Hot on the heels of two acclaimed studio albums, the trio of Geoff Barrow, Adrian Utley and singer Beth Gibbons toured the United States and in doing so worked with an orchestra and horns for a live release.<br /><br />It is often thought that electronic music is difficult to capture outside a studio, but \\"Live: Roseland NYC\\" is at the very least an exception. Whilst many critics have said Portishead's releases are too similar to each other, a good listen to \\"Live: Roseland NYC\\" with reveal a great many surprises about how Portishead adapt their songs to a concert setting. Contrary to what some might expect all the samples of their studio work are present, notably on \\"Only You\\" where they are used to create a crescendo effect in the middle of the song.<br /><br />The strings add a great deal of melody to the songs compared to the stripped-down versions seen on their second album, but what is really surprising and overlooked in the much greater range of Beth Gibbons' voice found in the live setting. At the end of the dark \\"Sour Times\\" her voice - so restrined in the studio version - turns into an absolute growl that might put off some fans, but is as impressive as anything Bjork could ever manage. The quiet-to-loud dynamic of \\"Over\\" is similar in its effect, notably when Beth sings \\"recognise me any more\\" in an angry tone. On the other side, \\"Half Day Closing\\" is quite remarkably eerie and out-does any post-rock band. The opening tracks, \\"Cowboys\\" and \\"All Mine\\", and the earlier \\"Roads\\" are more akin to the studio versions but their powerful beauty is so unlike most pop music that it always captures the attention of someone weaned on the commercial music of the eighties.<br /><br />All in all, \\"Live: Roseland NYC\\" is the most essential release from Portishead and one of the very best albums of the 1990s. The material is played in a subtly but genuinely darker, moodier, more intense yet more wistful tone than in the studio, and the accompanying orchestra is completely part of the songs as they are arranged. The cover, too, which reminds me of a school orchestra as I once played wihtout success in, is very fitting.ey are arranged.

B001BR5F4C|4.0|While I will forever love these films, I can't still but be a little let down that even in their Blu-ray release we can't get an official unrated version with the full color fight at the house of the blue leaves.   That one fallback isn't enough for me to say stay away from these because let's face it is definitely worth buying these films in High Definition, the clarity of picture and sound is something to marvel at and worth every penny.   If you like these films or your looking for two great films with great witty dialogue, action and great story telling Kill Bill is at the top of the list of must haves.
B00192KCQ0|5.0|Rick Rubin deserves a \\"metal\\". He has thankfully put the \\"metal\\" back in Metallica. This is the album true Metallica fans have been waiting for since \\"And Justice For All...\\". \\"Death Magnetic\\" brings credibility back to the four horsemen after all those Bob Rock years. True, the Black Album was a huge success for them, but that kind of big exposure usually comes at a price. \\"Load\\", \\"Reload\\" and \\"S(hi)t. Anger,(Not counting \\"Garage Inc.\\"), just do not match up to \\"Death Magnetic\\". Thanks Metallica and Rick Rubin for finally giving your \\"true\\" fans an album that rates among (If not) your best ever. (P.S. next time can we hear Rob's bass a little more distinctly).
B000U0F7RG|4.0|The series is phenononal. I believe the best writing on TV so far in the new millenium. I bought this as a Gold Box. Started watching it..again...and it is still fresh, funny, and bright.<br /><br />So the series is 5 plus stars for sure. But DVDs are another story. If you are going to shell out money, I think the 'contract' means you get extras. For a series with so much wit and conversation at its heart the lack of commentaries on espiodes is appaling and inexcusable. The Paladonios, director, and actors OWED it to people spending money to do commentaries. As far as I know they did not, although on some seasons there may be one or two.<br /><br />Now to the case. I was prepared to hate it, but it is actually one of the best things about this set. Heavy vinyl much better constructed than what I believed. But the best part is the clever way of space-saving with the DVDs. They are all in very slim folders. This makes the overall size MUCH less than having 7 individual seasons. Veah the picture choices on the case could have been much better but you know, for the durability and size savings I can overlook that. The two books that are included are decent and fun.<br /><br />So if you have not seen all the espidoes get this for sure. If you have? Well there are extras each season and taken together that is 7 years of extras. However the extras are skimpy and a real shame for everyone involved. Much like the Harry Potter DVDs which inexcuasbly also includes no commentaries kind of a slap in the face of fans.<br /><br />If you wanted to get the series and do not have individual years go for it, real space saver with the box design.

B00192KCQ0|3.0|Let's not kid ourselves people. Yes, this is a better record than St. Anger, and if this has become the new standard for comparison I can understand a 4 or a 5 rating. However, this record sadly does not deserve a 4 or 5 compared to masterpieces like Master of Puppets and Ride the Lightning, and 'And Justice for All'. Yes, on the surface the album sounds like a return to form with a hard edge that harkens back to their roots. But what happened to their lyrics? It seems like James Hetfield just pulled them out of his rear-end. When people compare this to their pre-Black album days, they compare the music but forget to do the same for the lyrics. While their earlier lyrics were thought- and awe-inspiring and added an essential dimension to their music, this record seems to be totally lacking in that department. In fact there is no originality or intelligence left in their lyrics at all. Hetfield is no longer telling stories but stringing some cool/dramatic but meaningless words to go with the 'hard' music. Take title of the album as an example, what the hell does 'Death magnetic' even mean? I mean, please. Also, another annoying thing about the music itself is that even when it is good, it is all over the place. There is very little structure at all. There are some great riffs in all of the songs to be sure, but not nearly enough to make up for the massive deficiencies in other areas. Loyal Metallica fans deserve much better.
B00192KCQ0|5.0|I love this Album! I can't stop playing it...Help!    Every track is Killer, Bass player Trujillo gives the band the   center they need to work with, Hammett's guitar tone sounds perfect!  Hetfield's vocals are the best he has sounded in years, and Ulrich's Drums will pound a hole in your skull!    It's about time Metallica found a producer like Rick Rubin,  who knows how to produce a metal album.    This is the best Metallica Album in a long time!   Anybody who says it's not, is a complete idiot.
031237593X|5.0|I bought this book for my Kindle and am besotted with it.      I read it then read it for the second time without pausing and am now more than half way through a third reading.  It is intoxicating and addictive.  The language is glorious, the ambience exact and the characters full bloodied and three dimensional.  Ms Penman seems to have used Kendall as her primary source and what excellent use she has made of his biography of Richard!  I am left wordless with admiration at the skill with which she weaves the complex strands of the dynastic civil wars into a coherent tapestry of such great beauty.      I would recommend this book to any reader hunting for a richly detailed and thoroughly engrossing tale.  It is quite truly one of those \\"couldn't put it down\\" books which come along only too rarely in today's world.  My only complaint is that more of Ms Penman's works are not available for the Kindle.  I would like to have her complete collection available to carry around with me to read whenever I chose.
B000WGWQG8|4.0|John Adams is largely one of those people in history that all I know is his name and that he was, at one time, a president.  After viewing this miniseries, I decided to look up the historical account of Mr. Adam's life and found that HBO was pretty historically accurate.<br /><br />Paul Giamatti's portrayal of John Adams was realistic and personal.  The series was shot beautifully in historically recreated locations to give the film an authentic feel.<br /><br />If you are an American history buff, I highly recommend John Adams by HBO.

0307269752|4.0|Stieg Larsson has done a remarkable job of setting the often implausible world of the thriller into the real world, where corporate interests are easily as pernicious as the more typical impulses of individual greed and revenge. Not only expanding the range of subjects typical of this genre, The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo plays a number of bright and engaging games with the form, and form in general. While it does not tilt towards the still literary preoccupations of Benjamin Black (John Banville) in his noir transitions of Christine Falls and The Silver Swan, or Martin Amis taking a turn at procedurals in Night Train,  associations fly far and wide, from the seemingly acceptable greed of business in the western world to the vulnerabilities of the information age. Propelled forward with well drawn characters and historical depth, it's a thriller for the thinking reader, imbued with a social conscience that gives this novel more depth and ballast than most. Sorry to learn it will be the last from Mr. Larsson.

The mission is to show that you can make tasty vegan baked goods without the use of animal products. It fits the bill.<br /><br />So while I tend to opt for more healthier versions (not using white flour, etc.), I still think it's a great book to have in my cookbook collection.<br /><br />There was one part though, where she referenced that there was no difference between white sugar and using something like pure maple syrup. This is wrong as there are minerals in pure maple syrup (zinc, maganese), making it a healthier sweetener.<br /><br />I really like all the full color photos in the book and all the extra tidbits of information offered throughout. There are some great recipes included, something for everyone and I can substitute the white flour for spelt flour where desired. I also enjoy listening to Colleen's podcast. This is a good book to add to any cookbook collection.<br /><br />Update: I've now made some of the recipes. Yum! They have been very good. I especially love the lemon bars! They were a big hit at a dinner I recently attended at a friend's house.
B000UJ48U4|1.0|Tom Cruise is a horrible actor who wrecks whatever chance the movie had. This is also one on the most unerotic \\"erotic\\" movies I have seen. Stay way.

B001FEA9QU|4.0|I'm not the biggest Metallica fan, but enough of a fan to hate St. Anger and love Puppets. I don't mind Load/Reload too much. Bands change, people grow up, sounds evolve. I'm OK with that. Some of those songs rocked, albeit in a different way.  I'm kind of torn with this album. Its like they took what was cool about old Metallica and tried to go from there. Kind of a more mature, more produced album, but using the cool old Metallica tricks (copious solos, killer jams, odd timings on the rhythms).   So, what I'm saying is, it kicks butt? Yes, but....   ..I wonder if they are trying to make a \\"Metallica-style\\" album, instead of Metallica's next album.  I kind of think they are out of ideas and they know it, so they went back to their roots to just make Black Album 2.  That said, they do a good job. Good \\"McMetallica\\" still kicks butt. It irks me a little that they are still doing the goofy \\"death\\" themes--death magnetic? How old are these guys?   Broken, Beaten and Scarred, All Nightmare Long, and Suicide and Redemption are worth the price of admission.
B000PMFTDQ|5.0|Is Vier Letze Lieder better served by a lyric rather than a dramatic soprano? Jessye's profound reading of text is always deeply moving, and her supreme legato line and dark oceanic voice is a marvel to hear. She screeches a little on \\"wunder der vor mir\\" in Fruhling, and over-emphasizes or over-expresses \\"es zittert durch meine Glieden deine selige Gegenwart\\" at the end of the song, to its disadvantage, I feel. September is exquisitely sung and ends in poignant tenderness; the way she sculpts the line \\"Langsam tut er die mudgeword Augen zu\\" is enough to make you cry. In Beim Schlafengehen she forces her voice on the line \\"und die Seele, unbewacht\\", reaching for that pitch, but breaks your heart at the end with the sustained crescendo to forte on \\"zu leben.\\" Jessye is good at the ending of songs. Im Abendrot is a slow, pensive meditation, and in the ending line \\"ist dies etwa der Tod? (can this be death?) she conveys a keen but almost delicate resignation and acceptance. I personally think the Four Last Songs are better with a voice lighter in tone and with a more effortless fluidity -- Strauss's extremely demanding tessitura demands such a nimble voice. However, this is a superb recording by a great American soprano, done in 1983, somewhere in mid-career. The orchestra under Kurt Masur is masterful and expressive. Having four versions of these songs (Norman, Te Kanawa, Schwarzkopf and Fleming), I think the Norman and Te Kanawa are, beyond a doubt, the best.
B001BKXUOQ|5.0|Alright, so I became a fan of Slipknot right after the Subliminal Verses, and let me tell you I loved every CD before that too. I even thought their first album, MFKR was interesting (However the original few copies were worth like $600!). Anyway, at first, I didn't favor too much of this album, but like every other Slipknot album, I listened to it more and began to like it more. They definitely threw in some Stone Sour, Subliminal Verses, and even their older lyrical styles Iowa and their self-titled album. Let me tell you, it is awesome, although I didn't care for Vermilion pt. 2. My favorites include:<br /><br />Gematria (the killing name)<br />Sulfur<br />Psychosocial<br />Vendetta<br />This Cold Black<br />All Hope is Gone<br /><br />And let me tell you, the opener and closer were great, so I guess you could say they wrote it kind of like an essay!
B001CVCB9O|5.0|I'll admit I have been a huge Calexico fan for awhile, but each of their albums have had a few songs that just didn't do it for me. Not so with this album, which could alternately be titled \\"The Best Elements Of Calexico From Start To Finish.\\"  If you're looking for Calexico's trademark mariachi-style trumpets married to a modern techno beat, you'll find it in \\"Inspiracion\\" and the guitar-heavy \\"El Gatillo\\".  \\"Two Silver Trees\\" is a superb effort that combines some seriously seductive hooks with the softer side of Joey Burns' amazing vocals.  Like many people, I'm eagerly waiting for another Iron & Wine/Calexico collaboration, so I was delighted to listen to Sam Beam's guest contribution on the exquisitely gorgeous \\"House of Valparaiso\\".  As a whole I think Calexico take a step or two toward the pop side of things, but let me stress that this is not a bad thing in the least. ALL of the classic elements of the band are here in spades - the creative instrumentation, thoughtful lyrics, and wonderful vocal arrangements. This makes for one heck of a fine album, and an extremely enjoyable one at that.
B00192KCQ0|5.0|I'll be honest. A week ago I didn't like Metallica. I was more into the more modern kind of Rock and Metal like Slipknot, Disturbed and Dragonforce. And since the songs are like all 8 minutes long, I didn't favor that either. However, after listening several times, I began to adapt to their voice and become more of a listener, and since I was in the band for 8 years, I can tell they give their own variety of tempo and rhythm. Let me say that I love listening to their guitar solos now, and I will probably be checking out their older stuff too! All in all, this CD really doesn't have any boring tracks on it. It all got my eye!
B00005R24G|5.0|I could not wait to see these two superb acting icons go at it on the big screen.  What a wonderful movie it is.  Great writing, screenplay, and oh what great spins they each put on their roles.  No two other actors could have played it better.  Wickedly amusing entertainment.
B001FEA9QU|1.0|Once again the sell out band of the century put out some crap and want to say that it is \\"old metal\\".  Well, they should really listen to some.  It is time for this lame as hell band to hang it up.  Cliff Burton is spinning in his grave over this crap.  This is a disgrace for any band like this to call itself heavy metal.  Bottom line is this is just another sell out.  By the way...the mixing is even more nasty than on St. Anger...and who the heck thought that was possible.<br /><br />Note to all metal bands everywhere.  Your music is no longer appealing when you have no rage to sing about anymore.  We do not care about James getting clean or the fact that Lars can't get his Lamborghini to start...we just don't care.  Please...we beg you...hang it up while you still have some dignity left.<br /><br />If you want to hear some real metal...listen to SLAYER!
B001BNFR6W|1.0|Another issue that has not been mentioned is that last few seasons were broadcast in WIDESCREEN, and the season sets or the complete series only have the full screen version. Why Lionsgate, why? Getting only the syndicated versions with severe cuts, the lack of the additional West Coast live episodes and these picture format changes are cheating us out of the truly complete DVD experience.<br />The UK version of the Complete Series set (available from Amazon UK for quite some time) had additional scenes or lines of dialogue deleted because it was marketed for getting the Age 15 and upward rating... it looks like the only decent version of these season sets as well as the complete series (real broadcast episodes, widescreen format for the last seasons) are available in Europe (particularly in Holland/Belgium) and Australia (with Region 2 and 4 encoding). I ordered my complete series for about the same price as the US complete set from an Australian retailer.

B000MRA5EM|5.0|This DVD features a wide variety of sea life including: jellyfish, starfish, coral life, strobing squid, sharks, sea turtles, sting rays -even a whale.  My three-year old never gets tired of watching it; he loves the parts centered on the octopus the best.<br /><br />From an adult perspective, I am amazed at how many different species they show (beautiful footage), and it is very informative...great for family time, educating children/students, etc.  I gave it five stars because we wanted a DVD that discusses sea creatures, and that is exactly what you get.<br /><br />HOWEVER, the narration was awful!  We own and rent dozens of DVDs from Discovery, Animal Planet, and National Geographic, and this was the worst narration I have ever heard.  I was surprised, but I guess Johnny Depp & Kate Winslet haven't had much experience with narration...although, I think the script was a big part of the problem (some lines are soooo cheesy).<br /><br />Also, I think the price is way too high for a forty-minute DVD...BUT, when I think about how much my son loves Deep Sea, it is worth the money.  As I said, I gave it five stars because it does deliver the best sea creatures.
B0018AK9RK|5.0|My biggest complaint against Ozzy & Tony is \\"No new material\\".    Wow, Glen and KK and Robert have not only swung out of the park, they tore the cover off it, BUY THIS !!    When Zep released STAIRWAY on IV it took 2 years to grow, the same is here except FM is already invented. There is everything for Priest fans, twin guitars from Sad Wings, it has everything from the past. Buy it, it is the future! A self fulfilling prophesy?
1558216847|5.0|The Long Walk is one of the greatest books I have ever read. The decades long battle over its authenticity is, I think, a testament to its power. Only a work of literature that brings such palpable reality to the reader could have withstood the firestorm of controversy surrounding it from so many corners.     Concerning its authenticity, I think there should be some humility shown on all sides. There are those who would desire to believe it simply because it is a great tale. Others would seek to \\"burst the bubble\\" of all involved out of a cynical doubt in the human capacity for greatness.     Several considerations should be made when considering the recently revealed documents disproving Rawicz's claims: 1. Rawicz' story is too detailed to have been entirely fabricated. Whether or not he himself participated in the events he describes is doubtful, but that the events themselves or something like them occurred is, in my mind, undeniable; 2. Placing a great deal of trust in Soviet documents from the Stalin era has never been a wise course to take. The fact that Rawicz, according to these documents, rejoined the Polish Army the day after he was released from the Gulag (remarkable considering the debilitating conditions he obviously suffered from in later life due to his imprisonment), make it seem a little too clean.     The most likely occurrence, in my own mind, is that Rawicz appropriated the story from a group of survivors who underwent a journey similar to the one he describes. The BBC article makes this clear:    \\"A clue may come from the story of Rupert Mayne, a British intelligence officer in wartime India. In Calcutta in 1942, he interviewed three emaciated men, who claimed to have escaped from Siberia.    Mayne always believed their story was the same as that of The Long Walk - but telling the story years later, he could not remember their names. So the possibility remains that someone - if not Rawicz - achieved this extraordinary feat.\\"    Whatever the case, the story Rawicz communicates possesses a majesty and power that can only belong to the annals of Truth.
0618918248|5.0|I just finished the book two nights ago.  I have spent the last 53 years questioning mainstream religion.  I was brought up Methodist, studied with the Jehovah's Witnesses for several years, attended the Unity Church and now my only contact with any religion is to read the Daily Word of the Buddha.<br />I studied the Bible, I read articles about Faith.  I never could buy what I was learning.  I struggled with the idea of the Trinity (still don't believe it). I had trouble with the idea that you could only believe exactly what a particular religion dictated or you would not be saved.<br /> After many years of this struggle, I decided religion was not for me.<br />I believe in protecting the Earth, treating others with dignity and respect, not lying or stealing, etc.<br />I prefer a walk in a neighboring woods or sitting by a stream and meditating on the world around me rather than going to a church and trying to force myself to believe something that just does not ring true to me.<br />I would recommend this book to anyone struggling with their disbelief that needs some reinforcement that you are not alone.
B0014YPEI4|5.0|I just received mine yesterday and am very impressed, yet again! I started with the T-Rex simply because I'm a huge JP fan, and was amazed with the detail and quality. I went on to purchase the velociraptor and was simply blown away again! I've been holding off on the Spino only because I keep telling myself I don't need to collect anything else, but once I saw the photos of the new Allosaurus I had to have it! The pose is very dynamic and the detail is amazing! These toys are very hefty for their size and almost makes them feel real! The only issue I have is mine doesn't stand up on it's own, but after sliding a dime under one of the toes he now stands on his own two feet.     Highly reccomended!!!
B00192KCQ0|1.0|I want my money back, seriously. Lars wants to sue people for stealing from him? Well look who's stealing this time. Who ever mixed this album should be fired and never allowed near a mixer again. The recording industry is running rampant with poorly recorded albums. The over compression of music has gotten out of hand. I want my own volume knob back. NOW. I sincerely hope this is a wake up call for the recording industry and I hope they agree on some sort of recording standards we can all live with.
0140271791|5.0|First M. Keyes book I bought, and I really expected something lighter.  While it is part of the newish \\"chick lit\\" phenom, it is deeper than such titles as \\"The Devil Weras Prada\\", or \\"Shopaholic\\".  Read it, love it, and then read about Rachel's sisters in \\"Watermelon\\", \\"Angels\\", and \\"Is Anybody Out There\\" (the last is easily one of the best novels I read last year).    So hoping that Keyes gives us one more--there is one sister that doesn't have her own book yet:)
006074815X|3.0|I was incredulous at the end of the book because all I could think was: When Faber went back to the shepherd's cabin alone to neutralize the shepherd, why didn't he send his radio message to Hitler then??? He was alone with a functioning radio and he could have contacted the U-boat that was there to pick him up and he could have transmitted his critical, war-winning news to the Feurer. Why did he come all the way back to the woman, then go through all the drama that followed trying to get BACK into the shepherd's cabin to send his message?? You can drive a tank through a plot hole that big!

B000O599ZS|3.0|Films, like artists or authors, tend to have their critical reputations wax and wane through a few cycles until a consensus is finally reached. Of course, consensus has little to do with real world excellence or failure, but as good an example of this trend as can be shown certainly is John Ford's famed 1956 John Wayne Western, The Searchers. Upon its initial release, the film made a solid profit, and was considered a good film. By the late 1960s and early 1970s, however, film school graduates started championing both it and Ford as more than good, but great. By the 1980s, with the rise of PC, the film's political content and its portrayal of Manifest Destiny came under attack as `racist,' and the film was not held in as high regard for some years. With the advent of DVD technology, in the late 1990s, the film was re-released, and its current status as a `masterpiece' has been little challenged since. Indeed, in watching the special features on the two disk Ultimate Collector's Edition DVD of the film, one might believe that the film is Shakespearean. Assorted talking heads and film buffs gush over the film; even people like director Martin Scorsese. Another great director, Akira Kurosawa, is cited as declaring he learned film technique from watching John Ford Westerns.<br />  Of course, I do not doubt all of these people's love for the film, but love (or like/hate) is a wholly different paradigm from artistic excellence. And while there is no doubt that, technically, John Ford was a superb craftsman- in the framing of shots, in the use of silences that he carried over from his silent film days, in the judicious use of close-ups, and the brilliant use of color in this VistaVision film, it is nowhere near a great work of art. Technique and technical excellence do not equate with greatness. Were that true a poet with a merely flawless ear, like Walter de la Mare, would be ranked along with the Whitmans and Baudelaires. No, there needs to be characterization and great acting. This is where screenwriting and casting come in. The film's actual screenplay is simplistic, larded with stereotypes, and the acting- save for a few scenes where Jeffrey Hunter (as mixed breed Martin Pawley) shines, is self-conscious, poseur, and given that the film is as triumphalist as can be, it makes such preening seem hedonistic.<br />  Naturally, the worst sinner, on this accord, is John Wayne, as the film's putative hero/anti-hero, Ethan Edwards. There is no doubt Wayne had a great onscreen presence- both physically and in his idiosyncratic emoting and speaking styles; but while watching the film, and seeing him strut and spit out trite lines while dickwaving through every second he's on camera, I fully understand why someone like my dad- a left of center trade unionist, found both the man and the characters he played (which were really minor variations on his own faux persona, admixed with testosterone) to be symbols of everything that's wrong with America, past and present.<br />  At first, The Searchers was an undervalued film; now it's a grossly overrated one. The truth lies somewhere between the extremes- something men like John Wayne nor Ethan Edwards ever seemed to learn, no matter how many things critics want to read into a shrug, an akimbo stance, nor an oddly breathily paused clich&eacute; uttered. If John Ford ever did, it was not evident in this film, neither in wax nor Wayne.ting. This is where screenwriting and casting come in.

0060855924|3.0|Yay!  I finally read a Discworld novel.  I was introduced when a friend insisted I watch Hogfather, which I did, and I was intrigued (and slightly confused).  So I decided to start at the beginning.<br /><br />The basic premise is that Twoflower, a tourist with perhaps the most dangerous luggage in existence, has wandered into the twin cities of Ankh and Morpork.  While there, he meets and hires the failed wizard Rincewind as a guide.  As a wizard, Rincewind knows only one spell, though he's not sure what spell and it could mean the end of the world if he were to say it (who knows?).  Catastrophe ensues, starting with the twin cities burning down.  Rincewind can't catch a break, but it seems he's destined to watch out for Twoflower, mostly because the luggage threatens to swallow him whole if he doesn't.<br /><br />Okay, that's the short version.  If you've read other \\"classic\\" fantasy series, or played D&D at all, you'll enjoy the pokes and prods Discworld makes in their general direction.  I thought the book was slow to start, and a bit dry, but once I got settled in Discworld, I was really enjoying it.<br /><br />I've got a long way to go in the series....
B00000APLB|3.0|The Rolling Stones live albums have always been hit and miss affairs. Their success or failure usually depends on their set list, the venue, even the timing of the show (beginning, middle or end of tour). And they have to live up to the standard they set for themselves on their 1969 live set \\"Get Yer Ya-Ya's Out\\". Which is not only the best Stones live set but one of the best live albums, ever.<br /><br />\\"Love You Live\\" was recorded before an explosive crowd (both figuratively and literally) on their 1975 tours of America and Europe (with a 1977 set at Toronto's El Mocambo club thrown in). As far as Stones live albums go, this one is only average. For this tour, the band beefed up their keyboard sound by pairing longtime pianist Ian Stewart with Billy Preston, and added percussionist Ollie Brown (later tours would use a combination of Stewart with Ian MacLagan or Chuck Leavell). But more importantly, this was their first tour with Ronnie Wood. Wood was a last minute replacement for Mick Taylor, who'd abruptly left the band on the eve of the tour and was listed as a \\"special guest\\" on the tour (Wood's memoirs give the full story of Taylor's departure and Woody's entrance into the band. There's a lot more to this story than you'd expect). The set list for this album is somewhat different than most, \\"Fingerprint File\\" and \\"Hot Stuff\\" get suitably funky performances. And \\"Star Star\\" is still a great bit of dirty fun. But the band doesn't sound as tight as on \\"Ya-Ya's\\". So they come off sounding like any other arena rock band of the time.<br /><br />What redeems this set is the 4 songs recorded at Toronto's El Mocambo club in 1977 that find the Stones going back to their roots with covers of songs by Chuck Berry (Around and Around), Muddy Waters (Mannish Boy), Bo Diddley (Crackin' Up) and Willie Dixon (Little Red Rooster). Here they sound loose and fully into the spirit of the music that inspired them, especially on \\"Around and Around\\".<br /><br />As for the rest of thealbum, it's the Stones. In the seventies, Enter at your own risk.

B001BPJJ9G|4.0|A troubled young man, recuperating from a suicidal stunt and a broken heart, meets a precocious little girl with a broken arm.  He begins to tell her a story, but is secretly intending to use her to get morphine that will allow him to take his own life.<br /><br />[[ASIN:B001BPJJ9G The Fall]] is one of those rare films that is both a unique work of cinematic art and a crowd-pleasing gem.  It is both beautiful to look at and has depth that is not apparent on a first viewing.  For beauty and depth and for its approach to its theme The Fall deserves to be compared to [[ASIN:B000O76ZQC Pan's Labyrinth]], and really deserves the level of acclaim that film received.  The film is an intensely personal project undertaken by its director Tarsem, who spent his own money over several years to make it, after studios refused to participate.<br /><br />Critics, however, including those who have reviewed it here, have been divided on the overall merits of the film.  Everyone agrees it is pretty, sometimes astonishingly pretty.  Some critics think that the story is a bit lame -- that the story serves merely as an excuse to present breathtaking visuals.  If that were true, it wouldn't be so bad, but not as good as it could be.  I think such critics are missing the point.<br /><br />What makes the film so remarkable to me is the interaction between the overall story and the story within.  Just as, in [[ASIN:B000TJBNHG The Princess Bride]], it was the interaction between the story and the \\"metastory\\" that added to the charm and allowed the audience to suspend disbelief, it is the interaction between scenes in the hospital and scenes in Alexandria's imagination that add to the charm of this story.  There are, however, significant differences between the approach of these two films.<br /><br />As the man tells little Alexandria his story, it comes to vivid life in her imagination.  It is very much a child's story -- told at the level of a six-year old girl whose world is already a combination of make-believe and reality, who has not fully distinguished between lies and truth.  That fact alone may account for some of the reviews that treat the story as \\"hokey\\" and \\"undeveloped\\" -- it is supposed to be an improvised tale told to a gullible girl.  That makes it very different from, say, \\"The Princess Bride\\" where the story within the story is supposed to be written down.  What makes this film so rich, however, are the ways in which elements from the everyday life of the girl are integrated and transformed into the imaginative world of the story she hears. In fact, the film makes clear that what she sees as she listens is quite different than what he intends: he speaks of an Indian and a squaw, for example, and she envisions a man from India in a turban and a woman with a veil.  As he tells the story, he makes mistakes and forgets things or includes elements she doesn't like and part of the delight of the film is the playful interaction that develops between them as she interjects and he alters his story and the characters of her imagination look confused for a moment.<br /><br />What makes the story rich in my mind, and not at all simplistic, is that this naive little girl comes to see gradually that he is telling his own story and struggles with him to ensure a happy ending.

B00005RYL2|5.0|First of all I have to say that Highlander is one of the greatest fantasy pictures of all time. I saw it for the first time on DVD, the one DVD that Republic put out back in 1997. Now of course I was not too big on picture quality and audio and widescreen ratios but as the years passed my mind changed. The DVD did suck balls despite the THX logo on the front of it. So much for a good transfer. But it was a huge improvement over the theatrical release on videotape. So when I saw the 2-Disc Immortal Edition online and on shelves I decided to have it for myself. I bought this bad boy for only 9 bucks at a Wal-Mart and thankfully Anchor Bay put it out. Now Anchor Bay does a kickass job with their DVD titles and Highlander really comes to life in the Immortal Edition. It does get the THX treatment but with a better quality than Republic's version. Anchor Bay did put out a single-disc version of the film, but come on! I bought the Immortal Edition at Wal-Mart for 9 bucks and the single-disc version was sold for like 15 bucks plus elsewhere. Kind of odd if you ask me. Correct me if I'm wrong, but oh well. Most of the extras do come from the older DVD versions but the Queen CD that comes with the movie is brand new. If you do want to hear all the best songs from the movie's soundtrack buy the Queen Platinum Collection, which is 3 CDs. It's worth it and is a great companion to movies like this, Flash Gordon, Wayne's World, and also The Mighty Ducks. As for Highlander, grab the Immortal Edition above all else. If there can be only one, then the Immortal Edition is it!
0861714911|5.0|This is probably one of the most important books in my Theravada Buddhist book collection; I read from it almost everyday. The translation is accessible and easy to read, and presented an order that provides a structure and continuity not found in the complete translations of the nikayas. With this book, and a handbook on meditation, you'll likely have everything you need to get started on the path. I highly recommend this book to those who already have some understanding of Theravada Buddhism. If you're completely new to Theravada Buddhism, I recommend What The Buddha Taught by Walpola Rahula before this book.

0307269191|5.0|I'm an enormous fan of Murakami's work, and I'm also a long distance runner and a budding triathlete, so this book was almost tailor made for me. I think if you fall into any one of those three buckets you will find this book compelling and enjoyable.    Murakami's insights into the significance of running in the lives of runners is perfect -- it's a very hard thing to articulate to the majority of people who think you are crazy for running and would never do so voluntarily.     Also, the autobiographical tidbits are a joy for Murakami fans: they feel like clues to some of the mysteries in his novels.     I'm not sure if I would take any training advice from Murakami, but I loved the book!
B00001OH7P|5.0|WZZO had just said that this was the #1 gay album as of 2008. I remember it as being high making out with beautiful girls!!! When I Was Young. The CD is Great and in good condition with the lyrics.
B00192KCQ0|4.0|All I can say from my first listen to this CD is Wow, get ready and hold on, cause we're all about to get transported back in time, and quick, to a time when Metallica played fast and furious \\"thrash metal\\".  Only difference is the recording quality is better and more modern.  If you are a long-time Metallica fan, you are gonna be smiling once you put this CD in, push play, and get about 1 ½ minutes into the first track. Lots of heavy riffs, fast drumming, tons of double bass rolls, and multiple time signature changes, and I mean a lot of fairly complex time shifts.  This music will be nothing short of challenging to play in a live setting.  After the major disappointment of St. Anger, I can tell you, the boys have delivered.<br /><br />If you thought the advance single, The Day That Never Comes, was a little \\"light\\" or slightly \\"commercial\\", don't worry, this album is full of the type of metal sound that Metallica pioneered in the early 80's. And if you needed even more proof that these songs aren't just a bunch of commercial pop tunes disguised as \\"Heavy Metal\\", just check out those song lengths!  Over half the songs are pushing almost 8 minutes in length with none shorter than 6:25.  And, to top it all off (and put the final death nail in St. Anger) the guitar solo is back.  Kirk does some serious shredding here. All Nightmare Long is classic \\"old school\\" Metallica in every way. This album is what St. Anger could have been if...Lar's drums didn't sound like he was hitting tin cans and they had let Kirk play actual guitar solos.  I'm telling you, you won't be disappointed.<br /><br />As far as the sound quality goes, the first time I listened to the album was in my car on a low-end stock stereo driving to work.  I was mostly concentrating on the music itself and not necessarily the recording quality, which I thought sounded fine at the time.  My first impression was I was surprised that there was Not a preponderance of bass.  Most modern hard rock albums have so much low end sound I actually have to turn down the bass control when listening to it, so as I pushed the CD into the player I quickly set the bass knob to \\"flat\\" and waited for the onslaught.  After bracing myself for the first few minutes I began to relax and thought \\"Wow, that actually sounds...normal\\"<br /><br />After the absolutely horrible sound of the St. Anger album I had no idea what to expect from Death Magnetic.  I was cautiously suspicious of just how good or bad this album would sound. Like many \\"modern\\" Hard Rock albums that have been released in the last few years, Audioslave and Rush's Vapor Trails come to mind, they are recorded loud, mastered loud, and use too much compression in the mixing process.<br /><br />A few other early reviewers have noted that (in their opinion) there is considerable distortion, clipping, and over compression on this album.  I did not notice this on my first listen, again I was concentrating on the music and not much else.  There was some distortion of the guitar sound, but I expect this from just about any hard rock act.  These guys are cranking it up and using multiple effects, which artificially induce distortion and \\"fuzz\\" into the sound.  No big deal.  Sometimes you can hear the amps \\"humming\\" or AC line noise from power sources.  To me this is just a decision on the part of the producers to Not clean up the sound and present the performance in a \\"raw\\" form.  The only thing that is not tolerated is unintentional feed-back.  Remember how much some \\"fans\\" criticized the overly produced, ultra-clean and polished sound of the Black Album?  Well, you get what you ask for sometimes. Don't be scared off. Death Magnetic does not sound as bad as some people are saying.<br /><br />I decided to sit down and carefully listen to some of these modern albums and compare the sound to Death Magnetic using some quality headphones on my home system.  Audioslave - Revelations (2008) this is a typical modern recording which is highly compressed, creating a \\"wall of sound\\" that gives a loud \\"in your face\\" sound.  Overall frequency response is broad and even with all instruments forward in the mix.  Vapor Trails (2002) has a big, muddy, bottom-end with lots of bass. Distant sounding cymbals, very little hig-end treble. Somwhat distant vocals and guitar. St. Anger (2003), also muddy sounding, practically No high-end frequencies. Cymbals buried in the mix along with most of the drums except that awful snare. All of the fast drumming on this thing is a complete mess. Now we get to Death Magnetic (2008), it has a much broader sound spectrum. Normal highs and lows. The very first track is not recorded as loud as some of the other albums. According to the meters on my Denon CD recorder, there was still additional headroom available for peak notes. The quality of Lar's drumming is much improved and more distinct in the mix. And, IMO, James' vocal delivery is just fine. Most of the instruments are pretty forward in the sound mix (except the bass, go figure), unlike the St. Anger album. The absolute worst moment on Death Magnetic is at the end of track 4, The Day That Never Comes, just past 7:40 the song is horribly over-modulated producing excessive distortion with absolutly no dynamics, but IMO, that's how the artists want it presented or it wouldn't be that way.  20 seconds here, 10 seconds there, is a small percentage of the album to complain about and not enough to give this one star! Is the album compressed? Yes, about 95% of the time. Bad clipping distortion? Maybe 2% of the time. And for all those people that are hoping for some kind of \\"remastered\\" version of this album, forget it. If Rush wouldn't remaster Vapor Trails (and it really needed to be) don't expect Metallica, or better yet, Warner Bros. to fix this one. Ain't gonna happen.<br /><br />Overall, Death Magnetic has some of the best music they have done in years, so do yourself a favor and check it outt gives a loud \\"in your face\\" sound.

B000OPPBEQ|5.0|It is an interesting concept to review an HD product before it is available to objectively review, however I did want to offer a couple comments on the Matrix trilogy. First, I agree with another reviewer that the fundamental premise of the global movie (all 3 movies) is interwoven and consequently none of the 3 movies can truly stand alone. The movie is about more than just action and mayhem and has many deep social themes. One must watch the trilogy in series and back to back multiple times to appreciate the brilliance of the story. I give all 3 movies 5 stars as in my opinion they deserve the highest rating as they are perhaps the best science fiction movies ever produced.    Will they be significantly better in HD, I don't know but I can say that when I watch the standard def versions up-converted on my Blu-Ray player and HDTV they look remarkably better so I'd have to conclude the Blu-Ray versions will be even better. However, I doubt that I will pay the asking price for what could be a marginal improvement over what I have now, plus I bought all 3 standard def movies out of Wally World's $5 DVD Grab Box.    Once the Blu-Ray versions are released and reviews are posted I may change my mind but a more appropriate price for this set would come in at under $50. Who knows, in a year maybe I can get the set at Wally World for under $30??
B00122PUS2|3.0|It's now hard to remember how Collins and the rest of the Genesis crew were able to continue Peter Gabriel's legacy.  This recording is testament to the possibilities that PG's departure opened, certainly not as 'pop' or commercial as subsequent titles, this is a must in any serious cerebral or progressive rock collection.  The album better reflects the changes in the band's evolution, if you only buy one song buy Ripples.
B00001ODGR|5.0|I always thought that the Eagles were the American Beatles.  However, I now think that Styx is battling them for that title.  Three great songwriters and singers, great musicians all, diverse music and lyrics - I'm really impressed with these guys - Tommy Shaw and Dennis DeYoung, in particular.  Too bad they split up.  I hope they have a reuinion tour sometime soon.
B00005U122|5.0|At nearly 2.5 hours, this concert DVD is an incredible bargain -- the equivalent of two CDs for less than the price of one. If you're an old Pink Floyd fan like me, you'll enjoy Waters' rendition of classic cuts from The Wall, Dark Side of the Moon, and other PF epics, interwoven with a sprinkling of material from Waters' post-PF career. As other reviewers have noted, the visuals are pretty lame, but the music is great, and that's what counts, at least for me. If half-star ratings were allowed on Amazon I'd go with the consensus of 4.5 stars. Definitely a bargain at the price, though!
B000XTLUW0|5.0|It's quite disappointing to see some people dismissing this as another live album/DVD not deserving of attention.    This is a true reflection of the energy, dynamism, creativity and imaginsation of MUSE.  I'm old enough to remember \\"Live & Dangerous\\" being considered one of the best live albums, but listening to it now it sounds bland compared to MUSE at Wembley.    The camera work and editing is terrific and completely reflects the atmosphere and energy in the band and the crowd.  The frantic cutting in Stockholm Syndrome reminds me of the mosh pit.    I suspect those not impressed have never seen them live.  Go see them then revisit the DVD.  If it doesn't light up your eyes then you have no soul.    CD: There isn't a duff track  DVD: I can skip Soldiers Poem.  Don't miss Knights of Cydonia, Feeling Good, Blackout, Plug In Baby, Stockholm Syndrome
B0012OQZWA|5.0|As has become more apparent in recent years, extreme metal bands can come from literally any corner of this toilet earth. In fact, there are so many of them on the market today that it is impossible to keep up with all of them, and the countries they come from. And although it's safe to say that the countries located to the east of the Atlantic take up the lion's share of the attention (namely Sweden and other Scandinavian countries), one would be sadly mistaken to overlook or discount the United States just yet. One such case in point is one very special band that hails from Topeka, Kansas (where, by the way, zip codes begin with the numbers 666 -- you just can't get more metal than that!) named Origin. And, in addition to having a locale in the U.S.A.'s heartland, this quintet's sound could also not be more American because they stay close to home when looking for inspiration. (Their main influences are from the likes of Cephalic Carnage, Dying Fetus, and Suffocation.) As a result, Origin's renowned death-grind assault is an insanely fast, technical, tight, and brutal one. And, in this day and age, it also sounds fairly novel and refreshing.<br /><br />It feels almost redundant to say because any well-versed metalhead will find it obvious, but the musicianship heard on \\"Antithesis,\\" Origin's fifth and newest record, is nothing short of incredible. After nearly a decade of existence, the band is now, finally, firing on all cylinders, and as a result, they sound like an extremely well-oiled machine. John Longstreth cements his status as just about unparalleled by any other drummer on the metal scene today. He drives the beast forward with truly impeccable, explosive, pummeling, lightning fast blast beats that spit sparks and debris like shrapnel. In other words, he is the audio equivalent of The Energizer Bunny...on amphetamines! And while Longstreth's style of drumming has all the nuance of a two-by-four to the skull, his playing is always impossibly tight and precise, so it manages to retain a certain level of finesse.<br /><br />The guitarists are also in fine form here, as their guitar work has never sounded so intricate. It is safe to say they have mastered the art of technical, thrashy riffing, rip-roaring leads, blistering tremolo picking, fluid sweep picking, and occasional pinch harmonics. And not only that, but they've also learned how to create guitar solos - and really memorable ones, too. Elsewhere, frontman Paul Ryan turns in a noteworthy performance, as well -- his Deicide-worthy array of growls, screams, and bellows is powerful, visceral, vitriolic, and just plain wicked! Finally, the icing on the cake is bassist Mike Flores, whose instrument is much louder in the mix this time around. He comes up with surprisingly interesting and memorable bass parts that make sure the rhythm section is rock solid.<br /><br />But instrumental prowess will only get you so far - no matter how friggin' amazing it is!. Well, that's not a problem here, either, folks. See, unlike, say, 2005's disappointing \\"Echoes of Decimation\\" (Origin's last release), this record adds quite a bit of substance to its style. For starters, the arrangements are tempered with some undeniable moments of melody, but it is done in a way as to avoid any annoying Swede-inspired cliches. Furthermore, there is an abundance of honest-to-goodness hooks, fairly accessible song structures (including some actual choruses!), groove, tempo variation (i.e. some breakdowns and other slow/er passages to add texture and contrast), ear-snagging guitar riffs (opposed to just one, long wall of guitar noise), and -- get this! -- standout tracks and songs with memorable parts.<br /><br />Finally, and perhaps most importantly, \\"Antithesis\\" possesses one last attribute (which makes it a huge step forward for the band): a little, intangible thing called \\"feeling.\\" These ten songs cut deep; they send off wave after wave of furious energy and palpable intensity. The face-rippingset opener, \\"The Aftermath,\\" engulfs the listener's eardrums with a flash flood of frenetic, scalding riffage, grinding, \\"rat-tat-tat\\" machine gun blasts, and thunderous rhythms. Some strong bass work (i.e. a grumbling bass bottom and a split-second interlude/solo), a mid-tempo, chugging breakdown, and a nice, Necrophagist-esque clean solo are also tucked into the mix here. \\"Algorithm\\" continues down that song's same path, and, thanks to a brief but wild, shredding guitar solo and nonstop hyper-kinetic, skull-splitting drumming, it completes the album's beginning one-two punch knockout.<br /><br />The next two songs might darn well be the catchiest Origin have ever written. Both of which are backed by irresistibly hooky, crunching, lock-step staccato rhythms that will be almost impossible not to headbang along with. Plus, the former tune, \\"Consuming Misery,\\" also has interesting, slap bass lines; and the latter, \\"Wrath of Vishnu,\\" features a frantic, pummeling, stop-start drum intro and awesome, ripping, and even borderline wailing guitar solo that gives Nile a run for their money in the bluesy, Middle Eastern-influenced metal department. Next up is \\"Finite,\\" a disorienting, head-spinning, uber-fast blur of dissonance reminiscent of Psyopus. \\"Void,\\" an futuristic, mildly bone-chilling interlude, is another standout, as is \\"The Beyond Within,\\" which begins with a jackhammer-fast rhythm that falls from the sky like a ton of bricks before abruptly doing a 180 degree turn and trafficking in a quiet, restrained passage complete with interesting, slapped bass lines.<br />But the set-closing title track is the indisputably biggest highlight to be found on the album. In fact, it is also, by far, Origin's most intricate, expansive, infectious, and flat-out mind-blowing piece of work to date, and an absolutely must hear. It is a stunning, epically epic, infectious, innovative, nine-and-a-half-minute-long maze through effective groove-oriented parts, haunting ambience, swift guitar sweeps, stellar melodic soloing, and occasional black metal tendencies.<br /><br />Let it be known that \\"Antithesis\\" isn't really, well, an \\"antithesis\\" per say, because it doesn't mark a drastic change of sound or direction for Origin. What it certainly does do, though, is deliver on the promise of all of their previous releases. It sounds like the band you've always known...but now they are substantially even better than before. As such, it is very much up for debate if this record will gather much attention from anybody who isn't already a fan. Plus, some listeners (especially first-timers) will find the Kansas-based quintet's music to be a bit unusual and overwhelming. But regardless of comparisons to previous works, \\"Antithesis\\" is, at the very least, an excellent, brutal, exhilarating, and accomplished affair, an early juggernaut for death-grind in 2008, and a great case against writing-off American extreme metal just yet.set opener, \\"The Aftermath,\\" engulfs the listener's eardrums with a flash flood of frenetic, scalding riffage, grinding, \\"rat-tat-tat\\" machine gun blasts, and thunderous rhythms.

B000002IOW|5.0|There is so much texture and complexity on this Rush album, it's hard to find a place to start.  In my opinion, the band has given up since this album.  Not that post-Presto Rush albums are bad, they just do not have the masterful song writing and lyrics that Presto has.  There are 3 stand-out tracks, \\"The Pass\\" is one of the best Rush songs of all time.  \\"Available light\\" is the sleeper on the album, a pure gem buried as the as the track on the album (ala \\"Between the Wheels\\") and \\"Hand Over Fist\\" a powerful, well crafted song.  I didn't even mention Show don't tell, which has one of the most amazing bass lines of any Rush song.  A true classic.
B00006LPER|1.0|It's hard to say what this film is about. The plot has been repeated by others. In summary, the piano teacher follows her sexual fantasies down a path that leads to her destruction. It is as others have said a disturbing film, but for me this is not a compliment. There is little in the film worth taking away. The teacher herself is not especially interesting. She is abusive, mean-spirited, aggressive and destructive as a teacher. She maims one of her charges because the young girl dares to smile at the teacher's new sex toy, a young stud who has convinced himself, unconvincingly, that he loves his tyrant teacher. She is not just perverse; she is criminally insane. Her mother, who is every bit as sick and twisted, is a sexual voyeur and tormentor who exploits her daughter's bizarre sexual predilections which include porn shop cruising, drive-in movie peeping, and self-mutilation. Once she gets her hands on her new charge, she presents him in writing with a list of perverse demands. The handsome boy realizes that he is dealing with a sicko and runs for the hills. She stabs herself. I got little out of watching this mess. Who's to know what it all means or what the author intended. I came up with the idea that this \\"World\\" is meant to be \\"Vienna,\\" Europe's literal or symbolic music capital, a city of beautiful music and the birthplace of Hitler and the author, even though Paris has been used as the film's setting by the director. These two \\"sides\\" of Europe seem to coexist, according to the author, but we are given no hint as to what one is meant to do with this knowledge.

I am familiar with all the main actors, including Meryl Streep, Pierce Brosnon and Colin Firth but was not aware they were such entertaining singers as well.  If you are a fan of ABBA you of course will love this CD but even if you are not, I think you will find it very enjoyable.  The tunes are really catchy.  Also, the movie is a very enjoyable musical.  Meryl Streep can do anything and the men are quite handsome! Next step for me will be to see Mamma Mia on Broadway.
B000OVLBHG|5.0|Why write review number 775, you may ask?  Starship Troopers is a movie very loosely based on an excellent Robert A Heinlein SF book from 1959. In the 1990's Director Paul Verhoeven tried with notable failure to make this fine story into an antiwar movie. Heinlein's story was just to good for Verhoeven's limited ability to ruin. There are two ways to watch this movie. Strait up as a good action adventure, or as a comedy. For the comic effect play the directors commentary while watching, and laugh as he tries to explain how this action movie is really an antiwar film. Its like getting two movies in one. You can enjoy the comedy even more if you read the short (205 page) novel first. you can read any of the other reviews for the story line ect.
0307388840|2.0|I won't reiterate the pros and cons of this novel, which many talented reviewers have done before.<br /><br />I only want to pose a question to all readers -- because, having read the book through twice, I still don't get this part:<br /><br />Lola and Paul Marshall.  First he assaults her and she covers for him (falsely blaming her little brothers); then he rapes her and she covers for him again; then she marries him.  WTF?<br /><br />Alternate interpretation:  They have consensual rough foreplay the first time; then consensual sex; and then she marries him.  This would make sense -- if only I could convince myself that a 15-year-old upper-crust girl in 1935 England would have rough foreplay with a man she'd just met.<br /><br />Alternate interpretation:  She fought him off the first time, then had consensual sex the second time; then married him.  Nope; that's another WTF.  What girl of that era -- or any era -- would willingly have sex with a man who had just assaulted her?<br /><br />I'm lost.  Somebody, please, explain Lola's motivation to me.  Otherwise, I am forced to go with my gut interpretation:  Lola's actions make no sense, but we're just supposed to accept them because she's (a) a villainess and (b) a female (and therefore can be dismissed as irrational by nature), and (c) a minor character, quickly dispensed with, whose main duty is to be a Contrivance of the Plot.<br /><br />Booker Prize, anyone?

B001AW9DKK|5.0|I'm not sure if I fall into old school or new school (I'm 35 in a few weeks) about my review.  But I'll agree with some of the other reviewers, it's about damned time someone with some cajones put out an album like this.  Welcome to America, where you can believe what you want, agree or disagree about whatever you want to, protest for or against what you believe in, etc.  If you can't handle it, leave.<br />This is a great album, with great music, and great lyrics.  I think with Neil, this is more of an album of \\"Here is what I believe, do with it what you like.\\"  There is no quarter asked, none given on this album.  It was also great to hear the four of them singing. I feel they are the best harmonizing band ever.  And they also have enough guts to take a stand, whether you like or agree with it or not.  I only wish \\"Ohio\\" had made it on the album.<br />All in all, a great album, a great listen, and great protest music.  It's your patriotic duty to be out there banging the drums of protest about what you believe in and Neil and CSN do that brilliantly here.<br />Whether you agree with this album or not, thank a vet you get to live in a country where you have freedom of belief and can say the things on this album without getting arrested and/or shot for saying it.
B0014DBZY2|4.0|I saw Foals live last weekend (more on that in a bit) and immediately went out and bought their debut album. Foals has created quite a buzz in their home country of England on the strength of early singles like \\"Hummer\\" and \\"Matheletics\\", and finally in Spring, 2008, the debut album arrived.<br /><br />\\"Antidotes\\" (14 tracks, including 2 bonus tracks; 53 min.) starts off a bit tentative with the misleading sound of \\"The French Open\\" but then immediately finds traction with \\"Cassius\\" (2nd UK single), followed by a blazing \\"Red Socks Pugie\\" (3rd UK single). The highlights keep on coming, including \\"\\"Balloons\\" (1st UK single), and even better the 1-2 knock-out punch of \\"Heavy Water\\" and \\"Two Steps Twice\\", the absolute highlights of the album. Ican't stop listening to this album, and that is saying a lot. After a 54 sec. gap (which is credited somehow as a \\"track\\") following the proper 11 tracks of the album, this US edition also includes 2 bonus tracks, the afore-mentioned early singles \\"Hummer\\" and \\"Mathletics\\", which fit in perfectly with the proper album. In all, this is quite the debut album, just outstanding.<br /><br />Last weekend I was at the Monolith Festival at the fabulous Red Rocks outdoor arena just outside of Denver, and Foals played an early afternoon set that simply blew me away, bringing a lot of the tracks from this album, none better than \\"Heavy Water\\". Their set was the highlight for me of that 2 day festival, bar none. \\"Antidotes\\" is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED. If you wonder where you can hear these guys, check out WOXY (\\"The Future of Rock and Roll, BAM!), the internet-only station that brings the best indie-music in the country, period.
2070513289|5.0|I'm not gonna write a paragraph about this literature, but i will say this...<br />I cried and laughed and at the end i felt overwhelmed with this book..its all there and i think everyone should read it. the best book ever. Ive read a lot. This one has my heart.
0385340990|5.0|Having been to Guernsey twice to stay with my very best friend (Nik Barrett), and having adored the entire island and the ocean around it, I was certainly biased in favor of the book even before I read it. The novel was thoroughly enjoyable, and a real gem of a book. It rates a two-thumbs-up recommendation to anyone who delights in a GOOD book. The last two pages are guaranteed to make you smile. Thanks to Nik, I am fortunate enough to be one of the very few Americans who could read the book, and actually SEE the island in my mind. For those of you with the wherewithall (is that a real word?) to visit Guernsey, be sure to stay at least a week. Take the boat across to Herm, and walk around the island. Visit as many of the lovely Guernsey bays as you can. Eat ormers and smoked fresh mackeral. Go fishing! Watch the incredible tidal \\"outfalls\\" in the open ocean, and see the tide rise and fall in the harbour at St. Peter Port.<br />If you can't go to Guernsey, at least look for pictures of it on the Internet as you read the book...it will come alive for you.<br />Very good book, wonderful island!
B000W9DSVW|5.0|Great package of all the Ocean movies. Awesome set of movies, a definite must have for fans.

B000GW8VTO|4.0|This movie drives it home very strongly how futile and painful war is. Hundreds of men sent to their deaths for no good reason, maybe that would have been a better name for this movie, \\"For No Good Reason\\".  A very moving war story shown partly from both sides about the tragedy and suffering involved when 2 armies decide to take each other on, no holds barred, in a full frontal assault.  Mel Gibson is true to form, a powerful and strong epic from a master actor and producer, he has been involved in many great movies over the last 25 years,and deserves full credit for yet another commanding performance, despite a few fopar's off screen, he really is a legend of the modern movie era.
0670020745|5.0|I cannot say enough about how much I got out of this book.  The list in the back for supporting someone with a brain injury or illness is worth the cost of the book, let alone Ms. Taylor's story and the great insights about how our brains function in and out of illness.  I have purchased copies for others and recommended it to just about everyone I could.  Not long after I read the book (a quick read with great information), a friend had brain surgery; I had a great deal more understanding for her issues because I had read this book.  Jill Bolte Taylor is a gift.
B00192KCQ0|5.0|I have been a metallica fan for 15 years now. Yes, it was the Black album the first metallica experience in my life, however, my favourite album is Justice. Why this introduction? Because I think this is an album that sounds a lot like Justice. Believe, this is the best album since Justice, although I dont think this is the best Metallica album, but it´s a good restart for the guys. To me, this album has some parts that even remind me of the Loads and St. Anger (which I don´t consider bad albums). I´m not gonna say anything about the sound issues, to me, this album sounds ok. \\"That was just your life\\" reminds me a lot of \\"Blackened\\", a perfect way to begin an album. My least favourite song is BB&S, which is not a bad song, but it sounds repetitive to me. \\"The Unforgiven III\\" has nothing to do with the previous 2. \\"My apocalypse\\" sounds like a new \\"Dyers Eve\\". Overall, this is a very good album, which I think we never could have gotten, if it wasn´t for the Loads and St. Anger. This is a most have for all Metallica listeners, this is a real Metal Album, from the Band that set the standards of Metal. Long Live Metallica.
B0012QTA8O|3.0|Quick summary: Get if for portability and because it's Crowley/Harris. DON'T get it for faithful reproduction.<br /><br />I am new to Tarot so I can't speak to the validity of the Crowley interpretation of the Qaballah or anything of the sort.<br /><br />I just got this deck as I found my girlfriend's large deck to be absolutely gorgeous. It's really about the art for me. Thing is, her deck is about 20 years old and is showing its age. Small bits of the cards are almost worn down to the bare paper, edges are a bit tattered, etc. I simply wanted to see these cards in their vibrant virgin splendor.<br /><br />I have to say that I am VERY disappointed with the print quality. My girlfriend's 20 year-old deck's colors are richer, more saturated and have more depth and the colors just seem more accurate. These cards, printed in China, look like overexposed photographs. As if the printers are being stingy with the ink. Colors are light and tiny stars in the background can be difficult or impossible to see versus the old deck.<br /><br />As I understand, the Crowley/Harris deck is THE deck to get. And I WILL attest to it having gorgeous art. It is the print quality that keeps me from giving this otherwise fantastic set of cards 5 stars.
B001DDBCUU|5.0|Why are men who were not fans and got \\"dragged\\" to see the movie by their wives even reviewing it.  \\"I'm too macho for these types of movies!\\" Give me a break!    Now for those who are really interested, this movie does not let the fans down and it is one of the best movies I've seen this year.  I can't wait to add it to my collection.  My girlfriends and I laughed and cried and everything in between.  It tugs at your emotions!  Wow.  I saw it 3 times, and still want more!

0385340990|5.0|Wonderful insight into what we didn't know about the nazi invasion of the channel islands.  This book is a compilation of letters between a writer and those citizens of Guernsey discussing their travails under nazi occupations.  It sounds dire ..but isn't at all.  I laughed out loud many times at the eccentric but loveable antics of the Guernsey people, their bravery under such awful circumstances made me proud to have been born a Brit!!
031606792X|1.0|What was she thinking?? I love the first 3 books but this was a complete departure from the series. The characters are hardly recognizable. The whole child thing was just weird. The birthing scene was disgusting. Bella's obsession with Edward is just that: an obsession, nothing more. There is absolutely no personal responsibility in this book unlike the previous three. Everyone gets what they want no matter the cost to anyone else. What sort of message does that send to her young readers?? In the previous books, part of what made Bella endearing (because she is pretty selfish) was her concern for her friends and family. Where is that in this book?? We cannot live our lives only for our friends and family, but we have a responsibility to those that love us. This book is tragic in so many ways.
0142402753|5.0|Julia Donaldson writes incredibly engaging books for children with a lovely line in humour for adults. The illustrator, Axel, is my favourite illustrator for her works, he seems to bring a quirky but rich naivety to her lovely stories. And this is a lovely story.    It is of a giant who is the worst dressed in town so he goes to buy himself some spiffy clothes. As he leaves town he meets all these people and animals who have nothing - or have been hard done by, he gives them something of his (a tie, a sock and so on) until he is once again down to nothing. He gets his old clothes back and feels down for a while, until he realises all the friends that he has made along the way    A lovely story and a lovely message. The illustrations which seem to be in rich pastel, really draw out the engaging quirkiness of the story.
B000Y179KO|5.0|No, it's not Hotel California...get over it.  It is good music by a great band that's been together over 30years.  Something to enjoy and not necessarily \\"take you back when\\"
0142407542|5.0|This is the gorgeous sequel to Julia Donaldson's amazing and imaginative story, the Gruffalo. If you thought she couldn't top The Gruffalo - then think again. Again, this has been ably illustrated by the amazing Axel Scheffler - whose pictures of the Gruffalo cave and gruffalo toys had my kids in fits of laughter even before the story began.    Again the amazing rhyme and rhythm which Donaldson manages to put into her rhymes really manages to draw children into the story. They are amusing little observances throughout. I must admit, the first time I read this I assumed that the gruffalo child and the mouse, when they finally met, would make friends - but no - the Gruffalo child just wants to eat the  mouse as well! And once again, the mouse is too cunning to let that happen.    Gorgeous book which I am sure your children will love as much as I do. We seem to have a stack of Julia Donaldson and Lauren Child books by our bed which are read over and over as bedtime storys.

B0001FAEBO|1.0|I've had it of describing what the \\"loudness war\\" is. Just Google the expression between quotes and you'll get tens of thousands of results to peruse. So I'm just going to say that this release features the worst type of \\"loudness war\\" mastering, when the audio volume is pushed beyond the CD format specification limits and \\"clipping\\" (loss of parts of the audio) occurs. These comments refer to the mono releases (Snapper's \\"jewel case\\", Repertoire's and all the Japanese releases) - the stereo (Snapper's digipack) release is mastered within the CD's dynamic range, but the mix is very annoying, with vocals on one channel and instruments on the other.
0374280967|5.0|If you need some brightening up at the end of a dull day, then this is the book to pick up. It's deliciously entertaining and great fun and will take you no more than a couple of hours to read.<br /><br />'It was the dogs' fault.' The Queen's corgis, sensing an imposter in their garden, go racing around the terrace barking away at what turns out to be the City of Westminster mobile library. The Queen feels compelled to take out a book, choosing an Ivy Compton-Burnett novel, and from here the Queen's interest in literature begins. Her appetite for books becomes insatiable as she works through many different authors, and as her public duties begin to suffer (in the eyes of her private secretary, Sir Kevin), her equerries, under the instruction of Sir Kevin, conspire to bring her literary quest to an end.<br /><br />Pure unadulterated delight - the perfect booklovers' bedtime companion.
B000002UA2|4.0|This album has some good moments and a lot of smooth numbers with David Gilmours voice and trademark guitar in the background.  However, for me it's not a great Pink Floyd record.  In my opinion the best of the pyscadelic Floyd was on Syd's albums.  He had something unique and his vocals and guitar work were ground breaking.  When Pink Floyd continued on without him they were searching for a while although I DO like the Meddle album,  It's the best 60's Floyd album without Syd Barrett.  Of course after A Saucerful Of Secrets, Pink Floyd revolutionized head music forever with Dark Side Of The Moon.  Not only was it a masterpiece, but it is one of the best selling and popular albums of all time!  And it was a group effort!  Pink Floyd really found themselves with a little help from Alan Parsons.  Than came Wish You Were Here (my personal favorite), Animals, and The Wall.  Now the way Syd lead the band in the beginning, Roger Waters took over and lead them throughout the mid 70's and early 80's.  Who would have thought he was even capable of such song writing and compositions?  And with David Gilmours smooth vocals and lead guitar work, they were a band for the ages.  But A Saucerful Of Secrets was still in their experimental period.  It is very interesting to hear this album in comparison with what was to come.  You can hear the potential that was just about to be reached.  A Saucerful Of Secrets has much more of a60's sound and feel to it and more laid back.  It did not take chances with it's sound the way they would do with Dark Side.  You wonder how did they ever come up with such an album in 1972?  They were sitting in a gold mind in their heads with those ideas and musical concepts.  Rarely does it all come together the way it did with that album and the albums that came after.  They all sell right up there with The Beatles best selling albums and as the best catalogue albums in history!
0345440757|3.0|The book was in great condition.  But the delivery time was not as prompt as I hoped.
B000000WA4|4.0|Okay, I doubt much of a review is needed.  Who hasn't heard at least a few of the tracks on this album by now?  I love this album, it gets regular rotation on my stereo and probably will continue to for quite some time.  I only rate it at 4 stars because one disc is clearly better than the other.  The first disc of this concept album is absolutely brilliant, it has a little of everything and by itself would've been at least a 5 million sold album.  There are only 4 or 5 tracks I like on the 2nd disc which makes it harder to get through, a lot of the slower ballad type songs are on it and that's not the Pumpkins at their best.      But the album is worth buying for the 1st disc by itself and the fact that songs like \\"1979\\" and \\"Thru The Eyes of Ruby\\" are on disc 2 is just a greatly added bonus in my opinion.  I don't think this is the best Pumpkins album, I'm still partial to Gish myself, but this album reveals a band in better harmony than their previous 2 efforts, even if Billy played all the guitar and bass himself.      Side note:  Jimmy Chamberlin on the drums is a joy to listen to throughout this album, drug addict or not, the man plays with passion and it's great to hear.  Buy the album!
0385340990|4.0|I dove into \\"The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society\\" without knowing much about it.  I was pleasantly surprised to be drawn in by the correspondence between an English writer, Juliet Ashton, and her growing group of friends on Guernsey, the Channel Island that is just coming out of five years of Nazi occupation.  It seems that the little island has been all but forgotten, even by the English themselves.<br /><br />The entire book is written in the form of correspondence between Juliet, her editor, her best friend, and of course her friends on Guernsey.  In the beginning she is soliciting their stories of reading and the war for a possible article, but she eventually becomes deeply connected to them an decides to visit.  This it the first epistolary novel I have read, and the form has its limitations.  It works for the first half of the novel, when Juliet is writing letters to Guernsey.  However, the letter reporting became dissatisfyingly oblique when Juliet travels to Guernsey and we only hear about the trip through her letters to her editor and his sister, her best friend.  As Juliet's Guernsey relationships deepen, we don't really get to share in that experience, especially as her friend Dawsey moves to the sidelines for a while and we can only read between the lines for many, many months as the story stalls in a tangle of misunderstandings.<br /><br />The crew on Guernsey is as idiosyncratic and whimsical as you can imagine, the kind of colorful characters who sound wonderful in a book, but who would seem awfully strange in real life. Their anchor, Elizabeth, had been sent to prison by the Nazis before Juliet knew them, but her presence remains strong on Guernsey.  Overall, the story holds together to form a sometimes sentimental, sometimes heart-wrenching, page-turning read.
B0017ZB8M6|4.0|This is surprisingly good.  There is something about Katy Perry's voice that draws you in.  She's not a great singer, but she is interesting and engaging.  There is freshness and energy in her songs.  Also check out Charlotte Sometimes.
0143038419|4.0|If you are interested in visiting any of the three countries Elizabeth wrote about, Italy, India and Indonesia, then read this book. She does a great job of describing the day-to-day live of the individuals in these countries. In some cases you will laugh out loud. Elizabeth's writing style is very conversational like she is talking to a friend. She is also very funny
0316067601|5.0|What an awesome read Lone Survivor was!!  I just finished it last night and have nothing but praise for Marcus Luttrell and the rest of his SEAL team.  The book is just so powerful in its content about how SEALS are trained and put into dangerous situations.  God, obviously, wasn't finished with Marcus yet since his gun kept reappearing just when he needed it.  I loved his descriptions of the mainstream media and their ideas of \\"fairness\\" to the enemy since it coincides with mine.  Gulab and his village deserve a star in their crowns when they get to heaven for helping Marcus.  I highly recommend this book to anyone who wants to see how our military handles themselves in war.
B0017MO10U|5.0|First of all, my advice would be to completely ignore the negative reviews.  Continuum is a great addition to the Stargate story.    The movie has a very good story line and plenty of action.  It is not \\"dumbed down\\".  By that, I mean it leaves some things up to your imagination and thought process.  The flashbacks in time are kept to a minimum.  The special effects are great without being outrageous as in some movies.    The movie does have a bit more foul language than the rest of the Stargate episodes. Then again, it is kept to a minimum and used only in times of great distress.  It is still suitable for children, though.     I would like to have seen more of Apophis and the rest of the bad guys.  An appearance by Bra'tac as an advisor to Teal'c would have been nice.    At any rate, I think every person that is a true fan of Stargate will enjoy this movie.
B00192KCQ0|4.0|I had all but written off Metallica after the slow drop-off of greatness that started with Load, continued with Re-Load, and ended in a flaming tailspin they called St. Anger.  Then that movie that made them seem like a bunch of cat-fighting fifty-pence tarts and ocd wussies just slammed the lid on their career coffin.  Lar's Dad said it best and it works for the last several years of their career; \\" I would delete that.\\" Man was he right.  Well, after pathetically trying to play follow the leader with the newer bands, and crying over making several million dollars selling artwork, (WTF!! Really!!) They have returned to what made them great, and wrote a fantastic new album. Most songs sound like a perfect mix of Ride The Lightning, Master of Puppets, and the Black album.  The songs are around 6-8 minutes on average, and personally I like every song save for the two slow ones, and the instrumental. ( Instrumentals ain't my bag.)  I won't write  about each song, I merely want to say if the last few albums bummed you out, BUY THIS ONE NOW!!  And return to METAL!!

0743290119|1.0|Every chick lit book has the same sort of format: a 20 to 30 something girl (or girls) with one or more dilema - in her love life, her job, or in her diet, most likely. The only thing that seperates good chick lit from bad one is how well written the story is. We love our chick lit when we can identify with the protagonist, while laughing at the extremes that she reaches in attempting to work out what she needs to work out - which is actually pretty similar to what we have to deal with in our real lives. Originality, of course, is also a must - while avoiding the pitfall of too extreme plot twists (especially towards the end of the book). And let's not forget the lessons the protagonist learns by the end of the book, which make the ending so satisfying (& usually happy) for us.<br /><br />This isn't the case here. All three girls seem to already have a charmed life right in the beginning of the book: they all have good jobs, no money problems, no problems attracting guys (& very eligible guys, at that), they all look more than reasonably well, they all have great friends. So all their problems seem to be small & petty, and don't really require that much whining over. And what's even worse - they all do the most shallow & predictable things in order to get their lives \\"in order\\", and I hadn't felt that any of the, grew or came up with any conclusions after all those trials & experiences they went through...
0316042994|5.0|Brideshead Revisited in one of those masterpieces that your find you love more each time you re-read it. It's funny, sad, serious and poignant. It shows the power and the weakness of religion. Waugh's characters are vivid and his language and imagery is masterful.
0671799320|5.0|Daniel Yergin's well-researched and sourced book provides the oil-based context for much of what happened, happens, and will happen in politics and war.  A must read for those who want to understand the world in which they live.
B000Q66PXE|5.0|This is a great DVD set. Visually stunning and well written. I would recommend this to any adult who enjoys something a little \\"different\\". The acting is fantastic. If you like history you will like ROME. The sexual intonations in this show is quite interesting and can be very intense. Especially in how they treat the slaves. This show is not for the good little christian household.<br />If you shop for these two sets individually (Walmart, Target) you will pay about 79.00 for each, so getting them both at one time for 89.00 was a great deal.

031606792X|1.0|I'm not at all happy with Breaking Dawn.  I had eagerly read Twilight, New Moon, and Eclipse and had enjoyed each one.  However, BD just did not seem to fit into their protocol.  Had this book not been the ending to an exceptional series, it would never even thought of being a best seller.   Yes, I knew that Edward was going to get the girl.  That was made clear early on in the series.  Would Jacob ever go away?  Probably not.  But to end like this?  Ugh!  Left a really bad taste in my mouth.  I'm really sorry I even bought this one.  Wish I had just stopped at Eclipse.
B00192KCQ0|5.0|Wow. Unlike many longtime Metallica fans I'm happy for them to go their own way. Even though that path leads to uneven performance (of albums). Musicians have to follow their muse. Where St. Anger didn't quite live up to most of Metallica's other albums, Death Magnetic is the result of all of their efforts to expand and improve. It's all here. Thrash, Heavy Metal, varied emotion and varied vocals, dynamics. The songs are very good and the energy is lightning in a bottle. Trujillo is a great addition.    I'm tired of all the noise supposed metal heads make about Metallica and I'm tired of reading how Kirk Hammett is only a good guitarist. Sure, you can find a bunch of people who do nothing but play fast scales that might, MIGHT be faster than KH. But, it's just noise. KH is great on this album. It's his best work ever. As always he plays the song (not just the same scales over and over again). And he screams with his guitars. His wah wah work is a revelation. Unforgiven III is phenomonal. Any REAL Metallica fan will want this album. I'm so glad I've got tickets for their next show in San Diego.
B000JK8OYU|5.0|Great seller.  Fast delivery.  Exscellent communication.  One of the best compilations and mixes of Beatles music ever.  When it comes to the Beatles, it doesn't get much better than this.
B00005JPO1|2.0|They try to re create the originality of the REAL Indy Jones movies but fail.  Ford is older and yet he can still take out a group of soldiers like he was 28 again.  A whole truck full of soldiers with AK 47s all miss a car full of the \\"heroes\\" at point blank range.  100+ foot high waterfalls are fallen off of without a scratch on the characters.  Man eating jungle ants that swallow and eat a whole human body within 10 seconds.  I mean the list goes on and on, pure ridiculous nonsense.  The alien factor was kinda cool and the crystal skull mythology was interesting, but overall a movie made for idiots by idiots.

B00004WKII|5.0|This set is great. It has alot of hard to find Jimi, Stuff you may not have heard. I highly recommend it.
B000002I4S|5.0|When I started listening to jazz about 15 years ago, Giant Steps was one of the first albums that I really got into.    I was 18 years old, a freshman in college, and I didn't know anything about chords, scales, modes, time signatures etc.  All I knew was that from the first time I heard Coltrane I knew that this was the greatest soloist that I had ever heard on any instrument.    The amazing thing on this album is that even with the amount of notes that he plays, Coltrane always maintains the melody of the song.  I couldn't disagree more with the people that say this album is not very musical or very listenable.  His solos are all based on the blues and all are melodic and are as a result very accessible even with the speed at which he is running through the notes.    This album is filled with memorable songs.  \\"Syeeda's Song Flute\\" and \\"Spiral\\" are two standouts featuring two of Coltrane's most beautiful melodies , excellent solos and stellar work on the bass by Paul Chambers.    Paul Chambers was one of the best bassists of all time but never seems to be remembered anymore.  \\"Mr. PC\\" is a fine showcase of his skills.    My favorite song is  the ballad, \\"Naima\\".  This one has gone down as ne of the great Jazz standards of its era and for good reason.  It is a beautiful, sublime composition which proved once and for all that Coltrane was alot more than just a technical marvel,he had real soul and emotion to go with his physical skills.    If you are new to Jazz this should definately be one of the first albums you pick up.

B0000029GA|5.0|Nas' Illmatic belongs on any short list of the best albums in hip hop history.  I own alot of old school jazz albums as well and I would put Illmatic along with the works of guys like Miles Davis and John Coltrane.  Those guys created magic with their horns..Nas did it with his lyrics.    I remember when this ablum came out in Spring of 1994.  I was a 20 year old sophomore at UCLA and everybody had been anticipating this album for a long long time.  Nas had already built up a considerable buzz on the streets for his classic verse on Main Source's \\"Live at the BBQ\\" as well as his single \\"Halftime\\" which had been released in 1992.    Remember that this was in the early 1990's..pre internet so it wasn't as easy as it is now to hear up and coming artists. There were only a few mix tapes going around back then..Ron G's were the best...but for the most part all we had heard of Nas were his verse on \\"BBQ\\" and \\"Halftime\\"    The expectations for his solo joint were sky high and the amazing thing was that he blew then out of the water.  This was one of those albums that I loved the first time I played it and I haven't stopped playing it since.    Me and my friends would spend many hours back in college in 1994 puffing and listening to this record.  I had never heard a lyricists who was so smooth yet so complex.  A lyricist who had narrative skills to the point where he could describe every little detail of his environment while in the midst of telling a story.    My favorite tracks at first were \\"NY State of Mind\\" , \\"Life's a Bitch\\" and \\"one Love\\"    Now my favorite tracks are \\"The World is Yours\\", \\"represent\\" and \\"It Ain't Hard to Tell\\"    Out of 10 tracks, 9 are stone cold hip hop classics.    No filler, no skits...just straight up beats and rhymes.  Classic Hip Hop    Oh yeah, and my favorite verse in hip hop    \\"It ain't hard to tell, I excel, then prevail  The mic is contacted, I attract clientele  My mic check is life or death, breathin a sniper's breath  I exhale the yellow smoke of buddha through righteous steps  Deep like The Shinin', sparkle like a diamond  Sneak a uzi on the island in my army jacket linin  Hit the Earth like a comet, invasion  Nas is like the Afrocentric Asian, half-man, half-amazin  Cause in my physical, I can express through song  Delete stress like Motrin, then extend strong  I drank Moet with Medusa, give her shotguns in hell  From the spliff that I lift and inhale, it ain't hard to tell\\"    And Wayne calls himself the \\"greatest rapper alive\\"
0887308589|5.0|When first Dilbert comics started to appear on newspapers I didn't understand them, they were probably only comics I didn't read. After I started to work in IT industry, Dilbert is the only comics I read.     And the book is even better, it's pretty hard to understand these comics without explanation from Scott Adams.    These comics feel so absurd, but even more absurd is how often you can find yourself in Dilbert-like situations in IT industry.
B0014Z4OQG|1.0|I should have read the reviews before watching this.  It would have saved 73 minutes of my life I'll never get back.  That's how long the movie is, with 11 minutes of credits.    The style of the movie is the least of it's problems.  If fact, I liked the style of it.  Seeing things unfold strictly from the video camera's view is interesting, if done well, which this wasn't.    First, nobody running for their life is going to care about filming the action so much that they get all of the important parts of the story.  Add to that the uniqueness of the horror, a monster loose in the city, and the brain would probably turn off and think only of survival.    Second, the actual story was very thin.  One shot after another of people running every which way with the monster around somewhere.  This was really about the gimmick of seeing the action through the character's video camera.    Third, being only 73 minutes long, the inciting moment is about 19 minutes in.  Way too long for nothing to happen.    Fourth, the last thing recorded says that 7 hours have elapsed since the monster appeared, but only about 50 minutes is shown.  Why?  Because showing all 7 hours would be boring.  So it's edited even though it is presented as what is on the tape.    I could go on, and on, and on.    In one of the disc's features the director says that the intent was to give America another iconic monster like Japan's Godzilla, the only other one being King Kong.  What's funny is that the movie isn't really about the monster; it's about the kids with the video camera running around Manhattan!  So he fails to meet his own criteria.    Again, this was one of the worst movies I have ever seen.  A complete waste.

0385340990|5.0|I was intrigued with the concept of letters to move a plot forward and this author utilized it beautifully.<br />A wonderful story about compassion, human nature and the joys of life.<br />As an author, it quickly became apparent to me how valuable and important the written word can be.<br />I only have two regrets.....the story had to end.  I felt like I personally knew the characters and hated to part with them.<br />And I'm very sad that Mary Ann Shaffer is no longer with us to give us more of her superb writing.
B00005K9LN|5.0|\\"British Steel\\" is an important part of Judas Priest's career, because it marked an obvious change in their sound, and even image. Don't get me wrong, though, their '70s output was awesome, with such classics as \\"Stained Class\\", \\"Sin After Sin\\" and \\"Hellbent For Leather\\". But \\"British Steel\\" was the album where Priest put a new spin on their sound. As opposed to the bluesier, more psychedelic/acid-rock sound of their '70s classics, \\"British Steel\\" was a pure metal release, and you can hear this album's influence in such bands as Metallica, Megadeth and Anthrax.  Here's a list of the songs and how I feel about them:  \\"Rapid Fire\\": A fast, chugging riff and a great drum intro kick off this speed-metal masterpiece. Lots of epic, action-based lyrics and some great guitar trade-offs between Glenn Tipton and KK Downing. One of my favorite songs on the album.  \\"Metal Gods\\": More great, heavy riffs, a passionate guitar solo and a great combo of Rob's phenomonal vocals and sci-fi lyrics.  \\"Breaking The Law\\": A legendary riff and sing-a-long chorus, this is a song that broke Judas Priest into the Top 40. Still a classic after repeated listens.  \\"Grinder\\": A slower and heavier song with sleazier, in a good way, lyrics, and another staple of the album.  \\"United\\": An uplifting, shout-a-long anthem, one of the best rock/ metal anthems ever written.  \\"You Don't Have To Be Old To Be Wise\\": An underrated, introspective song.  \\"Living After Midnight\\": A catchy, three-and-a-half minute fist pumper with awesome riffs, verses and an extremely cool guitar solo.  \\"The Rage\\": The complete opposite feel of the last song, this one does contain a cool bassline and some experimental textures. Although this song is one I wouldn't listen to when I'm feeling good, it does show Judas Priest maturing in their songwriting talent.  \\"Steeler\\": An adrenaline-pumping, fast-paced classic with more classic guitar work, singing and lyrics. An excellent way to close the album.    The remastered album also contains \\"Red White and Blue\\", a power ballad that I personally love, though think it's ironic that Judas Priest, a British band, would write a song about American pride. Oh well, no harm done. There's also a live version of \\"Grinder\\".  Overall:  \\"British Steel\\" is an undisputable metal classic that marked an important spot in Judas Priest's history. Some may not like this album as much as others, but all the same, this is one of the best albums in metal. I highly recommend it, as well as the rest of Judas Priest's catalogue, as they are one of my all-time favorite metal bands. Well, that about wraps up this review! Thanks for the time, and peace.
0312427999|5.0|I am very impressed by the thourough research that has  been made and the very rich references to various comments from influential people all around the world.  It is a shocking picture of the Chicago inspired economic theories that has even been supported strongly politically and scientifically from the US government and the Swedish Nobel Prize committee as well. I would particularly advice  Barack Obama from Chicago to highlight this economic philosophy that has caused so much pain and the recent financial crisis in  our world[[ASIN:0312427999 The Shock Doctrine: The Rise of Disaster Capitalism)
0684865130|3.0|Full of sarcasm, ridiculously funny, with wonderful prose interspersed.  I am sure it was unique and shocking for its day but I believe it to be overrated and does not stand the test of time.  He makes use of the dictionary, so keep one handy, and the ranting dialog gets to be too much.  What Heller did was to spawn others to do the same, such as the novel \\"Castle Keep\\", which was better, and the movies Mash and Kelly's Heroes.    The protagonist, and antagonist is a W.W.II bombardier who finds himself at the breaking point.  Along with bombing missions his other mission is to find a way out of the war.  It doesn't help that the Generals keep adding more missions onto the squadron's quota.  We find our way into the hospital quite often through this read.  The characters are unordinary, finding any way they can to divert and diverge themselves from the war; we discover entrepreneurs, maniacs, ridicule, capitalists, ineptness........ but rarely normalcy.    Wish you well  Scott
0199206589|3.0|The author clearly knows his subject and provides plenty of interesting details on geopolitical history and the current geopolitical situation, but this book lacks a systematic introductory overview of the topic, which is what one would expect from the subtitle \\"a very short introduction.\\"  In other words, the author has provided an entertaining guided tour of the trees, but has seemingly altogether forgotten to give an overall sense of the forest.  (By the way, this seems to be a growing problem with the VSI series in general.  The publisher and editors appear to be asleep at the wheel, or maybe just in the mode of churning these little books out for a quick profit, now that the brand is established.)<br /><br />Readers already somewhat versed in geopolitics might find this book to be an easy and stimulating read, but I doubt that most other readers will gain much from the book.
031606792X|2.0|The characters were not themselves. The story did not match with New Moon and Eclipse. Stephenie Meyer breaks her own rules by Bella somehow getting pregnant. I'm not going to name everything that was horrible about the book because others have already done it.
B00005JPY0|5.0|Just when it seemed that Marvel was going to take DC out of the picture with Iron Man and the Incredible Hulk (Two very good movies), The Dark Knight blows both of them out of the water. In fact, Iron Man and TDK have been looked at as a new breed of comic book films. No longer do the characters seem extraordinary that we can't believe that they're real. And the best part is that Dark Knight cements this.    Above all I have to say that the film is most notable in its fine acting. Bale continues to prove that he is a virtuoso actor as the dashing Bruce Wayne and the ever brooding Batman. Gyllenhaal also gives a stellar performance that is far superior to her predecessor (Katie Holmes). Aaron Eckhart is both dashing as Harvey Dent and disturbing as Two-Face. And of course I cannot even forget the highlight of the film as its villian, The Joker (The late Heath Ledger). Ledger proves he gave his all and possibly is life to bring this legendary villian to the big screen in a superior performance over Nicholson's previous Joker 9 years ago. It is a guarantee that he should receive an Oscar nod.    To begin with, Batman has grown to be somewhat of a boogeyman to the criminals of Gotham City and has given the citizens of Gotham a new reason to feel relieved. Add a new and successful District Attorney like Dent and the dawn seems to be closer than expected. However, where there is light, there is darkness, which comes in the form of the Joker. The Joker plans to set an example for Gotham and attack not only those who defend Gotham, but the very soul of the city, creating chaos and panic everywhere. After his first confrontation, Bruce realizes the lengths he must go in order to stop men like The Joker and wishes to end the situation before things get out of hand. And knowing he Joker, things will get out of hand.    As said before the film features an all star cast and crew that deserves every award they can get their hands on. The Nolans have made a tight, though lengthy story that gives the audience a sense of true morality throughout Gotham that the previous movies have never shown before. This is top quality writing and directing, which should garner plenty of attention. Once again Hans Zimmer and James Newton Howard have devised a terrific and haunting score that even makes the Joker seem more unnerving. I was impressed by the numerous CGI effects that don't even appear like computer animated images at all and the heavy cinematography and editing. All together this is a great film that has even made history already as the second highest grossing film of all time. There have been assurances on an inevitable third film, which may feature The Riddler, Catwoman, or Bane as the chief villian. Either way I expect great things.
B001ESZNPY|4.0|Much better than Subliminal Verses.  This album is classic Slipknot aggressiveness with a little of Corey's signature singing style thrown in.  Some people like it, some people hate it, but I think it works well on this album and is quite fun to listen to.
B000AGTPUK|5.0|A great movie for all ages.  It's a story of faith and believing, and it is done well.  I actually bought it for my 3 year old grandson.  He loves the movie, and so does his Pop Pop!
0375826726|5.0|First, I have to admit that I got a headstart on this book. A good friend works in publishing and she got me an early copy of the book for my son. I thumbed through it while riding home on the subway, and before I knew it I was so engrossed that I read the whole thing before I gave it to him. I've since read the other two, and let me tell you some things about Brisingr without being a spoiler...    First, I read it in about the same amount of time as [[ASIN:0440238498 Eldest (Inheritance)]]. You may have heard that Brisingr means \\"fire\\" in the language of Alagaesia, and let's just say that has great significance for this book.     The book begins with Eragon, Roran and Saphira on their way to Helgrind. Helgrind is where Katrina is behind held prisoner. At one point, Arya goes looking for Eragon, after sensing that he was in great danger. Let's see...Eragon is reunited with Orik in this book, but I won't tell you under what circumstances as that will give too much away.    I can also say that if you loved book one, you will also love this one. Though the ending might not be described as story book perfect, it is comforting and hopeful and just really great. I can't wait until more people have finished this book so that I can discuss with them!    In the meantime, I'm back to reading run-of-the-mill \\"adult\\" books, though I did bump into (and devour) a couple great ones recently that are worth mentioning, The [[ASIN:0743273265 Emotional Intelligence Quick Book]] and [[ASIN:1416562346 The Impulse Factor: Why Some of Us Play It Safe and Others Risk It All]]
B0019FOC5E|5.0|If you loved the play, you will love the scenery in the movie and Meryl Streep and this CD will keep you singing until the DVD comes out.  This is happy music and you just can't help singing and dancing to the music.  I put it on when I have chores to do and it makes the chores go easier.  We used it while making dinner for 50 people, all the chopping and cutting of veggies and we sang to the music and the chores seemed to go by faster.  My ride to work goes smoother when I play this CD and makes you smile!  I loved it.
B000BYA4JM|5.0|...it's pretty damn funny!  If you go into it thinking your gonna be watching Superbad, you are gonna hate this!  It is a great simple comedy.  I have heard Madonna herself trash the movie and her performance, pretty messed up.  Can you picture anyone else playing that part???  There is so much subtle humor in it that it's easy to see why it was panned.  Also, the action sequences are shot just like an action movie.  Damn good combination.  \\"He's both of Daddy's hands!\\"
B000WCBPBO|5.0|This is a fantastic soundtrack.  I have a degree in music and hear a lot of film soundtracks.  And I have to say that this music is some of the \\"freshest\\" I have heard since John Barry's score to \\"Raise the Titanic.\\"    Highly recommended.
B0010YPTGU|5.0|Thank you to all the other reviewier's commets. They were right. This dvd is a pleasure on the ears and eyes! He sounds so good here. The place where this concert took place is beautiful. It is so perfect (to me) that it starts around sunset. I guarantee you will love this dvd!
B000001GXI|4.0|I've been through two LP sets of this classic along with the DG Originals CD issue. Overall, it is a pretty satisfying recording of the opera. The greatest asset is Wunderlich's Tamino - honeyed of tone and dramatically alive. What an artist he was and what a loss in his early death! Wunderlich is one of those rarities - a suberbly trained singer who sounds absolutely natural here, as Belmonte, in the complex coloratura of the tenor arias of Bach' Christmas Oratorio, and in Mahler's Das Lied von der Erde. Crass is a Sarastro who can sing all the notes and never loses his noble basso cantante. Hotter's Speaker contains a wealth of experience and is much firmer of voice than some of his other work of the same period. The excellence continues with the young James King and Martti Talvela as the Two Armed Men. Friedrich Lenz's excellent Monostatos is often overlooked. (He was also a very fine Pedrillo in the Jochum led Entfuhrung around this time.)    I'm less convinced about Fischer-Dieskau's Papageno. He sings the part well enough, but the vocal acting is pretty hammy. I read an interview with him once in which he confessed that he would never sing the part on stage. At well over six feet in height, he felt he'd present a ridiculous figure.     As to the ladies, I have to echo the reservations expressed elsewhere. Peters, an admirable Susanna, Zerbinetta, and Rosina (wholesale transpositions, ornaments and all) on disc is not a natural Queen of the Night. Her coloratura singing is accurate enough, but it is evident that she's operating at full throttle. She copes with the technical demands pretty well, but she doesn't have much in reserve to devote to characterization with the voice.    I have an enduring affection for Evelyn Lear's Pamina, but I have to admit that her singing isn't very beautiful tonally or spot on in intonation.     The Three Ladies aren't the last word on the matter, but at least they avoid the cutesy-poo antics of the all star trio (Schwarzkopf, Ludwig, Hoffgen)on the rival Klemperer set. Lisa Otto is a good Papagena, if perhaps a little long in the tooth to be a convincing 18 year old. The Three Boys have good voices and blend nicely in their trios.     Lastly, there is the conducting of Karl Bohm. Tempos are sometimes a hair below their flow point. In the essay accompanying the LP set, Bohm explains that there is a certain point in a piece where the natural tempo is evident. Hence, a slower pace than is usual in the chorus ending the first act to allow text to make it's full impact and the slower than normal opening of the second act trio \\"Wie, wie, wie\\" to allow the later patter-like exchanges between the ladies, Tamino, and Papageno to be articulated and understood. Agree or not, the point is Bohm's tempo choices are well considered.     I have a number of flutes, including Christie, Halasz, Karajan, Klemperer, Levine (CD and DVD), Mackerras, Norrington, Ostman,and Solti. None is perfect, but Bohm gets more play time than the others.
B0019IB0II|5.0|This is a beautiful book that teaches you so much about how the brain works. It is wonderful to know that the right side of the brain is joyous and peaceful and that one can tap into that feeling. The author explains in great detail how you might use your right brain more in life, and I've used many of her suggestions. This book also gives you so much compassion for people who are recovering from accidents or illness and having to relearn common behaviors from scratch. It is a very positive and enlightening book- highly recommended!
B0017MO10U|5.0|This movie has it all. Great twists and turns and even though I am not a hardcore Stargate fan, this movie really hit the spot.
B000NDES9S|5.0|It's the Doors, what can I say.  The Morrison mystique lives on.  The music captures a time when things were shaken-up and changed...when war shattered this country and \\"This is the End\\" was a metaphor for Vietnam and a post World War II Norman Rockwell fairy tale.  Say what you will about Morrison's personal life, his music, that of the Doors, has always resonated with me.
B00192KCQ0|1.0|Not sure what I'm going to say here...just kinda goin' with it. The wife is watching \\"Dune\\"...I hate that movie. Anyway...hmmm...yeah...Metallica, 2008. Christ...do we all really still care? Why? Four old dudes who are ruined by success, greed, indulgence, money...you know, we all saw the movie. Music is a miracle...but metal? A bond. Metallica are no longer a metal band-they are a brand...a product...like Coke or Winston. Yet here we are...5 stars!!! 1 star!!! Blah blah blah...I drink a lot. I'm an old man. Metallica/metal fans are by and large worthless anti-social people who struggled/are struggling to get out of High School. The new album? Think about it. Millions of dollars and all the time in the world brought you THIS. THIS...piece of crap. Yet you all PRAISE it!!! \\"Better than the last ONE!!!\\". Really? Better than a mish-mash of Pro-Tools desperation? Wow. Reach for the sky. I don't have time for 77 minutes of Guitar Hero horseS$%t. I don't belong here. I was born too late. Cliff took the spirit of Metallica with him to the grave. I'm glad you can enjoy the crumbs, because I can't. \\"Suicide, I already died\\" indeed. Born dead.

B00005JPUN|2.0|Saw part of it on TV, but didn't have a chance to see the resolution. I was actually interested enough to make a point to see the end. The movie starts out quite promising. Nichole Kidman is really great in this type of role(See also THE OTHERS). Maybe her encounters with Scientologists prepared her well for the role? The film is a little creepy and does succeed in engaging the viewer, or this one anyway. Upon viewing the ending the response it universly received was understandable.<br /><br />But I went in with the lowest of expectations and managed to enjoy most of this arguably (somewhat) decent sci-fi flick marred by a very lame, unsatisfying ending. So, here's to low expectations.<br /><br />But on the other hand I'm always against having low expectations in films. That's what most people do when they say, \\"It's just a movie\\" blah, blah, blah.. And I think we should have standards. Maybe, have low expectations for a film that sucks so you can enjoy it for what it's worth while at the same time freely acknowledging it sucks.
0823023494|4.0|This is a very light book on the subject of using cartoon techniques to inject personality into animated characters.  The author's background in the Disney film animation studio made the book something less than I was looking for. I still found the Disney approach to character creation usefully laid out.  That I was looking for the Pixar or Hayao Miyazaki's approach is irrelevant.  This book is plenty of material for somebody doing light animation stories.
B000MR9D5E|5.0|David Attenborough's narration is much better than Sigourney Weaver's, so make sure if you click the buy button for this much played on TV series that you get the rich, satisfying British voice. Can't top Sir David's style.<br /><br />This gorgeous portrait of our planet Earth leaves all viewers in wonder and awe of our seemingly unique, one of a kind world. The vast topographies of continents and rich plurality of complex life forms are put on crisp display. It's a loving tribute and while your sitting in your home watching the images on your TV screen you might take a moment to appreciate that you were among the last humans to be alive to witness these phenomenon. Maybe it would be great to see them for yourself in the flesh. And it *might* occur to you to help save them, because the planet Earth on display here is not going to last. Stylish documentaries like this may very well serve as records for future generations of what once was -assuming humans survive the damage we've wrought.
B00005JOFQ|1.0|It is with great reluctance that I write this review. I have waiting and soul searching long and hard to find the appopriate words to fit. I anticipated this movie with great enthusiasm as it was heralded as the next best thing since the wheel all over hollywood. When the reviews came in I was pushed even further in my reverie. Then came the nominations, and I was certain this was 'the one.' I was sadly incorrect in my assumption. This picture is well acted and the cinematography is breath taking. However, it is only a reminder that gay people never get a happy ending in hollywood and even has the nerve to go way beyond that. (Tip: If you have not seen this picture stop reading now as I will reveal the ending.) Ang Lee is a very creative director and Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal are both extremely good actors. Let me get that out of the way right now. There is a line in a movie called \\"The Boys In The Band\\" that states 'not all faggots get bumped off at the end of the story.' Unfortunately that is not the case here. Although this is my opinion, the money spent on this disaster could very well have been put to better use. There is no reason whatsoever the lead character has to be brutally murdered in such a violent fasion. Nor was there a reason the scene had to be so long and graphic! There is an entire generation of young people that left the theater or removed this DVD from their home systems thinking this was status quo. That gay people DO always get killed violently, or worse, deserve it. It saddens my heart to think that somewhere a teenager who does not know any better has begun to beleive it! I realize this picture is depicting an era of time where things like this actually did happen. We have, however, come a long way since then and opinions have changed dramatically. We are no longer categorized as sick twisted individuals who must come to a brutal violent ending. There was a simple fix to this: Jakes character could easily have moved to another state and the two men just not see each other anymore. Not in Hollywood dear. It seems the powers that be insisted on the murder, and that is what you are left with. What a tragedy. I lived through the violent years of being gay myself, and am very proud of the struggles and progress we have made. This picture has thrown the gay rights movement back thirty years. The reason I am writing this review is because many people beleive what they read or see or hear. It is with my sincerest hope that this may help someone realize.....it isn't always like it happens in plays or in this case a hollywood movie. There is more to life. I have since thrown out my DVD and the book for fear if I donate it to a library or sell it, it would do more harm than good. Perhaps someday Hollywood will get this right......It just wasn't with this one.nd the two men just not see each other anymore. Not in Hollywood dear.

B0013J9KOO|3.0|This is a strange but good action movie with several sub-plots that kept the movie from becoming boring.    It has a good share of comedy, suspense, and emotion which makes this a well rounded movie, and it is better than the first Hellboy movie.     It is a little tiresome though and some of the CGI effects, ideas, and creatures seem to be borrowed from Men in black, Star wars, and Lord of the rings.    Worth renting or watching.
B000WMEAKC|2.0|I love the CD but wish it would not have arrived to me with a very cracked case, as well as audible scratches on the CD.  There are a few songs that skip due to the scratches.
B00192KCQ0|4.0|Before I say this is better than St. Anger too soon, I'll give this album a different spin on why it is what it is. Most notably Kirk's guitar solos are back, and of course the sound and length of the songs are around the same time table of what they did on In Justice For All. It's good, but is it really epic and great? Well, it's a little of both for the fact that they sound confident and like themselves for the first time since the 1986 - 1992 era. The problem is that that's EXACTLY what Metallica were going for, and they felt they needed (music's Dr. Phil) Rick Rubin to do it. I've read and seen countless interviews with James stating the exact direction they were going for which for me kind of spoiled the surprise a bit since I knew what to expect. However, with all due respect, it's a damn hard thing to keep going in whatever direction you want and remain Iconic in the music scene these days. So I don't hold them and certainly don't blame them for playing it safe and giving the majority of the die hard fans what they want. Metallica made a lot of new fans along the way from 1996 - 2003 when they headed into two different directions, the first being the Load/Reload/Soundgarden/Nu-Metal approach. Then came the I don't know where these guys are headed direction on St. Anger. Now we get a return to form, a look back at an old best friend? I see many are displeased with the sound quality, and the Bass being hidden so to speak, almost like listening to a clock radio. This my friends is called re-authentication. It's like these vintage stained and ripped designer jeans that see in stores that run $70 a pop when yours are 10 years old and look exactly the same. You can't reinvent the wheel, as hard as you may try, it's just not the same thing. That's the only reason I give this just 4 stars. Metallica feels that they need to re-tread so be it, but it's good to hear it as well.
B0017U7PT6|1.0|I ordered this product because of the Aspect Ratio: 1.77:1 written on your description section. This means that this Blu Ray disc displays in full screen without the top and bottom horizontal black bars. To my frustration, this disc is a widescreen version with an Aspect Ratio: 2.35:1. I hate Aspect Ratio: 2.35:1 because it doesn't display full screen. Your product description for this item is misleading. Please be more accurate in your product  description. I really feel as if I wasted my money for an item i dislike in the first place. [[ASIN:B0017U7PT6 10,000 B.C. [Blu-ray]]]. Anyway thanks for updating the product info relating to the aspect ratio.
B000V86OKG|5.0|I thought the first season of Dexter was great but season 2.........It was the most exciting, hair-raising, edge of your seat entertainment!I couldn't wait to start the next disc and see what happens next. It was devilishly twisted and more than worth the money.
B0000025H6|3.0|I can't add much to what I have read here, except that this album falls well short of DSOTM brilliance.  Granted, it is a themed \\"concept\\" album, but that doesn't alter the fact that it is not nearly as musically entertaing and engaging as Dark Side, or even WYWH, to which it can be compared more favorably.  I'm sorry, but I simply found the result of Waters' hijacking the band for his therapy album far less enjoyable than their previous albums.  The one stand-out exception would be, of course, \\"Comfortably Numb,\\" due in large part to David Gilmour's contribution to writing the song and, most of all, his magical, soaring lead guitar solo, which seriously contends as his best recorded solo, better than even \\"Time.\\"  On average though, this album comes up just that:  average (for Pink Floyd).
B00192KCQ0|1.0|Metallica, give it up. I was listening to Sirius Radio and they played a few songs and made a comment about metallica not being the same. If you're a true metallica fan, and were there from the begining you will not buy this cd. Anything post Justice sucks, Anything after the black album is a sell out and it's not Metal anymore. Testament has a new cd out and these guys still rock hard. Rob Trujillo, I love you man, you should have stayed in Suicidal Tendencies, It's not about how much money a band makes, it's all about the passion of the music. I listen to anything from reggea to punk to death metal and I hate anything metallica did after the black album, they suck.
B000065BPB|4.0|First, others have written that these cans are tight on their head.  Well, not so for me.  Perhaps they have not given their cans a chance to break in.    Second, the quality of the sound is great.  I've never had the chance to listen to professional grade cans, so I can not compare the quality to them.  However, as I do appreciate music, I've been satisfied with the HD-280's sound.  Please note, if you are intending on using these mainly for portable devices, you might want to consider something with a smaller driver, as it is very noticable that my HD-280's are underpowered by my ipod.
B0012E6R3W|5.0|I never thought I see the day when I would be writing a review praising Testament over Metallica. I liked Testament back in the days, but I loved Metallica almost as much as Slayer, but Metallica lost it, they sold out, I just received my Testament cd from amazon and I was amazed, these guys still know how to rock, they're not washed up like our boys that can't live up to their name. This is Metal at it's finest, I caught these guys at the Metal Masters tour and I would pay to see them again and again. After hearing some of the new Metallica tracks on Sirius, I would not take \\"Death\\" for free, sorry boys it's time to hang up the gloves. Testaments new cd should be call The formation of Domination instead, cause they dominate with Damnation. I thought after Pantera the only survivors in Metal were Slayer, but Testament has made a believer out of me. They sure practiced what they preached
B000MCH5P4|1.0|The storylines are stupid and the characters are stupid.  What a waste of time.
B00192KCQ0|4.0|I've been listening to Metallica since I was a skateboarding little kid.  I still own their first four albums on vinyl (I'm 35).  I lived and breathed Metallica (in addition to Slayer, Venom, Iron Maiden, etc.) I remember the day I heard that Cliff Burton died, I was crushed.  He was a musician trained on piano and was the driving force behind Metallica, and I didn't know if Metallica could go on.  When I heard \\"...And Justice For All\\", I thought my fears were squashed.  Then I heard the Bob Rock produced \\"Black\\" album, and I was furious. When the grunge age was at it's peak, they released more Bob Rock trash.  My theory to Metallica's down fall was the death of Cliff Burton and the addition of Bob Rock.  I spit blood on those albums today.  Metallica lost there original fans, big time!    When I heard that they dropped Bob Rock and were working with Rick Rubin, I was skeptical.  I was so down on Metallica, I didn't think that the best music producer alive could save them.  Ruben has created,maintained and revived the careers of so many bands (The Cult, Slayer, Beastie Boys, Tom Petty, System Of A Down, Tom Petty, etc, etc, etc.)  I have to say that Rick Ruben may have brought new life to this band.   I won't get into detail about the all the songs, but I'll say that it sounds like the Metallica of old.  It's not \\"Kill 'em All\\", (which is what I wish they'd do), it's more in the \\"...And Justice For All\\" vein.  The songs are long, complex and riff driven.  It's not perfect (some of the transitions are sloppy), but it's damn sure an improvment from the garbage they've been putting out for the past decade or so.  And it's good to hear Kirk Hammett start to shred again.  I've hated them for so long, it's refreshing to like them again.  From a disgruntled Metallica fan, I can honestly say that I recommend this album.  I think Cliff would say the same.
0756404746|1.0|This was simply not a good book.  The main character is ridiculous in virtually every regard.  As noted by other negative reviews, the protagonist is is some sort of fantasy Superman.  He excels at everything.  I can't imagine how a normal person is supposed to connect with this kind of character.  I guess if I were a world-class genius in every field, an Olympic-class athlete in every sport, and a hero of legend I *might* be able to connect.  But, since I'm just a lowly average person, apparently I should simply bow down to the protagonist's godlike qualities.    Meh.      Obviously the fantasy genre is about heroes (although maybe not in The Song of Ice and Fire series, which matches these books in length but far exceeds them in substance), but there's something fundamentally flat about a hero that apparently was *born* with a full slate of heroic abilities and has 100% aptitude in everything.  It seems that in most fantasy novels, the heroes develop into greatness.  They are not just immediately excellent at every single thing they do.      Bad enough that this is the case, even worse that the author demands to remind us of this with almost every flip of the page.  I grew quickly weary of lines like (paraphrasing) \\"He seemed surprised I caught on so quickly.\\"  Or reminding us how the protagonist can learn whole languages in day and half (well, except for idioms . . . because *that* would be silly?), or how he can master in a few days what takes pathetic everybody-else months or years.  Yes, yes, we know that you are very full of yourself, now perhaps you would like to advance the plot a little?    Not only are the characters flat, but to my mind the writing is sloppy.  The author uses terms that feel intrinsically anachronistic.  Many narrative phrases feel out of place.  It's as if the author was cribbing research material from Wikipedia.  The same happens for topics, some of which are shockingly modern considering the apparent era of the fantasy world.    For me, these factors equaled a complete lack of engagement or immersion.  The protagonist is laughable.  He feels more like a 13-year old's fantasy self-image (\\"And I'm fast, and I'm strong, and I'm smarter than everybody, and everyone likes me, and I'm totally awesome . . ..\\").  He is introduced in a ridiculously hackneyed setting that you will recognize if you have ever seen any Steven Siegal movie (\\"Don't mind me, I'm just a humble cook.  Oh, yeah, and just happen a former Special Forces-trained super killer . . . and I'm totally awesome\\").  The book had me constantly scratching my head and thinking \\"Would they have really talked like that, or about that?\\"    Oh, and it was tedious.  This, in part, was because of the lack of engagement, but also because, well, it's just really long.  It's not that I'm opposed to tales of epic length (as I said, I think The Song of Ice and Fire series is fantastic), but I expect authors to make their words tell.  This author does not.  This book is blandly repetitive.      Overall, I simply cannot recommend this book.  If you want epic length with real depth, go with The Song of Fire and Ice series.  If you're looking for something fast, but more engaging and better-written, go with the Farseer series.
B0019X3ZZY|1.0|What a nasty film!  Gratuitous, pointless, self indulgent crap (no pun intended) posing as art.  This is going direct to eBay...
B000002UWP|5.0|I originally had bought this on cassette when it first came out. I listen to the songs now and realize that there are some really great songs here. You have big guitars of Joyride, hotblooded and Souldeep: the pop rock sound of Fading like a flower, Knocking on every door, Physical Fascination, and Things will never be the same; Acoustic ballads of Spending my time, Water colors in the rain, and Perfect day. The voice of singer Marie Fredriksson is in fine form throughout the CD. So if your a fan of their hit songs: \\"The look\\", \\"It must have been love\\", \\"Dressed for success\\" or \\"Listen to your heart\\" then check this out. You won't be disappointed.

B0009R1T7M|5.0|I would like to commend Sufjan Stevens here.  This has to be one of the most creative albums I have ever heard, not only the 50 states project, but the vast scope of music he represents, throwing styles from folk to big band to electronica into the melting pot.  The end result, (Come on Feel The) Illinoise, is a gorgeous banquet of indie/folk that appeals to all with its relaxing vibe.  Illinoise covers, in only 25 or so songs, the state of Illinois and its history.  This includes Mary Todd and Abraham Lincoln, John Wayne Gacy Jr., Superman, The Jazz Age, The Black Hawk War, and yes, of course, Chicago.  If this could sound any more eclectic, you let me know.    The album is lovingly rendered all the way through.  Sufjan comes across as not only a musician but a symphonist, and, personally, I would love to hear him do an album with more orchestral and choral arrangements.  Lyrically he shines as well, especially in the album's high point \\"John Wayne Gacy Jr.\\", where he depicts a brutal serial killer also as a human being.  Other standouts include \\"Chicago\\", \\"Come On Feel The Illinoise!\\", \\"Concerning the UFO Sighting...\\", and \\"Casimir Pulaski Day\\".  It's a tender, poignant, vulnerable, and yet warm listen that never sounds redundant or gets old.  Stevens puts the melody first, and his melodies are unbelievably beautiful.     It may sound pretentious to begin with, but it isn't.  Any guy who is out to make a concept album for each and every state either has megalomania or doesn't know how many states there are.  But after one listen to the chorus and trumpet solo in \\"Chicago\\", the alt/country stylings of \\"Decatur\\", or the soft, almost crying strain of \\"The Predatory Wasp of the Palisades...\\", I would believe that if anyone could make an album for each state, that guy would be Sufjan Stevens.
B00001U0DP|5.0|Fantastic movie, a classic beyond description. The first 10  minutes I was thinking: \\"Crazy italian movie, didn`t I have another film lying here also\\". 20 minutes later I am captivated - the story is touching, deep, but the mood is easy although the rather grave setting of the story.     This is a must-see - above and beyond most other movies made.
B000UBMWG4|5.0|Without question, this is by far the best title available on Blu-Ray.  Just watched it last night on my new 1080P HDTV and it looks and sounds amazing.  For a film this old, I was a little worried how the transfer would be, but all doubts were washed away immediately when the opening scene began.  Very clear picture with incredible detail.  If you have a Blu-Ray player, then this is a must have.

0439023483|4.0|This compelling and entertaining tale invokes the classic 80's film 'Running Man' with a healthy dose of 1984's Big Brother and touch of Lord of the Flies.  Given today's proliferation of sad reality shows concerned with who's the best fast food drive-thru window worker or who can do the best job reupholstering Aunt Sally's couch, this story gives the reader the sensation that Collins is giving us a front-row seat to a REAL reality show where the outcomes actually matter -- in fact, it's a matter of life and death for the teenage 'contestants'.     It took me just a few days to read The Hunger Games.  It was a quick read in part because it is a relatively simple, straightforward story but also because it was engrossing enough to often keep me reading several more chapters at one sitting than I'd planned.  The characters were interestingly portrayed without bogging down in superflous character development, analysis and exposure.  The plot as well as the subplots were compelling and advanced at a good pace.  Just the right amount of detail and a good balance of fast-paced action and slow-downs for getting to know a character.      On the last page of this book it says \\"End of Book 1\\" so I look forward to the coming installments of this series.
B00192KCQ0|4.0|Overall this is a very refreshing album. They finally wised up and dumped Bob \\"Pop\\" Rock for a real producer (Rick Rubin). Hopefully they gave B. Rock a good beating before they let him go - he ruined them as far as being musically relevant is concerned.    Compared to the first four Metallica albums (Kill 'em All through Justice), I give this three stars. Compared to Crap, Re-crap, and St. Stinker, I give it five stars. On its own merit, I gave it the four stars in this review.    Likes:    1) James stopped yodeling while singing. This was getting very annoying.  2) You can tell they finally put some effort back into song writing. Some of the riffs on this album are just down right awesome.  3) It's not overproduced like many of the metal bands today. Seems like many metal bands try to make up for mediocre song writing by making themselves sound huge on the CD.  4) Lots of people are complaining about the sound quality, but I actually like it - a lot. Gives it a very raw feel, which I like.   5) Most of the songs are very aggressive.    Dislikes:    1) Some of the songs have unnecessary complexity in them. It just sounds like they were trying their hardest to make something complex, just to show they could still do it.  2) In my opinion, Kirk's solos sound uninspired and sloppy. I don't blame the guy, he was probably so happy to just have solos in the songs again that he threw them together as fast as he could before Lars changed his mind.  3) Unforgiven III? The first two didn't work, no need to try for a third song of the same name. The music to it is OK, but it immediately raises red flags for anyone just looking at the song list.    ~Slick

I've listened to this about a dozen times and it brings back memories of waiting in line all night for concert tickets in the old days.

B0015RWCVM|4.0|The change I'm referring to is that Abbado, one of the straightest readers of Mozart in the past, has now decided to make it up as he goes along. These five symphonies (29, 33, 35, 38, 41) are all thrice-familiar works, and besides traditional performing style, there is period style, both of which took off from the same fact: Mozart wrote a minimum of expression markings in his scores. Whole movments go by without a tempo change, and bar after bar with no indicaitons except the most basic for dynamics. Mozart leaves everything else up to the conductor. Most don't take this open invitaiton very far, which accounts for a certain sameness from one Mozart recording to the next.<br /><br />Abbado has picked up the glove and inserts expression and new phrasing in every measure. There are susrprise hesitations, stops, surges, and swells all over the map. It's startling to hear this the first time, as if Bach had been turned into Chopin. I don't know quite how to react. Maybe Mozart left those blank spaces because he didn't want anything new or original. On the other hand, originality is a welcome trait in any musician, and for once in the \\"Haffner\\" or \\"Jupiter\\" you can't predict what will happen next. Everything is kept within the bounds of taste, naturally, and the overall feeling from Abbado is spirited elegance, not a sudden thrust into the unknown (look to Harnoncourt and Minkowski for that).<br /><br />The hand-picked Italian orchestra, based in Bologna, represents yet another attempt to raise performance standards after decades of sloppiness among native ensembles. The Orchestra Mozart plays in semi-period style, with little vibrato in the strings but plenty of modern expression -- this sin't sewing-machine Mozart. As the product description informs us, these readings came from live conerts on tour around Italy in 2004-2006. I don't know if Abbado's health was an issue (he cancelled engagements last fall, including a major appearance at Carnegie Hall with the Lucerne Festival Orchestra), but one could wish for a more visceral energy. Sometimes the musicmaking seems a shade prim and breezy.<br /><br />Abbado had never recorded Sym. 33 and 28 before. I wish the \\"Prague\\" and \\"Jupiter\\" both sounded bigger in keeping with their more complex, serious ambitions. But at this bargain price, and given Abbado's new-found enthusiasm, I was happy to hear everything on these two CDs.Festival Orchestra), but one could wish for a more visceral energy.

B00192KCQ0|5.0|Metal masters Metallica's brand new, spanking new, album entitled Death Magnetic is a must own and a return to the band's 1983-93 years.<br />In the 17 years since the release of Metallica's self titled masterpiece  (a/k/a The Black Album), the band (singer/guitarist James Hetfield, drummer Lars Ulrich, lead guitarist Kirk Hammett and former bass player Jason Newsted) along with producer Bob Rock slowly but surely changed Metallica's sound from a great metal band (from 1983-93) into a corporate grunge rock band with the atrocities that were Load and Reload in 1996 and 1997 (I didn't count Live Binge and Purge, Garage Inc and S&M which were all good IMHO) and borderlining nu metal in 2003 with St Anger (which had Kirk Hammett's guitar solos absent). After St Anger, I was convinced Metallica were done (despite the addition of bass player Robert Trujillo, a great player).<br />However, my view changed when I heard Bob Rock was gone as producer and not coming back and the band hired master producer Rick Rubin (famed for his work with Slayer, The Beastie Boys, The Red Hot chili Peppers, AC/DC and Neil Diamond amongst others) and the band were going back to their roots and also standard tuning for the first time since the live 1993 CD/DVD set Live S**t Binge and Purge and Hammett's lead work is back with a vengeance on Death Magnetic.<br />The opening \\"That Was Just Your Life\\" is a great opener which reminds me of classic Metallica album openers like \\"Fight Fire With Fire\\", \\"Battery\\" and \\"Blackened\\". Next is \\"The End of the Line which is another great winner. We follow with another great piece out of \\"Broken, Beaten and Scarred\\". Next is the single \\"The Day That Never Comes\\" which reminds me of \\"Fade to Black\\", \\"Welcome Home (Sanitarium)\\" and \\"One\\" with the quiet first half and the fast paced second half. \\"All Nightmare Long\\" follows and is another great rocker.<br />\\"Cyanide\\" is the second half starter and is another excellent rocker that not would have sounded out of place on the first four albums. \\"The Unforgiven III\\" follows and has horns and strings reminiscent of Ennio Morricone's \\"spaghetti western\\" film score work but is my favorite of the three \\"Unforgiven\\" parts and the guitar work here is excellent. \\"The Judas Kiss\\" is next and is a fast paced number which is superb. \\"Suicide and Redemption\\" follows and is the band's first true instrumental since \\"To Live Is to Die\\" and a great piece of music (hard to top \\"The Call of Ktulu\\" and \\"Orion\\" however). We end with \\"My Apocalypse\\" which is reminiscent to classic album closers like \\"Dyer's Eve\\" and \\"Damage Inc\\".<br />Death Magnetic is IMHO the best Metallica album since And Justice For All and is proof Metallica is not dead yet.<br />HUGELY RECOMMENDED!t four albums. \\"The Unforgiven III\\" follows and has horns and strings reminiscent of Ennio Morricone's \\"spaghetti western\\" film score work but is my favorite of the three \\"Unforgiven\\" parts and the guitar work here is excellent. \\"The Judas Kiss\\" is next and is a fast paced number which is superb. \\"Suicide and Redemption\\" follows and is the band's first true instrumental since \\"To Live Is to Die\\" and a great piece of music (hard to top \\"The Call of Ktulu\\" and \\"Orion\\" however).

B000002H97|5.0|California based metal titans Metallica released their self-titled fifth album better known as \\"The Black Album\\" in August of 1991.<br />By 1991, Metallica(which comprised by then of drummer Lars Ulrich, guitarist/singer James Hetfield, lead guitarist Kirk Hammett and bass player Jason Newsted) were real hard and heavy metal's sledgehammer (along with slayer, Megadeth and Iron Maiden) amidst a hair metal trash and boy band infested world with a myriad of classic albums like Ride the Lightning, Master of Puppets and And Justice For All.<br />After the success of And Justice For All, the band spent all of 1989 on the road and then took a sabbatical in late 1990 and early 1991 to record their now classic contribution to rock and roll history with former Motley Crue and The Cult producer Bob Rock (whom had also recorded albums for Aerosmith and Bon Jovi and would subsequently work with Metallica until 2003's St Anger).<br />Would this album be the album it was cracked up to be or was it what some fans called \\"SELL OUT CITY\\", read on and find out as I did in 1991.<br />We begin the album with the superb rocker \\"Enter Sandman\\" which is now a rock radio staple and the song's lyrics are about a young child who fears falling asleep to avoid the nightmares to come. Today, many baseball relief pitchers (namely Mariano Rivera of The Yankees) use this song as their entrance music to put their opposing teams to sleep to clinch the save. Next is another great rocker out of \\"Sad But True\\" which is slower in tempo but but nice and heavy. Next is one of the album's highlights \\"Holier Than Thou\\" which is a fast rocker, sounds like 1980s Metallica. Hammett's solo scorches here. Next is a song called \\"The Unforgiven\\" which was musically inspired by music heard in the Clint Eastwood spaghetti western movies done by Ennio Morricone. The song is a great song and Kirk's electric guitar work counterpointing James' classical guitar work in the intro and section before the main guitar solo is amazing. Next is \\"Wherever I May Roam\\" which was another great rocker and (like Enter Sandman, Sad But True and The Unforgiven) was a major rock radio smash. \\"Don't Tread on Me\\" closed the first half of the album (cassette versions) and is another great stomping rocker.<br />The second half of the album begins with the great rocker \\"Through the Never\\". Next was Metallica's first true ballad \\"Nothing Else Matters\\". The song featured James singing in a low octave and he does a great lead guitar solo near the end of the track. The song also featured orchestrations by the late Michael Kamen (whom had done orchestrations for bands like Pink Floyd, Queen, Rush and Queensryche among others) which was hauntingly beautiful. That track was also a rock radio smash upon release. Next is the rocker \\"Of Wolf and Man\\" which was a great rocker and lyrically inspired by the movie Wolfen. We slow down the tempo but still rock with \\"The God That Failed\\" which is a great song (and was their first track done a half step down from . Next is \\"My Friend of Misery\\" which is another great rocker. We end with another rocker \\"The Struggle Within\\" which is a killer fast and heavy song with a great solo from Hammett.<br />Metallica's self-titled effort a/k/a The Black Album became the band's best selling album with 14 million copies sold in the US alone to date and was also the band's first studio album to hit #1 in the US where it stayed for four weeks.

B0011ZNAIC|4.0|I did like this movie.  Kind of disappointed, thought it would be funnier.    It was a good effort by Jerry.  Took him all the years between the show going off the air in May 1998 to this films release in November 2007 to have a major release of anything.  I am NOT a fan of Re'nee Zellweger's.  At least you did not have to see her & that horrible hair cut she has had the past couple of years.    Jerry working again with Patrick Warburton (David Puddy).  He has be doing a lot of voice work this decade, notably on \\"Family Guy\\".    Matthew Broderick not quite up to the standards of your big animated voice work, the great 1994 \\"The Lion King\\".  That was a part to be remembered.      Animation is great to look at, colorful.    On the DVD itself.    For such a god looking film, what was the deal with the cheap standard plain silver DVD?  And, it is the type of DVD you have to fast forward, FILM MAKERS ARE HOPING YOU WATCH BUT DO WE?) over the previews at the beginning of the DVD before you can get to the menu.  I hate DVD's like this, such a pain in the neck.  I RARELY watch them unless I am forced to & it does NOT make me go see a iflm or by the DVD of it.
B00005RIKI|5.0|Floridians Lynyrd Skynyrd's debut album Prounounced Leh-Nerd Skin-Nerd was released in August, 1973.<br />The band from Jacksonville, Florida first got together when a tough-looking small man with a larger than life presence and voice named Ronnie Van Zant first met guitarist Gary Rossington and drummer Bob Burns while playing baseball. As fate has it, Van Zant hit a foul ball and KO'd Burns and the two plus Rossington planted the seeds for what became Lynyrd Skynyrd. Shortly thereafter, the trio joined forces with guitarist Allen Collins and bass player Leon Wilkeson. To complete the band was ex-Strawberry Alarm Clock guitarist, California native Ed King and then-roadie and keyboardist, Texan native Billy Powell. Shortly thereafter, Wilkeson quit and King went over to bass guitar and with New York music veteran Al Kooper went in the studio to record their debut.<br />We begin the album with one of the greatest Skynyrd rockers \\"I Ain't the One\\" which just kicks and Allen Collins' solos here remind you of Eric Clapton from his days with Cream. Next is the lengthy and melodic rock masterpiece \\"Tuesday's Gone\\" which was a great song and had a nice piano solo from Powell and guitar solos from Rossington (who screamed the late Paul Kossof of Free). Next is the southern rock classic \\"Gimme Three Steps\\" (which was the first single the band ever released yet tanked upon release and was inspired by a real-life encounter Ronnie had). The first half closer \\"Simple Man\\" is a great introspective ballad, but rocks just like the rest of the album.<br />\\"Things Go On\\" starts the second half off and is a classic bluesy rock number at its best (Powell's honky-tonk piano was excellent, Rossington did a classic bluesy solo and Van Zant sang like a possessed madman). \\"Mississippi Kid\\" is next and is the most country-sounding thing on the album, but it's still a good track with Ed King playing some tasty slide here (the only track he played guitar on). Next is my personal favorite, \\"Poison Whiskey\\". This rocker just smokes (especially Rossington's solo and Powell's piano solo in the middle). The Allman Brothers dld not ever rock out this hard. We close with the legendary 9 minute plus \\"Free Bird\\". Allen Collins had written the music back in 1967 and Ronnie hated for years then one day started singing a melody to it and the rest is history. Allen's riff with Rossington's slide gave the song a haunting call to it and Van Zant's lyrics were superb and then ends with the now classic triple tracked guitar solo of Allen Collins who would play this solo with alot of emotion and energy. MCA Records wanted the band to shorten Free Bird to three minutes, the standard record company single running length, but they refused. This track would become a hit two years later but by then was an FM album rock radio staple.<br />The album barely did get notice upon its 1973 release but over time would become a Multi-Platinum seller.<br />In 2001, a reissued/remastered/revamped version of the album was released! One of them is \\"Mr. Banker\\", a demo which was the B-Side to the Gimme Three Steps single and was a perfect fusion of country and southern rock. The B-Side to the Free Bird single, a little demo called \\"Down South Jukin'\\" (a completed version was issued on 1978's Skynyrd's First...And Last), can also be found here as a bonus cut. This is excellent classic southern rock and killer! Lastly, there are three previously unreleased demos of the Skynyrd classics Tuesday's Gone, Gimme Three Steps, and Free Bird.<br />This album is definitely one of rock's greatest moments and is RECOMMENDED!!!y\\".

0439023483|3.0|In distant or even not so distant future, the United States of America no longer exists. Instead, after some sort of ecological disaster, civilization collapsed and out of the chaos and the battle for survival, rose the nation of Panem, with a Capital and thirteen encircling districts. There was a time of peace and prosperity and then came the \\"Dark Days\\" of rebellion. The rebellion was crushed and the 13th District as well as its residents was obliterated. In the aftermath, thanks to the \\"Treaty of Treason\\" the remaining twelve districts agreed, through a lottery style drawing to surrender a male and a female child between the ages of twelve and eighteen to compete in the annual Hunger Games. A televised spectacle used to punish and remind those who live in the districts their place in the nation of Panem where everything exists to serve and entertain those in the Capital. The 24 contestants, known \\"Tributes\\" are placed in an outdoor arena capable of sustaining any environment those in charge want, while they battle to the death in order to be the sole survivor.<br /><br />Katniss \\"Catnip\\" Everdeen lives in District 12 with her mom and younger sister, Prim. Despite the fact Prim only had one chance to be selected for the annual Hunger Games, she was. That isn't going to work so Katniss volunteers herself in her sister's place. This is an act almost unheard of and guaranteed to draw a high degree of media attention to her. Soon the male, Peeta Mellark, son of a local baker is chosen as her companion representative. After a few heartfelt goodbyes with family and others, 16 year old Katniss and Peeta are traveling on a high speed train from their home somewhere in Appalachia to the distant Capital somewhere in the Rockies to compete. That train trip begins to heavily illustrate the novel's main idea of two societies where desperate want and a daily battle for survival is a fact of life in the districts and opulence and excess is a fact of life for those of the Capital.<br /><br />Post apocalypse novels are nothing new and this one certainly isn't. The 374 page book is a sort of odd combination of the television show \\"Survivor\\" and \\"Lord of The Flies\\" as it touches on themes and concepts handled many times before with better results using far more complex characters. While the author tells a decently engaging story in this first of the series, the work isn't nearly as good as the hype in many reviews. The science fiction angle is very weak and stereotypical as are the characters, the character development, and the plot, not to mention the telegraphed and obviously open ended outcome of the book. Utterly predictable throughout with no subtlety or nuance, this simplistic novel doesn't even have any clever lines that mean one thing to adults and another to teenagers as author Rick Riordan does in his excellent \\" Percy Jackson and the Olympians\\" series.<br /><br />And that is the rub here. For adults, especially those of us who have read quite a lot over the years in the sci-fi genre and elsewhere and have seen all sorts of forms of this in movies and television, this book simply doesn't work at all for all the reasons cited. However, for the audience it is intended for, young adults who may not be interested in or ready for these types of themes handled in complex ways by authors such as Robert Heinlein, Isaac Asimov, Robert C. Clark, Harlan Ellison and many others, the book with its fast pace and plenty of action will work. For the audience it is intended for, who hasn't had the in-depth exposure that many adult readers have had, this novel could work as written. Engaging teenagers in reading is important and this book, while a failure for widely read adults, should work for the actual intended audience.<br /><br />Kevin R.

0316067601|5.0|I enjoyed this book very, very much. For persons interested in either American warfare, history, politics or media it's almost at \\"must read-level\\".     Luttrells history is straight forward, right from the thoughts from his youth, to his anger towards the \\"liberal\\" media and the military rules created by politicians that never has been to war.
0061122416|5.0|This book was recommended to me by a friend.  I really liked this book and since then have become a fan of the author.  This book had a lot of hidden spiritual messages.  make sure you take your time to read this book slowly and appreciate what it offers.
0790731940|3.0|Obviously my tastes are not mainstream, cause I really didn't like this movie.  For the PG rating, I didn't appreciate all the swearing and the slurpy kisses/seduction between Foster and Gibson.  IT had its funny moments, the Indian scenes especially, and an amazing cast of cameos. But it was just too Hollywood for me and the language really got in the way for me.
0739308165|5.0|CDs were in great shape.  I got them within a few days of ordering.
0679745203|5.0|How fortunate I was years ago when the film, The English Patient, was two weeks from release and a friend said, 'Oh, the movie is based on the novel.  I think you'd like it....' I bought the book the next night and stayed up late reading it.  Ondaatje sees the world through a poet's eyes, and he gives us artistic renderings of people and places in a rich time in history.  This novel would definitely be included in my list of Top 20 favorites.  Ondaatje is a writer's writer....
B000UX6THK|5.0|Lynch and Frost really paint a gorgeous portrait of the human condition.  The blackness and the light, and how they almost always are side by side.  The conditions that lead to one's realization that life is either half full or half empty, and the burden and responsiblity of that.  The tiny nuances of human behavior that can only be picked up and interpreted by our subconsious are what give color, shadow, and depth to this portrait.  Lynch is known for delving into his subconsious, trancendental meditatively?, for inspiration and substance, and it is here that he seems somehow able to create what post-plato rational/emperical proofs and structures can never ever touch; the world that is beyond the calculable apparently programmed one we can see and touch.
B001CD6FKI|3.0|When I was a kid, I'd run home from school to catch Speed Racer. As for the movie, I'll admit that I had epileptic fears watching all those color flashes (and I don't even have epilepsy), but the Wachowski brothers have made a masterpiece of a family film.    Come on folks; it's based on a manga, turned TV series then translated into a campy, 1967 cartoon, but it is also one of the early pioneers of America's intro to Japanese anime. I think it's fair to say that too often with \\"children's\\" films, critics are quick to dismantle, dismiss and disrespect the surface of what they see and hear and in doing so, completely overlook the depth of what's really being said.     Speed Racer may not go down on black and white as an award winner or blockbuster, mega hit; but it's what's under the hood that counts.. morals with heart. The way things are going lately, we could all do with some extra morals and there ain't NOTHING wrong with that.
B000Y1ZXUM|4.0|really a very good live programme to watch. seeing it in FULL HD(ya the recording is so)is superb. but the sound quality is not good if u put it in dolby digital mode(sad part is that it does not have dts encoding).stereo mode sounded better. And same thing with the audio cd supplied along with, worst live recording..But if u want to see the lady of your dreams, just buy this.WOW
B00013VHI0|5.0|I really like this band. They create excellent atmospheric rock songs just like Pink Floyd. And they pay tribute to their major influence by lifting passages from the Floyd (on this one they steal the melody from Astronomy Domine and on A Natural Disaster they steal bits from Animals). To me, that's ok because they are paying homage to the masters of this genre. Anathema continue where Floyd left off and they do a fine job of it. Sadly, Rick Wright passed away almost ensuring the Floyd will never get back together again. Anathema is a band to check out if you miss the glory days of Floyd. I'm not saying this band is totally copying. I think they have fused their own sound based on a sum of their influences.
0060760273|4.0|this book has simple language for children in age of 3 and above    my nephew admires this book and keeps holding it every where .    the special thing is that it comes with the bunny so the child can hold the character of the story while you telling the story .    but the bunny is so small ! and the book also , so i advice you to buy a bigger size .

B001FEA9QU|5.0|This is a great departure from Metallica's recent albumns, and returns us to the late 80's.  I just love it.  The CD case itself is also quite interesting.  The coffin shape is actually cut into a booklet, with each page having a slightly smaller coffin shape cut out to give the depth.  Very creative.
0743277465|5.0|In the subtitle of \\"The Art of Learning,\\" Josh Waitzkin aptly describes his book as \\"An Inner Journey to Optimal Performance.\\" It is about his own life's learning processes developed during the mastery of two disciplines. One is intellectual: chess. The other is physical: the martial arts form of Tai Chi Chuan. In the writing of the book, he demonstrates that he is an expert in the process known as \\"mastery learning\\" as well as a highly accomplished storyteller and teacher. You'll notice I've emphasized the word \\"mastery.\\" That is because I want to be very clear. The book is not about accelerated learning or quick tricks for memorization. It won't help you cram for an exam and get an easy \\"A.\\" It is about learning how to learn. About learning at a depth that the learning becomes a part of you. About developing enduring knowledge, skills or expertise. And about using that learning to perform at high levels.    If you want to know how to learn simply anything -- any subject, any skill, this is the book. It reads like a novel and teaches as if it were wired into your brain. It contains the most accessible description of the process of learning from experience I've ever seen, including the need for awareness, intention, attention, noticing details, analyzing, testing assumptions, planning new responses, testing behavior, honing, refining and practice, practice, practice. (Considering that I used to teach Psychology of Learning at the graduate level, I've seen quite a few descriptions of the learning process.)    And like a good novelist would, Waitzkin doesn't just tell -- he shows. You can bet someone has the \\"know-how\\" if he also has the \\"show-how.\\" Moreover, he adds something you would rarely see in a textbook on learning processes: he uses the context of real life and actual experience to show the connection between learning and emotion, how to avoid its pitfalls and how to use it to your advantage. It is a very practical and usable book.    Please note, however, that although I stress how well he weaves his teachings into a story so that you learn them implicitly, he also has a great deal of quite explicit explanation. You don't have to guess what he means. The book could be used as a textbook. It is just more entertaining than a usual textbook.    \\"The Art of Learning\\" belongs on the bookshelves of anyone who wants to learn well and deeply, but most certainly it belongs on the bookshelves of psychologists, educators, trainers, coaches, students and all others who study \\"learning how to learn,\\" right alongside of Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi's various books on \\"flow\\" and George Leonard's \\"Mastery.\\"
B000VLE3IS|4.0|I already have Led Zeppelin's 10 CD box set, but I still wanted a \\"Best of\\" collection for my carousel CD player.  I once had their DVD of \\"Led Zeppelin\\" but that was just too much of the same thing over and over.<br /><br />What made \\"Latter Days\\" so disappointing was that it didn't include the very important Pop charted single of \\"D'yer Mak'r\\".  A good Led Zeppelin collection can't dismiss that important track.  \\"D'yer Mak'r\\" is just as important as \\"Stairway To Heaven.\\"<br /><br />I enjoy listening to Led Zeppelin more than watching them.  I got rid of their double DVD of \\"Led Zeppelin\\" because it bored me silly.  Having this one DVD included in this \\"Mothership\\" collection is tolerable because it doesn't overly repeat so many songs. And watching them live is kinda creepy.  It would make more sense if they called themselves \\"Dogs\\" instead of \\"Led Zeppelin\\".  Plant and Page both look like a couple of dogs on stage.  I'd rather just keep my interest in Led Zeppelin as \\"audio\\", not \\"visual.\\"<br /><br />The packaging of this 3 disc collection sucks beyond belief.  You have to pull up the CD's out of a very tight sleeve and you can only hope that you won't rip the sleeve with your knuckles trying to get the CD's out.  I think I'm just going to keep the CD's in my carousel CD player.  I don't think I'd watch the DVD again anytime soon, so this packaging (along with the DVD) will just end up in my junk drawer for a while.

B00192KCQ0|1.0|Please release this with decent mastering. I can't even bring myself to listen to this piece of @#$*!
B00192KCQ0|5.0|First off, I want to get this out of the way first: Why do a lot of these reviews read that Death Magnetic is not like Master Of Puppets or Ride The Lightning? While they were two of Metallica's greatest albums I predict in the near future Death Masgnetic will be classified as one of their greatest. I am happy DM is not like these two because IMO repitition is a bad thing. While I love that DM sounds similar to AJFA, again, DM stands on its own. And thankfully St. Anguish is a long time memory.    I am happy to say that Meetallica is back out of their long hiatus. Since the Black album, they have been rolling off a cliff until they hit rock bottom with SA. What a bounce back with DM!    DM has no weak tracks, including The Day That Never Comes. Even this radio friendly song rocks toward the end! Kirk Hammett is in top form with this release and every band member, including Rob Trujillo are top notch.    Favorite tracks:  That Was Just Your Life  The Day That never Comes  All Nightmare Long  Cynanide  The Judis Kiss  My Apocalypse    Like the way I started this review:  There will never be another Ride The Lightning  There will never be another Master Of Puppets  AND  There will never be another Death Magnetic. It's that good!
B001GZ6QEC|4.0|The Dark Knight was a good movie, but there are some flaws as I think it has the same problem I felt was there in Spiderman 3...too many Villians. This may be my personal feelings, but I always think one really good villian is plenty. We end up with too much Character Development and not enough Batman & Joker, and really we should have had 2 movies here...one with the Joker and one with Two-Face. We could have had the Joker defeated in this movie and ended it with a cliffhanger of Harvey becoming Two-Face. Then the next movie we could see Two-Face wreck havok. I'm stealing this idea from the great Animated series that developed Harvey and then turned him into 2-Face over time.  So, I don't object to Havey Dent being in the movie, but I didn't think this movie needed him become Two-Face yet...I felt like I did in Spiderman 3 with Venom and Sandman somewhat forced into the same movie (although Dark Knight does a much better job of doing it, as I did not like Spiderman 3)...it was just too much, and Harvey's character was killed off too soon. The Joker is such a strong Character (along w/ Heath Ledger's fantastic Oscar winning performance) we don't need another villian to upstage the Hero. I may be in the minority, but I thought Batman Begins was a slightly better balanced movie as far as character development and Batman action)...this movie has a bit too much Two-Face and not quite enough Batman, but just the right amount of Joker. I'm Nitpicking here I know...So Don't think I didn't like this movie, because I did. I just felt outside of Ledger's outstanding performance its not a 5 star movie. It's a 4 star movie, but Ledger's Joker pushes it to 4 and a half.    As far as the Blu-ray DVD it looks great and sounds fantastic, and I love it when it blows out to 1.85 for the Imax scenes and fills up the entire 16x9 screen.  (If you don't own a 16x9 Widescreen TV then why are you buying Blu-ray?)  I also like the addition of a Digital Copy to put on my Laptop to watch anywhere.  The other \\"extras\\" are a little skipmy for a the amount of things you could have put on a 2nd Blu Ray disk, but I suspect there will be a more spiffy version down the road.  For this reason I can only give the Blu-ray release itself 3.5 stars    That gives it an average of 4 stars...hence the overall rating, but it's the best release we have so far so definitly worth the purchase.
1416914285|2.0|Clare's City of Bones has some interesting ideas---the Shadowhunters' use of runes as a catch-all \\"magic\\" for one---but the overall execution left a bit to be desired.     I spent the whole of the book wishing I could reach the end. Jace Wayland's generic \\"mysterious bad-boy\\" attitude that I'm sure Clare meant for readers to find charming struck me as annoying and \\"cool for the sake of cool.\\" Likewise, Clare's writing of Clary herself--while tolerable--gave off the impression of trying to hard to impress readers, while giving off (at least to me) the opposite effect. Clary's art metaphors/comparisons seemed forced, just as Jace's bravado and \\"humor\\" felt similarly contrived. Trying to be funny and actually being funny are two different things, and sometimes Clare's writing feels like she is forcing the quips and witty repartee, particularly with Simon and Jace.    The characters themselves felt like I had read or seen them before, particularly Jace, Valentine, and Luke, who had hints of Draco Malfoy, Voldemort, and Remus Lupin, respectively. Not necessarily a bad thing---they were in the end characters in their own right---but it was easy to see where Clare might have been pulling her inspiration from. In general, the characters are pastiches of other character tropes seen before.    The \\"plot twists\\" seemed evident from the beginning, and Clare's prose ranges from engaging and action-packed (her imagery in her fighting and magical scenes were well-written), to overly flowery and repetitive (how many times do readers need to be told the color of Jace's hair/eyes?).     In the end, the story had potential and on the whole has very interesting ideas throughout, but I only finished it because I forced myself to, not because it held my interest for nearly 500 pages.
B000MRAAJM|5.0|I just entered the HD world this week and knew Planet Earth needed to be my first Blu-ray DVD.  I read all the complaints that this edition does not have the 110 minutes of addition behind the scenes footage, but since I have never seen it I'm not missing it.  All I can say is that the first disc has been stunning.  Just an amazing picture (52\\" 1080p LCD TV doesn't hurt) and I have been finding it very educational for both myself and my daughter.  The aerial footage of a giant herd of caribou or wild dogs conducting a well-organized hunt, or the detailed close-ups showing every little hair blowing in the breeze, is simply amazing.  Of course I am coming straight from standard definition TV, so part of my awe is probably due to experiencing high definition in the first place.  I would highly recommend this series just based on watching the first disc.  I have three more to go, and expect more of the same.

014303961X|5.0|\\"She saw the clumsy breeches slipping down over the pure, delicate, white loins, the bones showing a little, and the sense of aloneness, of a creature purely alone, overwhelmed her. Perfect, white, solitary nudity of a creature that lives alone, and inwardly alone. And beyond that, a certain beauty of a pure creature. Not the stuff of beauty, not even the body of beauty, but a lambency, the warm, white flame of a single life, revealing itself in contours that one might touch: a body!\\"<br /><br />Oh...my...God!!!  Speechless, stunned, drooling, floored.
0345494768|5.0|Great book for any Star Wars fan.  Even if you're not, you'll find this an interesting look at all the trials and tribulations George Lucas went through to get his vision on the screen.  Even when nobody else saw the potential in it.    Full of alot of great photos as well.  Highly recommended to anyone that has even a remote interest in cinema history.
0345350499|5.0|Have you ever had premonitions of the future?  Been smaller in stature than other people, but able to control them with your mind?  Ever wondered where you got your powers, or why you are different from everyone else?  This book has ALL the answers. Open the mists with your hand and return home to the island of your ancestors...we're waiting!
B000V86OKG|5.0|What a character? Cheeky, Devilish and then some. Have enjoyed the story lines and all of the characters in this series but most of all Dexter. You have to wonder about the mind of the creators to come up with something that could be so real to life..His quirky relationship with his sister is stunning. I am sure she knows his better than he knows himself.Well worth watching.
B000SQJ27I|5.0|I heard this album a few months ago on the inflight entertainment of a long flight I was on. I'd heard most of what else was on display and wanted something new. Well, first thing I decided on listening to it was that I was going to get every other album of his. It is fantastic!<br /><br />Manu Chao is of French/Spanish origin, and sings in both languages, sometimes in English also. His music is generally upbeat, party music with influences of Punk, Ska, and even Polka, and political lyrical undertones. \\"La Radiolina\\" is Italian for small radio.<br /><br />Opening is the rousing Polka tinged \\"13 dias\\". \\"Tristeza Maleza\\" is a bouncy rocker with electronic flourishes and lyrics that mention George Bush (I have a hunch it's not too flattering, but it's sung in Spanish so what do I know). \\"Politik kills\\" is a slower horn sprinkled affair with English lyrics listing the ills of Politics; lies, violence, blood, jeez, this chap must have been around during the last elections here.:-)<br /><br />\\"Rainin' in paradise\\" is a frenetic affair with driving synths, woozy effects and lyrics in English touching on atrocities in various parts of the world; Congo, Jerusalem, Palestine and Baghdad included. Similar in feel is very brief \\"The bleeding clown\\" with English lyrics telling the tale of a sad clown who can no longer get a laugh.<br /><br />\\"Me llaman calle\\" is a beautiful ballad with Spanish guitars tumbling and cascading upon an incredible groove and gentle hand claps. It is one of my favourites. The ballad \\"Mundorev&eacute;s\\" does remind me ever so faintly of \\"Hotel California\\" by The Eagles.<br /><br />Other favourites of mine are the bouncy horn adorned \\"El hoyo\\" with squealing guitars in the background and a slowed Ska break, and the gently lilting Flamenco-ish \\"La Vida T&oacute;mbola\\" with nice mariachi horns and hand claps, it's apparently a tribute to the footballer Maradona.<br /><br />The brief energetic \\"Panik panik\\" utilises siren effects to add to the urgency. I must mention that this song utilizes a similar backing track to \\"Rainin' In Paradize\\", \\"El Kitapena\\", \\"Siberia\\" (sung in English) and \\"Mama Cuchara\\", but each bringing out a different flavour.<br /><br />\\"Piccola Radiolina\\" is a beautiful guitar/horn instrumental. The gentle Cuban sounding \\"A cosa\\" features Chao's first attempt at singing in Italian.<br /><br />If I have one complaint with this album, it's that a lot of the songs are too short, fading away as you're just getting into them. It's nice to see someone can have so much fun while being so serious. Hopefully Manu Chao won't remain just a curiosity to most for much longer.to \\"Rainin' In Paradize\\", \\"El Kitapena\\", \\"Siberia\\" (sung in English) and \\"Mama Cuchara\\", but each bringing out a different flavour.     \\"Piccola Radiolina\\" is a beautiful guitar/horn instrumental.

0385340567|3.0|Lee Child's creation, Jack Reacher, has earned his legions of fans the hard way - through kicking butt and taking names.  He's a surprising combination of loner, warrior, and detective and gifted with a surprising talent for finding trouble.    Thanks to Child's twisted imagination, Reacher has met several diabolical characters in his wanderings.  Indeed, these villains are among the best features of these books.  But the villain in the twelfth Reacher novel just doesn't rise to the usual level.  And this makes for a rather boring Reacher tale.    To be fair, a relatively boring Jack Reacher novel is better than most thrillers.  But we must weigh expectations, and they just aren't met here.    This novel follows the usual plot-line.  The book starts out with a sinister death, Reacher shows up and gets involved in trying to figure out what is going on.  Along the way he breaks some bones and uses his gifted detective's mind to thwart the dastardly villain.  Along the way he drinks a lot of coffee and romances a Reacher Girl - a competent, clean, beautiful, no-nonsense woman who shares Reacher's sense of adventure.    In this book, Reacher wanders into the Colorado towns of Hope and Despair.  Despair is where the action is.  Reacher tries to order a cup of coffee and is set upon by four grown men who want to kick him out of town.  Nobody kicks Jack Reacher out of town - they just don't know it yet.  Reacher tries to figure out what's going on in the company town - owned by an End Times religious fanatic of a businessman.  He does so with the help of Vaughan, a gorgeous cop from Hope who has a dark, painful secret.    What ensues, unfortunately, is a lot of driving around, walking, scaling of walls, and talking.  This has to be one of the least action-filled Reacher novels.  Yes, it tries to be \\"about something\\" by bringing up Iraq, conscientious deserters, and duty, but ultimately the novel fails to satisfy. This book reminds me of when you drive for two hours to yourfavorite restaurant, craving your favorite dish, only to be told they have a new chef and he doesn't get it just right.    Here's hoping the prolific Child returns to form quickly - Reacher is too good a character to waste.
B001E75QGG|1.0|Steven Spielberg in his personal life seems to have found happiness in marriage and the raising of a family. So naturally when he and George Lucas decided to develop a script to end the Indiana Jones series on a happy note, they thought like themselves the movie-going public would want to see Indy get married and have an instant family right?!...groan....groan....nausea...groan.    Does John Wayne get married at the end of The Searchers? Does Alan Ladd decide family life is for him at the end of Shane?    So.... if you want that warm fuzzy family feeling go rent Shrek, It's a wonderful life, and sadly Indy 4. For the rest of us \\"not\\" looking for family entertainment, seek your adventures elsewhere.
B0017MO10U|3.0|After rushing out to buy the \\"Ark of truth\\"  and being bitterly disappointed, this was a nice surprise. It has the familiar feel of the series that we all loved, and was cleverly written. The story keeps you hopping, and promises to be one that we pull off our shelf to watch on a regular basis. The only downside will be upsetting the dust off of the Ark of Truth, sitting next to it....
B00192KCQ0|5.0|I have been a Metallica fan from the beginning.  The only word that I think can describe this album is \\"WOW\\".  Metallica has gone in many different directions through the years, and I think that's why this album is so good.  They have taken elements from all of their past works and put them together into this one.  If you have been a Metallica fan at any time during the years, this album is a MUST HAVE!!!
B00192KCQ0|3.0|It's funny how passionate people are in writing their Amazon.com reviews and ratings.  I notice that the generally panned St. Anger gets an average 3 of 5 stars.  Should have been 1 star.  So it doesn't really surprise me that this one has received an average of 4 of 5.    But let's be honest...this is not a 4 star album.  Yes it is more similar to the heavy, older Metallica style and yes it's by far their best album in a long, long time.  Yes there are guitar solos in this album.  Hey, there was no bigger fan of metallica than I was in junior high and high school.  Things change though and they are way past their glory years.  After listening to this album a few times, it's not bad, but it's far from great.  In fact the only memorable song in my opining is The Day that Never comes.  The songs are just not approaching the quality of their earlier albums on any level.
B0001US8FI|4.0|To reviewer anticlamagus: YOu think wire-fu is better. Thats all you have to say, theres no need to write an entire page to express that,and call  people who doesnt share the same view lunatics.  Bruce written,directed,and choreagraph most of his movies. Which means  all his movies are will be influenced by his own personal beliefs and philosophy.One would probally be his ideal of the ultimate  warrior(very obvious in the game of death, when he had to overcome various and very different styles to reach the top) and most importantly  JKD, which literally translates to method of the straight fist(  because the straight line is the most direct and quickest route from point a to point b). So his movies does not really contain longish types of choeagraph action. If thats what you want, you need to look elsewhere.
0316067601|5.0|This is a wonderful story of dedication, patriotism, and teamwork. It's a story worth reading during this special election time. It tells the story of what Americans can DO for their country, rather than sitting back and ASKING what their country is supposed to do for them. Thank God, there are people like Marcus Luttrell who are bring with them the ingredients necessary to get any task completed. Couple that with outstanding training and the results are going to be good. This book should be required reading before any American goes into a voting booth.
0393061310|4.0|I'd wondered for a long time why certain aspects of history that you learn as facts in school turned out the way they did, e.g. why European diseases basically wiped out Native Americans but not vice-versa. I bought the book because I heard that Jared Diamond answered these types of questions. He does, to an extent. At the very least, he gives convincing arguments for why history turned out the way it did based on the traits of geographic regions. The best part about having read this book is that now I feel like I can open a world map and use it to explain to someone why Eurasia came to dominate the world and not people from somewhere else. The argument is speculation, but it's convincing and sound enough for my satisfaction. In that way, it's exactly what I wanted.    The only problem isn't in the content; it's in the fact that Diamond just didn't write a perfect book around that content, so I'll give him four stars instead of five. If it had been about two-thirds the length, it might have been perfect. Instead, I sometimes got the feeling that Diamond was thinking, \\"I've made a really great point here, and it's done, but if I talked about this example for a few more pages this book would look nice and fat wedged into the shelf at the bookstore.\\" Nevertheless, my questions did get answered, and overall I recommend this to anyone who wants a geographic perspective on historic trends.
B000OCZD60|3.0|Road gangs rule the wastelands in the post-apocalyptic aftermath of civilization's finale. The most valued commodities: oil, gasoline, cars and guns. Mel Gibson stars as the now iconic Mad Max--the quiet wandering scavenger, humankind's mysterious last hero. The plot is simple: The Road Warrior must decide between escape or to stay and defend the peaceful gasoline making tribe from the tyranny of a wasteland gang.    As each action scene is skillfully 'wiped' to the next, the tension builds and the dramatic quality of the theme is rooted. The question is: Can these people escape the wasteland and journey toward the rumored last haven of civilized humankind? Or will they be hunted down, raped and murdered like animals by the whim of gang-rule.    Despite the gruesome action and sometimes campy dialogue, the theme of the film is complex: the right to one's own life. This is portrayed in the conflict between the producer tribe and the thieving gang: the creators vs. the destroyers; and Max walks the the middle line as an individual standing against tyranny, the defender of that right to life (his own), and of that dream of a better place. Max can't escape his past as a policeman, as an arbiter of justice, but can he escape the gang's brutality and live to scavenge another day?    Through Max we identify with the fight against tyranny in defense of a future for humanity, and as we do, a new hero mystique is born: that of the brooding and cunning last remnant of humankind's ideals. Also, a warning rises to the surface of this film; a warning about gang rule and human corruption and where that may lead us.
B00168HARG|5.0|The serie is good. The Blu-ray edition, perfect.     I can't say a lot about the serie itself, except it's a spin off of the well known movie Terminator. If you want to know more, you'll have to see it yourself.    Be careful, though : it can't be compared to the movies, as it's definitely not the same atmosphere than the movies. But the special effects are simply AMAZING, better (if it can be) for me than the last Terminator movie.    The blu ray edition is really good (DD 5.1, no TrueHD though), some extras in HDef, others in Low Def, but definitely a Blu ray you need to have ...

B000IJ79WU|5.0|The script, the acting, Marlon Brando...all combined- cannot even touch the Superman II that was released in America back in the early 80's. After seeing this version of the film, I want a refund for seeing the other one.  You can't even commpare the two.  It's like comparing an Academy Award Winning Film to Sesame Street.  The CEO of Warner Bros. should have been put in jail or fired for releasing that crap and making us pay money to see it.
B00192KCQ0|4.0|Just a few things about this album:    1st off, it's great to hear Kirk soloing again! And it's not a subtle return for him. His solos on here rip...classic Hammett heavy on the Wah pedal... I believe he said once before that soloing can become boring to him, but to listen to this you wouldn't know it. He proves here that he's still got the chops and then some.    2nd, the riffs bring to mind the Puppets/Lightening/Justice era sound...and I can't quite place the lyrics. I hear similarities to the vocal style throughout their entire body of work. Thankfully I don't hear similarities to St. Anger's vocals.    All-in-all I am glad to hear them return with an album that delivers!
0756404746|5.0|This tale begins almost quietly, with just a hint of danger, introducing us to Kote, the innkeeper (who used to be the infamous Kvothe) and his somewhat otherworldly assistant, Bast. Then Chronicler comes and recognizes Kvothe who reluctantly agrees to tell his tell. In this way we learn where Kvothe came from and how he made his way from there to the inn where he now resides. I'm not going to spoil the tale but suffice it to say it is one of the best I have read of late and my only complaint is that I must wait for the next installment. Enjoy.
B000002GGU|5.0|Come on everyone! Bryan Adams has said it himself multiple times (Press & Sun Bulletin 2001, CBS Early Show 2008). 'Summer of 69' is not about 1969 but the act known as 69.  Some radio stations stopped playing it for that reason.

0743290119|1.0|This book is a major departure for Lauren Weisberger-- in that it is terrible to the point of nearly being unreadable. Don't get me wrong-- I don't take my chick lit too seriously. If a book has a pink cover with stilettos on it, there's a slight chance it might have reasonably good writing and character development, but usually the best you can hope for is a cheesy but fun, quick read. This book, however, crosses the threshold from silly to painful. The characters are one-dimensional, stereotypical, and derivative of every other mainstay of chick culture-- she might as well have named Adriana Samantha. Oh, and the way that she defined one of her characters as ethnic-- she made her say \\"querida\\" in every other sentence, because you know, that's how Latinas talk. And by the way, I live in NYC, and it's not too often that you stumble across world famous actors/ directors/ sportscasters/ authors who are just dying to go out with you. Or, for that matter, that you suddenly get movie deals dropped into your lap. I was also annoyed by the title, which as it turns out, applies only vaguely to only one character-- it's almost as if she chose the title because she thought it sounded good and not because it had any huge relevance to the book.     But perhaps what drove me the most crazy was how they kept waxing poetic about how old they are. The characters are all 29 year-olds who turn 30 over the course of the book, and they all act like they're turning 60. In one scene, they're out to dinner celebrating one of their 30th birthdays, and the waitress says something to the effect of \\"I hope I look like you when I'm your age.\\" The characters roll their eyes, saying the waitress couldn't be older than 24, as if that were a zygote in comparison to their many years. Because in the six years between 24 and 30, you go from being a naive cheerleader to being a mature, condescending crone. The book was peppered with phrases like \\"when you get to be our age, you rush into marriage forthe wrong reasons\\" [paraphrased] and it just wore on me after a while. I'm 29 myself, and it just doesn't fit with reality.     If you're so desperately curious and need to read this book, please, do yourself a favor, and visit your local library.
B000089RV6|5.0|Best album by ACDC I loved Bon Scott but Brian Johnson is a one in a million replacement.  Its so rare for lightning to strike twice for a group after a lead singer goes but here it did.  5 stars best of the best!!!!!!

B000002IAZ|5.0|Being 60 I sometimes forget what real,artistic music was. I have come through the years listening to the music scene change and my overview is that creativity,voice(of the people)and talent is or has spiraled downward. The Buffalo Springfield lets us hear what real musical talent accomplishes in song writting and musicianship. They were,along with many others of their generation, the beginning of the greatest musical phase of the century. All we get now are corporate teenage warblers and one beat rap \\"gangsta's\\". The \\"Great Society\\"?
B000QFON98|5.0|Starting off with her most famous work, Rebecca, all three novels in this collection offer Du Maurier's strengths: intrigue; romance; dramatic setting in the English countryside; entrancing writing; and mystery.<br /><br />Do you enjoy great romance writing, strong central characters, and chilling suspense?  Daphne Du Maurier sweeps her readers away from  mundane, everyday worries and into a bygone era of pirates, star-crossed lovers, English manors with their magnificent gardens, and roadhouses by the sea.<br /><br />The biggest problem with the collection is putting the book down and getting some sleep!  Well written, beautifully presented, and a wonderful collection to keep you company during long winter evenings by the fireside.  Enjoy!
B00005JNX0|5.0|I saw the trailers for Madagascar II, started singing \\"I like to move it, move it\\" all over the place and knew I had to rent the original.  I mostly watched it to see the song acted out and wasn't expecting much.  I made my sister watch it with me, my husband being out of town.<br /><br />From the beginning, it seemed pretty clever and involving, but when they got to the island, it really picked up!  King Julian is hilarious!  My sister and I were laughing like loons.  When the movie was over, we watched all the extras, and then over the next few days, we talked and and laughed over our favorite scenes.  When my husband came home, we watched it again with him and laughed even harder and saw things we hadn't seen the first time.  This movie takes multiple watchings to get all the funny parts, because when you're watching the main characters, other, funnier things are happening in the background.  After we watched it with my husband, we went back and played our favorites scenes AGAIN.  Yes, it was THAT funny!  I love this movie and now I have to buy it.<br /><br />I can't wait until Madagascar II comes out.
B000000HXK|5.0|From the moment the piano opens up with The Loom, you are under a spell that you can feel, but cannot express. Lyrics seem to mean nothing, but point into the vastness of everything. Visions of city lights and empty streets haunt this album. It all creates a dream, a spell, a hex for you to explore. Bark Psychosis have tapped into some kind of consciousness that feels both modern and eternal at the same time. I can't do enough to describe this album. Listen to the Loom and imagine the giant weaver putting together the lights in the sky. The lights on the street. Feel how it all fades and moves without effort. You're getting closer. . .
B000F48CD8|5.0|I've had this album for a while now, and it is one of my favorites.  I thought it was going to be similar to the White Stripes, but it really isn't; there are some similarities, but it has more structure and less of the random loud noises that the Stripes use so much lately.  This album has a good mixture of fast-paced songs with a few \\"poppier\\" songs mixed in.  If you're looking for some good, creative, rowdy music, then buy this album!
0441009425|5.0|From the first get-go, Alastair Reynolds propels the reader into an intriguing narrative that somersaults through relativistic space and time.  A first acquaintance with Daniel Sylveste takes place on a remote planet called Resurgam, at the site of a dig.  The scene illumines Sylveste's feverish mission to shed light on how, and why, something wiped the ancient avian species of the Amarantin from the collective memory of the universe.  After a mere chapter, the plot complicates into something that denies interpretation unless the reader devotes their thinking to the relative space and time continuum governing the story as a whole.<br /><br />Several parallel threads drive the timeline forwards into a tangential point where all time and action unites into a joint series of events.  Through these threads, Reynolds describes the procedures leading up to a pivotal event on a galactic scale.<br /><br />Daniel Sylveste, sole heir of the once mighty Sylveste clan, explores the nine hundred thousand years old past of the Amarantin species through explicitly advanced methods, reading the old graphic language of a culture long since forgotten.  What he reveals does not only implicate himself, but his species as a whole.  A danger lurks somewhere in the vastness of space, a danger that can destroy worlds, and Dan commits himself to explore the intricate details around this lurking horror, for better or for worse.<br /><br />Alastair Reynolds explores the fringes of science fiction in a skillful manner that rarely shows itself in what we know as mainstream authorship.  Revelation Space poses a subtle mix of scientific deductions that blend seamlessly with a tale of utter epic proportions into what Locus called the \\"the space opera of 2000.\\"<br /><br />After reading novels like The Eternal Champion and Consider Phlebas, I assumed that I had touched the edges of science fiction, but I could not have been more wrong in that assumption.  Reynolds pushes the envelope one notch further, breaking it down neutrino by neutrino, and restructuring it with surgical precision into a mighty yarn of relativistic dreams.  Revelation Space bound me, inevitably, by the sheer ideas purported through the story lines that unfolded before my inner vision.  The book hooked me from the very first page, and I found it very hard to take a brief pause to contemplate the massive underlying theories that poses as the core of the novel.neutrino, and restructuring it with surgical precision into a mighty yarn of relativistic dreams.

037571457X|5.0|People often associate comic books with childrens' fiction, as if the medium itself is inflexible. Some of us the comic lovers know that is not the case. And case in point Persepolis - where the emotions of a little girl in the politically and socially charged Iran takes us through what would have been a blind journey. I think pictures don't necessarily paint a thousand words, it paints many, and it leaves the number to the reader. While written words force a description on your mind, a picture leaves a lot to your imagination. It lights the spark with the image, and the image takes on its own life in your mind. This is what I felt while reading Persepolis, where just with two shades, Marjane Satrapi gives us enough fodder to ruminate in the visual fields of our imagination. I could see the drastic transformation of one of her neighbours going from a mini-skirt to the veiled burkha.<br /><br />Marjane Satrapi is gifted and trained no doubt, and it shows in the depictions of emotions that are otherwise hard to describe. You may also want to look for books by Dupuy and Berberian, that tell of personable tales in their lives or fictitious characters drawn with similar dexterity.
0446402389|5.0|This book by Tom Rob Smith caught my attention due to the setting and date (1950's Stalinist Russia) but the story hooked me from the very beginning.  Smith has done much research to be able to describe lifestyle (if it can be called that) in Russia at that time.  Leo, the protaganist is a complex character who's internal struggle through the book keeps you wanting to know more.  This is a well written, well researched book that is appealing to readers not only as a satisfying thriller but also due to the fact that you glimpse and see 1950's Russia and the hardship those citizens faced at that time.  It's a story of despair and a story of hopelessness, but that forces the spirit to constantly look for signs hope, for the characters in it as well as the reader.  Pick it up, you won't be disappointed and it's a terrific mystery.
0375826726|4.0|I enjoyed the first two books of this series, and was eager to read the third. I won't outline the plot, because you can find that elsewhere. I will just tell you what I think about this book.<br /><br />It is an enjoyable read, and a worthy third installment to the series. I thought that Eragon was a very good story, and Eldest not quite as good, although Paolini's writing had improved. Brisingr is the best of the three. I fell back into the story right away, and I found myself caring about the characters, even worrying about their safety. This is what I look for in fiction: it made me want to pick up the book every chance I got. If it interferes with the rest of my life, it is a very good book. Brisingr is one of those books. I am thankful to my son that he recommended this series to me.<br /><br />Some reviewers of Eldest were very critical of the fact that the plot is derivative of other epics, like The Lord Of The Rings or Star Wars. I didn't mind this in the least. It is the tale of a hero's journey, complete with absence, devestation and return. It is one of the oldest tales in storytelling. We already know the story, but it is the storytelling that makes it good or bad. Paolini is a good writer. Not as great as Tolkein or LeGuin, but good nevertheless. I was able to suspend my inner critic, and enjoy the read. I recommend that you do the same.
B00002DEGZ|2.0|On these recordings we have a \\"copy\\" of a primitive fortepiano recorded at a considerable distance. It sounds like someone backstage is plucking rubber bands.     Can this be how Mozart expected to make his name and fame, playing a toy piano way off in the background somewhere? \\"Authentic\\", my ---.     Later fortepianos (e.g. the Grafs from the 1820's) developed some tone and volume, but even these cannot hold their own against a full orchestra.     If you are looking for a recording of the complete concerti, the recordings Geza Anda made with the Salzburg Mozarteum are still available and are very fine indeed.
9626344679|5.0|I became a Jane Austen fan as an adult, never having been required to read her as a student.  I'm glad, because I have been able to enjoy her works thoroughly without having to take examinations on them.<br /><br />Although I delight in all the books, my favorite might well be MANSFIELD PARK - the one many other Austen fans love to hate.  Yes, Fanny Price is an unlikely heroine.  Heroines should be spunky, outspoken, captivating, and confident (though not perfect).  Fanny is timid, nervous, self-effacing, unambitious, and well nigh invisible!  One might think the heroine really ought to be Mary Crawford, or even Maria Rushworth; they're the ones with all the qualities.  Yet they fall short.  What does Fanny have that they haven't?  That's the point.<br /><br />Human society is a complicated thing, and many factors make a person think, act, and believe the way he or she does.  It is said of Fanny's situation from the beginning that \\"nobody meant to be unkind, but nobody put themselves out of their way to secure her comfort.\\"  Perhaps precisely because Fanny is not considered highly - because she is given little attention (except from Edmund) and isn't pressured or persuaded into self-importance and desire for \\"success\\" - she is able to be a moral compass for those around her, although not in a repugnant way.  Her uncle, Sir Thomas, is hampered by aristocratic tradition; the neighbors, Mary and Henry Crawford, bring with them all the charm, ambition, and moral ambiguity of cosmopolitan values; three of her cousins, trained up for social success by their family status and (in the cases of Maria and Julia) the efforts of their self-serving aunt, are captured by the same sophisticated glitter.  Even Edmund, whose sincere desire for a career in the church cuts him out of fashionable living, is misled by the sparkle and shine.  Fanny sees things clearly, and though she hasn't the confidence to promote herself or persuade the others, she has the trembling courage not to bend.<br /><br />The characters may not be painted in the colors some readers would like, but they're painted well, with lovely shadings and subtleties.  I enjoy Miss Austen's mature writing - the tale flows and the humor in the telling is delightfully subtle and sharp.<br /><br />I also love Juliet Stevenson's performance of this unabridged audio book.  She gives wonderful characterizations, from the timid Fanny to the stable but love-struck Edmund to the nearly-wicked Mrs. Norris.  The production is done very well and, if you already enjoy MANSFIELD PARK and intend to listen to it quite a few times, is worth the cost.

B0017MO10U|3.0|I like Stargate SG-1 but can't really take it too seriously. I view it as a sort of candy I guess. But it's fine for what it is.   I think with \\"Continuum\\" they tried a little too hard to do something different. The idea was interesting, but the old time travel thing used so often in sci-fi was a little too stale here. Plus it seems to have detracted from what makes the show work: the characters. While some characters stayed themselves, others changed and were marginalized (Vala and Teal'c for example). Obviously when a series and contracts end it's hard to get all the actors back for a new project at the same time, but I think they could have kept the \\"team\\" dynamic that made Stargate work. Ark of Truth was better in my opinion.
B000002GOZ|5.0|1st things 1st..In the Past MTV Uplugged has brought in the best musicians and combined them with there own flavor..Bryan Adams has proved himself as a creative musician by putting a new kick to his songs.

The other songs were from his other cd's..There was one song that I can remember that he wrote specificly for unplugged and that was \\"I'm Ready\\"..what a song..so even if your not a bryan adams fan..but a mtv Unplugged fan..I say get this on DVD and CD..the instrumental are terrific..so i hope u all like my review
B000002GBJ|4.0|If you've heard Yes, you'll know that Rick Wakeman has a great way with sonic textures, and he puts it to good use on his 1973 solo album \\"The Six Wives of Henry VIII\\". There's lonely flute at the end of Catherine Howard, for instance, that reflects her sad end. There's alarming opening whirl of keys at the beginning of Anne of Cleves and the turbulence that follows is almost like the turbulence that Anne must have felt, having been taken from her country to marry Henry. The church organ and spine tingling synth of \\"Jane Seymour\\" give the sense that there is something monumental happening, and there was, Jane Seymour was the mother of Henry's son Edward, future king of England.    The album wouldn't be the same without the selection of guest musicians, particularly the drummers Alan White and Bill Bruford, both from Yes. A couple of other members of Yes (Steve Howe and Chris Squire), make an appearance too, on \\"Catherine of Aragon\\". The five vocalists (who basically \\"ooh\\" and \\"ah\\") give the tracks they sing on a character that you'd only find on a Rick Wakeman record.    I prefer \\"Journey to the Centre of the Earth\\", but \\"The Six Wives of Henry VIII\\" is definitely a worthwhile experience for fans of the keyboard and of instrumentals.    (The CD booklet is a short, fold-out affair, but does have a list of who-plays-what, as well as a small profile for each of Henry's six wives.)
B00005BKZJ|5.0|A zaftig German tourist has a major tiff with her boorish husband in the middle of the desert outside Las Vegas, yanks a suitcase out of the car and stomps off for points unknown. Her husband, perhaps to make a point, drives off without looking back.<br /><br />Several hours later, the wife (Marianne Sagebrecht) arrives dusty and dishevelled at the only populated spot on the horizon, the run-down, lethargic Bagdad Oil and Gas and Cafe, run by a cranky woman named Brenda(the incomparable CCH Pounder). Brenda has just driven her husband away with her hystrionics, but her disposition seems earned; she is riding herd on a failing business, assisted only by a less-than-inspired cook, while trying to keep track of a free-spirit teenage daughter who cavalierly rides off with motorcyclists and truck drivers for days at a time. Brenda also is plagued by a son whose only interest in life is playing etudes and fugues on the piano; there is also the matter of his infant son, who is never explained (Brenda's son seems far too young to be responsible for an infant, but there it is, and no mother in sight). It all makes Brenda more than a little cranky. And when a strange, foreign lady in odd clothing appears at the door wanting a room at the adjoining motel, her patience is sorely tried.<br /><br />The German tourist, Jasmin, comes to the Cafe because it is the only thing in sight. She asks for a room in the motel, while musing privately about the state of uncleanliness throughout the business, and views the other denizens of the motel with a guarded eye. Rudi Coxx (Jack Palance, in a stellar turn), an ex-set painter from Hollywood, dresses outlandishly and lives, apparently, in a small travel trailer on the property. Debby, who lives in the motel, carries on a highly successful ad hoc tattoo business; truck drivers literally launch themselves from their rigs and race to her room. (You might get the wrong idea of the nature of her work from their initial enthusiasm, but her calling is made clear very early on.)<br /><br />Jasmin quietly makes herself indispensible to Brenda, after Brenda's initial suspicions; she is won over by Jasmin's gentle nature and willingness to aid Brenda in whatever way necessary. Jasmin wins the hearts of Brenda's teenage children also, and she quickly becomes part of the oddball family of misfits.<br /><br />This movie is an unqualified joy. Nothing momentous happens here, unless you count Jasmin's unifying of the oddities into a working unit; it is simply a sweet, surreal two hours in which to lose oneself. All the acting is first-rate; Marianne Sagebrecht made a few appearances in American movies, probably on the strength of her role here, and does a fine job as the sweet but determined Jasmin. Jack Palance performs so admirably that he should have been nominated for Best Supporting, although the role was a blip on the radar amongst the big-budget movies of that year. And CCH Pounder transforms wonderfully from the frenetic, wired, bad-tempered harridan of the first fifteen minutes of the movie to the accepting and content cafe manager of later in the film.<br /><br />I saw this movie a few years after it came out, and was instantly hooked. At some point I hope they come down a bit on the price, but at least it's finally in DVD; for a long time I could not find it in that format. It is well deserving of being on the shelf of any serious film buff; a gentle, honest treatment of the power of positive tninking and good will. Highly recommended.very early on.)

B00001U0E1|5.0|Writing a play is a tiresome burden when you don't have the faintest idea what it is going to be about but you need to hand it over real soon. Fortunately, Will Shakespeare finds his muse and the authors of the screenplay also had at least a brief encounter with theirs.<br />Basically a romantic comedy SIL offers much more that the standard \\"boy meets girl, boy loses girl\\" scenario - they present it in a fantastically well rendered setting taking as much as they could from the Swan of the Avon.<br />A perfect way to spend an afternoon - you get your share of romance, adventure, and literary history (the latter should not be taken at face value, however). Do you need more?

0307269752|5.0|I just loved this book. It is the most hyped mystery of the fall season. For once the hype is well deserved. Once I got started reading I didn't want to stop. When I got near the end I wanted to slow down to make it last but I couldn't. I don't want to spoil any of the plot but anyone who likes mysteries will love this book. I was actually somewhat depressed when I finished because I did not want the book to end. But when I checked the author's website I found out that the next book - The Girl Who Played with Fire will be published on January 9,2009 and I will order it and start the next one as soon as I get the book. Such a shame the author died.
031606792X|5.0|I thought this book was written very well, with intense drama all the way to the very last page. Stephanie Meyer did a great job finalizing her series. To any potential readers out there afraid to get into the series because of the mixed reviews of this last book - don't hesitate for a second to start. It is a enjoyable, page turning book and really equals if not surpasses some of the other books included in the Twilight Series. Unless you thrive on miserable, unhappy, dark, and sad conclusions to stories - then perhaps this isn't for you.

It has a strong story line emphasizing family ties and following your dreams.  I really hope they make a sequel.

B00192KCQ0|5.0|As a musician I am proud of the work Metallica has put into Death Magnetic! For a long time prior to this album I never completely understood why Metallica risked losing so many fans over the Napster ordeal - but even so they still care about their fans because this album is exactly what many fans have been asking for - for Papa Het and his bandmates to get back to their roots. I think with the Napster ordeal too many people thought Metallica was getting greedy and exploiting their fans, but what it really was about was an unreleased song that leaked onto Napster with different versions - and Metallica didn't want all those unreleased versions to get out there and misrepresent what they were trying to accomplish. At their age (although not as old as Aerosmith, for example) with them pumping out these tunes, they show that they still got it! 5 stars all the way!!
0385334206|1.0|This book holds a very special place in my heart. It is the first book I ever threw away.     It hasn't been the last.      Back in 1976 I spent every Saturday at the local bookstore, and one day thought I would venture far from the Sci-Fi and Mystery shelves over to the BESTSELLERS! I would buy one, I thought, and take it home and expand my view. I saw this book, priced at the then unheard of price of $[...](you could get two paperbacks for that price back then), but I gulped and paid and sped home.     Five minutes into reading I got that sickening feeling you get when you find out you've thrown your money away and you'll never get it back. Five minutes more only increased the sickness. I could stomach no more. I put it down. But I had a plan.     I took it to Junior High the next day, and walking through the courtyard I took it from my backpack and spun it into the trash. I was immediately cleansed, and though I knew I would never get my money back I felt a rush of joy and lightness at having rid the world of such utter crap.     Two good thing came of that event. Before, I treated and thought of books as sacred things. I did no longer. Books are not sacred. Good writing surely is. The second thing that happened is I never read another Vonnegut book. I put more effort into toilet paper than was put into that garbage. Having been treated so cavalierly by V-gut I determined not to be taken in again. No author deserves a second chance if the first contained so little effort. He spits in the face of the reader with this book with an attitude of: You'll read whatever I write because of who I am.     Un-so. As a P.S., I opened a copy of B of Crap in the library some 20 years later to see if possibly I had been too immature in my Jr. High days and perhaps something of worth could be found within the pages. With pride at the profound insight of that young boy, I closed the book minutes later and put it back, assured that my first assessment had been correct. A piece of crap. Thank you, K.V., for teaching me the difference between good writing and resting on undeserved reputation.
031606792X|5.0|This book, as well as the other 3 in this series are utterly amazing. I am an avid reader and am always looking for a good book. Once I started reading this, I could not put it down. I read all 4 of these books in 2 weeks! The story touched me in a way that no other story ever has. The love between Edward and Bella is indescribable; the word \\"love\\" doesn't even come close to it. To me, this story one-ups Romeo and Juliet.     These books have just baffled me. I never read books more than once, but I know I will read all of these again. I miss the characters so much already and I just finished the last book less than 12 hours ago. And no, I am not some crazed teen, but a married 23-year-old who doesn't often get \\"obsessive\\" about things like this, so this is a first for me, which goes to show the power in the story.     I fell in love with Edward, Bella, and the whole cast of characters. I was sad to finish the saga because I didn't want it to end, but it was an ending that left me feeling good inside. I would love to see more of Edward and Bella's story, but I know that chance is very slim. I would recommend this series to anyone, but if you are going to read Twilight, you must read all 4. They get better as they go! Happy reading!
B001FEA9QU|5.0|After being told that this was going to be like ...And Justice for All, but modern, I was both excited and skeptical: it was promising that they were trying, but it wasn't. Trying to do it wasn't really as good enough as actually doing it.    Starting off with That Was Just Your Life was probably a deliberate decision to show that they could still write thrash songs and start off with a bang, just like their old formula for albums (See Blackened on AJFA, Battery on Master of Puppets, and Fight Fire with Fire on Ride the Lightning). They then brought out two more thrashers then the Day that Never Comes. After one more thrasher, the album changes.    Cyanide doesn't sound like a thrash song, it sounds more like a engineered radio hit. Not that that means it's bad (I actually like it), it means that they still have commercial success in their mind. Then comes the Unforgiven III, which is more like their Load/ReLoad albums than anything. The last two echo back to the first five.    Overall, the album is good: it's probably the best thing since definitely the Black Album, and arguably since AJFA.    However, there is one point of controversy: the mixing. The distortion sounds overtly digital to me, and for those of you who aren't guitarists and don't know what that means, the distortion on the guitar is harsh. Also, there's no dynamics: everything is loud. This is definitely a product of the loudness wars, and gives the album no texture. This would have definitely benefited a song like The Day that Never Comes.

B000687M48|5.0|First I would like to say that my fan fare of Evanescence is quite new, I've only gotten into them over the past 6 months or so, but I do have all their albums. anywhere but home is a pretty good CD/DVD. The live CD captures the energy of the concert and for the first time I found an artist that does not take any songs or addition commentray out of the CD that was included in the Live DVD. What you see in the DVD live concert is what you get in the Live CD. The DVD is great. The concert has that evanescence feel and it is filled with great behind the scenes footage. They have before the show, during the show clips, after the show, and life on the road as well as some bloopers and funny story's. A Must Have for Any evanescence fan.
B0019UGYK0|5.0|Over the years, this film has become one of the most poular and widely viewed films of all time.  It is one of those rare films that is both immensely entertaining and accessible, and also takes on the \\"big\\" questions of life in an effective way.  If anything, it has been underappreciated by critics.<br /><br />Released in 1967, this film could almost be seen as the first example of \\"70's\\" cinema, a film that succeeds in being artistic in all of the best senses of the word.  It famously addresses both the question of the place of the individual in modern society, and humanity's relationship to God, and does so in a deeply intelligent and endlessly thought-provoking way.  And yet, it never comes off as even remotely pretentious and can be enjoyed by just about anyone as simply a good piece of entertainment.<br /><br />The character of Luke is very much like the character R.P. McMurphy as portrayed by Jack Nicholson in Ken Kesey's One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest.  Both are decorated war heroes and rebels who have their freedom taken away by the system over petty offenses against society.  Both are fun-loving jokers who possess incredible levels of inner strength and determination.  Both decide to take on the system in a deadly battle of wills with sinister, repressive authority figures.  And both end up as Christ figures, giving up their own lives, but inspiring the men around them, giving them back a sense of hope and meaning in life.  \\"Cuckoo's Nest\\" swept the Oscars in 1976, but \\"Cool Hand Luke\\" didn't receive its due in 1967, and its genius continues to get short shrift.  Newman's portrayal of Luke as envisioned by director Stuart Rosenberg is actually more interesting than Nicholson's portrayal of McMurphy in \\"Cuckoo's Nest\\".  McMurphy is a comic, charismatic force of nature, but he has little inner life.  Luke, however, is fascinating as an individual who has so many gifts, but whose life is caught in a downward spiral of self-destruction.  He is an individual who can do anything that he wants to do, and yet can't find it in himself to care about anything enough to do anything other than laugh and rebel, because he can see no ultimate meaning in life.  He is conflicted to the very end, searching for God and for meaning but unable to find either.  The best that he can do is find what peace he can through resignation and detachment, \\"laughing it up\\" the best that he can.  Luke is one of the most philosophical characters in one of the most philosophical films ever brought to the screen.  You learn something about life just by watching it, if you look for it.<br /><br />In addition to all of this, the direction and cinematography of this film are both original and flawless.  The cast is one of the best ever assembled on film.  The music is a perfect fit for the storyline.  The script contains some of the most quoted and quotable dialogue ever written, and a collection of unforgettable scenes.  The new, deluxe edition is highly recommeded even for fans who already have the film, as it contains a very entertaining documentary piece about the making of the film, and a very interesting and thought-provoking \\"commentary\\" study of it as well.<br /><br />It simply doesn't get any better than this.ng that he wants to do, and yet can't find it in himself to care about anything enough to do anything other than laugh and rebel, because he can see no ultimate meaning in life.

B001C48EFQ|3.0|Tag Line: Seeing movies so you don't have to.    \\"Babylon A.D.\\" is a failure, but it's not the actors' fault.  The problem is certainly not Vin Diesel's failure.  He gives an outstanding performance as Toorop, an Eastern European mercenary, banned as a terrorist from reentering his homeland of America.  And it's not the fault of Melanie Thierry, who gives a touching turn as Aurora, a young woman raised in a convent in Mongolia.  Michelle Yeoh plays Sister Rebeka, Aurora's guardian, and she kicks butt in her attempts to prevent the harsh outside world from influencing the young ward.    No, the problem lies in the missing minutes of film (anywhere from 15 to 70) that were allegedly cut by the producers to fit the movie into an hour and a half, leaving the director to disown \\"Babylon A.D.\\"  The cuts aren't readily apparent until near the end of the ninety minutes, when the characters enter America.  Then it's obvious that there are vast gaps in continuity, making for a shortened and confusing ending.  At least, the editing is the kindest explanation I can come up with.    The basic plot is a pilgrimage.  Toorop is hired by a criminal leader to deliver Aurora, along with her bodyguard, from a convent run by the Neolites, a relatively new religious feminist movement.  It turns out the Neolites want her for something she carries, but it's not exactly clear how that's going to make them an authentic religious movement. Supposedly, the miracle will legitimate them.  Along the way, the trio, and occasional other character, must struggle with the perils of a near-future, somewhat dystopic world.      It's a fairly logical projection of what's happening now.  Former Soviet Union troops work with criminals, and a nuclear sub is used to ferry refugees across the Bering Street to America.  The national boundaries are patrolled by unmanned robot planes, similar to ones we're already using in war zones.   Passports are injected into people, presumably with some sort of biologicalmarker, though it's unclear how that works.      The world implies an interesting backstory that I'd like to hear more about. For instance, the only surviving tigers are cloned, which is a clue to the mystery of Aurora, I think.  Generally the viewer here just has to run with the story and pick up the background details as he or she goes along, which is fine.  Not everything needs to be explicit.  However, some eventual explanation better than what we're given would have been nice.    All the elements of a strong science-fiction movie are here.  But once we get to America, things fall apart and the center cannot hold, apologies to Yeats.  The criminal who hired Toorop gets into a confrontation with the Neolites.  Why, I'm not exactly sure.  I'm also not sure how Aurora can plausibly have what she's carrying, but a suspicious doctor might have a role in that.      Then Toorup is saved by an amazing process that gets handwaved off.  Finally, there is a quick confrontation that boils down to a disappointing car chase.  The tempo of the last part of the movie moves much faster than the rest, making it clear that cuts were made.  We are also given practically no closure with Aurora and her fate is left uncertain.  I can't really recommend this movie in the theater.  I would wait until it came out on DVD.  Hopefully, it will have the missing elements filled in.
B00008RH1H|4.0|Akira Kurosawa's black and white 1957 film Throne of Blood (Kumonosu Jô- literally Spider-Web's Castle) is a very good film, but not quite up there with the best of his films, like Seven Samurai, Ikiru, nor The Bad Sleep Well, despite its vaunted adaptation from Shakespeare's Macbeth. That said, the hour and forty nine minute long film, written by Kurosawa, Shinobu Hashimoto, and Ryuzo Kikushima, features one of the best performances by its star, longtime Kurosawa leading man Toshirô Mifune as Taketori Washizu, the warrior who has the Macbeth role. Yet, in watching this film, I have come to the conclusion that while there is a minor influence from Macbeth, it is in no way merely a Japanized version of the Bard's play. There are just too many significant differences, as well as the clear power and influence of the Noh Theater on this film, which is absent from other historical Kurosawa classics, period films called jidai-geki.<br />  First off is the notion of determinism. In Macbeth, all the main characters have free will- they are just corrupt from the get go, whereas in this film the main actors either are fated, or- more likely, buy into the idea of fate so strongly that they live out self-fulfilling prophecies. This Orientalist determinism is at great odds with Western ideas of individual free will. It manifests itself in the fact that the minor characters in the film- despite whining about their superiors' flaws, are more or less apparatchiks, whereas the lesser characters in Macbeth are all strong willed, for better or worse. Also, the film is not only about the personal doom that we know awaits Washizu, but that which awaits his whole class of samurai warriors just a few centuries after this film is set- likely the 13 or 1400s, due to the absence of guns. Thus there is a sense of cultural apocalypse that looms- note the beginning and ending choral sequences, straight out of Noh- as well as Greek drama, and set on the steaming and otherworldly and post-Apocalyptic slopes of Fujiyama, whereas the play is more focused on individuals with internal rot, not their whole society. After all, the Great Lord Tsuzuki (Takamaru Sasaki). whom Washizu murders, was himself the murderer of the Great Lord before him, unlike King Duncan in Macbeth. The framing device lends the whole film a very Ozymandian feel.<br />  However, anyone who was entranced by the recent meager Lord Of The Rings trilogy should watch this film, for it defeats that whole series as easily as a samurai kills a foe with one stroke of his sword. Whereas it is more primal and simple a tale than Seven Samurai, it is far more interesting than the usual drama that Hollywood spews. Throne Of Blood may not be a masterpiece, but it is a piece by a master, and as such, it deserves an audience- preferably one with the intellect and ability to discern the difference between an adaptation and a derivation. Whether or not you feel it is a treatise on free will's failures vs. determinism's folly, and what side you come down on, will reveal much about yourself, and such disclosures are what all art strives to do, for after communication, revelation is one of art's greatest qualities.<br />  Lo!ptic slopes of Fujiyama, whereas the play is more focused on individuals with internal rot, not their whole society.

B0002F6AH0|4.0|It was not long after my family moved into the very first home we had ever owned, in our line's history, that I recall watching, with my dad, a really good television show called The World At War, which recounted the history of the Second World War. The documentary series was produced between 1971 and 1974 by Jeremy Isaacs of Thames Television and featured many key interview subjects, from the common soldier in all the armies to major powerbrokers such as Lord Mountbatten, war correspondent and novelist Lawrence Durrell, Hitler's architect and Armaments Minister Albert Speer, who disingenuously tries to weasel out of his responsibility for the Nazi genocide, German Admiral Karl D&ouml;nitz, Averell Harriman, Alger Hiss, film star James Stewart, who served in the US Army 8th Airforce, and General Eisenhower's driver, Kay Summersby, and Adolf Hitler's secretary Traudl Junge. There are even segments with the last survivor of the assassination plot against Hitler, Ewald Heinrich Von Kleist. It is an amazing filmic and journalistic feat that was accomplished, for so many aspects of the war that are missing from other attempts at visually documenting it are here. Isaacs got many honors for the series, from a knighthood to the Royal Television Society's Desmond Davis Award, L'Ordre National du M&eacute;rit, and numerous Emmy Awards.<br />Watching this series, again on DVD, and thinking back on my dad's removed fascination with it, when originally aired, made me realize that those days with my dad are now farther removed from the present than the war years the series documents were from his watching of them. Yet, I know why he was so rapt by the series, despite its flaws, and the fact that a more thorough and unbiased video history of the war is just begging to be made. It's because the series wisely focused on the ordinary person, like him. This focus undoes almost all the biases the rest of the series promotes, and makes the whole DVD set an easy recommendation for history buffs, yet to be used as a starting point, not an end all and be all. This series was not just the tales of the giants: Hitler, Churchill, Stalin, Tojo, Roosevelt, Rommel, Mussolini, Eisenhower. It was tales of the ordinary man, and how his contributions changed the world.<br />  Watching this series also nails the current lie that we are involved in some global struggle, a `clash of civilizations', on par with the World Wars, when we are really avaricious and unaccountable myopics absurdly trying to fend off some puny backwater terrorists. This series shows those claims for what they are- lies. Now is not a time of giants that will be studied in the future for their contributions in moving the world forward, but of small men with small agendas, which is a thing quite different, in the worst possible ways, from being ordinary men, like my dad was; ordinary men who helped change human history for the better, in The World At War.o be used as a starting point, not an end all and be all.

B00005YU1O|5.0|this movie covers a lot of ground, things that people need realize or hear at the very least.   just a lot of people talking about some very important issues. well presented, well written, properly executed and effectively implemented.  should be in every movie aficionado's collection!
031606792X|5.0|I devoured these books!  I tore through them in five days.  The final installment did not disappoint.  Some may complain that it wrapped up too neatly, but what is wrong with a happy ending?  There was still action and romance and even some humor.  I have read the series twice now, and it gets better every time.
B00005M91K|4.0|I was suggested this movie from a list of historical fiction and historical movies. And while I don't really see the connection so much I'm pleased I watched it anyway.<br /><br />I have read some of the reviews about the movie and I have to say that I agree with most of them. One person said the movie is really nothing but a screen saver, but it's more than that. And it would make a good screen saver.<br /><br />It's a wordless film. So if you're looking for that you will not find it here and that may bore you. I also wished they could have put in some context as to what was going on. For the average viewer they would almost be lost as to where in the world they are in the movie and lost as to some of the religious activities that are going on. But this may have spoiled the movie. Just note that this isn't for those not well versed in geography.<br /><br />The amazing points of the movie is that the photography, I guess you would call it cinematography, is amazing. This is what would make it a good screen saver. The outdoor shots are breath taking and it makes you want to travel the world, or, failing that, get outside and look at your own. The camera tricks are really fun too. I would love to see this in HD. It's also somewhat educational for those who are older. There is some nudity and if you're not comfortable with it, even in a cultural context, then you may want to skip over some parts.<br /><br />The movie doesn't just stick with the beautiful parts of our world. That would make the movie incomplete. There are some disturbing things. Nothing extremely violent, but some things that will make you think and feel blessed you have so much.<br /><br />It's totally worth it if you want something calm and soothing. The music is very nice and I found it worth going to sleep to also.
B001E5RD3M|5.0|There are few men that can absolutely compare to Viktor Frankl when it comes to groundbreaking thoughts on the human experience. His ideas on the existential vacuum and its effects are simply amazing. He paints a picture of his time in a concentration camp that is simply spell binding to say the least. If this weren't enough he goes on to show how that singualar moment in his life has impacted his work. Absolutely a tour de force do yourself a favor and read this book when you can. The Kindle edition is formatted a bit awkwardly but not unreadable.
B000T9OP7G|5.0|The Sarah Connor Chronicles DVD arrived to my address on time. The DVD was in perfect condition and it was brand new just like the description said.
B0000C9ZBW|3.0|Awesome watch...until the some of the woven metal links in the band came apart and started snagging on any cloth that came near my wrist.  Not too expensive to replace the band, but still a hassle.
B000PMFS2I|5.0|the most misunderstood movie of the 90s. I learn something new about it every time I see it. I love this movie!
B00192KCQ0|2.0|Listening to a new Metallica CD now is like watching a new Steven Seagal movie now. They are past their prime, unable to recapture the quality of their youth and it all about the retirement money. The sound is crap. I can mix a better album on my laptop. Lars NEEDS Beat Detective. The lyrics are unimaginative. The \\"tone\\" is not even up to Bob Rock standards. This is the last dollar I throw at Metallica. Much regret buying this album after I already swore I wouldn't.
B00007GZR5|4.0|I just saw this movie for the 2nd time today on Showtime - and it made me bawl like a baby AGAIN!  No wonder I hadn't seen it since it was in theatres.  Visually the first hour is amazing, like nothing you have seen in a movie before.  I am not sure why I react so strongly to this film, maybe it is the topic of what happens after you die, but I think it is the strong tie between the main characters, as true soul mates, that is so emotional.  We all wish for such a bond, and many of us don't or will never have it, and I think that makes the movie very sad, but beautiful.
0375826726|2.0|I was disappointed when I first heard some months ago that the Inheritance trilogy would, in fact, become longer.  Part of me wonders if the 4th book wont also end up being too long, and needing to be split.  Eragon certainly has more to do now than he did at the end of Eldest, and Paolini has made it clear that whenever Eragon swears an oath to someone, we're going to devote a whole lot of time to watching him do it.  Given that Eragon swears a new oath every 50 pages or so (give or take), it may be a while before he gets caught up.    I have long since given up on the tiresome fantasy series of Robert Jordan, Terry Goodkind, and the like as I noticed that after about the 3rd or 4th book, nothing new happens.  A series should be short, maintain our attention, and always keep in mind the primary conflict between hero and villian.      Books one and two of the Inheritance cycle did this.  At the end of Eldest, Eragon has three things that need be done, fulfill his promise to Roran, return to Oromis, and defeat Galbatorix.  The first of those is finished in the early pages of the book, but from there, we spiral away from the story and into tiresome cliche.  Eragon spends pages moaning and groaning about how he has been forced to kill, but it never amounts to anything.  Eragon and Roran spend pages pontificating at each other in conversations that make each of them sound as though they were raised in the hearts of academia, rather than on the farm.      As an aside, the characters talk way too much in this book.  For pages.  One wonders when they pause to take breath.  Even other characters notice this \\"He certainly talks alot.\\" says Saphira at one point.  Yes, I suppose he does.  But then, so do you, my dear blue dragon.  So do you...    As for the plot, what is there to say?  Of the three tasks Eragon had at the beginning, two are completed.  But with much else along the way.  Eragon visits and then leaves a mysterious hermit who'se only purpose in the book is so wewont be surprised again when he shows up next time, no doubt to give Eragon a crucial piece of information.  We spend page after page waiting for the dwarves to elect the ruler we all know well in advance will be elected in a process that isn't the least bit interesting.  One hopes that the elected leader is able to cut through the red tape.    We learn things about Eragon's father that don't suprise us in the least, and even dissapoint us, as they make Eragon a far less interesting character, and free him completely of the guilt that was the sole characteristic making him interesting.  Galbatorix's and Murtagh's inexplicable strength is explained using a plot device that I'm sure Paolini developed only after making his two villians untouchably strong.  And when Glaedr gives Eragon a gift towards the end, I knew it would mean only one thing.      This should have been the final book.      But instead of the planning and fighting against the forces of the empire, we get Eragon brooding whether or not he should eat meat or starve to death.  (He eats the meat, but feels real bad about it.)  Instead of studying new spells and magic, Eragon asks an Urgal for a bedtime story.  And instead of a climactic battle between Eragon and Galbatorix, we get a deeper insight into the dwarven political arena than is needed or even wanted.      At this point, I'm invested in the series, however, and I await the fourth (but will it be the final?) book with the same anticipation as I await a trip to the dentist, or the DMV.  It's just one of those things you don't really look forward to, except for the feeling of relief when it's all over.
031606792X|1.0|I am OBSESSED with the Twilight series. I read the first 3 books in a frenzy, reading each one in like 2 days. Then I start on book 4. I was so happy with the beginning, those who have read it will know what I am talking about. But then it went down hill from there. It didn't seem like the same characters. I was really disappointed that this is how the series is ended. It is a big let down.  But the other three books are awesome! And I cannot wait to see the movie!!
B00003W8NM|5.0|Fantastic movie based on a fantastic book. It's a little bit different than the book (story-wise), but all the changes were good adaptations to the media difference. Edward Norton and Brad Pitt both play their characters perfectly.
B000BYA4JM|5.0|The 80's brought us a lot of fun comedies.  This is one of them.  Though the movie was panned by critics at that time, let's face it, it's a fun movie to watch where you don't take it seriously and just laugh.  Madonna is just flat out funny!  Yes, she can act.
B00005NKK8|5.0|This is a must have.  It's like the history of music from the 1950's to the 80's.  Great songs!  i highly recommend this cd!
B001DDBCUU|5.0|So I don't have the special edition(but hope to soon)...but I just watched this movie twice in a 24 hour period, once normally and once with M. P. King's commentary. And I've NEVER watched a movie with the commentary playing, especially not one this length(SATC was longer then I expected, over 2 hours). The film is so fun. You laugh, cry, then laugh while you're crying.<br />  The commentary is amazing. For anyone who loves this series and has seen the all the episodes(over and over and over again!), he is eloquent, funny, tells the best little movie tidbits and was a complete joy to listen to! I was exhausted and literally could not stop watching/listening! He tells interesting things about production, things in the background, actors who appeared in episodes who he just had to have back for the movie. It was a really exciting gem for any SATC fan.
B001ANOU7U|5.0|This one of the best films I have ever seen. Bothe CCH Pounder and marianne Sagebrecht are terrific; but it is extremely sad that their talents have been underrated  The story is wonderful about the finding of one's self and the connecting with others through another person's unselfish understanding and the giving of one's self.  A film that should be seen!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B000002KAT|5.0|What is expressed in these songs, in the energy contained in them is something that I connected with very deeply.  I think that is a lot of what art is: how well something is expressed, some feeling, emotion, struggle....  To me it soothed my soul, brought meaning to my pain - told me that through it - works such as these can be accomplished.  This piece of music is a pinnacle example of the outpouring of a person's soul.  When people talk of this album, I have heard of them speak of it in terms of soul.  And I fully agree.  I feel that the palpable rawness expressed is something rare, a peek into a souls struggle.  And the fight is played out in these songs.  What a battle, get a front row seat.
0385340990|5.0|Delightful!  An 'easy' read, but good story line and introduces one to a bit of WWII history that is not part of the general history books.
B001DPHDCY|5.0|Let's be honest for a second, when you have three of the biggest comic actors come together in an animated feature, it was destined to be funny. For an animated Dr. Seuss adaptation, this is not just funny but damned hysterical and one of the best CG animated features to date. In recent years, the Dr. Seuss films haven't exactly delivered as expected so I think most people weren't expecting much, but honestly it's really great.<br /><br />The story focuses around Horton the Elephant (Jim Carrey) who comes across a speck on a clover, on that speck is whoville and run by its Mayor (Steve Carell) who everybody in whoville thinks is crazy, he also struggles to get through to his only son JoJo. Horton promises the mayor that he will have the speck put in the safest place possible but something gets in his way, Kangaroo who's the snootiest of them all and enforces every rule. She thinks Horton is crazy and he's disrupting the children so she goes out of her way to stop Horton.<br /><br />The CGI is really interesting as it's very cartoony in style to keep the Seuss feel, yet at the same time holds a level of authenticity that both blend together very well indeed. The whole concept of the film, although I'm sure it wasn't intentional is actually quite interesting. I'm not talking about our planet being in the trunk of an Elephant, but the whole possibility of there being something much much larger than our world operating in exactly the same way we do. Our planet is merely a speck in the vastness of our universe, what makes it so impossible that we are a world within a world? I know, I'm getting all philosophical so I'll leave it there, but you know what I mean.<br /><br />The comedy is quite slapstick in style as Horton finds himself in quite awkward situations along his quest to get whoville to safety. Within whoville the mayor finds himself in unusual capers to convince whoville of Hortons existence and getting to know his son JoJo. One of the more comical scenes in the entire film is the bridge crossing scene. Horton is trying to cross a rickety bridge which is very unlikely to support him and it causes quakes in whoville. The mayor is in the dentists and a shake leads to the dentist poking him in the arm with a numbing needle which is actually really funny.<br /><br />An overall awesome film which is something for all the family.dge crossing scene.

B0014Z4OQG|4.0|Film about giant creatures laying waste to New York, told from the point of view of one character who films it all on his camcorder. Human drama and monster mayhem collide in this genuinely scary production from Lost and Alias creator J. J. Abrams. The monsters in this film will freak you out. They sure did me, and although this film did not quite reach the heights I was expecting this is still a must-see film. Believe the hype.
031606792X|5.0|I really hesitated reading this last novel in the Twilight saga. I did not want to be dissapointed, nor did I want it to ruin my whole picture in my mind of the Bella & Edward forever.    I wasn't dissapointed. Meyer truly has improved in her writing and writes from different perspectives. (something I loathe from other writers) However, she was able to write from a different perspective but still allow us to see into the lives of the Cullens.    The ending is suspensful and action packed and I FINALLY felt some relief that Edward was not constantly worried about Bella and her safety. At last she could take care of her own. I loved that this 4th book didn't drag on with Bella being human for 3/4 of it because this was something that seemed to drag on forever in the last 3 books.  The surprise of Renesmee was pleasant as well because in some of the last books, I often found a \\"predictablity\\" to them, so I was glad to be surprised!    Yes, it does have a \\"happily ever after\\" vibe, but you know there are too many unwrapped pieces that could come back and probably will with their luck :)  I can sleep at night knowing this ended so happily.    This book is the best of the 4 by far. Enjoy!
B00192KCQ0|5.0|Death Magnetic is a masterpiece. Stylistically, it's similar to ...And Justice for All. But better, thanks to Rick Rubin's crisp, clean production job. The songs are tight, complex and powerful. Every instrument is audible. James's stop-on-a-dime rhythm guitar has never been more compelling (how does he do it?), Kirk's solos are amazing, Lars is thunderous, and Robert \\"The Human Earthquake\\" Trujillo brings the bass to the fore again. Put off by the length of the songs? Don't be. They're that good you'll end up wanting more. Let's look at the album track by track, shall we?    That Was Just Your Life: This song has a gentle (although slightly sinister) start, and quickly snaps to life with a stuttering guitar/drum volley. Settles into an urgent riff reminiscent of \\"Blackened\\" off the Justice album. Nice opener.    The End of the Line: Starts with the riff that Metallica first debuted in \\"The New Song\\". The body of the song has enough twists and turns to keep you guessing and an explosive waa waa solo from Kirk that brings us back to the main riff again. Finishes with some great vocals from James and thudding drums from Lars.    Broken, Beat & Scarred: A truly catchy rhythm (courtesy of Lars's machine-like drumming) that will get your head bobbing. The simple rhythm anchors the song, allowing the band to throw in different tunes along the way. You'll like it.    The Day That Never Comes: A stand-out track that starts with a plaintive melody guaranteed to stick in your head. The second half is a rip-snorter. Smooth and powerful; it roars along like a well-tuned V8.     All Nightmare Long: Some nice chug chug rhythms and a tuneful chorus. This is a fast song that should please the old-school thashers. Good solos from Kirk.    Cyanide: Fantastic start to this one: a waa waa riff (that you'll hear more of throughout the song) and some rumbling bass from Robert. More chugging guitar during the chorus and some crisp military drumming. One to sing along to.    The UnforgivenIII: No links to the previous Unforgivens that I can see. This track is supremely melodic that nonetheless has some surging guitar underneath to remind us this is Metallica after all. Towards the end, a solo from Kirk bursts out of nowhere like a sprinter leaving the blocks. Tasteful and well put together.    The Judas Kiss: Like something off Justice. Takes a bit of getting into, but worth it. A prog feel to it with abrupt changes in rhythm and good solos.    Suicide & Redemption: The instrumental. It's long - clocking in at almost ten minutes - but never boring. There's enough material here for three or four songs. It never loses its way because it keeps returning to the main riffs. All band members shine.    My Apocalypse: Another fast one. I'm guessing Lars would shed a few pounds by the end. You'll like the blaring guitars that kick in just before James bellows the song title. A great finish for the album.    Death Magnetic sees Metallica at the top of their game. Exciting and relevant. Move over Master of Puppets, there's a new benchmark in town...
B000ZN802W|4.0|If you watch the first 5 or so minutes, you might expect this movie to be lame, but it most certainly is not.  Inspired by an amazing true story, it's a very powerful film about a guy you really want to learn about.  Fine writing, fine acting, and amazing scenery.  I'm impressed.
0740748475|5.0|Amazing and wonderful collection! Nice quality of papers and I recommend it for all Calvin and Hobbes Fans!
B000PAAJYW|3.0|Looking at the summary of reviews here on Amazon, it is clear that this is a \\"love it or hate it\\" movie. I don't fall completely into either of those camps, but I thought the director was trying WAY too hard to be arty, avant-garde and mysterious. There are too many balls in the air, and for the first half of this three-hour movie the plot lines seem totally unrelated. Tom Cruise is wonderful as the smarmy \\"seduce and destroy\\" seminar leader, until the deathbed scene near the end, when he goes right over the top, wailing and flailing.<br /><br />The two main problems with Magnolia, as I see it, are that almost none of the characters are very likable, and the production is very dark. Many of the scenes are shot at night or in dark rooms, and the result is a cold, dark feel. Coupled with the sad, screwed-up lives of most of the protagonists, this makes for a depressing film.
0060751967|3.0|My first Kerrelyn Sparks book.  Light, humorous quick reading.  The style and tone are simple and matter-of-fact.<br /><br />A vampire, Roman Draganesti, loses one of his fangs by biting into a doll with synthetic blood and needs to find a dentist soon or he'll be a one fanged vamp for all eternity.  He is already the millionaire creator of synthetic blood that saves humans and gives vampires a morally correct food source.  The doll is a recent invention to give the vampires the feel of the bite while getting synthetic blood but the plastic she's made of is just a little bit TOO tough.  The dentist he meets, Shanna, is unlike any mortal he's ever met and she needs his protection because she witnessed an earlier murder and the baddies are out to get her.<br /><br />Just okay--with so many good vamp series out there, I doubt i'll follow this one.
0375826726|5.0|After a long wait...we finally have book three! I loved it, and now I'm preparing for the wait for book four (Yes book four...don't listen to the reviewer calling it the final book. This series is not a trilogy!!!)
B0012E6R3W|5.0|Since their formation Testament has always delivered and brutal assault of trash to the fans and have yet to compromize their sound which gains great respect along the lines of Slayer.  Awesome bands amazing new album!
B0007DFJ0G|5.0|The director/writer just plain got this one right.  If you read the book, then see the movie, the movie IS the book on the big screen.      Well made, well acted, well done.
B00192KCQ0|1.0|MEtallica have forgotten how to be METAL.  They sold their souls to the corporate vomit tank and have yet to return.  This album sounds like poser metal/rock.  This is a carbon copy of load.  The riffs start out decent and everytime without fail go to soft, tired, repediative garbage.  The lyrics are a mess and totally laughable, a 5 yr old with crayons could be more creative.  Now they are apparently making their next album with Lou reed.....All you need from this band is Kill em All and Ride The Lightning, the rest is complete garbage.<br /><br />&#34;Metallica unveils its ninth studio album, Death Magnetic. The band's<br />first album in five years, Death Magnetic is also its first with renowned producer Rick Rubin (Danzig, Slayer, System Of A Down,<br />Slipknot), first with bassist Robert Trujillo, and first on Warner Bros. Heavy and thrashy, unafraid to embrace the band's past yet move<br />into the future. &#34;<br /><br />Again the editorial reviewer obviously hasen't even heard the album.  Dumb paid reviews.
B00192KCQ0|2.0|Lars and the boys (band and label) must laugh all the way to the bank when they allow albums that sound this atrocious come out.  Yes, it's better than St. Anger (not too hard to do), but please stop comparing this to the real classics.  At least these songs should be a lot better live.  Unless they find a way to mess that up as well.
B000N6TYLW|5.0|I started watching this about 3 years ago and loved it. It reminded me of my mom's and my relationship. This is a great show for a mom and daughter to watch together. It is about two independent women who need no man to be successful in life.    Shannon
B000V86OKG|5.0|This series is one of the best I've seen. Michael C. Hall is perfect in his role as the serial killer/vigilante. Each episode left me wanting more-I had difficulty pausing between episodes. Viewer beware: some scenes are very graphic. Season 2 answers some questions from season 1; therefore, to get the full benefit one  should view season one before viewing season two. I can't wait for season 3 (Sept. 28,2008 on Showtime)
B0011UBDTK|1.0|DVDs would not play on either my stand-alone DVD player or my computer DVD drive.  These discs are defective.
B000T9OP7G|5.0|Really enjoyed the opportunity to catch up Sarah and company before the new season started. It was a bit of rush, but I got it in. If you're a fan of the show, then you know how good it is. Science fiction at its best. My wife, who doesn't watch it, tries to hard to rationalize everything. Its science fiction, it doesn't have to make logical sense - just good entertainment.
B0017ASV1C|3.0|Righteous Kill had, rightly so, fans across the globe salivating for a piece, the moment it was known that Jon Avnet was making a film, putting two of the most prolific and potentially explosive actors together, after Michael Mann attempted the same in \\"Heat\\", more than a decade ago.<br /><br />However, it's a sad day when stalwarts such as Pacino and De Niro are pretty much wasted on an attempt as half-hearted and clearly under-prepared as this one. The movie takes on a potentially explosive subject matter (cop serial-killer!), and twists it into such a tight knot that even the climax isn't able to do much to undo the damage that an abject script, lackadaisical dialogue, and an unnecessarily twisting screenplay have done.<br /><br />Pacino and De Niro play ageing NYPD homocide detectives, who are on the trail of a suspected serial killer who bumps off perps whom the law is unable to convict. Gradually, it becomes evident that the killer might be a Police Officer. It doesn't help understand the story that sequences in the movie are interspersed with De Niro's taped confession to all the murders, giving a detailed explanation and justification for all his supposed actions.<br /><br />Naturally, sparks fly in all directions, and the story develops around this premise. However, the dynamite delivery that the hungry audience is looking out for is nowhere to be seen, for the actual delivery of both the actors is muted, toned down, and too small to be significant.<br /><br />I fail to see why Avnet didn't develop the characters, or at least the background to the storyline, showing less of his editing skills and more of the actors' acting skills.<br /><br />Overall, the movie has its good points and can't simply be written off as a complete failure; in fact, one of the reasons it's being made out to be such a failure all around is perhaps the fact that there are such high expectations from a Pacio / De Niro pairing.<br /><br />Overall rating: 3 / 5 (one each for Pacino and De Niro resp., and one for them together!)
0375826726|5.0|This book was very exciting and active. The best part was the ending. You have to read it to know what it was like. It was the best book i have ever read.
B001FEA9QU|4.0|The mixing gets annoying, and some songs just don't have the \\"catch\\"      but when you get to \\"Unforgiven III\\" all will be forgiven
0765342294|5.0|So many reviews, not much more to say!  What a great book/series this is. This title ranks up as my number one favorite book of all time. If I ever meet anyone new and we talk about books, this is the title I mention first and recommend the most.    I've read the book so often now that the pages are all dogged and frayed, but I actually love listening to the AUDIO book even more, if you can imagine that. Scott Brick, Gabrielle de Cuir, Stefan Rudnicki and the rest of the cast bring these characters to life. So much more so than a movie ever could for me. I highly recommend the audio book on top of the written book. The emotion and power of these voice actors pulls you even farther into Ender's Saga. I get tears in my eyes every time I listen to this story and experience Enders triumphs and tragedies.     I can't count the number of times I've been listening to this book and the time just melts away. I never want to stop until I get to the end. If this were the only book I got to read for the rest of my life, I'd die happy. No joke!
B00192KCQ0|4.0|There are two types of Metallica fans: the die-hard thrash metal fans that pretty much disown anything the band did after ...And Justice For All, and there are the fans who actually enjoy their later recordings. I.E. The Black Album, Load, ReLoad, St. Anger, etc... I suppose I would fit into the latter category. Having established that fact, I can give my thoughts on the new album, Death Magnetic.<br />  After listening to the new songs several times, I can honestly say that it is a return of sorts to their heavier, thrash metal sounds of their eighties material. It's not quite as fast, or as heavy as their old stuff, but it comes awfully close. Tracks such as \\"That Was Just Your Life\\", \\"The End Of The Line\\", and \\"Cyanide\\" do seem to recall the classic \\"Eighties Metallica\\" sound. The whole album seems to try to balance a return to the past sound, and their modern sound. I suppose Metallica was trying to please everybody with this one. My only true complaint is the sound quality itself. In my car, the cd sounds fine. But listening on a stereo, you notice that everything sounds distorted and a little compressed. That is all I would really wish to change about this new album.<br />  So, the bottom line is this: This cd is a throwback of sorts to the original Metallica sound with a few modern twists added in. Is this a bad Metallica album as many are saying? Not at all. Could this cd have been much better? Definitely, with regards to sound quality.
B0017ZB8M6|5.0|Before the advent of iTunes I was guilty of buying cds for just one song. I would end up liking just that one song and that's it. I loved the song \\" I kissed a girl\\" so I figured the other songs on this cd would be good too. All I can say is WOW! I LOVE THIS CD!! I like all the songs and you can listen to the songs multiple time without getting bored with them! All the songs are different and Perry does a good job of entertwining her real life into her lyrics. I highly reccommend this cd! It's amazing I have it playing all the time now during homework,work etc. so BUY IT NOW!
B00005AG7K|1.0|This is the bootleg/pirate copy.    Who would claim to love those from whom they steal?
B001BPJJ82|5.0|This movie is definitely polarizing.  People either love it or hate it.  I fall in the first category.  The visual feast alone is worth the price of the disc and is what prompted me to buy it.  What I didn't expect was to be so moved.  There are some problems and not everyone will get it but beyond the gorgeous visuals, there is a wonderful story between the man and the little girl.  The emotional payoff is intense.  I highly recommend checking this out.
B000NTPDSW|1.0|If you are simply going to restore the dvd set everyone else already has, what good is that?  They should have restored the complete epic where the movie is in in time order!
B0014G5LG2|5.0|I have to agree with everything that the previous reviewer stated.  My only thing is that I would have liked the Timpani that starts the last movement to thunder and not be so distant.<br /><br />So here are my praises:<br /><br />- The most Emotionally wrought reading bar none so far!<br /><br />- The most Beautiful played by Any and All standards!<br /><br />- The most Lavish sounding recording, makes you almost see the players!<br /><br />- The most Convincing performance musically speaking, makes you think that this was completely written by Mahler and not taken from his sketches!<br /><br />There's no wonder that the Vienna Philharmonic is the perfect orchestra for this work!
B001CD6FKI|2.0|Help!! I just finished watching s-s-s-s-speed r-r-r-r-r-racer anddd I can't ssstop ssshaking! Aggh, My brain!!    Oh, that's better, I just took some Gabitril. I recommend that you have some handy if you decide to watch this movie (I'm just glad that I skipped the I-Max version). Based on one of the first Anime shows to find its way to the States, Speed Racer is a super-CGI, big budget version of the story about a kid and his super car, the Mach-5.    In spite of the vertigo-inducing visuals and the big budget, is the movie any good? Not really. The acting is bad, the dialog is hokey and cliche-filled. I kept wishing for the Sprittle character to become a hit-and-run victim. The racing scenes are very good - it would make a good computer game since inertia and several other laws of physics are ignored in the film.    Kids will get bored in spots but the racing scenes will keep them gyrating for days. Adults: just remember to keep those anti-seizure meds close by.
