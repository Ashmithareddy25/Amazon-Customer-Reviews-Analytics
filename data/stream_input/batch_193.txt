B00003CXN4|1.0|First things first:  The acting is pretty good, even when it is unintentionally humorous.  However, I've got to wonder what kind of person thinks that this film makes anything other than the most simplistic statments about drug traffic or national drug policies.  What was Soderbergh thinking?  The characters are all charicatures from the liberal mindset.  The viewer has no opportunity to empathize with any of the characters...the victories are hollow and the tragedies are meaningless.  See a good production of &quot;Hamlet&quot; if you want to experience internal conflict and true tragedy.  This movie is like something Dan Rather would put together.  But, Del Toro IS quite good....
B00000ICYE|5.0|The story of of a romantic affair between a pianist and a married violinist.  David O. Selznick had second thoughts about casting Bergman in this film; at one point he was considering replacing her with Loretta Young (!).  However, as filming proceeded, Bergman's proficientcy improved dramatically, as did her stock with Selznick.  The producer was pleased and impressed by her total and unselfish commitment to the success of the picture and her willingness to invest many long, hard days to achieve that goal.  Under the tutelage of Ruth Roberts, MGM's language coach - who had trained Hedy Lamarr - she learned English quickly and fluently, proving herself to have a natural flair for languages.  As sweet and lilting as the violins which permeate the film, INTERMEZZO premiered in October of 1939, and it was a resounding success; Ingrid Bergman became an international star overnight.  David O. Selznick rewarded her with a 7 year contract and she enjoyed a flourishing career as one of Hollywood's leading actresses until 1948, when she bore an illegitimate child by Italian director Roberto Rossellini.  It wasn't until 1956 that Hollywood welcomed her back; that year she won her AA for ANASTASIA.
6304698658|5.0|You can keep Rudolph, Frosty, and the Grinch.  This is the movie I pull out every Christmas.  It's both touching and hilarious.  The scene with the squirrel has me rolling on the floor no matter how many times I see it.  Make this a holiday tradition for your family!
630204135X|1.0|This has got to be one of the worse films I have purchsed and or viewed. The English sub-titles were so bad, and in most cases couldn't be made out. If you dont know swedish, and you cant read this english sub-titles, whats left. Hmm a black and white film, that while playing, I got up and finished my laundy. What a waste.
6305013578|1.0|Don't buy this. I love Metropolis. This edition is terrible. I've seen Metropolis at least 10 times at various times and in various places over the past 25 years, and I've never seen a print this bad.
B00005MP58|5.0|Perhaps other buyers purchased sets of poor quality but I can't say such about mine.  I read the reviews from other amazon customers about the poor quality of this adaption but decided to risk it and buy it anyway.  The set is supurb and I found nothing in it of questionable quality to merit such criticism.  I have watched this production several times and am more enchanted with it every time.  The performances, costumes, sets and script are fantastic, highly entertaining and the production has an over all charm that never seems to fade.  Buy this set for yourself and discover this marvelous production.  It is well worth the price.
B00004YYDI|4.0|The directors define their job as storytelling. That's what my review will be about.<BR>     I first watched this movie when I was at Mathilda's age so it was a great timing so I could communicate with the character while watching the movie. Now, at the age of 20, I bought the DVD with additional footage and watched the movie again with a whole different eye. I won't write anything about the story. I thought the story was good enough for an american movie. Still I think so. The acting was topnotch, especially Natalie Portman. When you watch a child actor for the first time in a movie, you measure his/her acting realated to the age. You say &quot;Good for a child&quot;. But Natalie plays like she's a professional actress doing this for a long time, which doubles the success of the movie. Because mostly, if there's a child actor in the movie, you dislike it because you dislike the child's acting. <BR>     So, there are great actors/actresses, there's a good plot, there's great ending, which is 50% of any movie I think, and there's great score by Eric Serra. (There's isolated score in the DVD for soundtrack fans like me)<BR>     But there are some glitches related to the &quot;storytelling&quot;. My favorite director is Robert Zemeckis because I like the way he tells his story. Steven Spielberg and James Cameron are also great storytellers, also Lucas. Besson is also good but he's a little bit light.<BR>     If you watched Fight Club, you'll understand what I mean. There are several ways to tell stories. One is &quot;Fight Club&quot; style I think. There's no logic in what you see but there's logic in the plot. One is Zemeckis Style. He tells really seriously his stories, you don't see anything which you cannot see. But he does with a great magic. <BR>     Some directors (weak ones) can't catch any of the two spirits I mentioned above. Besson, I think is between being Zemeckis and weak. There are incredibly great moments in the movie, especially the final. But there are some freebee editing and storytelling thoroughout the movie, so it makes the movie 4 stars instead of 5. But again, it's one of the best movies made in &quot;Hollywood&quot; so far because it's real, even though it's a bit heroic. The love though, is not so much believable because Matilda is too young. But hey, I'm not from America, and I'm not a girl. Still, it doubts me if Matilda can really fall in love with Leon.<BR>     So, you know the movie, buy this edition and get the real movie not the censored one.
0790744759|5.0|Judy was &amp; will always be the greatest talent around and she proved it in Meet Me In St. Louis.  Her portrayal of Esther is just perfect.  She is pure heaven and she looks absolutely gorgeous too.  The songs are fabulous and will leave you wanting to watch this movie over and over again.  I lost track of how many times I have watched it.  You'll be hooked on Judy and the film!
B00003CX5P|5.0|I'm not a Starwars fan, I didn't read the books and the comics, I really didn't know that Darth Sidius was Senator Palpatine, but as a movie, I think it's incredible. Nothing much to say, I won't try to convince old Starwars fans who don't like JarJar or Darth Maul, I just say that this is great action, great storytelling and incredible, really incredible music. It's like reviewing the score but the score is half of the movie in this one.<BR>I really loved it and will love it my whole life.
B0000508U6|3.0|I had read a lot of comparisons to radiohead, which immediately made me hesitant to pick up this cd.  Not that radiohead is bad at all, but copycats and tailcoat riders are.  Coldplay is neither, and although I can see the logic in the radiohead comparisons, I think that relationship is exagerrated more than a little bit.<BR>A friend once described radiohead as a band that &quot;couldn't care less if anyone is listening.&quot;  Well, Coldplay cares.  The one fault I would cite in their style is as much a fault of my own expectations, but Parachutes had a more mainstream sound than what I expected.  At least one reviewer in this forum mentioned the Dave Matthews band as a basis for comparison, and I think there are more similarities between Dave Matthews and Coldplay than Coldplay and radiohead.<BR>So comparisons to Dave Matthews are the kiss of death I guess.  I mean, no one wants to be THAT sold out.  But I'm okay with Dave Matthews, even though I wouldn't go as far to purchase one of his cds.  Dave Matthews makes catchy, hooky pop songs that are generic and hardly thought-provoking, but they are what they are.  Radiohead amazes me each time they come out with something new.  When it comes to Coldplay, I pretty much liked what I heard, but I was at no time ever amazed.<BR>So where exactly does Coldplay fit into this Dave Matthews/Radiohead equation?  I'll put it this way:  I picture Coldplay as a result of an accident of sorts.  Imagine if Radiohead's tourbus collided with Dave Matthews' bus.  No one gets hurt, though all passengers are startled and confused, and in the dazed aftermath, band members cannot figure out which bus they should reboard.  Coldplay has 4 members, so maybe they got three from Dave Matthews and one from Radiohead.  It's just a theory....<BR>After all that, I will say that the three top notch tracks are &quot;Spies&quot; &quot;Trouble&quot; and &quot;Everything's Not Lost.&quot;  I can't really say which influence is more apparent in those three tracks, and maybe that's the best compliment I can provide.<br />Perhaps Coldplay has an identity of its own afterall.
6300182452|5.0|A mysterious stranger (Eastwood) arrives in the desolated desert town of Lago in the 1870's.  The silent drifter arouses instant suspicion and uneasiness among the populace.  Almost immediately upon his arrival, he is harrassed and goaded into a gunfight by three bullies.  The stranger astonishes everyone by outdrawing them and killing them without showing any emotion.   The only clue to this man's past is a recurring nightmare that haunts the stranger as he sleeps in the town hotel.  The gruesome dream depicts a helpless man who is whipped to death by three shrouded men, while a cowardly crowd of citizens refuses to help......... Part ghost story, part revenge western, more than a little silly, nonetheless, Eastwood the director gave notice of a solid and exciting talent; he emerged as a genuinely talented filmmaker.
B00005QK3W|4.0|Driving Rain signals the return of Paul McCartney.It has been years since we have had a brand new album.Paul is back in form musically.His melodies and bass playing have never been better.Some songs may have weak lyrics but a few others are pretty good,especially the songs dealing with Linda(From A Lover to a Friend,Magic).Paul tries some different styles.&quot;Your Way&quot; has a country flavor,&quot;Riding into Jaipur&quot; has sitars like a George Harrison song.My favorites are &quot;Lonely Road&quot;,&quot;Magic&quot;,&quot;About You&quot; and &quot;Heather&quot;.I liked &quot;Rinse the Raindrops&quot; but admit it would have been better if 2-3 minutes were cut from its 10 minutes.&quot;Freedom&quot; is a nice addition,it will always be a reminder of that wonderful night in NYC.Finally,this CD gets better with each listen.I think it is in the top 5 McCartney solo albums.
0767805534|4.0|The episodic plot concerns two motorcyclists who take their profits from a drugs deal to head for the New Orleans Mardi Gras.  In the course of their odyssey across America, they encounter frequent backwoods intolerance........The film's lasting effect made a star out of Nicholson, who won an Oscar nomination for his portrayal of an aimless lawyer making his first experience with drugs.   An offbeat, low-budget ROAD MOVIE that has become a cult film by capturing the restless hedonism of the hippie era.  The film's surprise success insipired a wave of youth-culture movies, few of which are now remembered; although the big studios attempted to imitate EASY RIDER'S casual technique and rebellious attitudes, its impact has never been equaled.  The film cost only $375,000 to make and it grossed a whopping TWENTY MILLION at the box-office.
0375408266|4.0|Bernhard Schlink's ``The Reader'' is a fascinating book, at first, a kind of first-love story of an adolescent and an older woman and second the emotional trial of both the boy and the woman in a postwar Holocaust trial. I feel it is the second part of the book which really captivates, the first part, as the relationship between the boy and the woman develops in a stunted way with a lack of emotional attachment or closeness by the woman, something which the boy craves, does not capture me anywhere near as much. I could feel for the boy, his first crush if you like, something all boys go through, who hasn't suffered through a crush on a teacher for example. The writing is simple and to the point not too much beating around the bush and yet still eloquent, maybe because of it. In the second half of the book one finds out why the woman is so distant and why she moved away so suddenly with the boy emotionaly distraught. She was a concentration camp guard during the war and her inability to form close relationships are part of her, possible self-hatred/guilt, and fear of any sort of vulnerability especially as regards her inability to read. Through the trial we find out much about the feelings of the boy and the aftermath of his own guilt and fear and the subsequent sending to her, in prison, of tapes made by the now adult boy while he read books to her. Its remarkable and hard to put down. <br />A good book.
B00005T30L|5.0|No matter how unmanagable, anti-social or hopeless a teenager is, it's always assumed that it's just a phase, that eventually you will take your proper place in society, get a job and home, begin relationships, have a family, generally contribute to your community and society, if only by paying tax.  this process should be increasingly likely is you are as pretty, intelligent, witty, self-assured and creative as Enid in 'Ghost World'.  but what if you don't?  what happens if you bypass or postpone the 'right' decisions?  You find yourself out of the loop, outgrown by friends, ignored by family, a lack of social identity resulting in lack of identity full stop.  You become a ghost, and 'Ghost World' is a film defined by absence and lack - of people not having what they want, with major decisions taken by others as if they didn't exist; when even your ideal better half is more of a waning shadow.  Some of the crucial scenes pivoting on Enid's life occur when she isn't even there.  in such a scenario, familiar reality, with its hierarchies and compartments and classification, stops looking familiar and real, becomes a ghost world of grotesques, empty dream landscapes, randomness, spectral impossibilities.  But you can disappear from and for everyone except yourself - Enid is afflicted with an infernal self-consciousness.<br />'Ghost World' is a very funny and smart film, the ultimate teen movie.  But because the reassuring resolutions and socialisations of the teen movie are dislocated, it is an incredibly sad, almost tragic film, a kind of downbeat accompaniment to 'Amelie', another heroine as ghostlike manipulator of others' lives, threatened with her own empty solitude.  <br />'Ghost World' is based on a celebrated graphic novel by Daniel Clowes, and this aesthetic is pushed (for the first time on film it seems to me) to powerful emotional effect.  As in a comic book, the characters are mostly one-dimensional, often caricatures, the film's look broad and flat - evenEnid's front of calm, contemptuous self-assurance.  the emotion of the film, as in the classic Hollywood melodrama, is displaced onto the bright, almost day-glo colours; onto the wonderful clothes Enid wears (increasingly red, tactlessly suggesting the border between adolescence and adulthood she is reluctant to cross); onto the locales, especially Enid's and Seymour's rooms, beautiful pop culture attempts to reveal personalities ignored in the real world; onto the rich musical soundtrack, from Hindi rock'n'roll to classic, eerie country and blues; to Zwigoff's creeping, methodical camerawork.  For the patient viewer, the pay-off is devastating, in an accumulative, low-key way.  <br />this faith in popular culture (Enid's remarkable illustrated diary; graffiti; porn shops; jumble sales; old corporate logos etc.), the transient, quickly obsolescent, quickly rewritten or surpressed alternative history of America, of our own lives, the ghosts that won't stay buried, forms a merciful release from the current mind-numbing obfuscations of both high and low culture.  An Americana masterpiece.
630463949X|5.0|This dvd is masterfuly done. I cant think of one bad thing about it. If you like the Fleetwood Mac songs you hear on the radio , they are all here plus more. Even if you just like them a little bit you'll enjoy this dvd. Would be a great gift , its a pleaser. I love the stuff Lindsey does on his own. Mick realy drives the whole show , he's great to watch on stage. Everyone does a wonderful job.

B00005OB0A|5.0|To American audiences, Kylie Minogue is one of those attractive one-hit wonders; one who cranked out a less-than-stellar, and otherwise unnecessary remake of Little Eva's &quot;Loco-Motion&quot; as the 1980s drew to a close.  Sadly, she never caught on in the U.S., despite the fact that her early singles were fun and frothy little tunes, if not earth-shattering.//   After cranking out hits as part of a hit factory in the 1980s and suffering a commercial and critical dismissal in the 1990s, Kylie Minogue's dues were finally declared paid in 2000 when she launched an unlikely comeback to rival that of Tina Turner in 1984.  She guested on albums by artists ranging from Robbie Williams to the Pet Shop Boys and ultimately released her campy disco album &quot;Light Years,&quot; and it clicked--it was fun, it was just retro enough to be hip, and most of all, it was mighty good.  Suddenly, it was okay to take her seriously.//   To follow up, she's dropped a spectacular album on the market, and in doing so, reversed her musical direction and rendered herself a truly &quot;serious&quot; artist--essentially, more than a decade after we first heard from her, she has finally hit her career peak creatively and commercially.//   How good is this album?  It's sterling.  There's not a weak track among the bunch.  She doesn't resort to sliding a ballad in among the tracks, and that pays off--she sets a mood.  Kylie came to dance, and dance she does.//   The tracks pull from current music trends and classic disco (think disco supergroup Chic), but instead of sounding like a derivative of what's popular now, it's more like an integration of new sounds.  There are hints of Daft Punk, Modjo, Fragma, and DJ Spiller in the music, but Kylie brings her pop sensibilites to the table with a verse-chorus-verse lyrical scheme and more vocal growth.  In doing so, she manages to carve out a niche for herself, which is something she's rarely been able to claim in the past.  She becomes more than just &quot;Kylie Minogue, pop singer.&quot;  At this point, she's created a pop/dance sound that will ultimately be replicated by many more.//   Minogue has co-written several of the tracks, as has a long-absent Cathy Dennis--of &quot;Touch Me (All Night Long)&quot; fame--and this only underscores Kylie's growth as an artist.  &quot;Fever&quot; is much more stripped down than her previous effort, &quot;Light Years,&quot; and as such, comparing the two is like comparing apples and oranges.  They both stand on their own as milestones in a long career and offer a promise of great things to come.//   &quot;Can't Get You Out Of My Head&quot; is an obvious high point, but &quot;Come Into My World&quot; is a track in the same vein.  If you like one, you'll like the other.  She also treads into classic New Order territory with &quot;Fever.&quot;   &quot;Fragile&quot; is a sweeping mood piece with understated, breathy vocals that play off of her girl-next-door charm.  One track toward the end of the album, &quot;Dancefloor,&quot; leans toward the big disco beats of &quot;Light Years,&quot; but doesn't sound out of place here.//   For the part of the American public that has an ear for European dance music, this album does not disappoint.  It's a shame, though, that this style has made so little headway in the mainstream.  In a market crowded with a slew of soundalike rock bands, &quot;Fever&quot; would be a welcome breath of fresh air.
B00005OAJ1|5.0|Jack Black is such a laid back guy and good old fashion mouthy (...) that it makes me feel like Im back at home.  Im not sure how all the main stream folks are feeling about this release, but it just takes me back home.  I love the jokes, I seriously crack up everytime I hear Kielbasa.  And as JB put it, this was TNT.  Im just glad that at least somebody out there doesnt take themselves seriously. I mean come on we are all a little too PC.  We need to chill, sit back, and just turn up the D.  Where it goes from there is up to you.
B00005QDW5|3.0|I found this collection to be satisfying, especially with the improved sonic quiality (I can reduce my LP usage now). But why do they continue to ignore the soundtracks to More and Obscurred (sp) by Clouds that contain songs on par with anything they ever released (maybe royalty disagreements between record companies?). And why so few non-released material. Bottom Line: Good but needs improvement.
B00004Y6O7|5.0|Eddie Van halen is the Burt Bacharach of Metal. His strong melodies and orchestral-like guitar arrangements have to be heard to be believed. To fully appreciate this, you should listen to this album through headphones or sit between a pair of good quality speakers. If you only listen to one song this way, make sure it is &quot;Hear about it later&quot;. This song is a real masterpiece only fully appreciated when you can hear every intricate sound. While the last two songs don't quite measure up to the rest of the album, it still rates as five stars in my opinion.  I can understand fans debating which Van Halen album is better, but I can only assume that the reviewers' who severely bag Fair Warning, have not listened to the album or are not musically inclined.
B000002LE6|5.0|A glimpse into the personal spiritual relationship between Prince and God_ and a vast expanse of fascinating material for us.  The music is inspiring and dense with sound, the lyrics are deep, philantrophic and sometimes challenging.  Along with the cover shot, this could be the most controversal Prince album ever.  Prince wished this to be a continuous experience, thus the album plays as a single track.  That may sometimes be the most annoying part of the experience for me, because you can't just skip back a track ie. to hear the haunting confession of &quot;Anastesia&quot; or the rococco angelic &quot; I wish you Heaven&quot; or the hyper cartoon-funk-rock of &quot; Dance On&quot; .  The honesty of Love Sexy makes it a deeply artistic album that will open your inner eyes and throughly excite your ears with Prince's masterful blend of Funk-Synth-Rock-Jazz-R&amp;B-enigma and sexy spirituality.  From Cover to Content, it's a masterpiece of modern music.

B00005QIPH|1.0|All of the accolades and hype lavished on this album and on The Strokes themselves are about as easy for me to understand as a typical episode of \\"The Power Rangers.\\" To even suggest that The Strokes are heirs to The Velvet Underground's twisted vision of some 30 years ago and to mention them in the same breath as Television and, in some camps, Johnny Thunders, is just wrong. A more accurate comparision might be Jonathan Richman & The Modern Lovers, as \\"Is This It\\" features jangly guitars way up in the mix, which is great, but songs that just never seem to go anywhere, which is bad. Call me a dinosaur, but I'm still a big fan of songs that have a beginning, middle, and end. Brings back bad memories of the good money I threw after Joe Strummer's \\"X-Ray\\" album. Back to the drawing board, guys...
B000050FEN|5.0|I think we can all agree that the first version of &quot;Seven&quot; that came out on DVD was a little more than disappointing.  The picture quality and sound could've been a whole lot better.  There could've been more extras, which the first DVD totally lacked.  Most of all, the movie was on BOTH sides of the DVD, which meant that you had to change sides halfway through the movie.  Well, all of that has changed, because now you can own &quot;Seven&quot; in a new restored and loaded with extras special edition.<br />First, let's talk about the DVD.  The picture quality is outstanding and is a lot more clearer than the earlier version.  The sound has also improved greatly, (especially since you can choose DTS if you have it), and makes the movie seem more darker and twisted than before.  There are so many extras on it that it's not even funny.  There's little documentaries on making part of the movie, (like how the notebooks found in John Doe's apartment were created).  This special edition is two disks, which means there are more than enough special features that will keep you happy.<br />Now, let's talk about the movie.  Let's face it; you're not going to spend a lot of money on a DVD that you do not like just because it's loaded with extras.  Why would you want a horrible movie with great extras?  Well, this is a suspenseful and dark thriller that will stay with you even after it's all said and done.  Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman play detectives who are hunting down a maniac serial killer who kills people by their sins.  Each murder is more puzzling, gruesome, and bizarre than the last.  They must find out who the killer is before he finishes his so-called &quot;masterpiece.&quot;  How much blood must be shed before the killer is caught?  This is an unforgettable movie that will haunt you in your dreams.<br />This is a spectacular collection that really does the movie justice.  I must warn you that you might want to rent this one first before buying it.  It is a very disturbing and gruesome movie with very graphic and explicit crime scenes.  This movie is not for people with weak stomachs.  If you love the movie, then by all means, purchase this explosive DVD.  It'll leave you breathless.ery disturbing and gruesome movie with very graphic and explicit crime scenes.  This movie is not for people with weak stomachs.

B000022TSV|5.0|This is one of the best &quot;Carmen&quot;-s I've ever seen. The reason for that is, how strange it would sound, the superb supporting cast, and not only their singing is great, but also thier acting. My favourite part on this DVD is quintet from the second act. This is really amazing, five voices appear as if there was only one person singing. I think this is achieved first of all because of outstanding conducting of Maazel, who brings up the light to the performance.<br />Julia Migenes is proud and sexy Carmen, but I can say, that she is definetely not the best Carmen (listen to Grace Bumbry's performance under Karajan, or legendary Leontyne Price). Domingo is in the great shape, his voice sounds perfect. Raimondi is too good for Escamilio, Freni is superb Michaella. And finally outstanding directing from Francesco Rosi: nothing is extra and nothing is missing. Everything on the screen has its place and time.<br />Great, maybe there are better live performances, but as long as movie concerned, this movie is the best. 5 stars!

Nirvana has the best and sometimes funniest lyrics I've ever heard ex &quot;It's OK to eat fish cause they dont have any feelings&quot;  .

0790751089|5.0|I believe that Meryl Streep doesn't act, she is, when she acts (!!!). \\"Bridges of Madison County\\" is a story about a very \\"simple\\" woman.  The perfect wife, with the \\"perfect husband\\" and the \\"perfect children\\". It is about the perfect farm, the perfect home and the perfect dog in a perfect little town. Foremost, this movie is about the wife who lived to please others. She was all a woman but her true self was buried under a spotless kitchen, delicious dishes, cleaned and ironed cloth and a smile....    ....    ....    This movie made me think that to some, it is easy to take the people they love for granted but to many other, specially women, it is much easier to loose oneself in a relationship.     Men.... love your wives as God commands. Wives, to love your husband, you don't have to loose yourself.
6305558167|2.0|The DVD gets two stars for setting, tackling the Arthur legend and trying to do it with some respect and restraint.  However, beautiful scenery and excellent camera work can't negate a clumsy story treatment (granted Le morte d'Arthur is a rich work that is difficult to translate onto the screen, but perhaps an extra half hour to an hour wouldn't have hurt).  <br />Nigel Terry turns in a dismal performance.  He seems horribly out of his depth through the entire picture except, perhaps, at the very end when Arthur dies; it's at this point he gives the character a maturity and dignity that is lacking in the adult Arthur throughout most of the film.  Nicol Williamson looks like he's filling a contractual obligation and seems to play Merlin for laughs.  The rest of the actors go about their parts in a pained, self-conscious fashion with embarrassing results.<br />Buy Le morte d'Arthur (from Amazon, of course, if available) and read the legend, instead.
B00005R2M3|4.0|I was immediately hooked on Shakira after hearing her cd &quot;Donde estan las ladrones?&quot;.  Though my long forgotten college Spanish couldn't help me understand most of the words, the music grabbed me and kept me listening.  Once, however, I saw the lyrics translated,  I came to realize how talented this young woman is.  Now with her English debut, we are shown that this Columbian hottie can translate well on both sides of the equator.  While this new cd doesn't quite achieve the brillance of its predecessor, it does allow her fans to see the appeal of an artist that is THE complete package---beauty, brains and talent.  With the infectious lead off single &quot;Whenever, Wherever&quot; to the &quot;dare-you-not-to-dance&quot; English version of &quot;Ojos Asi&quot; called &quot;Eyes Like Yours&quot;, I'm hooked again.  Other songs like &quot;Underneath Your Clothes&quot; and &quot;Objection (Tango) are really good and make the cd worth having.  I think there is a great deal more we can look forward to from Shakira.
0920668364|5.0|My mother gave me this book for my 16th birthday, also 2 months before she was diagnosed with cancer and 4 months before she passed away.  It is one of my most dear personal belongings.  I'm currently buying 5 copies for my sister and sister-in-law to give to my 5 nephews.  If you're a mother with a son, I recommend you do the same.
6302878527|5.0|at first, i didn't really get this film(you have to pay attention to the plot,not just at audrey!) but after countless viewings, i have to say it's one of audrey's best films. it's not as glossy as charade and funny face but everyone looks really hip and the film is very sixties, especially the scene on the riviera when albert finney picks up a faye dunaway-esque blonde in a sportscar. the film is also very funny and the supporting roles are excellent.
6303461484|5.0|Citizen X is a deceptively simple film that tells the true story of the Soviet Union's most notorious seriel killer, Andrie Chikatilo.  Played by a chillingly nondescript Jeffrey DeMunn, Chikatilo kills 52 people (including children) over an 8 year time span.  Perhaps the most disturbing aspect of the film (and the murders themselves) is that Chikatilo was not some Hannibal Lectorish genius nor was he a Ted Bundy-type who hid his evil behind a facade of normalcy. Instead (in the film, at least) he comes across as a rather pathetic man whose guilt would be obvious to just about anyone who came across him.  However, as the movie explains, Chikatilo is lucky enough to be committing his crimes in the Soviet Union; the leaders of which refuse to acknowledge that any citizen of a truly communist state could still be so sick as to commit such terrible crimes against his fellow workers.  This is not an obviously political movie and it certainly never makes the mistake of distorting the facts for the sake of propaganda.  However, it does carry a very important subtext -- i.e., when a society refuses to acknowledge the importance of the flawed individual over the faceless and nameless mass, men like Chikatilo emerge from the shadows of that society's willfull ignorance.  (One is reminded, in fact, of how the search for Jack the Ripper was hindered by the Victorian sensibility that the murderer had to be the member of a certain gender and social class.)<br />The police detective who eventually captured Chikatilo (with little help whatsoever from his superiors) is well-played by Stephen Rea who brings a low-key sadness to the role.  Eschewing the stereotypical &quot;supercop&quot; role that seems to show up in most recent police procedurals, Rea instead emphasizes his character's innate decency.  When he becomes obsessed with finding and capturing Chikatilo, it is not portrayed as some sort of cat-and-mouse melodrama but instead the reaction of an inherently good man who cannotsit idly by.  In perhaps the film's most riveting moment, Rea shocks his superiors by breaking down into tears when they refuse his request for more aid.  Its an unexpectedly human moment and its impact is devastating, especially when Rea's superiors respond to his unexpected emotions with the same disbelief given to the idea that the Soviet Union could spawn a seriel killer.  <br />The film is very well directed by Chris Gerolmo who, for the most part, resists the temptation to sensationalize the crimes or play for cheap reactions.  He emphasizes the starkness of communist Russia and supplies the film with an even pace that, while never boring, will probably catch viewers looking for a schlocky thriller off guard.  <br />Obviously, all of this could add up to a pretty heavy and depressing film and Gerolmo, smartly, does provide the story with some much needed comic relief by casting Donald Sutherland as Rea's only ally in the communist leadership.  Sutherland gives an excellent performance (for which I believe he won an emmy) and brings a slyly sarcastic touch to many of his lines.  Rea and Sutherland make a likeable team and their scenes together have a warmth that this chilly film needs.  As well, Max Von Sydow shows up in one of the roles he seems to specialize in; a cameo as a psychologist who provides a state-forbidden profile of Chikatilo.  Von Sydow does a great job; as does the rest of the film.
B00000DHRX|5.0|i  am  a fan  of  george  buy  this  c/d  you  will  love it
B00005OWEG|3.0|I love this film.  I saw the &quot;Redux&quot; at the Academy premiere in July 2001 and couldn't wait to buy the film on DVD for the second time.  But I recently saw the DVD and where are the special features?  No Coppola commentary?  No &quot;Hearts of Darkness&quot; documentary&quot;  Great movie, but my original DVD has more features than the Redux.
B00005U18E|5.0|Not your typical Brittish Comedy...Better! First there is Renee Zellweger (becoming more seasoned with each film) doing a fabulous job of carrying off the lead in this comedy only too well. It features Hugh Grant in a role he's not accustomed to but, handled very well. Then the &quot;treat&quot; in the film...Colin Firth who has been very underrated in films for far too long. This being the best part he's had that I've seen since his appearance in &quot;Circle Of Friends&quot;. The remainder of the cast is superb and the film well executed. The icing on the cake are Bridget's own group of friends who support their friend very well and add all the bubbles to the champagne that this film deserves. A Great Brittish Romp it the Grand Tradition that carries over very well on this side of the Atlantic. BRAVO to everyone involved with this film. I highly recommend it.
B00000DHTF|4.0|Tracks has been a gift to all of us who enjoy great rock music in this era of manufactured pop.  Bruce has kept some great songs hidden away from us (at least the ones the bootleggers haven't gotten their hands on!)  There are some missing gems such as Tokyo(And the band played...),If I Was The Priest,Evacuation of the West which were on the Before the Fame disc that Bruce sued to get off the market, as long with Break-Out, Phantoms, Sugarland, Glory Days with extra verse, and County Fair.  But this 4-disc set has enough music to keep any boss fan happy.<BR>Disc 1:<BR>You get to hear the dylanesque early Springsteen demos and word play gone overboard with songs like Bishop Danced.   Fans of Wild &amp; Innocent will love Zero and Blind Terry, it's in the same vain as Incident on 57th street about teenage romance.  Thundercrack is amazing and Seaside Bar Song rocks, it's amazing these two tracks never got officially released!<BR>Disc 2:  <BR>Starts out with some decent outtakes but just like the River, it has it's up and downs.  The highlights include Loose Ends which should have been on the album, Roulette, and Wages of Sin which is a Nebraska outtake.  It's to bad they are put between such clunkers as Where the Bands Are, Be True, and Mary Lou.  The end of the album features an acoustic Born In The USA and a wonderful Shut Out the Light which would have made the BUSA album more relevant.<BR>Disc 3:<BR>Born In The USA outtakes and Tunnel of Love outtakes.  This disc will appeal to the Born In the USA fans with songs like Cynthia, Stand On It, Car Wash, Man at the Top, Pink Cadillac, and TV Movie.  The gems are Frankie which was tried several times to make an album, and Janey Don't You Lose Heart which would have given Bruce another hit single.<BR>Disc 4:<BR>Very personal album with some good story songs about life.  Also has some songs that fans of his rock songs won't like.  Gave it a Name, Over the Rise, Loose Change, and Brothers Under the Bridge are great story songs.  Some touching songs about love include Sad Eyes which is kinda like Secret Garden.  Happy and Back In Your Arms are also pretty good.  The rest depends more on your taste I guess as I didn't find them to listenable.  Brothers Under the Bridge is probably Bruce near the top of his game when it comes to songwriting.<br />If you have almost every Springsteen album, then this just makes sense to get.  Enjoy it and maybe one day someone will come along as good as Springsteen and get us out of this mediocre music era we are in now.
B00005QZ7U|1.0|From even before the opening credits this is one the most self-absorbed, self-referential, &quot;hey, look at me and what I can do!&quot; pieces of film I've ever seen.<br />The story, such as it is, is hackneyed. The camera-work would give even an MTV producer motion sickness. The characters are crude stereotypes. The performances are, at best, mediocre. And the music? Well, it was sort of cute the first time these turn of the century folks belted out a top 40 tune. But the fifth time McGregor launched into a tortured, whispered cover of Elton John's &quot;Your Song,&quot; well, it was time to get out.
B00003CXXJ|5.0|I don't know why I didn't see this movie when it came out in the theatre, but it was a big mistake. Even if the character animation isn't as good as Pixar's. The story was much better! The second DVD is also worth the price. For me the technical part was the most interresting but everything else was really entertaining and fun.<BR>I can't wait to see the next one.
6300183971|5.0|Well, I have to say this is heck of a good movie. I like it becaus I just like it. Maybe it would even be better if they'd<BR>skipped the 'child-in-the-womb' scenes, becous that was discusting. <br />The movie itself are as I expected. The characters and suits and<BR>ships AND all that stuff fit perfectly, as in the book. If you<BR>want to see Dune:Miniseries, do not, it will ruin Dune. Trust me.
0385505833|5.0|I like to read and watch everything about Christmas. I could not imagine however, that a book by John Grisham could be this entertaining on the subject of Christmas.<br />Each page is filled with fun and and enjoyment. I have felt the way the main character does at some time in my life and I am sure many of the readers of this book will have had these feelings. I have a great deal of admiration for his attitude and his determination.<br />Those whose choose this book with have a wonderful time. The spirit of Christmas lives in this book. Have a Merry Christmas time reading this tale.
B00005N5S5|4.0|I like this movie. It may not have as good or as realistic and<BR>grippling technology as the sequel, but it's worth whatching.<br />I especially like the dark and cold future, a world led by machines that slaughter the human opposition. It would be realistic if the date was only sat a little further, like 2140-something, becous I do not believe that it takes 5 years to biuld a super-self-thinking/race-expanding computer.
B000002AE3|5.0|TOTO is one of my favorite bands of all time made up of finest studio musicians on earth. Their 1982 album TOTO IV made huge hits such as Rosana(#2),I Won't Hold Back(#9) and Africa(#1) and won them multiple grammy awards. Other major hits include Hold The Line, 99, I'll Be Over You, Pamela and so.<br />After their official compilation Past To Present in 1990, TOTO crew assisted Tommy Denandar's solo project Radioactive in 1991 and put out their own Kingdom of Desire in 1992. Jeff Pocaro's untimely death that followed didn't stop them and we now have Tambu released in 1995(sort of Japan-first pattern). It is one of my favorite Toto albums.<br />Gift of Faith mighty-edged pop rocker opens the album gracefully. I Will Remember,one of my top favorites is well written ballad and I personally like it better than similarly styled I'll Be Over You in Fahrenheit album. The Other End Of Time is also classic TOTO ballad. Time Is My Enemy, a classic TOTO marked by magnificent drumworks is my #1 favorite. Drag Him To The Roof is catchy pop rocker. Just Can't Get To You is great ballad as well. The Road Goes On should have become huge hit. Very nice song. Blackeye is a 38 Special styled southern rocker.<br />Tambu is a nice example of 90s hidden melodic rock treasure.
B00003CXA6|5.0|Although it would be impossible to tell the story of Gettysburg in less than a mini-series, the movie (and the book), provide a balanced insight into the situation and human sacrifice. If you don't feel a cold shiver run down your spine as Jeff Daniels calls for a bayonet charge because they've run out of ammo or as the Virginians step out after the artillery duel to begin Picket's Charge, you're just not human.  Recently we've discovered that we had at least three relatives at Gettysburg, serving in the 26th NC Troop (Part of Heth's Div).  During the first day's fighting 588 of 800 of the 26th were killed or wounded, included two relatives.  The remnants of the 26th were part of Picket's Charge, ending their fight at Gettysburg with nearly 90% casualties.  My two relatives were wounded, with one passing five weeks later in a Union hospital, the other surviving to fight and be wounded again defending Petersburg in '64.
B000001Y79|5.0|I absolutely LOVED Tragic Kingdom. It has the edge that makes no Doubt what it is, My favorite tracks are:<BR>Spiderwebs<BR>Don't Speak<BR>Just a Girl<BR>If you have not already bought this CD, I suggest you go out and get it. Along with many other No Doubt fans, I am anticipating Rock Steady. Gwen's vocals are amazing!!!!!!! Just a Girl is my anthem! I can relate to it a lot. Remember: ROCK STEADY!!
B00003CXXJ|3.0|When I first saw Shrek I said to myself that I had to buy the dvd once it was available to the public. Then the official press realese came out stating all the &quot;wonderful&quot; extras the dvd had... It sounded  terriffic that I started counting down the days until Nov 2. <br />Dreamworks threw all the effort away with this DVD, the extras suck big time, they are not even funny. The characters interviews are a waste of Memory and processors time. And why they repeat some of the same features in both DVD's? <br />The set is full of games that are somewhat worth the price of what you are paying, but if you are not into learning how to draw Shrek's face, and singing along with the characters, the games are just a waste of space.<br />Dreamworks still has a lot to learn about the dvd making from Disney. Disney Dvd's are by far a better experience and a better deal in terms of real special features that are a complement to the actual film.<br />Nevertheless  Shrek is a great Film a must see...!
6305558167|5.0|This is an incredible mythical story.  I really love this movie.  I have always like knight and gothic tales but, this was well done and the battle scenes were good too.  Classic tale of King Arthur brought to life in a large scale way.
B00004XONN|5.0|Man, what incredible growth this band has gone through.  I wrote off Radiohead after &quot;The Bends&quot;.  Nothing up until &quot;Ok Computer&quot; did anything for me.  &quot;Kid A&quot; is THE album by this band that turned my head and made me very much like this band.  I would think if your alternative taste buds reach back to 70's Eno and Berlin-era Bowie you are gonna like this.   It's funny, this CD was out a year before I heard it.  I kept reading how weird it is, but I find it very accessable and interesting.
0385484518|5.0|This book surprised me.  I wasn't expecting to be emotional by reading it.  After reading this book I wanted to go back and thank many of the people who have meant so much to me in my life.  <br />If you have someone who you call a mentor or who has spoken into your life...read this book and do something about it.
B000002AV5|5.0|All of the very best of this soulful diva all here in one cd. Where else can you get 16 of the very best tracks ever written? These are the songs that make you smile after a rough day, songs that relax you after feeling full of tension, songs that you want to share with your lover and as I'm sure is true for a lot of us - songs that you DO share with a lover! Sade, along with my very other favorite diva Teena Marie, is very underrated and it is so unfortunate that not many listen to this songs filled with so much meaning and emotion. With her exotic looks, doe eyes and sultry voice, Sade has been around for a very long time - and the reason why is all here on this CD. And she's not going anywhere. And the reason for that is all here too!
B0000399WI|5.0|This is my favorite movie of all time.  I have reviewed this movie for Yahoo.com but, I like it enough to review it again here.  Freeman and Robbins made a great on screen dual male lead.  This movie is filled with realism and suspense.  I must say the first time I watched it I was stunned at the twist ending.  I should also say this was a movie adapted from the book &quot;Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption&quot;, written by Stephen King.  King is an incredible story teller.  I like this movie better than another adaption.  I have enjoy Kings work for many years but, this is really a deep story line.<br />I can't think of a scene that I like any better that the twist scene so I will not detail it as to hold the suprise for those who haven't seen it.  Its a great movie just buy it and enjoy.
B000001E8P|5.0|I admit it; there was a period of time in my life when I was a big fan of Britpop, but even though my taste in music has moved on, this is one of the few albums of that genre that I can still listen to today without cringeing.  &quot;Different Class&quot; was released about fifteen years into &quot;Pulp&quot;'s existence, and it is unlike any album they had released before or have released since. I don't know what spirits were conjured up in the studio to create such a great album as &quot;Different Class&quot;, but unfortunately,&quot;Pulp&quot; out did themselves. It's fair to say that this album is a masterpiece, and everything else &quot;Pulp&quot; has done does not measure up to it.  With that said, &quot;Different Class&quot; is probably one of my all time favorite albums in any genre.
6305622930|5.0|I must say that I really don't like movies made in the 70' because I a child of the computer generated film.  However, that said, this movie is breathtaking.  I think this movie insipires a side men that has been lost since WWII.  Of all the genre of war I like this movie the best.  I was overwhelmed by George C Scotts potrayal of Patton.  His facial expression and eyes seemed war torn and battled.  I think the cast director deserved an oscar.  Scott's acting is awesome.  One of my favorite scenes is the contrite patton beseeching the Lord for another command.  I must say that is the best of Hollywood.<br />As the movie says Patton was made for war.  My favorite line of the movie..&quot;God help me I do love it so...&quot;.  That has to be the overall tempo of the movie a man who loved war for simplicity of war itself.  In short this movie is well worth 3 hours.  If you like war, WWII, or historical movies this is a must.  <br />I could watch this movie every week.
B000002TQB|5.0|Despite the fact that the song &quot;Girls &amp; Boys&quot; would make my top ten list of &quot;Gayest Songs Ever&quot;, &quot;Parklife&quot; is a brilliant album.  It established &quot;Blur&quot; as a band that is not only capable of creating catchy songs, but is also a band that is made up of musicians that are actually talented.  The songs on &quot;Parklife&quot; sound as if they were composed, written part by part.  When's the last time you heard an &quot;om-pa-pa&quot; song (&quot;The Debt Collector&quot;) on a pop album?  Unfortunately, the mega-hyped arrival of &quot;Oasis&quot; in the U.S. overshadowed this great album.
B00005QXXO|4.0|This live recording of Radiohead sounded OK to me. It takes material from their two most recent albums, in a way that's pretty faithful to the original studio tracks, i.e. without much improv or rearrangements done, which I found as a bit of a turnoff. Plus, the quality of the recording wasn't outstanding: it was just OK. Yet, I'm a Radiohead fan, and having the opportunity to have an official live album by the band was something everyone was expecting for a while. Having said this, if you don't have any previous Radiohead material, don't start here: get a copy of The Bends and OK Computer to begin with.
6305907145|1.0|I was thoroghly disgusted with this movie and the completely untrue portayal of the main character, Fanny Price.  The director of this movie only used the original storyline as a beginning point to form a twisted tangential plot filled with characters sharing the same names as the characters in the book, but with completely different morals and purposes.  The acting was very good, but the content was offensive.  This horrible remake of an originally uplifting and moral story belongs in the very popular class of movies that draw viewers using sex and lurid topics as a hook.  It is unfortunate that a writer as talented and intelligent as Jane Austen should have her works twisted and mangled in such a grotesque fashion.
0679746048|5.0|This is a good book. <br />There's not much else I could say that wouldn't belittle the writing or the writer, so I prefer to keep it at that.<br />It's a good book. <br />Despite the fact that it's been made into a movie.<br />It's still good.
B00005IC2H|5.0|This is heart-wrenching stuff... and I can't even understand what the guy is singing about... The music speaks to every part of me, it's not funny... the whole album is a masterpiece of sound... from the guitar distortion, to the strings, to the guys voice, to the EXCELLENT melodies, it all fits together perfectly... I saw the video for track two on tv, and I thought it was great, and I wondered who it was by... Sigur Ros? Who's that? Then I saw it in a store here in town and I picked it up... well my goodness, what a beautiful album... what a great piece of music to relax to, and learn about yourself... I dunno, I just find that I become introspective when I listen to it, and I just find it speaks to every part of me... absolutely beautiful... my favorite tracks are track 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, and 9... definately you should check this out...
6305508550|4.0|I don't think this is the \\"best movie ever made\\" like several other reviewers have stated.  *However, if you have been laid-off, due to a reorganization or corporate downsizing, you WILL relate to this movie and you MUST see it.  It is quite funny and every character in the movie will remind you of someone you work with.  Again, if you have ever been laid-off from an office job, you must see this movie!
B00005O5CM|4.0|This film was hilarious and heart-warming without being raunchy and tasteless (i.e. &quot;American Pie&quot;, &quot;Scary Movie&quot;). Reese Witherspoon's performance was witty, cute and vivacious as Elle Woods. I thought that she was a bit ditzy to apply to Harvard Law School only to win her man back, but by the end, she proved that she didn't need Warner Huntington III to complete herself. This film has a great motto for young girls: &quot;Believe in yourself, a guy does not complete you&quot;!
B00003CXZ1|1.0|The Tombraider series has done well as a video game, mainly due to it's good gameplay and the main character, which the designers managed to give a personality (as well as breasts)that supersedes the other paper thin characters in the video game market. <br />However, that does not mean that it would transfer well into good cinema, where breasts just don't cut it as good character development or story telling. <br />The film project starts well enough by getting Angelina Jolie. While her accent in this movie is mixed at best, she looks the part and has the body to match. <br />However, the rest of the pieces that make the Tomb Raider pie fall completely short. <br />Simon West, a mediocre director at best, is not known for movies where character development is prevalent. I mean, in his Con Air, he has accomplished actors like John Cusack, Nicolas Cage (at that time), Ving Rhames and John Malkovich, but ends up making them paper characters, secondary to his image that movies should be a montage of 5 second cuts and involve one big explosion after another. <br />The writing team is little better and the story they provide is so preposterous, that they should be blacklisted for trying to subvert the already simple minded summer audiences into mindless zombies. <br />Lara Croft is a rich aristocrat type who is also a part proclaimed archaeologist. She get's this from her father who is also an archaeologist, but mysteriously disappeared while trying to find the location of the &quot;Clock of Ages&quot;, a wonderous object that can bend time when the planets are aligned (once every 5K years). <br />The force behind finding the clock and it's various parts is a group called the Illuminati, and they discover that Lara unwittingly has the first piece, which is needed to find the other two pieces, which operate the clock. <br />There are many problems that even my huge &quot;suspension of disbelief&quot; mind cannot ignore. <br />1. It seems like Lara knows every language inthe world. I mean, how many people can fluently speak Thai, Russian and can read obscure symbolic mumbo jumbo like it was all English? <br />2. She is bullet proof. She has the Arnold Swartzennegger, Commando syndrome, where bullets do not apply to her. 15 Commandos raid her home and she takes them all out without the need of a gun. <br />3. Scenes which involve getting a piece for the clock are arranged just like a video. Okay, I know this is based off a video game, but do you have to make it THAT obvious? <br />4. She is immune to cold. How many people can cross the Siberian wasteland in a T-shirt and a thin (often open) jacket? <br />5. She doesn't have to think. All the mysteries are given to her. And anything she doesn't know, the movie gods give her the answer without having to research any of it (this becomes apparent when a dog at the end of the movie walks through something that no one on earth has ever have seen before). Of course Lara knows that was a &quot;time storm&quot; and the effect that it would have, as if she sees such things on a regular basis. <br />Lara also doesn't seem to have much of a pulse. Her facial expression never seems to portray fear, nervousness or a sense that she might be in big trouble. Her voice rarely climbs above that sultry level she speaks, even if ten stone soldiers just tried to kill her. <br />Combine this with a one sided badguy who the director badly portrays as neither very evil or redeemably good and a love interest that she seems more annoyed with, Tomb Raider is my pick as one of the worst summer popcorn movies of 2001. <br />The DVD does a fair transfer and the sound effects are well done. If I had more interest in this movie, I would have checked out the special features, but I didn't. I turned this DVD off as the first credit opened and returned it for my money back
B00005N83M|5.0|J.Lo has done it again! Only this time it's better! For all fans of \\"If you had my love\\" and \\"Waiting for tonight\\" there's \\"Love don't cost a thing\\", \\"Play\\" and tons of other similar hits. There's even something for everyone like \\"Carino'\\" who liked her Latin and dance mix singles. Fabulous #1 tracks and great singles different from her other hits include the catchy \\"Ain't it funny\\" and of coarse the #1 Billboard R&B hit \\"I'm Real\\" featuring Ja Rule. That is probably the song that makes the Cd one to buy since you don't get this track in the normal version. It also makes it a CD for all Mary J. Blige and Ja Rule lovers.  Also her dance mix singles are better than anyone else's hits. Also if you don't really like Steps, you'd love this CD. This Cd is probably great for it's fast catchy hits not counting the \\"I'm Real Remix\\" which isn't fast but is great! Although some of her slower singles aren't that good, in the first album if you liked \\"Feelin' so good\\" you might also like this. This is one CD that is worth buying. A great artist with a great album! It has something for people with all kinds of Music Tastes!
6305718903|1.0|To Whom It May Concern,<BR>I don't know where else I can indicate that the person who has ordered this Rated R video (Nat Bondy) is 16 years old. I'm disturbed by the possibility that she can get her hands on this sort of stuff and order it.
B00003CXSM|4.0|&quot;You know that old saying, 'Those who can't teach, learn'? Well, those who can't wed... plan!&quot; Such is the motto of Jennifer Lopez's character in &quot;The Wedding Planner,&quot; the most charming film to hit the big screen in a long time. The story follows the life of a young woman who has always had a passion for planning weddings, from the first instance of a Barbie celebration in the opening credits, to her undertaking of the biggest, most expensive, and most elusive wedding ever planned.<br />Only one problem. She has unknowingly fallen in love with the groom! What follows is a hilarious and yet often touching drama of trial and error as both wedding planner and would-be-groom attempt to straighten out their feelings. The movie translates well to the DVD disk and includes several short featurettes, trailers, missing scenes, commentaries, and more. I was not pleased with the Director's Commentary, which involves much more profane language than the film itself, but much enjoyed the other highlights. <br />The film is well worth your time... and the &quot;goodies&quot; that the DVD employs guarantee a thumbs-up.

So I got 6(!) tickets in one time... for the whole family. After a stunning show, I really don't know how late it started and ending time, my sister said:&quot;Mom, dad, I want this every day in my bedroom!!!&quot;<BR>Many years later I got the video, on a CD-convention in Amsterdam, and there it was: Pink Floyd P.U.L.S.E.! I Bought it from a German salesman for DM 30,= and I watched it and I was stunned again! It was again amazing what I saw.<BR>If your a Floyd-fan, you should buy this video! It is well worth the money!!!
0061040967|5.0|This is a short story, a novella at most, but it's wrapped in the gorgeous illustrations of Paul Kidby. And while the story is short, it features the Patrician, Cohen and the Silver Horde, Carrot, Leonard of Quirm, the Librarian and, once again in an astronaut, er..., chelonaut suit, Rincewind.<br />Cohen and the Silver Horde (except Vincent the Ripper, who choked to death on a concubine) are on a final heroic quest: they are going to return the fire that was stolen from the gods. With interest. And while anyone can sympathize with their grievances, it will mean the destruction of the Disc. So it's up to our favorite characters from Ankh Morpork to stop the unstoppable. <br />The plot's not bad, but the illustrations range from quite good to jaw-dropping stunning. In particular, I was knocked over by the drawing of Elephant-rise from the Disc's moon. A conscious parody of the famous NASA photo of earth rise from the moon, it transcends parody and makes the Disc suddenly real. As others have noted, Death and the kitten is pretty fine, too. Kidby has thought it through.<br />Even in a novella, Pratchett manages to introduce a memorable new character, perhaps the best since Bilious, the Oh God of Hangovers from &quot;Hogfather.&quot; Evil Harry Dread, and his Shed of Doom, a Dark Lord who has always played by the Code, always hired really stupid henchmen, and always left a back way into his Tower of Doom. <br />So Evil Harry, Cohen and his Silver Horde, the gods themselves come to a final confrontation at the home of the gods, Dun Manifestin, with the future of the disk itself at stake. Will the Ankh Morpork chelonauts arrive in time? Will the disk be saved? Does Rincewind _really_ look like that?  Can Pratchett possibly top this?<br />Great fun, wonderful art and another excellent entry in the Discworld series.

B00003CX5P|5.0|I have heard SO MUCH about how this story has no plot and no story...but, if you really think about it in the big picture, along with the 3 already written chapters, you will see that that there is so much intriguing stuff going on that ties in SO WELL with the other stories...for example, take senator Palpatine...this is the future emporer of the Galactic Empire, and it's interesting how he came into power.  Small things like that...that's why I say watch it more than once...Lucas had to really set up his story for the future episodes, and did a great job and tying everything together...and then some.
B00003CXD0|5.0|Dustin Hoffman is just amazing in this movie. I actually prefer him as the Tootsie character, Dorothy Michaels. Could someone just make a movie and cast him as Dorothy? So many funny lines and Terri Garr's best film ever, except maybe Young Frankenstein. Sydney Pollack as Dorothy/Michael's agent is also hysterical. He should act more. I've already forgiven him for &quot;Eyes Wide Shut.&quot;
0449911357|5.0|If I could give this book six stars, I would.I enjoyed every minute of reading this book. Sometimes I would laugh out loud, sometimes I would cry, and sometimes I would laugh and cry at the same time. I just love Fanny Flagg's humor. She is so genuinley southern, and so intelligent, and this shows in her writing. The story is about &quot;down home&quot; country folks in Alabama back during the depression, when there were fewer people, making each one more precious than today. Flagg displays the ugly side and the beautiful side of human nature as few writers can do. She doesn't need trashy shock to entertain her reader, so you wont find that in this book. If you saw the movie, you still owe it to yourself to read the book, because the book was much better.
6305657947|1.0|This completes Pierce Brosnan's &quot;Triumvirate of Turds&quot;: Thomas Crown Affair, Dante's Peak, and Tailor of Panama. I especially despised Rene Russo's performance. I mean she's always irritating and grating but in this one she's simply intollerable. The woman emotes about as much as an empty bag of bread. Really bad. But still better than Tailor.<br />It really frightens me there are people in this world who sincerely like this movie. I can just picture them sitting at their computer, stroking one of their 18 cats, waiting for Prince Charming to show up at their door and wisk them away to a wonderful fairy tale land like in The Thomas Crown Affair, and then seething with anger because someone didn't think this movie was the landmark achievement of the millenium. In what environment does one grow up that would lend itself to seeing any possible redeeming features in this film? I'm torn between a cardboard box (hey, that also describes Rene Russo in this movie!) or raised in isolation by a herd of sheep.
0201485672|4.0|At first glance I wanted to give this book only three stars, since I still think that if &quot;we&quot; (designers, programers, etc.) would never need the stuff that is in this book as heavily (or at all) if we all would be doing our jobs as we should.<br />Now that I have read almost all of it, the book is really more on par with the 'Gang of Four' design patterns book, but then not from a design point of view, but from the point of view of practical day to day programming, where almost always code you need to change is spagetti.<br />Even the best designed software degenerates into spagetti very fast because of lack of documentation, lack of interest in other programmers that made changes to read documentation and just hack into the source code whatever is needed at that time, etc.<br />In such a screwed up situation - which we should never get into, but in practice almost always are... - the information in this book can really help you. It might even merit 5 stars, but I refuse the give it that because I still think the book says &quot;it's okay to screw up and not really do your job properly in the first place; you can always do a bit of refactoring if it gets too much out of hand&quot; and I do not like that frame of mind at all.<br />One of my pet peeves is that, because I work in a VisualBasic environment, the examples and indeed some of the refactorings themselves often lean somewhat heavily on Java and its features. That's no problem to me, but might be for &quot;VB-only&quot; programmers. But with a little more time (with .NET) this problem should vanish and this book should be even more useful to the VB community out there.<br />Despite that I do not agree with the books premise, I still recommend it to all programmers.
B00003CWPR|4.0|Kubrick is still the master. Graphic, but entirely human in its depictions of fear, desire, jealousy, lust, love, hate, and finally, understanding. <BR>love it or hate it, it will stick with you for days. It's provocative and depicts the pitfalls and sometimes-grave consequences of leading a hedonistic lifestyle. Moody and atmospheric. Great performances, beautiful cinematography and a slow un-Hollywood like pace that draws you into the mystery as the film progresses. <BR>a worthy conclusion to one of the greatest directors of the last millennium.
B00005KFUM|5.0|A friend of mine, knowing how I can't handle Brian Molko's voice, thought Matt Bellamy would annoy me, too, so she hesitated to loan me their first album. But I liked Showbiz, (even with Matt's wacky breathing style). So, I bought Origin of Symmetry as soon as it came out (at the import price!) and was a little shocked to finally find out that this huge sound (think Queen/Boston) was created by a three-piece.<BR> Origin of Symmetry is way over the top, but in the best possible way. What better review can I give than to say I can't listen to this CD loud or often enough? Nothing has ever had me sing along to my Walkman in public like this one. Each song on Origin is completely different from the last; some songs don't even have guitars on them. The more you hear it, the more you'll realize they are geniuses. Buy it, and turn it way, way up.
B000002AP1|3.0|I had the first CD issue of this album and I was disappointed with the sound, so when I heard their was a remix coming out done by Iggy himself, I traded away my original and ran out to get this one.  Now, I wish I had kept the other one.  This remix is way too distorted.  I can barely bring myself to listen to it.  What a shame because it is truly one of the great punk albums of all time.  I think that the remix could have been great if it wasn't mixed so hot.
0446677450|5.0|The story of little Robbie growing up is dull, pandering, paternalistic, and often outright boring, however the advise Kiyosaki gives is startlingly bright. I found myself scanning past most of the &quot;story&quot; to get to the point of each section, but the point was worth it. After reading the book I felt almost as if I had been taken, for the good parts could have been condensed into a short booklet but Robert would never have gotten his sale price for such a small publication. At the same time, the information in this book should be in a large package for it is valuable. If there was a book equivalent to the packaging of software (a small CD in a big splashy box) then it would get close to how this book should be formatted. However, no such thing exists so you will have to wade through some painful prose to discover ideas that could very well change your financial perspective completely.
B00003CXXJ|5.0|I loved this movie in the theater and saw it multiple times, and I still had to own it.  The animation is amazing, and the humor in so many references to Disney, literature, and pop culture is quite clever.  I was delighted to find so many bonus extras packed on this DVD.  It's always a nice surprise to get more for your money!
B00002SSRZ|1.0|One of the all time greats. Someone had their head you know where when they mixed the DTS version. Dont spend the money on this one. The remastered version is the one your should buy. that said, the sound quality isn't all that bad except the fool who remixed this lost any kind of real bass response. Frankly i'm suprised that DTS even let this one out. I know they know better.
B00005NOOH|5.0|This is the best documentary of the Second World War available.  The boxed set covers every theatre of war in detail, using retouched footage and interviews with protagonists (everyone from Lord Mountbatten to Hitler's secretary) to make WWII as vivid to viewers as if it was the Gulf War.  Years 1939 to 1941 should make interesting watching for US viewers, as you weren't there!  Better late than never though, so catch up with what was going on in Europe while you were sitting at home twiddling your thumbs (only joking!).  Seriously, buy it and wind your partner up like crazy with the distinctively sombre intro music.  The special section on Auschwitz is chilling, particularly the guards' accounts of the genocide.  It should be part of every High School syllabus.  6 out of 5.

0385505833|4.0|I've never read any of Grisham's other novels.  However, it was due to Grisham's &quot;bankable&quot; name (as one reviewer pointed out) that I even noticed this book at all.  The story is very well written and the characters' ideosyncracies add a touch of realism.  The main character's frustrations about Christmas and the cost it involves ring a bell.  (I would love to &quot;skip&quot; a christmas.)  When I read this book, I somehow felt as if it were one of O Henry's short stories.  Maybe it's just me.  But if you want a quick escape for a few hours on some light reading, then this is a good book for you.<br />On another level, I'm not sure if this novel tries to teach a lesson (if at all).  I'm Catholic, and to me, it's trying to say that if I were to pause and reflect a while I'd have realized that a lot of what we do in the name of tradition has no connection to the birth of Christ 2000 years ago.  Or maybe this novel has a motivational purpose.  It tells you to treat your neighbors (people all around you) right because you never know when you'll need their help.
0792156684|5.0|I bet that if Amazon.com had been around in 1939, you could have gone to the &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot; page and read reviews that were just as bad as some of those found here.  But, don't be fooled.  &quot;GWTW&quot; turned out to be a classic, and &quot;Titanic&quot; will, too.<br />&quot;Titanic&quot; is essentially two interconnected movies.  The first, or course, follows the historic accounts of the maiden voyage of the RMS Titanic and its tragic sinking due to the combination of neglectful overconfidence from her crew and a well-placed iceberg.  The second film concerns the events surrounding a pair of fictional star-crossed lovers who meet aboard the doomed ship.<br />The historical aspects of the movie are unparalleled.  Cameron did his homework on this part of the film, even going so far as to dive and film on the actual wreck in the North Atlantic.  All of the well-known figures are shown - The proud Captain Smith, the self-centered Bruce Ismay, head of the White Star Line, the tragic Thomas Andrews, the ship's designer aboard for the maiden voyage, the fiery Molly Brown, played wonderfully by Kathy Bates, John Astor, richest man aboard the ship, the tragic First Officer Murdoch (did he really shoot himself?  An unsolved historical mystery) plus a host of other minor characters.  Cameron makes use of examinations of the wreck to recreate the impact with the berg and the sinking itself in precise detail.  Anyone who says that this film is not historcially accurate does not know what they are talking about.<br />The romance between star-crossed lovers Jack Dawson and Rose Dewitt-Bukater is the standard doomed romance that filmmakers always seem to feel they have to insert into history-based films in order to get more people in the door.  I thought that both DiCaprio and Winslet turned in decent performances, if not worthy of best-actor/actress nominations.  People have taken James Cameron to task becuase he did not write them a bunch of super-deep, Bogart-Bacall dialogue.  Well, how much deep dialogue are you supposed to expect from a vagabond teenage punk kid and a spoiled-brat rich girl marrying a guy she doesn't love?  Anyone expecting deep dialogue from a pair of teenagers has clearly never been around REAL teens.  People say that DiCaprio and Winslet turned in stereotypical, shallow performances, but I think they captured the behavior of 95% of real teens perfectly.  Jack Dawson acted like any other teen would who suddenly captured the eye of a good-looking rich girl, and Rose acted like any spoiled, pampered little rich girl just waiting for an excuse to rebel against her overbearing mother.  I cheered for her when she told her mother off just before she boarded the lifeboat.  Both of them acted like typcial teens experiencing their first love affair.  If both of them had survived, the relationship probably would not have lasted more than six months, tops.  <br />There were several other minor characters involved in the film, and I enjoyed them all.  I thought Billy Zane had a good time chewing the scenery as the typical love-to-hate-him bad guy.  David Warner was also excellent as the sinister assistant/accomplice to Zane's scheming.  <br />Overall, this is a magnificent movie.  Anyone who can sit through the sequence where the band plays &quot;Nearer my God to Thee&quot; just before the sinking without being moved emotionally has something missing inside.  The mother reading her two kids to sleep, knowing they will soon be dead, and the two old people embracing on their bed as the water flows into their room, are two images that will stay with me forever, even if I never see this film again.  Cameron does an excellent job of creating a snapshot of life in 1912, and makes us truly care about the characters, most of whom will meet tragic ends in the frigid waters of the North Atlantic.  This movie is one for the ages.  No question about it.
B00003CXXJ|5.0|\\"Shrek\\" was really a big surpise for me in theatres. I really had no interest in seeing the film, until the good reviews poured in. I went to go see it, and it turned out to be a perfect combination of wonderful animation, terrific vioce-overs, comic brilliance, and a creative story.<br />While the film offers animation that puts everything from Pixar to shame, the thing that shines through the most in this production is the cast, most notably Eddie Murphy as Donkey. Mike Myers was hilarious as Shrek, but the accent couldn't make me stop picturing his Fat ... character from \\"Austin Powers II\\".<br />The DVD presents a fine presentation of the film, better then it was in theatres. While it is one of the top 3 DVDs of the year, there is some room for improvement. When it was announced that 'Shrek' would contain 11 hours of extra's, I wanted to label it right away the best DVD of 2001. I'm glad I didn't. The behind the scenes doc, audio commentary, and a few other extras (including great menus) do give big points to the Discs, but the rest of the 11 hours seem to be games, or other extra that do not provide insight to the movie and where just placed there to take up remaining room.<br />All and all, \\"Shrek\\" still remains as one of the top 3 Must buy DVDs of the year!
6305313687|4.0|I was eager to see this film before it got released, simply by virtue of the fact that Edward Norton was going to star, and the extremely sensitive nature of the film (given it's subject matter).<br />I wasn't disappointed--and it's easy to see why this film wasn't nominated for more academy awards (the politics of it made it impossible to win); we're admiring this film by the performances within.  Edward Furlong is negligible as always, but Beverly D'Angelo does an underrated turn as the Vinyards' widowed mother, and Steacy Keach (previously blackballed in Hollywood due to an earlier high-publicity cocaine bust) is very effective as the leader of the white supremacist organization.<br />The film is uncompromising in it's violence--some might say it's gratuitous or simply too visceral--but the choice to shoot its flashback scenes in black and white is brilliant, not just for the symbolism, but also for the starkness of each actor's performance.<br />Avery Brooks is himself; no more, no less, but that's fine, because Edward Norton is the real attraction of this film.  I wouldn't say it's his best performance, but it was certainly worthy of an academy award nomination.
B00002Z88D|5.0|There really isn't much else to be said about this 2 CD Metallica-fest combined with the San Francisco Symphony besides to get it NOW.  If you're new to Metallica, this cd is for your because they play music that ranges from almost all of their cds(besides Kill 'Em All :(  Combined with the symphony, Metallica sound powerful and as good as ever, however, the James' vocals are noticeably aging.  This is THE Metallica beginner CD to get if you're new to the group.  Although I think the track selection could have better, this CD is as good as Metallica gets.
B00000K0DQ|5.0|In a world in which debatable and misunderstood subjects can be listed endlessly, this powerful 1995 film takes on one at the top of that list; moreover, it does it objectively and realistically, and with a sensibility and sensitivity that makes it a truly great film by anyone's measuring stick.  And to add some irony to it all, even the subject matter of this film has been widely misunderstood, as it is wrongly perceived that this is a film about the pros and cons of the death penalty; it is not.  At the heart of \\"Dead Man Walking,\\" directed by Tim Robbins, is a subject that in reality is possibly the most misunderstood of all, and with good reason, because it just may be the hardest thing there is for a human being to really-- and truly-- understand.  And it is what this film is actually all about:  Forgiveness.  Real forgiveness; not excusing a heinous crime or the perpetrator thereof-- not saying that what's happened is okay-- but finding the strength to go on, and to do so by choosing life.<br /> Director/screenwriter Tim Robbins has crafted and delivered a faithful adaptation of the novel by Sister Helen Prejean, in which she discusses her involvement with the death-row inmates to whom over the years she has ministered her faith in God.  As chronicled in the film, what for her was to become a lifelong pursuit of not only justice, but human dignity, began with a simple letter from a death-row inmate at the Louisiana State Prison at Angola.  Sentenced to death for rape and murder, Matthew Poncelet (Sean Penn) was reaching out to anyone who would listen, when his letter ended up in the hands of Sister Prejean (Susan Sarandon), who soon found herself venturing into a territory of which she had absolutely no knowledge or experience.  And Robbins has successfully captured Sister Prejean's emotional and turbulent journey succinctly, while managing to keep it devoid of any maudlin sentimentality, which makes it not only real, credible and believable, but makes it a poignant and thoroughly emotionally involving experience for the audience.  Through the medium of the cinema, what was once a personal, significant emotional experience for Sister Prejean, becomes one for everyone who sees this film, as well.<br /> For her soul-stirring, impassioned portrayal of Sister Prejean, Susan Sarandon deservedly won the Oscar for Best Actress.  Sensitive and fraught with emotional depth, her performance is incredibly touching and real, especially in the way in which she conveys Sister Prejean's underlying natural fragility and vulnerability, which she adamantly tempered with the toughness she needed to carry on with her endeavors on behalf of Poncelet (and in reality, a total of five since she began).  Whatever your point of view regarding the matters examined in this film, Sister Prejean is without question an individual of heroic proportions, which Sarandon exquisitely personifies here; and she does it without resorting to any superfluous melodramatics, but rather by keeping it real, by subtly and humbly exploring the humanity of the person in a very believable expression of characterization.  It's an extraordinary performance, arguably the best of Sarandon's brilliant career. <br /> Turning in a career-best performance, as well, is Sean Penn, who was nominated for Best Actor for his portrayal of Poncelet (he lost out to Nicolas Cage, who won for his performance in \\"Leaving Las Vegas).  Perfect for the part in every way, Penn has quite simply never been better, before or since.  He effectively presents Poncelet as a real person, rather than as an overblown caricature of a monster capable of perpetrating the crimes depicted here.  Not that it makes Poncelet any less despicable; just the opposite, in fact.  It makes it genuinely disconcerting to be faced with the fact that someone who looks like a guy who could live next door to you could be capable of such things.  And that's the strength of Penn's performance-- it's so disturbingly real, presented with depth and nuance; you have but to look into his eyes to find the imperfections of a troubled soul.  A terrific performance, and -- as good as Cage was in \\"Vegas\\"-- Penn should have received the Oscar for it.<br /> In another stand-out performance, Raymond J. Barry is memorable in a supporting role as Earl Delacroix, father of one of Poncelet's victims.  With limited screen time, he nevertheless develops his character in such a way that enables you to empathize with him, as well as with Sister Prejean, as it is through him that we are given some insight into just how complex and seemingly tenuous her position is, at least on the surface.  Barry presents Delacroix in such a way that gives the necessary balance and perspective to the story, which is ultimately extremely effective and helps to underscore the message of the film.<br /> The supporting cast includes R. Lee Emery (Clyde Percy), Celia Weston (Mary Beth Percy), Lois Smith (Helen's Mother), Scott Wilson (Chaplin Farley), Roberta Maxwell (Lucille Poncelet), Margo Martindale (Sister Colleen) and Jack Black (Craig Poncelet).  It is doubtful that this film will change anyone's mind one way or another about the death penalty, but that was never the intention; what was intended, was to make a thought-provoking, emotionally involving film, which is exactly what Robbins has accomplished with \\"Dead Man Walking.\\"  Regardless of your personal point of view, this film will have an impact, and hopefully will open some minds to the true nature of forgiveness.  For, as we see through the character of Earl Delacroix, true forgiveness is not something one merely decides to do, but is a task that can become a lifetime's work.  And it's possibly one of the hardest things in life to effectively accomplish; and you come away from this film with an appreciation for individuals like Sister Prejean, who has selflessly dedicated her life to helping those in need, and to filmmakers like Robbins and Sarandon for bringing herto life for millions of people who otherwise would never have known her.
0953104907|5.0|This is one of the best &quot;how to&quot; books of any sort which I have ever read. Mr. Hiscock writes at a level which is appropriate for beginning woodworkers, but not boring or condescending to more experienced craftsmen. If you have any desire to build your own guitar buy this book before any other.
0345438205|2.0|Midway through Childhood's End (one of Clarke's best books), there is a chapter that summarises the change of human culture from present state (cold war, dark ages) to utopia (peace, atheism).  It's a quick transitional chapter (maybe 10 pages in the middle of the book) that serves to make a millenial leap in the narrative and gets the reader ready for the next part of the story--the really good part. <br />If you took that one chapter, fleshed it out so it's about 200 pages and slapped a monolith on the book cover, you'd have 3001: The Final Odyssey. Unfortunately, while Childhood's End had a powerful evocative story to get on with, there's almost no story here and certainly no really good part.<br />Taken on it's own, 3001 is an interesting little fiction of what life might be like in the next millennium. The first half of the book takes a visitor from the year 2001 (Frank Poole, from the first book &amp; movie) on a tour through life of the thirtieth century. Here Arthur does a good job of fulfilling his role in writing razzle-dazzle engineering fiction. The descriptions of life in the future are breathtaking. <br />Taking a change from a lot of his work, though, Clarke is not happy with just writing compelling spacescapes. He spends a lot of time criticizing the 20th century: putting our current prison system, using female genital mutation as an example of life during our dark ages.  Clarke takes a lot of swings at what he sees as the root of almost all of our problems--organised religion--and offers us the religion of Science. Science, the way Clarke describes it, is practised devoutly in the thirtieth century and has solved all of the problems that religion has caused.  Frank Poole, being an astronaut and a Clarkian Protagonist, puts up no defense for the near-barbaric times he was born in and comes to believe that life in 2001 is as squalid and barbaric as those from 3001 think it is. If this is your kind of thing, go to it and good luck!<br />As the final chapter in the &quot;Odyssey Quartet&quot;, however, this book leaves so much to be desired. Being spoiler free, I'll say that there are two pervasive problems: massive inconsistencies with earlier books (both in size and frequency), and lack of scope.<br />While Clarke felt a need to update the science from 1965, many of the inconsistencies (especially the ones dealing with HAL, Dave Bowman, and the beings responsible for monoliths) are unnecessary. Worse, they rob the book of much of the charm, solemnity, and wonder that earlier installations had. Many of the inconsistencies are done to simplify what little story there is and accentuate the preaching described above.  A catalog of all the gaffes (most of which Clarke himself acknowledges) would be very long and lend itself to spoilers. Suffice it to say that science that worked in 2001 doesn't work in 3001, characters that made a great impact in 2061 never happened in 3001, events that happened one way in the first three books happened a completly different way within the context of this book.<br />As for scope, the book was a half-day's read. Unlike the 4 million-year journey of the first book, or the interplanetary exploration in the first two, all of the conflict/action takes place in the last 20 pages and there is never any doubt of what will happen.  <br />The book has all the drama and conflict of a travel brocheure.  Which is pretty accurate because at this point it seems like Clarke would rather espouse the virtues of Science then tell a good story.  In case you missed things, though, Arthur adds 15 pages of notations for you; most of which focus on what he predicted accurately, and what he thinks should be our focus as a race.  When you're done, all questions are answered and everything is explained for the reader (who, one imagines, is expected to write to their congresspeople demanding that sceintists get the grants they need to bring 3001 about). <br />Clarke's best works (City and the Stars, 2001, 2010,Rendezvous With Rama, Childhood's End) tell great stories and leave the preaching (such as it is) to marginalia. 3001 has replaced wonder with the dogma of scientific reason; the story is tossed in almost as an afterthought.
0679892478|4.0|How many apples can you place on top of your head...one, two, three?  This book is really fun.  As a child I remember counting the apples &quot;up on top&quot; of the characters heads.  With each turn of the page a new and more outrageous event takes place as well as the addition of more &quot;apples up on top&quot;.  My girls listen attentively through the entire book and love the conclusion each time we read it.
0345350499|5.0|I am at times prone to exaggeration.  However, I am serious in saying this is the book that changed my life.  I have, to date, read it three times... and I plan many more return trips to Avalon in the future.  When I first read it, it spoke to me both as a fan of the fantasy genre in general (and of the Arthurian legends in particular), and as a pagan.  As a female fantasy fan, it was refreshing to FINALLY see the story of Camelot told from the points of view of a few of the many women crucial to the legends.  As a pagan, it was incredible to read a novel which was very even-handed in its treatment of differing religious viewpoints.  In nearly all other accounts of the Arthurian cycle, the Christians are treated as the heroes and the Pagans as evil.  Marion Zimmer Bradley, however, treats people of both faiths as exactly what they were (and are); people, both good and bad, well-meaning and ill-intentioned.  Bradley approached the religious aspects with an open mind, and the end result is a novel which is not only an engrossing read but also educational.  Be prepared to be completely swept up in the world of Avalon and of the strong and complicated character of Morgaine le Fey.  If there was any possible way I could give this book more than 5 stars, I would.  The Mists of Avalon is, without a doubt, at the top of my list of the best novels ever written.
B00005QDW5|1.0|As with majority of the songs on this album they should be heard in the context of the album for which they were created...Buy Dark Side, The Wall...etc. Don't waste your time on a record of singles from a band that didn't intend them as such (at least as Roger Waters intended...not David Gilmour)
B00000G3AZ|4.0|Romance is in the air and love is in bloom in Victorian era England, in this light-hearted story set against a society in a time in which manners were still in vogue, the ladies were charming and elegant, and the gentlemen dashing.  \\"Emma,\\" based on the novel by Jane Austen and written for the screen and directed by Douglas McGrath, stars the lovely Gwyneth Paltrow in the title role.  A self-appointed matchmaker, Emma takes great delight in the romantic notion of playing Cupid and attempting to pair up those she feels are suited to one another.  Coming off a successful matching that ended in marriage, she next sets her sights on finding a mate for her friend, Harriet (Toni Collette), but the outcome of her initial attempt proves to be less than satisfying.  Meanwhile, her endeavors are tempered by by the handsome Mr. Knightley (Jeremy Northam), whose insights into matters of the heart often seem to be a bit more astute than Emma's, and lend some needed balance to the proceedings.  And Emma, so concerned with what is right for others, neglects the heart that is actually the most important of all:  Her own.  The world goes `round and love abounds, but Emma is about to miss the boat.  Luckily for her, however, the is someone just right for her waiting in the wings.  Now, if she can but stop long enough to realize it.  But as everyone who has known true love knows, matters of the heart can go right or wrong in an instant, depending upon the slightest thing; and while romance is at hand for Emma, she must first recognize it, and seize the moment.<br /> McGrath has crafted and delivered a delightful, feel-good film that is like a breath of fresh air in our often turbulent world.  There may be an air of frivolity about it, but in retrospect, this story deals with something that is perhaps the most important thing there is-- in all honesty-- to just about anyone:  Love.  And with McGrath's impeccable sense of pace and timing, it all plays out here in a way that is entirelyentertaining and enjoyable.  It's a pleasant, affecting film, with a wonderful cast, that successfully transports the viewer to another time and another place.  It's light fare, but absorbing; and the picturesque settings and proceedings offer a sense of well-being and calm that allows you to immerse yourself in it and simply go with the flow.<br /> The winsome Paltrow, who won the Oscar for best actress for \\"Shakespeare In Love\\" two years after making this one, seems comfortable and right at home in this genre.  She personifies all things British, and does it with such naturalness and facility that it's the kind of performance that is easily taken for granted or overlooked altogether.  She's simply so good at what she does and makes it look so easy.  She has a charismatic screen presence and an endearing manner, very reminiscent of Audrey Hepburn.  Yet Paltrow is unique.  As an actor, she has a wide range and style and has demonstrated-- with such films as \\"Hard Eight,\\" \\"Hush\\" and \\"A Perfect Murder\\"-- that she can play just about any part effectively, and with that personal touch that makes any role she plays her own.  But it's with characters like Emma that she really shines.  She is so expressive and open, and her personality is so engaging, that she is someone to whom it is easy to relate and just a joy to watch, regardless of the part she is playing.  And for Emma, she is absolutely perfect.<br /> Jeremy Northam also acquits himself extremely well in the role of Knightley, and like Paltrow, seems suited to the genre-- in the right role, that is; his performance in the more recent \\"The Golden Bowl,\\" in which he played an Italian Prince, was less than satisfying.  Here, however, he is perfect; he is handsome, and carries himself in such a way that makes Knightley believable and very real.  Like Colin Firth's Mr. Darcy in the miniseries \\"Pride and Prejudice,\\" Northam has created a memorable character with his own Mr. Knightley.<br /> Also excellent in supporting roles and worthy of mention are Toni Collette, as Emma's friend Harriet Smith; and Alan Cumming, as the Reverend Elton.  Respectively, Collette and Cumming create characters who are very real people, and as such become a vital asset to the overall success of this film.  And it demonstrates just how invaluable the supporting players are in the world of the cinema, and to films of any genre.<br /> The supporting cast includes Greta Scacchi (Mrs. Weston), Denys Hawthorne (Mr. Woodhouse), Sophie Thompson (Miss Bates), Kathleen Byron (Mrs. Goddard), Phyllida Law (Mrs. Bates), Polly Walker (Jane Fairfax) and Ewan McGregor (Frank Churchill).  An uplifting, elegant film, \\"Emma\\" is a reminder of civilized behavior and the value of gentleness and grace in a world too often beset with unpleasantness.  And even if it's only through the magic of the silver screen, it's nice to be able to escape to such a world as this, if only for a couple of hours, as it fulfills the need for that renewal of faith in the human spirit.  And that's the magic of the movies.

B00005M989|2.0|As fan of Prince I was not excited about this hits copilation. First of all this would not be a greatest hits album in the first place especially one CD covering 2 decades of countless hits. Many of the songs on here were,nt even hits. I have never even heard of Alphabet St. and another big flaw to this album is that it did not include material from the post-Diamonds and Pearls material. This album is good but this should only be for the completists. This ones worth passing up. Go and get his 3 CD Hits and B-Sides collection instead even if it means shelling out over 50 dollars. At least we have Rainbow Children to look forward to.
0811833887|4.0|In recent years everytime a major animated film, particularly those associated with Disney, is released a flood of products overwhelms the consumer market.  This is not however your typical 'making of' or 'behind the scenes' look at &quot;Monsters Inc.&quot;.  I'm certain that if it is not already out there it will soon follow if that is what you're looking for.  This book is unique, especially since the movie is 3-D rendered computer animation, because it is not filled with wire-frames, and storyboards, and studio character layouts.  This book is more about inspiration.  The vast amount of illustrations are beautiful, whimsical, and as varied as the imagination itself.  I thouroughly enjoyed this book as a lover of cartoons, of paintings, of drawings, and of monsters of all kinds.  I highly reccomend it to children of all ages and art lovers everywhere.
B000003TB6|5.0|This is by far THE best recording made by the Roots. After listening to this for the past 7 years it is as fresh today as it was the day it was released. Of all of their albums released this is the truest quintessential hip-hop/ jazz record. You won't hear many samples or other forms of inorganic sound on this cd. This music is 100%. Made from scratch. Lyrically this record shines with prose so def it will make your head spin. The roots can often sping whack tongue twister rhymes that are so hard core and original you can't mimic their style or even try to get their flow down. I have ALL of their albums and this is the $hit people. Get it.

He said:&quot; if u want to know the greatest bass player of all time, if u want to listen the best album about using a bass, buy the first Jaco Pastorius album.&quot; I bought it. No words can descrive how small that i felt in the moment the first time that Portray of Tracy played on my stereo. No one can have. I think nothing is the same before Jaco.

0385505833|1.0|This is one of the most irritating books I have ever read. It is completely without artistry, totally predictable, and packed with the kind of characters that make life in America seem hopeless and embarrassing.<br />It is a depressing and shallow book.

B00004XQP4|5.0|All of you people saying &quot; Green Day has lost its edge,&quot; are right it is more folked up if you will than their other albums. But it still kicks a$$ so kiss my a$$.  The band has admitted to it being diff. and that it was a nice ver from what they usual do, which they do plan on going back too, form what I have heard them say.  Just cause they use an accustic doesnt make it &quot;folk,&quot; as for the guy that said &quot;Waiting is annoying&quot; I thought this at first too, but now I think it is one of the best songs on this album.  This album does take longer to grow on you than their other albums, but once you give it a chance you'll agree with me.  Dookie and 1039 SOSH are still better than this one though.
0679731725|5.0|The Remains of the Day by Kazuo Ishiguro. Highly recommended.<br />It's difficult to believe how much Kazuo Ishiguro packed into this short (by today's standards), highly praised novel -- a lifetime of work and relationships, the realization of inescapable regret, and the hope it is not too late to join the rest of humanity.<br />Stevens is a butler for an English house that is no longer great, nor is it owned by the family for which it is named. His postwar employer is, instead, an American named Farraday; as a stranger will point out to him later, &quot;An American? Well, they're the only ones can afford it now.&quot; Farraday &quot;affords&quot; Darlington Hall by shutting much of the house down and using a reduced staff, which Stevens can understand, as the staff that would be available would not be up to his own high standards. When he receives a sad, lonely letter from Darlington's former housekeeper, Miss Kenton (now Mrs. Benn), and later is told by Farraday that he can borrow his employer's car for a vacation on the road, he weighs the opportunity and decides to take it for &quot;professional reasons&quot; -- to see if he can lure back the highly qualified Miss Kenton to her former position. During the brief journey, he spends much of his time contemplating what &quot;dignity&quot; in his profession means -- and whether he lived up to it. After a plethora of recollections about the late Lord Darlington during the prewar years and after his meeting with Miss Kenton, Stevens comes to two great understandings: he did not serve a great man as he thought he had, and, in doing so, he had missed a chance for love and fulfillment. His devotion to Lord Darlington has betrayed him, personally and professionally. &quot;I can't even say I made my own mistakes,&quot; he laments. &quot;Really -- one has to say -- what dignity is there in that?&quot;<br />This revelation does not come quickly or easily to either Stevens or the reader. Each anecdote that Stevens recalls to illustrate a point he wishes to make to himself -- the definition of dignity, how he upheld dignity by serving his employer while his own father lay dying -- subtly reveals how much he has shut himself down emotionally in order to serve. With each story, it becomes clearer that Lord Darlingon is an easily manipulated man, out of his league in world politics but insistent on playing the role of peacemaker -- even when it is no longer appropriate or wise. When his friendship with a woman leads him to firing two Jewish maids, it foreshadows his attempts to influence the British government into appeasing Hitler and the Nazis at any cost. He goes so far as to say that the U.K. should perhaps follow Germany's lead. &quot;Germany and Italy have set their houses in order by acting . . . See what strong leadership can do if it's allowed to act. None of this universal suffrage nonsense.&quot; Stevens unwittingly proves Lord Darlington's point for him -- he trusts Lord Darlington's judgment as blindly as any German trusted Hitler's, believing that &quot;people like him&quot; are too ignorant to make the decisions that must be made and following the great man contentedly -- and thus making a bad decision.<br />When it comes to Miss Kenton, here too his perception is kept in check by his need for professionalism and dignity. His repeated emphasis on their &quot;professional&quot; relationship and his desire to reconnect with her as a &quot;professional&quot; only highlight the extent to which he will go to suppress his real feelings -- and the very real possibilities that existed.<br />In life and love, Stevens realises he has been avoiding both. In the end, however, there is hope. After sending Miss Kenton home, back to her husband, Stevens turns to &quot;bantering&quot;; that is, engaging with people without resorting to pre-programmed professional phrases --in short, truly interacting with his fellow humans. &quot;After all, when one thinks about it, it is not such a foolishthing to indulge in -- particularly if it is the case that in bantering lies the key to human warmth.&quot; Indeed it does.<br />One doesn't have to be a butler in service to others to use the remains of his or her own day to look back and appraise where one went wrong and where there is still room for hope. This is an incredible journey toward understanding, written in a concise, spare manner that fits perfectly with the character of Stevens. Few writers have the gift of saying so much in so little space. More should learn it.<br />Diane L.

B00003CXSP|5.0|Ridley Scott's Hannibal in my opinion is just as good as the first one. Ridlet Scott blends hunting images with extremely graphic violence which in my opinion works very well together. I like how they show you the evil of Hannibal Lector. I think that was good the first one should you his good side this one shows his bad side. This film should have got the NC-17 rating for violence its one of the most violent films ever made.<BR> <BR> WARNING: This film contains Extremely Graphic Prolonged Groesome violence and Graphic Cannablism.
B000001LKY|5.0|In my opinion, this is THE Hawkwind classic album. At 15 when I first heard it on my Dads contemporary lo-fi it sounded magnificent. Waves of synth/melletron droning guitars and fantastic rythym section. Lemmy's last appearance. All this combined with spacey Moorcock poetry, what a blast. North Berwick, Scotland was never the same. The only let down being the last track Motorhead, which still sounds out of place. Opa Loka , Magnu and Assault and Batteries more than compensate, and I guess also show the way Mr Killiminster was headed.
B00005NWM3|5.0|I recently purchased this CD and was totally blown away with the songs on the album. From the opening track &quot;Never Again&quot; to the their big hit &quot;How You Remind Me&quot; this CD is not stop rock. Chad Kroeger's vocals backed by very strong guitar riffs make this a must buy. These guys show on this album that they can belt out the melodic rock or go easy on a ballad too.  I had all but given up on any kind of heavy metal but Nickelback has renewed my faith totally. If you like Staind and are a fan of heavy metal then I recommend this CD to you.
B00003CXXJ|1.0|i realize that millions of people love this movie, but i really didn't like it.  i found it to be painfully self-aware and distressingly heavy on cynical, post-modern &quot;cleverness&quot;.  and, frankly, i wasn't that impressed by the animation.  sure, there were some funny bits here and there, but on the whole i found the film to be annoying and off-putting.  i'm sure this puts me in a very small minority, but i guess it just goes to show that you can't please everyone...
B00003CWTH|3.0|I couldn't recommend anyone away from MAGNOLIA simply because it's worth seeing John C. Reilly's superb performance as a messed-up cop and William H. Macy's equally fine performance as a former child genius. There's other strong work from some other actors as well, but Anderson just isn't able to pull the whole thing off. It's too loose and disconnected: there are many things in it that might've seemed intelligent on paper or in discussion with his friends (the lipsynching of a song by several of the characters all at once, the inexplicable miracle at the film's close), but in practice they just lie there flat on the screen, seemingly unrelated to anything else. You keep awiting for a kind of magic to take over and animate the whole (as it does in Altman's NASHVILLE, Anderson's clear model, or even as it does in Anderson's previous movie, BOOGIE NIGHTS), but it just seems a mess at the end.
0140072187|5.0|Being a helicopter pilot myself for the past 6 years, this book has always moved me deeply, thinking about those men, trying to maintain some sort of sanity in a crazy situation. <br />I have had the unfortunate luck, of evacuating wounded soldiers, from a war which is still controversial in my country, but I never faced the kind of situations that Mason discribes in the book, and I have always wandered how they did it, knowing that every morning and evry mission could spell sudden death, from the enemy, or worse, by your commander's stupidity.<br />I think it's a book about bravery, about how these helicopter pilots in Vietnam were willing to risk their lives every day for their fellow soldiers. I believe that flying into combat, surviving it, seeing what might happen if it wasn't your lucky day, then doing it again and again and again, takes a special kind of character. Character shown by Mason.<br />I have read many war books, some about Vietnam, some not. My country is (unfortunately) filled with veterans, including my entire family (my father was also a pilot and my brother was in the special forces, we've all been through combat). I think this book is special in the way it touches you intimately, making you feel, just as if you were hearing the story from the author in person. <br />This is not about victory or defeat, this is about something else, and to know what this thing is you must read the book and look inside to see the impact it has on you.
B00005LOUS|5.0|I just have to say that after reading the other reviews posted here I felt someone should take up for this movie.  I took my children to see it and we all absolutely loved it.  I don't think there is another person alive that could have done a better job at being &quot;the grinch&quot;  Jim Carrey was awesome.  I just can't wait to purchase my own tape.  It will be one Christmas movie that will be played over and over every year along with my other favorites.
B00003CY0U|2.0|At the beginning of this film, John Travolta's character talks about &quot;Dog Day Afternoon.&quot;  If you haven't seen this Sidney Lumet classic about bank robbery, watch it first because it delivers 1000 times better viewing experience.  Oh, by the way, he talks about the lack of reality in recent Hollywood movies.  You can find that in &quot;Dog Day Afternoon,&quot; too.<br />To be fair, &quot;Swordfish&quot; is an action-packed movie, so it certainly gives many action scenes.  But how?  Of course, blowing a bomb, shooting the scene with the 360 degree &quot;time-slice&quot; camerawork which is, to old moviegoers like me, only a recycled idea of the much superb &quot;Matrix.&quot;  (And it was produced by Joel Silver, the same as &quot;Swordfish.&quot;  Surprise!) <br />Well, I know we need a certain degree of suspending disbelief, but &quot;Swordfish&quot; handles potentially very serious matter so carelessly that even its praised opening scenes only leave a nasty taste in your mouth.  And though I am not a devoted PC believer, Halle Berry's character, who exists just to bare breasts, looks as if she exists to show how to waste a good talent in Hollywood.  Anyone who have seen her in &quot;Losing Isaiah&quot; (fine work, indeed) should know she can really act much better than in this terrible mess.<br />Though I admit that stunt people are doing great jobs, and Hugh Jackman proves that he is one of the talented young actors of his generation with his good acting, their works are put aside for the sake of big explosions, meaningless nudity, and the awfully bad haircut of John Travolta.  And someone tell me, what is Sam Shepard doing in it?<br />This is basically a forgettable movie, but that doesn't matter.  I understand there are many people who are willing to defend this film on the ground that it is just a fun; they could enjoy it, and saying don't be serious.  I'm not.  I just want to point out that there are many other by far better films out there (how about &quot;Speed&quot;?) and with all respect to those who are involved in this movie, we movie fans know that John Travolta, Hugh Jackman, and especailly Don Cheadle are all wasting their precious talent.  (Just think, how directors like Quention Tarantino would make a movie with this fabulous cast?) Surely &quot;Swordfish&quot; is better than &quot;Battlefield Earth,&quot; but that doesn't mean much.
B0000027D5|5.0|This album comes from a 1973 tour of Japan to support the Caravanserai album.  It was originally released in 1974 only in Japan.  It was a 3 LP set with some nice oddly shaped fold out posters.  If you wanted it, you had to buy the Japanese import at a very steep price.  It now comes in reasonably priced CD.  On most versions of the CD, the artwork is intact but shrunk to CD dimensions.<br />The Santana band was in transition.  Greg Rollie and Neal Schon had left to form Journey.  The group's sound had changed to a much richer, and deeper sound. Instead of being &quot;lighter&quot;, more accesible Latin sound with pop type vocals, it was now a darker, multi layered sound, with any vocals being in the background.<br />For the tour, the group played a style that was a mixture between the styles of Abraxas and Caravanserai.  The music is a little brighter than Caravanserai, but it is very intense and high energy.  They just start playing and don't stop.   Incident at Neshabar is an incredible, exhausting 16 minutes.  The finale of Toussaint L'Overture will leave your head spinning.  For this tour, they bring along Leon Thomas for vocals, but he doesn't have much to do.<br />I saw Santana in Tucson during this tour, shortly after this album was recorded.  By then, they became completely unaccessable to the audience.  They played in front a big, tilted mirror, so you got an enlarged view of their backs.  They just got up and played.  They did not talk to the audience at all.  In addition, they dropped all the hits from their setlist.  People in the audience started spreading a rumor that Carlos Santana wasn't even with the group on stage.  In spite of the group's aloofness, it was a fantastic show.   Weather Report was the opening band.  As always, Santana brought out the members of the opening band to jam on the encore.
B000050XEI|5.0|I have never heard of Enya before this latest CD, and I can tell you that it knocked me off my feet, especially &quot;Only Time.&quot;  I have played and played the CD so many times that I'm beginning to wonder if I'm going to wear it out.  I originally bought her CD entitled &quot;Paint the Sky with Stars&quot;, thinking &quot;Only Time&quot; was on that, but was mistaken, and I believe ALL her music has such a powerful meaning.  Just an incredible artist whom I will always follow.
B00000IB4D|5.0|This a wonderful Latin influenced jazz album.  It is completely different than any of the other Santana band albums.  It has very unique sounds and is played with high energy. His version of Herbie Mann's Mother Africa is amazing.  There is a great 11 minute duet with jazz/fusion guitarist John MacLaughlin. <br />Although When I Look Into Your Eyes was the one &quot;hit&quot; from this album, I thought is was the weakest track.  I much prefer the song Love, Surrender and Devotion with vocals by Flora Purim. <br />This is the Santana Band's fifth official album.  Carlos Santana had a duet album with Buddy Miles, but it contained most of the Santana band.  Carlos also had a duet album with John MacLaughlin that had some members of the Santana band.  So, it is really Santana's seventh album.  This is the &quot;new Santana band&quot;.  It is mostly the same band as on Caravanserai, except that Greg Rollie and Neal Schon had left to form Journey.  It is mostly the same band as on Lotus.<br />After Caravanserai, Santana went off the deep end with drugs.  It was rumored (but not true) that Santana was institutionalized and wasn't even touring with the band.  He straightened himself out by getting into Indian mysticism and started following a guru named Sri Chimnoy, who had a big following with jazz musicians. He cut his hair short and added Devadip to the beginning of his name.  He really got into jazz, putting out a jazz solo album and two duet albums, one with MacLaughlin and the other with Alice Coltrane.  By 1975, he switched back to his oldself, grew his hair, dropped the Devadip and reintroduced himself to drugs.<br />There are only three songs on this album.  The rest are instrumentals.  When I Look Into Your Eyes is the only track that comes close to the old Santana sound.  If you like the old Santana or the new Santana, but aren't into experimental jazz fusion, you probably won't like this album.

B00005QDW5|4.0|Pink Floyd is one of the rare few classic rock bands that I can actually enjoy listening to. I am more of the casual fan nevertheless I have always liked their music since high school. With all the albums that Pink Floyd has done in a 20-30 year career span, it was inevitable that there would be a best of compilation that consisted mostly of the band's more familiar tunes. Of course one disc wasn't going to be acceptable judging by the large catalog the band released over the years with and without Syd Barrett and Roger Waters, nor would one disc of the band's best songs would do the band's legacy any justice.<br />The packaging for &quot;Echoes&quot; is excellent. The cd booklet has two different covers, one with the man carrying the briefcase wearing clothes and on the other side he has removed his clothes except for his briefs, along with a few other people in the pic. The songs itself on this cd isn't in chronological order and strangely enough it works. Although I am not familiar with a few of the songs, most of them I am well aware of like &quot;Money&quot;, &quot;Another Brick in the Wall (pt. 2)&quot;, and &quot;Learning to Fly&quot;. In my opinion I think the songs were arranged in this manner was by the  sonic impact of the song. On both discs, the first few tracks are some of the band's slowest songs and from there it slowly builds up to songs like &quot;Keep Talking&quot; and &quot;Learning to Fly&quot; where the momentum is high and then slowly crescends with &quot;Sorrow&quot; and &quot;Wish You Were Here&quot;. Just a theory though. Although nothing beats listening to the entire albums these tracks were taken from, &quot;Echoes&quot; is a choice compilation which was carefully put together by the band.

The train of logic through this movie is non-existent, the character development is non-existent and things blow up for no obvious reason other than that an explosion would be cool. Battle robots have armor you can peel up with your hands. She looks like Lara Croft and is very attractive in this movie, unfortunately she also has as much personality as your average video game character. I love action adventure, stupid comedies, etc. I wasn't looking for Shakespeare here, just some diversion from life for a couple of hours. However, ...you will be seriously disappointed. Don't waste your money.
0792156684|5.0|One of the greatest films ever to come out of the 90s. Maybe one of the best films in history.<br />It stands alone with Dances With Wolves, and Schindler's List as one of the most substantial of all the 90s Oscar winners. <br />If I could give these great films more than 5 stars I would.
B00005QK3W|5.0|The man is back! Full of energy, away from all conventionalities and \\"must-do-this\\" that could take his magic away. He is relaxed as if he felt he has nothing to prove this time.<br />So, he comes back after four years with ... is it his best work of the last twenty years? It probably is! Driving Rain is full of Paul: sounds from the Beatles and the Wings years and his personal career's best moments. And, like he has being doing many years ago, he delivers little diamonds which are hidden in the long song list of his new album. \\"Time Bubble\\" for example, is the kind of Macca song which sounds so simple but runs so deep in my ears, mind and heart.<br />It is good to have you back, Paul!
0140149295|5.0|This book is incredible!  I've already read Hurricane: The Miraculous Journey by J.S. Hirsch, and Lazarus and the Hurricane, but in England it is extremely difficult to find this book, and I had to wait 18 days for the it to me.  It was definately worth the wait.  Being only 16, I don't often enjoy reading, but this story just reels you in and I rarely put it down.  Rubin Carter: what an inspiration!  Read it! It is definately worth it, especially when you think that it was written 30 years ago.
B00004XOWM|2.0|I used to love Limp Bizkit, Korn, Linkin Park, and those nu-metal rap-rock boybands when I started listening to rock music (3 years ago). Right now I'm 16 and my music taste has developed and grew. Right now I'm into alternative and softer rocks. I don't know, if I have to rate this cd when it came out i would give it a 4 stars, but right now 2 stars seemed a little too much...
6305648522|5.0|I had been all my life in love with movies but I should admit that &quot;Cinema Paradiso&quot; is probably one of ten top films I ever saw. And not just for the film factor from which the script grows but for the characters, the losing of inocence, the nostalgia of the good old days, the face of that early love that one never will forget, the passion, the beauty, the music and so on and on and on. Cinema paradiso deserves to appear in golden bold upper case type in the History of Cinema. Unbeatable.
B000002H33|5.0|Master of Puppets is more than just Metallica's best CD, its probably one of the best that Ive ever heard. It has intense lyrics which slap the faces of little rap-rock bands who sing about their whinney problems, and also the most kickass guitar playing ever. You too will think that Kirk Hammet is a god after hearing this CD. <BR>The best thing about Master of Puppets is that its more than just some drink-coaster metal disc. If you like any sort of hard rock, Master of Puppets is a great buy. Why spend your money on a pop cd when you can buy some METALLICA? sure they sound a whole lot different in the 80s then they do now, but seriously... you need this cd. Everyone needs this cd.
B00003CXZ1|1.0|This was absolutely AWFUL.  This movie was played up as being super.  Just the opposite.  The acting was terrible.
B00000IL26|5.0|The most successful of all Lee Morgan's albums. The funky title track &quot;Sidewinder&quot; is alone worth the cost of the CD.<br />Combines a four/four rock drum beat, soul/funk/boogaloo bass line with rapid-fire, close harmony mirror-image Jazz trumpet and tenor sax parts on top. This fusion effort was called a Rock sell-out when it originally was released but it is one of the most consistently listenable Fusion type albums to this day.<br />Other tracks are strong, less funky, more Jazzy. Especially Totem Pole. Lee Morgan spent most of his subsequent life trying to duplicate the success of this album following the same formula, usually with lesser results; a few good tracks and a lot of more forgetable stuff. No, he doesn't have the beautiful lost-in-a-crowd melancholy sound of early Miles Davis and his harmon mute, but Lee Morgan is as good in a different direction: intense, happy and upbeat.<br />Great bestseller album from the sixties. Burrows into your head and you hear it in your memory. A great album for Rocker's who think they don't like Jazz. Or those new to Jazz.
B00003CX9E|2.0|I'd heard so much about this movie that I finally bought it when it came out on this special DVD edition.  Boy was I disappointed.  The movie, supposedly based on the true-life news tycoon Hearst, is truly boring.  While technically it has a lot of merits -- the editing, the cinematography, the make-ups -- the story itself is really difficult to follow.  I paused the movie numerous times, because it was painful to go on watching it.<br />After finally finishing the entire movie, I took out a few books on movies and read the relevant chapters on Citizen Kane.  Of course they all sang high praises to the film.  Then I watched it again, this time looking for the &quot;classic&quot; moments as described in the books, but once again I found the film disorienting and painful to watch.<br />If you've never seen this movie, you may want to rent it first to see if you can stand it.  If you like it, you may consider the DVD edition with an extra DVD on how the movie was made (an equally boring documentary).
B00003CXMG|2.0|I was actually excited when I saw the previews for this movie. The problem with this movie isn't the story. It's the screen play (cookie cutter formula for people who didn't live through the 1970's), the script (unbelievably predictable), the acting (marginal at best, but not horrible) and the music (similar to a bad Led Zeppelin). If you end up liking this movie you might want to see &quot;Detroit Rock City&quot;.
B000002C2E|2.0|OK, since everyone likes a different side of Dylan, those who can guess my Dylan tastes will listen to me, the rest will disagree.  Fair enough. I actaully think &quot;Under the Red Sky&quot; is overlooked (cf. Robert Christgau's review, O Lordy, Dylan is Back Again!), even LIKE some tracks off &quot;Knocked out Loaded,&quot; (!) the live tour video &quot;Hard to Handle&quot; with Tom Petty, and love &quot;As Good as I Been To You.&quot; HOWEVER: I DISLIKE the production on &quot;Oh, Mercy&quot;  by Daniel Lanois--too swampy, murky and moody--didn't rock out enough. I believe in his live concerts and I think closing his 35th recording anniversary with &quot;Girl from the North Country&quot; says a lot.<br />The more I've listened to this album, the more I appreciate it. I might even give it 3 stars later on. But still, it seems overblown, over-praised, overrated. There are a few gems here, but on the whole, doesn't seem to stand up as a record.  Didn't even bother learning all of the song titles since I can't seem to listen to it from beginning to end.  Like his follow-up acoustic cover album, &quot;World Gone Wrong,&quot; the few gems are not enough to sustain a comprehensive listen.
156224003X|5.0|If you're an avid but stumbling musician this book will delight you.The spiritual aspect is difficult to absorb if you're a non-believer but the persuasive power of the man and his technique are tremendous.I've listened to lots of self-improvement and self-hypnosis/meditation type recordings but the accompanying cd is phenomenal -you could probably benefit enormously even if you didn't read the book but then you'd miss out on something immense if you didn't.<BR>Given me lots of ideas and makes me want to move of in many new directions.I haven't heard his music but as a motivator/instructor/guide this man's wonderful!
0671027573|5.0|This is what I call a blockbuster romantic suspense story!  Unbelievable!  I wish I could rate this with 10 or more stars, but I can't :(  I can't remember the last time I enjoyed a book as much as I enjoyed this one!  Over 400 pages and had it done in close to 8 hours, I could NOT put it down!  The characters jumped off the pages and the terror was so real I felt chills race down my spine!  The humor was one of the best parts and kept you distracted enough to gasp when the terror jumped in.<br />~Jaine Bright and her three best friends all meet every Friday night at the local bar and grill to girl-talk after work.  One night in particular they meet up and begin talking about what would make the 'perfect man.'  A conversation ensues, part joke, part serious until they have composed a humorous list of attributes &quot;Mr. Perfect&quot; should have.  The next day they forget about the 'list' and are shocked to find out that their list has been printed in the workplace newsletter and starts to show up in emails, on t.v. and even the radio!  The women are in shock!  What begins as a harmless joke turns deadly when all the women begin receiving threatening phone calls from someone who is disguising their voice and then one of the four is brutally murdered.<br />Completely in shock, Jaine turns to her unpredictable and unruly neighbor, a cop whom she has just met, not in good graces either for help.  Sam (the neighbor cop) thinks its just a weird coincedence until the htreatys and evidence startys to build to a frightening frenzy and he realizes his beautiful, but very aggrivating neighbor Jaine, is in serious danger from some crazy killer bent on shutting her and her 'list' friends up for good!<br />The tension and suspense is unbelievable!  I honestly did not guess the killer's identity at all and was in shock at the end!  The humorous parts were hysterical when Jaine tries to get along with the neighbor at first when she thinks he is some drunken druglord and completely rude and he thinks she is some dumb twit come to drive him insane!  I must say, the kitchen window scene is the best and will have you in tears!  The suspense and terror is very real and I found myself cringing and my heart racing on many parts.  This is very well my favorite romantic/suspense yet, this one will be hard to beat!  DO NOT miss this one, you well be sorry you did!  Now I have to start looking for all of Ms. Howard's books, she has a new devoted fan!<br />Tracy Talley~@y rude and he thinks she is some dumb twit come to drive him insane!

B00005OM4N|2.0|Being her sophmore album, I thought I would give Britney a chance. After all, the constant bambardment over the past three years of endless pop music has softened me up. So, I put aside my angry girl music and popped in what was to be the &quot;grown up Britney.&quot; I was suprised to hear the girl who doesn't think of herself as a &quot;sex kitten&quot; all tarted up and ready for action. Although Britney seems to tests the boundries with her fans and critics, this album seems too grown up for the under thirteen market and too kiddie for the adult in me. Nice try Brit, maybe next time you could release two albums; one that's PG and one that doesn't need to blurp out the &quot;S&quot; word.
0884271536|2.0|The ideas and concepts in this book are repeatitive of those in Goldratt's other books (The Goal etc.) If it were not for fulfilling school requirements, I wouldn't have spent money and time on this book.

B00005QK3W|1.0|Although Paul McCartney is an icon in the music world, this CD is by far one of his worst compliation of songs that I've ever listened to. I was hoping for so much more. The only decent song on the CD is the Freedom Song.<br />I for one, A long time Beatles and McCarntey fan am very disappointed with this lastest effort.
B000002JAX|5.0|I agree with previous posts that I'm surprised this is her only CD!  I saw her open for Sarah McLaughlin a couple years ago in Philly and I enjoyed her part more than Sarah!  I bought the CD then and have just re-discovered it in my collection.  I absolutely love it and wish she'd come out with some more great stuff!<br />If you like the 'standards' and want hear them sung by a great, sultry kind of voice, then you'll probably like this CD!<br />I'm in my 20's and love stuff like this - it's not just for people who remember the original releases of these songs!<br />Give her a try.....maybe she'll come out with something new soon!  I'll certainly buy it!

0385505833|4.0|O.K., Grisham is my favorite author.  So I didn't read &quot;A Painted House&quot;, but I got the first chapter by e-mail as I always do before his books are released, &amp; it just didn't grab me.  I'm sure one day I'll give it a chance because I love the way J.G. writes.  You should get a kick out of this!  As usual, Grisham's grasp of human idiosyncracy makes for some great moments.  I saw in a review in the newspaper where they're saying Luther belongs with Scrooge &amp; the Grinch.  A new holiday classic that everyone should try this season!  If Mr. Grisham would allow it, this would make for a great new holiday movie classic as well.  Can't wait for &quot;The Summons&quot;!
B00005QK3W|3.0|Much has been made of the alleged raw &amp; freshness of this album already, but for my taste it's still a tad too slick. Honestly, when I first heard of how Macca made a point of not over-producing it, I was actually expecting something a bit more spontaneous.<br />And although one certainly can't claim he laboured a lot over some of the lyrics (&quot;12345 Let's go for a drive/678910 Let's go there and back again.&quot; Granted it's accompanied by a good tune, but...yikes!), some of the music could've used more &quot;primitive&quot; approach. The more &quot;modern&quot; - albeit modestly - touches (&quot;She's Given Up Talking&quot;, &quot;Spinning on an Axis&quot;) sound forced and, frankly, just not in the man's nature, while the more typically Maccaesque material (&quot;From a Lover To a Friend&quot;, &quot;Tiny Bubble&quot;) just appears all-too-average and is easily on a par with something this guy could've written in his sleep! (No sly &quot;Yesterday&quot; reference intended here)<br />But, compared to his most memorable of &quot;recent&quot; solo works, overall it's a more even and satisfying effort than the somewhat overappreciated &quot;Flaming Pie&quot;, bits of which I can't even bear to hear any more, but lacks the joy and energy of &quot;Flowers in the Dirt&quot; - there's nothing here that even resembles the sheer loose fun of either &quot;My Brave Face&quot; and/or &quot;This One&quot;.<br />This album would've been a lot stronger with the ommission of at least 4-5 tracks, among those the unnessacarily lengthy (10+ minutes!!! I suppose this was supposed to make up the lack of spontaneity that plagues the rest of the disc, but it's all too much too late) throwaway jam of &quot;Rinse the Raindrops&quot; and the sleepwalking thru the lacklustre &quot;Freedom&quot; (lyrically it sends an uncomfortably mixed message, while musically it's obviously aiming for a &quot;Give Peace a Chance&quot; type anthem-ism, but misses by a mile or million).<br />That said, there are about 10 pretty good songs on here (no stand-outs, though); 2-3 forgettably MOR-ish and another at least 2 just plain forgettable and feeble. All'n'all it's all just too, well, average.<br />But don't get me wrong here: this isn't a bad album at all and 3 &amp; a 1/2 stars, if possible, would be a more accurate verdict.  Don't listen too closely to what some of Macca's more  Lennon-worshipping critics have to say about him; with one or three exceptions (much like solo Lennon, although Paul's been at it for 30 years while John did his in just 10) he just doesn't make that many all-around stinkers and &quot;Driving Rain&quot; is FAR away from being a contender for that small category.<br />Better luck next time, though, Paul. I for one will always be waiting and wanting for more. Let's just hope it won't be too long of a wait...
B00005LQ04|5.0|I first saw Suspiria a few years ago as a VHS rental but I couldn't remember too much about it. But suddenly, the world of Italian horror has been broken wide open so I picked up this three disk limited edition. Watching Suspiria is sort of like dreaming awake. Colored lighting is used to great effect and the sound track just sort of lulls one into submission. The plot makes about as much sense as a dream, that is to say, the movie all makes sense while watching but looses cohesion quickly once one returns to the &quot;real&quot; world. I think that is why I only remember watching the VHS rental but not too much of the movie.<br />The three disc set includes a newly made documentary and a Goblin soundtrack from the movie. The documentary suffers from subtitles that are sometimes washed out against a light background. Otherwise, it is informative. The Goblin CD is a lot fun to listen to and I find myself humming the main theme all the time. Unfortunately, I do not find a listing for the names of the songs. The main disk also includes trailers and radio spots and a Goblin music video of Demonia, which appears to be the main theme song.
B00004Z459|5.0|This CD is better than Staind. I love Rock so this was just the thing. I like all the beats and everything. The words are understandable where you don't have someone screaming in your ear words you can't even make out. The words to me have meaning.
B000002MUW|5.0|This is defintally one of Madonna's best albums.When critics claimed she was &quot;over&quot;,she proved them wrong.Bedtime Stories is different from most of her previous CD's.This one is filled with more soul/r+b than her previous works.The songs are all very well produced and(like all Madonna songs)are all very well written.<br />1.Survival-Survival is a straigh up R+B produced tune.I love her voice in the song and the lyrics are great.<br />2.Secret-The albums first single is awesome.Another straigt up R+B song.Definatlly one you can groove to.<br />3.I'd Rather Be Your Lover-Dancable,catchy,and well written.Great track.<br />4.Don't Stop-My favorite song off Bedtime Stories.Very catchy and the lyrics kinda go back to the old Madonna days.It's a song all about dancing<br />5.Inside Of Me-A song that will easily make you groove.The lyrics are so beautiful.<br />6.Human Nature-Madonna's bash to the critis who said she was &quot;over&quot;.Well written song and a great video.<br />7.Forbidden Love-Now we are slowing things down a smidge.I am diggin the lyrics to this song.It's beautiful.<br />8.Love Tried To Welcome Me In-Another slow jam.This song is so sad and beautiful at the same time.<br />9.Sanctuary-A very cool song.I love the lyrics to this one as well.Sounds a lil bit like something that Paula Adule would try to do.<br />10.Bedtime Stories-Another oe of my faves off the album.This was written by Bjork and it sounds so awesome.The video for this song is one of Madonna's best Video's.<br />11.Take A Bow-One of Madonna's best balads ever.This song is so sad that it can make you cry a lil bit.<br />All in all this is one of Madonna's best works and I think anyone who likes R+B should give it a try.Bravo Madonna,for this excelent album.
0061020680|3.0|What I remember about Indiana: laying on my grandparents' rug in the den late at night spread out reading Mort. It's not Terry Pratchett's best, in fact, it's one of his early ones before he got into the swing of things, but it had a good ending, which is why all of us read. Exciting, funny in parts, but not the hard hitting satirical edge that I love about Pratchett.
B00005B36H|5.0|Ok, so I am quite possibly the biggest fan of Tool in the world. Tool commands attention like the snap of two fingers or a crack of a whip. With the brief wait in the beginning of The Grudge to get the listener's anticipation up to a maximum, Lateralus, Tool's fourth studio album (not full studio album, but albeit studio album), kicks off to an amazing start, and with the final plead of Maynard in Faaip De Oiead, it comes crashing down on the listener, who should be blown away by the amazing musical mastery of Tool. The insane bass from master Justin Chancellor, the pummeling drum of the best drummer in the world Danny Carey (I don't care what anyone says, naysayer or no, he is the best), Maynard's sometimes melodic, sometimes aggressive, but always beautiful voice, and last but not least the awesome sounds of the axweilder, who displays force but great knowledge of how to weild the ax. If you even remotely enjoy one fleeting moment of this album, buy it. And with it their other three, as well as albums from other true musicians such as Deftones, Jane's Addiction, Korn (yes, Korn, not the horrid Life is Peachy or Follow the Leader, but the debut and the also excellent Issues), Taproot, BOYHITSCAR, Staind (definitely not their two albums on Fred \\"...\\" Durst's label, but Tormented, their independent record, with signs of actual good music making!) A Perfect Circle, and plenty more. You see, there is good music out there, so much good music, but you have to find it first. Good luck.
0380973839|5.0|Back in high school, in between reading Les Miserables and A Separate Peace for classes, I slipped into the covers of The Martian Chronicles. Yes, some of it seems outdated, and Bradbury seems to view the colonization of Mars under Manifest Destiny, i.e., American expansion, but the stories could've been written yesterday. And the images are fresh and vivid, like holograms that melt like wax and people seeing the plumes of fire from the blue marble. These descriptions are fresh and vivid. One can read this as a novel or as a collection of short stories, which is originally what Bradbury intended. I love this book so much!
0345413377|5.0|Although both of the first two books in this series are good, it is in the third and final book that you begin to realise just what it is Philip Pullman has achieved. No simple tale is this, instead charting the history and destiny of a thousand worlds, all locked together by the events of Northern Lights and The Subtle Knife.<BR>Taken at it's simplest level, this tells the story of two children growing up, and the titanic events that surround them are simply an incidental, albeit compelling, element. But this is too straightforward.<BR>On another level, that story is a retelling of the book of Genesis, complete with the fall of man, and his possible salvation. In this way of looking at the story, it becomes more all embracing, and no less powerfull.<BR>But even this description fails to fully justify the breadth of the book, as it can be perceived on so many levels. Who is God in the book? Is it the angels? The all covering Dust? Then again, who plays the role of Adam? Is it the impenetrable and capable Will? The uncontrollable Lyra? Possibly her father? Or, once again, is it the Dust?<BR>The book leaves you filled with these kind of questions, and yet absolutely sure that it is one of the most complete stories you will ever read, telling a tale so incredible, and at times moving, that to miss it would be to loose out on one of the best books ever written, and I defy you to tell me different.<BR>Go on. Buy it and see...

B00005QXXO|5.0|Although I was somewhat familiar with their music, I was never interested in radiohead until seeing the &quot;Paranoid Android&quot; video back in '97.  It peaked my interest, and on a lark, I bought OK Computer.  I had read no reviews and really knew nothing of the band (other than &quot;Creep&quot; and &quot;Fake Plastic Trees&quot;).  The first few spins of OK Computer were uneventful.  Then I noticed that it didn't leave my CD player for over a week.  I was hooked, but I wasn't sure why I was hooked.  I'm still not sure, but I love it.  It seems the same thing has happened with I Might Be Wrong.  I can't seem to extricate it from the CD player in my car.  The &quot;popular&quot; music scene hasn't been this stale since the late '80s.  Radiohead is a breath of fresh air.  Keep 'em coming.
B00005QK3W|3.0|This was bound to happen someday...<br />McCartney's new album is a decent effort, an unusual snapshot of his current life and times.  He's rarely been one to wear his heart openly on his sleeve, but if we are to take him at face value, he's opened up his soul more than ever before on this.  Listening to the pain, aching, hoping and praying in the lyrics, he's letting us see him as he rarely does - in fact, rarely ever has.<br />But in this effort of clarity, there's something surprisingly missing: the music.  Paul McCartney is well known for being one of the greatest pop songwriters of the 20th century, but now as we are into the 21st, his greatest skills seem to be diminished.  His famous hook-y melodies (whether they be ballads or rockers, he's always crafted great melodies) are nowhere to be found.  Instead, we get one-note groove songs, and even these seem to be repetitive from song to song.  On the occasions where he does stab into his craft, it's slight, almost lame.  As an example, \\"From A Lover To A Friend\\" reminded me of that hilarious scene in `The Rutles' where the McCartney character tries vainly to write a ballad, only to come up with a lah-lah-lah-lah valentine.  This is so surprising from Sir Cute Beatle.<br />Just as disarming are his vocals.  McCartney's pitch has always been top-notch, but here his voice is weak and he misses almost as many notes as he hits.  Once might attribute this to age, but there are as many pop vocalists of his generation and age that are still as strong as ever - yet McCartney's vocal prowess seems to be in dire shape.<br />But on the plus side, this is a snappy feeling record.  His band is punchy, contemporary, and Paul's bass playing is as solid and expressive as ever.<br />I was surprised and disappointed in \\"Driving Rain\\"...hopefully his next step into the CD spotlight may be stronger.  I hope he's not \\"done\\" yet.
B00000099Y|5.0|...These guys are outstanding musicians, no doubt about it, but many times they seem more interested in standing out as individuals than in making a go of the whole \\"band\\" thing. Chris did get a few things about the album right though: Maynard's vocals are outstanding and the Adam's guitar parts usually aren't very complex. Since the Maynard thing was meant as a compliment I'll leave it alone. The Adam statement deserves a closer look though. Sure Adam Jones doesn't dazzle you with his speed or technical abilities but ask yourself where a complex guitar solo would fit in any of these songs. Adam's strength is playing the absolute right note at the absolute right moment. His tone fits the mood of the album perfectly and I doubt John Petrucci would have done as well a job as Adam has. The bass on this record isn't relegated to a supporting role and is superbly written and executed. The drums? I can't say enough about the drum work on this album. Danny Carey is one of the premier drummers on the planet and if you don't think so, try following along with his drum beats (especially \\"H\\"). If you think you've got the hang of it, take a closer listen because you might be missing a few things. At the same time, however, the drums aren't sensationalized \\"look at me!!\\" type rhythms but rather subtle touches that can be missed if you aren't specifically listening for the drums. <br />As a whole, the band comes together flawlessy and creates an album that belongs on anyones \\"if you were stuck on a deserted island with only five albums, what would they be?\\" list. ...It is perfection!
B00001U03Q|3.0|This short disc of puffy hits seeks to re-position Eric not as a guitar god, but as an MOR crooner.  <br />Granted, he's had his soft hits, but his career and reputation hasn't been made there.  But Warners seems to have decided that, yeah, he plays a mean guitar but he's really an easy listening singer.  Which is like saying: sure, Einstein was a whiz at that math stuff, but did you ever taste his strudel?  <br />To drive home the point, the liner art is full of photos of Clapton with an acoustic guitar...not a Stratocaster in sight.  The real truth is shown on the portrait found on the traycard:  Clapton wincing with an \\"I-smell-excrement\\" look.  Exactly my reaction.<br />The legacy of Eric Clapton is his prowess on guitar - and you'll find little of it here.  So if you like your Clapton light and puffy, fine, but this is NOT Eric Clapton.
B00003CY0V|2.0|Makers of mediocre movies are just going to have to learn that they can't go around drawing idle comparisons between their own product and much better earlier films without having their own suffer by comparison.  Articulating such an analogy merely conjures up fond memories of the earlier film in the audience's mind, pointing up the inferiority of the current work at hand.  Take the case of \\"Swordfish,\\" a laughably bad bank heist tale that has the temerity, in its opening scene, to criticize Sidney Lumet's great 1975 classic \\"Dog Day Afternoon\\" for being too unrealistic and for catering to the audience's need to see goodness triumph over evil (the makers of this film have done such a shoddy job at research that they actually err in pinpointing the other film's release date - citing it as 1976 rather than 1975).  All this from a film that boasts not a single believable moment and, indeed, works overtime trying to strain credibility (perhaps that's the point and the whole shebang is simply a sick joke - a possibility that, come to think of it, becomes more and more likely, given the stupidity of some of the plot turns we are asked to swallow).<br />Like so many thrillers these days, \\"Swordfish\\" tries to dazzle us with an array of complicated looking computer hardware.  It isn't enough anymore for a band of robbers to storm their way into a bank, wave a few guns, take a handful of frightened hostages and hunker down for the duration, giving the authorities conniption fits with their exorbitant demands.  No, for now the robbers have to precede these activities with a good 75 minutes of computer downloading and money transferring.  John Travolta plays yet another of his stock villain characters, this time as a deranged, anti-terrorist megalomaniac named Gabriel Shear who will stop at nothing to \\"maintain America's freedoms,\\" even if it means committing crimes, subverting the Constitution and murdering all innocent and not so innocent people who get in his way.  One would think that tackling such a subject would give the film a veneer of topicality in the wake of the events of September 11th.  On the contrary, the reality of that day only helps to underscore the absurdity and stupidity of the film's cartoonish view of both terrorism and the methods necessary to combat it.  It also doesn't help that the film comes replete with some of the most laughably bad (and badly photographed) action stunt sequences to show up in a movie in a long long time, including a ludicrous car chase and shootout along the streets of West LA and a final sequence involving a bus literally flying over downtown Los Angeles that should be in some sort of hall of infamy for bad action scene ideas.<br />Hugh Jackman plays Stanley Jobson, a \\"retired\\" computer hacker just paroled from a stint in the big house, who allows himself to be coerced into joining Gabriel's motley crew of computer-geek assassins.  Having just endured \\"Blow\\" a few weeks ago, I was not prepared for yet another film featuring a \\"sympathetic,\\" desperate-to-reform criminal who is willing to return to a life of crime in order to secure custody of the little daughter he loves.  The parallels in their situations are simply uncanny and one begins to wonder what one finds more objectionable about these two characters: their soft-heartedness or their soft-headedness.  Halle Berry portrays the stereotypical smooth, icy-cool criminal sexpot who (ho hum) may or may not be what she seems.  Not that that really matters much in the absurd closing sequences of the film, where all logic, credibility and good old fashioned common sense are cavalierly thrown out the window and we are left scratching our heads in bewildered amazement wondering just what exactly transpired that our little pea brains didn't get.  When a film refuses to play by any rules related to the laws of the real world, we have every right to laugh it off the screen.<br />Which brings us back to \\"Dog Day Afternoon,\\" a film that, even a quarter of a century after it was made, still has the power to draw us into its world and make us care passionately about both its situation and its characters.  I guarantee that will never be said about \\"Silverfish,\\" not today, not twenty-five years from now, not ever.  You guys should only be so lucky.a quarter of a century after it was made, still has the power to draw us into its world and make us care passionately about both its situation and its characters.

B00005Q66T|2.0|Where can I begin...sure the songs here are great, but the omissions are way too glaring. And putting an edit of the soundtrack version of &quot;Don't Cry For Me Argentina!&quot;  That is just plain stupid. The dance version was the hit, and still can't be found on any of her albums. And where is &quot;You'll See,&quot; &quot;Rain&quot; (which was also remixed when released as a single--that remix isn't on &quot;Something To Remember&quot; either), &quot;American Pie&quot; (which isn't on any of her American albums but is on the European version of &quot;Music&quot;), &quot;Bad Girl,&quot; &quot;Fever&quot; (to have had the video version of that song would have been fantastic), &quot;I'll Remember,&quot; and the Oscar-winning &quot;You Must Love Me&quot;?  I would have much rather had any of those forgotten, bona-fide hits than &quot;Human Nature,&quot; &quot;Bedtime Story,&quot; or &quot;Drowned World,&quot; of which none were truly big hits. What a total, total disappointmet. Come on, Madonna, get involved with your music again!  And for those that don't know, &quot;Time Stood Still&quot; from &quot;The Next Best Thing&quot; is the greatest Madonna song no one has ever heard.
B00005NI5Y|5.0|...try this CD. You'll get it in your gut.<BR> If you haven't picked up a Dylan album in a while, your first listening will hurt, like catching a glimpse of yourself in an unexpected mirror around a corner. But it takes that voice to say what he says here: &quot;I'm no longer acquainted with/my old desires.&quot; Or &quot;Some of these memories/you can learn to live with/some of them...you can't.&quot;<BR> If &quot;Positively 4th Street&quot; was your biography once, this brings it up to date.

B000005TQO|5.0|I don't know why but this is Laura's Cd which I keep playing again and again, and I own almost all of her albums. It's her first one, her voice is at peak form, she sings in italian which I think suits her better than spanish, although she does a wonderful work singing in the latter, and last but not least, here you can find two wonderful songs that you cannot find anywhere else (not even in spanish): &quot;Dove Sei&quot;, just as awesome as &quot;La Solitudin&eacute;&quot; and the uplifting &quot;Baci Che Si Rubano&quot;. This Cd is worth every cent. After buying this one, &quot;The Best of Laura Pausini&quot; is an excellent next choice
0792844890|4.0|Having seen most of Mel Brooks' works and being a diehard Star Wars fan, I have to say this is probably Brooks' besk work.  I enjoyed how the counterparts matched and deviated from their equivalents in Star Wars, the funniest being Dark Helmet compared to Darth Vader.   The movie closely parallels the first movie the SW trilogy with small bits from the other two thrown in for good measure.  On another level, it was a wonderful comedy with great characters.  A must-see and May the Schwartz be With You :)
B00004YW6I|3.0|There are those who feel peculiarly drawn to PJHarvey, shyly observing her from a distance, attracted by her passionate singing, powerful lyrics and gradually unveiled beauty, but who somehow have not been able to commit to the relationship. After all, from the moment the staccato opening of Sheela-na-gig rattled from the radio in 1992 it was obvious that this was not a woman to be messed with. <BR>Dry was soon released with its growling bass and swirling storm; wind and rain lashing the Somerset countryside and Polly's little voice screaming to be heard, barely audible over the shrieking cacophony. Dry is stark, brutal, and a thrilling debut. Delilah is Samson's undoing in Hair, a song that builds with impending doom. Joe is manic and frenzied. Even the more subdued songs have Polly singing, &quot;I'm happy and bleeding for you.&quot; Or &quot;Plants and rags, ease myself into a body bag&quot; before collapsing in on itself under the confusion of groaning violin. The squeamish lyrics, the perversity of relating tales of wind and water on an album entitled Dry, was all a bit much to bare for some. <BR>She then went on to scare the hell out of everyone with 4 Track Demo and Rid Of Me, the latter with the grotesque arc of her hair and the &quot;What of it?&quot; expression on her face akin to the look she gives on her debut, full-frontal, semi-submerged, a set gaze challenging. With titles like M.Bike and 50ft Queenie I couldn't even bring myself to listen to it.<BR>Polly then appeared as... the Vamp. Oozing sexuality in the extreme, violent gash of red lipstick and luscious eyelashes, she was completely gorgeous to look at and wonderful to listen to. There is no denying the creepiness, however, a feeling not helped too much by a gargantuan bald guitarist playing the guitar with a knife. <BR>There are those who have always had a fixation with PJHarvey, keeping a keen, frightened, eye on her movements - just as one cannot help but stare at something horrific - and yetthey have never been able to avail themselves of her albums because something has not been quite right. To Bring You My Love performed is utterly mesmerising, to listen to repetitive. These people would be forgiven for thinking that Stories From The City, Stories From The Sea is finally the PJHarvey album that they can have in their collection. The first single, Good Fortune, is a tremendous song, enough to make the heart race with anticipation, enough to make the foolhardy eagerly rush out and purchase a copy of the album determined that this time all will be well.<BR>Polly is not going to ease you in gently but at least she is up front about telling you that she has not changed. Big Exit shrieks in (funnily enough) as the big opening, &quot;I want a pistol, I want a gun&quot; she screams, just in case there can be any mistake. Good Fortune lifts the spirits next, and everything continues to look hopeful with A Place Called Home. Harmony and counterpoint are definitely ways to win affection and they are employed to wondrous effect here, and Harvey continues in a similar quiet and melodious tone through One Line and Beautiful Feeling, but it is all a calm before a storm. When all goes silent there is the ominous whistle of an incoming doodlebug - run for shelter, head for safety - before The Whores Hustle And The Hustlers Whore explodes leaving a wake of devastation, the rest of the album in pieces. According to Courtney it takes a few more listens, but I'm not so sure. As time goes on the various nuances begin to burrow their way in, but the excitement engendered by the opening five songs is not sustained throughout. You Said Something definitely captures a feeling, and We Float is a suitably ethereal conclusion, but over all, sadly, it is distant and cold and unapproachable. <BR>Maybe PJ is just a girl to be loved from a distance after all.
B00003CX5P|4.0|As a die-hard Star Wars fan, I had eagerly anticipated the release of Episode I.  While the movie did not exactly disappoint, I can't help but feel it was not on par with its predecessors.  The DVD is an excellent purchase though, not only because it offers a wonderful view into the making of the movie and the various processes involved, but also in the way certain scenes were re-added back into the movie.  The film has an excellent cast and Lucas showed us once again that ILM can and will deliver when it comes to special effects.  Regarding the casting, I have to applaud the casting of Ewan MacGregor as a young Obi-Wan Kenobi.  The way he presented the character really gave a feel for the person all who have seen the original trilogy know him to become in the form of Sir Alec Guinness, such as his reference to being a headstrong youth in &quot;Empire Strikes Back.&quot;  I wasn't sure if I was going to like Natalie Portman in this role but I was pleasantly surprised to see her character in action and get a glimpse of where Princess Leia got her backbone.  A small gripe is the fact that even though this is a prequel, it doesn't make as much sense if you haven't seen the original trilogy, as a friend of mine pointed out when we saw Episode I and she hadn't seen the original trilogy.  I can see where she's coming from, because then certain things aren't as ironic, such as Obi-Wan's opening line and the significance of Anakin and Amidala looking the way they do.  Either, Episode I is an enjoyable film and definitely a must-own for any of the Star Wars fans.  I highly recommend purchasing the DVD over the video.
B000023X9W|5.0|The fact is, there's no pleasing a Neil Young fan. You might dig your heals in and refuse to buy any unauthorised material, content simply to bide your time and wait for Young to get around to releasing his songs officially - but when he does, the version he chooses to present to the paying public isn't the one you want! Here's another fact for you: Neil Young is a stubborn old mule. He'll release what he darn well wants to release and everyone can shut up and live with it. But Silver &amp; Gold has to be sung with harmonies, it certainly shouldn't be stripped right down to one man and his guitar. There's no pleasing some people. Truth is, it fits in perfectly with the whole experience that is Young's, what, 32nd, album?<br />Comparisons have inevitably been made with anything from Harvest to Comes A Time through Old Ways to Harvest Moon, but it differs considerably from all those releases. He has always promised a truly acoustic album, but somewhere along the line he has given in to plugging in Old Black, or he has drafted in some doohicky fiddle player to spice up the proceedings and belt the thing along a pace, but not here. Restrained, reflective, laid back. Neil Young, the man and his music, alone with his guitar and harmonica. He is joined by other musicians, but somehow you always get the feeling that this is just him, and it is quite fitting that he should keep the title track all to himself. He took eleven goes to get that song just right, he was never satisfied with the versions featuring extra musicians, and eventually settled with a low-key rendition, just him alone - no harmonies - and that is just the way it should be when the title track sums up the feelings that weave their way throughout all eleven songs: Our kind of love just never seems to get old, its better than silver and gold. Relationships are more important than material things. He's asked the question, he's found the answer, and they both amount to the same thing: Love. Love, friendship, family, that's what really matters, they're more important than riches, they're more important than this album.<br />Its not the first time Young has sung about love, not by a long shot. It's a word used in music in general with such abandon that any real meaning has been squeezed out of it long ago. But here, used in this context, it somehow sounds convincing. It must be because of Neil's years of marriage to Pegi and the experiences that he has lived through with her and their family. There is something warm and tender when words of love and affection are directed towards your betrothed and your kin. As the years pass by, events and memories begin to fade like the old photograph in Distant Camera, but love, love of this kind, will stand up to time. Here he has surrounded himself with his family and a few friends, and we can just be grateful to share in the results albeit from the other side of the great divide. The album is dedicated to his wife (who also took one of the photos), was inspired by Ben, and Amber is credited with the front and back cover photographs. The list of musicians is full of familiar and comfortable names. A poignant acknowledgement simply says, &quot;thank you to all my friends&quot;.<br />Good To See You heads the album off in the right direction, being about &quot;coming home after being gone a long time&quot;. It says very simply what needs to be said and because of that, and the overall concept of the album, it loses any sense of pretty sentimentality. It is not twee, it is just right. The songs are not all this lyrically simplistic. They are thoughtful and thought provoking, reflecting the feelings of a man fast approaching his sixtieth year just taking a moment to dwell on the past and consider the really important things in life. And he hasn't done this at the cost of the melodies. There is a lovely collection of songs here, some bright and cheerful - Good To See You and Daddy Went Walkin' - others, like Razor Love, tinged with sorrow.But it is an album that grows; it doesn't come together on the first listen and needs time for its whole worth to be appreciated. Gladly it doesn't suffer from being over-produced, and this is essential when it comes to Neil Young. He is at his best when he sounds raw and natural, and that is certainly the case with Silver &amp; Gold. It is honest and intimate. Harvest Moon is unconvincing because the crisp, clean production only serves to nullify the desired emotion and alienate the listener. It seems to sound somewhat sterilised and spiritless. But not so Silver &amp; Gold; it is warm and earthy and easy to listen to. It has the feeling of being spontaneous, this no more apparent than with Emmylou Harris' harmonies on Red Sun where the backing vocals are sung by a woman who is not entirely sure of what she's singing. And despite its over-all laid back tone, there are moments that really thrill - the first burst of acoustic picking on Buffalo Springfield Again when the drums come rattling up and the harp rushes in, is just wonderful. Horseshoe Man is a sweet and melancholy piano interlude, and Without Rings brings the set to a suitably brooding but unhurried conclusion; Young, basso voce, &quot;I'm picking something up, I'm letting something go. Like a dog, I'm fetching this for you.&quot;<br />Commenting on his decision to let three songs go to CSNY's Looking Forward, Young said, &quot;I had too many songs; they were all the same.&quot; You can see what he means on this album, but it is not wholly justified, and after two or three listens each of the songs forges a place of its own. But when all is said and done it is not about the songs, it is about people and the feelings associated with them. Relationships, real friends, and especially family, are more important than anything else. Put on Silver &amp; Gold, sit back, close your eyes and let the ragged fingerpicking, acoustic chords, and the familiar voice of Neil Young just wash over you.But it is an album that grows; it doesn't come together on the first listen and needs time for its whole worth to be appreciated.

B00005QY5Y|2.0|I first got excited about Ryan Adams after reading an interview with him where he cited Woody Guthrie and Bob Dylan as influences that made him &quot;tell the truth&quot;. I was excited about this apparently firebrand trubadour. But upon listening to GOLD, I am throroughly disapointed. The hype surrounding him is phenomenal, and he simply does not live up to it. GOLD consists mainly of slow ballads that don't really go anywhere, and lyrically he might as well say &quot;i'm in a band/ I play in the land&quot;. There are a few decent tracks here- &quot;New York, New York&quot; and &quot;Firecracker&quot; are listenable. But as far as alt country-no way. The rest of the album plays like a lame tribute to classic rock. &quot;Gonna Make You Love Me&quot; sounds like a pathetic ripoff of &quot;Pinball Wizard&quot;, and &quot;enemy fire&quot; sounds like he is trying to mimic Uncle Tupelo. Well Ryan, you're not Uncle Tupelo. Granted a lot of music sounds like the music that inspired it, but there is a fine line between imitation and emulation, and I don't think Ryan treads the line very well.So if you're looking for alt-country, rocking songs, then Uncle Tupelo, Son Volt, Wilco, Robert Earle Keene et al are right up your alley. If you want music that will play well on pop radio,sounds somewhat folky, and with a trendy posterboy to boot, then GOLD is right up your alley. You can put it alongside TRAIN in your CD collection.
B000002UAX|3.0|Good album, but since their is so much filler that you have to skip over, I give it a 3.
B000001FYL|5.0|This album truly shows the great Talent that Jon Bon Jovi uses in the other albums where he plays with the band. In some songs in Blaze of Glory you almost don't have any music, only the image of a great songwriter and singer that doesn't use any special effects to cover his voice, but has a very country/rock style that influences thousands to pick up guitars and start writing and playing. Great songs, catchy... fun to sing and fun to play... Buy this CD... but be careful, if you'll buy you'll end up buying the rest of his albums :) Enjoy.
055321263X|5.0|The Woman in White is a classic, perhaps overlooked novel of the Victorian era.  It is perhaps the first, and still one of the very few novels to have a lead female character who is (gasp) ugly!  Her introduction to the novel is priceless, and is one of my favorite character intro's of all time.  This is a tale of suspense and intrigue, as Marian Halcombe tries to save her sister Laura from an unwanted marriage with the help of Laura's tutor and would-be suitor Walter Hartright (heart's in the right place?).  Throw these three in the same house with Laura's villainous, deceitful husband Sir Percival Glyde, add in the evil Count Fosco plus a mysterious woman who looks an awful lot like Laura, and you have a tense, intriguing, complex novel.  I enjoyed this book thoroughly, and think that if you give it a chance, you will too.
B00005BJ2O|4.0|great cd - great movie.... except, like over half the people here say, AWOL are &quot;like a virgin&quot; and &quot;spectacular spectacular&quot;: two of the funniest parts of the film.  and they're great music.  also missing: &quot;on with the show&quot;.  plus: &quot;come what may&quot; happens many times in the film.  why not have that on twice instead of david bowie singing &quot;nature boy&quot;.  which leads me to my final gripe: &quot;nature boy&quot; is sung in the film twice - by john leguizamo.  his version was nice and should have been included.  all in all, an enjoyable but flawed soundtrack for a  masterpiece of a film.  the greatest thing you'll ever learn is just to love and be loved in return.
B00003CXXJ|5.0|If you've ever felt like the ugly duckling, or the frog waiting to become a prince, you will really be able to relate to this movie.  I loved the animation, and I loved the humor, but what really struck me as the outstanding feature of this movie was the love story.  If you've ever asked yourself &quot;How could he/she ever love someone like me?&quot; this story will really hit home.  You don't have to be Prince Charming or Cinderella to have your very own happily ever after!
006092988X|4.0|I found the book very good at an 8th grade level. I had to read it for history class and many people enjoyed it. It was a great subject for our class because we are studying early 1900s. It was great in detail of the problems and impoverished life of many immigrant families in New York. The only problem I found, was that it was so detailed that it became a little boring at times, or that the detail confused me. If you want to read a good book about a teen girl in the early 1900s, read this. Its a great book.
B00005R2M3|2.0|Sooooo disappointed. <br />I'M A HUUUUUUUUUUUGE SHAKIRA FAN, have been for the past six years. I don't want to say this BRUNETTE sold out: her hair looks as good now as it did when it was red, but her songs just aren't poetic when they're translated word by word. And her voice sounds much better in spanish because she's not struggling with the pronunciation in the same way.  <br />Fool is OK.  The words are understandable. It's not that easy to sing in another language, so kudos.  The one's in spanish are GREAT! reminds me of what we're missing out on. <br />I'd recommend buying her Unplugged album, Piez Descalzos,  or Donde estan los Ladrones (and maybe a dictionary)...<br />Shakira, te deseo lo mejor. Me encanta tu musica, y tus canciones, he comprado todos tus CD (este tambien) pero no dejes de cantar en espa~ol. Q no se te olvide quienes son tus fans.
B000002AVF|5.0|After dominating the charts with \\"Music Box\\", with the hit singles \\"Dreamlover\\" (8 weeks at #1), \\"Hero\\" (4 weeks) and \\"Without You\\" (#3), Mariah outdid herself with \\"Daydream\\", her best album to date. Like \\"Music Box\\", \\"Daydream\\" spent long weeks at #1. Here's my review:<br />1) Fantasy - Probably one of Mariah's best songs. It reminds me kind of \\"Dreamlover\\" with its catchy chorus.<br />2) Underneath The Stars - I wasn't really into this one at first but after listening to it over and over, I really like it today and it's one of my favourites on this album.<BR>They even added those vinyl scratches you hear at the beginning so it would sound like an old 70's tune.<br />3) One Sweet Day - no need to talk about this one too much. Spent 16 consecutive weeks at #1 and is also very good.<BR>I really like the beginning.<br />4) Open Arms - one of my favourite songs ever! I was introduced to this song only when Mariah sang it but apparently it was already a hit back in the 80's by \\"Journey\\". The chorus is incredible (!!!) and so are the verses!<br />5) Always Be My Baby - A light R&B song, which was nominated for a Grammy award. It was the third single from the album, and the third one to hit #1. It's very fun and catchy. One of my favourite Mariah songs ever.<br />6) I Am Free - the best song on the album! Mariah really showcases her vocals on this one. And lyrically, it's incredible as well. <br />7) When I Saw You - Another truly beautiful song from Mariah and Walter Afanasieff. You'll agree with me when you'll listen to it.<br />8) Long Ago - I did not like Long Ago when I first heard it, but like track 2, the more I listened to it, the more I liked it.<BR>Still, it's not one of my all-time favourites but is still remarkable. It's R&B, I forgot to mention :)<br />9) Melt Away - the verses and chorus are terrific. It's worth to listen to the whole song just to hear Mariah hitting the high notes at the end. It's not quite obvious, certainly don't expect something like in\\"Vision Of Love\\" but I like it.<br />10) Forever - right from the first second, you can recognize it's a 50's-style song. It's very beautiful and memorable. You'll like it right after the first time you listen to it.<br />11) Daydream Interlude - the lyrics remind those of \\"Fantasy\\" (well' it's called \\"Sweet Fantasy Mix\\") but still, they are unique and the music is upbeat. <br />12) Looking In - I love it! \\"Outside\\" from the \\"Butterfly\\" album reminds this one. They both talk about Mariah the person and are beautiful and original.<br />As you can see, \\"Daydream\\" is my favourite Mariah album. If you don't own it, you're missing something very special.

B00001OH7Y|5.0|This album is dominated by guitar sounds from Robert Fripp &amp; Carlos Alomar &amp; Pete Townshend. Fripp and Alomar are longtime Bowie associates but the addition of Pete Townshend, who just plays on &quot;Because You're Young&quot; is a welcome one. That is perhaps the best song on the record. The hits you are familiar with and are like much of this album great but not the kind of music you really want to hear over and over again. The lyrics are sometimes harsh and give the album a feel Bowie fans might not be used to or want. Like &quot;Ashes to Ashes&quot; which tells the story of Major Toms return to earth, the album has a just become aquainted with the world and its a harsh place theme to it. &quot;It's no Game&quot; and its reprise frame the album and along with &quot;Scary Monsters&quot; and &quot;Scream Like a Baby&quot; make the album seem a little paranoid, or a lot paranoid. Some have called this the &quot;realists&quot; Bowie album but thats not quite getting it right. &quot;Teenage Wildlife&quot; and &quot;Because You're Young&quot; are the only two which deliver straightforward narratives with wide applications to Youth in general, so they remind some of Pete Townshend songs. That is on the mark. But the majority of these songs are in the paranoid category. Perhaps the most accurate way to describe this album is to say that it continues on with the dark and pessimistic and alienated Berlin albums but where there the lyrics were easily lost in the overall sound, here they are underlined, brought sharply into the foreground and are impossible to ignore. Perhaps Bowie himself has something to do with the way people interpret this album because when it came out all the graphics that promoted it had Bowie making fun of all his previous incarnations as if he was done with all that. Maybe. Here he plays with Pete Townshend on one song and Tom Verlaine on the Verlaine penned &quot;Kingdom Come&quot; as if proving to people that he has changed his ways once and for all.

B000009FHN|4.0|If you haven't heard &quot;dead souls&quot; just know it's one of the better songs on the c.d.    Is it worth the price?  It depends, if you're collecting the halos and different versions I'd recommend it definetly but if you just like nin you might be happier getting the us version and if you like &quot;dead souls&quot; that much just buy the lost highway soundtrack like everyone recommends.  I thought it was worth the price though.
B00001OH7P|5.0|1)Space Oddity(72),orange haired punk cover but not punk, many aspects to this record, many inluences, some literary(Burroughs), some memorable, some not.<br />2)Man Who Sold The World(72), heavy metal but not numbing to the brain, thinking mans metal, good hard droning heavy and menacing but solid all the way through. &quot;She Shook Me Cold&quot;.<br />3)Hunky Dory(73),Very lyric and melodic throughout. A catchy batch of pop tunes with depth to them. Not one rocker but many will stay in your head long after you've heard them. &quot;Changes&quot;, &quot;O You Pretty Things&quot;. Plus the kooky &quot;Kooks&quot; and the homages to Dylan, Warhol, and Reed.<br />4)Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust(72), sheer masterpiece of hard and gritty glam rockers and soulfully sung glam ballads. Perfect record, blending incisive hooks and great vocal sounds. Lyrics tell a story but the music comes first so is not bogged down by a narrative which comes and goes. A sonic experience of the highest order.<br />5)Aladdin Sane(74), not as good as Ziggy but hits to marvel at like &quot;Jean Genie&quot; &amp; Stones cover &quot;Lets Spend the Night Together&quot; but even better is  &quot;Panic in Detroit&quot;. Not a great overall record but a good one.<br />6)Diamond Dogs(74), other than the great &quot;Rebel Rebel&quot; not much to make you sit up in your chair.<br />7)Young American((75) great hits &quot;Young Americans&quot; &amp; &quot;Fame&quot; but souless soul fills the rest.<br />8)Station To Station(76) A return to greatness, Infectious seven tracks but only seven.&quot;Golden Years&quot;, &quot;Stay&quot;, &quot;TVC 15&quot;....<br />9)Low(77)A Masterpiece but a dark one. Its appeal is a limited one. Good songs on side one and synthesizer age monastic chant(for modern monks?) on side two.<br />10)Heroes(77)Great Great side one songs, all of them. Side two is again synthesizer instrumentals, though more ear friendly than Low, not for everyone.<br />11)Lodger(79)Not a very popular Bowie album but it does contain the very bouncy &quot;Boys Keep Swinging&quot; which ends in a great peel of guitar frenzy. And &quot;Look Back in Anger&quot; and no instrumentals.<br />12)Scary Monsters(80)&quot;Ashes to Ashes&quot; &quot;Fashion&quot;. Great guitar sounds throughout.

6305750750|4.0|Most people are familiar with Star Wars.  Those that aren't, should be.  Taking advantage of the letterbox edition here allows a viewer to see all of the screen picture, not waht was edited to fit your screen.  Obviously, the movie was amazing in its production, but at the same time, it had more cuteness in it than Ewoks could ever hope to offer.  Between Jar-Jar Binks and Anakin Skywalker, I really hope future episodes are more dark and on-the-edge than this was.  Still, for no Star Wars film in 20 years, seeing this movie at midnight opening day was one of my favorite memories. (And lest you think I am a sci-fi nut, just think of all the folks at 7am driving to work, hearing the whole plot ruined for them by some DJ who finally was allowed to discuss the movie...)

B000002JS6|4.0|I always hear people talking about acdc has the same song over and over with the same riffs.  But the truth is they are really good musicians. They had talent and they knew how to use it.  The most recognized song on here would be &quot;You shook me all night long&quot; but I personoly think &quot;Back in black&quot; is a better song. Pick this one up for sure.....
B00005NWRS|5.0|Ive been hooked since the postie dropped it through my door on its day of release, and totally unexpected so soon after the excellant 'heartbreaker'. ryan adams fans have been well spoilt the last couple of years, with the much delayed whiskeytown third album also being released this year. of all three of these brilliant albums 'gold' is exactly what it says on the tin 70 odd minites of classic alt country pop/rock and in the real world would be a massive contender for album of the year. there are to many standout track's to start listing them all, but by the time you reach the end of track 16 you'll feel as if you have been guided through every musical emotion possible, then you,ll press repeat and do it all over again
B00005A46T|2.0|Alright, 2 stars is way too generous. More like a star and a half. This is utterly ridiculous. These guys repeatedly suggest that they're inspired by Death Metal (heck, Mick and Joey were even in the band Anal Blast at one time), but this is just too KoRnY for me. $lipknot reflects Capitalism at its worst. It's 'disturbing' that someone is even comparing these posers and Disturbed to Deicide (PLEASE!). The drummer Joey is a mediocre drummer and appears to be the only member of the band with a shred of knowledge of his instrument. He would be best suited in a band that actually displayed some intricacies to coincide with his drumming. <br />I would definitely not recommend this album unless you enjoy 2-chord, flavor of the month pop rock tripe.  Don't insult your intelligence by purchasing this garbage. If you really think you're a fan of that ever-present word Metal (which this is nowhere near), then buy some albums from Suffocation, Myrkskog, Opeth, At The Gates, Meshuggah, In Flames, Gorguts, Epoch of Unlight, Disgorge, Soilwork, December Wolves etc. etc. Come on...I dare ya. Lets see how Metal these trend-riding \\"maggots\\" really are.  Maybe only then you'll realize that you never did listen to Metal like you thought.  Resist this trash and think for yourself, don't let corporate suit and tie guys decide what you're going to listen to (HA!  And silly you thought that you were anti-establishment!). I hope this review helps at least one person broaden their horizons and set their souls free from this frivolous, musical ineptitude.  If not, at least this \\"music\\" (I use the term very loosely) has assisted in weeding out the weak and clearly divided them from others with a true passion and understanding of music.
0679420355|5.0|&quot;The Mayor of Casterbridge&quot; feels like something Charles Dickens would have written if he had been a more efficient storyteller, more economical in his prose, and had a better understanding of how humor is supposed to be applied to tragedy, if at all -- with subtlety and congruity.  This is not intended to be a slight against Dickens, but rather a testament to the quality of Thomas Hardy's writing.<br />The first chapter alone is a dramatic masterpiece and perfectly sets the rhythm for the rest of the novel.  A young man named Michael Henchard and his wife Susan and baby daughter Elizabeth-Jane enter a village where Henchard hopes to find work as a hay-trusser.  They go to a country fair where Henchard immediately gets drunk and sells his wife and baby to a sailor.  Regretting his actions the next day, Henchard looks for them in vain, swears off liquor for twenty-one years, then takes up residence in a town called Casterbridge.<br />Nineteen years later, Susan, now widowed, and Elizabeth-Jane track Henchard to Casterbridge.  It turns out that in the intervening years, Henchard has become a successful granary owner and is now the town's mayor.  He welcomes his former wife and daughter, proving himself to be genial but often petty and easily vexed.  For one thing, he is in a bitter rivalry with a former employee, a young Scotchman named Donald Farfrae, not only in business but also for the affections of a vixenish woman named Lucetta who has recently moved to town.<br />Hardy wastes no pages unfolding the plot, which is filled with Dickensian intrigue.  It chronicles Henchard's relationship with Susan and Elizabeth-Jane after their return, his jealousy over Farfrae and Lucetta (who happens to be Henchard's old flame and inadvertently incites a public scandal because of this), his fear of the discovery of his deceit, and, finally, his feelings of isolation from Elizabeth-Jane and the town he loves.  By the end, you realize that Henchard is not a bad man; he's a lonely man who's made the mistake of letting his love for Elizabeth-Jane distort his judgment.<br />Especially impressive is Hardy's prose, which is strong and descriptive without being florid.  He has a sharp ear for native dialects, and the dialogue of Casterbridge's inhabitants comes off as genuinely homey chatter rather than just dispensations of information set up to advance the plot.  Moreover, like any good fictional place, Casterbridge takes on a vibrant life of its own, offering a realistic bucolic backdrop for this stormy human drama.'s a lonely man who's made the mistake of letting his love for Elizabeth-Jane distort his judgment. <br />Especially impressive is Hardy's prose, which is strong and descriptive without being florid.

There, he recieves training to become a military commander. <BR>Earth had been attacked by a race of aliens, who were trying to take over the planet for their uses. The human race then fought them off, and prepared for another invasion. They took children, and trained them to lead the defense of earth. Ender is among the smartest ever. <BR>He is trained at Battle school, where he takes part in a series of games, or mock battles. He developes new tactics, and along the way, realizes the truth behind the battles. <BR>I was taken away by the story of Ender, and am a fan of the other Ender series books. <BR>What made Ender's Game so brillient was the morals and the exploration of the human mind that Orson Scott Card wrote. Ender goes from a scared little kid to a mature teen under battle condistions and the way it was portrayed was phenominal. Ender burns out, realizing what he has done and what he has to do to live up to the stresses that he was shaped under.<BR>Ender is nothing short of brillient. He created a new way of thinking in the battle school, and shows the underlining hero-against-society plot, and the hero-under-pressure plot. This book touches the basic human in a person, friendship, leadership, love and care-- not to mention morals. <BR>In the end, ender has to choose between the human race and the aliens in order to survive.

B00005OWIU|5.0|The music is wonderful and moving. But, to the people out there that say the music is unmoving, you have to see it with the movie to get the real point. I was sitting there watching the chess scene as the loud music plays, and Ron directs the pieces. My heart is racing, but my heart probably won't be beating as hard when I'm listening to it in the car. But. the music is still composed wonderfully! I LOVED IT AND I STRONGLY SUGGEST THIS CD TO EVERYONE!
B000002UA0|4.0|The band actually got started by releasing a handful of singles prior to the release of Piper like &quot;Arnold Layne&quot; and &quot;See Emily Play&quot;, but Piper At the Gates of Dawn is an excellent example of how Pink Floyd was once like. Twenty years later, in 1987, they'd release A Momentary Lapse of Reason which was basically the sound of a band more interested in being rock stars than caring for music, that's a totally different story with Piper. Of course, at this point David Gilmour was still not in the band, with Syd Barret instead. The only reason why I took a star off this album is some of the songs sound like rather dated psychedelia, not to mention some of the lyrics just seem dorky and naive and is painfully obvious when these songs were written (although not all of them). When I listen to it, I can't help but imagine paisley vests and flowers in hair. &quot;Flaming&quot; and &quot;Chapter 24&quot; are by far the worst cuts on the album, just so cheesy that I now skip those songs while listening to this album. &quot;Bike&quot; and &quot;The Gnome&quot; are also very cheesy but bearable enough where I don't have to skip them. &quot;Astronomy Domine&quot; on the other hand, has aged much better and actually has more '70s-like sci-fi lyrics than '60s psychedelia, in fact I'm pretty sure this song had a big impact on Hawkwind as they often written songs with similar lyrics. &quot;Matilda Mother&quot; also works better since it's Richard Wright and not Syd Barret who was singing that cut and actually bears more a resemblance to later Pink Floyd. There are two great instrumentals as well, &quot;Pow R. Toc H.&quot; and &quot;Interstellar Overdrive&quot; which shows that Pink Floyd was the pioneer of space rock. I'm sure the latter had a big impact on Amon Dl II because on their Tanz der Lemminge (aka Dance of the Lemmings), they took they idea of &quot;Interstellar Overdrive&quot; to the extreme by doing a whole side that was even more of in instrumentalfreak-out than &quot;Interstellar Overdrive&quot;. Without this band, there'd be no Tangerine Dream (the early 1970-1973 material, that is, as opposed to their more recent New Age material), Amon Dl II, Hawkwind, Eloy, and countless other progressive rock bands that tend to the space rock spectrum. Piper at the Gates of Dawn showed the band just starting out, not to mention the enthusiasm they had of creating this music. It's not a perfect album, and I feel several albums they released up to Animals were better, but I think around the time of Momentary Lapse of Reason, the band really needed to look back at this album (and other of their early albums) instead of letting their egos get out of hand and being more concerned with being rock stars. So if you're a big fan of Pink Floyd, or curious how they were like before Dark Side of the Moon, be sure to pick up The Piper at the Gates of Dawn.
B00003CXXJ|4.0|This movie is enjoyable overall and the technical achievement is remarkable.  The acting, too, is quite good, particularly from the brilliant Eddie Murphy who makes the most of every line and even wrings humor out of straight lines several times.  The film never reaches the heights of humor and heart that &quot;Toy Story&quot; achieves but that's probably an unfair comparison.
0812550757|4.0|This book is definately worthy of being the sequel of Ender's Game. Although not as good it's a good read. Most of the novel is good, but most is also slow. It takes a long time to develop the settings and characters. But twoard the end it gets really good. Some of the dialogue is hard to understand, most of that is because it's in Potugese. Although tough to understand, if you speak Italian, Spanish, or know Latin you should be able to figure out those not translated. Some people ask why did he pick Portugese. Simple really, it's because Card was a missionary in Brasil for a while.<br />  Now as far as the setting of the story. It takes place about 3000 years after the tragedy that was brough on by Ender, now also known as the Xenocide. Due to space traveling there was a large alteration in Ender's age. Making him able to be the main character of this book. But since then a lot has changed, one of the main changes is that speaking for the dead has sort of become like a religion. Now Ender was summoned by a xenologer's apprentice, Novinha, to speak for Pipo, the xenologer killed by the pepequine race (a.k.a. Piggies, the pepequino race is an alien race found on the space colony Lusitania). While Ender was on his way to the colony another died by the hands of the pepequinos, Pipo's son Libo, and Novinha's husband Marcão died as well due to a disease. Both were requested to be spoken for.<br />  Now Ender must face the whole colony of Lusitania, and later the congress. I cannot tell much more than what I did without spoiling it more than I already did. However, if you're going to read this book I suggest reading Ender's Game first. But it's optional really  because this book colud stand as a completely different story, because it doesn't follow the story of the previows one.<br />Son Akira
B00005R2M3|5.0|No Latin artist has crossed over to a full English disc to make the commotion Shakira has since Enrique Iglesias. Her English debut &quot;Laundry Service&quot; explores new music styles without straying far from her gorgeous and expressive debut.

Don't think Shakira is merely a one-hit English wonder. No, no. With tracks like &quot;Rules,&quot; &quot;Objection&quot; (Tango) and &quot;Underneath Your Clothes,&quot; this lady wows us with her impressive vocabulary and unique voice. Though she may seem more appropriate singing in Spanish, after a few listens, it's very easy to realize you've gotten some great laudry service!
076790382X|5.0|I just loved this book, as I did all the others by Bill Bryson. He pokes a lot of fun at his fellow countrymen. I saw some harsh jugements with some of the other reviewers. I can understand that. It's difficult when someone holds a mirror in your face and you get to see yourself n a way that you don't like. I recently bought and read a book written by two Americans about the Dutch and their habits (I am Dutch). I didn't always like what they had to say but everything they said was true and it was extremely funny.
B00004SPYK|5.0|The plot and characters of this stylish film are just an excuse for displaying a certain type of life style.  The movie is really cinematic in its original big screen vibrant colors (subsequent releases in VHS tapes and DVD are truly disappointing with rather pale and dull colors).  This film is a must see for any eligible bachelor who wants some ideas about the right clothes and furniture.  The sound track is superb and this is one of those movies that make LA and its various neighborhoods look very very cool indeed!
0446310786|5.0|With 700 plus reviews, I will keep this one short. I must confess I have read this book either in high school or junior high, but I barely remember it. After reading it again the second time, I have to say, that it is one of those books that every time you read it, it leaves with a greater impact on your soul. I plan to read this book again in 10 or 20 years just to see what new insights I can glean from this book.<br />The story is told from a young girl's eyes, as she witnesses some doings in Maycomb. Scout and her brother Jem are the town's lawyer's children. While growing up, they begin to discover why their father is really a gentleman, especially when he defends a black man accused of rape. That trial is not only felt throughout the town, but it affected Jem and Scout too in coloring their viewpoints of the world around them. <br />This is not your typical coming-of-age book. This is a book meant to provoke people to think and ponder on some of the issues she deals with in this book. It is a book I think every one should read ~~ regardless of their values and beliefs. I know that it is one book I plan to have my children to read as well as the nieces and nephews in my family. It is a book designed to get people to think and act ~~ not to live life passively.<br />It's a book for the classics. One for the ages ahead to read as well as those in the present too.

B00005BCPC|1.0|This video was a great disappointment for one who has read and re-read all of Jane Austen's works over several decades and obtained this video after having worn out the 1986 two-volume BBC-CBS FOX video version.<br />This newer video version insinuates evil-with-intent in most of the characters rather than seeing them through the eyes of Jane Austen's modest Fanny.  Perhaps this appeals to those who delight in violence, in believing the worst in everyone and every society.  For me, however, one viewing was one too many.
B00005Q66T|4.0|I am probably one of the biggest Madonna fans there are ... having loved and followed her career from the moment I first heard the song &quot;Pretender&quot; (I was in 8th grade) in 1984. I had the tremendous fortune of seeing her live in concert this past August - and it was everything I could have hoped for. Her music of the past decade is the best it's ever been...yet, I cannot give this greatest hits compilation a 5-star review. Too much is missing: &quot;Bad Girl&quot;, &quot;Fever&quot;, &quot;Nothing Really Matters&quot;, &quot;This Used to Be My Playground&quot;, &quot;American Pie&quot;, and &quot;You'll See&quot; immediately spring to mind. What is here, of course, is fantastic though I am also disappointed that several of the songs on this album seem to have been edited, however slightly, for reasons I don't know. The most glaring edit occurs in the song &quot;Human Nature&quot;. The chorus has more or less been stripped down. Gone is the line: &quot;I'm not your b***h, don't lay your s***t on me,&quot; which I've always thought was the whole centerpiece of the song.<br />Nonetheless, the songs are great. Madonna goes into the third decade of her career in better shape than ever. In 2010, I'll be first in line for GHV3.
B000021Y7X|1.0|I loved &quot;Stop Making Sense&quot; when it hit the movie theaters back in the mid 80's.  I was Very Disappointed with the DVD.  It Was Not the movie !!   It was all this bogus and unnecessary commentary laid over a classic piece of performing arts.  The ceaseless drivel totally ruined this classic live music performance.  I would Very Much like to get the Original Movie &amp; not this dubbed nonsense.  I am very unsatisfied.
B00005OB0A|4.0|The follow-up to last year's immensely enjoyable &quot;Light Years&quot;, Kylie's latest album is equally fun though perhaps not quite as good. The best song is definitely &quot;Can't Get You Out of My Head&quot;, which recently stormed up the charts in the UK. With its throbbing minimalist electronic Euro-club sound, after only one listen I guarantee you won't be able to get the song out of your head. Another great track is the album's closer, &quot;Burning Up&quot;. (No, it's not a cover of Madonna's 1983 song of the same title.) If ever there was a song to get you up and dancing, it's this one. In fact, the same can be said for each of the album's 12 tracks. <br />While Kylie is still no Madonna, she's an awful lot of fun, and she's progressed light years from her earlier bubble-gum hits &quot;Loco-Motion&quot; and &quot;I Should Be So Lucky.&quot; I don't understand why she's never really caught on in the States. Perhaps because most of the chart-topping artists in the US don't seem to have much room for anything with no greater pretension than having fun.<br />Kylie will put a smile on your face while you break a sweat whether on the dance floor or in your living room.

Tommy Wilhem es un fracasado de 44 años quien le gusta lamentarse de sus problemas con todo el mundo y es ese lloriqueo el que hace que el personaje nos resulte antipático, torpe y mediocre. En su juventud tomo las decisiones equivocadas, como muchos jóvenes han hecho, pero eso no es motivo para lloriquear por lo que se ha hecho o se ha dejado de hacer. Su problema no es ese, sino de actitud ante la vida. Su miedo a ser un inadaptado lo convierte en eso, en  un inadaptado. La cosa de la que huimos a veces esta más cerca mientras más huimos de ella. Solo cuando nos enfrentamos a la vida con valor y con entereza estamos nosotros prestos a vencer nuestros demonios internos y llegar a ser alguien. Pero no se equivoquen en este punto; ser alguien no es ser un acaudalado millonario o un empresario prospero, por mucho que a usted se le quiera convencer de ello. Ser alguien es amarse como uno es, sin reservas y estar contento con lo que la vida y las circunstancias le han dado por el día de hoy, eso es ser alguien y alguien feliz.<BR>Ya lo dice la cita completa del latín: carpe diem minimun crédula postera: Goza del día de hoy sin creer mucho en el mañana.<br />Luis Méndez.

Let's do right by them.  They are a national treasure and they remind us of the costs in social and personal life for democracy's/our sakes.  They also teach us much about how social life could be, if we all treated each other as bands of brothers (and sisters)!  Read it!

More on that in a moment.<br />Very likely, if you picked up this fairly thick book, it was because you had read Neal Stephenson's &quot;Snow Crash,&quot; a very readable, much shorter book.<br />This book is in a different league altogether. It grabs your attention from the start, and I would say that it's only real fault is its length. However, I should also say that Stephenson really needs every page to say what he has to say. It would seem impossible to edit out any part of this book. His characters are vivid and believable. This book will keep you happy and occupied for many nights before lights out.
0385505833|5.0|I really enjoyed reading this story.  This is how I am sure many people feel about the Christmas  in things that have to be done.  Was there some meaning to the character that was introduced late in the book - Martin.  I was not sure what this person had to do with the family or Christmas to them.  This book will be out for my whole family to enjoyed this Christmas.

0897500482|5.0|I am a thai-boxer and a martial arts enthusiast. I have read a lot of books, seen a bunch of tapes and had a couple of teachers. When one gets to a certain degree of expertise, what makes you be above your opponent is that set of details like defense and attack technique nuances, fainting, relaxation, mind control, phylosophy and a series of other attributes only the greatest master was able to study and give us as a present at the time of his death. Unfortunately, he was not lucky to brush up on his art because of his early departure.<br />Interesting, this book serves any kind of martial art. Lee studied a lot and his personal library was one of the largest. His knowledge covered each and every form of martial art, as well as phylosophy and physical conditioning. Maybe one of the greatest genius of this century. <br />And a quote from the book for those who say Bruce Lee was &quot;blind&quot; to other styles: <br />&quot;He (Lee) did not intend it to be a 'how-to' book or a 'learn kung-fu in 10 lessons'. He intended it as a record of one's man way of thinking and as a guide, not a set of instructions. If you can read it in this light, there is much to be aware of on these pages. And probably you will have many questions, the answers to which you must seek within yourself. When you have finished this book, you will know Bruce Lee better, but hopefully you will also know yourself better. Now open your mind and read, understand and experience, and when you have reached that point, discard the book. The pages are best used for cleaning up a mess -- as you will see.&quot; -- Linda Lee (wife and compiler of the book)
B00005NI5Y|5.0|This album gets better the more you listen, and I liked it the first time. I won't add much to the other good reviews here, except one interesting fact no one mentioned.I am a fan of Chery Crow's Globe Sessions album, and she covered &quot; Mississippi&quot;. I did not like the song, her tempo, or phrasing , or the way she sang the melody.It is TOTALLY a different song when Bob sings it. It is so much deeper, and almost sad in places, instead of the uptempo pop she did. What was she thinking ?? Thanks again, Bob, for another great one.
0790742780|3.0|This film is really out there, but it dosen't lose its focus,&amp; is quite funny at times, Michael Douglas is a unemployed guy who loses his sense of reality, it begins on a very hot day in L.A., sweating in standstill traffic, he exits his vehicle &amp; attempts to walk home, on his journey every thing that can tick him off does, beginning with not having change for a phone call, then trying to get change in a convenience store, then being told to buy somthing in exchange which in turn will not give him enough,he then loses it on the clerk, as he walks through L.A., he is then approached by street punks, loses it on them, then is almost killed in a drive-by shooting in retaliation, they miss &amp; he is calm &amp; collective as he steals their guns when they end up wrecking, now armed he is hungry, when he tries to order breakfast at the local restrurant, he is told that it is lunch time, one of the most memorable moments is the scene where he is on a pay phone &amp; a guy ask why he is taking so long, the response is a bullet riddled phone booth in which Douglas fire his guns &amp; says: &quot;it's out of order&quot;, Douglas plays this role to perfection as a disgruntled man who feels like life has cheated him, taking on a white-surprimast, angry golf players who knock a ball his way just for walking across the golf field, to a rude road construction worker who won't give a good reason for the road needing to be fixed(ever wonder what was wrong with the road that you thought was fine) Robert Duvall is the detective that pursues Douglas' mayhem, this film studies both men very well, as it does their fustrations, somthing that many of us could or do identify with, Duvall like Douglas feels out of place,his last day of retirement, &amp; yet you sense that his fellow officers can't wait for him to go, the ending is somewhat shallow, but it is a true depiction of modern day life fustrations that we have all encountered at one time or another.
B00005QZWI|5.0|The choice of Howard Shore and Enya were seriously inspired choices. The soundtrack is entirely suited to this most special of films. Just as with the Gladiator OST (Hans Zimmer &amp; Lisa Gerrard), the music seems from another time and another place. After the obligatory repeat viewing of the film, the music gives us the rare treat of conjuring up the various treasured parts of the tale as well as being quality listening in its own right. <br />This soundtrack is very highly recommended and would make a wonderful accompaniment, driving through the splendid New Zealand landscapes, seeing where the movie was filmed.
B00003CX5P|5.0|Although Episode 1 has been frequently put down, it compares favorably to the original Star Wars episodes (4-6). The Phantom Menace manages to couch victory for the bad guy (Darth Sidious who maneuvers Senator Palpatine into power) within a story which provides a superficial victory for the good guys.  Unlike the original Star Wars movies, Episode 1 has several storylines running in parallel, and not all is what it appears on the surface.  It was unfortunate enough to be come at the end of 17 years of expectations of millions of fans.  On its own merits it combines a fast-paced adventure with stunningly original scenes, settings, and characters.  The podrace is a terrific mixture of sight and sound, and the final duel with Darth Maul is beautifully choreographed and executed.  While Jar Jar Binks' antics are jarringly childish against the backdrop of the rest of the movie, he's only a minor annoyance for most, and younger kids find him entertaining.<br />The DVD itself is loaded with extras, including a thorough behind-the-scenes documentary which is worth seeing more than once just to get an idea of the work that went into the movie.  The audio commentary is interesting, but not the best I've heard.
6305077630|3.0|I searched forever for this movie.  After paying $30 to a lousy vendor, a vendor that took over 3 weeks to send my order, my patience was worn thin.<BR>No special features!<BR>When I see Weird Science on network TV at least they can show the cut scenes and enhanced soundtrack.  This DVD didn't have neither.<BR>The important thing that matters is the reason I bought it.<BR>My VHS tape was worn out and I thought DVD could be the answer.  This is a great movie and I had to have it after I threw out my tape.<BR>My advice to movie lovers, get the old movies quickly cause they are hard to find!
B00005QK3W|5.0|Some really pitiful reviews here.<br />Lennon would have loved the loose sound of this record. And if the melodies aren't initially catching, listen to it a few more times. They will be then. Flaming Pie sounded great to me at first, and now sounds dull and uninteresting. Driving Rain grows on you. Great vocals and playing.<br />Get off of Paul about the lyrics! Didn't Lennon write &quot;Goo Goo Goo Joob&quot; on &quot;I Am The Walrus??&quot; Didn't REM write about &quot;Shiny Happy People?&quot; Have you ever listened to the words to &quot;Whole Lotta Shaking Goin On?&quot; Rock lyrics are typically un-deep.<br />Listen to this one a few times and you'll love it.
B00005QXXO|5.0|If you love the band or have ever wanted to explain why they are so fantastic, you must buy this album.  &quot;Idioteque&quot; will blow you away and &quot;True Love Waits&quot; captures Thom at his finest.  I've played it for friends who have wondered how they sound live and they've been converted.  I absolutely felt like I was there in the venue with them and the quality of sound in phenominal.
B00004ZAV3|4.0|This product is great for the general Beatles fan, containing their chart-topping hits.  The only problem with this is that the Beatles were such a talented group many of their non-#1 hits are also classics-Please Please Me, Nowhere Man, Revolution, and the entirety of Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band which had no single.  This is why the rather odd \\"Ballad of John and Yoko\\" (#1 In UK), instead of a better song.<br />With a plethora of Beatles products, I recommend this for someone who wants the best of the best for their library.<br />The transfer to CD is superb!  The packaging is quite electric-hot and fiery red with scintillating yellow. It is quite an energetic package that catches your eye.  The simple \\"1\\" is a balanced composition for the small CD jewel case, and the psychedelic pictures capture the essence of the Beatles.<br />The only suggestion I would offer is that they do a 2-CD version of this with their top-ten hits, along the lines of the Elvis #1 and Elvis Top Ten hits. This would allow for a deeper appreciation for the Beatles talents and variety without buying a lot of filler material.
B00005LOUU|5.0|I just wanted to comment on the reviewer from Portland Maine...<br />It appears that you have totally missed the entire point of the story line...<br />THE GRINCH IS TOTALLY OBNOXIOUS - Full of himself, nasty, mean,and everything that Jim Carrey is (not mean, nasty) that is the whole idea...Did you not see or read the Dr. Seuss original book or movie???<br />I don't particularly care for Jim Carrey in any way manner shape or form..But I think that he was extremely well casted and perfect for the role...<br />The staging, lighting, special effects, music,  scenery, colors, colors, and colors were great...This is an extremely entertaining, and well suited family movie...
B00004XPPK|5.0|Moody, playful and captivating throughout, Gilda shines especially bright when Rita Hayworth is onscreen. Her confidence, beauty and brazenness literally took my breath away in scenes. This movie deserves five stars for her introduction scene alone. I highly recommend this film to fans of film noir and shockingly bold beauties.
B00005Q45W|5.0|The first time I listened to this album was on my fancy headphones and I almost instantly gave up on it.  That drum machine, geez!  The music, argh!  &quot;Get some real instruments!&quot;, I cried.<br />However, after giving it a few chances because of the lyrics I now can't stop listening.  Somehow the music fits nicely in the background behind Cohens crooked and Robinsons smooth voice.<br />The album feels like everything fits together better than it did on the two previous studio albums (the only other ones I have).  There's not really a bad track here.  Favorites includes Boogie Street, In My Secret Life and By The Rivers Dark.<br />As others have pointed out, the lyrics are great.<br />   O Crown of Light, O Darkened One,<BR>   I never thought we'd meet.<BR>   You kiss my lips, and then it's done:<BR>   I'm back on Boogie Street.
B00004T0P1|3.0|Though Dinosaur rests as Howard's most prominent stepping out point into mainstream success, and though he excels beyond some of his past efforts to create an exciting score, there is enough wrong with his music in this film to detract from the listening experience.  This album is one that is either on or off, based on the specific track and the action it accompanies onscreen.  At times, when the camera pulls back and Howard's score is given the opportunity to shine, he does indeed accomplish what one would hope in such an amazing movie.  But Howard fails to maintain this even beyond the moments when he is the focus.  There is no reason that he could not have acknowledged his minor place in the film and still maintained an underlying perfection that accented even the more mundane dialogue passages that did little to encourage any musical magic.<br />And that is what the critique of this CD comes down to: Magic.  Where dinosaur films come to play, it is hard not to compare this to some other classics.  John Williams' Jurassic Park had an almost contradictory beauty that didn't personify monsters, but ancient beauties.  James Horner's score for The Land Before Time is a spectacle of interesting and enchanting sounds that work to extend the majesty of dinosaurs despite their animated characterization.  Howard's Dinosaur, however, does nothing in the way of extenuating the magic, the mystery, the immense grandeur that a dinosaur civilization might possess.  What he does is unoriginally utilize stereotypical African percussion and chorus--that works wonders in its own right, but does little to personify an entire race of which mankind knows so little and is seeing for, perhaps, the first time.  Those percussive choral passages are, no doubt, stirring, but it leaves something to be desired, never creating an unidentifiable magic that the two prior dinosaur scores developed by crafting new sounds in order to define an elusive species.<br />Where the score does break out into choral and percussive beauty is where the score shines, but admittedly not as well as it could.  In between some truly inventive passages are some almost unlistenable action sequences that do little to enhance the listening experience--though this undoubtedly is more attributed to events in the story than Howard's composing technique.  Moreover, what Williams' and Horner's scores possess over Howard's is the emotion of the race.  In Dinosaur, there is little observable emotional theme to help relate to--and feel for--the main characters.  Certainly, not everything can be so candy-coated, but having witnessed the film for myself multiple times, there are certainly opportunities that could have warranted something resembling a love theme or sounds equally as sympathetic.  Instead, the listener discovers random periods of beauty--NOT magic--interspersed among unimportant and undesirable action music.  Surely, something so inspiring as a dinosaur film could have prompted even the least amount of emotion from the filmmakers and composer, but alas none is represented on the CD herein.<br />But, regardless, for those few tracks that manage to capture a truly amazing theme--one that undoubtedly surpasses many of Howard's other thematic attempts?and the added splendour of excellent percussion and a rousing choir, there is something to behold and to admire.  This music, in its own right, is not only above par, but surpasses most film scores--unfortunately, perhaps, it would have been more aptly presented in a film that was not so devoid of emotion as this one appears to be.  In short, this is a fine score at times, simply amazing to listen to, but given to a film that requires a more magical sound in a different style.  Dinosaurs remain a mystery to mankind; don't pervert their enchantment by limiting their emotions and addressing their music to common stereotypes.

B000003N7G|5.0|I'm sure whatever has been said about this album has already been said, but had to put in my $.02 worth.<br />This is one of the greatest jazz albums of all time, and Coltrane's greatest work.  Words alone can't describe how great this album is, and the chemistry between Coltrane and the other musicians is incredible from Elvin Jones' fluid and ever-changing drumming to McCoy Tyner piano which fits in perfectly with Coltrane's sax play.<br />I never get tired of listening to this album, and it doesn't matter what kind of music you normally like, everyone will enjoy listening to this masterpiece.

B0000033OZ|3.0|A pretty nice debut album for ELP from 1970, the same year they made their concert debut at the famous Isle of Wight festival (the same one where Jimi Hendrix and Jim Morrison made their final concert appearances).<br />The ELP sound is a bit raw compared to their later work, but their skills still shine since the three were already veterans of the music business.  The most recognizable track is &quot;Lucky Man&quot;, which is one of their signature songs.<br />A job well done, and an album worth listening to.
B00005RIKD|5.0|For ALL Sting fans this Album is a must have. Exellent Sound quality, and the most important: a fabulous Band; whose repertoire goes from Pop to modern Jazz. As i said before; a must have Album for Sting fans, but also for people who love good &quot;jazzy&quot; Music, performed by an oustanding Artist and his Band.<BR>Just enjoy the special arrangments on this superb CD!!!!
B00005RFQ5|5.0|His best work in over 10 years. This amazing body of music shows why he continues to be the modern day Mozart.
B00000AD94|4.0|The Light constituted my introduction to Spock's Beard. It's good enough that I want to hear more, but not so good that I don't want to hear more... you know what I mean?<br />The title track is spunky, eclectic, and, yes, long. &quot;Go the Way You Go&quot; and &quot;On the Edge&quot; are smaller-scale: less structurally complex and more immediately palatable. However, &quot;The Water&quot; crosses some line with me -- a line dividing &quot;interesting&quot; from &quot;obnoxious&quot;, so I tend to skip this track.<br />The frequent comparisons to Echolyn should be qualified; they don't sound like Echolyn, but I can see some similarities in their brand of &quot;progressiveness&quot;.<br />A good listen. I look forward to their later albums.
B00005QG9J|5.0|What IS typical of Incubus, anyway???  <br />Incubus knows how to break the lines and not stick to a so-called &quot;genre.&quot;  They definately know how to explore and incorporate different instruments in order to create a plethora of sounds.  I love the fact that none of their songs sound exactly the same, or rarely even similar at that.  Incubus are music gurus; they are one of the few bands of which can actually be said: Their sound is unlike any other out there.  <br />HIGHLY RECOMMENDED
B00005BJ2O|5.0|there is rarely a fantastic soundtrack that will be stuck in my head for the rest of the day with its haunting music.  the only other example that i can think of a fantastic soundtrack is the one from another movie by another Baz Luhrmann movie: Romeo and Juliet.  he has one excellent way to express the feelings of the characters in his movies by the soundtrack.  the music really represents Moulin Rouge from each character.  i saw the movie twice, and loved every moment of it.  and by just listening to the soundtrack clips from this website, i have found my new favorite cd, with the exception of two songs.  but since the maricles of cds, i can go right to my new cd and live in a peaceful bliss of the world of the moulin rouge.  it might just be my extreamly artistic side, as all of my friends have told me who dont like the movie, or it might be the increadible work of a genius.  i dont know, but he has the best way to make movies and music and intertwine them like magic, just like the extreamly unique gifts that he has given towards the sometimes ungreatful audience, opened only to the ones who are crazy, as some would say, like him, or just love his crazy way of expressing himself in extreamly unique and captivating way to show his artistic self.
B00003CX5P|4.0|A lot of the negative hype over this movie appear to be based on overblown expectations from &quot;growing up on the star wars mythos&quot;; promoting that series into something much more than it really was.<br />Viewed in it's own lights, and compared to other stories of the space opera genre of the 30s and 40s, we see a movie that actually holds up pretty well, has great special effects, and is a nice interesting &quot;flashback&quot; into the prehistory of the main star wars trilogy.<br />While there are some inconsistancies, few of the serials published in the 30s-50s didn't have their own sets of inconsistancies as well (I can't think of any offhand), so arguing about them is truely a task for hobgoblins.<br />If what you are looking for is pure entertainment, you enjoy state of the art CGI, (note the interesting and realistic gait on Jar Jar) and you're not too worried about having realistic physics (noise in a vaccum?) or have put the previous trilogy on an unobtainable pedastle (which with careful viewing, one might find it doesn't obtain either!), you'll enjoy Episode I.<br />No, it's not &quot;hard&quot; SF, but it is fun. Go into it without preconceptions, and you'll find it's worth the price of admission.
B00005OWIU|5.0|John Williams has done it again.  The music to &quot;Harry Potter&quot; is as captivating as the film.  This disc is wonderful because it is a true &quot;soundtrack&quot; -- if you listen to this disc before seeing the movie, you will find even more richness in the viewing. And, I love the way the main theme is carried through various pieces.  Williams' &quot;Christmas&quot; piece should become an instant classic!  Best of all, my children love it as much as I do so we can listen to it in the car!  This is a beautiful score performed brilliantly.  I cannot recommend it highly enough.
B00005OWIU|5.0|As a Williams fan, I know lots of his recent music. Harry Potter is a nice re-make of Hook. It isn't exactly a copy of Hook since the themes are entirely different. But the mood of the music reminds us Hook's magic. But since both movies are about some magic, it's not Williams' fault to do so. But there is a passage which is &quot;taken&quot; from &quot;The Lost World&quot; 12th. track. So, it's maybe the first time I hear Williams borrow his own music. But that doesn't make the album like Horner albums. It's a small passage and lots of people won't even catch it. But anyway, I would rate this album 4.5 stars but not 4. <BR>     So, definitely buy this one if you like Williams. It's 100% Williams and the &quot;Hedwig's Theme&quot; will surely catch you. It's really a great musical journey. Don't miss it.
0684843749|1.0|ARNIE, ARE YOU KIDDING ME??!?!?!?!?<BR>If you're new at bodybuilding DON'T READ THIS BOOK!!  His instructions are propostorous, his suggestions are ridiculous and his workout 'suggestions' are downright dangerous!!  I cannot fathom how a non-steroidal athlete could possibly workout the entire body as much as he suggests they should.  I'm sure that marathon workout sessions worked for him, but he is not like most people!<BR>  Have a look at photos of him when he was young and you can see that he was genetically perfect for the sport!  His arms swelled like balloons as soon as he started training.  Most people couldn't get that growth in a million years!  For him to use the principles that worked for him when he was at his 'non-steroidal prime' and recommend them to everyone is clearly the act of someone who has never had to deal with hardgainers!  If you do read this book, cut the workouts in half (or a third) and maybe then your body won't completely breakdown from overtraining.<BR>More isn't always better, no matter what Arnie says!
B00004W5UA|5.0|Okay, so this is about as `guy' as guy movies get, but, hey, I'm a guy, and I loved it.  An adaptation of the novel by Chuck Palahniuk, Fight Club shows up the ludicrous extremes of the male psyche in a brutal and adolescently honest way.  Our unnamed protagonist narrator (Edward Norton), slogging through life in the corporate world meets up with a hedonistic anarchist named Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt) on a plane.  And that's when the world gets turned on its head.  His condo destroyed in a mysterious explosion, our protagonist finds himself living with Durden in a ruined house in \\"a toxic waste part of town\\".  Lashing out at the frustrating impotence they feel as unwanted members of a lost generation, they begin fighting; first each other, in the parking lot of a local bar, and then other lost men who feel themselves unwanted and angry.  Throw in Helena Bonham Carter as Marla, the waifish and junkie-pale love interest for Tyler Durden, and you've got a tough combo to not pay rapt attention to.<BR>As an adaptation of Palahniuk's novel, Fight Club fits the bill in a first rate way.  The script remains entirely faithful to the novel (To an embarrassing extent:  Lines of dialog from the novel shoved into the actor's mouths in places they simply don't fit.  Bonham Carter mumbling out \\"They were burning off their fingerprints with lye.  The stink was awful.\\" as Norton hauls her down the street springs to mind.), both in content and, mostly, theme.<BR>The sheer anger of Palahnuik's characters shines through under director David Fincher's careful hand, as does Tyler Durden's grinning braggadocio, Marla's sighing disdain for the world, and the narrator's mix of latent anger and sheer wimpiness.  What's not played up in the script, however, is the novel's vision of the narrator, Tyler Durden, and Marla as existing in a love triangle in which Marla wants the narrator, the narrator wants Tyler, and Tyler wants Marla.  It may simply have been too much for scriptwriter Jim Ohls tofit into the movie, or, and this seems more likely, far too homoerotic for a Hollywood blockbuster.  If the latter is the case, however, Fincher managed to work around it by filming the fight scenes, in the dark and damp basement of the local bar whose parking lot provided the original arena, in deep intimate closeups showing the writhing bodies of half-naked men grappling, groping and twisting together.  The feeling is that of extreme intimacy, which, thematically, works well, but also lends itself to more alternative lifestyle explanations.  Conversly, the sex scenes in the movie, between Bonham Carter and Pitt, are shot in an exaggerated still frame, with a soundtrack of echoing moans laid overtop.  The mood is more that of posing, of reaching for an esthetic perfection rather than feeling any true passion.<BR>To me, the movie works better, in most ways, than the book.  The book's premise of men fighting in basements and on street corners works better as a visual than as described actions, and, really, Palahniuk's extremely spare writing style lends itself better to the narrator's constant internal questioning than it does to adequately describing the look on his face when Tyler Durden has him in a headlock and is ready to knock out half his teeth.<BR>What the movie lacks, though, is the novel's ability to give us nothing but our narrator's thoughts, which play a huge part in the narrative.  His feelings about his job, his boss, his parents, Marla, and the support groups he regularly attends are given lip service in the movie through extensive voiceovers, but mostly as a way to move the plot along.  In the novel, these are essential to the development of his character, and I feel that we get to know him in a considerably less intimate way in the film than in the book.<BR>But, as stated earlier, this is a top notch adaptation of a mostly cerebral novel, and the cast and crew should pat themselves on the back in congratulations of a job well done.  A movie that I've watched dozens of times, and expect to watch dozens of times more, Fight Club makes me cheer, makes me laugh, makes me cringe, and makes me almost like Brad Pitt.
6305263248|5.0|I chose this along with &quot;a Bridge Too Far&quot;, &quot;The Man who Would be King&quot; and &quot;O Brother, Where art Thou&quot; to start my DVD collection. All five star masterpieces of wit, action, and drama that I want to see again and again.
630170648X|5.0|The opening shows peacetime Poland, with shops owned by such as Rosnanski, Posnanski and Kubinski, all astonished to see Adolf Hitler, unaccompanied, strutting around their pavements. But he proves to be an actor, trying to test his make-up and Josef Tura's company is putting on a play about the Gestapo - the uniforms will come in handy later on!..........Today, TO BE OR NOT TO BE can be seen, and it certainly is by me, as one of Hollywood's most polished and perfectly controlled masterworks. Technically, it is one of the finest comedy screenplays ever constructed, a bravura piece of ensemble acting, of running gags which all pay off. The lines, dryly delivered, still evoke an appreciative smile. True, it takes a little time to warm up, and the heavy commentor sounds as though he had stayed from THE MARCH OF TIME. Jack Benny? Lubistch's choice at the time brought ripples of surprise and concealed mirth, but Benny was more than a brilliant stand-up comic. Given proper direction, as here, he was an accomplished comedy actor, never forcing to pace and well capable of handling the melodrama as well as the gags. As for LaLombard, this was, in her own opinion, her finest performance on film; she's brilliant and efficient, whether flirting with the flyer who can \\"drop three tons of dynamite in two minutes\\" or with the susceptible Siletsky - \\"Shall we drink to a blitzkrieg?\\" - \\"I prefer a slow encirclement\\". Tragically, Mrs. Clark Gable died in a plane crash later in the year.
B00000GAIW|5.0|This is one of Jethro Tull's greatest albums, but if you notice, you might have to turn the volume up on your stereo *much* louder than usual to hear the thing -- at least on the remastered copy that I own. That's the major complaint I have with this; it has nothing to do with the music, which is an easy 5 stars.<br /><br />Speaking of the music...<br /><br />Like Jethro Tull of usual, they create their unique brand of heavy rockers mixed with folk, jazz and classical with a touch of English Renaissance and medieval. Singer/flautist/main songwriter Ian Anderson has said that this was not intended to be a concept album, although one does sense a constant-running theme on the album. Speaking of the themes, this is not exactly a happy album. The subject matter deals with a homeless man named Aqualung (the first half), and the dishonesty of the church (second half.) To top it all off, the music has a cold, dry and wintry atmosphere to it; you can almost imagine the horror of being homeless on a bitterly cold, barren Winter day, when listening to this. Yet, it's an excellent album, and worthy of it's *classic* status.<br /><br />My favorites would be: \\"Aqualung\\"; a heavy-rocker with beautiful, yet ominous riffs, which give way to softer acoustic-like parts, with Ian's voice sounding a bit in the distance. \\"Cross-Eyed Mary\\" features Ian's quirky and sneering vocals, while \\"Mother Goose\\" and \\"Wond'ring Aloud\\" are beautiful English-folk/rock tunes. \\"My God\\" is a dramatic rocker with multi-sections, and features a middle-section of medieval choiral-like vocals fronted by Ian Anderson's orgasmic classically-tinged flute solos and overdubs. As beautiful as the music is, the lyrics are quite ugly and sarcastic, yet thought-provoking, and Ian sings in quite a fiery, scathing, and embittered tone throughout. \\"Hymn 43\\" is another rocker, this time with a heavier focus on jazzy soundscapes. \\"Locomotive Breath\\" is a rocker with sarcastic humor, and I can't help but laugh when I hear Ian Anderson's sneering vocals on this track. \\"Wind-Up\\" also continues the thought-provoking stream started earlier.<br /><br />The rest of the disc features bonus tracks. \\"Bouree\\" (a number by J.S. Bach) is arranged in D minor, and in jazzy/folk fashion. This is my personal favorite of these. (This track can also be found on 1969's _Stand Up_.)<br /><br />Overall, this is a Jethro Tull classic which will only continue to age very nicely, and is highly recommended for music lovers who are fans of \\"musical\\" music.vocals on this track. \\"Wind-Up\\" also continues the thought-provoking stream started earlier.

B00004Y87J|4.0|Many critics and viewers alike feel that this is one of Hitchcocks' finest films: viewer response to the film today is often as enthusiastic as when it was first released. One of the directors' favourite themes is used here: the innocent caught in bizarre circumstances that he or she doesn't understand. Particularly effective in the film are rapid changes of situation and Hitchcock's obvious contention that nothing is sacred, especially if a location or situation can be used to demonstrate the cleverness of his protagonist. There is a funny scene with Donat and Carroll, handcuffed together, pretending to be newlyweds &quot;forced&quot; to spend the night together. Visually, the film enabled Hitchcock to transfer some silent film techniques most effectively: the silent dialogue between Donat and the farmer's kind wife as seen through the window of the farmer's cottage is memorable as is the wind blowing curtains at a window on a stormy London night. There was no doubt that Hitchcock was a genius; he was the real star of the film; two modern remakes pale in comparison to this original gem from 1935.
B000021XS0|5.0|An oustanding album. This is where Dream Theater's musicianship shines best. Of course, many people already know that this is a concept album based on a murder mystery that is solved while a character named Nicholas is hypnotized. It's 77 minutes and is a rock opera in a literal sense as it is metal meets opera (Think, Queen/Queensryche/Metallica) sorry for the comparisons. While a great album, it is VERY grand and large-scale so at tmes, it can get tiring, and you must be in the mood for something like this (as with anything).<br /><br />Every track on here is dripping with jaw-dropping playing from every member of the band, but if I had to pick favorites, I would choose the following:  \\"Overture 1928\\"; a heavy, theatrical instrumental. \\"Fatal Tragedy\\"; one of the strongest tracks on here. The clip here on amazon lets you sample only a crumb of the track, as it starts off heavy and slow, then progresses into a fast paced metal frenzy with crazed guitar solos, crazed keyboard flourishes and whacked-out drumming. I also love how it has great melodious vocal overdubs. \\"Beyond This Life\\"; continues the story, once again with crazed musicianship, featuring a guitar/keyboard section reminiscent of Frank Zappa. \\"The Dance Of Eternity\\", is a 6-minute instrumental and probably Dream Theater at their most impressive musicianship-wise. It's a frenzied track with tempo and time changes that are insane (it has 13/16 and 14/16) with music ranging from jazz, ragtime and classical to the obvious metal. \\"One Last Time\\"; a slower, absorbing piece that ends on an operatic note. Beautiful. \\"Finally Free\\", is where the story really unravels, but I'm not going to spoil the ending, but you will find it on this track. \\"Home\\" (the longest track on here) is the track I never really liked that much; the Indianesque musings I found not to work well with Dream Theater's brand of music. It just seemed a bit tacky and contrived.<br /><br />Overall, an entertaining piece of work which is recommended for those that like music made on an epic-scale.at like music made on an epic-scale.
0790749556|5.0|When ROBERTA (the name of a chic fashion designer) was produced, Irene Dunne was the queen of the RKO lot, and the film was built around her.  Dunne sang - with her own voice - YESTERDAYS, LOVELY TO LOOK AT &amp; SMOKE GETS IN YOUR EYES.  Astaire and Rogers dance to LOVELY TO LOOK AT &amp; I WON'T DANCE; he and Ginger both sang and danced to the high-spirited I'LL BE HARD TO HANDLE.  If there are weak points in the film, they would include the blandness of Scott's personna and a too-long fashion show at the finale.  Notice the pretty blonde model who shows off a very expensive gown with ostrich feathers - it's 24 year-old Lucille Ball!!   The Otto Harbach-Jerome Kern musical ROBERTA caused a sensation on Broadway when it opened in the fall of 1933, due mainly to its enchanting song SMOKE GETS IN YOUR EYES. The original broadway cast included Bob Hope(!), Fred MacMurray and Sydney Greenstreet (!!); it enjoyed a 295-performance run.
B00000AOUD|5.0|This to me is Jethro Tull's finest work. A total masterpiece in the greatest sense of the word. I'm not even sure I can write a decent review for this album without sounding like an idiot. But I'll try anyway.<br /><br />It's a concept album about a young boy named Gerald Bostock (fake character), who writes a poem for a contest, but it is deemed offensive, and the boy gets disqualified. The lyrics are VERY complicated and understated, and to make a long story short, at least in my opinion, is based on the young boy's cynical outlook on life. But, you needn't worry about any of that, since the concept was mainly a big joke (or parody/spoof) by Ian Anderson & Company, and most importantly, the music is *so* overwhelmingly powerful and seductive, you won't care all that much about the lyrical meanings anyway.<br /><br />The music on here drowns in it's own sophistication, refinement and high-class; the musicianship and it's high-class is something that shouldn't be taken too lightly, and should be the envy of many a musician and a listener. It starts off with acoustic guitar, followed by the flute, then Ian's vocals. The piece takes off from there. From there you will find tremendous melody, some hard rock, folk, jazz, and classical influences combined with many different shifts in tempo and time, and the band pulls no punches, as musical ideas keep flowing and flowing into each other like one huge piece, until the climactic end. It's divided into two halves. To be quite honest, the whole thing sounds like one gigantic classical piece, only with rock added. Also, I arguably think the second half is the stronger of the two, as the grandiose first half gets turned up a notch or two to a full blown english renaissance drama.<br /><br />I can't say much more because I feel I'm at a lost for words. This is *indefinitely* one of my favorites in all of rock music, and music, period. If you REALLY like musical music, classical, jazz, folk or prog-rock in general, I think this is VERY ESSENTIAL and I highly recommend it to music lovers. It's *that* good.highly recommend it to music lovers. It's *that* good.
B00000JSPE|4.0|I can still remember the morning Robbie Williams 'left' Take That.  I was working in a factory, and the dizzy spell inspired by the news on the radio caused me to damage my hand.  I won't go into all the reasons for Take That's towering importance at that time in my life: suffice to say they were a pop lighthouse in the sea-fog of indie I was then listening to.  <br />But, Take That would only be of sociological or nostalgic significance, like the Bay City Rollers, if their only appeal was to the memory.  what makes them essential today are the still-dazzling songs.  the Take That aesthetic was very simple: for fast songs, a lead singer, strong, antiphonal backing vocals, a straightforward, chunky beat, and strings, whether synthesised or 'real'; ditto the ballads, in a lower register.  But the results!  'Back for Good', with its haunting mix of acoustic guitar, strings and almost choral backing vocals!  The breezepop of 'Everything changes'!  The neurotic, dark epic 'Babe', with its choppy violins!  The archetypal Take That single 'Pray'!  The eunuch-tastic 'Could It be magic?' with its amazing falsetto chorus!  My own treasured favourite, 'A Million Love Songs', with its sax and harp flourishes!  The staccato ecstasy of 'I Found Heaven'!<br />This is by no means a perfect compilation.  Sometimes Take That's ambition exceeded their reach - the Bee Gees cover is execrable; 'never Forget where you're coming from', with its mounting choirboy and gospel vocals, puts the 'm' into 'pop'.  the lightening disco pastiche 'Relight my fire' is soiled by screeching guest vocals.  At other times, Gary 'Ken' Barlow's desire to emulate Elton John and Level 42 are not always concealed.  The most overtly 'sexy' songs are anything but.  And it seems a shame to let this monument to the greatest singles band of the 90s fizzle out in a selection of charmless and tuneless 'bonus' tracks and camp remixes.  But with a judicious use of your select button, Take That could still be magic.  Now.

If you were unsure of purchasing this one, don't hesitate and buy it!  Enjoy it as much as I do.
B00005QZWJ|4.0|Howard Shore has once again shown the world what a great composer he is! After composing the music for (among others) the Silence of the Lambs, Striptease and se7en, he now let us hear that even the burden of composing the music for what's (most likely) going to be the biggest box-office hit ever, was not too heavy for him.<br />Some tracks remind of the bombastic Carmina Burana, and others have a calming Irish undertone. I am VERY curious of what the combination of the music and the film will be like, yet I'll have to wait another month! Alas!<br />Thekkur
B000000H48|5.0|To me there is no more gothic minded person than King Diamond. In the tradition of gothic artists: Edgar Allan Poe, Mary Shelly, Bram Stoker... King Diamond is the modern empitamy of what gothic really means. A song like &quot;At the Graves&quot; would make H.P. Lovecraft shiver. This album is wonderful as all of King Diamond's albums are, because King through his music has become the modern gothic story teller of our time. If you love gothic horror, or even horror in general pick up any King Diamond album, that catches your fancy. And listen, you might even learn something. The man is as intellectual as they come. Gothic Metal with a brain, that is what King Diamond performs.

B00000I7K4|5.0|... it's easy to complain about every little idiosyncricy that isn't making your heart melt.  belle & sebastian isn't just a band - they're people.  they're not perfect.  neither is their music, and depending on whether or not you love or hate it, that works for or against them.  <br />i myself have been delighted with every belle & sebastian release.  from 'tigermilk' to 'fold your hands child, you walk like a peasant'.  people just get a set image of what a band should be, and if the latest record doesn't sound exactly like the first then all hell breaks loose.  although comparisons to the smiths are everywhere and, in my opinion, not quite accurate, think of this:  how well did \\"how soon is now?\\" fit in with the rest of the album?  and why does it have to?  \\"electronic renaissance\\" is the added spark that makes the album work. ...<br />so keep adding to your critique.  look at the world through squinted eyes.  it doesn't change the truth.<br />tigermilk is lovely.  no matter what details you choose to add.
B00003CXZ4|5.0|This is the best movie I have seen this year.... and last year for that matter.  <BR>If you like movies that make your brain spin even after leaving the theater, then this movie is for you.
B00003CXS4|5.0|It's the same as Lock, Stock... I'll agree. Identical storyline. but I feel this film is superior, and alot funnier. I thought there were some hilarious scenes and a few little jokes that you might miss. I can't stop watching this movie. Some people must not get the British humour, or maybe Americans are stupid. I don't know what it is, but people just don't get the movie. It's like it is to hard to think about a movie, everyone's to use to Die Hard style plots. I enjoy this movie, and anyone who enjoys English humour or liked Lock, Stock, this is for you.
B000003EUL|5.0|Brahms was perhaps the musical heir of Beethoven.  His music provokes the same sort of strong emotion and passion that extends and magnifies the personal. My review will concentrate on the Beethoven piece.<br /> I can find no better illustration of this than Beethoven's Sonata no. 23 (op. 57 Appassionata) and the Brahms Piano Concertos (in this case the 2nd).  It is said that Beethoven was walking with a friend - I think Schindler - while humming a starnge and violent tune. beethoven excused himself and rushed home to set the tune to the piano. The architecture of the Sonata 23 is so complex that one can speak of actual orchestration.  It is full of wonderful deep bass chords and modulations.  The overall tone of the sonata is tragic and unlike a Chiopin nocturne its message is universalist.  It is much more epic prose than it is poetry.  I learned to love classical music after listening to the Appassionata when I was 5 years old.  I could not capture its full emotion then, but after 29 years the music till gives me shivers.  Although all three movements are excellent, The first contains three very distinct melodies that will haunt you, from a sweet central theme to a racuous ending.  The andante is a succession of variations that lead to a very 'violent' Presto finale.  It was Lenin's favorite piece of music.  enjoy this Revolution inspiring music for yourself.<br />The Brahms Concerto has the unusal characteristic of featuring 4 movements like a symphony and it is just as long as one.  Like the Appasiionata there are mixed moods and plenty of beautiful bass chords and melodies.<br />Sviatoslav Richter was considered to be one of the greatest Russian pianists (and world pianists) of this century.  the combination of music and interpreteer is hard to beat.  This iks an excellent CD.
B00003CXN4|1.0|This pointless drivel nearly spoiled my whole evening. God only knows how angry I'd have been if I had gone, in my car, to a cinema to watch it, instead of renting it. And if I'd taken someone I liked????... the mind boggled.<br />Isn't it obvious to everyone that this kind of stuff won't wash? They were still making movies about the Cold War when that great non-event was long over. Jack Lemmon once appeared in a film about &quot;Hippies&quot;. Someone will always bring these things to us I suppose.<br />Watching Michael Douglas burn his books like this made me want to do the Nazi salute at him. How can he agree to do such a deeply ignorant film? Is he so short of cash?
B00005OWIU|4.0|I enjoyed the soundtrack and could immediately identify it as a John Williams' score, but it doesn't have the power of Jaws, the Star Wars scores, or much of his other film music.  Good way to get kids listening to music though!
0783114222|5.0|This set of DVDs brilliantly captures the lives of the astronauts and the world around them at the time of the Apollo missions.<br />The special effects are pretty awesome too. Historically, these are mostly accurate too, and give a real feeling of being there. It rekindled my memories of sitting watching the events on TV as a child as it was so realistic!<br />It is so sad that the series was shown at strange hours here in the UK. Most of my friends who have seen some of the footage have now gone to the expense of getting region free DVD players and the US edition of the DVDs. This series is so good it becomes an obsession! This is by far the best work Tom Hanks has done for humanity - documenting history that historians seem to want to forget!<br />Buy it now. You won't regret it. I only wish a region 2 version was available....
B000006NXP|5.0|I always used to think Brahms was boring until I heard this recording.  It's not that I now think he's exciting, it's just that Kleiber reveals more than anyone else what makes Brahms so compelling.  I think Hurwitz put it perfectly saying that his interpretation is &quot;architectural&quot;: as cleanly articulated and massive as the Parthenon.  I only wish Kleiber made a complete Brahms or Beethoven cycle, cause they would just leave all others in the dust!
0887307280|5.0|A friend who understood how the contents would change my life forever introduced me to The E-Myth Revisited several months ago. Rarely has any business book provided me with such a fresh and clear vision how owner operated businesses can run better, more efficiently, more effectively, and with greater rewards for customers, employees and especially the owner. It's not just that small businesses don't work, it's about the business owner working too much, too hard with little room for a joyful co-existence with the business. E-Myth provides the solutions to a more rewarding experience for life and business. I believed so strongly in it's teachings that after 24 years in Corporate America I'm now a Certified E-Myth Consultant, coaching business owners the E-Myth Mastery Program
B00004Z459|5.0|I listen to a LOT of music, with most of it being in the rock genre.  I admit that I do like the rap/rock style of music, but usually tire of it quickly, and those cds end up in my room to be listened to rarely, and usually only one or two songs are worth it.  I got this cd b/c of a promotional feature from my music club, thinking that I'd probably just listen to it once and then put it away.  Boy, was I ever wrong.  It gets you from the first track and doesn't let go until the end.  I've had this cd for almost 2 months and it's rarely left my car's cd player.  It's awesome to drive to, awesome to sing to, and simply just awesome to listen to.  I like the fact that they don't feel the need to cuss every other word just to make the song enjoyable (unlike a certain Limp Bizkit song on their latest cd that has what, over 50 instances of swearing in one song, talk about overkill).  I love the beats in their songs and the fact that I don't feel like I'm listening to the same song over and over again.  I had my friend listen to it once, and from that one hearing, she went out and bought the cd and has been listening to it nonstop as well.  Before this, Incubus' Make Yourself cd was easily my favorite cd, but now, I'd have to say differently (although I absolutely love that cd as well).  I highly recommend this cd to anyone who loves rock, or the Nu-Rock as some term it.  It doesn't overkill the rap, in fact, even though it is a vital part of the cd, I don't feel like I'm listening to a rap cd.  The guitars and beats are phenomenal, and I'm afraid that I've annoyed quite a few of my neighbors by having this blasting 24-7.  If you're getting rather tired of the screaming of Limp Bizkit, the repetiveness of Kid Rock, and the same-sounding music of other bands in this genre, get this cd, it's a welcome relief and gives hope for those that feared that rock was getting completely deformed into something dull and ugly.
B00005OWIU|5.0|I think so, by far this ranks as one of the great soundtracks that exist. The other in my opinion is the Batman Returns Sountrack. But now, John Williams, this fits the movie very well. Instrumentation was excellent, perfect tonality for the orchestra. Although, while in the movie I thought it was Danny Elfman, (whose version of this I would kill to hear) Williams is undoubtedly heard via the horns, trumpets and the triumphant style he so greatly posses. These types of soundtracks are the best as they truly fit in the story as part of the Movie and not just music for the heck of it that belongs to the movie.
B00005JKOV|5.0|Here's a film explicitly for independant,open minded, critical thinkers. I've never seen as many people leave a theatre as during the first third of this movie. Now, if you enjoy a challenge, this flick functions on three levels. First, those with an eye for detail will appreciate the rotoscopic animation which is nothing short of a live action impressionism that Monet would have revelled in. There's tons of dreamy details in the background which reward multiple viewings. Secondly, the script is wall to wall with complex ideas and philosphies that you stop thinking about when you no longer have the luxery of late night chat sessions to ruminate on them. Very unlike the watered down stuff we're spoon fed in contemporary pop culture, it's a surprise to remind yourself you can still think this way without benefit of mind-altering substances. The philisophy lessons are further complicated by the urgent rythm of the dialog - each idea is like a cry for help. Finally, the overall narrative is almost impossible to distinguish if you're paying too much attention to the rest so be warned because it is there. A really good, trippy, engaging, four dimensional film. It'll frustrate you.
B00005QIPH|4.0|When I first heard &quot;Last Nite&quot; I thought &quot;well...it may be a little formula-sounding, but I Love this; I just want to hear it all the time!&quot;  After I bought this album, I was hoping the rest of the songs could deliver in the same way, and yes, I was surprised that I am thrilled to put it on, and hearing it in my head when it's quiet.<br />&quot;Take it or Leave it&quot; and &quot;Soma&quot; seem to be the featured songs lately.  I'd give it a whirl if you like the Replacements, the Verve, Ride, etc.  Great for a Friday nite.  I hope these guys go somewhere because I wouldn't mind hearing round two in a year or so...
0385505833|4.0|This novel came in the mail on Saturday and my wife and I had both completed reading it by Monday evening.  It's short (176 pages) and takes 5-6 hours to read.  More authors should try using the short novel format.  I have been so happy with Painted House and now Skipping Christmas as a change of pace from Grisham's legal thrillers.  Don't get me wrong, he is still the master of the legal thriller and I'll read The Summons within a week of its release, but with these last two stories, Grisham has proven that he is one of our top contemporary authors, in the same category with Irving and Crichton, at least in my opinion.  I was a little disappointed with the ending, but that doesn't take away from the fact that this is a great story that should soon become a Holiday classic.
B00005QXXO|5.0|Granted, I am a fervent collector of any five notes played or sung by Radiohead, but I wasn't expecting much from a live album.  I was so pleasantly surprised that they have developed these songs this much; I now have new appreciation for the ones featured here.  &quot;Spinning Plates&quot; is amazing.  Thom's weirdness and charisma and genius is always welcome to my eyes and ears.  They seem to get closer and closer to the soundtrack of my mind.<br />Even if you have Kid A and Amnesiac, I still think it's worth it to invest in these new versions.
014028009X|5.0|I didn't find this book &quot;hilarious&quot; and I didn't &quot;split a gut laughing&quot;, but I got quite a few smiles and even more chuckles out of it.  Just about every page had something cute or witty on it, which I found really enjoyable.    I could definitely relate to Bridget &amp; her eternal quests for happiness and a botfriend. Since there are so many reviews on this book explaining what it is about, I thought I'd write a few of my favorite lines from the book:<br />     &quot;I realize it has become too easy to find a diet to fit in with whatever you happen to feel like eating and that diets are not there to be picked and mixed but picked and stuck to, which is exactly what I shall begin to do once I've eaten this chocolate croissant.&quot;<br />     &quot;Maybe Dad will appear hanging upside down outside the window dressed as a Morris dancer, crash in and start hitting Mum over the head with a sheep's bladder; or suddenly fall facedown out of the airing cupboard with a plastic knife stuck in his back.  The only thing which can possibly get everything back on course is a Bloody Mary.  It's nearly afternoon after all.&quot;<br />     &quot;...just had cigarette, but no-smoking day does not start officially until I have gotten dressed.&quot;<br />     &quot;...so all I've got to do is find someone or something to have power over and then...oh G*d, I haven't even got power over my own hair.&quot;<br />     &quot;Twenty-two hours, four pizzas, one Indian takeaway, three packets of cigarettes and three bottles of champagne later, Daniel is still here.  I am in love.  I am also now between one and all of the following...a) back on thirty a day...b) engaged ... c) stupid... d) pregnant.&quot;<br />      Some of these quotes were taken out of context, but I still thought they were cute.  All in all, this is a very entertaining book, well worth the read...and it's a quick read, too, and makes for a fun weekend escape from reality.
B0000041Q3|3.0|This is generally accepted to be one of the best recordings available of Turandot. Well, you can't really go wrong with Monserrat Caballe (the &quot;definitive Liu&quot;, so more knowledgeable folk declare!) and Luciano Pavarotti (the definitive Italia 1990!!) being conducted by Zubin Mehta, so far be it from me to criticise execution of delivery of the work.<br />But the opera itself - well, if like me this opera lark is a new area to you, you may find Turandot's not a great one to listen to first.<br />For a start, the story line on the libretto is as flimsy as a balsa-wood deckchair bracing itself for the arrival of the Maestro's posterior. She's the most beautiful thing on the planet (and an Opera Soprano?? Is someone having a laugh?) but a bit frosty in her reception of likely lads - in the habit of ordering those who fail her riddles beheaded (on an equally flimsy pretext). But she will, she says, marry whoever solves the riddle ... BUT when our hero solves them, Turandot refuses to meet her part of the bargain! Now, she may be beautiful, but that's being a plain old bad sport. Opera over, surely! But no, of course not.<br />Why doesn't the kind old King, her father intervene? More to the point, why doesn't our hero tell her where to stick her riddles and get jiggy with the Slave Girl Liu instead? I guess that would be too obvious (not to mention dramatically satisfying). Instead, Liu eventually kills herself out of unrequited Love, and in the denouement (which to give him the benefit of the doubt I don't think Puccini actually wrote, having died two scenes from the end) Turandot finally gets the picture and declares her love. PAH!<br />Not exactly dramatically satisfying, is it?<br />But aside from that, the music is something of an acquired taste. Written twenty years into last century I get the feeling Puccini was (like Dvorak, apparently (!)) perhaps being influenced by the emerging film scores (maybe the otherway round, who knows) but to my conservative and untrained ears the emphasis isn't on building melodic figures and themes - there's a lot of discordance, the odd whole tone scale chucked in here and there there, some (nowadays) rather gauche sounding ying-tong-tiddle-i-po fills on the xylophone (just so you know we're in CHINA, listeners!) but not a great deal in the way of genuine, hum-a-long melody. Ok, Ok, two BIIIIIIIG exceptions to this are Liu's aria and Nessun Dorma (I think the understudy who finished the Opera for Puccini got it right by reprising Nessun Dorma at the end - I would have been deeply dissatisfied after two hours to only hear three minutes of it) but outside that the melodies are pretty hard to spot. This is ok if you're watching it live - it's sort of like incidental music for a film - you don't notice it so much, so you don't expect it to sound like anything in particular - but in the comfort of your armchair it's a pretty hard listen.<br />Until Pavarotti hits the straps with Nessun Dorma, of course. You'll be humming THAT the rest of the evening.e and untrained ears the emphasis isn't on building melodic figures and themes - there's a lot of discordance, the odd whole tone scale chucked in here and there there, some (nowadays) rather gauche sounding ying-tong-tiddle-i-po fills on the xylophone (just so you know we're in CHINA, listeners!) but not a great deal in the way of genuine, hum-a-long melody.

Prince has laid it down, no one can touch him.  Don't get too close he's on fire.  Check the title track &quot;Rainbow Children&quot; and &quot;Family Name&quot; this cat is off the charts.   You realize Prince was born from the union of funk and rock, and is back to claim his throne.
B00005QHPQ|5.0|This is a really great album for Enrique lovers and non-lovers too!  Very soothing!
B00005N9CV|4.0|While I do prefer her &quot;Love Scenes&quot; album over this one, I have to say that it is an improvement on her last album, &quot;When I look in your eyes&quot;. This one, even though there is an orchestra, it tends to compliment rather than take away from the songs. Plus the added bonus of having the great Christian McBride on bass, and Russell Malone on guitar. Her voice sounds a lot better than on her last cd too, richer and with more emotion. I thought her previous album was kinda flat and dull, and I almost didn't buy this album because of that. But after hearing &quot;S'Wonderful&quot; and the title song on the radio, I thought I'd give it a chance, and I'm glad I did. Diana is becoming a really good torch singer, and ballads are definately what she seems to do best.
0679441018|5.0|As mentioned in the beginning, being a vampire is not central to this tale.  It is the most theologically intriguing book I have read in years.  It succeeds in breaking up the formula of books 3 and 4, and while none of the chronicles can equal &quot;The Vampire Lestat&quot;, this one stands on equal ground with &quot;Interview...&quot;<br />...and like the first two, it can hold up on its own, not just as part of a continuing saga...
B00003CXXJ|5.0|Me encant esta pelcula, especialmente por la tcnica empleada en la realizacin de la misma y por como es manejado el humor en ella. Otra ventaja es que tiene el audio en multiples idiomas(Ingls, frances y Espaol). La recomiendo para ser vista en familia, se van a divertir bastante.
B000000OPZ|5.0|If you're looking for an album, from the 80's, that drives full throttle on all cylinders and in your face, look no further....you've found that album here....Whitesnake's self titled album! It opens with Crying In The Rain....a guitar blazing rocker which became a modest hit for Whitesnake. Song #3, Still Of The Night....an operatic rock song which charted well, and received round-the-clock air play on MTV in 1987! Song #4, a Whitesnake classic....Here I Go Again, displays David Coverdale's unique gritty vocals and great songwriting skills backed by smooth keyboards/synthesizers, driving bass and drum playing....Ansley Dunbar is one hell of a drummer....his skills are featured well on this album! Song #6, Is This Love, their power-ballad hit....it's played daily over KOIT 96.5 FM's airwaves, here in the Bay Area! I never grow tired of hearing this monster of a love song! The other songs on this album wouldn't be considered filler, to me. They are all unique in their own way....Children Of The Night would definitely have to be their most hardest rock song....crank up your stereo for this one!!!! Most remembered about Whitesnake's videos, from this album, is the heavenly body of Tawny Kitaen shown doing a summersault over Coverdale's car in a very thin, white silk dress(in Here I Go Again)....yeah baby!!!! Do yourself a favor by breaking out the plastic and ordering this CD, today! You'll thank yourself, soon after!
B00003CY5K|5.0|This was a great movie-- funny, smart, heartwarming and inspiring-- in spite of stupid trailers and bad reviews. I usually avoid the average teenage fare of dumb slapstick stupid guy humor like the plague.  But this movie develops a great story and characters with character, even the villains who you love to hate. Watch it and laugh, let your heart glow and your eyes fill. It's one of my favorite movies of the summer of 2001.
B00003CXTG|5.0|Why would anyone compare Pearl Harbour to Titanic is beyond me (limited intellect??)<BR>Where Titanic was very drawn, Pearl Harbour is very tight, the acting is quite ok, however the story comes through as it is intended to. It is not too sirupy and does not claim to be the biggest and best in movie history..<BR>All in all a very vieable and enjoyable movie.<BR>Well done.
B00003CXZ1|1.0|What is there to say? A ridiculously bad script paired with the muggings and poutiness of Jolie make this a really bad movie. Action fans rejoice - if you want things to explode every two seconds then this is your flick. If you want anything else (like dialogue, character development, you know...general things that make a movie good) go see another movie. I can see kids really liking this movie, but other than that just rent it and save your hard-earned money for a better DVD purchase.
0440425867|5.0|This book, now approaching its hundredth birthday, was one of the great discoveries of my childhood.  It's a little more demanding, perhaps, than most contemporary &quot;intermediate&quot; fiction, although it's possible that Harry Potter has opened some minds to the possibilities of this sort of fantasy.  I would recommend the sand-fairy series to any child who loves Harry Potter, the Chronicles of Narnia, or the wry works of John Bellairs.
B00005N9CV|3.0|I have seen Diana Krall in venues ranging from the intimacy of Blues Alley to the summer fun of Wolf Trap. I have all of her CDs and I have consistently hounded the local smooth jazz station to PLAY HER MUSIC. With that background, let me say that this CD is a VERY pale comparison to her earlier releases. Like other reviewers, I hope that Diana will slow down a bit (her concert schedule is insane) and return to the smaller, intimate sound where she shines like the brightest star.
B00004T8RK|1.0|This is the worst album I've ever bought. There is not one single song with any kind of a hook, and overall every song is depressing. I love Pearl Jam, but if they come out with another album like this I'd have to say they are dead.
B00005B36H|5.0|OK folks here is the review from an OGT fan - Lateralus is the best Tool album to date. No Question. Anybody who says Opiate, Undertow, or Aenima is a better production just likes that genre of music rather than the band itself.  Lateralus transcends the ground work layed by Aenima, moving beyond traditional songs to orchestrated pieces; defying normal chorus and timing balance.  In my opinion, they have found that fine line between hard rock and progressive rock that radio is simply not ready for (almost every song being over nine minutes doesn't help either!).  I'm not going to delve into the track lineup, except to say that the quasi title track, Lateralis, has the potential to change the way we view rock today; getting away from the uncomfortable industrial, hip hop, ultra hard core combinations that lack substance and creating an epic reminiscent of Led Zeppelin at their peak level of creativity.  I sincerely hope that music fans of any and every background give this album a chance since it is one of the few albums that can change the way people listen to music.
B00005QCVT|5.0|As with his first film PI Darren Aronofsky drains the audience with his gripping storytelling skills. If there ever was a movie to display the horrors of drugs, this is it.<br />A MUST SEE !
B00005RIKD|5.0|Well, what can you say this is one of the best live albums recorded by an artist. The album was recorded on Sept 11th (a dark day for all of us), which makes the album more special and unique.  Most of the songs have a different arrangements that the original versions. The outstanding tracks are:<br /> &quot;Mad About You&quot; which is not on the US/CANADA release<BR> &quot;Fragile&quot; the re-invented version, sounds like a brand new song and dedicated for those lost during Septemeber 11, 2001<BR> &quot;Don't Stand So Close to Me&quot; Great short version, very angelic and soothing<BR> &quot;When We Dance&quot; Good to hear Sting perform this song<BR> &quot;Fields of Gold&quot; sounds almost like the album version except for a few new arrangements, but regardless, a great version<br />I wished Sting could have recorded a new version of &quot;Desert Rose&quot; on this album.  Overall, all tracks sound very good.  Buy it and listen to album during these cold winters'nights.  A great holiday gift for your friends and family.
B000056JYC|5.0|If you weren't around in 76, let me just say that this album was HUGE! You know you've got a hit when kids who weren't really into rock and roll at all were even buying this album(although, if my memory serves me, my first copy was an eight-track)!<br />   This album catapulted Frampton to rock stardom. I remember seeing him on the Merve Griffin talk show. This album made all my friends and me want to be a rock guitar god. We all wanted to own a black Gibson Les Paul, just like Frampton.<br />    The great thing about this CD is it's remastered and sounds great! I put it in my CD player, and the sound blew me away. It's great to hear all the great cuts again --&quot;Something's Happening,&quot; &quot;Do you feel like I do,&quot; &quot;Baby, I love your way,&quot;--and others.
B00005RFAI|4.0|Pink's seconds album is no way as good as the first one!  The songs are pretty good themself, but she has changed her music style completely and it's not as good as the other one.  The lyrics and theme one or two of the songs of the song are very 'Pink' but they sound too pop like.  Highlights include 18 Wheeler, Numb and Get The Party Started, though the title track isn't bad either.  Unfortunatly, there are no more brilliant Most Girls or You Make Me Sick-like songs.  I've rated them all in my opinion..no ten's Im afraid, they all go to her old songs!<BR>M!ssundatood - 7/10 - a softer pop song that's good to sing along to.<BR>Don't Let Me Get Me - 7.5/10 - a fairly fast song that has a similar theme to the brilliant Split Personality, but the tune doesn't quite match it's standards.<BR>Just Like a Pill - 7/10 - you have to listen to this song several times to like it.  <BR>Get The Party Started - 8.5/10 - her first single from this album, a good, upbeat song.<BR>Respect - 8/10 - this song has a bit more attitude in it that the others.  Will have you all shouting out 'Ladies!'<BR>18 Wheeler - 8.5/10 I hated this song at first but after a few listen I really like it.  A pop song with a bit more rock base.  The chrous is pretty good.<BR>Family Portrait - 7/10 - this is a bit more like Pink's old style.  It has a serious message in it.  The song itself is good but I feel this doesn't really fit in an album like this.  Still a good song and the ending's good, but not the sort of thing to play at a club.<BR>Misery - 6/10 - this sounds like an B-side 70's ballad.  Her voice doesn't soun so good in this song.<BR>Dear Diary - 7/10 - a Britney style song, quite a nice ballad.<BR>Eventually - 5/10 - this ballad is pretty boring, is doesn't have much of a tune or anything.  Pink should have replaced it with a Respect cross Family Portait style song.<BR>Lonely Girl - 8/10 - quite a good ballad song.  It has a good chrous in it.<BR>Numb - 8.5 - a really cool upbeat song, similar to 18 Wheeler.  Good chrous, but it's quite a short song.<BR>Going to California - 6/10 - This is a pretty dull song, with little beat, base or decent lyrics.  It improves towards the end, but not very much.<BR>My Vietnam - 6.5/10 - this is a bit of a wierd song, very unusual.  I thought the lyrics were prettygood, but like Family Portrait, it doesn't really fit into today's style<BR>Overall, a solid album, no way as good as her first, but not a load of rubbish either.  Shame there are none of her trademark 'hit the boys up' songs about revenge and strong, single girls!  If you really like Pink and have a wide taste is music, then you should buy this.  If you only liked Pink's older singles, I'd give this a miss.
B00005RFQ5|5.0|Pros: Prince makes a spiritual and political statement without ignoring the music quality<br />Cons: Formatted just like \\"LoveSexy\\"; Entire CD is one track<br />(...)<br />In cyber promotions both on the NPGMusicClub site and elsewhere, the album was deemed \\"controversial\\". Being a newly converted Jehova&#8217;s Witness, Prince seems to have decided the make \\"The Rainbow Children\\" his showcase of his spiritual and political opinion. Therefore, if one were to disagree with any of his views, they would most likely dislike the album or particular song. Though this singles out those of his fans that aren&#8217;t spiritual in any sense of the word, Prince felt it his duty to make a statement. Surprisingly, the music on the album seemed to be his FIRST priority when making the album while the lyrics were a close second. Prince uses appealing genres of jazz, swing, rock, and funk to tell a story or provide a musical message of sorts. Despite the deep and hard to understand vocal alterations done on the interludes, each song is melded together so well that one might forget the whole hour plus album is not divided into tracks at all. As stated on some cyber promotions online, \\"The Rainbow Children\\" was meant to be experienced as a whole work rather than 15 or 16 pieces of music parted by occasional preachy interludes. Prince shows why he has been considered a musical genius for so long with this album. Each transition from song to song it smoothed out with a well placed instrumental or spoken word that directly links to the next song. He adds beautifully melted smooth grooves and funk driven toe tappers that will have fans of all ages talking about this album for years. Accompanying him is his trusted band called the New Power Generation including standouts Rhonda Smith on bass, John Blackwell on drums (amazing drum work on \\"Everywhere\\" track), and even jazz great Najee (flute and sax).<br />- \\"Rainbow Children\\" - a jazzy throw-back song with a soothing instrumental interlude just after<br />- \\"Muse 2 the Pharaoh\\" - a light hearted track spiced with a lot of spiritual meaning<br />- \\"Digital Garden\\" &#8211; an enchanting and hypnotic track laced with Prince&#8217;s unique guitar play<br />- \\"The Work &#8212; Pt. 1\\" &#8211; a funky dedication to James Brown with spiritual undertones<br />- \\"Everywhere\\" &#8211; a surprisingly uplifting track with powerful hornplay and choir-like vocals<br />- \\"The Sensual Everafter\\" &#8211; another soothing instrumental that calms your soul<br />- \\"Mellow\\" &#8211; just like the name of the track<br />- \\"1+1+1 Is 3\\" &#8211; a funk driven freestyle track with dynamic play on the keys<br />- \\"Deconstruction\\"<br />- \\"Wedding Feast\\" (interlude)<br />- \\"She Loves Me 4 Me\\" &#8211; a sedated love song<br />- \\"Family Name\\" &#8211; a declaration of spirituality and political views to a strong-willed track<br />- \\"The Everlasting Now\\" &#8211; a delightfully long declaration of Prince&#8217;s transition to his current faith; a funky jam session of instrument play and cuts from crowds screaming \\"We want Prince\\".<br />- \\"Last December\\" &#8211; the newest version of \\"Purple Rain\\", \\"The Cross\\", and \\"Holy River\\".

1561004847|5.0|I had the audio version of this classic in my car.  Someone broke into the car and tried to steal the radio but was not able to--but they did get away with this audio tape.  Now, I know there is a car thief somewhere in this area listening to Pride and Prejudice, and I hope they enjoy it.<br />I compare this book with a comfort food.  For me, it is a comfort book.  When I have nothing else to read (seldom) and don't want to read any more murder mysteries or genre fiction, I reach for this book as it always brings me joy and pleasure.
B00000DFSK|5.0|I'm only 13 years old and got into music at the beginning of this year. I was at my local Borders' CD section and decided to try out a band where five CDs were on display. The band was U2, the CD was &quot;War&quot;, and the song was &quot;Sunday Bloody Sunday&quot;. I did not immediately become a fan, but I was intrigued and did some research. I'm sure you probably know the history and members of the band and trivia and stuff so I won't bore you.<br />Some time later I bought this CD. I saw it as a collection of 14 great songs. (15 actually, plus the hidden track). It was my first real start on the band. However it did make a slightly confusing listen due to the non-chronological sequencing...it was hard to see the evolution of the band over the 9 years. Plus this CD is only 65 minutes long. The Beatles recently released &quot;1&quot; compilation ran 80 minutes. Another two to three songs could have squeezed in, such as &quot;Gloria&quot;, &quot;Seconds&quot;, &quot;40&quot; or &quot;Two Hears Beat As One&quot;, all glaringly missing (hell they could've saved a minute without sticking &quot;October&quot; as a hidden track). Still, this got me started on U2, and fellow newbies would do well to get this. Fans who have been following the band since the 80s, however, probably don't need this unless they're completists.
B00005ASHM|5.0|If you can listen to this and not feel moved your obviously not a human being. If you can listen to this and not cry--youve obviously never been in love. If you can listen to this and notwonder about relationships--you obviously have no heart.To all those people out there who bash this album*beware the darkside of the force*
B00003CXZ4|5.0|The film, as you know by now, tells the story of the protagonist by presenting his events backwards in time. Simultaneously, the film tells a forward moving parallel story of a similarly affected person.  The hero of the piece is a puppet without his awareness and you wish that he never knows the extent of his manipulation by the good folk that populate his world.  Never ever boring and occasionally gripping, this movie is a movie lover's movie.  It is an essential to any discriminating viewer's personal catalog.  Group viewing is best for the conversation that the movie compels.
0521397812|4.0|Five-minute Activities contains over 130 ideas for the foreign language classroom in its 100 pages. I read this book from cover to cover, and was pleased to be able to make many notes for my future lessons. Some of the activities are actually quite common, and perhaps most teachers would be aware of them, but there were many good ones that I'd never come across, including a few gems. Some are literally five-minute fillers, while others are worthy of spending maybe a whole lesson on. If I had to make a tentative criticism, it'd be that many of the suggestions have students generating language that would never be heard beyond the walls of an EFL classroom. For example, &quot;A pencil is thinner than an elephant.&quot; I have mixed feelings about whether this is such a bad thing or not. On the one hand, students can practice structurally correct forms of language and learn whilst having fun. On the other hand, Five-minute Activities doesn't really present them with many opportunities to practise for situations in the real world, which may, of course, not be as fun. Also, I felt that there was a bias for activities that focused on self-disclosure, or competing to be the best in the class. Great, perhaps, for European or South American students of English, but not quite so good for students at my secondary school here in Japan. Overall, I'm pleased to have this book for reference, and I'd recommend it to most of my colleagues, even if some of the suggestions reminded me of what it used to be like as a pupil at a British elementary school.
B000000645|4.0|The ISB is not a band for serious music listeners. If I were talking about them in that context, every album would be a 1-star or less. Robin Williamson (for sure!) and Mike Heron (probably) are both sterling musicians who have done great stuff musically, but ISB was simply never a serious technical effort on their part.<br />This said, I am a stalwart ISB fan and probably will be for the rest of my life. This CD is my second favorite of theirs that I have, with &quot;500 Spirits or the Layers of the Onion&quot; being my first. Overall, it is a sort of mushroom-music masterpiece, and no other ISB album is quite so precisely psychedelically engineered. The first song, Williamson's unpronounceable &quot;Koeeoaddi There&quot;, is a cooler trip through someone's consciousness than anything you'll find on Sgt Pepper, and there's a part in there where Robin sings about &quot;skating on Happy Valley Pond&quot; with sitar and jews-harp blending in a very mesmerisingly swaying waltz that comes as close to musical genius as ISB ever gets. &quot;The Minotaur's Song&quot; is probably an influence on Monty Python's &quot;Lumberjack Song&quot;. &quot;Witches Hat&quot;, my favorite song on here, is a children's song with a paradoxically dark undertone musically, although the lyrics are pure whimsy; Robin la-las away like a dancing gnome while a bouncy hammer-dulcimer alternates with dorian Renaissance guitar licks. <br />I have never liked Mike Heron's work very much, and &quot;Cellular Song&quot; is no exception: it is stupid, pretentious and way too long, but I have found that young pagan or hippy girls seem to love it and all his other songs too, if that is of any use to you. Most annoying of all is the fact that it is interpolated by the sappiest version of the American southern spiritual &quot;I Bid You Goodnight&quot; that ever was...a great song, which ISB should have left to pros like the Grateful Dead. Another of his songs, &quot;Mercy I Cry City&quot;, also grates on theears, although the lyrics are interesting and easily related to by country boys like me. &quot;Waltz of the New Moon&quot; would be gorgeous were it not for the mix: the harpsichord is so much louder than the other instruments that it's intrusive, but a good EQ can remedy this somewhat. &quot;Water Song&quot; is beautiful too, and a great anthem for people with a special affinity for the element, but the sound effects will make you want to pee. &quot;Three Is A Green Crown&quot; follows the other Williamson tunes' examples of beautifully imaged stream-of-consciousness meditation songs. &quot;Swift As the Wind&quot; is a Heron song about a little child having Judeo-Christian dogma-induced nightmares, and would be pretty good if it were at all musically listenable; as it is, it's simply unintentionally hillarious. &quot;Nightfall&quot;, the coda, is probably the song on the album that is most effective at what it tries to do, which is to put you to sleep: Williamson's soothing croon and Heron's lazily buzzing sitar could calm a raging acid-freak into slumber. <br />In all, one of the best hallucinogen-music albums ever made.
6305165912|5.0|Witty, outrageous, original - comedy doesn't get much better than this.  The Cohen brothers really outdid themselves with this insane group of characters.  The casting might be called perfect, because each part was written specifically for the actor that played it.  This is a must have for all comedy fans!
B00005K3OT|2.0|I did not like how this movie sterotype it character's.  I have a hard time accepting a good natured athiest who seem's to now what is best for everybody.  On the religious side they all then to be the unsymabethic and either extreme or weak with no substance to their belief's.  Just because a person is religious does not make him right.  The mayor was controlling and was a poor example for a relighous leader.  What I did not like was that the movie dealt with extrems.  I cannot see many town people fallowing a mayor who is so controlling.  A priest who stands for the mayor rewriting his sermons &quot;I don't think so&quot;. Can a town possibly be this repress.  Then comes the lady with the chocolat and the knowing smile. She pushes all the right button's.  That's the problem. Two extrems and no middle ground.  Know if you have two character's who had there difference's but both had good strong belief's but did not see eye to eye.  Then you would have a good movie.  But this movie telegraph it punches. It is the lazy way out.  It is easey when you deal with extreams.   But you need more thought when you are dealing with honest difference's or deep rooted belief's.  It take's more than a cup of chocolat.
B00005NEZ3|4.0|Despite what one reviewer here might have you believe, Damon Albarn, co-creator of Gorillaz and singer of Blur, is not anti-American. He disliked it for a while, sure, because Blur had bad experiences in the early years with their record company. And those &quot;quaint songs about men chasing women&quot; and such are meant as satire of English stereotypes, not glorifying of them. Well, I'm off point here. That was then, this is now...and after six albums from the terrific Blur and only one US hit (that fact makes me very sad indeed...) Damon's finally hit the big time with this project. This is a very diverse record, fairly rambling at times but with some great tunes. There's something here for just about anyone...if you were attracted by the funky groove of &quot;clint eastwood&quot; you may well like 5/4, Tomorrow Comes Today or 19-2000. If hip-hop or rap is your thing...say, the rap is your favourite part of CE, Rock the House is for you. There's pretty, blissed out slow songs like Slow Country (a personal favourite, if only for the way Damon sings &quot;whatchoo doin'?&quot;) and more driving rockers (M1A1, Punk) that recall some of Blur's earlier, punky material. A few weak moments keep this from getting a five, but overall an intriguing listen. And if you're like me and aren't fond of profanity, this edited version is a good choice...not much is removed, since there only appear to be two songs with any cursing.
B00005QK3W|2.0|Mccartney is one of the best melodists of the past 100 years and it is always an event to hear anything new from his pen.

Keep turning them out, though, Paul! We need you!

Second, I hate that kid who plays Anakin. Third, the pod race was a bit too long for my taste. After a while, it made me seem as though lucas didn't have enough material for the movie, so he pumped the movie with pod racing. Other than that, I gotta wait for the Attack of the Clones!!

0385505833|3.0|This quick, laugh-out-loud funny book really caught me up in the spirit of no Christmas.  He makes a novel out of a hypothetical \\"What if...we skip Christmas silliness?\\" idea, and makes some good points about the craziness of the holidays.  But it seems Grisham didn't care to ever describe the relationship between the main character and his wife, and at the end the book took a completely stupid twist.  I mean, who would really rearrange their $3000 Christmas cruise for a kid they'd only not seen for a month who unexpectedly comes home with a (probably temporary) fiance?  You'd have to be a sniveling (...)to do something like that, and in the space of a page I completely lost respect for the 2 main characters.  I couldn't even laugh at the absurdity of it all because I don't know anyone that would do something so weak and (...).  I only gave this book 3 stars because of its easy flow and novel subject idea.  Ack!
B00005RFQ5|5.0|It never ceases to amaze me how often this man switches gears and comes out on top of the dung heap.

Just look at Shakira...she was already a huge world success, so why does she have to start looking and acting like Britney spears??? Oh well.<BR><br />Back to the case at hand....<BR>This cd is so full of magic that at first listen, I felt like a little kid going to an amusement park. Every song made me go 'wow! incredible'. <br />Taking a major jazz tone throughout the whole cd (likened to a modern Miles approach) and adding some of the most amazing guitar work from his royal badness; the cd turns and swirls and makes you want more. Larry Graham is back once more and his playing shines as usual. BUt let's not lose sight of what the review is about...the songs. And boy do these songs move me. <br />Scaling back from the rock and and sometimes plascticine neo soul he has been doing, he goes straight for the funk and jazz and he has never sounded better vocally. But don't let the absence of rock fool you.....there are more guitar solos and more guitar pieces on this album than any Prince release in the past. And I have to honestly say that i was extremely impressed with his playing like I was never before.<br />Any Prince fan will no doubt, already have this but if you debated about getting it...RUN to the store now and do yourself a favor in picking up the first truly classic cd of the new millenium
0800187814|5.0|such a controversial, engrossing film about larry and althea, who suprisingly have a wonderfully entertaining relationship and about larry's published hustler. all of it sparked and still does, up all sorts of arguments about the rights of &quot;porn&quot; and the first ammendment. you have to relize that you are gonna learn a lot from this film, and about the person next to you, from debating and all, when you watch this film. one of my favorite films, with such great characters that all seem to hold a common chemistry. its a great movie based on the rights of people and their uh... entertainment (some thought the movie was bad and that all should just dump something they hate in the trash, but that doesnt mean everyone hates that particular thing), and asking the nations questions likeb'has porn gone too far and/or should it just be taken out permanently? are these people pigs or what.'  It doesnt take half a brain to relize that not everyone is going to enjoy this film. but if you like any of the actors, the story, porn, rights or whatever and have a free mind go ahead and watch.  at the very least you should find out something about your beliefs, whatever they may be, and will find it entertaining.  it most likely will become a favorite of yours too.  such a great director and cast. woody and courtney love do a completely brilliant job.
B00001NFCY|5.0|Simple. Creed write GREAT lyrics...WITH meaning.( Now there's something many of their critics lack...) HUMAN CLAY is a great representative of these qualities.(Now there is a word sending many music fans to their lexicons...) If you don't like it...fine.  But what if...you just don't get it?
B00000DHRZ|4.0|well the cd was good, since it contained sarcasm, but something was missing.  it was cool, but it isn't great.  i'll give an honest song by song account of this trully understated album, (sometimes an old offspring glimmer shows through & in some ways this album has a sort of youth driven magic.)<BR>2. a pretty good song, with a nice beat, predictible<BR>3. wonderful, even the lyrics are great.  the end (is bad).<BR>4. good when your in the mood, got old quick though<BR>5. such a great song, from begining to end, spectacular lyrics.<BR>6. sounds like fake anger, somewhat likeable<BR>7. the lyrics are funny but other wise it was ripped off<BR>8. the lyrics are funny, again, but its a forgettable song<BR>9. i like the desperation in this song<BR>10. ok<BR>11. i like this one, even the video<BR>12. starts out slow but its still a real good song<BR>13. actually even though it has a long intro its still cool<br />all in all the offspring are one of my fave bands, they do everything so well, i have nothing to say. theyre noteworthy so i couldnt give them a three.  this is their worst album, and its a 4. now thats saying something.
B00005RFQ5|2.0|I'm a loyal Prince fan - I have every one of his albums; and I have to say he has sunk to a new low with this one. The music is ok - sort of jazzy and weird. However, the lyrics and the whole concept of this album just seem dumb. He should stay away from sweeping concept albums. I would easily rate this as his worst and a major dissapointment.  (By the way)the album is NOT all one track - you can skip from track to track if you want to.
6304297912|5.0|I love this movie, it;s especially great when your watching it for the first time.  i love the soundtrack too.  it's an entertaining story for our generation that almost never seems to slow down.  really fast paced and engrossing. no matter who  you are you'll gain something from this film.
0804115613|5.0|Wow!  I LOVED this book.  What an incredible mixture of characters and a plot that will have you looking forward to the next page.  You will love the protagonists, hate the antagonists, and you'll be dying to discuss all of it once you've finished the book.  I guarantee that you will indentify with at least one character in at least one situation.  Do yourself a favor: read this book and forget the movie.  The movie was good, but doesn't hold a candle to the book.  Naturally.

B00000IB4D|4.0|This is the 5th album by the &quot;Santana band&quot;, but by this point the only guys remaining from the Woodstock lineup were Carlos, drummer Mike Shrieve, and percussionist Chepito Areas.  They were joined by two (!) keyboardists (Richard Kermode and Tom Coster), percussionist Armando Peraza, bassist Doug Rauch and vocalist Leon Thomas.  Carlos's chief collaborators in the band were Coster and Shrieve, who pulled the band in a decidedly jazzy direction.  The overall sound is even mellower than Caravanserai and pretty far removed from the classic Santana sound.<br />  Santana was never a great songwriting group, and so the meat of the album lies in the instrumental pieces.  There's a beautiful arrangement by Alice Coltrane (&quot;Going Home&quot;), a serene interpretation of John Coltrane's &quot;Welcome&quot; (listen to Trane's original on Kulu Se Mama, it is heartbreakingly beautiful!), Chepito's very cool &quot;Samba de Sausalito&quot;, and an intriguing cover of Herbie Mann's &quot;Mother Africa&quot; with the angular soprano sax playing of Jules Broussard.  In addition, &quot;Flame Sky&quot; reunites Carlos and John McLaughlin in a fiery duel that easily exceeds anything they did on their collaboration Love Devotion and Surrender.  The vocal tunes are mostly R&amp;B-ish with the smooth vocals of Leon Thomas (I wonder why he didn't contribute any of his trademark yodelling), plus Flora Purim's classic voice on &quot;Yours Is the Light&quot;.<br />  This isn't an unqualified triumph, but people who like jazz-rock or this phase of Santana's career need to pick it up.  Caravanserai is a stronger album, though, so check out that one first.
1583762027|3.0|Is life more fun when your are excited and motivated?  Can you get more done then?<br />What idea do you think Mr. Tracy uses to get you in that mood?  You can probably guess from the title.  He wants you to think about your biggest and most important challenge (that you are most likely to put off) as a big, ugly, live frog that you are going to eat first thing every morning.  Now, that should really turn you on!  No?  Well, I guess you're not bloodthirsty enough to make a big success then.<br />All kidding aside, except for the poor choice of metaphor this is a pretty good book.  It combines in 21 rules the key points from many people who have written well about time management including Peter Drucker, Alex Mackenzie, Alan Lakein, and Stephen Covey.  So you can save a lot of time by reading this book instead of many others.<br />I would like to compliment Mr. Tracy for giving full credit to most of those whose ideas he uses, which he did not always do in the books he wrote in the past.<br />The sections are short in this book, and many pages are blank.  Most people could read this book without rushing in less than two hours.<br />You are encouraged to use all 21 rules, and there's an exercise at the end of each rule to help you get experience.  He feels that following these rules for 21 days will be enough to form a new set of habits.  Many behavioral researchers would argue that it takes longer.<br />Mr. Tracy has applied all 21 of these rules in his own life, and testifies to their effectiveness.  His key message is to spend your working time on what will do you the most good and skip doing the rest, and he gives you several ideas to identify what those areas are and how to make psychological and skill progress in them.  For example, you should first do those things that will make you more successful in the key aspects of your job.  To get more time to work on self-improvement, give up on watching television and listen to audio tapes on these subjects while driving.<br />The book has three minor weaknesses.  First, time management is viewed as a discipline . . . with little emphasis on the inspirational.  If you had to do something unpleasant to save the life of your child, you would easily feel inspired to do so.  If you had to do the same thing to meet a personal plan for self-improvement, would you be inspired enough?  Although the book talks about getting inspired, it seems to rely on a taste for self-discipline that many lack.<br />Second, Mr. Tracy writes in aphorisms that are often not explained.  As a result, it isn't always clear what he is talking about.  The material is highly condensed in this way, and you will often wonder why he is telling you what he is telling you.  For example, he tells you to stay away from white flour.  Now, unless you have read a lot about how white flour affects your blood chemistry to cause your blood sugar to crash and make you feel tired while your body burns less fat so you gain weight (which also makes you more sluggish), you would never be quite sure what all this has to do with time management<br />Third, Mr. Tracy's 21 rules could have easily been condensed into many fewer, which would have made them easier to remember and saved you time in learning how to apply them.  He also projects many personal preferences onto everyone else.  For example, he wants to be sure that you sit up straight as you work.  I couldn't quite figure out how that helps with time management.  Maybe you avoid having to see a chiropractor, and that saves time.<br />What is your idea of a compelling life?  What would create a compelling life for you?  What are you not yet doing that's necessary?

B00005RFAI|2.0|As the amazon.com reviewer points out, this CD is NOTHING like Pink's first.  If you loved that one, as I did, you most likely will NOT love this one.  Her infectious dance/R&amp;B songs on the first disc were a whole lotta fun.  This time out, Pink wants to be a rock chick, and her efforts in that regard do absolutely nothing for me.  That doesn't mean you won't like the new disc; just try and hear it before buying it so you don't make the same mistake I did!
B00005OWIU|4.0|I bought the CD with eager anticipation as soon as it came out.  Let's face it:  blockbuster movie + beloved character and book series + John Williams has the making for something special.  Once I started playing it, I was not disappointed.  <br />The Prologue and Harry's Wonderful World are a great way to start the experience.  The theme is very memorable (I'm sure a few people out there who have seen the movie came out humming it as well - I did), and it has a nice magical and childlike quality.  The rest of the score is rather nice too. Some of the later tracks have some nice power to them.  There are some low points (as with some John Williams scores), but overall it is very satisfying.  Yes, there is some &quot;Hook-like&quot; feel to it, and it can remind you of other movies at some points, but it also has an identity all its own.<br />Is it the greatest soundtrack ever?  No.  But it captures the feel of the books and J.K. Rowlings wonderful characters (and yes, Mr. Williams, it works great for the movie itself).  The best way I can illustrate this is a friend who had not read any of the books asked if the stories were like Tolkien's Lord of the Rings.  I simply played the first few tracks of this CD, and said this should give you a flavor for the mood of the books and the magical qualities of the stories.  He understood completely.<br />Overall, a very nice musical score.  Now, back to my humming.
B00005N9CV|2.0|Diana Krall's voice is splendid as always, but &quot;The Look of Love&quot; lacks the soul and wit of her earlier releases.
B00005QK3W|5.0|With very few exceptions Paul McCartney has during his solo career veered between albums that are so over produced as to be cloying and albums that appear to be dashed off so quickly with songs that are so sketchy that you are amazed that this is the same person who wrote some of the best songs of the second half of the 20th century. Flaming Pie tended to the former, but he managed to make it work and Driving Rain tends to the latter, but again he manages to make it work. Recorded with a group of unknowns, which each song recorded quickly the songs are simple and underwritten. Yet, they are catchy, get under your skin and work wlll in their simplicity. While many are silly love songs (Driving Rain) they never sink to the level of banality of Silly Love Songs or Let Em In (two of the worst songs and certainly the worst hits of Paul McCartney). In sum it is a totally charming album.
0060987464|5.0|I highly recommend this book to any fan of Marilyn Manson's, but even more so to the people who dislike him.  It clears up so many of the rumors and delves into what made him who and what he is.  Personally I've read it through five times already because it is very interesting.  Anyone can relate to him (believe it or not) after reading his story.  Enjoy!
B00005QZWI|5.0|This is the best soundtrack of the year if not one of the best ones period. Howard Shore gives us a great moody epic sound that actually captures the book very well in some places. As stand alone music this is fantastic, whether it's the flute and fiddle ballad of &quot;Concerning Hobbits&quot; or the heart pounding notes which resonate from &quot; A knife in the dark&quot; you can't go wrong here. Can't wait to see how this coincides with the films!
B00005T343|1.0|Okay, I would just like to say that this movie should have come before the first one. I'm not sure if that is what was meant to happen or what.  You know, like how Star Wars Episode One: Phantom Menace blah blah blah came out like 20 years after the first movie?  Well, this movie is just . . . it doesn't really have much to offer except for more blood and gore and what it has is just plain GROSS!!! I'm still ready to heave cuz of a scene towards the end of the movie that I can NOT shake from my . . . dare I say it. . . brain!  There was just senseless grotesque human violence and death in this movie and it kind of downed my opinion of Anthony Hopkins and his choice of actings moments to add to his repetoire!  I'm serious, if you don't like slow moving movies that have high points of &quot;bring up your food&quot; moments RUN AWAY from this movie!!  I'd heard that there was more death scenes in this movie and that it almost had nothing to do with it's predecessor and I should have, for once, heeded the advice. This is just plain ridiculous!!  Now you'll have to excuse me while I go bring up my meal!
B0000025ZF|4.0|Roger Waters 1st solo album after his departure from Pink Floyd, The Pros and Cons of Hitch Hiking is not an album that will seduce your musical tastes in 1, 2, possibly even 3 listening sessions. This album takes time to truely appreciate the brilliance in arrangement, production, composition and musicianship. It features Eric Claptan on electric and acoustic guitars in which he plays all over the album and let me tell you, he burns it up!!!!! On sax you have David Sanborn, need I say more. Pros and Cons is a concept album, it should definitely be listined to in one sitting(It will make much more sense). The interplay with acoustic and electric guitars along with fabulous dynamics is awesome. Bottom line, if your a Roger Waters fan this album sneaks up on you and will blow you away, if your not a Waters fan it's not for the lighthearted, purchase one of gilmore's solo albums.
080017948X|5.0|Have you ever had one of those days, where you wake up and you have a strong sense of deja vu -- as if you've lived through this moment before?  Overbearing TV weatherman Phil Connors (played Bill Murray) gets a whole series of such days, in which he literally re-lives the same day (Groundhog Day) again and again.<br />This comedy blossoms under Murray's radiant comic genius, as we are gifted with a whole series of his outrageous attempts to get through the day as fast as possible, as selfishly as possible, or with as much self-importance as possible.  Eventually, Connors comes to discover that the most joy comes from helping others, as he finds himself falling head-over-heels in love with his lovely (and not easily impressed) TV producer, played by Andie MacDowell.<br />Supporting actor Chris Elliott is extremely funny, and this film is so good that you'll find yourself wanting to watch it again... and again... and again!
B00000K3D4|4.0|This is an excellent fantasy film for all ages.  It gathers it's strength from Jim Henson's always-impressive team of puppeteers and especially from Monty Python alum Terry Jones' great script.  Jones has written some very successful children's literature and was an inspired choice for screenwriter.  He brings his familiar brand of silly, somewhat-Pythonesque humor to the film (at one point, the leads must navigate across the perilous &quot;Bog of Eternal Stench&quot;).  I would've given this film 5 stars had it not been for the awful musical interludes.  Now, I am a big fan of Bowie and his music, but it does not belong in this movie.  The numbers aren't particularly well ingratiated as the film was not written to be a musical.  Indeed, Jones reports that he was somewhat aghast when Henson informed him that Bowie would be inserting rock songs into the film.  The songs themselves aren't too bad (though not Bowie's best) but they simply stop the flow of the film dead in it's tracks.  So, savour Terry's charming screenplay, marvel at Henson's artistry, drink in the jaw-dropping beauty of a teenage Jennifer Connelly, and enjoy!
B00005MP58|5.0|What can I say?  Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle capture the lovely characters of Darcy and Elizabeth brilliantly.  The whole ensemble is superb in this retelling of Jane Austen's most famous novel.  <br />I can't urge you enough to purchase this.  It follows the book exceedingly well, with a few additions, but nothing that harms the overall tone of the novel or the characters.<br />I have watched this at least 100 times (I'm not kidding), and each time I find something new that reveals the inner thoughts of the characters, or sheds light on the motivations of Darcy, Elizabeth and the rest of the cast.<br />I think what I like most about this version of P&amp;P is that it follows so closely to the book, and lets the book carry the plot rather than the screenwriter's interpretation of the novel.  So much of Jane Austen is there and it makes for a smashing miniseries!  BUY IT NOW!
B00005QEO2|3.0|because of the b-sides collected, but this is not a great compilation for those who don't have all the Geffen releases ('Done with Mirrors' (1985), 'Permanent Vacation' (1987), 'Pump' (1989), 'Get a Grip' (1993), and 'A Little South of Sanity' (1998)).  From the perspective of a diehard fan, the song choice from 'Permanent Vacation' and 'Pump' is excellent, but the same can not be said of the much underrated 'Done with Mirrors' and the much overrated 'Get a Grip'.  The tracks from the 1998 live record should be viewed in the same context as the record itself - a lackluster fulfillment of the band's contractual obligation to Geffen.<br />The real gems here are the collection of b-sides, of which all but a couple are included here.  Particularly good is the reworking of The Doors' &quot;Love Me Two Times&quot; (from the 'Pump' era).  (NOTE:  I wish Geffen had just put these as bonus cuts on the remastered original records, as has been done with many other bands.)  For this reason alone, I would recommend this record for the serious Aero-fans.  For those just getting started, I recommend purchasing the remastered versions of 'Permanent Vacation' and 'Pump' (which are being released simultaneously).
B00003CXTG|1.0|The Pearl Harbor attack is indeed spectacular (although a bit long) : good special effects, dynamic...<BR>But except for this 15-20 min scene, the movie is quite boring. The love story is just dumb and so predictable : young cute pilots, beautifull nurse, you add a 20 years friendship and a war, and you have the picture. After 5 min. you know how it is going to end (and I'm not talking about the attack)<BR>It is just another so-called &quot;entertaining&quot; movie (and it's not a compliment) except this one is lame. Famous actors and special effects don't make a movie even if it is supposed to be a patriotic one; you need a story, and this one is ridiculous.

B00005Q66T|3.0|If you are a long-time Madonna fan, you really don't need to buy this album.  Unlike The Immaculate Collection, there are no new songs.  Furthermore, it is clear that there was a space limitation on the album, as many of the songs are edited, which takes away some of their charm.  This is particularly true for the songs from the Ray of Light album.  The much-maligned Erotica album is also underrepresented here (where is &quot;Rain&quot;?).<br />It's hard to say bad things about Madonna's music, however.  I'm still a fan, and I'll still buy her music, just maybe not in Greatest Hits form.
B00005OM4N|2.0|1.)  Slave 4 U - Here's a tip for you Brit:  If you wanna be edgy, you need the personality to go with it and you don't.  You're a sweet country girl who calls her mommy five times a day.  And let's face it, you're not singing about dancing with a boy or being a slave to the music, you're talking about being a slave for lust.  So why lie about it?  Stick with something that fits your personality.<BR>2.)  Overprotected - Not too bad.  Tries too hard with the vocals.  And that part hurts my ears.<br />3.)  Lonely - Boring.<BR>4.)  I'm Not a Girl - Great melody.  Some of the lyrics sound good (I'm not a girl/there is no need to protect me.)  But some parts some really bad (...while I'm in between.  Give me a break.)  The lyrics overall were pretty simple.  Nothing exciting.<BR>5.)  Boys - probably one of the best songs on the album.  It has something the other songs lack.  Pizzaz.  (But the whispering in the background is so annoying.)<BR>6.)  Anticipating - Sounds like a song I would lip-sync to while driving to the beach in the summer time with the top down.  Way Groovy.<BR>7.)  I Love Rock 'n' Roll - actually not bad.  It's way better than satisfaction.<BR>8.)  Cinderella - Has passion which is good.<BR>9.)  Let Me Be - should've been replaced a song with better effort.<BR>10.)  Bombastic Love - Not too bad.  Not lyrically spectacular.<BR>11.)  That's where you take me - This song is teetering on the edge of being a good song.  Just not good enough to go all the way.<BR>12.)  What it's like to be me - Probably one of the worst songs I have ever heard.  (sorry Justin)  It lacked everything and had no flow to it.<br />I just don't think the effort went into it that would of made it a great album.  But, it's worth a listen if a friend bought the CD and let you borrow it.
1567302017|5.0|[...] One of the great and moving aspects of this film is that it has NO footage from the Holocaust - no grizzly emaciated faces, no burned or rotting bodies, no marching Nazis, no shooting, no war...only a relentless, spellbinding and enlightening parade of interviews with the victims, perpetrators and spectators of the events: all contemporary to the making of the film.  In this film when we see the camps, we see them as they are NOW; when we meet the pro/antagonists they are (only!) real people in wool and polyester.  The real horror of this film is when you realize that any of these people (good, bad or indifferent) could have been your father, mother, uncle, aunt or cousin.  A truly magnificent work of Art.
B00004YA66|5.0|The premise for this first-rate thriller involves a New York fireman and New York policeman father and son duo who work together to save lives in both the future and the past.  FREQUENCY is based on the idea of shifts in reality occurring in the present as a direct result of communications over short wave radio between a police detective here in this present time (Jim Caviezel) and his father in the past (Dennis Quaid) during times of heightened solar flare activity. <br />This movie works because it is internally consistent, even as it stretches one's concept of what can be possible. I enjoyed watching this movie on several levels, as the father and son get to know each other by talking on a ham radio during a spectacular display of northern lights... and race to stop a killer before he strikes again.<br />I especially enjoyed the way the police detective in the film describes how it feels to have several different memories after reality shifts.  In one scene, John Sullivan (Jim Caviezel) talks with his dad, Frank Sullivan (Dennis Quaid), on a ham radio.  John describes how he recalls both the memories of how his father died in a burning warehouse and also the memories of how his dad rescued a woman and emerged unscathed from that same fire.  John says in amazement, &quot;I remember both... at the same time. It's like waking up from a dream and you're not sure what's real. I remember you being here, but I also remember when you weren't.&quot;<br />This film is especially meaningful for anyone seeking insight into that phenomenon when your keys, purse, or sock aren't where you know you left them.  The bonus features on this DVD are also highly enjoyable and include excellent scientific commentaries on the subject of solar flares, the aurora borealis, and string theory.
B00005LC1H|5.0|In the early 70s, while touring with fellow Pythons, John Cleese (and then wife Connie Booth) stayed at the Gleneagles Hotel in Torquay, Devon, England.  After a day or so, the other Pythons checked out, but Cleese and Booth remained.  The others left for a nearby hotel, disgusted with the abusive behavior of the proprietor, one Major Sinclaire. Cleese -- as one might expect -- was fascinated and entertained by the rude and boorish attitude of Sinclaire.  \\"He was awful.  And just wonderful,\\" Cleese said in a recent interview.<br />When Cleese had an opportunity to create a new show for the BBC, he and Booth developed \\"FAWLTY TOWERS\\" (Warner Bros, ...).  When the pilot was submitted, it was met with resistance by top BBC execs, one of whom wrote a famous memo that said the concept and script was \\"cliched, unfunny and claustrophobic.\\"<br />The premise is essentially about Basil Fawlty, a tightly wound guy who runs a hotel.  And all would be perfect in his world if he didn't have to put up with staff, including his  shrill but competent wife Sybil (Prunella Scales) and guests.<br />In 1975 \\"Fawlty Towers\\" slowly caught the attention of a core audience with only six episodes.  Reruns in the UK and on PBS really caught on.  In 1979 another six episodes aired and were a huge success.  Over time, a hard core audience has steadily grown around the world.  For the first time, all 12 episodes are available, digitally remastered, on a three disc set. An extended, funny and sometimes personal interview with Cleese on each disc is a wonderful primer on his take of why this series works and is more popular than ever. He reflects on the origins of the material and his memories of his stay at the Gleneagles Hotel and the late, infamous, Major Sinclaire; he talks about using taboo subjects that make an audience uneasy and thus more vulnerable to laughter; explains the meticulous attention to the writing process -- each episode on one idea with two and a half weeks on the plot and six weeks for the dialogue; he observes why it's funny when characters like Basil are forced to behave in a way the audience knows is not an honest and authentic feeling of that character at a specific moment of stress.  And he talks about this being a comedy of emotions as opposed to a comedy of ideas (\\"Monty Python and the Holy Grail\\").  There are also interviews with Prunella Scales and Andrew Sachs who plays the hapless Manuel (\\"Que?\\").  Sadly, cowriter and costar Connie Booth is nowhere to be found in the special features.  There's a startling and strangely emotional two minute video tour, with an operatic aria on the sound track, of the burned out Wooburn Grange Country Club that served as the exterior for Fawlty Towers.<br />But best of all are the 12 masterful episodes of outrageous faux pas, crazed desperation, manic dottiness and absurd gyrations.  See again or for the first time \\"A Touch of Class,\\" \\"The Builders,\\"  \\"The Wedding party,\\"  \\"The Germans,\\" \\"The Psychiatrist,\\" The Kipper and the Corpse\\" and the rest.

B00003CX5P|3.0|When I saw this movie when it first came out, I hated it. What a let down. Then I saw the DVD and watched it a couple of times. Once I got past the convaluted story and the Jar Jar Binks stuff I found that I kind of liked the movie. My 2 year old son seems fasinated by the film, so it cant be that bad.
0385505833|1.0|I have high respect for Grisham but the he may want to be just writting legal fiction. I am frustrated as I do not see any story or any point to the whole book. I mean the plot is absurd, ending predictable from the very first page and characters are way too out of reality.<br />Disappionted and I am wondering if I am going to ever get a legal fiction out of Grisham!<br />Thanks
0446677450|4.0|The state of education about the TRUE path to economic success in this country is truly appalling.  Not that this is anything new, it's been that way for decades at least.  But, this book is an excellent first step in breaking through this barrier.  The basic message of the book is, really, extremely simple.  Your money must be made to work FOR you if you ever expect to truly get ahead.  We all need to buy a car, house, etc., but these things (house included) cannot truly be considered assets because they are not bringing any more money into your bank account.  It's necessary to invest your money in ways that will cause it to return a profit to you.  Anything else is essentially flushing money down the toilet.<br />You won't get rich overnight following the lessons in this book.  But, for those of us who are still fairly young and can reasonably expect to have a couple of decades to work on building up our financial resources, the lessons here are invaluable.  My wife and I have both read it, and you can be sure that we will teach these lessons to our own children before they go out there and jump in to the &quot;rat race&quot;.
B00003CXXJ|5.0|Set in a strange, colorful land populated by fairy tale characters, SHREK is a hilarious comedy that will win over audiences of children and adults alike. Shrek (voiced by Mike Myers) is a fearsome green ogre living in isolation in his own cozy little swamp. He is not receptive to visitors, and fends off the occasional party of torch-wielding villagers with ease. But when the power-hungry Lord Farquaad (John Lithgow) turns Shrek's swamp into a relocation camp for dozens of banished fairy-tale characters (including some pesky dwarves, wolves, and fairies) Shrek's quiet, introverted life is ruined. Joined by the talkative Donkey (Eddie Murphy), Shrek makes his way to Farquaad's realm of Duloc, where the Lord promises makes Shrek and offer: He will rid Shrek's land of the unwanted visitors if Shrek will go on a simple quest to free Princess Fiona (Cameron Diaz) from her remote, dragon-guarded castle and convince her to marry Farquaad. On their quest, Shrek and Donkey run into a number of bizarre situations, and Shrek finds himself realizing that he isn't quite the fearsome monster he has always made himself out to be. Reinventing the traditional fairy tale adventure, SHREK features gorgeous computer animation, a unique sense of humor, and compelling characters--especially Eddie Murphy's lovable Donkey.<br />This movie is worth the DVD alone.  The problem only lies in the DVD itself.  Some may find the extras to be lacking.  This is a double disc DVD, so you would expect the 1st disc to have the movie and a few extras and the 2nd disc to have alot of extras, not the case here.  The 1st disc has a widescreen presentation and 2nd has a full screen, but the real problem is they both have the same extras but in differnt places.  I let down nontheless.  Still the documuntry is worth it, but the Karokee Dance Party were the cast sings varouis songs is great.  The donkey singing Sir Mix Alot's &quot;I like Big Butts&quot; is the funniest thing on the DVD.
B00005NC66|4.0|Not exactly a thriller in the purest sense, film critic Jean-Luc Godard's first film \\"A Bout de Souffle\\" or \\"BREATHLESS\\" [...], originally released in 1961, not only ushered in the French New Wave (Nouvelle Vague) movement, but assured the director of a career and made an international star of Jean Paul Belmondo.<br />Seeing this clean, full-frame digital transfer today, one is jolted with the timeless quality of this assured filmed experiment that daringly broke the rules and locked in a new cinematic language, or at least a new dialect.  A hand-held camera more often than not on the move, a black and white documentary feel of realism and natural lighting and locations (not sets), jump cuts, improvisational shots and long, loose, naturalistic conversations (about things other than the so-called plot) between Belmondo and co-star Jean Seberg as amoral lovers on the run.\\"Breathless\\" suffered an anemic remake in 1983 with Richard Gere as a kind of amphetamine-crazed nut case in the Belmondo role.<br />The original title more accurately translates as \\"Out of Breath.\\"  And it is an exhilarating film to re-experience,  In form and theme, this is an existential, anti-film film with numerous, sly film references within the movie frame, in images, props and in the sometimes intentionally \\"big movie music\\" moments to punch up the irony of a scene.  This is a great film.
B00005RFQ5|5.0|The first original 'Prince' album in seven years, 'The Rainbow Children' is also one of the most coherent and complex works from the diminutive Minneapolis genius. <BR>Soundwise, think 70's funk/soul with a very organic and experimental sound. Like Prince's classic albums from the 80's, this one is a stylistic departure, more daring, more personal, drawing on many influences while remaining completely Prince-esque.<BR>Although 'The Rainbow Children' is a concept-album designed as a spiritual manifesto, it can -- and should -- also be enjoyed for its sheer musical power.
B00005OM4N|5.0|I am so glad Britney finally put out an album that shows who she is as a perosn.  The many styles on the CD (R&amp;B, Pop, Rock N Roll, Funk, etc.) show that there are many sides to Britney's personality.  &quot;I'm Not A Girl, Not Yet A Woman&quot; shows off her true singing ability without the help of digitalization and is one of the best songs on the cd. I agree &quot;I'm A Slave 4 U&quot; isn't her best single, but it's another catchy song and is fun to dance to. The only songs on the cd I find annoying even though I am a huge fan of hers are &quot;Anticipating&quot; and &quot;That's Where You Take Me.&quot; These are definite album fillers. On this cd, Britney even wrote 5 of the songs including one of her upcoming singles &quot;Overprotected.&quot; This is an awesome song and will make a great music video.<BR>     Aside from the songs on the album, the enhanced part makes it that much better.  There is a video of Britney performing &quot;Overprotected&quot; which includes clips from her upcoming movie &quot;Crossroads.&quot; Also, there is a pull out poster which is very hot!<BR>     This is truly her best work yet and shows her growth as a perosn and as an artist.
0441172717|4.0|This book has long been acclaimed as a sci-fi masterpiece, and it deserves it.  Frank Herbert has created a rich, full universe, centered on the desert planet Arrakis, also known as Dune.  Arrakis itself is (at least on the surface) a barren, forbidding chunk of rock with extremely forbidding climate.  It would be a worthless, unknown backwater except for one small fact:  It is the only source of the spice Melange, which is required for faster-than-light travel.  Since an interstellar civilization cannot survive without faster-than-light travel, the value of Arrakis becomes obvious.  <br />The central character of the book is the young man Paul Atredies, heir to the dukedom of House Atredies, which has been recently placed in charge of Arrakis by the Galactic Emperor.  His father, the Duke Leto Atredies, smells a trap being laid for him by his enemies but takes the position anyway out of loyalty to his Emperor.  Accompanying him is hs concubine Jessica, who is Paul's mother and a member of the mysterious Bene Gesserit, an ancient order of women with mysterious power.  Plotting against the Atreides are their mortal enemies, the Harkonnens, led by the devious and clever Baron Vladimir Harkonnen and his nephews, Rabban and Feyd-Rautha.  <br />The plot of the book is concerned to a great extent with the ecology of Arrakis.  We learn about the great Sandworms that roam Arrakis' vast deserts, plus the mysterious native Fremen who coexist with the worms.  We also learn about the relationship between the worms and Melange, as well as the Fremen plan to transform Arrakis into a lush paradise.  The Fremen are given a complex society which borrows heavily from Middle Eastern influences.  The complex scheming and plotting between the Harkonnens and the Atreides, not to mention the Emperor and the Guild (the organization of space navigators with a monopoly on space travel), make for complex and interesting reading.<br />The place where, I believe, Dune falls short is in its skimping over action scenes.  There are a few points in the novel where action scenes are very well laid out, mostly small one-on-one duels and such, but there are a number of very large battles, both in the land and on the ground, that are skimmed over very rapidly.  In fact, one of the most pivotal battles in the book is mentioned only by word of mouth.  There is one major exception, though - the rescue of a crew of spice harvesters from the clutches of one of the giant sandworms is an extremely dramatic, well-written moment.  <br />There's also just not a lot of emotion in the book.  The main characters never seem to make any decisions or take any actions from passion or anger.  Everything is done with a cold, icy, methodical calculation.<br />Overall, this is excellent sci-fi, but a very cold book.  Young readers will have a hard time with it.  Also, if you're more interested in action and such, there's little to be found directly.  The book is very slow-moving for the most part.  But, if you like a lot of cloak-and-dagger intrigue and plotting, not to mention heavy doses of mysticism and prophecy, then this is the book for you.
6302794331|5.0|Since first seeing this movie, I have been unable to watch any other version of the story.  It is nearly word for word at times with Dickens' story - yes, I followed along!  There is a lot of humor and fun in this movie, but also some touching scenes.  I even cried at one point!<br />I can watch this movie all year round and it is always wonderful.  It never gets old and starts the holiday season off on the right foot!
B000002GYG|4.0|Face it.  Tom Waites has skills...  and the studio that produced this had skills too.  So skillful was the studio that you ACTUALLY believe you are listening to Tom work a real crowd in a real bar with everything happening perfectly... mood, ambience all that stuff. But you're not.<br />I like the poetry, his trio is top shelf.  Okay and I guess you really can pretend he's actually in a bar doing a live recording.  But he's not.<br />I like live stuff, this was manufactured.  Kind of like a theater in sound.  Which it is
B00003CXZ4|5.0|As far as I concerned. At first, after reading about how the story goes in reverse chronological order I wasn't sure I'd like it, and believe me I'm no intellectual geek. However, I watched it as something different, unique, and because of that approach I was able to see why this movie has gotten the raves it has. It IS refreshing. The plot of a man who can't make new memories but is looking for his wife's killer may sound gimmicky but it worked in this movie. That's because the acting was so good, and the way the screenplay was written made the story easy to follow. All in all, I was pleasantly surprised by how excellent this movie is, I would recommend it.
B00005R87Q|5.0|It's rare to find a movie that you want to see more than once.. and I saw it 3 times in the theatre.  Needless to say that this movie isn't one that you get bored with easily or hope it ends soon.  All of the characters are very well developed, there's a good plot, the acting is good, and the cars are awesome.  Everyone should give this movie at least one viewing :)
B00003CXFG|4.0|I just had to get that out of my system.  This man is just too cute.<br />That said, I have to tell you that &quot;Pitch Black&quot; is a welcome surprise.  In a sea of mindless rehashes of classic SF vehicles, it's got some heft.  And all gushing about Diesel aside, I have to say that he's a big part of why this film works.  He and Radha Mitchell carry a good deal of the film's weight with something more than just simple competence.<br />The story itself is one we've seen dozens of times: a group of mismatched and often difficult characters are thrown together in a hostile environment, and try to keep themselves and each other alive.  Instead of a single alien/predator/monster, PB gives us flocks of them, all pretty scary.  And instead of a quirky-but-basically-good lead, we have Riddick who is something of a monster himself.<br />There are plot holes in this film big enough to pilot a drop ship through, but ignore that and concentrate on the plot twists, the fairly deft characterization and the look of the thing.  It has style, and it's a lot of fun if you'll just let it play out.  Absolutely worth your time if you're a fan of the genre.  And if you're not, if you just want a little eye candy, Diesel and Mitchell are both excellent choices.
B00005R2M3|4.0|I liked this album.  Buy it!  How's that for a brief review?  No - I thought I'd review Shakira's English-language debut by critiquing all the songs on the album.  So here goes:<br />1.  Objection (Tango) is an excellent uptempo track that will do well on radio and will attract more fans than Whenever, Wherever.  Fun lyrics here too!!!!  A+<br />2.  Underneath Your Clothes - a Shakira ballad.  If you've heard the Spanish her ballads are much more better.  But a fair track nonetheless.  C+<br />3.  Whenever, Wherever - great English debut and is gaining a lot of U.S. fans.  A-<br />4.  Rules - Can you say the 80s?  That ahh ahh lyric reminds of the Big 80s and it will remind u too!  B-<br />5.  The One - I thought a Glen Ballard pairing with Shakira would sound more Alanis-esque and not be a ballad.  I don't care for this one at all.  Most likely a personal track based on her new found love - her fiance.  C-<br />6.  Read For The Good Times - Another very 80s-ish track but I like it better than Rules especially the Oh Oh Oh Oh lyrics.  I can dance to this too!!!  B+<br />7.  Fool - I find myself singing the ahh ahh ahh fool part over and over again .  A great track.  Arguably the best English track on the album.<br />8.  Te Dejo Madrid - a track truly worthy of Shakira.  Her Spanish singing is so much more appealing and she sings with more emotion and conviction here.  There is a passsion here missing in her English tracks.  Great uptempo song.  A<br />9.  Poem to a Horse - this is Shakira being very bitter.  A lyrical song that relies on meaning more than music.  It's a tad different from the rest here.  B<br />10.  Que Me Quedes Tu - an ok Spanish track.  Not much to say about it except very average.  I don't like Shakira ballads!! B-<br />11.  Eyes Like Yours - arguably the worst track on the album simply because it tries to win over English speaking fans when the original Ojos Asi does a better job at that!!!  Gloria Estefan's (who I love) lyrics are bad!  Another Spanish track should have been substituted.  D<br />12.  Suerte - same vibe as Whenver, Wherever and arguably better but I love those English lyrics.....&quot;Lucky that my breasts are small and humble so you don't confuse them with mountains&quot;  A-<br />13.  Te Aviso, Te Anuncio - as good as Objection but sung with more energy and passion.  I love them both equally because I like the Enlish lyrics (I love you for free and I'm not your mother).  But if you like the Spanish more than the English, I wouldn't blame you!  A+<br />All in all - a good album but not as good as her previous one Donde Estan Los Ladrones because that had a rock edge to it that this one is missing.  It's too soft in spots.  Like I said...a little too much fabric softener in this laundry service!!!r Spanish track should have been substituted.  D<br />12.

B00003CXXJ|4.0|Do the short jokes short circuit the story?<br />First of all, let me say this. This film is brilliant in many many ways. The casting of the characters, the small details. Cameron Diaz was outstanding as Fiona, Eddie murphy's voice and personality perfect for the donkey. Even Mike Myers was OK. Lithgow's snarl was spot on for the prince. Heck, the funniest scene dead to rights is the first one in which you see Farquad as he interrogates the gingerbread man. The absolutely spot-on spoofs of many Disney and fairy tale standards. The scene with robin hood simultaneously taking a swipe at Robin hood, Crouching Tiger, Jackie Chan, and the Matrix.... lord I fell over on that one. Or the wedding scene's little pokes at the Princess Bride..<br />I loved it. I've bought it. I still love it. In comparison to Monsters Inc. This is Calvin and hobbes to The Far Side. Both wonderfully skewed takes on accepted reality, with the far side specializing in applying the mundane to the absolutely wierd, and C&H taking the mundane and transforming oit through a very childlike vivid sense of fantasy.<br />But....<br />First of all, for some this is not really a kids movie. A teen movie, yes, one I've evenlet my nine year old see, yes, but not really for kids. The innuendo doesn't bug me, but the opening which went out of it's way to be disgusting in a garbage-pail kids way, and the ear-wax candle were just a bit much.<BR> <BR>While we're on the opening, I know that this is a spoof of fairy tales, but did we have to have the cheesball pop music? No, nothing against pop (actually I thought having smashmouth cover I'm  believer was brilliant and fit wonderfully into the film) but c'mon, can't ya find something more fitting than All Star?<br />on a minor gripe, I think they shoulda used the original Lenoard Cohen track instead of the cover when Fona was getting ready for the wedding. his voice fits better.<br />Some people have complained about the short jokes. OK.....  this may or may not contravene the ipoint of the film, but what people are missing is that both Fiona and Farquad were looking for a way to overcome their physical \\"handicaps.\\" Fiona had her head no less full of (...) over that than Farquad at the beginning of the movie. And most of the jokes about Farquad, especially the compensation one, were brought upon himself by his own BEHAVIOR rather than his lack of stature.<br />Nevertheless, just because Farquad was a jerk doesn't entirely excuse it.<br />What ticked me off more was that Fiona \\"Ugly\\" wasn't. A little overweight? Yes. Obese? No. Ugly? No, actually rather cute. She should have looked more ogre-like, not just chubby and green.<br />The only other thing that got me was the spell unwinding. i can buy that they had to make it more obvious than the transformation sequences, but it smacked so much of \\"lookit the kool things we can do\\" rather than a logical progression of the other shown spell effects.<br />My two cents.
6302636779|4.0|Here it is so open your eyes and pay attention: This movie is Money. Slow money like the kind you get for selling lemonade on the corner for 5 cents. Slow like Flo Jo runs in a marathon. I sugjest you drink a lot when you watch this movie. I did one time and it really braught it all together. like two storms that come together somewhere in middle america and causes a tornado all up in yah. Yeah this movie is hard to get into for sure. like getting into watching cricket on tv. I like the part when she's in the jungle, it really gives you a feel of what it must be like. Just like I did with your girlfriend last night. I think it's worth seeing at least once. Like it's worth seeing cry of the white wolf once. If your a hepburn fan like me than this movie should interest you. If not, than I wouldn't bother.
B00005QZWI|5.0|The musical variety in Shore's score is appropriate, and its strength riveting. It is full of tension-building themes, many accomplished using chorus, with lighthearted moments captured in pennywhistle and fiddle. The percussion is remarkable, and strange elements are introduced to keep the listener off-guard.<br />I only hope the movie delivers as well.
B00005QY5Y|1.0|This lame careerist yuppie rock must have uncle tupelo rolling in his grave. Each track is an ingenuine nugget wrapped in some  twangy schitck about being a hip gen-Xer livin in the 90s. And that sh--y song thats getting played on the t.v. is not only a shameless marketing ploy to cash in on tragedy, but also a direct rip from that &quot;Life is a highway I wanna ride it all night long.&quot; song. I'd like to see Jeff Tweedy take Adams'&quot;weathered&quot; guitar and smash it.
1573225517|4.0|Its taken me a while to get around to reading this one, but I am glad I finally did. In a literary world full of Bridget Jones and her ilk its nice to see the flip side of the coin. While no where near as funny to me as the books with Brittish female singletons as the central characters this was a very entertaining read. I enjoyed the song references very much and many of them brought back some memories from my own past. What I liked best of all was that in a sexually reversed role from what we normally see, Rob was raised out of his stagnation by Laura, his girlfriend, instead of Laura waiting for Rob to rescue her. Now I am off to watch the movie based on this book and see how they compare.
6300215814|4.0|Breakfast at Tiffany's<br />From the opening shot of Audrey Hepburn as the enchanting pixilated Holly Golightly, elegantly dressed in simple black gown and pearls with hair swept wispily off her neck, delicately devouring a danish while gazing longingly into the glittering windows of Tiffany's, I wanted to be her.  However, as the film unfolds, a much different Holly Golightly is revealed, one who appears playful and resilient on the outside but who suffers from crushing bouts of the \\"mean reds\\", a fear of lonliness and disconnection which only a \\"breakfast at Tiffany's\\" can cure.  Holly has landed by way of Hollywood in New York City to reinvent herself and survives on the $50 per powder room donations of the shallow sex crazed men that desire her and whom she often ends up ditching.  She throws wild parties, wears lots of perfect little black dresses and unbelievable hats, looks stunning with mere hours of sleep, visits an incarcerated mafioso named Sally  Tomato to exchange weather reports, earning a neat hundred for her efforts, and crawls through windows and into bed with her new neighbor who tenderly reminds her of her brother Fred and whom she calls Fred.  She is, at once, a bon vivant, charming and flighty, resourceful and manipulative, vulnerable and lonely, captivating and clever, wise and naive, anxious and frightened.  We are simultaneously attracted to and rooting for her, beside her during her mischievous Halloween mask shoplifting spree in the five and ten with \\"Fred\\"  in love with her guilefulness; heartbroken and sympathetic when she receives word that her  brother Fred has been killed in action; and yet disappointed with her callousness when she sends Doc back home, alone, and her insensitivity when she thoughtlessly abandons \\"cat\\" in the rain, never believing that they belonged together, not realizing that she had actually found a place to call home, the place she has always been searching for.   The original 1958 story was rewritten to make the screenplay more palatable for 1960's audiences.   Lost are the homosexual undertones (it is suspected that Paul Varjak is gay in the novella and there are hints of Holly`s bisexuality in it as well) of Capote's work as well as the \\"true to the spirit and occasional vulgar mouth of `Miss Holly Golightly, Traveling`,\\" ending in which she disappears without a trace.   In the Hollywood happy ending version, the wild thing Holly is finally captured by Paul's charms. The final shot of the lovebirds kissing passionately in the pouring rain with \\"cat\\" returned safely to Miss Golightly's arms remains the essence of the true and reliable Hollywood romance.

B00003CX5P|4.0|This movie has perhaps been reviewed more than any other movie in history and the expectations were higher than ever, so let's see if anything can be added to what has been said already.<br />1. The dvd:<br />The dvd is brilliant. Never before has the extra material on a dvd been so extensive. The menu's are beautiful, the deleted scenes are great (special effects added esspecially for the dvd), and the documentaries give a very good insight into how the movie was made without getting dull.<br />2. The story:<br />Compared to the classic movies the story seems a bit thin. The main story (the battle between the Naboo aided by the Jedi vs the Federation aided by the Sith) serves only as a means to show the state of the Star Wars galaxy at this point in time. A galaxy where the Galactic senate has lost control over it's people and a galaxy where a business organisation (the Federation) can hold a planet hostage over tax disputes without any resistance of the government. The greatest weakness of the story of this first film is that you probably need to see the next two movies to appreciate it's main point, namely that the real bad guy Senator Palpatine aka Darth Sidious uses the confusion he has caused to let himself be appointed Supreme Chancellor of the galaxy. So the bad guys really win at the end of this movie and this is not clear to most viewers when the movie is finished. <br />3. The Characters:<br />Qui-gon Jinn: Good strong character, the most important person in this movie as it is he who set's the wheels in motion that begin Anakin's life as a Jedi.<br />Obi-wan Kenobi: Good character although a bit stiff. Shows a certain wisdom beyond his age.<br />Anakin Skywalker: Irritating know-it-all. Not nearly as wonderful as everybody thinks he is. &quot;I can fix anything&quot;, right!<br />Queen Amidala/Padme: Stiff as the queen, somewhat more interesting as Padme. Some parallel's to Leia in A New Hope.<br />Jar Jar Binks: Overtly present. Sometimes funny, sometimes not at all, but not nearly as annoying as most people say if you don't pay to much attention to him (which is kinda difficult at times).<br />Which brings me to the movies High's and Low's:<br />High's: Podrace (the most important action sequence in the movie)<BR>The political scheming (if you understand the meaning of it all to the larger story). Overall special effects are stunning.<br />Low's: Story not clear enough, Jar Jar (at times), Bad guys don't have enough screen time (Darth Maul is great!).
0316286850|5.0|This book is the zenith of the arts of both makeup and photography.  Kevyn is THE genius of his field.  His work and his writing are the essence of using the outside to help comfort and beautify the inside, yes honey, a great face DOES make you feel beautiful inside just like holding a puppy dog when he/she gives you that big wet puppy kiss.  I am male, Karra A. von Romanov is my female gender and Kevyn's work was part of the inspiration for the name.  I am so deeply indebted to him for sharing his genius and his insights that I wanted my female half to have the initials K.A.  Karra is the name of the first girl I kissed and Annastasia von Romanov is a tribute to the true elegance and taste of a bygone time.  True elegance and taste are a perfect match for Kevyn Aucoin.  This book is somuch more than a book of exterior beauty and it is an extremely uplifting read.  Thank you Kevyn for sharing your work and your thoughts with us and thank the publisher for bringing it to us. Also, this is NOT a book in which to skip the forward, Gena Rowlands hits the mark with her very insightful commentary.<BR>Sincerely, Karra A. von Romanov
B00005Q45W|4.0|I love LC and have all his music (I think) and have spent much of my life waiting for the next installment. At first listening some disappointment, I'd expected too much. It sounded good but not as good as I had expected. then I listened closer, as one has to do....and it was there all the time. The phrasing, words, meaning, symbolism. If each track were rated up to 5 stars I would give 4 tracks a 3 star rating, 3 tracks a 4 star rating, and 2 tracks a 5 star rating. &quot;Love Itself&quot; gets 6 stars and, for me, is not only one of his best renditions ever, but alone worth the price of this cd.
B00005QHPQ|5.0|I am a Enrique fan and this CD was fabulous.  I loved how it is different from his last CD.  Yes it has two ballads but it is a lot more up tempo than the last one.  Making it hard for me to not push 'repeat all' on the CD player.  Plus, I love the spanish versions of the three songs they are more seductive and sensual.
B00005J4HH|5.0|New to the band, and oh my god!  Think Jeff Buckley mixed with Radiohead and add a dash of Queen even.  Hard to believe that these guys are so young, (22 I believe) they sound so refined.  These guys know exactly where they're going.  The sounds sweep around you, the lyrics are soemtimes harsh, but always witty, and the general feel they leave will make your heads bob and your toes tap.  I just can't wait to see these guys live!!
B00003CXZ4|5.0|This movie will make you work, but that's not a bad thing. Hollywood has catered to laziness for too long, and it was past time that someone gave us a movie that we actually had to think to enjoy! &quot;Memento&quot; does that and rewards efforts with the most mind blowing experience I've had in a while. That part of my brain that I use to watch movies had become stagnant because every movie I've seen seems to follow the same story line and have a predictable ending. Nothing prepared me for the truth about the focus of this movie, &quot;Leonard Shelby&quot; that was revealed at the ending. Like &quot;Leonard&quot;, the man in this movie who can't make new memories, I was clueless as to what happened before each scene, so I felt the same frenzied &quot;what is going on??&quot; that Leonard Shelby feels as he tries to find the man who raped his wife and left her to die, and also damaged his brain in the process. Like Leonard, I had to concentrate on details and clues that I normally wouldn't even notice in most movies. It was very exhilarating to do so. Guy Pearce did a wonderful job as Leonard Shelby, and Joe Pantoliano and Carrie-Anne Moss are great too. I recommend this movie wholeheartedly.
B00005QZWJ|5.0|Wow, is this thing out already?  That means it's only a month until the movie comes out.  If you haven't been hearing the hype about this movie, you must be living in a cave.  You can mark my words here, this will be the biggest trilogy of all time, not to mention biggest movie.<br />Anyways, on to the review.<br />I am an avid music soundtrack fan.  My favorite composers include James Horner, Alan Silvestri, Elliot Goldenthal, David Arnold, Randy Edelman, and Hanz Zimmer.  I had never heard of Howard Shore before, except for his work in &quot;The Game&quot;, starring Michael Douglas.  I thought his music was brilliant in that movie.  It fit the theme perfectly: mysterious and suspenseful, yet intriguing.<br />Since I am a huge Lord of the Rings fan, I had to get my hands on the soundtrack for this movie.  I have been searching the Internet for anything that will allow me to listen to this soundtrack before it came out.  I got a few samples here and there.  Even by 30-second samples I was amazed at how he brings the emotion of the story up and down with his music.<br />I finally bought this soundtrack, today, when it came out.  I cannot comprehend what I hear.  This soundtrack makes me melt into my couch for hours, just listening at every detail, every note.  Every time I listen to it, I find something new that I didn't hear before.  I really can't even put into words how good this soundtrack is.  <br />He uses each element of classical/choral music to bring you into the story.  In fact I can almost see him telling a story through his music.  I am whisked away to Hobbiton in &quot;Concerning the Hobbits&quot;.  I feel like a Black Rider in &quot;The Black Rider&quot; is chasing me.  In &quot;Many Meetings&quot;, I almost believe that I am sitting in the circle at the Meeting in Rivendale.  During &quot;The Bridge Of Khazad Dum&quot; I am battling the Cave Troll and Orcs.  And at &quot;The Breaking of the Fellowship&quot;, I feel like I've lost a best friend.<br />Although I am not a classical musician myself, I can tell that Howard Shore put so much time into this, and he deserves the credit for a great soundtrack to a great movie.<br />If you even think about not buying this album and you like the movie, it's a sin.<br />BUY THIS NOW!
B00003CX5P|1.0|What this guy did to his own Star Wars excellent saga is criminal. The dialogues... the acting... the plot -what plot?-,  the characters -maybe except Ewan McGregors Obi Wan- ... and... JAR JAR!!! <BR> George Lucas had not directed a movie for twenty years till he made this one, and it shows.
0446677450|1.0|This is one of the stranger books I've read.  It seems to be a fictionalized account of author's childhood.  Yet, for some reason, it is classified book on finance.<BR>So, here is my review of several of books points:<BR>1) This is a book of fiction.  While the author is indeed the son of well-respected Hawaiian eduactor and politician Ralph Kiyosaki, the other \\"rich\\" dad is understood to be fictitious character.  No such person ever believed to exist.<BR>2) If you want to read the books on boy's adventures, Mark Twain has much better series involving Tom Sawyer and his friends.  I highly recommend Mark Twain.<BR>3) Any financial advice in this book is ridiculous. (...).  What is more, upon closer examination, it seems to be (copied) from the other book, Millionaire Next Door, which points are exaggerated here to grotesque.  This observation makes sense because, in fact, Mr. Kiyosaki was not rich at all before publishing his book.  The only wealth he has, seemed to be derived from sales of this and other books and numerous supplemental materials.  So, if you want correct advice, read Millionaire Next Door.  It has its own pitfalls, but seems solid otherwise.  But Mr. Kiyosaki's came after not long after the other one.<br />Bottom line: why would you get financial advice from a person who never made much, and can not really communicate well whatever little he knows?
B00003CXA2|2.0|Europeans know how to appreciate good films way better than US industry, so it is no surprise that Pulp Fiction won at the Cannes Festival, and Forrest Gump won the Oscar. Dont get me wrong, Forrest is a good film, but Pulp Fiction is one of those films that mark a generation, but it was too &quot;edgy&quot; for the Academy.<BR> Forrest Gump is not a great movie.

6305546789|4.0|The film that not only put John Carpenter on the map and instantaneously declared actress Jamie Lee Curtis as a superstar in her first roll as the resourceful babysitter who is chased by the killer on Halloween night, but also opened new doors for the viable and successful genre, Halloween, despite it being released over twenty-years-ago, remains to be a cult favorite that'll-in addition to its brothers-still be swiped off shelves during the month of October, as it remains to be the standard to which all other modern horror films are measured. There is just something about it that entices me to see it on every Halloween night. Perhaps because the presence of the all-most powerful and pitiless Michael Myers, who, as we know, neither feels pain nor has any compassion amongst others whatsoever; he even shows that he has great fondness for death, as he tilts his head sideways and watches his victims' time decomposing virtually each time he's done with them. (As Dr. Loomis said, this killer truly is nothing but pure evil, and it now is clear to us that he meant that literally!) And perhaps because of the film's spooky music that has yet been played in every other sequel that followed? Or, simply, perhaps because it takes place in Halloween? All I know is that Halloween night just wouldn't be the same without it, regardless of how many times it's been watched and how predictable it has now become. It's like when you play a really great video game that you have beaten several times and yet continue to play-you know where all of the villains are hiding, but continue to play it for the sheer pleasure of blowing their brains away.<br />Produced for very little amount of money and a tight shooting schedule, Carpenter and longtime producer Debra Hill-who too was put on the map-must have had no idea of just how big of a hit they were going to have on their hands here, but once it was released, the results were staggering.<br />Halloween is possibly the most influential and successful independent film ever to be made. It's an all-time classic that not only declared these fine people as worthy filmmakers but also introduced what has now become one of the world's most eminent psychotic killers of all time. We see Michael Myers lurking in the shadows and gradually revealing his ghostly appearance behind those frightened ones who'll without a doubt fall as another victim to his violent disorder if do not get a move on, or we see him pretending to have been conquered by his opponents, only to get right back up again for some more heart-pounding suspense, and we love it. We can't get enough of it, and that's because Halloween has the quality many other horror films lack in.ssful independent film ever to be made.

0880794968|5.0|I've read for nearly 30 years and I've never liked the original Rider Waite deck. To me reading them was like trying to absorb road directions from an incoherent person who was hitting you over the head with a board -- the information got lost in the unpleasantness of the experience. I did not like the way the figures were outlined in black, the colours looked too primary and unrealistic and I found the human figures devoid of personality.<br />I find the Universal Waite deck truly beautiful. The colours are softer and more natural; the outlines are gone or considerably toned down, giving the deck a more human feel. The characters actually have expressions. For the first time I have been able to look at the cards to notice certain details, like the fact that the chained woman in The Devil has a bunch of grapes for a tail, or that the Magician is wearing a snake for a belt. Reading with this deck is a pleasure; the cards really let you in.<br />I've heard a number of people complain that Hanson-Roberts changed details in the original deck and that that ruined it for them. I guess I see it more as, Hanson-Roberts' focus was different and it's a focus I prefer. I think she did a service to a deck that (in my experience) was becoming far less popular with new readers, due to the amazing number and variety of decks that are now available.<br />If the original Rider Waite deck works for you, you will probably have some difficulties with the Universal Waite. If it doesn't, but you would like to add a more traditional deck to your toolkit, the Universal Waite may be the deck you're looking for.
B00003CXXI|1.0|It is a pity that the minimum number of stars I can give is 1, because I don't think this Shrek movie deserves any. It is an insult to all the genuine 1-star movies out there.<br />Is it a sign of the times that a woeful excuse for entertainment such as this travesty is so popular? Where is the discernment in today's movie-going public? There are fantastic animated movies (Toy Story 1 &amp; 2, A Bug's Life) and there are fantastic children's movies (A Princess Bride) and then there is this.<br />Shallow humour that relies almost solely on flatulence, the most confused moral/message EVER seen in a movie, a plot that is so predictable as to induce a coma in an insomniac, and an inane script all add up to one of the worst movies ever made.<br />If you laughed at this movie, if you overlooked the messages (fat girls are hideous and unloveable, slender girls are beautiful, lovely, sweet and normal, short guys are evil and deserve death because of it, hairy guys are ugly, short hairy guys are fair game for bullying) just because &quot;it's funny&quot;, then you need to take a good long hard look at yourself and your values.<br />If you agreed with what you thought the message was (beauty comes from within, or something like that), then how do you reconcile the conflicting messages from the rest of the movie? It is a sign that the creative team behind this movie had no idea how to tell a story, they just wanted a few cheap laughs and a showcase for their animation skills.<br />Save your money. Read a book. Take a class in drawing and learn how to look at people. You'll see the beauty in people, even if they are 'round', or 'short', or even 'hairy'.
B00005OWEG|3.0|Once again, a sub-standard DVD edition of a well-made Paramount movie.  Apparently the only movies Paramount cares about are &quot;Forrest Gump&quot; and &quot;Star Trek: The Motion Picture.&quot;  If *I* was producing this DVD, I would make it a 2-disc set, with the features being a new Audio Commentary by Francis Ford Coppola, an Audio Commentary by Martin Sheen and Robert Duvall, and on the second disc, the Documentary &quot;Hearts of Darkness,&quot; recounting the making of the film.  We should come to expect nothing less these days.
0061040967|2.0|Bare in mind that most folks reviewing this book are die-hard Pratchett fanatics, the types who will pay a lot of money for a 167 page coffee-table  book.  If you witlessly love anything Discworldian then you do not need reviews; you will adore this book. If you like, rather than worship, the excellent writing that Terry Pratchett is capable of then you will be seriously disappointed with The Last Hero.  This is the sort of substandard (compared to the usually high standards of Discworld novels) work that inspires conspiracy theories. Perhaps the pod-people have taken over Pratchett's body and are trying to pass as him. Or an obsessive fan has written a Discworld book and palmed it off as the real thing. Terry Pratchett is indeed one of the best satirists  currently in print; it is a shame that he now seems to be writing fake versions of his oun style.
B00005RFQ5|1.0|The tip-off should've been the \\"controversial new album\\" sticker on the cover. Instinctively, I equated controversial with problematic. But being a once devoted  fan, I bought it anyway. I should've paid attention to my instincts. \\"The Rainbow Children\\" is Prince formerly known as artist's attempt at a smooth jazz and soul record. Problem is, it's long on slick, soulless production and religious claptrap and exceedingly short on interesting ideas and melodies. To employ one of Prince's own tired conceits, eye believe this 1 is 4 the dumper.
B00000ILE6|5.0|I didn't like the first movie all that much because I thought it was drawn out, .... boring really.  Yet this movie laid the first one  to waste.  Had to be dragged kicking and screaming to go see it ... cause I loathed the first one so much, but was pleasantly surprised.  EVERYONE is a great actress or actor.  No second rate performances on this one. Even &quot;the kid&quot; is a great actress.  Only thing bad to say about it ... the special effects are lacking somewhat.  But who cares? In Aliens3 and Resurrection, the special effects are better but the script isn't anywhere near as entertaining.  &quot;Game over.&quot;  &quot;Why don't you put her in charge.&quot;  &quot;Maybe you haven't been paying attention to current events......'  Paxton has some great one liners.<br />By the way I thought Resurrection[4] was giving this a run for its money 'til they went diving into the cooling tanks. I thought it unraveled quickly after that.  Almost as if there are two movies in Resurrection; the first half, stunning, funny, flawless; the second half....  spare me please.
B00005QZWI|4.0|Being a huge Enya fan as well as fan of Howard Shore, I just had to acquire the soundtrack to the much anticipated &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;. It was well worth the wait. Enya did not disappoint me with her two contributions to this soundtrack, I particularly dug the last track &quot;May It Be&quot;. Howard Shore's work on the score itself is nothing short of compelling and breathtaking. In some strange ways, Howard Shore's score vaguely reminds me of John Williams' work with the Star Wars films including &quot;The Phantom Menace&quot; but mostly the music has a Wagner quality to the sound with the sonic impact the music has. It can sometimes be loud and sometimes quiet. The listener can hear the intensity as the music moves from being loud to being quiet. Although it took me a couple of listens to allow the music sink into me, I thoroughly enjoyed Howard Shore's film score as well as Enya's tracks she contributed to the soundtrack.
B00005RFAI|5.0|This CD is not what I would have expected from Pink, as she has almost completely left her signature hip-hop R&amp;B style to a sound that is generally much slower and almost rock at times.  She hasn't completely left her R&amp;B sound however especially in the later songs which are almost gospel sounding in the same respect as Alicia Keys.  I'm actually quite surprised I haven't found any other reviews that have compared this to Alicia's &quot;Songs In A Minor&quot; - as both use the same old-blues-with-modern-update sound.  Pink also opens up more about her feelings of sadness and inadequacy as apposed to the straight-out anger and Destiny's Child style guy bashing she displays throughout &quot;Can't Take Me Home&quot;.  I would recommend this CD to fans of Pink's first CD - especially people who enjoyed her enjoyed Pink's slower songs such as &quot;Private Show&quot; as this CD is generally an evolution of those.  But most music fans will enjoy this CD as it is one of the best I have ever listened to and it appeals to lots of different kinds of people.  Even my Slipknot-obsessed friend Stephanie asked to borrow this CD from me because she liked it so much.
1587990717|5.0|This is an extremely insightful and entertaining book. And wise. My mother always told me it was far better to be lucky than smart--as a matter of fact, whenever I got good grades, she'd always say, Lots of luck! And good traders make money, period. A bit arrogant, but so is harsh love, this book being one of the intellectual variety. Nassim Taleb will always inform, expose, ridicule, and above all, enlighten. This is a must read for thoughtful traders and trading room managers--and their wives.
B00005IC2H|4.0|Spacey, dreamy, and emotional music. About the closest thing to classical in popular music today, and its just about as gorgeous as a Mozart or Beethoven. Etheral melodies and sweeping crescendos create an atmosphere you wont want to leave. The Icelandic lyrics are perfect for this music, it spills out like alien poetry - grab a pair of headphones and dig in to this.
B00005Q66T|5.0|Madonna proves once again that she is indeed the most musically talented artist alive! Her new GHV2 album is amazing! There is not one let down here. From beautful ballads like &quot;Take A Bow&quot;(a #1 Hit for 7 weeks in the U.S.)to hot dance tracks like &quot;Deeper And Deeper&quot; Madonna's range shines bright. If you care even one iota about Pop Culture you must own this album!
B00003CXZ4|5.0|First off, this is probably the best movie I have seen in years. This movie will pull you in from the start, mystify you for 113 minutes, and will leave you stunned at the end. This is not your typical revenge movie, because both the story and the storytelling are very original. The reason being that this story is told backwards. You watch the scenes of the film in their reverse chronological order, which leaves you wondering not &quot;what happens next,&quot; but rather &quot;what just happened?&quot;<br />Leonard (Pearce) is on a personal mission to discover the identity of the man who murdered his wife. But to complicate matters, Leonard has a rare memory condition which he recieved the night his wife was killed. He no longer has any short-term memory. He can rememeber who he is, and everything that happened before his memory condition started, but he can't form new memories. He relies on notes and photographs to continually remind himslef what he is doing, who his friends are, and where he has been. <br />The story is told in reverse order so the viewer can sympathize with his condition. Leonard doesn't know where he just was, or what he just did; so this way the viewer doesn't know either. The suspenseful drama that unfolds is like no other you have ever seen. It is a unique story in that you know how it ends, but you watch to find out how it began. With every passing scene you go a little further back in Leonard's life, learning what he no longer remembers, until you finally reach a shocking finale (beginning?) that will make you want to watch it again on the spot. <br />This is one of those movies about which you will discover something new each time you watch. The discussions you will have with your friends after seeing it will never get boring. I watched this movie 4 times during the first week that I owned it, and then let someone borrow it. Every day, I called that person almost begging him to return it so I could watch it again. There isn't much on the DVD by way of extras, but ragardless I highly recommend that you BUY (not rent) this movie. It leaves a very lasting impression. Unlike Leonard, once you've seen this movie, you will never forget it.

B00002E23E|2.0|If this wasn't the only concert film available of Led Zeppelin it wouldn't be such a tragedy.. but it is.<br />This is a second rate concert at best. At the time it was released Plant himself acknowledged its shortcomings, saying it simply had to be released, regardless of the calibre of the music. His words were to the effect that it 'certainly wasn't magical'. And it isn't.<br />For those of us lucky enough to have heard/seen a magical performance of Led Zeppelin in their prime, this concert representation is a pathetic farce. It doesn't even scratch the surface of the brilliance of the band. <br />On top of the mediocre performance, the editing is simply brutal. The 'dream' sequences spliced in and out of the concert footage are rather silly and beside the point, and even the live footage is so butchered that the sound/images don't match half the time. <br />As for the 'dream' sequences themselves.... the fact that the makers of this film are trying to 'liven up' a Led Zeppelin concert should be your first clue that something is wrong.<br />It's not that this film is so bad that bothers me, it's not terrible... it's just mediocre. BUT THAT'S THE PROBLEM! Led Zeppelin was one of the best rock bands of all time.. anyone watching this who had never seen a 'magical' concert would scratch their heads and wonder what all the fuss was about.<br />Let's pray that somewhere, sometime, someone digs up some magic from the video vaults and shows the kind of mind-blowing concert that these guys were capable of.

For those of you who were there you'll swear you recognize the faces of people you know you've never met. For those born too late.. you'll swear this was all made up, no one could be that weird!<br />The music is priceless. Santana, Jimi Hendrix, The Who, Joe Cocker, Sly and the Family Stone, Ten Years After all give unforgettable performances. Lesser lights shine in their own fashion, from the sublime to the ridiculous, and there's plenty of both!<br />The documentary portions are lengthy and numerous... so be prepared to sit through a lot of STUFF. (DVD's are nice that way, you can skip ahead through the STUFF if you're not in the mood)<br />It's a time capsule that's not to be missed. It's a must have for any music fan who owns a DVD player. My favorite music DVD, no other can match the 'peak' performances captured here.
B000002MY3|5.0|A few months ago I had never really heard mush of Alanis, except for 'Head Over Feet,''Ironic,' and I danced the Rumba to 'Thank U.' The songs were okay, but when asked to speak of great music artist, she was not even in my top twenty.  Then my friend Ali gave me 'Jagged Little Pill' as a gift.  I have never been so surprised by an album, nor have listened to it as much in so short a time.  The power of her lyrics and the variety of beats seem to speak right to a person, and aren't at all superficial.  <br />'Perfect,' my all-time favorite, is heart-wrenching the the fact that it is true in so many places, but is then followed by 'Hand in My Pocket,' showing that though seh will go through things it doesn't seem she can handle, she can come out on top. 'Forgiven' is a torn and tattered ballad that seems to sear you within with it's pathetic cries, and 'Mary Jane' will be one that thousands of people can understand, either in 1st or 3rd person.<br />Her sassy and angry music are great at times, and show that she isn't all whiny ballads and 'hurting,' that she can kick someone's butt if need be.  But the one that shows the most soul is the hidden track at the end, which she does acapella. If you want to know Morisette, listen to that.
0446608955|4.0|One of the previous reviewers called this a &quot;chick book&quot;. I would have to agree - and I am a &quot;chick&quot;! I wouldn't recommend this book to a guy (hate to say it, but true). I also wouldn't expect To Kill a Mockingbird...<br />The book is a quick read (I read it in about 6 hours). The reading is easy, somewhere along the Harry Potter books. It's a nice story about a small-town popular boy falling for the preacher's daughter. She's got a secret that we don't find out about until the end of the book (though, I have to say I had guessed her &quot;secret&quot; the first time Sparks mentions that the girl has a secret).<br />I think this would be a GREAT book for a teenager or someone in their young 20s - someone who is looking for answers. For me, it didn't evoke many strong emotions, but would have had I read it when I was in my 20s.
B00005NZBN|5.0|If you are like me and think all Dylan's best was done in the 60's, I think you are going to like this album A LOT.  Every song connects directly back to one (or more) from that era.  Every song would have fit perfectly on one or another 60's album.  If you went into a cave in 1970 and came out today and heard this, you'd think, wow, still making the same great music after all these years.  I listened and DID NOT WANT IT TO END.
B000002OXU|5.0|Who's next is quite possibly the best rock album ever made.  <br />The song Bargain&quot; is without a doubt the most powerful, masculine love song ever written.  It's description of a man in love and what he would do will probably never be understood by the female gender.  Townsend, however, has expressed the very foundation of a man's emotions!  Turn it up and think about your deepest love when you listen and put forth that testosterone, daring anyone or anything to turn you back.  You can't help but grow hair at the same time.<br />This album brings back the best memories of my youth and isolating each instument and appreciating their individual talent is a favorite activity while listening to this one.
B00005OB0A|5.0|It's too easy to criticize Kylie Minogue. Her voice is a much more powerful instrument than people give her credit for. Since her 1994 self-titled album, she has proven time and time again what a stunning voice she has. It is mellower and stronger than it has ever been ... and even though this album doesn't demonstrate its beauty quite as effectively as IMPOSSIBLE PRINCESS (so far, her masterpiece) or the better songs on KM94, or even LIGHT YEARS, it's still patently obvious to anyone with half an ear that the Kylester's musicianship is something special. Kylie is the ultimate sex-kitten, a brilliant chanteuse with the staying power of the greats. It's too easy to compare her to Madonna, as well. She's in a different league. A better, more fun league! To the Americans who have missed out on her all these years: get this album for the corkers that are 'In Your Eyes' and 'CGYOOMH' and 'Fever' and 'Love at First Sight'. But get IMPOSSIBLE PRINCESS and KM94 as well. She's the Princess of Pop, she's been around for decades, she's here to stay, and you guys have been missing out! Resistance is useless.
B00005NW02|5.0|The second release from Armenian-American metal group System Of A Down, entitled &quot;Toxicity&quot;, is nothing short of incredible. It far surpassed my original idea on how the album would be. I heard most of the album before it had come out and it blew me away. <br />This album is much better than their first album. Singer Serj Tankian demonstrates that he not only can scream but has incredible vocal ability, which, I feel, is most evident on their single &quot;Chop Suey!&quot; Tankian's distinctive vocals mix with the insanity of the guitar work of Daron Malakian, who also lends a hand on vocals on certain tracks. Setting the rhythm of the songs are bassist Shavo Odadjian and drummer John Dolmayan, who add a solid and consistant power to each song.<br />There is no weak song on this album. Every song is good in its own way since each song is different from the other. Their lyrics are very diverse, ranging from the United States prison system (Prison Song) to sympathy for Charles Manson (ATWA) to pogosticks (Bounce). As diverse as they may be, they are strong. <br />I feel that the best tracks on the album are Prison Song, Deer Dance, Chop Suey, ATWA, Science, Shimmy, Toxicity and Psycho.<br />If you like the music of the newer metal bands, then this is most definitely your best bet. One of the best releases of the summer of 2001. If you are a fan of System of a Down and you don't have this album, you must pick it up. If you just got into the band from the song &quot;Spiders&quot; and don't like any of their other songs, you don't know what you are missing.
B00005OOQ5|4.0|This DVD has more acts to it than the Bravo TV special, and it's worth the purchase.  Although some of the acts doesn't &quot;wow&quot; me like newer shows, they are better than &quot;Cirque Reinvente&quot;, and the music is very nice.  My favorite part is the &quot;Film Scene&quot; where one of the clowns acts out an old time movie with three audience members.  Two complaints about the disc is that the video is dark at times, and the only extras are trailers for other Cirque DVDs.  I wish there was a behind-the-scenes look, but there isn't.

0767840135|5.0|The show is very entertaining from start to finish, and I find myself watching it over and over.  The music and acts blend very well together along with the costumes.  John Gilkey is quite possibly the best clown in all the Cirques I have watched.  Quidam is worth the purchase just to see him perform.
B00003CXBK|3.0|Was excited when I got this movie the other day.  Great animation, however the english voice over was lacking emotion.  I would cringe whenever Gilian Anderson spoke.  Also, if your use to quick paced animation, this is'nt the movie for you.  It tends to drag at some spots.  There are few fighting scenes, but when they occur, it is quite spectacular.  This movie would of benefited in cutting out some of the scenes after the fight, as it tends to slow the film down.  Interesting story at times, however the main character confused me.  He was always switching sides and never did find happiness.
B00005RDAF|4.0|I admit yes it was good but...if its going to be called the videos it should have more than 3 videos and 2 live performances<BR>i was expecting all the videos up to date.<BR>and comericials did i just pay for comercials oh geeze i guess i must like her but the only problem with this dvd is there should have been way more videos (all of em)
0446608955|5.0|Sparks never fails to amaze me with the stories he chooses to tell. I believe his books are unique and they always seem to linger with you for days and months. I can't ever seem to forget them. It is like they become a part of me. The stories, the characters, the lives &amp; the lessons. I recommend any Sparks novel including this one. Where will he go next? I can't wait to find out.
B00005OM4N|4.0|Okay, I'm a 19 year old sophomore in college, my favorite artists are Stevie Nicks, Kristin Hersh, Aimee Mann, Ani DiFranco, etc.  So I shouldn't even think about listening to Britney Spears right? Well I don't want to, and no matter how hot she is or how catchy her formulated songs are...I've been able to resist--until now.  <BR> A friend of mine forced me to listen to this entire cd on a long car ride...I had heard &quot;I'm a Slave 4 U&quot; and actually admitted it was not a bad song for what it was (plus the video helped).  Each song on the cd had a different hook and I actually heard some grit in Britney's vocals which took me by surprise.  &quot;Overprotected&quot; and &quot;Whatit's Like to be Me&quot; make this cd worthwhile and may actually help Britney break from that teen-pop thing...maybe not, what do I know?  I do know this cd is the best work I've heard from her and I have some respect forming for the girl.  Oh yeah, anyone who can sing a song with lyrics like &quot;Bombastic love, it's a fantastic love&quot; and make it sound even the slightest bit fun and not hoaky...that's a talent in it's own.
0385505833|5.0|Loved it, loved it, loved it! A quick fun read that left me in stitches at times. I'm the original scrooge and was pulling for Luther to make it to the Caribbean all the way. We used to &quot;do Christmas&quot; early and cruise the Caribbean with our teenage boys until high school wrestling practice took over our holiday schedule.  I was disappointed in the ending, not because it wasn't fun, but because Luther didn't have the fortitude to stand his ground and make it to the ship on time. Another win for the American Way and a blow for the non-traditional! I just went out and bought 10 copies for friends and family so we can discuss over the coming holiday season.
B00005QK3W|5.0|If you loved his early albums then you will fall in love with this cd.Previous reviews have harkened it to his Ram album and I couldn't agree more.This is good stuff and I don't think one can quibble about the lyrics because it is so Paul.His best effort in years!
B00005OAJ1|2.0|Jack Black is pretty funny, I've got to say, and when I first heard Wonderboy on Conan, it really clicked in my head that Tenacious D was awesome. Now that I have the CD, it turns out that Wonderboy is the only one that I really like. It just doesn't quite have the same feel as when they sing it live.
B00005RFQ5|3.0|An entire album full of deep, religious lyrics from Prince?  Strange, but true.  Musicianship is excellent throughout with contributions from funk bass legend Larry Graham and smooth jazz sax man Najee, while the string samples give the jazz-lite arrangements an added kick.  However, some of the songs seem to be stuck in 1986 (&quot;The Work&quot;, &quot;1+1+1 is 3&quot;, and &quot;The Everlasting Now&quot;).  And the deep-voiced &quot;narrator&quot; gets annoying after awhile.  Although far from his best work, this album will grow on you if you listen with an open mind.
B00005RFAI|3.0|Pink's sophomore effort Missundaztood finds the 20-year-old Pennsylvanian acting less like an R&amp;B bad girl and more like a pop-rock princess. Those expecting to find a \\"Can't Take Me Home Part II\\" are sadly mistaken. Fans of her first album must come into Missundaztood with clean ears. Gone are the urban \\"ching ching, bling bling\\" references, a new direction is evident. The once urban Pink has gone suburban, trading in the Fubu for leather and lace. Of the fourteen tracks that grace the album, only a few are R&amp;B oriented. A far cry from her first record, which featured no rock tracks whatsoever, here they predominate. Though Lilith Fair it isn't. The production on Pink's latest offering is as slick as anything on TRL (Total Request Live). The hip-hop drum patterns that she rode to superstardom during her debut are surprisingly mute; in its place are electric guitars and folk-flavored acoustics. Also absent are many dance tracks. The only solid dance track is her first single \\"Get The Party Started,\\" a post-psychedelic 60s-meets-21st-century romp. The rest of the subject matter is more introspective. <BR>\\"It ain't easy growing up in World War III,\\" she croons. There's a surprising sense of vulnerability displayed throughout the album. Here we find Pink reflective and confessional. She's a bad girl, but she has feelings. She sings about life, loss and longing. Lyrically, Pink has never been more heartfelt and revealing. Everything from parental hardship to sleazy ex-girlfriends is discussed. Vocally, Pink sounds assured and confident. In \\"Don't Let Me Get Me,\\" Pink makes an effort to distance herself from her teen contemporaries: \\"tired of being compared to damn Britney Spears/she's so pretty, that just ain't me.\\" Ironically, in her distancing she winds up sounding more TRL-esque on her latest album than her last. <BR>Missundaztood is more like a masquerade. If she isn't sounding like Tori Amos or Natalie Imbruglia, she's a dredless Lauryn Hill (\\"Eventually\\")or a female Eminem (\\"Family Portrait\\"). Where Pink lacks in artistic coherence, she makes up for in creativity. In \\"My Vietnam\\" she correlates her perils to the sounds of detonating bombs. Towards the end of the song is a sonic interpolation of Jimi Hendrix's \\"Star Spangled Banner.\\" While introspection dominates a majority of the album, bitterness never subsides. A healthy level of will power and optimism is present. Fans of the old man-eating Pink from the first album will enjoy \\"Respect,\\" where she disenfranchises potential \\"playas\\" and empowers her fellow femme fatales. The overall vibe of Missundaztood is less aggressive and more self-determined. She takes an empowered role in such songs as \\"18 Wheeler\\" and the radio-ready \\"Just Like A Pill.\\" Overall, Pinks latest album is an introspective charmer that shows the promise and versatility evident in a young and rising star.
B00005B36H|5.0|I love Tool.  I loved every album that this band has come out with.  Interestingly, I was a little let down when I first heard this album.  However, after hearing it more, I must say that it is an excellent album. Tool is still better than 99.9% of any of the other bands out there these days. But, I wonder how long that will last.<BR>Tool was not so good in concert.  They seemed to be just going through the motions, and took huge breaks inbetween songs - on top of all of that, they did not play an encore.  They employed cool visual effects at the concert, but Maynard stayed in the shadows for the entire concert - pretty dumb.  My recommendation:  buy their albums, but skip the show, and wait for some new bands to emerge.
B0000509BZ|4.0|This movie is one of my favorites.  The storyline of the film is very imaginative; the idea of someone becoming an immortal and how he or she lives an immortal life is very compelling.  Christopher Lambert is very good as Connor Macleod, the immortal Highlander, who learns of his immortality after he is fatally wounded in a Scottish battle.  Sean Connery (although it's a short part) is also great as Ramirez, Connor's mentor.  At the time the film came out, the special effects were very good, although they would pale in comparison with today's standards.  The movie is filled with exciting action sequences, especially the final battle for the prize between Connor and Kurgan.  None of the sequels that follow this original film quite live up to Highlander.
0790751305|3.0|I watched this movie in my anylysis of media class and enjoyed it.  I&quot;ve never seen a full western movie, but this one made me want to watch more.  It had all the aspects of a typical western.  The climax was the shooting seen in the saloon where Munney(Eastwood) defeats all the gunmen.  Unforgiven overturned the genre of the western in this cowboy movie.
B00005LQ6S|3.0|Christopher Lambert returns as the Scottish immortal Connor MacLeod in the third and probably last sequel to the Highlander series.  Adrian Paul joins him as Duncan MacLeod from the TV series.  The film's storyline was a little confusing to me because I never watched the T.V. series.  The movie overall is enjoyable to watch, as the two immortals battle Jacob Kell, played by Bruce Payne (overacting a little bit!).  I was mad because Connor is killed off in the film, and I'm a big fan of the movie series.  Also, the blood and gore in the movie look sort of fake, almost TV-quality stuff.  If you weigh out the good and bad points of the film, you end up with a so-so movie.
B00005NTNU|5.0|Dirty Harry is without a doubt one the most famous characters ever to be portrayed by Clint Eastwood. It was almost like seeing the man with no name being given a badge in modern times. The first film is arguably the best, for a great deal of reasons. First you have a great villain: Scorpio..completely off his rocker, who's vile and deadly..somebody you want Harry to show no mercy to. Plus this is the only film that ever gives any real insight to who Harry is and why he's become this sort of rogue cop with a vengeance. One of my favorite scenes is when he's talking to his dead partner's wife as he reveals a bit of himself to her. It's a poignant moment we never really ever see again in the Harry character. But the movie succeeds in keeping our eyes glued to the picture because we want Harry to track down Scorpio and save the girl he's kidnapped just as much as Harry does! The final scenerio on a bus is very good. A modern day classic at its best!<br />The other Dirty Harry movies are not as clever as the first film, and by saying that I mean that they're still good movies, but the 1st film is more superior. &quot;Magnum Force&quot; deals with the story of cops who take the law into their own hands (including a young Robert Urich), going a step beyond what even Harry does, thinking he'll join them. &quot;The Enforcer&quot; give a unique twist of pairing Harry with a female partner, played well by Tyne Daly (which is why I think she later ended up on the TV series &quot;Cagney &amp; Lacey&quot;). My personal favorite of the Harry films next to the original has got to be &quot;Sudden Impact&quot;, which was also directed by Clint Eastwood. It includes his all time best Dirty Harry line and has a great finale at an amusement park. &quot;The Dead Pool&quot; ends the series with some great wit and action, including a unique car chase with a little remote control car. Add Jim Carrey as a doped up out of his mind rock muscician (using Guns 'N' Roses Welcome To The Jungle ashis own song) and what more could you ask for?<br />As great as the movies are I was very disappointed in the slim pickens as far as extra features on the DVDs are concerned. &quot;Dirty Harry&quot; contains a new retrospective documentary, that is pretty good. But why didn't Warner Brothers opt to include the documentary that was included on the Laserdisc Box Set, entitled: &quot;Eastwood: The Man From Malpaso&quot;?  Magnum Force &amp; The Enforcer also contain short &quot;Making Of&quot; featurettes that aren't bad. All the other films only contain a trailer. Which means, perhaps some time down the road another box set will be released, filled to the teeth with extras (anybody remember the Die Hard trilogy?). But for people like me who have been waiting and waiting and waiting for all 5 Harry films to become available, as well as to be put together in a nice Box Set, the time to buy is now. I've never even seen any of the films in the Widescreen format (2.35:1), so now I finally can. So make your day or somebody's day and pick up the Dirty Harry Collection DVD Box Set! You'll be glad you did.<br />&quot;Go ahead...make my day&quot; - Clint Eastwood as Dirty Harry
B00005RIKD|5.0|Recorded on Sept 11, 2001, the song &quot;Fragile&quot; has a renewed meaning, and a perfect opening track.  This live concert features some of Sting's best songs, reinvisioned with new arragements.  Alive and fresh, even old classics like &quot;Roxanne&quot; and &quot;Every Breath you Take&quot; sound great.  The standout track for me has to be &quot;All this Time&quot;, sounding new and exciting.  A must have for Sting fans and fans of music in general.
B00005RDAF|3.0|When an artist releases a video entitled, &quot;The Videos&quot;, one would expect it to be a collection of videos. Instead, &quot;Britney: The Videos&quot; is a collection of three videos - &quot;Don't Let Me Be The Last To Know&quot;, &quot;I'm A Slave 4 U&quot;, and &quot;I'm Not A Girl, Not Yet A Woman.&quot; There are no other videos, unless you count &quot;Overprotected&quot; - outtakes of the movie set to the song. The DVD also includes a Pepsi commercial, an HBO commercial, and a performance from the 2001 VMAs. If you wanted a collection of Britney videos, ala &quot;Dave Matthews Band: The Videos 1994-2001&quot;, you're out of luck (as I was). To get copies of the other videos you'll have to buy Britney's other two DVDs, but you still won't get the videos for &quot;From the Bottom of My Broken Heart&quot; and &quot;Born To Make You Happy&quot;, which I was really looking forward to having. If you simply want to buy anything with Britney's name on it, I say knock yourself out. However, if you're looking for the actual DVD that the name implies, I'd recommend waiting. In the meantime, her HBO special is coming out on DVD in January and would be a much better buy if you don't feel like buying a bunch of DVDs.
B00005QZWI|5.0|As a Tolkein fan I have been waiting for the Lord of the Rings movies anxiously. And as a soundtrack afficianado I was almost as eager to hear the music for the first film &quot;The Fellowship of the Ring'. Well, it's here and it is a very exciting listening experience. Perhaps the best film soundtrack since 'Titanic'.<BR>It is rousingly dramatic, idyllic, bucolic, dark, mysterious and moving. Anyone who has visited the Official LOTR movie site and heard the sounds that play there can get an inkling of what the score is like.<BR>  The best portions are the opening which is just the kind of  ominously dramatic introduction that this epic deserves.<BR>The heroic theme for Frodo and the Fellowship members is suitably noble and inspiring. And Enya's contributions sound just as one might imagine an Elven poetess might compose and sing. They fit in well, and do not detract from the overall theme as some songs in recent films have done. The stand-out for me though is 'The Bridge of Khazad Dum'. Wow! Talk about 'drums in the deep'! Any loyal reader of Tolkein's trilogy knows how important those pounding instruments are to this part of the story. And do we get them here! One of the longest tracks it is as awesomely climactic and overwhelming as is the corresponding chapter in the book. 'Lothlorien' is another standout as the most elvishly mysterious piece. And 'Amon Hen' vividly provides the backdrop to set off Frodo's burdensome and heartbreaking decision to carry the ring alone into Mordor.<BR>   All in all a fine work by composer Howard Shore who took on the daunting task of bringing Tolkein's vast world to musical life. <BR>    I don't think LOTR fans will be disappointed.
B000002LIR|5.0|Rod Stewart is a true blues singer that always seems to come alive. This collection consists  of  that  proof,  extremely positive.  Storyteller marks the 25th anniversary since Rod began as a singer in the 1960's. Every fan will want this collection. It consists of every single track that was a hit. Some songs like Every Beat Of My Heart, and Drive My Car are very hard to find.<br />It also contains traditional favorites like Forever Young, and Young Turks. As a fan of Rod Stewart, I highly recommend this box set over any other box set ever released. It truly is a reason to believe.
0064407667|5.0|This book is awesome.  I can't put the series down.  I just picked it up one day, and I only have three more books to read.  I am kind of obsessed with it.  It is so incredibly distressing it just rips at your heart.  I love it!  It is wonderfully written, and just gives me chills.  The series gets better and better.  And you really see the children learning and getting more clever.  However, these books may not be suited for young children even thought it is written for them.  But the adventures of the Baudelaire orphans are a lot of dark devious fun!  I am going to go read the next one right now!
B00005QZWI|5.0|Wow.  Howard Shores music for LOTR has gone above and beyond my expectations.  Being a huge fan of the books and eagerly awaiting the movie, I was overjoyed to discover that the soundtrack was coming out a full month before the film.  I bought it the day it came out and listened to it and was simply BLOWN AWAY.   The closest thing I can compare it to is Basil Polidouris' CONAN soundtrack.  Most of the music is dark and full of action cues (as it should be) but never gets repetitive or tiresome.   Occassionally , the music for our heroes emerges and when it does, it is beautiful, light and wildly romantic (Enya's main theme is a jem on the CD).  Howard shore has got himself a winner here...This is simply the best score of the  year.
B00005R2M3|2.0|Like other reviewers, I too have listened to Shakira for years and have come to totally appreciate and love her music (in spanish). I was a spanish major in college so the translation never was a problem - her words were so poetic, and so heartfelt. I feel like this album is full of superficial, commercialized fluff. It sounds like she's trying to become some diva in english but the problem is her english lyrics are so uninspired, and don't hold their value like they did in spanish. The spanish songs on here are great, which is why I gave it two stars. I think putting both english and spanish songs on here was a huge mistake, especially putting two versions of the same song on here. It's like she's trying to please everyone, but when a singer does that, she inherently disappoints everyone. The greatest singers are great because they stay true to what they love and are good at. I feel on this album Shakira is trying so hard to break into a new audience that she loses what has made her great on her past albums. This album has no personality, no spunk. That's really too bad. I hope a new spanish album is coming soon.
B00005J6UP|5.0|Good Enough? I think so!<br />This movie is one of my favorites. The dvd version is spectacular. There is the commentary, deleted scenes, and the music video! Some how I had seen all the deleted scenes before? I think different channels put on different verions of the movie.<BR>The cast is great especially chunk (Truffle Shuffle). When I was little I would bury stuff in my backyard and make a map and pretend I was in the movie. This movie rises above all others and is Steven Spielberg's best other than Jaws.<br />I recommend this movie to all ages.
B000059MEK|4.0|well i think this is a good cd if you like to dance. my fav track is #4 harder baetter faster stronger. that was a good track cause its really hyper and it gives you a vive you know? well like i said buy this only if you want to throw partys and dance your thoughts away. and i think that coming from me its good cause im picky when it comes to danceing music well i give it a 4.5 and its pretty good. peace out
B00005RFQ5|5.0|This cd really shows that prince has no lost a thing. It is the bomb. I can not stop listening to it. my fav tracks are muse,everywhere,mellow,she loves me for me, everlasting now and the last december.
B00005R2M3|4.0|When I first listened to this cd, I wasn't very sure that I would like it, but after a few listens I like it. All in all, this is a good cd.  For the most part,the music is as good as was on her cd &quot;donde estan los ladrones&quot;, but the lyrics in english sound fake sometimes ( just listen to &quot;underneath your clothes&quot; and &quot;the one&quot;, prime examples of this). But, at least she is trying. A few of the songs sound more pop-ish and fluffier than the ones on the last cd, but trust me, even her worst songs sound better than anything britney spears or christina aguilera could even think about doing. Even though english is my first language and I only know enough spanish to understand most of her spanish lyrics, I still like her stuff en espanol a little better. anyway, I recommend this cd! and if you do not have &quot;donde estan los ladrones&quot; get it!!
B00005QZWI|5.0|This is a great soundtrack for the up coming sure to be great movie &quot;The Fellowship Of The Ring&quot;.  The music ranges from the lighthearted Concerning Hobbits, to the dark mysterious track of The Bridge of Khazad Dum.  The whole scope of the soundtrack creates the atmosphere of Middle Earth very well.  The Enya tracks (The Council Of Elrond, and May It Be) are also very well done.  It's Enya at her finest.  Maybe the best track it The Breaking Of The Fellowship.  That will have movie goers staying until the last credit has rolled!<br />Buy this CD now, and on December 19th, go to the movie and see the beginning of one of the greatest tales ever told!
B00005RIKD|3.0|Perhaps due to the circumstances of the day it was recorded,  this live disc is lacking &quot;life&quot;, from the audience, from Sting.<BR>Featuring 13 of his most notable songs (excluding Denda and Hounds of Winter),  Sting reworks most of them into jazz standards, sometimes it works, more often however it does not.<BR>As a great Sting fan,  I was compelled to pick it up without delay, however All This Time is not intergal to your music collection.
0345451325|5.0|I was excited to get Xbox's HALO, so when I heard about the book it sounded great. Let me just say, Wow, What a great setup for playing the game, In my opinion it enhances the Game play more then if you to not read the book. The Authur does a great job keeping you glued in, you won't be able to put it down. Read this book, I swear you won't be disappointed.
0671027379|3.0|I have read all three of Brown's novels and was disappointed with Deception Point. The plot was engaging at times, and the scientific premise is interesting. Overall, however, the book was harmed by some rather silly encounters between the &quot;good-guys&quot; and the &quot;bad-guys&quot;. The ending wraps-up much like a Scooby-Doo cartoon. Most disappointing, however, is the &quot;plug-and-play&quot; nature of this work, which unfortunately has the same feel as his earlier books. I would rate this book as an excellent work for a young reader. An adult may find it overly simplistic and silly at times.
0767817710|3.0|I give it three stars because it's not too bad. It gets another half star for all the cool gunfighting...<br />Gene Hackman is believable as an over the hill gun fighter. He controls a small town by force. He has a contest to find the best and fastest gunfighter. &quot;Single-Elimination&quot;...  :)  Lose the gunfight and you are out.<br />The bartender uses a big chalk board to keep track of the standings.<br />Some of the lowlifes and scoundrels that come for a piece of the action are pretty funny to watch. The indian who can't shoot straight and won't die. Leonardo DiCaprio as the young kid that really cocky and fast. Sharon Stone with a mysterious past and a need for revenge. Yes, she is one of the gunfighters. Russle Crowe is another mystery in this film...  Not entirely sure what his story is...  A preacher with a gun?<br />Anyway, this one is ok. Worth a look. When I see it on TV as I am flicking channels, I usually stop for a few minutes. There's always something going on....
B000059MEK|4.0|Daft Punk has outdone themselves in this highly interesting<BR>cd.  Following up on solid disco jams from &quot;Homework&quot;, the French group add simple, fun-loving lyrics and about mid-eighties samples to their already impressive style of music. Think of Kool and the Gang doing modern electronica and you have a rough idea.  It works for all its synth-pop cheesiness because of the great club beats.  And don't miss the third song.  It reminded me of an updated &quot;Word Up&quot; by Cameo, except a little trippier. Very cool indeed. So inbetween ignoring your yuppie parents and playing Commodore 64, enjoy Daft Punk's latest, &quot;Discovery&quot;. The future is now. . or fifteen years ago.
6305144176|5.0|Robin Williams is a comic genius. When he made this film, he was just beginning to show that he can do dramatic acting as well. He mixed both varieties well in this film.<br />As the film progresses, you begin to identify with the characters. And, amazingly, the Vietnamese are not the antagonists....   The bad guys are the officer and sargeant major that are his immediate superiors.<br />There are plenty of really funny scenes. There are also plenty of dramatic and action scenes. After watching this film, I wanted to find out more about Pat Sajack.<br />Definitly a good film.
068485743X|5.0|Subtitled &quot;A Writer's Guide to Staying Out of the Rejection Pile,&quot; Lukeman's book is designed not to tell you how to _write_, but to tell you how _not_ to write.  The book is divided into three basic sections:  &quot;Preliminary Problems&quot; (dealing with issues such as presentation, excessive use of adjectives and adverbs, sound, etc.), &quot;Dialogue&quot; (avoiding cliches, how not to be melodramatic or hard to follow, etc.), and &quot;The Bigger Picture&quot; (the all-important &quot;Show, not Tell,&quot; various viewpoints, hooks, and so on.<br />I think the advice on how to grab the reader with the first few pages of the manuscript -- plunging the characters immediately into conflict, and introducing a dramatic element as quickly as possible -- was most useful to me. Many other the other tips may seem subtle at first, but put together, the combination proved to be extremely helpful to me. <br />For those who immediately react negatively when told what NOT to do, I can only offer you two bits of advice:  first, when I went back and compared half a dozen of my favorite best-sellers against the advice in this book, I found that every one of them obeyed the rules to a &quot;T&quot;.  And secondly, I'm of the school that says, &quot;before you can break the rules, you've got to learn what they are.&quot;  Once they're mastered, then and only then can you make the decision when and how to break them.<br />Lukeman writes from an editor or literary agent's point of view -- understandable, given that he's a major NY-based agent -- but I think beginning writers would be wise to take heed of his words. in Like the author, I can't guarantee that if you follow the rules of THE FIRST FIVE PAGES your book will sell.  But it seems obvious to me that your manuscript won't even get past the first step if you make the basic mistakes described in the book. For that reason alone, I consider this book to be one of the most important books on writing I've read (out of several dozen).
6305064490|5.0|This movie rocks!!! Jimmy Stewart is wonderful as George Bailey. He makes the watcher feel like they are there with him throughout his stuggles. In my opinion nobody else could have captured George as he did. Uncle Billy is just hilarious!! I'm sure that we all look at our lives and think about how that they could be different, but then realize that we all make a difference in our own way. George and Mary may not have much in the way of money but they do have what counts, love and family and plenty of friends!! This movie is a Christmas classic but a good watch ANYTIME!!
B00005OM4N|4.0|Now I'm a partial britney fan, I cannot say I completely love her or hater. After one listen to this record theres no doubt that britney is growing up and desperately trieng to establish herself as a true Artist and she's half way there with this record. This album lacks Baby One More Time's sweet ballads like &quot;From The Bottom Of My Broken Heart&quot; and &quot;Email My Heart&quot;. But yet has Oop's I did it again's uptempo strong points like &quot;Stronger&quot; and &quot;What U See Is What You Get&quot;. So if your one of those  chosen few who don't regret, than just buy the album and think later!
6305014140|5.0|WOW ninja scroll was so GREAT to watch...excellent in everything..i wish they would do part 2!the charecters were so good...so imaginary!
B0000009OP|5.0|Cure for the Pain was the first Morphine cd I ever heard.  I was awe struck when I first heard it and I have never once become bored by it. Every moment in my life from my uncle dieing,or when I broke up with someone who I cared about, to seeing my sister being married seems to fit on any of the songs in this wonderful album.  It has seen me through hard and good times and I will always be thankful to the comfort that Mark's voice brought to me through his beautiful lyrics and the saxaphones playing in the background...thank you Mark where ever you are, and to the rest in the band... stay beautiful...
B00005MAM2|5.0|Akira is one of those movies that you never forget. The images are extremely powerful and graphic, so that they stick with you long after the movie is over. Despite its sometimes-confusing plot line, this movie is a wonderfully written, chilling look into the future, and into humanity as a whole. The movie more or less centers around a teenage biker gang in Neo-Tokyo, thirty-years after World War III. The main characters, Kaneda and Tetsuo, are two childhood friends who are constantly in competition with each other (Tetsuo being the weaker, taunted one.) Regardless, Tetsuo still looks up to Kaneda. As the introduction moves out of the chase scene, an interesting encounter with an odd looking child (who awakens the physic abilities lying dormant within Tetsuo's mind) truly begins the movie. <br />The animation quality in this movie is almost enough of a reason to buy it. The detail is incredible, umparalled even by Disney?s standards. No one background or setting is used twice, and the environment is in constant change, be it blinking lights or a person exiting a random building. Oddly enough, the Bladerunner-esque buildings throughout the movie also help to establish the feeling of urgency, and the sensation of teetering on the edge of something great, something that we cannot possibly understand. The characters also move in a realistic, smooth motion, something that is missing from many anime television shows, like Pokemon or Digimon.<br />The music in this movie is also an aspect that really stands out, with a sound all its own. With this new DVD cleanup, you can hear every bell, whistle and drum beat. It sounds more Japanese than most animes out there, and that is not a bad thing. Every single song fits the actions incredibly well, from the haunting &quot;Requiem&quot; at the end, to the oddly infectious Japanese drums in &quot;Kaneda&quot;, heard during the motorcycle chase scene and credits of the movie. Hats off to Shoji Yamashiro. <br />The voice acting is good, but not great. I feel that the original dubbing job used voice actors much better suited to their animated counterparts. For example, Kaneda's original voice actor fit his attitude well, as his voice had the same inflection and as a teenage boy's does. The new voice actor, however, sounds like an adult trying to speak like a teenager. Tetsuo?s voice sometimes sounds a little off too, as the inflection in his words do not always coincide with the action on screen There is no mention of the original script or dub however, but there is a small interview with the English voice actors of Kaneda, Tetsuo, and Kei. <br />The extras on this DVD are excellent, with detailed information on how the music was created, the voice actors of both the English and Japanese scripts, and it also holds about 4,500 stills from the movie and the entire movie's storyboard. The menus are easy to follow and understand, and contain colorful backgrounds with music-sound bites from the movie.<br />Overall, this DVD is a must have for any Sci-fi or animation fan. It shows the best of what anime has to offer. You will never forget the magnificent story, or the unforgettable characters that make this movie a classic, inside and outside of anime.<br />Remember though, this movie is NOT for young children and the squeamish. If your child is under the age of fifteen, or if you do not like the sight of blood and body part, the movie is probably not for you.
B00003CXAA|2.0|Very poor tranfer to DVD.<BR>Grainy, contrast too high - no shadow detail.<BR>Lots of specks and dust that should have been cleaned up.<BR>The darks are so dark that you see little or no detail, ex: Pacino's hair and dark clothing render no or very little detail, just black, you wont see any strands of hair or folds and pockets on dark suits.<BR>The cardboard cases eventually will fall apart with use in time.<BR>The old widescreen video version has better quality than the DVD.<BR>It seems that Paramount did a quickie job to get this box set out and make there bucks, and in so doing compromised the quality and attention that these great films deserve.
B00005JKHP|5.0|When this film came out in 1979, it was maligned because it was expensive and slow ( though everyone seems to conveniently forget that the start-up and development costs for Star Trek Phase II were incorporated in this budget). Many Trekkers seemed to have some vague aspiration that it was going to be a form of 'Star Wars' with Kirk and Co along for the ride, with their banter. However, I felt it showed a lot more guts to aim for a much more intellectually sophisticated plot - and in many ways is still the closest a Trek movie has come to Gene Roddenberry's view of the future. The director's edition has really turned what was in effect a rough cut into an excellent science fiction film, with 2001 style philosophical overtones - albeit ( unlike 2001) it tries to answer them. <br />The re-editing has really tightened the movie- and the sound effects are excellent though still subtle- the music still seems to come close to overpowering them at times, and some of the fx scenes that could have done with a digital clean up seem to have been missed ( budget restrictions???). The new fx however serve the film very well - though it might have been  fun to have seen more shots of a full scale Vejur - as when these shots were presented they really make an impact. <br />Jerry Goldsmith's music is outstanding - there are even some more cues. The story is now more exciting and the film's climax more effective. The commentary by the fx crew and Mr Wise is interesting and informative and some of the comments made by Mr Trumbull in the closing credits I couldn't agree with more with.<br />So, I recommend this movie as an excellent science fiction film. The only other Star Trek films that come close to this level are Star Trek First Contact and Star Trek VI ( the darkest and most dramatic adventures of the series). Watch the others if you are after more comic strip style adventures
0140186409|5.0|I read Grapes of Wrath about a year ago and the imagery is still very vivid in my mind. Needless to say, I think it's a great book and thoroughly deserve it's classic status. Granted, Mr. Steinbeck wasn't the best in prose like an Anderson or Fitzgerald but I think the most important part of a story is the story itself and Steinbeck is a great story teller. I've never felt more anger than when the Joad's were called &quot;Okkies&quot; or more sickened when they were cheated by the farm owners. The style of alternating the chapters was quite clever and I think it just sort of builds up the suspense. The ending to me is just right although a bit melodramatic, it captures the essence of hopelessness that prevails throughout the book. I thoroughly recommend this book and Steinbeck will make a cynic out of you yet.
B00005N83O|2.0|2 stars for the music and production -  0 stars for this artist's vocal ability.
B00005RFQ5|5.0|Let me start by saying that his CD is not for everyone. If you are turned off by religion or music that is WAY outside the box, you probably won't understand this CD. Musically, it is Prince at his best. He turns out more grooves on this one CD than most artists do in a lifetime. From smooth jazzy vibes to some of the hardest funk to ever come out of Minneapolis, this one has it all. It's meant to be listened to in it's entirety, and I highly recommend doing that...with headphones. It's an experience not to be missed, even if you are not a hardcore Prince fan. I don't expect much commercial success from this one since it doesn't fall into the corporate record industry mold. Just enjoy it for what it is...a 70-minute musical journey. Peace!
B00005R2BG|5.0|This movie COMPLETELY blew me away.  I've never been into musicals, and only went to see it because I was forced by a musical-addict friend of mine.  I can hardly express how wonderful it was in words!  This is not your typical musical, or movie for that matter.  I have never seen anything else like it.  It has a fast paced style and is filled with color, a visual masterpiece.  At times, the camera moves almost too fast, but it just reaches the limit with a wonderful perfection.  It's funny and it also makes you cry.  The songs were absolutely wonderful!!  Nicole Kidman pulls it all off, and Ewan McGregor is perfect.  Their voices and the songs top off the entire movie, making it my new favorite.  You'd think they both had sung their whole lives.  The CD is one of my favorites, too.  I had to see the movie again the next day, and can't wait till the video comes out.  I beg you all to see it, you will not be disappointed!
1563890119|3.0|Don't get me wrong, Gaiman is one of the best writers alive. Most of the Sandman comic books are better written then most &quot;serious&quot; literature. This one is a tad disappointing, at least compared to the other comics. Still, you might as well begin here.
0385505833|5.0|OK, it's not your typical Grisham courtroom drama but, once again, he makes a plausible argument for \\"skipping Christmas\\" in his latest book of the same title.  \\"Bah Humbug\\", I said, when first hearing about the book's premise until the plans surrounding the main characters' scheduled departure for the Caribbean sounded so enticing that it left me wondering if they might take me along.<br />While this book is not about doing away with Christmas forever, it's one couple's desire to just skip it, for just one year, and spend the money on a cruise instead.  And, why not?  Their only child Blair has just left for a stint in Peru with the Peace Corps and they are looking at spending their first Christmas alone in a very long time.  But skipping Christmas entirely means not doing anything \\"holiday\\" related at all - no cards, no presents, no holiday parties and, most importantly, no rooftop Frosty...the \\"symbol\\" of Christmas in their Hemlock Street neighborhood in Illinois.  But Luther and Nora KRANK are about to find out what the true \\"symbol\\" of Christmas really is -- whether they like it or not.<br />While their friends and neighbors are appalled at their decision to forego the Christmas festivities, Luther and Nora remain stalwart in their resolution of \\"no Christmas for the Kranks.\\"  Grisham throws some humor into many of the scenes as he has the Kranks hiding out in their own home as carolers sing Christmas songs on their lawn and then has them eating lettuce leaves in an effort to lose weight for the trip.<br />But it's the end of the book where the true meaning of Christmas will be exhibited.  It's not money spent or gifts bought or Frosty's on the roof.  It's much simpler and easier than that. The Kranks will find out that the true meaning of Christmas, in Grisham's story, is that of giving...giving of yourself. And, you'll have a good time reading how they get to this point and  hoping, just as I am, that all of us will come to this realization during this upcoming holiday season.ng holiday season.
6305736650|5.0|this is considered and regarded by many critics as the greatest movie of all time.<br />i definitely consider it to be one of the greatest anyway. there are a few others i personally consider to be on the same level of greatness.<br />Casablanca is, however, a legend. a classic romance story that has never been quite equaled. to disclose any of the plot for those of you who may not have seen it would be unjust and unfair at the least. i never liked stories of romance. i suppose most men don't, but when i decided to view this one, i was very intrigued and engrossed with the film. it is definitely one the very few love stories i ever developed any respect for. if you decide to purchase this one you won't feel cheated.<br />as for the DVD, it's a great buy. it has the trailer, production notes, an introduction by Lauren Bacall and the excellent documentary on the making of the film hosted by Lauren Bacall. all those still living that were associated with the production of &quot;Casablanca&quot; were interviewed in it. all avid collectors of the classics must have this one in his or her DVD library.
B00004Z1MN|5.0|This movie had everything a good movie should have. It had a very creative and intricate plot. It had wonderful acting. Dennis Quaid and Jim Caviezel had only one scene actually together, but they really pulled off the father/son relationship. It was interesting to see how small things done in the past had changed the future, and I thought the plot was very well wrapped up all in all. I highly recommend this movie to anyone, not just science fiction or drama fans.
6304696566|4.0|this great film is often disregarded and is given secondary priority to other films of this genre.<br />John Wayne gives one of his greatest performances as &quot;Ethan Edwards&quot;, a role he often referred to as his most favorite. the basic premise of the film is simple but engrossing enough to maintain the viewer's attention. &quot;Ethan's&quot; two neices are kidnapped by savage indians after the indians slaughter their parents. &quot;Ethan Edwards&quot; goes after the indians who did it. to divulge any more of this great plot would insane.<br />this one should definitely be regarded as one of the great westerns in motion picture history. it is indeed one the the true legends.<br />as for the DVD, it has excellent sound, good picture and ample extra features including a 3 part documentary on the making of the picture. it also has a theatrical trailer, production notes and cast bios. any avid western fan should have include it in his DVD library.
0792833236|4.0|When I first saw this movie years ago, I hated it.  I didn't like any of the characters, I couldn't follow the plot, and the language was excessively bad.  &quot;If you removed the f-words from the dialogue, you have a 20 minute movie,&quot; I told a few friends of mine.<br />I recently found this DVD for a really low price, so I decided to give it another shot.  I still don't like the characters, but the language didn't bother me so much now that I'm older.  In fact, the language tells you about how these characters think and feel.  And the movie really is a character-driven film, so the plot is secondary.<br />I loved the opening of the film.  The music is just beautiful, and the slow motion dancing of a lone, robed and hooded boxer in the ring is an image that stays with you.  The black and white cinematography is glorious throughout this film.  The costumes, sets, and automobiles give the film a very authentic 1940's and '50's feel.  The boxing scenes are beautiful and brutal at the same time.  Technically, this film is a masterpiece.<br />The greatest thing about &quot;Raging Bull&quot; is the performance of Robert De Niro.  Much has been made about his weight gain during the course of this film (and it is amazing), but the intense anger, sadness, and loneliness of Jake La Motta comes through brilliantly due to De Niro's acting.
B00005QK3W|3.0|There aren't many bigger McCartney fans out there than me.  And I'm willing to stick by him now that he's about as important a pop artist as Peter Frampton.  But for those of you, like me, who have every one of his albums, go back even 10 years and listen to the vocals.  Listen to the belts on Figure of 8, or the sweetness of No More Lonely Nights or Mull of Kintyre, or the range on My Love, or the raw (if sometimes off-key) passion in the studio version of Maybe I'm Amazed.  Now listen to these vocals.  Poor Paul whom I love dearly has no voice left.  It wouldn't be so sad if he didn't have the greatest rock voice in history.  But at 59 his voice has gone gravelly, wobbly, and out of tune.  He used to have the hugest range this side of Freddie Mercury, and now he's down to a little over an octave.  Tell me when you heard anything pre-1990 where he so consistently strained on the top and bottom.<br />The sad part is that this will only get worse.  Paul so abused his beautiful voice in his 20s and 30s that there's nothing left in his 50s.  His 60s will be really sad.  But I want to hear him anyway.<br />... have you actually listened to the words in Ram?  How do you keep from laughing?  (\\"My dog he got three legs.  Your dog he got none.\\")  Best five albums, in order: Band on the Run, Tug of War, Flowers in the Dirt, Flaming Pie, Venus and Mars.
B00005LMBK|2.0|All I can say is weird. Aside from Clint Eastwood and maybe Rock the House, there is just a lot of tracks with people saying things you can't understand. I warn you, I'm not saying that I totally hate this cd. I just believe you have to be in one of those weird moods to listen to it in its entirety.
B00005QG9J|5.0|All the people with the 1 star are in my opinion idiots! They do not know how to appreciate a band such as Incubus. Although this album is a lot softer the Make Yourself it is still at par if not equal to it. To love music is to love all forms of it. Not just rap country or hard core rock. That is exactly what Incubus did. It blendid the many styles that are known today and they made some amazing riffs lyrics and melodies. Incubus in my opinion is growing to be a great band. So if you really are a hater keep on posting your 1's. But keep in mind that you are a moron and do not really love music :P
B00004SVGE|5.0|I bought this CD after hearing an NPR Christmas Special featuring Diana Krall. I was so entranced, I had to by her music. Since then, I bought almost every CD released. I've been a fan since 1996 and cannot wait for a US Tour.
B00005IBGQ|3.0|I had the opportunity of seeing Rufus Wainwright live last night opening for Tori Amos in Phoenix, AZ. His singing was very poor: he breaths so hard between verses that it becomes a real annoyance. His playing of, both, guitar and piano was very, very basic: while some of the harmonies were interesting, the playing was that of a beginner musician, in my opinion. The one thing that saved his performance were his lyrics: they reminded me at times of Cat Stevens. As bad as the review may sound, I see potential in him, but I think he's yet far from where he can get, if he works on his playing and his singing.
B000002J09|4.0|For any true Led Zeppelin fan, it is obvious that this is not exactly their best album.  However, it IS their most famous, most marketable, and is a great album for non die-harders.  The first two albums can not be touched even if Manute Bol had a 30-foot pole.  The album is well-produced (for those who like a clean, smooth sound) and contains the most beautiful, wonderful song of all time by any band in any age... FOUR STICKS!!!!  Just kidding, you know I mean Stairway to Heaven.  However, the other seven songs can hold their own with the best of them as well.  So, if you like Led Zeppelin as a band, this is the album to have.  If you like Led Zeppelin as the irresistible force of hard rock, then buy the first two and Physical Graffiti.  All in all, THIS ROCKS!!!
B00004X0Q0|5.0|... I discovered this. As a fan of the 80's punk scene, I have just about resigned to the fact that I would not hear any new good bands. Boy was I wrong! Reminds me of Fugazi (especially the dualing vocalists) more than Rage (who they are all too often compared to). Anyway, there are few weak tracks on this CD (another surprise), but my favs are &quot;Pattern Against User,&quot; &quot;One Armed Scissor,&quot; &quot;Sleepwalk Capsules,&quot; and, surprisingly, &quot;Quarantined&quot; (most people will play the first 5 tracks so often that they tend to neglect this track as well as &quot;Non-Zero Possibility&quot;). I rarely write reviews but I was so moved by this CD that I had no choice. If you are looking for that perfect noisy, emo-hardcore, and melodic CD, look no further!
B000002HIK|5.0|like the drum and bass renditions of the soundtrack from video game secret of mana. highly recommended. as soothing/relaxing as it is grating and hurtful to the ears. buy.
0066620996|2.0|This review is based on the audio version of the book (which is narrated by the author himself).  A good part of my dissatisfaction is related to the author's delivery and 'presentation skills'.  Content-wise, although I'm not particularly impressed by those 8 or 9 'Good to Great' key concepts that the author pushed forth either, I still agree with them in most parts because I believe they are good points and they are the main findings from their 5 years research on this topic.<br />Let me now clarify my points here.  Perhaps I have much expectation on this book following other readers' comments both on this and the author's previous book &quot;Built To Last&quot;, I was disappointed when I first heard him introducing those 8 to 9 key factors on how these 11 companies turned from good to great.  I cannot dispute they're not important.  In fact I do agree they're some differentiating ingredients that are not easy for an average person/company to achieve.  However, these are HARDLY groundbreaking ideas.  It's those same ideas how you should morally behave to become a good (or great, for that matter) person that everyone would have received since day 1 of the elementary school education.  The very fact that it has taken the author and his team of 15-20 researchers 5 years's time to come up with such results that's neither deep nor thought-provoking make things even worse.  It almost made me feel like the whole book is more a marketing pitch (for these 8-9 very ideas that the author is trying to sell, on behalf of his own valuable findings in these 5 years).  <br />Perhaps it's really true that these are the defining virtues that bring these 11 great companies the ultimate greatness, no more no less, as how the author claims this to be a result by induction, from the empirical hard facts that they've gathered throughout 5 years, instead of something that were set up to prove a certain theory.  However, this hardly matters.  The truth is that the book is still not as useful as it should be because there's nothing new nor insightful about these ideas (or at least with respect to how far the author has gone to study/explain each of them).  The whole game is like &quot;okay, there maybe 50 or 100 great management ideas out there people have talked about or have been time and proven.  Let's now use a quantitative approach to deduce from stock price findings, to reverse engineer which are the 8 to 9 most important ones.&quot;  To be clear, I have nothing against this approach.  This is both a great concept and challenge.  But in my opinion this is as far as the value of this book goes, once I heard what the findings are.  The author stops short of producing further value-adding materials after singling out these ideas.  It's hardly convincing by just citing some management reform stories + stock prices performance in these 11 companies to make a strong case that these are the holy truths of ultimate management skills.  Every journalist can easily look at some companies' success and attribute it to certain factors.  The sad fact is, circumstances change and it always affect your real-time decision.  As a leader, how you cope with that does not necessarily depend on just these ideas.  There's a lot more to it!<br />The whole marketing pitch of this book becomes A LOT MORE obvious because this audio book is delivered by the author himself.  Throughout the book he carries one of those exaggerating tone, creating, in my opinon, stupid jargons (such as BHAG (Big Hairy Audacious Goal), The Three Circles, The Hedgehog concept, which were totally irrelevant) to embrace his key points .  Why?  I think that's because for a 5 years in-depth research project on 20 something companies, the book has terribly few hard facts to support his arguments, which are all good old ideas that everybody would have thought of at one point or another.  Because of this, he has to create these seemingly non-intruitive jargons to sell his ideas, to imprint them on readers' memory and to fill up enough pages (in this case, enough recording) to explain the concepts.  For that matter, he's a master of stating the obvious.  This has really annoyed me a lot for much of the recording.  My experience with the recording was very much ruined by this reason, more than anything else, on an original average to slightly (just slightly) above average content.
B0000072VM|5.0|PFM gets hyped up as one of the greatest prog bands to come out of Italy, and once you hear Per Un Amico, their second album, released in 1972, you'll know why. Their music is prog with folk, classical and some jazz thrown in. There isn't a bad song on this album, but &quot;Il Banchetto&quot; is my favorite and really shows PFM at their best. There's even some piano in there that sounds like it came right off ELP's Brain Salad Surgery (although be aware, BSS was not released until a year after Per Un Amico). But what I really love of &quot;Il Banchetto&quot; was the wonderful use of Moog and even harp. There's a lot going on here and it might need a few listens to appreciate this piece. &quot;Appena Un Poco&quot; (at least that's what it says on my LP copy, as it's also called &quot;Appena Un Po'&quot;) is very much in typical PFM fashion, acoustic, pastoral, and great vocal harmonies. This cut does remind me a little of King Crimson, it bears a small resemblance to &quot;Epitaph&quot;. There are influences from other bands like Genesis and ELP, but rarely does these influences become obvious. What more can I say of this album? If you're a lover of Italian prog, this album must be in your collection. But forget that pale English language version of this album called Photos of Ghosts.
B00003CXXJ|5.0|I think I enjoyed this movie more then my kids. Funny, cleverly written with puns all though it. I was even surprised at the end.
B00005A1PR|5.0|These are beautiful songs.  They are empowering, but not in that &quot;Girl Power&quot; pop music way.  Strength, Courage and Wisdom is the best example of what this is about.  You feel good about yourself when you listen to her.  I really can't express how much I like this album, I wish I could give it six stars.  And wouldn't you know, a woman can write her own songs, play the guitar, and be GOOD at it.  It's a spirit lifter.  She must be wise beyond her years, I feel like she's sharing something she's learned with me through her lyrics and music.  It goes together so well! I really, really recommend this.
B00003CXZ1|4.0|Loved the game/loved the movie. I could not believe how true to the game the movie was. Angelina Jolie was a perfect pick to play Lara Croft. Action packed, fast moving, over the top sets. What more can I say. If you have ever played the game then the movie is a must see.
B00005QDW5|5.0|I have to give some credit to the Pink Floyd team (both musicians and producers) as they have managed to produce new and entretaining material from already recorded or known songs such as Delicate sound of Thunder (live recording), Pulse (live recording again of already recorded material + complete Dark Side of The Moon), Is there any body out there? (The Wall live) and now Echoes: The Best of Pink Floyd. There are no secrets on this recordings as there are no new or unreleased songs on it. This compilations offers a different way to look at an &quot;album oriented&quot; band by creating an &quot;album oriented&quot; compilation. The songs are placed in such a way that each track is linked to the next as to give the impression that this a &quot;conceptual&quot; album. As for the song selection, one can definetly dissagree but the set works in giving the listener a good Pink Floy history of the Barret-Waters-Gilmour eras. For me, the cover art is simply amazing as it captures through windows pieces of some of the Pink Floyd covers and many details are hidden within it.
0385505833|4.0|funny, entertaining and moving story with a wonderful ending.  And I thought this would be another conventional 'Scrooge' story with predictable plot.
B000002ULO|5.0|This a beautiful crafted and well produce recording. McCartney gives us a great collection of pop tunes that touch us deeply. Over time, this record has aged very well like a fine wine.
B000002UJQ|5.0|OK Computer is without a doubt the greatest album to come out since the last thing Pink Floyd put out (the real Floyd-when Waters was still there).  And, certainly, people here have been comparing this to Dark Side of the Moon.  But, this album is nothing like that one (Kid A is though).  While most of the sons transition into one another it doesn't have a sense of cohesiveness running through it, for example, the song Climbing Up the Walls is a very claustrophobic and almost scary sounding song and yet is immediately followed by No Surprises which is an extremely lighthearted song.<BR>  OK Computer starts out with Airbag, a song that is short, relatively fast, and very loosely about surviving a car crash with a little bit of saving the universe thrown in for fun.  This is a great song, however, it is the one I like least of the l2 (that honor used to go to Subteranean Homesick Alien but everytime I hear it I like it more and more).<BR>  Next comes Paranoid Android which was initially my favorite song.  It starts out slowly then gets fast with a short electric guitar solo then it goes into the chanting/singing &quot;rain down&quot; section and then we find out that the early solo was only a taste of things to come as (is it Ed O'Brien or Johnny Greenwood)goes into a real kick @ss solo with distortion everywhere.  I believe this was voted one of the top 100 greatest solos ever.<BR>  Third is Subterranean Homesick Alien.  As I said before, I didn't like this song at first, but it grew on me. It is also a reference to Bob Dylan.<BR>  Exit Music(for a film) is one of the greatest songs of the last 100 years.  It starts out with some acoustic strumming and then builds to a huge climax that cools off with the repetition of the phrase &quot;we hope that you choke&quot;.  Words alone cannot describe the power of this song, it alone is worth the money.<BR>  Lately I have been listening to Let Down alot.  It is like Sub. Homesick Alien but it has a better rhythm and builds toa nice climax.  It also has great lyrics.<BR>  Karma Police is perhaps the most celebrated song on the album.  It is great.  <BR>  Well, I think it's time to wrap up.  Just take my word that the rest of the songs are brilliant and like nothing you have heard.  I really don't know how this lost to Time Out of Mind for album of the year seeing it is undoubtedly the best album of the decade (only because Kid A didn't come out til 2000).  If you like this get Kid A.  Kid A is ten times better, even if it is a little different.  Don't get put off by it if it sounds wierd at first.  Listen to it straight through while you do homework or something and after a couple times everything will click and you will realize why everyone is praising it (or maybe you aren't like me and you will love it on your first listen).  Anyway, get this, get Kid A, sit back, and enjoy.
B00005OM4K|5.0|This box set gives you the complete CCR catalog completely remastered with excelent sound. This is essencial music for rock fans. Truly some of the most powerful rock and roll ever recorded. As for the packaging, its simple with nothing fancy (just lake CCR's music!). There is a nice booklet with essays, photos and son notes that completes the set very well. If you want the complete recordings this is the definite collection.

B00003CY0U|2.0|OK, so we have yet another star-studded line-up, and big movie bucks to spend.  You'd think you would have a classic at your hands, but stick in a cumbersome director and a sloppy screenplay, and you've got yourself a bust.<br />To start, I had high expectations for Swordfish.  With John Travolta and the always &quot;hot&quot; Halle Berry, I thought I'd be entertained.  Which I was in a way.  But, not in a mind perplexing way.  <br />The goods?  Acting.  That's what kept this movie from choking on its own saliva.  But, once again, you ask the age-old question; what was John Travolta thinking?  This guy can't pay someone to like his movies anymore.  Phenomenon was exactly that:  a phenomenon.  He hasn't made a good movie since, and I don't really see any hope in the future (especially with movies like Domestic Disturbance, which I haven't seen, but I already know is probably the most predictable, wishy-washy movie of the year).  <br />And that was the goods.  Now to the bads.  We'd be here all day if I had to name them all.  I have never been a fan of the ending in the beginning technique.  It always ruins the movie for me.  And that's exactly what happened here.  Ticks me off!  And to make matters worse, the transition from the movie itself back to the ending (catch that?) was terrible!  Bad bad directing.  <br />Swordfish failed to meet any standards I set for a &quot;decent&quot; movie.  Stick a sword in this one.  2 Stars
B000003S0K|5.0|Roxy Music, Roxy Music(1972): Eno doesn't sing on Roxy records, but its here that he first appears on record and his sound is very Velvet influenced. Ferry delivers little romantic vignettes and Eno fills the background with his accomplished sense of noise. Makes for a very attractive combo. This collection of songs was one they played for a year before recording.<br />Roxy Music For Your Pleasure(1973):The experiment gets more refined on this record, Eno finds even better sounds and his intrusions into Ferry's stanzas are welcome, strangely decorating the pop room. Eno was getting all the attention in the live shows and in the press and Ferry didn't like it. This record is my favorite Roxy. Eno-less Roxy efforts make great hit records but the experimentation without Eno is less fun. Not to say that Mackay oboe and sax and Manzanera guitar do not find interesting sonic terrain, they do, their sometimes great sounds, however, serve more as grooves and textures for Ferry to wallow in. Never again does Roxy achieve the Velvety and arty schizophrenia of Eno/ Ferry Roxy.<br />Taking Tiger Mountain(1974): Ten great songs, all very different. Talking Heads would later make use of some of the strategies used on this but there are so many experiments, a virtual Eno catalogue, that no amont of punk and new wave rip offs or borrowings can diminish its originality. An essential Eno disc. Fat Lady of Limbourg will &quot;ditch you in the harbor&quot;if you don't purchase this.<br />Here Come the Warm Jets(1974): The warm jets are Enos way of describing the guitar sounds made by Fripp. &quot;Baby's on Fire&quot; is a masterpiece, but no other songs really catch fire. Nor is there the clever narrative play that existed on Tiger Mountain. This is good but does not exhibit the range of creativity that the manual for Eno pop, Tiger Mountain,did.<br />Another Green World(1976):Half of this is pop song format and half earthy and melodic instrumental. Considered by many to be Enos 70's masterpiece it is hard to resist. &quot;Sombre reptiles&quot;. The pop isn't as creative as Tiger but Eno has newer interests and they are involving words less and less. This is more excting to the ears than the later ambient records though becuse Eno still brings a pop sensibility even to the instrumentals. Exceedingly listenable music.<br />801 Live(76): Manzanera/Eno live rock project. Including Eno and Manzanera solo project songs and some 60's covers including &quot;Tomorrow never Knows&quot; &amp; &quot;You Really Got Me&quot;. Very highly regarded live art. No live album is ever essential but this one is great for kinetic gatherings of crafty minds.<br />Before and After Science(1978): Similar in approach as the highly succesful Green World. Eno continues on with the experiments of the previous record. The overall disc is not as appealing as a unit, but individually the songs are all stronger. &quot;Kings Lead Hat&quot; a real rocker. The instrumentals are very<br />accomplished,&quot;Julie With&quot;.piece it is hard to resist. &quot;Sombre reptiles&quot;.

B000051VWW|3.0|I expected a lot more from Sade after an 8-year hiatus. Don't get me wrong, I don't think that this is a bad CD at all, but it just doesn't quite live up to \\"Love Deluxe\\" or \\"Stronger Than Pride\\" for that matter. Usually with one of Sade's releases I can just listen straight through without skipping, but that is not the case here. \\"King of Sorrow\\" \\"Somebody Already Broke My Heart\\" and \\"By Your Side\\" are the strongest tracks on this album. The rest are forgettable and lacking in variety. Where are the uptempo tracks? After a while, it just kind of became background music -- kind of nice -- but bland. Perhaps they just needed to work out some kinks. (...)<br />Anyhoo, this was an okay effort, and I hope we don't have to wait another 8 years for the follow-up.
B000002I25|5.0|Every song is great from the ever accelerating organ beats and  howl that begin &quot;Back Door Man&quot;, through the great seductive invitation to  &quot;Light My Fire&quot;, and the surging  &quot;Break on through&quot; every song speaks of boundaries crossed. The band knocks  down everything in its quest to find something at the  &quot;End of the Night&quot; and the best album closer of all time, &quot;The End&quot;, ends this sixties incendiary manifesto with a lurid nightmare in which the last sacred thing has been breeched. A wild record. Every song finds its place in your ear and stays there. Each listen will have you humming a different song. &quot;Twentieth Century Fox&quot;, &quot;Soul Kitchen&quot;, &quot;I Looked At You&quot;, or if you aren't left humming it you are left with an image in your opened door of a mind as you will have after surrendering your head to the Morrison vision &quot;Crystal Ship&quot; .....everything and just the right amount of it.
B00005214X|5.0|This two disc set has a lot of heavy eastern thought running through it but mixed in are some light songs as well which are very welcome. &quot;I Dig Love&quot; for one. &quot;Apple Scruffs&quot; another. My favorite song of the set has always been &quot;Beware of Darkness&quot;, George's voice and guitar never sounded so good. Some of the songs have grown on me over the years and some have not. Upon first hearing it the sound is very impressive but after a few listens you start picking out the best songs and skipping some of the less appealing songs. Masterpiece it is, in places, but not the whole thing.  After already getting a dose of the sweet lord on the hit &quot;My Sweet Lord&quot; and another dose on his other hit love song to the lord &quot;What is Life&quot; the Indian thing begins to wear you down by disc two and it is a little forced upon you in places. The rockin numbers of the Apple Jam are not to be missed, though I wish those rockin numbers had been interspersed throughout the record. It certainly is a one of a kind record and any Beatle fan will want to own a copy. George Harrison solo records are for the most part not really all that exceptional, this was the first and by a long long long shot the best.
B00003CXZ1|5.0|I was a really big fan of the &quot;Tomb Raider&quot; phenomenon when the whole thing began on PlayStation and PC, and I knew that there was going to be a movie someday, it was just the matter of when they are going to release it. Now comes the hard part...who will be Lara Croft?! Well, I always thought that either Sandra Bullock, Elizabeth Hurley, and even Demi Moore would be among the lucky ones to play Lara. But when Angelina Jolie secured the part, man, was I going to get a real kick out of this!! When I finally saw it in the theaters, I thought that the movie was great! I loved how Angelina flew up to her chandelier on her bungee cord and the way she shoots both her guns at the same time, now that's something that the skills of an expert can handle! And now, I have the DVD of &quot;Lara Croft: Tomb Raider&quot;, and I love all the extras that are jam packed into the DVD, such as the U2 music video, deleted scenes, behind-the-scenes footage, cast and crew interviews, and much more! In closing, I would just like to say that Angelina Jolie is quite frankly the absolute best Lara Croft around. And &quot;Lara Croft: Tomb Raider&quot; is possibly one of Angelina Jolie's best films since &quot;Gia&quot;, &quot;Hackers&quot;, and &quot;The Bone Collector&quot;. This is more fun than playing the video games of this!!
B000050XEI|3.0|As usual, Enya has put out some very good songs on this album.  However, from start to finish, the album is only about half an hour long.  I don't know about anyone else, but I felt vaguely cheated by this.  In other words, if you like Enya, you'll like this cd, but put your cd player on repeat 'cause it's way too short.
0066620996|4.0|Good to great is one of the better books to come out recently on business and business issues.  In this regard, it is the first major business book for the post internet boom era as it goes back to what is the core of successful companies. <br />Collins book is not revolutionary and I can boil the whole book down to one idea. PEOPLE PEOPLE PEOPLE.  Good leaders who hire good people and have the discipline to stick to the core of their business.  All of Collins conclusions draw back to this simple truth -- you have a chance when you have the right people.<br />In some ways PEOPLE are so simple, but so difficult to achieve. Collins other points are also straightforward such as having a Level 5 Leader (the humble brilliant leader who places the company ahead of himself), Being a Hedgehog (dogged focus on the simple core issue), the Stockdale principle (having an unswaying belief that you will reach your destination -- even if you don't know how you will get there) and finally having the discipline to make this happen throughout the organization.<br />Read the book if you are looking to refresh your thinking about business.  <br />On the down side, the book does repeat itself and certain catch phrases which adds a touch of tedium to the work.  This undermines some of the power of the advice.<br />On the plus side, the writing is very strong and highly readable making you feel as if you are part of Collins' research team.  Overall, this is a work is worth the time and investment in thinking through what it means to your company.  Particularly if you are looking to come out of the Internet hype.

B00005ATQD|4.0|Among his many abilities, Stanley Kubrick had a knack for polarizing audiences, derived partly from his even greater talent for self-promotion. The controversy surrounding EWS resulted almost completely from people being led to expect something (perhaps an expensive, big name porn film) that it clearly does not provide. To the extent his promotional strategy encouraged these expectations, Kubrick bears some responsibility for the hostile reactions the film received. I saw it in its initial theatrical release with a group of about eight people. Most were unsympathetic, to say the least, but then at least a couple of us loved every minute of it.<br />I think the gist of the problem is that &quot;nothing happens&quot; in the film. That lack of action is also the film's chief virtue, however, since it means that the focus is on mood, texture and feeling. Kubrick was almost alone among mainstream American filmmakers in his interest in and occasional theft from the filmmaking avant garde. (The special effects in &quot;2001&quot; for example, notoriously borrowed heavily from the work of experimental filmmaker Jordan Belson.) Here he clearly owes a debt to such &quot;structuralist&quot; filmmakers as Michael Snow and Jean-Marie Straub, in which the length of the shot, its inexorable refusal to move along at standard cinematic pace, becomes an integral part of the film's effect and meaning.<br />Not that EWS is an arty, avant garde film. Kubrick simply learned lessons from such filmmakers and applied them to a standard narrative. The resulting mood-as-meaning will delight those of us interested in seeing films that explore the medium's formal potential, but make most viewers itch to keep moving. To say EWS is an old-man's film is, in this context, the highest praise. Every moment testifies to the director's absolute control, his fanatical, obsessive insistence on a technical perfection that only an extremely talented artist at the end of his career could accomplish.<br />EWS is by no means for everyone. Not only action film fans will be disappointed. People expecting an in-depth evaluation of a marriage in crisis will also probably be put off, since the subject is really secondary to the formal brilliance with which it is expressed. It is not in any sense a &quot;deep&quot; film, except in the one way that matters: it expresses an utterly singular vision with no respect for pre-conceptions, only an insistence that the film has to be made, the way the director believes it should. I suspect that for this reason, EWS will eventually be recognized as Kubrick's greatest film, after &quot;2001&quot; and possibly &quot;The Shining.&quot; <br />One final note: let's give Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman credit, not just for having the courage to make this film at all, but for their defense of it after Kubrick's death. In today's Hollywood, stars usually care only about whether a film will help their careers. Their determination that EWS be released in the manner Kubrick intended deserves our praise and thanks.

B00005QDW5|5.0|I am not all that familiar with Pink Floyd to be perfectly honest. I have listened to a lot of my mother's Floyd tapes in admiration but have never actually bought an album. When I heard about Echoes - The Best Of Pink Floyd, I salivated. <BR>This double cd has GREAT MUSIC on it. I am becoming a much bigger fan now. This music is genius. Everybody knows 'Money,' 'Hey You,' and 'Another Brick In The Wall (Pt. 2),' but the real gems are with the much longer songs, which don't receive the radio play. Sure, the original cuts may be better than the slightly edited versions. Maybe the original albums are better, but the music on these two cds is nothing short of great; plus it's beautifully remastered!! The production sounds better than many cds produced today. People should focus on the music that is on the cds, and not what they wish were on them. There is no such thing as a perfect package, but Echoes is very close. It has all of their classics. This is perfect for neophytes like myself, or for people who want to hear great remasters of GREAT MUSIC. Enough said....

B00005QZWJ|5.0|I've been an Amazon shopper for a number of years and this is the first time I've felt compelled to enter a review. I've waited a long time for Tolkien's books to get the film treatment they truly deserve, and if this soundtrack is any indication, this is one fan of all things Middle-Earth that won't be disappointed. The score seems to capture perfectly the mythic proportions of good and evil that Tolkien brought forth in his novels. The magic - hobbits, elves, dwarves, orcs, wizards, Rivendell, Lorien, Mordor - it's all here and I can't wait to see (and hear) it on the big screen.
B00005N9CV|3.0|I really enjoyed all of Diana Krall's previous CD's.  Own them all. So it was with great anticipation, I bought this CD. But it is simply not her best.  Every song on the CD is slow, slow, slow. They are just alike, one after the other. The CD just drags. &quot;Besame Mucho&quot; and &quot;Cry Me a River&quot; are the best songs on the CD. They are also probably the peppiest songs on the CD.  I love a torchy ballad and Diana's sultry voice is perfect for them.  But here, they go from slower to slowest.  Don't play this CD while driving, you'll fall asleep at the wheel. Diana's CDs are fun to listen to.  Not this time.  Try again, Diana.
6305508550|5.0|This is one of those quirky, highly quotable films that even if it's not great cinema, it holds up to repeated viewings much better than most.  In other words, a cult classic.  If you've ever been bored out of your mind at work, annoyed by chirpy co-workers, patronized by an idiotic boss, frustrated by office machinery or just plain not interested in going to work, you're eligible for membership in the cult.  Yes, there are some flaws.  The plot is inconsistent and the ending is too predictable.  But these are minor quibbles.  There are so many scenes that are perfect jewels of comedy that you can forgive this film any little lapses.  The acting is uniformly great, and I think we can all agree that we need to see a lot more of Ron Livingston.  My personal favorite scene is his meeting with the consultants, but there are so many to chose from that it's really not fair to select just one. Buy the DVD because you're going to be watching this movie again and again.

B00000373U|5.0|First, this album is a work of genius.<BR>Second, here is why you should buy it. &quot;Either/Or&quot; is Elliot's 3rd solo release, following 3 albums and several EPs with the Portland indie/grunge band Heatmiser. I can't speak for &quot;roman candle&quot; or &quot;Elliot Smith,&quot; but i can tell you about this album...which is one of the best i have ever heard. <br />As several other reviews said, this album has an ethereal, acoustic sound, best compared to Simon and Garfunkel or Nick Drake. The songs - short, but beautiful - are vintage Elliot, with moody, depressing lyrics generally about the girl who got away - and why it's his own fault. &quot;Nobody broke your heart...you broke your own cuz you can't finish what you start,&quot; he chants over and over on &quot;Alameda.&quot; Elliot utilizes both complex, Dylanesque lines along with simple, powerful phrases like the chorus of &quot;Ballad of Big Nothing&quot; to create truly moving songs...and if that's not enough, Elliot is a fine singer. <br />The highlight of many songs is the vocal melody, especially on the bright &quot;Rose Parade.&quot; Elliot's trademarke guitar work is here, of course - his pick/strum chord-oriented songs comprise the bulk of the album. The music stands on it's own, yet creates a suberb backing for Elliot's singing and lyrics. This is one of his best albums, and i would consider it stronger than XO, which has been more universally acclaimed (even by this website!). A few standout tracks - of course, the songs from Good Will Hunting... &quot;Ballad of Big Nothing&quot; &quot;Say Yes&quot; and &quot;Between the Bars.&quot; The entire album is great, however, with not a single weak track. <br />You should pick this one up - everyone should give &quot;Either/Or&quot; a chance, because someday it will stand as one of the finest albums produced during the 1990's...and maybe ever.
B00005QZWJ|5.0|Okay, so I don't know yet the movie is breath-taking. But everything I've seen so far has taken my breath away, including this soundtrack. The music is powerful, beautiful, and, in a word, perfect. I have no personal favorites, as the whole CD is incredible. However, &quot;Concerning Hobbits&quot; always brings a smile to my face, since it sounds as thought everything about hobbits were brought to music. &quot;Many Meetings&quot; brings the Council of Elrond to music, combining the power and majesty of the Elves with the fanciful nature of the hobbits. Both of the numbers from the mines of Moria &quot;A Journey in the Dark&quot; and &quot;The Bridge of Khazad Dum&quot; make your blood run cold as you almost feel the balrog breathing down your neck. And &quot;The Breaking of the Fellowship&quot; made me cry the first time I heard it. Literally. Imagining what's going on during this part of the movie (edited for those who haven't read the books) and listening to Shore's moving piece brings me to tears. The Fellowship theme is heart-breaking, yet sweet. In short, this soundtrack is everything it should be and more. The only downfall is it makes the days between now and the release of the movie seem all the more further away.
1573300403|5.0|The HIStory On Film, Volume II DVD is an AWESOME disc for those who wanted MORE after buying HIStory On Film or is a suuuper DVD for any collector or Michael Jackson lover. The only fault in the DVD is that it must be flipped to view the second session of its content. It is STILL DEFINITELY a 5-star DVD! It's only a little annoying when you're loafing, dazed by the Michael magic, to pry yourself from your sofa to flip the disc. <br />Side One is a collection of the greatest performances and classic hits (2 which weren't on HIStory On Film). The compliation is a nice little memory trip. If you're a kid, it is nice to catch some of those old moments that you weren't around to see.<br />:::Side One:::<br />~*~ Teaser [from 'HIStory' Album]<BR>~*~ Motown 25: Billie Jean Performance [ Michael Jackson's first MOONWALKING !]<BR>~*~ Beat It<BR>~*~ Liberian Girl<BR>~*~ Smooth Criminal (phenominal full-lenth video)<BR>~*~ 1995 MTV Video Music Awards Performance<BR>~*~ Thriller<br />Side Two may have been separated from Side One because of its content. Michael Jackson has always liked to be family friendly in his lyrics and videos. However, Side Two features 'SCREAM' in which Janet Jackson flashes the finger, and 'You Are Not Alone' with Michael Jackson and his beloved ex-wife Lisa Marie Presley next to nude. You will still want to watch the 'Earth Song' video which is, to say the least, stunning and 'Brace Yourself', an awesome collage sort of piece.      <br />:::Side Two:::<br />~*~ Scream<BR>~*~ Childhood [song featured in FREE WILLY 2]<BR>~*~ You Are Not Alone<BR>~*~ Earth Song [an emotional masterpiece]<BR>~*~ They Don't Care About Us [South American version]<BR>~*~ Stranger In Moscow<BR>~*~ Blood On The Dance Floor [Refugee Camp remiX]<BR>~*~ Brace Yourself [klaleidoscope of Michael-mania]<br />The whole DVD aims to please and is stellar!

B00005RIKD|1.0|Wow...I can't believe I wasted [dollar amount] on this cd!  Sting let his fans down with this one. He goes off on this Jazz binge. I have been to many Un-Plugged shows and been super happy, but I would have been let down seeing this one.  Sting needs to be in touch with his fans who made him rich and not think everyone will keep buying his music because he put it out. This cd is less than 12 hours purchased and getting exchanged.

6301174240|5.0|Many can remember watching this video as a little kid or a teenager and loving it. Luckily, it is still one of the greatest musical/visual spectacles out there. But be warned, while the film is still magical, it may seem a bit to some like going back to Disney World for adults who watched the film as a child. Amazing, but not like it was at the time. The video is pretty timeless, but the best of special effects then may not have the wow-effect today.<br />The review may be broken down into each section of the video. This film contains:<br />-'Man In The Mirror' [concert footage/tribute to great peacemakers]<BR>-'A Retrospective Of 24 Years Of Hits' [history as of 1988]<BR>-'Badder' [cute kiddie remake of 'Bad']<BR>-'Speed Demon' [CLAYMATION sequence}<BR>-'Leave Me Alone' [short film]<BR>-'Smooth Criminal' [the 45-minute feature]<BR>-'Come Together' [concert at the end of SMOOTH CRIMINAL]<BR>- and as the 'THE MOON IS WALKING' song played through the credits by an African group called Ladysmith Black Mombazo.<br />- Man In The Mirror is a great 'BAD' concert recap which successfully gives the respect to former men and women who have 'made that change' while showing off Michael's undoubtable charisma onstage. Uses a good bit of the split screen technique, which was a revolution back then.<br />- The look back at the '24' years of Michael's history is great. It traces 'ABC' to 'BAD' flawlessly, with some neat high-tech transition animations aiding it and gives lots of hard to find clips of little Michael. Nice little set up of memoirs and newer memories like 'Thriller', 'Beat It', and 'The Way You Make Me Feel'.<br />- The 'Badder' features a group of little kids in a mini-Michael Jackson bad cover. It's flat out cute, and the kiddies do a good job. You still get the feeling that no one does it like Michael.<br />- 'Speed Demon' is cute and is a comical view of what Michael's life is like with his tremendous fame. The segment combines CLAYMATION with live action fairlywell. The short features &quot;Spike&quot; the rabbit, as well as an all-star cast being spoofed by the CLAYMATION creators. Very cute!<br />- 'Leave Me Alone' is a classic short film. The bizarre carnival theme laughably, yet with a severe undertone shows the rollercoaster ride which the Tabloid and media have locked Michael Jackson into. Sometimes scary, sometimes funny or cute - the piece is unique and meant to mock and illustrate the bogus media mayhem.<br />- 'Smooth Criminal' is, though I won't spoil it, full of awesome dancing and an adorable adventure. Michael Jackson, Joe Pesci, and son of legend John Lennon - Sean Lennon. The music video portion is beyond belief and your kids will be trying to mimic it eternally. The action/adventure storyline is fun (a bit corny), but meaningfully set against drugs. A sort of blend between Star Wars and E.T.<br />- 'Come Together' is an awesome performance. The Beatles hit is performed with much enthusiasm and forms a nice triumphant little ending. <br />- The credits and behind the scenes selection is also very nice. The sort of chant is accompanied by the group doing some cute little dance with bits of Michael and graphic element sequences dispersed through out.   <br />Altogether A GREAT family film that adults will love and children will cherish. Catches your attention and keeps you happy throughout. You'll LOVE it!<br />                                             - AnDie
B00005RFAI|5.0|I've always liked Pink's style. This abum is very exciting and raunchy and she still has a great voice. I definitely recommend this album!
B00005R2M3|5.0|Shakira ROcKS!!<BR>This CD is one of the best CDs out there! Shakira will do really good with Laundry Service!<BR>And about you people that dont understand her...practice english cuz i really can understand her voice! she is soo amazing. Well maybe sometimes I am like its this or is that...get it? only in some lyrics! like any rock artist! just listen to Ramstein and tell me what u understand there =p or ANYONE sometimes u stay like what did s/he said? same happens here but I can understand everything! she doing really good! smart girl IN 2 YEARS and she knows how to talk and write in english. YOU GO SHAKI
B00005RFAI|2.0|I like Pink.  I loved her first album, with cuts like &quot;Most Girls&quot;, and other hits.<br />&quot;Misunderstood&quot; will be just that to her fans.  The first single &quot;Get This Party Started&quot; is the only stand out hook central song on this CD.<br />The rest of the CD falls flat with just middle of the road rock blunders like &quot;Lonely Girl&quot; with 4 Non Blondes Linda Perry, &quot;Misery&quot; which is miserable with Steven Tyler, &quot;Family Portrait&quot; is just depressing sappy rock, and the CD gets number with &quot;Numb&quot; and &quot;My Vietnam&quot;.<br />I give Pink respect for trying a new direction in the rock arena, but by completely throwing your R &amp; B roots and sound out the window from the fans who made you double platinum off your first CD is beyond my comprehension.<br />Unless Pink can find a new fan base with &quot;Missundaztood&quot; she will be misunderstood and her album will falter.<br />This sound is nothing new, and with Linda Perry at the helm who was a 1-hit wonder, brings Pink down.<br />This CD is nothing like her debut album.  Sorry Pink but this CD goes back to the record store for trade.<br />2 stars for the reason Pink wanted to artistically try to take chances, unfortunately it doesn't work.
B00005R2M3|5.0|this is a really good CD! i like all the songs specially POEM TO A HORSE!!<BR>and about that guy that doesnt understand a word what she says in live TRL...<BR>hmm practice your english! seriously! =p <BR>I did understand her! she was amazing in there<BR>Shakira rocks!!!
B00005QZWI|5.0|After listening to this album several times I find it pretty darn cool. There are some tracks that are truely amazing, I love the Uruk Hai them and at the entire oppisite end of the spectrum the mellow Hobbits theme.  It a mix of ideas that works. Worth the cash.
B000059HAI|4.0|Seeing the awful ads for &quot;Pearl Harbor&quot; in late 2000 made me want to see &quot;Tora! Tora! Tora!&quot; again.  I had remembered seeing it as a kid and enjoying it, and when the DVD was reissued in a better edition in the spring of 2001, I bought it the day it came out.  I was not disappointed.  I had thought that perhaps my memory had been kind to the film, but it was just as spectacular as I recalled, and more surprisingly, I found the commentary track on this DVD to be excellent.  Most DVD commentaries are pretty throw-away (save those by Steven Soberbergh), but this one was very enjoyable and informative.  What was a throw-away was the historical documentary included.  I would have appreciated another documentary on the making of the film itself.
B00005RG6B|5.0|This DVD is an absolute must for all Queensryche fans. I went to this show is Kansas City back in 1991 a couple of days after this  show was recorded up in LaCross, Wisconsin. I was completely amazed at Geoff Tate and the Bands Theatrics. I have been a die hard Ryche fan since 1985 when I saw them open for Kiss. The DVD is amazing and the sound quality is awsome. The album (Operation Mindcrime) is by far my favorite, and the concert is beyond words.<br />Buy it........
B00005KFUM|5.0|In the context of this album, mentioning the R word would only serve to demonstrate that heads and holes in the ground are not the exclusive behavioral domain of ostriches.<br />This album offers a bombastic assault on the senses. Likely, at some point in the not too distant future, to be proclaimed as the first great pop album of the millennium generation.<br />Bleeding marvellous.
0385501560|1.0|I've said it once and I'll say it again: I do not enjoy reading fly paper.  Since Fight Club, Chuck's artistic integrity has taken a pretty hard blow--it's on the ground for the count and nearing its last breath.  &quot;Cohesive&quot; and &quot;coherent&quot; are no longer in the guy's vocabulary.  With this knock out, I'd say Palahniuk is strong evidence that Zoloft causes mental retardation.
B0000026NC|5.0|I read what's posted and have to ask what they were listening to. Obviously not what I hear in DSoT. This is my favorite. Pulse is better on visuals, if you get the video, but falls woefully short on both sound quality and richness. On DS of T, Gilmour cuts some guitar riffs which makes you feel deprived when you hear the original CD cuts on the radio, and the saxaphone wails here, where whoever they used on Pulse is only &quot;there&quot; and toking on Prozak. Pulse has one cut that I really value -- &quot;Terminal Frost,&quot; a rich, vibrant, and pulsating instrumental. But for the best of Pink Floyd, for an incredibly rich, powerful, masterful performance, you can't do better than DS of T. Even better, the video is as good as the CD, plus you get some ladies who wail on Great Gig in the Sky, who also look great doing so.
B00005OM4N|4.0|ok, i am not like this huge britney fan, but i think she is cool and i like her a lot, i am just not a die hard fan.  Ok, when i previewed the album [...] everything sounded the same and it sounded a lot like her last cd.  So i went and bought and listened to the entire cd and it's not all that bad.  I do here a sorta of majority level, but not a lot.  It still sounds like stuff from her last album, but otherwise, it's not all that bad, really, if u like pop, u should get it.  The best song i think is \\"overprotected\\".
B000002B35|3.0|&quot;Pulse&quot; is, in my opinion, for the visually oriented. It is absolutely fantastic in visuals, the lasers, etc. But I find it soulfully lacking in the music quality (which is very contrary to some other reviews). But I can only compare it to &quot;Delicate Sound of Thunder,&quot; which is the best I have found of Pink Floyd live. There is one cut, which I've found nowhere else, that shines in this CD . . . &quot;Terminal Frost.&quot; It, to me at least, stands by itself as an incredibly rich instrumental. The rest of the cuts can be found in a much better rendition on other CD's, the majority on &quot;DS of T,&quot; which has David Gilmour at his best on guitar riffs, and a wailing saxaphone, which is woefully &quot;just there&quot; on &quot;Pulse.&quot; I bought DS of T first, then Pulse at a later date, expecting more and better. I was disappointed.
B0000004V2|5.0|and i know it was released in 1989.
B000002UAF|4.0|This CD is denied it's fifth star due to the fact that someone made a big mistake in subtracting the four instrumental songs.<br />I would really appreciate it if someone knew a source for them elsewhere.
0790738074|5.0|I feel compelled to write this brief review, as I know that there are some people out there who have never seen The Music Man movie.  I have a friend who has not seen the movie (or show), but soon will.  Whenever anyone asks me what is my favorite Broadway Show, I tell them that it is The Music Man.  In my humble opinion, The Music Man is what Broadway Shows should be.  I want to be taken away to a world different from that of our own problem-filled world, even if for only a short while.  I want to hear music written by people who know how to write music and lyrics that come from the heart and not the gutter.

B00005LOUQ|4.0|Watching How the Grinch Stole Christmas every Christmas is a tradition to my family, we do it every year. So when I found out Jim Carey was starring in a new version of my favorite Christmas tale, I knew I had to go so it. So in mid-December last year my mom and I went to see it. I tell you, some people may think that it takes away the joy of the story but I loved it. I'm not the type that can't stand remakes, I usually like them just as good, or better. This goes a little bit further than the original story but it still has everything in it. Definitely a must for any Grinch fan.

B00005JKOV|5.0|this is the best film ever created...i am glad to see something like this rocking the screen. i will never ever forget this film...
B00000IAU3|4.0|I looked at the Lyrics for &quot;Hunter&quot; and concluded that it makes an allusion to either the Greek Mythological Character Daphne or Diana.  Daphne was a huntress, most regarded for that and not her (lack of) beauty, who Apollo fell madly in love with ...she did not want him though, so she begged her father to somehow make him stop chasing her and he turned her into a laurel tree.  Apollo was a descendant of the Olympians, Son of Zeus and Leto and twin brother of Diana (Artemis)...Goddess of the Hunt.  The reference could have been made to either one.  Did anyone else notice that?<BR>Also, DIDO is a greek mythological character- the daugher of Belus, King of Tyre.  Interesting eh?
B000059H98|5.0|This is a killer flick!  How do I describe it?  The Adventures of Xena Across the Eighth Dimension?  Gwen Stefani Beyond Tuhnderdome?  \\"Dune\\" goes cyber-ska?<br />This film is a sci-fi-post-apocalypse-post-holocaust-feminist-action-adventure-coming-of-age-comedy, so naturally it was destined to cult-hood!  Good!  It belongs on the list of great cult films!<br />What makes this film so great?  It is off-beatness.  Great casting.  Killer sets and special effects.  Lucas said that behind every sci-fi story is a human story.  Tank Girl, part of the folk on the fringes of a post-apocalyptic society, is motivated by the murder of her lover by the Water and Power Corp, sort of a 1984-Brazilesque mega-conglomerate that controls electricity and water processing.  Imagine Hitler running your local utilities.  Isn't that Mr. C. Montgomery Burns?<br />Another aspect is the opposing tension between Tank Girl and Kesslee, which reminds us of Clarice Starling and Hannibal Lecter from \\"Silence of the Lambs\\": male-female, old-young, strong-weak, rich-poor, experienced-naive, sociopath-sane, boring-fun. And behind it is a subtle sexual tension-though, gladly it is never realized.<br />To their credit, they adapted the underground comic correctly to the screen, and you even see quick animated excerpts from the comic as links between the scenes.  The Mask, Mystery Men, and The Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles helped pave the way for this, and of course the godfathers of all comic-to-movie metamorphoses are Batman and Superman.<br />You could tell they cast was having fun with their weird script, and that energy shows through.  A great lighthearted film that has something for everyone!
B00005QZWI|5.0|i believe you should let the music speak for itself. so you're sitting there, reading this, asking yourself &quot;hey, how's the music? does it adhere to the emotional themes of the book? it's large epic in scope? is it non-john williams-like-cheesy?&quot;. all i have to say is that it is quite the amazing work. i've enjoyed shore's scores for cronenberg, but this sets a new standard on how to compose and conduct music for a film. what's the sound like you ask? take &quot;the duel of the fates&quot; mix it with kilar's AMAZING &quot;dracula&quot; score throw in a little of jerry goldsmith's &quot;the omen&quot; and a touch of carl orff's &quot;carmina burana&quot; and you have some semblance of this work...although not even close. the score is beautiful, but most importantly....SCARY AS ALL HELL. personally, i do not recommend listening to it in the dark, as you'll have much trouble sleeping. booming horns, crashing cymblals, pounding drums, gothic chanting...this makes &quot;duel of the fates&quot; sound like a sleepy yanni piano piece. this score either makes you want to triumphantly mount a steed and ride through a forest brandishing your broad sword against orcs, running at full speed...or cower in fear, hiding from the black riders. like i said, it's beautiful but beware...if loud booming horns, or pounding battle drums are not your cup of tea...then i recommend avoiding this one. if the music is this good, i can barely comprehend how good the film will be. with peter jackson at the helm, amazing effects and sequences, faithulfullness to the book (runtime of 2 hrs. 58 min.), you can be sure i'll be there dec. 19.
B00004SCX6|4.0|This album is certainly good, and the hits \\"Oops...I Did It Again\\", \\"Lucky\\", and \\"Stronger\\". Are great. The only slow song is really \\"Don't Let Me Be the Last to Know\\" but that's OK cuz she sounds real good in it. i wud recomend this album 2 ppl who wont b dissappointed without slow songs and luv pop/dancing songs.
B00005R2M3|5.0|I am a long time fan of Shakira and have all her CDs. Let me tell you Laundry Service is by far her best CD. It was very well worth the wait since her last cd Donde Estan los Ladrones which is now my second favorite. As I am fluent in English and Spanish I do not have to base my my rating in issues with language. Shakira's new material is definitely better in all aspects, lyrics, music, quality of the recording, and as nice bonus she looks extremely HOT now. Way to go Shakira!
B00003CX5P|1.0|People claim that it would have been impossible for this Star Wars to live up to the expectations from the previous movies.  I believe that they are just looking for excuses for why this movie is as bad as it is.  Lucas' main flaw was trying to target the movie towards eight year olds (ie &quot;humor&quot; used, Jar Jar, etc.) Another disappointment was the acting.  Liam Neeson is about the only actor pulling his weight in this movie, and that simply isn't enough to cut it.  The performances of Anakin and his mother feel totally unbelievable and Queen Amidala continually has a &quot;pained to take the effort to say these lines&quot; expression. This DVD is barely worth renting, simply for the extras and the fact that this is an episode in the Star Wars series.  Other than that, don't buy it.
B00005OAIE|5.0|This album deserves more credit and popularity than it's been getting. I'm a DJ and interviewed John, who is a hard working guy with a great ear for music and an excellent guitar player.<BR>His music closely resembles the David Gray or Dave Mathews format but really he is in a league of his own.<BR>Most of his music is based on personal experiences and that is why it's easy for me to relate to.<BR>His music is very complex and almost overwhelming especially '83'.<BR>There is no overall for this album only a &quot;you've got to buy it now&quot;. <BR>Not only does his music sound great on CD, he even sounds better live. Don't ask me why, but John believes that his concerts are his real work and his album.
B00003CXTF|3.0|Okay, there were good things and bad things. Bad things first, about the first half-hour. This was the stupidest thing I've ever seen in my life, I mena come on. Okay, we're here to see a movie about the attack on Pearl Harbour, at least that's what I got from the title, but aparently I was wrong, because for about 45 minutes, all they were doing was making stupid love references, I'll go to a chick flick for that, I want to see action, call me shallow but it's the way I am. I was sitting in my movie seat thinking to myself, &quot;Okay, good scene change maybe they'll start to....no wait, more idle chat&quot; Another bad thing was FDR, they could have found a more convincing actor to portry him. There were great things too, such as them not portraying the Japenese as total evil slimeballs, because the average soldier person was merely brainwashed by the militant government and thought they were doing a good thing. They were only trying to protect their families, granted it was a bad thing, but we could have, and probably did, do the same thing. I also enjoyed the special effects and all of Cuba Gooding, Jr.'s part, he was great. Any way, go see the movie and decide for yourself.
0452282152|3.0|I did enjoy this book, and really wanted to give it more than an average rating. It is short and quick, so I was able to keep reading... and waiting... and waiting. <br />I wasn't just waiting for something to happen (as there is movememt and action in the book) but waiting for the characters to actually develop. They just never seemed to make sense, and nothing they did or said felt 100% &quot;right.&quot; They are all wholly unsatisfying. Most have the beginnings of getting some depth to them. Catarina, Cornelia, Pieter, Maertage, and even &quot;the Master&quot; ... but we are given no reason or understanding for their actions. I kept reading because I thought, &quot;okay, maybe she'll turn interesting.&quot; But no - it's like eating just a salad for dinner- and waiting for the rest of the meal to arrive.
0679735909|5.0|One of the most moving books I have read in years. Hard to sink into, but believe me, it's worth the trip. The last page had me in tears. I read parts of it over when I want a spine chilling rush of beautiful literature.
0887306667|5.0|Of all the Trout and Ries written books, this is my favorite.  It is the simplest, easiest to read, and yet is so profound.  The title chapters alone provide tremendous insight.  I particularly liked \\"The Law of the Ladder:  The Strategy to use depends on which rung you occupy on the ladder,\\" and \\"The Law of Duality:  In the long run, every market becomes a two-horse race.\\"  It's nice to see that after all these years, this book is still selling strongly.  It's a testiment to its value.
B000001FY9|5.0|This is a wonderful collection.  All the Bob Marley greats are here, apart from Kaya and Easyskanking from the Kaya album.
1583762027|5.0|I've been listening to Brian Tracy audio cassette programs since the mid-1980's and have always been impressed with his committment to research and the high-quality of advice.  He has always been a prolific producer of self-improvement materials without the hype of a Tony Robbins.  In &quot;Eat the Frog&quot; Brian chunks down and simplifies the time management process into 21 easy and clear steps with action steps at the end.  This book may be the best book for many people who want to accomplish goals and manage their life.  I think every company should buy copies of this book and give them to their representatives especially if they need something to read for air travel.  You can get the gist of it in a day, but use it for a lifetime.  I know that Brian could have written a 300 page book if he wanted to, but this one is handy, simple, and profound.  For me personally, I'd like to see a second edition of the book with some diagrams, cartoons, and pictures.  That would make this book a little more interesting and fun.
B00005RFAI|5.0|I loved her first CD and I like this one even more.  Certainly this CD is not the same R&amp;B bumpin' beat CD that her first CD was, but that's ok.<br />The lyrics of a song is what matters to me and good music just makes the lyrics sound better.  I like different kinds of music and there is a mix of different styles on this CD.  Rock, Alt-Rock, Blues.<br />The best thing an artist can be is transparent.  Pink is not hiding a thing and that is what draws me in.  The honesty in her creation is what makes me love her music.  She has never been a formula produced for the masses.  She is a true artist sharing her life with the rest of us.<br />Thanks Pink!
B000056WTH|5.0|The best of the Mad Max trilogy (its predecessor was the cult classic &quot;Mad Max&quot; itself and its successor was the oft-maligned &quot;Beyond Thunderdome&quot;), the post-apocalyptic &quot;Road Warrior&quot; remains a gripping adrenaline-boosted thrill ride nearly two decades after its release. It's been shown dozens of time on cable channels but still is fresh and vivid.<br />The key to its power is the stripped-down nature of the narrative and the use of character archetypes. We don't know much about Max, and we don't have to. He's a wanderer, a loner, a lost soul. We've seen this character many times before, and we already know his motivations and that he'll end up doing right, despite his apparent amorality.<br />The villains are duly villainous, and indeed, memorably vicious. The good guys are appropriately virtuous, but, as the twist ending shows, cleverer and more brutally pragmatic than they seem.<br />Mel Gibson, at this relatively early point in his career, is rightly low-key and subdued, and avoids the self-congratulatory smirkiness of his recent films. Bruce Spence as the daft and opportunistic Gyro Captain also turns in some nice work. Virginia Hey, who later memorably portrayed Zhaan in TV's &quot;Farscape&quot;, has a small role here as a warrior woman for the good guys. And who can forget Emil Minty as the Feral Kid? (Actually, I just like saying &quot;Emil Minty&quot;.)<br />But really, characters aside, what carries the movie is the epic car chase in the finale, one tanker truck and its handful of defenders versus a convoy of motorcycles, pickups, and dune buggies. Everything about the chase scene is done perfectly, from the performances to the effects to the musical score. This high-speed kinetic ballet careens along full-throttle through a pyrotechnic nightmare of devastation and chaos. It has yet to be topped.<br />Fittingly, the movie ends on a melancholy note, with Max still in the wilderness, a man alone. The now-aged Feral Kid, the narrator, provides the coda: &quot;As for the Road Warrior...he lives now, only in my dreams.&quot;
B00000IAU3|5.0|This is what a good pop album should be.  All the MTV divas could learn something from her.
0553275569|3.0|. . .but there were a number of reasons it doesn't score 5 stars, at least in the mind of this reviewer.<br />There is no doubt that Wolfe has written a very, very good &quot;novel&quot; (history, really) about the great test pilots of the 1950's and especially the Mercury 7 astronauts.  He as gone far to try to make the story as accurate and honest as possible.  For this, he should be commended.  And frankly, the book was just plain fun to read, especially for someone (like myself) who is a staunch supporter of the space program.<br />However, I was put off by Wolfe's casual writing style.  Yes, it's a personal beef -- but this is a personal review, and I just didn't resonate with him stylistically!  More serious, though, to my mind, was what the book 'did' -- and that is, to seriously deconstruct a myth.  The men (and their families) depicted in the book, were (and to a certain extent, still are) heros in the minds of many Americans -- in a time when American badly needed heros.  And to my mind, Wolfe trimmed those heros down to size.  I'm not convinced that this was necessary -- or a good idea.<br />No, I'm not naive.  I realize that ALL heros have feet of clay.  I'm just not sure that it is appropriate -- or healthy -- to exploit that clay.
B00005O3VD|5.0|What more can be said now about the talents of Barbra Streisand?Her Oscar winning performance was an incredible tour de force which established her as one of the great talents of the 20th century.  This is one DVD worth owning if you are a fan of the movie musical as well as Ms. Streisand.  The second half of the film seems a bit over-extended but the musical sequences make up for any lulls along the way.  I'm happy to own this one and feel nostalgic looking back at the early career of a great star.
B00005O5CM|5.0|Isn't there that joke, &quot;Dumb Blonde&quot;?<br />The movie Legally Blonde will prove that little phrase otherwise.<BR>In this movie, the glamorous blonde Elle Woods(Reese Witherspoon) goes to Harvard to win her ex-boyfriend who dumped her because he thought she wasn't smart enough.  Elle trying to get the love of her life back goes to Harvard to prove that she isn't dumb.  When she gets to Harvard, she finds out that her ex-boyfriend is engaged to this girl, Vivian.<br />Elle goes to do manicure and do her hair to get rid of her sadness.  Did this work? Well, kind of.  She just gets by each day until the party that Vivian had one day.  She is told by Warner at that party that she wasn't smart enough to be in Harvard.  Elle proves it wrong by starting to study hard and actually succeeding in class!<br />This movie shows how facts about a girl's life such as how to get your hair permed, keeping in the latest style helps Elle win an important case.<br />In the end, Elle dumps Warner, her ex-boyfriend, when he proposes to her and dates another guy(Luke Wilson) whom I can't seem to remember the name.<br />In all, this is a hilarious movie worth watching.  You can see that the people who actually enjoys their life sometimes have more success and that blondes are not always dumb.

B000021YQV|5.0|A dynamic and intense follow-up album to their self-titled debut, System of A Down's Toxicity contains many vast political and social views depicted within a metal environment.  The CD's uniqueness surpasses any of which I have seen from a metal in the current time.  It is a mixture of various styles of music as viewed in aerials there is a light acoustic guitar with mellow vocals but in songs like prison song and X you get more of a metal vibe.  The vocals on this CD were in my opinion what sets it apart from the rest of the current CDs out in this genre, they are very vibrant and go from a slow melodic beat to a rapid out roar of screaming and heavy guitar riffs in a matter of seconds without loosing its composure.  Its very unusual for a band to show such diversity but System of a Down does it with such a style that it has compelled me to listen to it over and over for a countless amount of days now.
B00000BKDV|5.0|After Maiden released &quot; Number Of The Beast &quot; in 1982 to great success, they had to release a follow-up that would capture the intensity and ultimately be better. In fact the only things keeping this album from being perfect are the atrocious &quot; Quest For Fire &quot; and the annoying &quot; Die With Your Boots On &quot; They would reach perfection on 1984's masterpiece Powerslave. I'm a harsh grader and I try to give a great idea of what the song is like. Anyway here's my grades.<br />                                         Song Grades<br />1. Where Eagles Dare-Maiden's best opening track and best combat song. This song has a classic guitar solo. Definitely in the top 5 maiden tunes. It's got the same format as The Duellists of Powerslave, intro-vocals-long instrumental-bridge-ending vocals. The guitar solo actually feels like a plane flying through the mountains like this song is describing.<BR>     Final Grade-A<br />2. Revelations-If it weren't for &quot; Hallowed Be Thy Name &quot; this would be Maiden's greatest achievement. It comes really close to beating out Metallica's &quot; Creeping Death &quot; as the best song about Ancient Egypt. On their next album they would make an excellent sequel to this song in the name of &quot; Powerslave &quot; Everything about this song is perfect. You just got to hear it.<BR>     Final Grade-A+<br />3. Flight Of Icarus-It may sound a little cheesy, but this song has a good guitar solo and is enjoyable and I like the part where he says &quot; his eyes are ablaze see the madman in his gaze &quot; This was their first single released from this album.<BR>     Final Grade-B+<br />4. Die With Your Boots On-Here comes the first misstep in the CD. This song may be catchy the first couple of times you hear it, but by the fifth time you'll be skipping it. It may be a live favorite, but the chorus is annoying. I like the guitars in this song though.<BR>     Final Grade-C+<br />5. The Trooper-This is perhaps the song Maiden is most known for. It's a great combat song, but not as good as &quot; Where Eagles Dare &quot; This song perhaps was the inspiration for Metallica to do the classic &quot; For Whom The Bell Tolls &quot; one year later. <BR>     Final Grade-A-<br />6. Still Life-I think this is one of Maiden's most underrated songs. This song kind of serves as the unofficial title track because of the lyric &quot; nightmares, give me piece of mind &quot; Really haunting song about nightmares.<BR>     Final Grade-A-<br />7. Quest For Fire-competes for worst Dickenson-era song with &quot; Invaders &quot; , &quot; Deja-Vu &quot; and the especially putrid &quot; Assasin &quot; off &quot; No Prayer For The Dying &quot; It's one thing to have a song that's slightly cheesy like &quot; Flight Of Icarus &quot; but that song's still powerful and memorable. The cheese-meter is going off the scale on this song. The lyrics stink and the vocals stink. This song is 3 minutes and 42 seconds of unintentional comedy. The only thing that's keeping me from giving this song an F is that It's sometimes a guilty pleasure to listen to.<BR>     Final Grade-D-<br />8. Sun And Steel-Good song about  an ancient samurai. This song however doesn't fit the theme of this album. I put on my copy of  &quot; Powerslave &quot; after the two swordfighting songs. The guitar intro is especially good and so is the 1st verse.<BR>     Final Grade-B+<br />9. To Tame A Land-the epic of this album. Harris the bassist even says that its the best song he's ever written. I disagree because &quot; Hallowed Be Thy Name &quot;, &quot; Revelations &quot;, &quot; Rime Of The Ancient Mariner &quot;, and some other songs are better. This is still one of Maiden's best epics and one of their top 10 songs. It's based on the book &quot; Dune &quot; but they couldn't call it that for legal reason's.<BR>     Final Grade-A<br />I think this album served as Metallica's influence for &quot; Ride The Lightning &quot; You can clearly hear the influence. In fact this album could have been better than &quot; Powerslave &quot; if it wasn't for &quot; Quest For Fire &quot; and &quot; Die With Your Boots On &quot; Still 7 out 9 isn't bad. In my book that's a classic.
0812550706|5.0|Ender's Game is truly one of my most favorite novels I've read lately. I think that it's plot is very interesting and Ender, the main character is very easy to relate to. <BR>    The book, about a young boy plucked from his home and sent to a training camp for soldiers who are potential beings who may save the Earth from alien buggers in a lengthy war, is very clever. Ender is moved up in ranks early and leads a team of inexperienced kids around his age in a game that the base is centered around. The most interesting part is the descriptions of Ender's feelings and how he copes with the high expectations and the pressure of being a prodigy and expected to save the Earth.<BR>     The novel has a very surprising twist at the end and is most definately worth the time to read through it. There are also many sequals and books that just add on the the storyline that are also exremely interesting, but not quite as good as this one.
B00005NNU4|5.0|The Album 'wildcard' consists of 18 beautifully composed tracks.<BR>Sananda does not stop to mesmerize, tantalize or thrill the listener at any time.<BR>He remains one of the most eloquent lyricists to date and if you enjoyed 'Symphony or Damn' and 'Vibrator' you certainly won't be disapointed with this one.<BR>The power of his sandy, 5 octaved and delectable voice remains unheard of.<BR>If 'Introducing the hardline according to...' was better than <BR>Beatles' 'Seargent Pepper' then 'Wildcard' is better than 'Abbey Road'.<BR>Godess bless TTD/SANANDA MAITREYA for his profound and sincere nature and talents.<BR>PEACE OUT.
B000056K04|5.0|This is an amazing album from a great band that has metamorphised into a new and beautiful thing.  The writing and performances are the finest ever from this band that I was sure could not get better than the fantastic I already thought it to be.  But this album proved me so wrong.  For the last 2 months I have worked this album into my daily listening, it ages well. Everyone I know that cares at all for music* thinks it rocks - yet it is subtle too, and here lies most of its newest excellence. It satisfies on many levels, and I end up listening to it as background (for its infectous cool beat) and then sometimes I pour all 2900 watts of my amplifiers into my living room speakers and let it blast, floor and walls shaking.  Thrilling and clean - a very tight and non-fatiguing production. Sonically, I prefer a touch more mid-bass and low bass in the mix, but the DMB bass kicks a-- and its extremely clean and articulated if not earth shattering, relative to the mids and highs that is. Speaking of the bass, Dave's bass player is at his very finest on this album.  The entire band sounds inspired and freshly energized, this is a new classic album for sure.  My currently favorite song &quot;When the World Ends&quot; is so outstanding on several levels from viseral to intelllectual to emotional - just awesome.<br />- David R. Smith<br />* Only folks I know who don't really like this album are previous DMB fans who loved and locked into Dave's earlier excellent style. But hey, there's more than one flavor of excellence!  And IMHO, this album begs for a high quality and powerful stereo.
B000000W5L|2.0|Only a few good songs on this highly overrated album that its almost too much to bare. The High points are: &quot;Tumbling Dice&quot;: a<BR>good rock song with an excellent ending; &quot;Happy&quot; is a great Keith Richards rock 'n' Roll song; &quot;All Down The Line&quot; and &quot;Rocks Off&quot; are good rockers. The rest is crap: Bluesy tunes which I don't deny are musically well crafted but uninspiring to say the least , not my style of music at all and honestly speaking anyone's. And this is why people call it such a great album because technically its impecable. If you like blues go for the more traditional stuff. These other songs also have a southern flavour...If you like that type of music your better off with Allman Brothers or Lynyrd Skynyrd. If you really want to torture someone just make them listen to this album every day for a month, I promise you they won't have their sanity anymore. Better yet make those people who gave this album 5 stars listen to it everyday for a month. However, I think that would just be too cruel.
B00003CXZ4|5.0|I've been flipping through the one-star reviews for this movie (more than I would have expected) and there are a few themes which are repeated in these viewers' complaints:<BR>- There was a predominant artsy-fartsy, pseudo-intellectual air about the film.<BR>- &quot;I couldn't follow it!&quot;<BR>- The ending stunk.<BR>- We don't really find out what we want to find out (i.e. that the main character is an unblemished hero).<br />Here's my response to these thoughts, because I would hope that these poor reviews won't deter people from experiencing this movie: <br />Yes, there's probably a artsy sort of pseudo-intellectual thing going on here. That comes from the pseudo-intellectuals themselves, however, so they can choose how to view it if they like, and you can do your own thing. If there's one thing you should pick up from this movie, it's the idea of perception being reality, so if you get yourself caught up in the artsy-fartsy intellectualism, you'll probably concede your chances of enjoying the movie. It's a movie, not a textbook... enjoy it, don't take it too seriously.<br />If you can't follow the plot... I can't help you there. You might want to consult your doctor about a possible ADD affliction, though. <br />If you had a problem with the ending, well, you're not alone. I loved this movie, but when I watched it the first time I was pretty disappointed with the ending. I guess it comes from our &quot;big Hollywood film&quot; conditioning- there's always gotta be something at the end. I contend, as everyone else does, that this film defies convention. I, however, believe it defies convention in other ways aside from the obvious &quot;back-to-front&quot; presentation. We're slapped with an ending which is neither tragic nor joyous. It's just kind of there. What you make of it is up to you. If you choose to take the 21st century prepackaged hyper-caffeinated approach, then you may find the ending to be completely lacking any substance. On the other hand, if youkeep your mind open (and it should be WIDE open after 90 minutes of this brain-twister) you might find something else. I won't tell you what to find; if I did, I'd be one of the same pretentious, self-appointed intellectuals that draw the ire of a typical average Joe moviegoer. <br />Finally, what I enjoy most about this movie is the character development. I read a complaint that we never get a grasp of who each character truly is. I think that's true, but I think that's what makes it great. There can be poor character development which makes us wonder who is who and renders us unable to discern between good and evil, and then there can be brilliant character development which aims to erase the fast food mentality of black and white, prepackaged archetypes and the like. I'm not sure anything in this movie is necessarily brilliant, but I do enjoy the fact that we DON'T know the characters and their integrity. What we're left with is an introspective on truth in relation to perception. We're also reminded that guaging human morality is a fudgy proposition- we know what we're supposed to do, but even the best of us aren't always inclined to do so. Each of the three characters who are the main foci of this movie are difficult to read- are they friend or enemy? Are they rife with malicious intent, or are they ordinary people put in extroardinary situations in which they must conduct themselves with less-than-admirable behaviors? It is painful to some viewers that they can not differentiate between hero and villain, and that may be why this movie is not for everyone. Whatever the case may be, you are cheating yourself if you don't give this movie a fair shake. It is a tremendous movie which will surprise and shock you as well as make you think. <br />Of course, I could just be full of it too.
B00005QZWJ|5.0|Now I am just an average consumer who happens to love &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;, so my review of this score is probably oversimplified.  I purchased this and expected a lot, as I do also from the upcoming movie.  I can tell you with great certainty that this has fulfilled my expectations.  The music is beautiful yet haunting, and has a great epic quality about it.  There is a &quot;Fellowship&quot; theme of sorts that repeats in some way throughout the score; it is subtle in some places, and in others, like &quot;The Ring Goes South&quot;, it takes center stage. I really love the unified theme, the continuity within the work as a whole. One of the things I noticed off the bat (again, not a music expert, so forgive me) is that the theme seems to tie the whole score together, all the way to &quot;In Dreams&quot;, which is very poetic and moving.  One of my first thoughts on listening to the score was that perhaps the theme was not repeated enough, but listening to this for two days, I wouldn't have it any other way:  The theme is nuanced at times, and, at least for me, left me wanting more... more of the fellowship theme, more of this enchanting music... I want to see the movie, with THIS MUSIC... NOW!!  Shore has crafted a work that does not pound you in the head repeatedly, but takes you along a journey which is completed as we sit and watch the film on our about DEC. 19th.  If this score and what I have seen of the movie in commercials and previews are any indication, this will be HUGE.  This is something I'll listen to, not simply because it is associated with the movie, but because it is really a great cd.
B00004YRQA|5.0|I've never used another type of memory card, so I can make comparisons. But this one does the job, plain and simple.
B00004Z459|5.0|Finally, for the first time in a long time, a band comes along that really makes you think, and reallly rocks!! These guys are amazing. They successfully mix rap and rock, and awesome riffs, good beats, and insightful lyrics into one album. Yep you heard me right, insightful. &quot;Hybrid Theory&quot; is just that and more. It is sad, awesome, and even moving. I cannot think of a band that mixed good music with insight since the grunge movement. They have the potental to be a modern-day Nirvana. Chester's melodic vocals and Mike's awesome raps are amazing. They have so much charisma and potential. If your debating about buying this album hesitate no longer. I garuntee it we be a staple in your CD player till there next album comes out. It's even worth paying the list price. This is money well spent. They better reward this insightfull and rockin album with a grammy, becuase their style and emotion would make Kurt Cobain proud.
B00000IN5G|5.0|..now being a thirteem year old, all that i hear is limp bizkit and korn (korn got pretty old after the first couple of cd's). but one day, my older brother showed me &quot;deadnight warrior&quot; off of Something Wild, and i suddenly found what i was missing out on. Death metal. I immediatly went out and bought Something Wild and was blown away. So a week later i went and bought &quot;Hatebreeder&quot;. At first i was skeptical, thinking &quot;how culd this be better than something wild?&quot; i was completely wrong. After listening to the first two tracks, i was hooked. The guitars are so fast and cool sounding, the bass is loud and clean, the vocals are youre typical death metal vocals, but they're singer's voice never EVER get old or annoying. And the drums are UNREAL! while listening to &quot;downfall&quot; (i think its the best song on te album) my jaw was on the floor because of the incredible fast drumming. Also the keyboards give the songs an awesome surprise. The keyboardist is very fast and sounds great along with the drums and guitars. Now if you'll excuse me, i've been listening to this cd, so i gotta go find my jaw....
B00005K3O4|5.0|This movie is great!  Although it is difficult to tell whether it is supposed to be scary or not, it raises eyebrows.  The shadow puppet scene and the soundtrack make this film awesome.  It's the kind of film made for people who just want to relax and have a little laugh, not critique.  Also, the music video at the end makes it all worth while!
B00005QK3W|4.0|Well i just wanna say that i think it's a very good record, certainly one of his best. And i also wanna say that you can't compare him with Bob Dylan (which by the way is most overrated 'old rocker' of the last years). Everything Dylan puts out is rated as brilliant, while everything McCartney does is never good. Just forget the past (and stop comparing him with that great little band) and listen to what he's doing now. It's a far better effort of making real music than Dylans latest.
B00005R2M3|5.0|First of all, I want to comment on critics who say the meaning is lost in translation on \\"Laundry Service.\\" Some critics have attempted to compare \\"Laundry Service\\" with her former work. It is true that the brilliant \\"Donde Estan Los Ladrones,\\" is her most outstanding work thus far. In fact it is pure brilliance. <br />But you cannot compare these two albums!! \\"Donde Estan Los Ladrones,\\" was fully done in a romance language that can be fully appreciated: Espanol (Spanish). While the majority of the tracks in \\"Laundry Service\\" were done in her newly-found language: English. Last, music is universal, and musicians share with the world the talent that emanates from them, so while her music may not be at its best in a new language, her effort is inspiring. <br />That said, Laundry Service stands all on its own as an awesome, eclectic fresh debut from a very beautiful singing, creative and awe inspiring artist; Shakira. Note that on the back of the CD is says, \\"Entire album produced by Shakira.\\" Friends, this is the truth! This woman emanates TRUE non-manufactured, raw, poetic, eclectic, lovely talent! Her unique, unforgiving, soaring, and flowing vocals, reminds the first time listener of a modern day Latin Janis Joplin in terms of power in the voice, crossed with Natalie Merchant?s soothing pipes, and Alanis Morisette?s angry voice ultimatums. Not only is Shakira's voice powerful and multi-versatile, but her stage presence, along with her eye candy beauty, makes her the complete all around diva. She can easily polish a heartfelt ballad, and rock like the rockera she is. That is what sets her apart, and that is why she has had worldwide success. <br />The first track on her mostly English cd, ?Objection (Tango)? is my favorite song on the CD!! This song is so awesome! I felt like a kid in a candy store listening to it more than a month and a half before the CD was released! I knew it would stir up some great sentiment! Objection is a tango song with a hard driving guitar and rhythmic singing that fits nicely. Track 2 ?Underneath your clothes? is a great ballad! WOW! The bridge in the middle is just what the song needed too. It?s almost an aside and then she comes back into the chorus; it works well! Track 3 ?Whenever, wherever? is a great song with an awesome debut video to match too! The hard, yet, subtle drums add life to the song and Shakira?s vocals paint a great picture! Track 4 \\"Rules\\" opens with a great guitar and rhythmic drum sound. The song is good. Track 5 \\"The One\\" is a great ballad that incorporates a soothing introduction and a continuously infectious hook! Love it! Track 6 ?Ready for the good times? lights up the room with a Selena disco medley beat! Track 7 \\"Fool\\" has a paceful beat and truthful lyrics that get your attention! It is a love rock ballad! Track 8 \\"Te Demo Madrid\\" is a great track that makes you want to get up, and dance and sing!! It has nice elements of alternative music mixed with rock and pop, the harmonica is great too! Track 9 ?Poem to a horse? is a rock song that has a very meaningful message in the lyrics. Track 10 ?Que me quedes tu? has a great Oriental type of intro with a flavoring 60s guitar, and then is warms into a ?Sombra de ti? (one of her former songs) type of singing and music beat! Love it!! It is a great ballad with soft touches mixed in with some up beat tempo. Track 11 ?Eyes like yours? is the English version of Shakira?s ?Ojos Asi.? This English version pails in comparison to the original Spanish version. I do like the chorus, but the non-chorus parts sound very awkward. Track 12 and 13 are Spanish versions of her English songs on the CD that are just as good as the English-language counterparts. <br />Shakira is only 24 years old and I cannot wait for all the good music and love that is too come from her! This will hopefully prove to America and the rest of the world, that true talent should rule the music world. Move over manufactured fakes, Shakira has taken the throne in theEnglish market and previously in the Spanish market. Very soon, she will become a long lasting, cementable international star.

B000001ES9|2.0|This is the 1974 debut album from Canada's greatest progressive rock band, though you wouldn't know by listening to it. In the late 1960's, guitarist Alex Lifeson and bassist/vocalist Geddy Lee, along with one-time drummer John Rutsey, formed Rush, a working class band in the suburbs of Toronto. They had been gigging for 6 years by the time they cut their first full length album, and it shows mostly a strong reliance on their touring roots, and a little of what they would become over the next 25 years. <br />The album starts off with the upbeat 'Finding My Way'. It's very straight forward and typifies what much of the recording world was putting out at the time; hard, working class rock &amp; roll. Geddy's unrefined howl is in full bloom here, as well as Alex's heavy guitar crunch and Rutsey's fitting, but basic, rock drum patterns. Lyrically and musically, the band's Led Zepplin influence easily shows through here.<br />Certainly, at least two classic Rush staples came from this album, 'Working Man' and 'In the Mood'. 'Working Man' is about as straight forward as it gets, with Geddy giving such insights as &quot;when I get home, at 5 'o clock, I take myself out an ice cold beer&quot;. But whatever it lacks in grace it makes up for in execution, and the extended guitar break makes for perfect jamming material in concert. 'Working Man' was a regional AOR hit. 'In the Mood' should have been the big single, though, with a delicous guitar riff and appropriately persuasive lyrics. Fortunately, it still shows up in sets from time to time.<br />'Need Some Love', 'Take a Friend' and 'What You're Doing' are very basic rock numbers, almost throw-aways in their lyrical simplicity. But the catchy riffing and sense of fun keeps it just above the line.<br />Other notable tracks include 'Before and After' and 'Here Again', a definate ode to Led Zepplin with it's slow build, extended guitar solos and retrospective lyrics.<br />John Rutsey departed the band with medical problems soon after the album was released, and Rush picked up Neil Peart, a drummer head and shoulders above the former, and along with the ability to write thoughtful and engaging lyrics, would give the band the boost they needed to rise above the crowd. <br />This album does not show Rush as shining progressive-rock gods in waiting, but it does reveal a few clues to the listener of things to come.
B000007T2Z|5.0|If you feel like a prisoner in your own life, you will appreciate this music.  The beginning hit me especially hard.  The stoicism of the spoken word is truly a rapture in itself.  It brings you closer to what you have always feared.
B00005RFQ5|5.0|Prince has reinvented himself once again. He has ditched the stiff drum-machine pop of his recent work in favor of a live and ferociously versatile band, creating his most organic and consistently innovative music since his genius output of the late-'80s.<br />Loaded with biblical references, the record opens with a stylish, jazzy groove under a sinister electronic voice setting the stage for the tale of the &quot;Rainbow Children.&quot; It's deep, cryptic stuff - although thought-provoking all the same, touching on race relations, sexual roles and spirituality. Along the way, Prince is in fine form. He glides effortlessly from shades of James Brown to beautiful soul ballads to fantastical musical hybrids that defy comparison. The music here is bold, challenging and often wildly experimental. Production and musicianship is flawless. Standouts are too many to list. There are some bewildering and stunningly self-indulgent moments here and there, but it is never boring. Musically, the album is a mix of jazz, funk and Broadway musical with newcomers Najee and John Blackwell firmly making their mark. New girl group Milenia and Kip's vocals are also a revelation. Prince plays tribute to his musical heroes Miles Davis ('The Rainbow Children'),Andreas Vollenweider ('Digital Garden'), James Brown (on the dirty funk workout 'The Work Pt1'), and Stevie Wonder('Everywhere'). But he saves the best for last: the Sly Stone themed funk opus &quot;The Everlasting Now&quot; and the indefinable &quot;Last December,&quot; which develops from a gentle ballad to screaming guitar rock. With The Rainbow Children, Prince reclaims his place as a peerless visionary of pop music.Overall, a daring album that deserves classic status.
6305090564|3.0|this would have been a much better movie if baddies werent so hokie,and that noisy sidekick would have bit dust sooner(like in 1st 5 min).the effects were very good,but a better explaination as to the origin of the beasts,and a clearer reason for them attacking ship would have been usefull.treat williams was his grumpy self,femke was stereotypical as the badass rebel girl.the gist of this movie was treat and his merry band of sailors lend their services out to some baddies.they are to transport baddies to a yatch that is celebrating its maiden voyage.apparently a hijack is in the midst.unbeknownst to all is that the ship has been singled out for some really old,really hungry semi extinct over grown sea urchins.much chaos ensues when hijackers find an empty ship and lots of ''red stuff''.the plot/acting is nothing to brag about but there are quite a few scares here and the ending is better than most.this fast paced,often gross thriller/horror flick wont disappoint many and may even make some hope for a sequal. ...
B00005RFQ5|5.0|OK, I'll admit that ever since &quot;Sign O' the Times&quot; came out, I eagerly await each and every new Prince album that hits the stores.  An artist as prolific as Prince has so much music to share, he consistently puts out a new release every year, sometimes more.  Some are hits (&quot;Emancipation&quot;, &quot;Diamonds and Pearls&quot;,  &quot;The Gold Experience&quot;) and others are near misses (&quot;Lovesexy&quot;, &quot;Chaos and Disorder&quot;, &quot;The Black Album&quot;).  However, you can be sure that on every record there's at least one or more tunes that are PURE FUNK!!   This album is no exception. <br />Ever since Prince left his long-term record label, Warner Bros., and has released albums on his own label, NPG Records, the 'Purple One' just keeps getting better and better!   This album finds Prince much more relaxed, with hints of jazz, R&amp;B, and dance music interlaced throughout the record.  With this latest effort, Prince has released a 'concept album' that follows the tale of 'The Rainbow Children' through their banishment by 'The Wise One'.  Using a V-Box to distort his voice to sound like something from the intro. to &quot;1999&quot;, he narrates the story throughout the album, and you can choose to follow the tale or not.  <br />Rainbow Children touches on topics such as religion, sex, and racism.  Familiar ground found on many other Prince albums, but this one feels more personal. The album feels more relaxed than past efforts, as if Prince is comfortable in his own skin, making his own music, and inviting us to join him on his funky journey.  After listening to this record three times already today, I felt compelled to write my first review.  This is an amazing album!!  He mixes tempos throughout the record, shifting from dance to romance.  But the one thing that remains consistent is Prince's ability to lay down a GROOVE like none other!  Even the slower cuts have a rhythm all their own.  And the funky cuts ( and there are plenty!) just make you wanna move yo' body! <br />Standout selections begin with the first cut, &quot;Rainbow Children&quot; which sets up the story about to unfold.  Other standouts are &quot;The Work pt. 1&quot;, which reminded me of a combination of &quot;Sexy M.F.&quot; and &quot;Housequake&quot;. The lyrics of &quot;The Work&quot; sound more like gospel, but if Prince is the one preaching, you know it's gonna be funky!   My other favorites include &quot;1+1+1=3&quot;, &quot;The Everlasting Now&quot;, and &quot;Family Name&quot;, an 8 minute+  cut that begins with distorted mechanical voices (ala Stephen Hawking) discussing some heavy topics,  and ends with some of the funkiest grooves I've heard in years!!  If you listen closely, you'll even hear Prince give some funk to the act 'hocking a loogie&quot;!! <BR> <BR>This is a concept album, with a clear story that unfolds through every few songs, but one in which you can choose to follow or not. Is this release going to convert any new fans to Prince's music??? Probably not.  This record will probably have the casual Prince listener shaking their heads, wondering what the hell Prince is trying to say, or losing interest before making it through the entire story.  But for those of us who are willing to let Prince take us into his vision of the future, and allowing us a peak into his soul, this record is just what the doctor ordered!!   Case in point:  &quot;The Everlasting Now&quot; features the line, &quot;U know, this is funky, but I just wish he'd play like he used 2, old scagglyheaded....&quot;<br /> That pretty much sums it up: Prince is able to recognize this is not the kind of stuff he used to put out, but one that is of a more personal nature, with references to God, the Devil, the Banished Ones, etc.  And yet he can still find a way to laugh at himself while laying down funky grooves around his message.  And as long as Prince continues to put out music that challenges, sizzles, (even confuses!) and ultimately encourages the listener to have a little faith in God, then maybe he's right....&quot;We need 2 come 2together....Come 2together as ONE.&quot;<BR>Peace....
B00005QHPQ|2.0|His new CD was a major disappointment for me.  I expected songs like his last CD, his old spanish songs, or even like the single &quot;Hero&quot;, which is great.  However, most of the stuff on this new cd have this cheesy dance beat running though them.  It sounds hollow and flimsy.  I'd sell back the cd, but i'd never make back what i paid for it.
B00005QK3W|5.0|Macca is in danger of becoming consistant again! Not since the 70s has he released 4 strong original albums on the trot. The best thing about 'Driving Rain' is the melody is strong again - 'Flaming Pie' was great, but none of the songs had a really memorable tune. 'Lonely Road' starts with the line 'I tried to get over you' and is nice way to start such an experimental, creative album by exorcing the demons of the past on track 1.<BR>'From a Lover to a friend' is a nice ballad that Paul sings really well.<BR>'She's given up talking' is about a school girl that's being abused/bullied in some way - and actually sounds quite nasty..!<BR>I've read some reviews slagging off the title track for its '12345' line.. but why? Since when has the key to a good Macca song lay in the words? 'Driving Rain' is catchy as hell and the production/arrangement of the song is execellent. <BR>'Magic' is a song that grows on you, and 'Tiny bubble' is definatly a white album 'Piggies' clone!! Infact Macca has imitated Harrison twice on this record, cause 'Riding through Jaipiour' is certainly something George could have written with its Indian theme!<BR>'Freedom' is a powerful anthem which I guess most people know was written for the New York plane-bomb victims. It doesn't have a lot of words in it - but Macca sings with real conviction and is therefore an emotional track.<BR>'About you' and 'Rinse the raindrops' are the 2 heaviest tracks on the record.. both 'Back-to-the-eggy' and both great.<BR>My favourite track though is 'Your way'. It's just so dam catchy!! It's in my head right now! It sounds a bit like 'country dreamer' off Band on the run...<BR>Overall this album has a nice Wings flavour to it (where 'Flaming..' had a beatles flavour). I can't understand why some people have given this 1 star - ok the words aren't Pauls best; but the words on 'Ram' were no better and I bet those same people gave 'Ram' 5 stars. The melody on this album rules! Buy today...!
B00005QY5Y|5.0|Very rarely do I buy a CD after hearing just one song off the album. I usually have a 3 song rule; if I hear 3 songs &amp; like all of them, then I'll buy it. Late one night I couldn't sleep so I was watching MTV &amp; they showed his video for &quot;New York, New York&quot; and I loved the song. A couple days later I bought the album, but was concerned that I'd hate everything else. I couldn't have been more wrong. It is absolutely amazing. His voice, lyrics &amp; musicality are just supurb. It's few and far between that I'll buy an album and listen to it non-stop, and this is one of them. If he doesn't become a household name soon, then a lot of people will be missing out on talent that comes along so infrequently. With all the bubblegum crap that's out there he's a much needed breath of fresh air.
B00005N9CV|5.0|diana krall is filling the void left by the great singers who have gone.she has her own style,as an old timer i've seen all jazz singers,but diana is certainly one of the best,and i'm glad she sings all of standards
B00005QZWJ|5.0|Ladies and gentlemen, whether you're a fan of the Lord of the Rings or not, this is an excellent score.  Though I've not had the luxury of listening to other works by Mr. Shore, this is certainly a great way to begin the experience of delving into his repertoire.  The music here is, generally speaking, evocative of a fantasy that is quite unique to the world of Middle-Earth:  it is altogether magical, mystical, mysterious, intriguing, and yet noble, heroic, mighty, and exalting. The overall tone is one of urgency and darkness, and this is perfect for the story which is unfolding (&quot;The Ring's to be cast into Mount Doom.&quot;); it draws upon traditions in Celtic as well as Medieval and Rennaissance music.  <br />There is an extensive use of low-pitched string instruments, used to create a strong, well-paced murkiness and mellowness.  The varied use of percussion and brass adds a solidness and depth that also adds danger and darkness--even a grandness, as in the case of Track 11: The Ring Goes South with the brass (It is in that, in fact, that one first hears what I call the &quot;Fellowship Theme;&quot; in addition, one should note the wonderfully well-done mix of great enthusiasm of adventure with the foreboding darkness in this tracks opening.)  A very extensive use of drums in Track 13: The Bridge Of Khazad Dum is to be expected, for the orcs are coming with their war drums.  One particular wind instrument is used in solo (Is it the clarinet?) repeatedly in different tracks, and it plays such an ominous theme; it can be found in The Prophecy and Track 12: A Journey In The Dark, etc.  It's just a great theme to have repeated over and over again:  It can only be the &quot;Ring Theme.&quot;<br />The vocals are sensational and numerous (And the abundance of the lyrical mode is appropriate, as Tolkien placed a fantastic amount of emphasis and weight in the word, spoken or sung as well as written in the Lord of the Rings), done in a choral style, and they, too, dueto the manner in which they are done, are reminiscent of Orff's Carmina Burana (too, Williams' The Duel of the Fates), and so they invoke that tone poem's oh-so-ominous feeling of impending doom:  This works especially well for Tracks 1, 3, and 5 (The Prophecy, The Shadow of the Past, and The Black Rider), to name a few.  The opening track does an excellent job of pulling the listener into the rest of the soundtrack with its gothic feel that is produced by the perfect blend of choral and strings.  The elves' Lament for Gandalf is also a very, very nice touch within Track 14: Lothlorien; it is all at once eccelectic, ghostly (the words have an eery &quot;hollowness&quot; to them), and exotic, for it is strangely Arabic in style!<br />Notable exceptions to the overall darkness of this score are found in delightfully fun tunes as found in Tracks 2 and 6 (Concerning Hobbits, At the Sign Of The Prancing Pony).  They are quite the sort of music that I envisioned for the hobbits (for I do believe that the melodies in these tracks are undoubtedly the &quot;Hobbit Theme&quot;):  slightly jaunty and jocund, not too serious, and rather sophisticated.  Played with a recorder, it is marvelously done!<br />As for the Enya tracks, it can be said that I was apprehensive of them at first, as I am always of any contemporary who would attempt to record on the same CD as the rest of the score--they typically do not mix well.  However, I would say that Enya does an excellent job of interweaving her songs into the rest of the music, which one should have guessed as her musical style is quite Celtic to begin with.  A good example is that of Track 10's Aníron.<br />In short, there will be two camps of people:  those who don't want to see the movie and those who do.  Those who don't and buy this soundtrack will find themselves intrigued enough to want to see it just to listen to the music in action!  Those who already want to see it, will want to see it even more--in fact, they'll be dying to see it.  As for those folks who are already dying to see the movie, well...  here's your chance to get a taste of what's to come.  And since all music lovers know that one of any motion picture is in the score, one can only guess the Fellowship of the Ring will be far, far better than the soundtrack by itself.  Listening to it now, I am constantly getting goosebumps--but I would say that those goosebumps are only reserved for those who've read the books and know what the music is saying as it pertains to the story.  Right now, I'm hearing the next to last track, The Breaking of the Fellowship.  The Celtic airs rendered by the flute in this song are forlorn flying over the saddest, most sullen wave strings, for a great warrior has fallen, a member of the fellowship, after having already lost one at the Bridge of Khazad Dum.  Now the Fellowship is broken, but the mission is to be completed and so the journey must go on...<br />This is a must-buy.
B00000INEX|5.0|My daughter loved Baby Mozart and Baby Bach from the time she was 6 months to about 18 months.  Nothing else would hold her attention as long as one of these short but educational videos.  We normally wouldn't have let her watch a video as much as we let her watch these.  The music is pleasant (can't beat the classics!), the colors are enticing, the skits short enough to hold her attention, and always educational.  She learned many words based upon objects within this video series.<br />She did seem to lose interest in Baby Mozart and Baby Bach as she reached about 18 months and became more interested in the Dr. Dolittle World Animals and Neighborhood Animals.
B00005LLK8|4.0|Like &quot;The Full Monty,&quot; this film is a comic (but in no way belittling) treatment of hard times in a socially-challenged small town.  The accents are thick and some of the cultural references are a bit curious, but there's no denying the true heart pumping through the story.  <br />*** Billy Elliot is an 11-year-old boy who secretly ditches his boxing lessons for ballet class. His father and older brother are both participants in a bitter miner's strike gripping their town in northeastern England.  The whole family is also still in recovery-mode following the death of Billy's mother.<br />*** Billy's exuberance and talent (and actor Jamie Bell's) are such a joy to behold.  It makes it all the more poignant when he has to face his dad and brother's discovery of his dancing (as the audience knows they must).  Billy is the title hero here, but by the film's end, every character has made their own stunning contributions.
B000056K04|5.0|I love this CD almost as much as CRASH!!
B00005QIPH|3.0|Do you remember Elastica? How about Veruca Salt? How about Paw? All of these bands were hyped as the undeniable Thing That Would Save Rock and Roll. Show of hands: Who thinks that Paw saved rock and roll?<br />Unfortunately The Strokes are being yoked in the same fashion. Yes, this album is a pretty good album. But no way in H-E-double toothpicks does this band get this level of attention and hype if they're from the Midwest and their lead singer is not the son of the kingpin of the Elite modeling agency.<br />It's a pretty good album stocked with plenty of derivative work.
B000002WYT|5.0|Out of the 200+ CD's I own, This is my FAVORITE one of all time!!<BR>I listen to this CD every morning just to start my day off right. I love it!!
B000002O4S|2.0|This CD is no more than a couple of forgettable 80's songs, a fake Johnny B. Goode, 2 tracks by a band you've never heard of and ONLY 2 tracks of Alan Silvestri's score. The Back To The Future Theme by the Outatime Orchestra and the Back To The Future Overture. These are not actually direct tracks from the film either but arranged especially for the CD. Every single track from the score is missing and why Silvestri NEVER released, what is undoubtedly, his most popular score onto CD in it's entirety is beyond me. So far the fans have had to make do with bootleg versions but hopefully he will see to it that this and his original score for Predator make it to soundtrack CD sometime.
B00005RFAI|4.0|I liked Pink's first album well enough (not well enough to buy it), but didn't think that she would go the distance. What a shocker to hear this album. It is nothing short of amazing, quite a turnaround. I hope that people are able to embrace this for the great pop disc that it is. She comes across like Sheryl Crow in one song, then channels Klymaxx in the next. Many of the songs have a confessional quality and maturity that Britney couldn't even approach in all her panting about being a woman. Pink also has more importantly, a sense of humor. There are R &amp; B tinged dance tracks for sure, but even they are pop songs in the classic sense. After the death of Aaliyah, I felt that there was no hope on the pop landscape. This sophomore effort by Pink is full of promise. Only flaw I found was the end was a little ballad heavy. Bravo as well to producers Linda Perry ('What's Up&quot;, indeed!) and the very versatile Dallas Austin. Get this disc.
B00005RFQ5|5.0|I've been a Prince fan since 1982, and I have been in Paisley Park during the high times(Purple Rain) through the New Power Soul groove,including Rave. I could go on and on about him, but I'll keep it short. The last few releases by Prince have been good but not really up to par to what he's truly capable of. A lot of people blame Kirky J., but I think he was just chillin' out until all binding contracts with his signature on them had expired.(Not to mention that he and Mayte split up.) After some soul searching he's presents to the world, and to his Fams, The Rainbow Children.  This album has been ahot topic of discussion lately, some think it's great, some like the grooves but not the worlds, and there are some who never really give it a chance.  In my honest opinion, I absolutely love the album for three reasons. #1.Most music in this day and age,other than a few exceptions, is straight up boring and repetitive. With TRC Prince has once again proved that GREAT MUSIC isn't dead, only RADIO is. #2. Positiviy is sorely needed and missed even more especially with the events that happened on Sept.11, people now more than ever need something that will make them sit down and question their habits and their surroundings,hopefully for the better. #3. Spirituality and the quest to find your true reason for being is something that most of us go through at some point in our lives. I myself am trying to find my way, my destiny, my road back 2 God, it's in every one of us, but it's up 2 us 2 look for Heaven. Prince is no different,except it seems he is finally close 2 finding his PEACE(if he hasn't already)and you can hear it with ever note that is played on this CD. I just want 2 say Prince you have inspired me in more ways I can count,for so many years and I would like 2 say 2 things 2 you before I go. #1. Thank you with much love, from the bottom of my heart and #2. Welcome to the dawn.
B00005RIKD|5.0|Recorded on 9/11/01 &amp; dedicated to all of the lives lost on that day, Sting delivers new renditions of his classics with jazzy bass, world-beat rhythms, cellos and tender vocals. &quot;Fragile&quot; opens this 15 track set, and reeling in the events of that day, the words are heartfelt and wrought with meaning. &quot;Don't Stand So Close To Me&quot; gently glides into &quot;When We Dance&quot; and is hauntingly delivered with more warmth of feeling than ever before. Equally enjoyable are the reworks of &quot;Roxanne&quot; and &quot;If I Ever Lose My Faith In You&quot;. Even his latest work &quot;Brand New Day&quot; has a brand new sound. Sting's creative rearranging brings some surprising twists to familiar songs and makes one wonder while listening, &quot;why wasn't the song recorded like this originally?&quot;... they are that good! Listening to this cd is an experience and makes us realize (to quote Sting) &quot;how fragile we are&quot;.
0451169514|4.0|&quot;It&quot; was the first lengthy book in which I fully engaged, and is still one of the most frightening and enthralling books I've read.  More specifically, the first half of the book was absolutely terrifying.  I was completely absorbed and found myself constantly peering over my shoulder into the darkness as I read.  (Be warned:  &quot;Where The Wild Things Are&quot; was the &quot;scariest&quot; book I read prior to &quot;It.&quot;)<br />Unfortunately, the second half of the book seemed to &quot;sing for the sake of the song&quot; and in my opinion, was not on par with the former half.  Part of this is most likely due to my strong feelings for the first part, but probably also due to the excessive length of the plot.  I believe that if King could have left the ending more cryptic and not returned to &quot;kill&quot; the evil as an adult, he would have had a lengendary story with a cult-like following on his hands.  After all, the horror to the reader is making the connection between the characters and the children within ourselves.  I feel King loses this aspect by having the characters return as adults.  Rarely do we ever &quot;conquer&quot; fears from childhood - we just learn to deal with issues.  However, the second half is far from horrible - King just was so outstanding in the first half that it was just about impossible to write a closing to match.<br />As always, King is outstanding at verbalizing the obvious in ways most of us can only manage cerebrally.
B00005QZWI|5.0|Howard Shore was certainly a somewhat unconventional choice for the score of &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;. However, it has become obvious now that he was an excellent choice and that he was definitely up to the task.<br />There are many unconventional tracks on this soundtrack. One of the most unconventional pieces is probably &quot;The Bridge of Khazad-Dum&quot; where Shore uses a male choir to great effect, building the proper tension for this scene, which is most likely going to be a centerpiece of the movie. Another very interesting cut is &quot;Lothlorien&quot;, which has an &quot;arabian&quot; feel to it and which features haunting vocals in Quenya and Sindarin (two of Tolkien's invented languages) by Elizabeth Fraser. A favorite of mine is &quot;A Knife in the Dark&quot;, which jumps from dark choir voices and pounding percussion directly to the beautiful and innocent voice of young Edward Ross, an amazing musical moment which can send shivers down the listener's spine. Edward Ross' vocals fit just as well into &quot;The Breaking of the Fellowship&quot;, a mostly sad piece, setting the proper mood for the end of the movie.<br />Even with these somewhat uncommon tracks, the soundtrack is never overbearing, and there are many atmospheric pieces which are needed to set the proper tone for a movie without distracting from the actual movie events. There are several excellent re-occuring themes, which give the soundtrack a certain consistency without becoming boring.<br />Howard Shore also uses some celtic elements, especially on the light-hearted &quot;Concerning Hobbits&quot;. In other places, he uses elvish lyrics or has the choir relentlessly chant verses in the Black Speech for the darker scenes, thus drawing upon the great reservoir of Tolkien's world.<br />This soundtrack is of course being heavily promoted through Enya's appearance on two songs. &quot;May it Be&quot; is perhaps not Enya's most catchy tune, but it certainly shouldn't be catchy, as it isintended to be played over the movie credits just after the Breaking of the Fellowship, one of the saddest moments of the whole story. An uptempo tune a la &quot;Orinoco Flows&quot; would be out of place here. Enya's &quot;Aniron&quot;, which is weaved into &quot;The Council of Elrond&quot; is perhaps a bit more interesting and showcases Enya's otherworldly voice very well.<br />This is certainly a great score for anyone who likes good soundtracks which go a little bit beyond the usual &quot;soundtrack mainstream&quot;. Of course, it is also a must for any Tolkien fan, as it is obvious that the music, even as a stand-alone effort without the movie, is inspired by Tolkien's writings and mirrors their mood very well.
B000007MVX|4.0|This is a one-track album from a band with a mind that is far from one-track. You won't get confused as long as you remember to groove. I have never been able to completely understand the lyrics, but their imagery is rich and evocative of comic and cynical tragedy. The music veers from cleverly sublime to head-bangingly obnoxious. Very raw, and intentionally lacking the more streamlined flow of Thick as a Brick; reminds me of Frank Zappa, actually. One flaw: Ian should never have picked up that saxophone; he can play it well technically, but it's not his instrument and sounds like a soulless, computerized kazoo at his lips. Better versions of some of the sax-plagued tunes (complete with the much-preferred flute) can be found on the Chateau d'Isaster disc of Nightcap, a Tull CD released more recently. However, Nightcap lacks the completion of Passion Play. Get both!<br />Martin Barre's hackneyed northern accent in the Hare story is hillariously Pythonesque.
B000001ESP|5.0|I am a huge Rush fan. And I LOVE THIS CD!!!!!! I bought it for one reason...YYZ. And I love the whole thing. It's amazing. Those 3 guys really know how to put out good material. Also, I reccomend the triple-disc live CD. A MUST HAVE!
B00005RFAI|4.0|This cd is awesome! It a definite change from her first album, and in a good way. There's a little more rock, but theres still some dance songs. It's one of those cds where u can listen to the whole way through. I'd suggest u get it! u won't regret it!
B00003CXXJ|5.0|Shrek is absolutely hillarious - don't write it off as a silly &quot;kid's movie.&quot; Most kids won't even get the subtle (and not so subtle) humor employed in the movie to entertain adults. Shrek has it all - romance, fighting, humor and comedy - and it's something the whole family can watch together. And of course, the movie includes an important message for kids and adults alike.<br />If you get the DVD version of this movie you have to watch &quot;Shrek's karaoke party&quot; - when we first saw it, we were all cracking up non-stop!
B000059XVS|2.0|I won't comment on the cinematographic value of this movie as I don't think that I have anything to add to the reviews already posted. What I will say is that although this movie is truly a work of art, it is deeply flawed because of its dangerously false account of history. Generally speaking, for the most part the arab characters in the movie are made to appear simple, cruel, greedy, ie the usual treatment for arabs in Hollywood. But that isn't really what bothers me; the worst comes at the end of the movie, when the arab army headed by Lawrence reach Damascus. In the movie they are shown to argue for a total of two days after which they return to desert having achieved nothing. Supposedly they were unable to govern the city themselves, basically leaving the door open for France to move in with clean hands. <br />In reality however, the arab administration lasted not for two days but for two years. The nomads from the desert didn't try to run the city themselves - they were uneducated, but they weren't that stupid. They made use of the inhabitants of the city who had been running the place before and who did just as good a job under arab governance. The only reason they left the city was because they were forced to... by the French army. Hence the film didn't get it quite right, which is a problem and a great shame. I know it seems absurd, but maybe the best solution would be for this film to continue being shown and respected as much as it is, but for it to run a proviso at the beginning mentioning that its account of history is inaccurate, seeing as it purports to be a film based on actual historic events.
B00005QEO2|5.0|This cd has an awesome mix of Rarities, B-sides, Live stuff, and just plain old album stuff. If you wanna get to know more of the cleaned up Aerosmith then definately get this cd!!!! A lot of the rarites are really great tunes that you will like. The songs &quot;Can't Stop Messin&quot;, &quot;Don't Stop&quot;, &quot;Head First&quot; and &quot;Ain't Enough&quot; are really good ones. Oh, make sure you look at the pictures on the two discs, you should get a kick out of it! ^A^ ROCKS!!!!
B00005NWM3|4.0|My friend was talking to me in science and said his favorite band was Nicklback. I was ranting on about Duncan Sheik. I said&quot;Who is Nickleback?&quot; One day,I was surfin the net for lyrics and I found &quot;How you Remind Me&quot;. Thinking it was a misnamed Usher song, I clicked. I found one of the best rock songs ever. I'm a die-hard N'Sync fan, but this is such an appealing album that  couldn't be passed it up. Thank you Wes(friend)  and Nickleback! Buy this CD! Even if you hate rock, this album will open your eyes to the wonderful world that is Nickleback!
B00003CXXJ|5.0|Consider this: a movie which is enjoyable for children but also contains humor suited for adults.  Shrek flies over these borders with an excellent plot, good character development, and outrageosly funny laughs.  The music surrounding the film is top notch and the creativity is phenomenol!
B00005NWM3|1.0|You've heard it before, I gurantee it.  Granted, by a different band name, but don't be fooled, Nickelback is just as bad, if not worse than most bands on the radio at the current moment.  <br />Sure, the single is catchy... but it's not enough to warrant the purchase of the cd. <br />Do yourself a favor, and save your 14 bucks.  Treat yourself to something not so, corporate...
0792156684|5.0|I can't believe all the negative reviews about this movie because it didn't depict the true story 100%. If you wanted to see a documentary then go get that!!!<BR>This movie opened the  eyes to many younger generation people who really had no idea about the Titanic and all the people that died. I first saw it in an IMAX theater and you better believe it felt real! Sure the love story depicted in the movie was an added bonus but can any of us say that there weren't people in love on that ship (I'm sure there were several love stories taking place!) So someone actually used their imagination and made up a love story so the movie would be something both tragic and  beautiful.
B00005QK3W|4.0|It amazes me how so many people give this CD either &quot;5 Stars&quot; or &quot;1 Star&quot;. This is not the perfect &quot;classic&quot; CD but it is far from being a &quot;1&quot;.

Overall it is a worthy effort from this musical legend.<br />On a CD that boasts 16 songs, I think we should almost feel like we are getting a 2 CD set for the price of one...<br />Keep up the good work Paul and here's hopeing you tour again someday soon!
B00003CXXJ|1.0|(Reviewer is 25 y.o.)<br />I didn't get a chance to see this in the theatres, so I breathlessly awaited the DVD release... What a lot of wasted anticipation!<br />The animation is the only thing this film has going for it.  Some scenes are absolutely gorgeous...The sunflowers are real enough to touch...The dragon is too cute...The castle is awesome...<br />But the animation is where my enchantment began and ended with this film.  I will admit, sometimes my sense of humour tends towards the obscure, the esoteric, the high brow...But I'm not totally stuffy...I do think there is a time and a place for some good old fashioned pub type humour...I even laugh at the Drew Carey show from time to time...and how much more low brow could you get?  ... But this movie was neither the time nor the place for such humour... It was painfully self-aware, forced, crass, rude, and just flat out tasteless.<br />The scenes I found the most tasteless and disturbing are:  The princess goes out early one morning to find food.  As she walks along, she begins to hum a lovely little melody...In Disney fashion a sweet little blue bird begins to warble along with her...the shot pans back and forth between the Princess and the bird a couple of times, and then focuses on the Princess as she hits a high note...a high note she can't sustain and that goes all wrong...you hear this gruesome exploding sound and no more singing bird...the shot then focuses back on the branch where the bird was...only now, there are two little burnt legs clutching the branch and a rising plume of smoke...  Please!  That is just disturbed...<br />The other scene that upset me involves the Princess and Shrek using a live toad and a snake to make balloon animals...I know a lot of people will think I am uptight, so be it...but stuff like this just flat out warps kids.  No matter how harmless they think it is...<br />Don't even get me started on the music!<br />Anyway, suffice to say, this movie was a total waste of money and time.  If your an animation afficianado, then do see the movie..but if you are looking for some healthy, happy, and fun entertainment for yourself or your kids, pass this one up completely...<br />(The one thing besides the animation that this DVD has going for it, is the preview of the upcoming Dreamworks animated feature _Stallion, Cinmarron Spirit of the West_.... the animation is unbelieavably gorgeous and the story looks flat out awesome...)...time.

B00005QK3W|2.0|A surprisingly weak effort from the usually reliable Paul, sounding more like a collection of very mild B-sides than anything else. Too much of Paul using his sloppy &quot;rocker&quot; singing voice. Too many trite lyrics. You might think Linda's passing would have inspired Paul to write songs of actual substance, but you'd be wrong.
6304341849|5.0|This is the one of the most faithful novel-to-film adaptations that I have seen. American director James Ivory has a wonderfully British sensibility, and the movie vividly recreates late Edwardian England in muted autumnal colours. In particular, it gives the 21st century viewer a very real appreciation of what it must have been like to be gay in such a society.<br />The cast is uniformly excellent. James Wilby was not Ivory's first choice for the central role of upper-class Maurice (Daniel Day Lewis and Julian Sands were earlier contenders), but he gives an outstanding and totally plausible portrayal. Equally good is Hugh Grant, years before he found fame as the archetypal British twit. Grant's role is a difficult one; he must at first engage our sympathy and fondness, then gradually lose our respect as he seeks to enter &quot;respectable&quot; society. Ultimately, we come to despise his cowardice. Grant achieves all of this without descending into caricature - a considerable feat.<br />Rupert Graves makes a fine Alex Scudder, the lusty undergamekeeper who seduces and transforms Maurice. Apart from a slightly inconsistent accent, he, too. seems entirely plausible and fans of DH Lawrence's Lady Chatterley's Lover should note that this full-blooded lad pre-dates Lawrence's own gamekeeper by many years!<br />An outstanding supporting cast of seasoned pros includes the late, great Denholm Elliot and Ben Kingsley in small, but pivotal roles as, respectively, a bullying doctor and a hypnotist, both of whom Maurice unsuccessfully seeks help from.<br />This movie has a superb period atmosphere, a leisurely but rewarding pace, plenty of understated passion, memorable music and great script-writing. Kudos to the scenarists for being so faithful to the spirit of Forster, while at the same time adding scenes to remind viewers of the real dangers for gay men in Edwardian England.<br />Outstanding.
B0000584V3|5.0|What more can I say that has not already been said about this album?  It is pure genius.  This album is a definite must for any true metal fan who really appreciates diversity, great musicianship (especially on the part of Mikael Akerfeldt) progressive and melodic playing and a good blend of hard and soft passages.  Opeth is unlike any other band and believe me, after you listen to their music, you will be hooked like everyone else.  This band has it all.  You will find yourself buying all of their albums after this one.
B000021YQV|5.0|This second album of SOD is really awesome. I got it a few days ago and i can't have enough of it. After the self titled debut, the band manages to bring on the goodies again, with a truly awesome masterpiece. Toxicity is great in all aspects, a perfect proof that the band has grown up alot since their debut.<BR>Serj has the same way of singing, so different and strange, yet so awesome, but his voice has progressed and now it sounds much better. Also all the songs are more complex, well written and different than those on the first album. There are so many time changes it'll make you dizzy. One second it's heavy and screaming, the other second... back to a ballad. The lyrics are also better than on the first.<br />The album starts with Prison Song, a great opener about the US prison system. Great song.<br />Surprisingly, the next few songs don't have the spark that characterizes the whole album. Well maybe except Jet Pilot. When i first listened to this album, after Prison Song, i was kind of disappointed, because Needles, Deer Dance, X, and even Jet Pilot, don't have the originality of what i used to know about the band from their first CD. <br />But i had no idea what was expecting me....<br />Starting with Chop Suey, it all changes. This is the SOD i love so much. Chop Suey is well known, there's no point in describing it. And after the short Bounce, come the great songs of the album: Forest is surprisingly haunting, and ATWA is simply brilliant. Unlike Chop Suey (a metal song with ballad passages), this is a ballad with metal passages... and it sounds teriffic. Shimmy and Science are really good, and then comes Psycho, another masterpiece. It all ends with Aerial which finishes with a pretty strange passage -- you'll see what i am talking about once you buy this album ----- well go on! buy it!!
B00005R2M3|4.0|In a world full of cheesy Latin pop divas, Shakira stands above the crowd with true talent and ambition. In an age when the music industry feeds you bland pop with a few extra horns and percussion instruments and calls it &quot;Latin,&quot; Shakira creates true South American sounds with a flawless integration of rock, pop, and other international flavors. Her outstanding previous album, MTV Unplugged, made Shakira my favorite Latin artist, but I was very worried about this new album after that god-awful Pepsi commercial of hers that's been playing lately. Thank heavens she doesn't really sound as manufactured as that commercial. This album shows the full range of Shakira's songwriting talents. &quot;Objection (Tango),&quot; which appears again in Spanish at the end of the album, makes use of authentic Argentine folk rhythms. &quot;Rules&quot; and &quot;Te Dejo Madrid&quot; are clearly inspired by 70s and 80s American rock, with winning results. &quot;Ready for the Good Times&quot; even dabbles in disco, but is still completely believable. One previously released track, the awesome Middle-Eastern flavored &quot;Ojos Asi&quot; is remade here in English as &quot;Eyes Like Yours,&quot; and this song is a minor masterpiece. Just don't listen to Gloria Estefan's unnecessarily complex translated lyrics in this one, like the bizarre line &quot;crossed a river of salt, just after I rode a ship that sunk in the desert.&quot;<br />Alas, Shakira is trying just a little too hard on this album, which she has tailored as an English debut to storm the American market. With her lyrics, she either needs to get a little better at English, or she has exercised extreme poetic license. Some examples are lines like &quot;my world was full of seven legged cats&quot; (&quot;Ready for the Good Times&quot;) or &quot;feed your empty brain with your hydroponic pot&quot; (&quot;Poem to a Horse&quot;). These dense lyrics, along with the back cover's proclamation &quot;The Entire Album Produced By Shakira&quot; are unnecessary grabs for significance. Shakira's natural talents can carry the day just fine. In the singing department, Shakira has forgotten some of her natural subtlety that made her earlier work so endearing. Some critics noted that her voice sounds a little like Alanis Morrisette's, so now Shakira is mistakenly trying to push that similarity, leading to some very awkward and forced vocal moments. This is completely unnecessary and a waste of her excellent natural skills. And I'm going to have to object to the physical image being pushed with this album. Shakira is a very attractive woman, but why is she forcing this new sex kitten look on us? Whatever manager told her that she should look like the Colombian Britney Spears should be fired immediately. Obviously, Shakira likes to frequently reinvent her image. I hope she reinvents it again, and fast.y Shakira&quot; are unnecessary grabs for significance. Shakira's natural talents can carry the day just fine.

B00000K0DT|5.0|This is a twist on the WhoDunIt plot with powerful performances by everyone but Spacey in particular. I love this movie and watch it over and over even though I know the plot and the ending. If you like good mysteries or Spacey movies, definetely get this movie.
630169399X|5.0|This 1984 behind the scenes look at Bernstein's first recording of his classic score, West Side Story, is a real treat. The singers he assembled were an eclectic mix: Kiri Te Kanawa, Tatiana Troyanos and Jose Carreras, among others. The latter may have seemed an odd choice for the role of Tony, but vocally this character has never been better interpreted. Less successful is Te Kanawa, who overdoes her Puerto Rican accent, ignoring Bernstein's plea for &quot;the merest hint of Puerto Rican-ness&quot;.<br />The video takes the viewer through preliminary rehearsals in Bernstein's apartment, interviews with the singers and Bernstein, and finally the recording studio. More than anything else, it conveys the joys and frustrations of making a recording with the composer himself conducting, and the programme does not shrink from showing temper tantrums from both Bernstein and Carreras (who storms out of the studio at one point, cursing &quot;Ma porco in Dio!&quot;)<br />Bernstein's energy, creativity, anguish and love of life are evident in every scene, and this is often a moving study of a towering musical figure.<br />Among the singers Jose Carreras steals the show, singing the demanding &quot;Maria&quot; in a performance that is both poetic and powerful. He sings a magnificent High B flat on the word &quot;MAria!&quot; and then ends the song on a melting falsetto. This is the Carreras of yore, and he is unforgettable.<br />Forget the off-key singing in the movie version of this classic - this is the real thing, with the maestro himself in charge.
B00005RFQ5|5.0|Let's face it.  Prince is the most creative artist of all time.  He never ceases to amaze me.  I never criticize music of any kind, because I am not a musician.  In my opinion, NO ONE has any right to criticize someone's else's work.  However, I couldn't help it with this release!  This is the most funky, creative, and touching album Prince has EVER released!  The entire album is one HUGE trip!  It is also the most spiritual album he has ever released, and for this, I truly adore the whole concept of the album.  Prince is really sending out a positive message on this album, and EVERY song screams it!  Prince has NEVER dissapointed me with any of his work, anyway.
B000007T1M|4.0|Being the first album of a new band, this self titled CD is a very good efort. The &quot;problem&quot; is i got it only a week before i bought Toxicity and now i can't seem to be able to listen to anything but the new one.....<BR>anyways some thoughts: if you manage to like the way Serj sings, you'll love this. The album has really good songs, e.g. Spiders, but it gets really tiring once you've listened to 7-8 songs. But as i said, considering it's their first, this is really good.
6303471501|1.0|If U have seen this brilliant film before with the original Australian soundtrack, then I do not recommend this video! Only in America will they take a film in perfectly acceptable English, and then go and totally ruin it, by dubbing it into American English. The mind just boggles! The initial reaction is one of disbelief when you first hear one of the characters speak (because U know what he's supposed to sound like). This soon turns into irritation as you try to marry the characters with the new 'foreign' voices, and try to spot dubbing errors (lips moving but no sound &amp; vice versa),and deliberate substitution of words (there R some of these as well), AND, try to watch the story, for the rest of the film.<br />I knew there was a dubbed version, but i thought it was called 'Road Warrior' or something.<br />The sad thing is, for me to return it will cost more than the video is worth (had i only been informed in the synopsis)<br />I shall search for a 2nd hand 'original' copy in England.<br />Please tell us when a film, in English, has been dubbed for the American market.<br />If you have not seen it before, or if U R American &amp; can't follow the Ozzy slang anyway, then i suppose this dubbed version can be entertaining, but not to me.<br />I shall be much more wary in future.<br />If it ain't broken, don't fix it!!
B00005ASHM|5.0|Much has already been written about this masterpiece, one of the greatest LPs in the history of pop/rock. Two things about it, in particular, that I appreciate: one is that it demonstrates what imaginative studio production can be capable of - so many records today, by contrast, are overproduced, or simply badly produced, that they sound immediately stale; this, by contrast, sounds as fresh as the day it came out. The other thing about Pet Sounds that I love is that it, while not &quot;soul&quot; music per se, is a record with much personality and soul, and shows the value of introspection when one is a musical genius like Brian Wilson, the man who is mostly responsible for this.
B00005LB9O|4.0|Rolling Stone slightly discounts this cd for two reasons: not departing from their &quot;The Man Who&quot; sound; these songs are likely to not receive much airtime in the States.  Just because A&amp;R in this country can't recognize when it hears a good album shouldn't detract one from thoroughly enjoying this album.<br />Sing gets the album off to a great start.  A plea to his fiancee to find comfort in their love &amp; lose her inhibitions (Baby, there's something going on today/ I say nothing/ For the love you bring won't mean a thing/Unless you sing), Fran belts out in this banjo driven ballad that will get airtime this summer.<br />Lyrically, the album picks up where &quot;The Man Who&quot; left off.  Side discusses the difficulties in being pessimistic &amp; offers a plea for self-acceptance (The grass is always greener on the other side/Neighbor's got a car that you want to drive/The circle only has one side).  Flowers in the Window.  He finds himself in love &amp; at a place in his life where life is full and the season warm.  You'll be hearing both on the radio this summer.  <br />Not to be forgotten is the 14:00 minute long track to close the album.  You Don't Know What I'm Like is nothing more than a novelty song, but The Humpty Dumpty Love Song and Ring Out the Bells serve as a solid closure to their junior effort.<br />The blokes have done it again.  Another cd you won't need to use the track skip button.  Don't wait for the radio to introduce you.  Get this now.
B00004T9UF|5.0|i have always been an eminem fan, but i just recently got the cd. this dude is totaly awesome! now, i like a mix of music, from staind and disturbed to dr.dre and nelly. but eminem has to be the ultimate rapper. and u know what? HE A HOTTIE TOO!  so buy this cd today, cuz its a pile of junk that u gonna love
B000002KBU|5.0|Each of these songs are amazingly crafted and essentially emotional. However together they make perhaps the best folk album of all time. Mitchell's voice and lyrics combined with the melancholy instrumentals make for an incredible collection. A must have.
B00005RFAI|5.0|When an artist decides to make an album that they want to make, it's a great thing. Pink (aka Alicia Moore) finally drops the fake R&amp;B act and reveals herself on MISSUNDAZTOOD. Her voice is raw and gritty, more than usual. Musically it's still pop but with a more rock edge. Pink co-wrote many of the songs on MISSUNDAZTOOD along with Linda Perry. Lyrically MISSUNDAZTOOD sways between the bubbley (&quot;get the party started&quot;) and the personal (&quot;family portrait&quot;). Another confession comes up on &quot;don't let me get me&quot; -- which she says &quot;tired of being compared/to damn britney spears&quot;/. The bluesy rock duet &quot;misery&quot;, which features Steven Tyler is very well done. The current hit &quot;get the party started&quot; is awesome. It instantly puts you on the dance floor. Alothough MISSUNDAZTOOD is personal it still packs in the grooves. Pink is comfortable and honest which makes MISSUNDAZTOOD better than CAN'T TAKE ME HOME. She's grown and it shows.
B00005RFQ5|5.0|Although I am not a religious person, and this CD has serious religious overtones, I listen to it a little like I would read a fantasy story.  Prince's ideas of a utopian society based on god sound nice, but they are also unlikely.<br />That aside, Prince puts together an absolutely stunning album, displaying exceptional jazz, funk, R&amp;B, and rock skills, while introducing some new and innovative sounds of his own.  John Blackwell contributes perfectly with his amazing drum skills, making up for some less than stellar drum programming which has been appearing on his more recent albums.  <br />All in all, this album is a complete success, one which MUST be listened to as a whole.  This isn't a CD that you would want to put on random play in your 6 Disc, this is one you want to listen to fully.<br />For optimum results, listen to it on a high quality stereo or in headphones, free of distractions, in one complete sitting.
B00005OWEG|4.0|For me, &quot;Apocalypse Now&quot; was always more about the journey and not so much about the destination.  With the release of &quot;Apocalypse Now Redux&quot; on DVD, my opinion hasn't changed.  The added scenes of &quot;Redux&quot; give more depth to Captain Williard's journey, but the destination, i.e., the termination of Colonel Kurtz &quot;with extreme prejudice&quot; still is somewhat of a let down.  Dennis Hopper's babbling photojournalist character seems even more ridiculous and annoying today than he did 20 plus years ago.  And, in my humble opinion, Brando's performance is way overrated.  Still, the whole is greater than the sum of the parts and, for that reason, &quot;Apocalypse Now Redux&quot; gets my four stars.<br />The DVD presentation is an entirely different story, however; Paramount really blew it with this release.  Yes, they have given us the additional 49 minutes of restored footage that is &quot;Redux,&quot; but there are absolutely no extras save the &quot;Redux&quot; trailer.  No director's/actor's commentary.  No &quot;behind the scenes&quot; footage.  No biographies of Francis Ford Coppola or any of the principal actors.  No production notes.  Nada.  Nothing.  Come on, Paramount, that's what DVD is all about, especially for a film like &quot;Apocalypse Now Redux.&quot;  One star (and a raspberry) for the cheapskates at Paramount.

0671042858|5.0|In my opinion to be one of Kings best. Scary and fast. You won't be disipointed. If you don't like the monstrous King novels this is a great one to start with and make your way up. Yes, there is baseball but the story is mostly about a young girl lost in the woods with a horrific evil following her and leaving clawed trees and dead animals in her path.
B00004W5UA|2.0|I like Mr. Pitt, but sorry I fell asleep during the movie - too much violence for me.
B00005QZWJ|5.0|It is *wonderful*, simply one of the best OSD I ever heard. Howard Shore's sensibility has known how to handle the spirit of the book through the images of the movie and drives us to Middle-Earth, from The Shire to Amon Hen. I'm delighted, indeed.
B00005RFQ5|5.0|Awesome album!  Here it is, short and sweet...The Rainbow Children Starts out smooth and jazzy, then you find yourself in some beautiful music and you end with some of that funky guitar stuff that we love from Prince.  I'll be honest, this is a concept album and it takes a few listenings.  By the 2nd or 3rd time, you realize how perfect and layered the songs are.  I don't no if there are any singles from the TRC but some of my favorites are 1+1+1is3, She Loves me 4 me, Last december, The Everlasting Now, Family Name...Oh what the hell, it should be treated as a whole and the whole is Great!
B00005JY1B|4.0|maybe 5 stars, but before I saw the movie a stupid magazine wrote how it ended. So not cool! <BR>Great acting by Keanu reeves! And don't listen to the bad reviews in magazines, because everybody has his own opinion. If you don't like romantic movies, don't buy this one
B00003CXXJ|5.0|If there were ever a movie to see and to own, Shrek was it. Okay, maybe it's not the only one, but it's definitely worth having. The movie has got to be one of the funniest, smartest satyres to be produced in the last 100 years. With Shrek, you get to take everything you thought you knew about fairy tales and see them from the other side. The movie puts fairy tale living in a new light and challenges the viewer to see things through childlike eyes. It's like being a kid all over again. One of the best things about this movie is that it's great for kids and adults. Kids will love the general story and the animation. Adults will love the underlying messages and humor as well as the animation. And, you've got to see the extras on DVD...Trust me.
B00005NWM3|4.0|I've had this CD for about 3 weeks, and so far it hasn't come out of my CD player yet.  There are some songs on there, that aren't as good as others, but most of them are great!  Never Again is a very good song, not top notch, but the lyrics are outstanding, and make up for anything it lacks.  How You Remind me, everyone has heard it, very good song, it gets old though.  Too Bad is an outstanding song, it sounds very good, one of the best on this CD.  Where Do I Hide is my second favorite song on this CD, very good guitar work, good lyrics, and just a plain fun song. I haven't heard very many people talking about the song Good Times Gone...this is the best song I've heard in a while by any band...the first time I listened to it I got chills.  I love this song!!!  The slide guitar is really what makes this song work!<br />Basically, if you like this style of music, GO FOR IT.  It's not as clean cut as Staind, and it's probably not one I'll listen to for tons of time like Staind, but it's a very good CD by a very good band!
B00005RFQ5|5.0|Again Prince reigns, he has come full circle with this masterpiece.  I have been a Prince fam since his first album and he has taken me on many a journey and the experiences have been great.  This album take you higher, it enlightens and you will be uplifted.  Sit back, open your mind and enjoy the ride and U can be 100% sure this is the ride divine.  Wonderful, magnificent, bravo..bravo.
B00005O5JV|5.0|I totally love this movie! I wasn't really expecting much when I went to the theater to see it but I loved it so much that I saw three times. Reese Witherspoon is absoulutely adorable as Elle Woods. She truly gives an excellent performance. This movie suceeds on so many levels! With all the humor and the uplifting message you can't help but love this movie!
B0000020T3|5.0|I have heard the song &quot;Shake Some Action&quot; some 5,000 times since 1977, and from the opening notes, and from the moment those first, dark, pulsing notes ring out, the same thing happens: The world stands still, reality drops away, and I am enveloped in a total shivering, dark, throbbing universe of thrill, memory and obsession. Not only is this song one of the greatest pop recordings ever, it is one of the most striking works of art ever created. Absolute perfection. Nothing else on the album is quite as good as the song &quot;Shake Some Action&quot; (whose first five seconds alone are towering, monumental), but very little in all of human creative endeavor quite matches it.
0446677450|4.0|Rich Dad, Poor Dad (RDPD) is one book that you have to read it to believe it. I ignored it at first, but now kicked myself for not picking it up earlier. I found the stories of little Bob and Mike boring too, but the punchlines were definitely worth a thought. Basically, if you are looking for a quick-fix, try howcanigetrichquick.com. This book just confirmed two things for me. One, learn to sell (hence read &quot;How to become a Rainmaker&quot;). Bob's encounter with the Singapore reporter is something very common here in this sunny side of town. Everyone here think they are a professional and their skills are worth a million bucks. Well, good luck. (email me if you don't agree) Two, be too quick to judge and you'll be sorry. A view that you held so strong can never be the best, unless its tried and tested. Even then... But unless you hear another side of it, you have no comparison to begin with, so what's with the arrogance? Hence, almost everyone I spoke to about RDPD laughed at me for being gullible. Well, but they are the one who has not done it before, or didn't know how to do it. Let me go ask someone who has done it and email me if you want to know the results.
0792151712|5.0|Titanic I would have to say was the best film I have ever seen. It had great acting by Kate Winslet as Rose Dewitt Bukater, Billy Zane as Cal Hockley, and of course Leonardo DiCaprio as Jack Dawson. The other actor's/ actress's were great as well. The script/ dialouge was great I loved it. It was just the best film I've ever seen. If you love drama's/romance's thoose type's of films you will defently love Titanic. Rose and Jack have fallin in love, but Cal does not appove of this and want's to take Jack out of the picture. Jack and Rose's love is soo strong that neither of them are going to be apart until the ship docks. There love will be tested when the ship has hit an iceberg and Titanic will sink. Of course Jack and Rose will stick together through thick an thin to be with each other. They both have been in the ocean for a while because Rose decides not to go in a lifeboat. After minutes or hours have passed Jack has died and Rose will go on  with her life as she promised Jack that she will survive and she does. Titanic is a sad, but happy movie over all. I really loved Titanic and will keep enjoying it. James Cameron I have to say he did an excellent job in directing this movie. It's the best movie I have to say he ever did so far. It's so great that I have been watching it a million times. I will keep doing so. I bet that you will love it as well as I did and many other's.

B00000K2VZ|5.0|&quot;Pearl&quot; is one of my top ten albums of all time.I've never heard a voice like Janis.Its like 12 different vocals coming at you at the same time.The women never came close to her peek,and she still stands alone after all these years.The hits well know,&quot;Cry Baby,&quot;and the Masterpiece,Kris Kristofferson's,&quot;Bobby McGee,are unreal,but my favorite number is &quot;Half Moon.&quot;This cut could be a hit today. &quot;Get it while you can,&quot; reminds me of what were going through now after 9-11-01.&quot;Move Over,&quot; the opening song, is so different.Janis has a duet with the guitar.It sounds so fresh,well produced,and one of the best rock and roll cuts from this legend. I can't think of one song on the CD thats a filler except for the instrumental,&quot;Buried alive in the Blues.&quot; Janis was suppose to place her vocals on the cut,but died before the recording session.If you are into Classic Rock and Roll,you have to get &quot;Pearl&quot; for your record collection
B00005RFAI|4.0|Hoping Pink would continue her strong reign in the music world with her second albume, so is not to be missundaztood anymore as these tracks ROCK!<br />A wide variety of tracks from pop, dance, rap to jazz.  This is going straight to the top and I can foresee at least 4-5 top 10 hits off the track - easy.<br />Way to go Pinky.......
B000002J09|4.0|This marks the end of the \\"numbered\\" albums. This isn't their best, but it sure is a good album.<br />1.Black Dog-The call-and-response thing still kicks (...) every time I hear it. Fleetwood Mac has done it, Judas Priest did it, and Nazareth did it, but Led Zeppelin is the best with the call and response. Good guitar tone for the solo. 5/5<br />2.Rock and roll-Good straightforward blues rock. Excellent singing from Plant. The drumming has been mocked so many times by other bands it hurts. 5/5<br />3.Battle Of Evermore-Sandy Denny's on this? For those of you who don't know her, she's in the great rock band Fairport Convention, which makes excellent folk songs. This is another song based on Tolkien's work. Beatiful lyrics. 5/5<br />4.Stairway To Heaven-Yeah, I know, i'm supposed to love this song and all the epic stuff they did on it and the fantastic solo, blah blah blah. Well, excuse me, but i think it's overrated. I know that a lot of Led Zeppelin fans and rock fans who are reading this will have high pressure boiling points and instantly click the non-helpful buttons, but that's whjat I think. hey have much better songs that are 8 minutes. Achilles Last Stand, for example. This is good, and I'm glad it got them hailed and stuff, but I think it's overrated. Thank you for your time. 4/5<br />5.Misty Mountain Hop-Yawn. Not all that great. Weird lyrics though. Not very memroable. 2.5/5<br />6.Four Sticks-Ah, back to quality. This is a very good song with a good 5/4 beat. John Bonham played with 4 sticks, that's how the name got started. Nice usage of the acoustic guitar. 5/5<br />7.Going To California-Should've been on III. Very good mandolin playing. I like the lyrics. 5/5<br />8.When The Levee Breaks-Really good slow blusesy number. Great harmonica playing form Plant. Drums galore. Excellent album ender. 5/5<br />Good album, and it should be your first pick. Bye.
0553106635|5.0|Perhaps it's because everything is so intricately detailed?  I don't know, but I do know that it's going to be very hard to wait until August, 2002 to read the next book in this series.  It is a truly wonderful series, and this book continues that tradition, ratcheting up the suspense and the intrigue to a level that's almost hard to take.<br />In this series, there are no *true* heroes.  Everybody's flawed in some ways, they do nasty things to their enemies.  They even sometimes, out of necessity, do nasty things to their friends.  Even the truly evil characters end up having some redeeming characteristics.  It doesn't make them any less likable, but it does make them a lot more human.<br />The characters are spread all over the world, even more so in this book then in the previous ones.  There are so many plotlines to follow that it can sometimes be confusing.  But if you work at it a little bit, it's not that hard.  Each chapter is told in a different character's point of view.  Some characters never have their view told, and we only see them through the eyes of others.  We never see Robb's point of view, but we see him through Catelyn's eyes, for example.<br />In this book, we get our first look at Jaime Lannister.  Through the first two books, he appears mostly as a scumbag.  But Martin shows that he does have a sense of honour, even though it is a bit warped.  It provided a very interesting contrast from the first two books.<br />Another hallmark of this series is that you can never tell what's going to happen.  Just because a character is one of the &quot;main&quot; characters, doesn't mean that character will survive the book.  Martin has no qualms about killing off his major characters.  It makes a refreshing change.<br />Finally, throughout the first three books, magic of a sorts is slowly making its way back into the world.  The series starts out as more medieval then fantasy, but it's going to be moving a bit more toward the fantastic.<br />This series (and this book) is the perfect cure for the person who thinks that fantasy has become old hat.  Do yourself a favour and pick it up.  Martin has promised it will only be 6 books, so you don't even need to worry about that like you do about Robert Jordan.and this book) is the perfect cure for the person who thinks that fantasy has become old hat.

B00005OM4N|3.0|Like a lot of fans I like Britney Spears.  However, I don't think this CD proved how talented of a singer she is, nor did it represent her \\"maturity\\" as an artist.  Her songs are catchy and that's what the public today wants.  I think she has the ability to perform and entertain, but her voice has not developed into a great singer.  Her voice has a tendency to sound very nasal, which you end up hearing the same type of songs because her voice can only do so much. I am not trying to totally bash on Britney, because out of very few of my friends I like her, but as far as her new CD goes, she has not matured as a singer or as a songwriter.
B00005OM4N|3.0|Not Brits best cd.That would be Oops.Many of the songs sound like Janet Jackson rip offs.I think she ruined &quot;I Love Rock n Roll&quot;.If Joan Jett were dead she would be rolling over in her grave.Exept for Im a Slave 4 U all the songs sound like the same ones from Oops...i did it again.Its a shame to.This could have been an exellent cd.Sounds like the same old teen pop that everyone else is doing.If Britney wants to last longer she needs to find some new producers and songwriters.
B00005RFQ5|5.0|Wow.  Prince is truly an odd man.  Odd, but brilliant.  This album features him stretching like he has never stretched before.  We hear tracks of intense funkiness, and one mad guitar solo on the opening track.  At other times, we get almost ambient techno, at others just sheer oddity.  It's a fitful listen, but well worth it.  You will be grinning once again at what this man is capable of.
6305364613|5.0|From start to finish this is a fast paced musically driven manic version of the greatest love story ever told.  Set in modern day Verona beach in Miami it sizzles along with the sunshine and pulls the watcher into the inevitble ending.  Director Bas LLurman jumps from one scene to another with no breathing space in between. The finale is done as the original idea was intended, so that Romeo dies in Juliets arms.  If you don't buy this then you obviously do not no good movies.
B00005RFQ5|5.0|I just have to say that this is the album that I've been waiting for!  It has everything!  A very introspective Prince on a mostly mellow, very cool album with a serious Jazz flavor.  Slow and Deep grooves.  Prince has reached a new level of personal reconciliation.  In the same vein as &quot;Purple Rain&quot;, but older, cooler, and more mature.  YOU WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED!  Hopefully, this is the new Prince.  For sure, I'd like to hear a whole lot more of this.

B00005QIPH|3.0|I really like the music, but I wish Iggy Pop still made music like this. He invented the sound and it bugs me that I have to listen to The Strokes album to get my fix of &quot;that classic Iggy and the Stooges sound&quot;.<br />Mabey I'm just getting too old, but I still love the artists that start the trends rather than the ones that just bring it to a younger audience.<br />Another thing - I bet when concert ticket go on sale you can see Iggy for half the price that you would spend to see these wannabee's.

078322804X|5.0|Movies made from Saturday Night Live material rarely succeed at expanding the characters into figures that are capable of holding down a feature length film.  By drawing on the rich tradition of the blues, \\"The Blues Brothers\\" not only succeeds but excels.  Dan Ackroyd and John Belushi are Elwood and Joliet Jake Blues, two brothers who hit the road to reassemble their old blues band and raise enough money to save the orphanage where they were raised.  The musical sequences, performed by Ackroyd, Belushi, and a stellar cast of blues legends, explode with energy.  It is clear that everyone involved with this project has a great love of this music; the result is an irresistable film./
B000002UR7|2.0|I'm one of those who think that although Pablo Honey is a decent album in its own right, it is decidely inferior to Radiohead's other albums.  That having been said, I would definitely recommend Pablo Honey to anyone who already enjoys Radiohead's music because it does give you a good sense of how the band started out and how far they've come since then.  I'll just hit a few highlights of the album:<BR>   1. Although &quot;Creep&quot; was overplayed into the ground back in '93 and I hated it back then, I have to admit now that it's actually a great tune, with Jonny's wonderfully abrasive guitar slashing merry hell out of the chorus (come to think of it, Jonny's wonderfully abrasive guitar slashes merry hell out of several Radiohead songs!).<BR>   2. &quot;Anyone Can Play Guitar&quot;!  Yeah, the lyrics are kinda cheesy, but this song rocks with monstrous feedback, blirps, and squiggles courtesy of Messrs. Greenwood and O'Brien.  One of the more creative tracks on the album.<BR>   3. &quot;Ripcord&quot;- this song just rocks.  Starts out with a catchy, pretty little riff, then degenerates into disonance in the chorus that still manages to be, well, catchy.<BR>   4. &quot;Blow Out&quot;- this is easily the most mature offering on Pablo Honey, and my favorite track.  Cool, semi-jazzy, and then exploding into spaced-out mania at the end.  Lyrically and musically, this one has the classic amazing Radiohead vibe to it more than any other song on the album.  It's no surprise then, that this is reported to be Jonny Greenwood's favorite Pablo Honey track as well.<BR>   The other tracks are not bad, but there are no real standouts among them; they're melodic but also slightly bland.  All in all, Pablo Honey does have its moments of the sheer brillance that typifies all of Radiohead's subsequent albums, but it lacks cohesion and consistency.  I get the feeling that the band was still struggling to find itself.  It's an interesting listen and a worthy purchase, but moreso for someone already interested in Radiohead's music rather than someone looking to check them out for the first time.
0767827902|5.0|The Last Picture Show examines life in the small rural town of Anarene, Texas circa 1951. With such meticulous attention to detail, you would almost swear you can smell the dry dusty air, as tumble-weed blows down Main Street and Tony Bennett sings &quot;Your Cold Cold Heart&quot; on the juke box. With the oil boom behind them, Anarene clings to life until finally even their beloved movie house flickers for the last time. Appropriately enough, it's Howard Hawk's &quot;Red River&quot; that marks the end of the line as the lights go up and the doors shut for good.<br />Peter Bogdanovich's brilliant direction earned him an Oscar nomination and he should have won it. Working with a cast of virtual new-commers, Timothy Bottoms, Jeff Bridges, Cybil Shepred and Randy Quaide, Bogdanovich catches lightening in a jar and creates such in-depth character studies you truly feel like these are people you grew up with. <br />So turn out the lights set up the projector and let this one roll one last time. Thank you Peter Bogdanovich for one hell of a movie!

B000002NIW|5.0|Despite the degredation it gets for shaking away a little of the heaviness of Adrenaline, Around The Fur comes through unscathed as a beautiful and ferocious piece that rips straight into you with the blistering &quot;My Own Summer&quot; and only lets up at points for Chino to hint at what it is to come in the equally brilliant White Pony. Definitely one of my all time favourite albums. Track analysis:<br />1. &quot;My Own Summer&quot; - Amazing tune thats probably most likely to be recognised. Displays well the way Chino puts across a unique vocal style. <br />2. &quot;Lhabia&quot; - Chino slips between the high notes and muddy vocals fluidly while backed up perfectly by the throng of the guitar.<br />3. &quot;Mascara&quot; - One of the calmer moments that hits just as hard despite holding back the thrash. <br />4. &quot;Around The Fur&quot; - Title track and one of best on album with heavy guitar and intense atmosphere. Draw your own conclusions on what it all means.<br />5. &quot;Rickets&quot; - Building on the intensity of &quot;ATF&quot;, a fury is unleashed reminiscent of stuff on Adrenaline but still perfectly composed in melody and listening terms, not many bands today pull this sort of thing off well.<br />6. &quot;Be Quiet and Drive&quot; - Another of the best tunes on this CD that like the title says pushes out the boundaries as the clash of vocals, guitars, drums etc. give it a gigantic feel. <br />7. &quot;Lotion&quot; - A good song but doesn't hold up well after &quot;BQAD&quot;. Furious and angry but still able to bring in pieces of gentler musing from Chino.<br />8. &quot;Dai The Flu&quot; - Another great song (hey, the albums full of 'em!!). Love the guttural sound of the bass. Starts off quiet calm before building to a crescendo. Beautiful.<br />9. &quot;Headup&quot; - Builds swiftly to a fury and doesn't let up as we are hit with guitar chainsaw-chords that grind along to enraged vocals.<br />10. &quot;MX&quot; - Perfect closer to it all that mellows the mood a little as Chino shares vocals with female companion and everything backs them up to make an epic number.<br />Keep it up boys. Can't wait for the next album!!
B00005B36H|5.0|With the recent release of Lateralus, Tool has, once again, awed its audience with its intuitively seamless fusion of powerful lyrics, intense emotion, and haunting industrial sounds. Although songs such as \\"The Grudge,\\" \\"Schism,\\" and \\"Reflection\\" stand out as personal favorites, the album entire radiates the kind of artistic depth and poeticism only Tool has the power and sensitivity to convey. Keenan's vulnerable, intensely expressive vocals guide each track through to its sometimes triumphant.  A stunningly triumphant montage of music and word, the album's emerging theme from beginning to end is overwhelmingly one of personal growth, transcendency, healing and, ultimately, prevailing hope. Lateralus is, in true Tool tradition, a shrink-wrapped spiritual experience. So sit back and \\"just let the light touch you, just let the words spill through, and let them pass right through, bringing out our hope and reason...\\"
B00003CXZ3|1.0|&quot;Stunning&quot;, &quot;intelligent&quot;.. H! This is some of the worst movie ever made. No, Im not dumb, I understand the plot completely. But whats the point in shooting this history this way? By the way, there is no history at all. By the end of the movie, I no longer cared about Guy Pearces character search for his &quot;JOHN G.&quot; THis movies is a swindle, like &quot;THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT&quot;.
B00005QZWI|5.0|Just got this cd today, but it is absolutely amazing.  If you are a fan of John Williams, Hans Zimmer, Mitsuda, or any of those great composers of video games and movies... then I highly reccomend this CD.  Enya adds an especially nice touch to the CD with her song &quot;May It Be&quot; and Enya fans should not be disappointed by the quality at all.  The tunes displayed here fit the fantasy category very well and I can't wait to see how much flavor this masterpiece collection of music will aid the movie in making it a better experience.<br />There's not much else to say except that if you're a fan of soundtracks of great movies such as Gladiator, Star Wars, Harry Potter, etc. (like me!) then don't hesitate to buy this cd! You won't be disappointed!
0375701427|5.0|The thing I found interesting about this book was the way it detailed the splintering of American culture, the decline of our cities, the erosion of moral consensus, the growing irrelevance of religion, the self-absorption alcohol, drugs and permissiveness represent, the futility of politics and the impossibility of understanding without trying to blame anyone or anything. <BR>I think if you enjoy Herman Melville, or maybe a novel like Louis Begley's &quot;About Schmidt,&quot; you might give this one a try. Engaging, and extremely thought-provoking. Just don't come to it wanting to be cheered or reassured.
B00003CXXJ|5.0|This was a very cute movie by Disney!<BR>Not as good as the classics of course..But still worth it!<BR>I sat with children and adults during this movie showing and It seemed as though more adults were interested in the movie than the kids were.. It did have adult humor,yes.But still kids would enjoy the Digital/Graphic effects *as in the characters,and cute voices* throughout the movie! It's a great movie overall &amp; a MUST SEE!
B00003CXBK|5.0|Hayao Miyazaki does not disappoint in this latest movie that confirms again he is the Grand Master of animation, Japanese or otherwise. The art is gorgeous and the themes of Man and Nature, as in Nausicaa almost 20 years ago, are even more profound today.<br />My only complaints are there are a few too many characters and that makes the story slightly confusing. This requires careful attention by the audience. The title character does not have as strong a presense as Nausicaa, Sheeta and Pazu from Laputa, or Kiki. Still this is a strong film from a wonderful film maker.
B00005OM4N|5.0|This album is, in my opinion, Britney's best album yet.  The more personal song writing and funky R&amp;B groove make this album a must have for anyone looking for music that is not quite your average &quot;pop.&quot;  The Neptunes produced tracks &quot;I'm A Slave 4 U&quot; and &quot;Boys&quot; are highlights along with the song &quot;What It's Like&quot; written and produced by Justin Timberlake and Wade Robson.  The experimental sound shows a development and growth of Britney as an artist.  The lyrics are much more personal than her first two albums, seeing as how Britney writes 5 or 6 (exactly which i am not sure) of the songs on this album as opposed to one mediocre track on her last effort, &quot;Oops...I Did it Again.&quot; Although it is not written by Britney herself (rather written by the pop powerhouse writing team of Max Martin and Rami with Dido), the featured ballad (you know the ballad on every pop album released after the first single) &quot;Not A Girl, Not Yet A Woman,&quot; is truly a representation of the phase Britney is currently going through in her life.  Likewise with the song &quot;Overprotected&quot; (also by Max Martin and Rami).  <BR>So, In Conclusion, the new Britney album is obviously a must have for fans, and also, I think that those who criticize pop for it's lack of originality might find some joy in this album as well.  <BR>Along with artists like 'N Sync, Shakira, and, of course, Michael Jackson, Britney is leading pop down a new and uncharted path, and it will be those artists who will truly survive while others (O-Town, Backstreet Boys, Jessica Simpson, etc.) will die out along with what we used to know as &quot;pop.&quot;
B00005NP04|5.0|Talk about torture. As an avid Martina McBride fan, I've been asking myself for a few years now why a greatest hit cd hasn't been released. I mean, c'mon, Martina is such a talent and she's scored some of the biggest hits of the last decade. She's well beyond the superstar status at this point and the obvious next step was a greatest hits release. Now, after years of waiting, we fans have finally got what we wanted. <br />There are 15 hits plus 3 new ones on the cd, including the downright hilarious &quot;When God-Fearing Women Get the Blues&quot;. Martina's biggest hits, starting with her first &quot;My Baby Loves Me&quot; are: &quot;Life #9&quot;, &quot;Wild Angels&quot;, &quot;A Broken Wing&quot;, &quot;Wrong Again&quot;, and &quot;There You Are&quot;. There's also the more &quot;poppier&quot; and adult contemporary hits &quot;I Love You&quot; and &quot;Valentine&quot; (with Jim Brickman), which newer, younger fans will recognize. <br />My favorite tunes on the cd are: &quot;Safe In the Arms of Love&quot;, &quot;Whatever You Say&quot;, and the controversial &quot;Independence Day&quot;, which when first released caused such an uproar that some stations refused to play it. These three songs are Martina's best because they showcase her ability to put such power and emotion into the lyrics. For such a little thing, that gal sure can sing. She's got one of the strongest voices in the business and she isn't afraid to show it. Talk about a pair of lungs!<br />Despite the fact that I gave the cd a 5-star rating, which it totally deserves, I have a big complaint. There are a few hits that weren't included on the cd that should've been, such as &quot;Still Holding On&quot; (with Clint Black), &quot;Phones Are Ringing All Over Town&quot;, and &quot;Cheap Whiskey&quot;. There's no way you can replace these tunes with such horrible ones like &quot;Happy Girl&quot; and &quot;Love's the Only House&quot;, which in my opinion are not Martina's strongest songs. Other than that one little complaint, the cd is worth buying. <br />If you're an older fan looking to get all of your favorites on one disk, this is for you. If you're a new fan trying to catch up on everything you've missed, this is the place to start.<br />Gennie Bailey-Rogers
B00005RG6B|5.0|The performance is outstanding for one of Queenryche's best CDs.
B00005Q45W|5.0|Thanks to Leonard Cohen and Sharon Robinson for the best CD of 2001. I'm a fan and this is a classic. Not a below-average song in the lot, and some incredible gems which somehow are especially relevant post-9/11 because of the themes, lyrics and the musical mood. \\"May the lights in the Land of Plenty shine on the truth some day.\\"

B00005RFQ5|5.0|I will try to put this into words, because when you stumble upon great works such as &quot;Imagine,&quot; &quot;Revelling/Reckoning&quot; or Prince's latest, &quot;The Rainbow Children,&quot; it's almost impossible to describe. Prince has been, and will continue to, make brilliant music throughout his career. &quot;The Rainbow Children&quot; is the latest album to add to his best - this music is pure passion. Pure vision. He filters his views about God and the truth best through this album - it's more mature than &quot;Lovesexy&quot; and more thought-provoking than anything he's ever done. Musically, &quot;The Rainbow Children&quot; plays like a greatest hits package. You've got funk (&quot;The Everlasting Now,&quot; &quot;1+1+1 is 3&quot;), soul (&quot;Mellow,&quot; &quot;Muse 2 the Pharaoh&quot;) and pure ... Prince (&quot;Last December,&quot; &quot;Family Name.&quot;) I can't even begin to tell you how awesome this is. This stands on its own next to his best albums.
B00005R2M3|2.0|SHAKIRA is quite simply an explosive performer.Her beautiful<BR>looks,earthy vocals,and sensual dancing present both exotic<BR>and tropical possibilties,which comes to the likening to the<BR>fan.Too bad,Shakira's first English album,&quot;Laundry Service&quot; has<BR>to be so watered down.<BR>   The first single,&quot;Whenever Wherever&quot;(co-written by Gloria Estefan) is second-rate Shakira.It's faux-Middle eastern vibe<BR>and Shakira's incoherent yodeling may have limited &quot;TRL&quot; fans<BR>happy but real fans of Shakira's true work know better.<BR>The rest of &quot;Laundry Service&quot; is pretty much crossover hell.<BR>Full of cheesy filler and worthless ballads.It's sad to see<BR>such a first rate Latin-speaking artist like Shakira sing<BR>such bad material but it just goes to show you that 'crossover'<BR>success doesn't always mean quality music.
B00005OM4N|1.0|Quite a let-down from her previous album (too much disco influence). Most of the songs sound like variations of each other or of the weakest song of her previous album (which in my opinion was One Kiss From You). Save your money and buy Jessica Simpson's Irresistible (which is a much better album). Hopefully next time, there will be a little more time spent on writing and producing songs that are different...
B00005LOUS|1.0|I just bought the video of How the Grinch Stole Christmas, and all I can say is I WANT MY MONEY BACK!!! This is the worst movie I have ever seen. I was horrified by the entire movie. It was like the Mask only with a Christmas theme and no gangsters. This is a shining example of everything that is wrong with Hollywood. A big budget and scads of special effects do NOT make a good movie. In this case it didn't even make a decent movie. This movie lacked all the charm, humor, and fun of the original. It is by no means endearing as the original is and always will be. And the original, made with the simplest, purest, truest form of animation will remain beloved and treasured while I would like to fling my copy of the new one into a toxic waste dump. I am sure that Dr. Seuss is rolling over in his grave. My kids weren't even mildly humored by this movie. I gave this movie one star because there is no option to give it the big NONE that it deserves.
B00005QZWI|5.0|Okay, first off, there is NO difference in content between the regular and special edition versions of this soundtrack, except for the packaging.  Also, the regular soundtrack does not actually have multiple covers.  Those are just inserted \\"collector's cards.\\"  Underneath all of them is the same CD cover insert.  On to the music!<BR>This is quite possibly one of the most well rounded and beautiful soundtracks I've ever had the pleasure to listen to.  More than ever, I am excited about seeing this film.  The themes are well suited to the characters, particularly the Hobbit theme, which will be transfered to Frodo and eventually grow from a quaint baroque tune into a sweeping epic melody towards the end.  The inclusion of Enya's music has an incredible effect.  The music is very exciting, often employing huge choruses in an operatic style.  There are also moments of calm, quite music, but always ALWAYS with a growing tension underneath, as if the ring was ever present in the music itself.  If you enjoy John Williams, Danny Elfman, or Hans Zimmer, this soundtrack will not disappoint you.  The composer, Howard Shore, is best known for his music from Silence of The Lambs, and he effortlessly brings all the quiet horror of that work, marvelously blending with the epic quality of Lord of The Rings.  If the music is one of the primary characters of a movie, than this is going to be one ... of a film.
B00004Y7SF|5.0|Usually when I ride with my friend she makes me listen to Christmas music such as the home alone soundtrack, Sounds of the Seasons, and other lame tunes that I cant stand. But then the other day she put in Christina Aguilaria's My Kind Of Christmas and I couldn't believe what I was listening to it was so good the best Christmas music I have ever heard. The way she hits each note at such a high pitch and how she can carry it out totally amazes me. I would recomend this CD to anyone that loves to hear people that have amazing talent such as Christina Aguilaria.
B00005OM4Q|1.0|This review pertains to the Almost Famous Untitled - The Bootleg Cut (Director's Edition) which is another example of studio executives taking advantage of loyal customers by coming out with yet ANOTHER DVD version to suck the very last penny out of those same fans who made the film successful to begin with! I am so tired of this marketing strategy bs! ONE STAR! Don't buy it! Wait till the &quot;Almost Famous - Expanded Edition&quot; or the &quot;Almost Famous - Criterion Edition&quot; or the &quot;Almost Famous - Platinum Edition containing a commentary with Cameron Crowe's sister-in-law!&quot;
0783240503|5.0|I got my first taste of this show while channel surfing one evening.  I caught just a little bit of the song &quot;Close Every Door to Me&quot; and was facinated.  I went online and bought the film right away.<BR>This is a great film for the whole family. Following the biblical story of Joseph and his brothers, the catchy tunes, great scenery and bright colors will keep even the youngest child interested.  Donny Osmond is perfect in the role of Joseph and Joan Collins has a brief but funny cameo as Mrs. Potiphar.  This is a must see for any musical fan.
B00005RFAI|5.0|If you liked &quot;Can't Take Me Home&quot;, you'll love &quot;Missundaztood&quot;. Although some songs are similar to her earlier work, track four &quot;Get This Party Started&quot; is a vibrant and unique addition to this excellent CD. I have listened to this song dozens of times over the past 2 days and it has yet to get old. There is also an &quot;Enhanced&quot; section on the CD for the computer with a lyric guide and photo section. In addition, a secret website is revealed which once logged on has a special bonus track called &quot;Catch 22&quot; which is well worth the effort logging on. I won't give you the website, you have to buy the CD to find out!! Enjoy!
0385505833|4.0|This is my first John Grisham book i've ever read so i wasn't expecting anything wonderful from him. But i ended up likeing this book. It's really entertaining, the story never gets dull. It's a quick/easy book to read. It's a good novel.
B00005614M|5.0|For any fan of Jazz, Classical or Miles... you must buy this album. The new RVG remastering shines clearer light on this revolutionary masterpiece (it single-handedly sparked the entire &quot;cool&quot; west-coast Jazz movement, bringing to bear artists such as Chet Baker, Gerry Mulligan, Stan Getz and Dave Brubeck). Never harsh, always swinging, this magnificent blend of improvisation and composition (the voicings are simply ecstatic!) is truly unique - no other album or band in the history of music has sounded quite like the group put together for this recording. The lines are intricate, harkening back to the Charlie Parker/Dizzy Gillespie Be-Bop recordings of the early 40's (which preceded this album, more-or-less), but are taken with a swinging, sing-song, sensual, casual mood and style that is guaranteed to take the edge off. And to imagine, it was Miles' first REAL debut as a leader!
B00004YW6I|5.0|I have heard about PJ Harvey for years, but finally bought this one after much coaxing from friends.  A great rock n' roll album: terrific lyrics, tunes, and energy to boot!
0446608955|4.0|I have just finished reading this book and all I can say is- what a good book. I was hooked at the prologue and couldn't put it down until I had read every page. <br />I am not an emotional person by nature but just as the author warns in the prologue- I smiled then I cried.<br />This is definately a chick book and I guess the ending could be deemed a little hokey especially for a 17 year old to come to such a conclusion and I think, too, that Jamie might have been just a little too pious to be true, but I don't care. This was a great little book and I'm glad I read it.
B00005Q66T|4.0|Ok, ok, so the title is misleading.  True, most of the songs were indeed hits, but some clearly weren't. Still, the album is a great compilation of some of Madonna's best songs.  The non-hits (&quot;Bedtime Story&quot;, &quot;Human Nature&quot;, &quot;Drowned World&quot;, &quot;Don't Cry For Me Argentina&quot;) still sound beautiful even though they were pretty much ignored by pop radio.  As for the rest of the album, it's a trip through Madonna's greatest moments in the last decade.  It's a pity the CD has no room for other missing hits (&quot;Fever&quot;, &quot;Rain&quot;, &quot;Bad Girl&quot;, &quot;You Must Love Me&quot;, &quot;You'll See&quot;, &quot;Nothing Really Matters&quot;, &quot;American Pie&quot;).  The one truly disappointing facet of this album is the lack of new material.  However, after the long hard toils of the spectacular Drowned World Tour, I can see why Madonna didn't have time.  GHV2 is a great compilation for fans and non-fans alike.
B00005QK3W|5.0|The word which springs immediately to mind when listening to this album is 'maturity'. Finally Paul exposes his soul with the songs such as 'From A Lover To A Friend' and 'Lonely Road'. And where did Paul find this band ? The music is very tight and competent. We are also treated to a few classic McCartney ballads such as 'Your loving Flame' and 'I Do'. It's amazing how Paul can still be innovative after so many years with the successful experiments 'Riding into Jaipur' and 'Rinse The Raindrops'. As for 'Freedom' this song is perhaps one verse short of being an all-time classic. A middle section by Paul's old friend John would certainly have made this a timeless classic. Overall the album is Paul's best since 'Band on the run'
B00004Z459|4.0|(...) So Linkin Park is more pop-rock/nu-metal than their precious 'heavy metal'. So? Rock is a broad term-- there's plenty of space for the Metallica of old and the Linkin Park of today<br />What boggles my mind even more is that people somehow believe that commercial success equals bad music. (...) Even RATM is played on the airwaves, regularly. Any 'good' band you can think of is regularly (or at least semi-regularly) played on the airwaves. Linkin Park is no exception. So what if they have girls crowded around them. So did the Beatles. (...)<br />Now that the little rant is over, i advise you to buy this CD. It is eminantly listenable and doesn't get old that fast (unlike most of hte rest of nu-metal). There are some weak points on the CD, but nothing too bad, nothing worth always skipping, anyway. <br />On a level with Tool? SoaD? RATM? I think not. But, it's good enough. Judge a CD on its merits, not what it's not. One Step Closer is pretty good. Crawling isn't bad. In the End is probably the best song on the album, followed maybe by Papercut. All of it is listenable enough, yet has a bit of an edge to it. Infinitely preferable to boy bands<br />Consider this CD if you are a fan of more poppy rock. (...)
0920668364|5.0|I first hear this story read at a funeral for my dear friend's father.  I can't believe what other readers are seeing; the lewdness of society.  To me, this story just reiterates the unconditional love a mother has for her child.  As a mother, of a nine-year-old, sometimes I do feel like selling her to a zoo. But I always feel like the luckiest person on earth to be blessed with such a wonderful child.  Sometimes I hope that she never grows up; I'm going to miss tucking her in at night.  The ending of the book is especially touching.  A lot of my friends are caring for their elderly parents now, and it seems that their parents are more and more childlike as they slip away, and the children take on the role of the parents.  So, I hope my child will love me when I am old as much as I love her.
B00005QK3W|5.0|That's all I hafta say for &quot;Driving Rain&quot;---magic. Just like the song it must've been magic. I love pretty much everything Paul's ever done. But this truely shows his genius. His emotions since Linda, the dealth of Linda and now finding love in Heather are all thrown together in this very emotional very wonderful album. I think this is one of his best. I hope the sales for it go up quite a bit he deserves it to sell amazingly well.
0316776963|3.0|David Sedaris's first books, BARREL FEVER and NAKED, brought him from cult status to national celebrity status because of his singularly hilarious vision of the world. But much of his humor in those books depended on his scruffy, outsider economic status (he made his money before he became famous cleaniong other people's houses in Manhattan) and his extremely bizarre and loveable large family from North Carolina. It was easy to love Sedaris's self-deprecating hero because he was such an underdog; you couldn't help wanting him to win.<br />But since he's become a success his subject matter has changed while his tone has not. It's very hard to feel sorry and luagh at Sedaris's circumstances when his problems include assimilating properly into French culture (his boyfriend owns a farmhouse in Normandy) or choosing among overfancy dishes at expensive Manhattan restaurants. The best bits in this collection--the first story about his lisp correction therapy, his account of his father's peculiar eating habots, and his classic &quot;Big Boy&quot;--retain Sedaris' sense of himself as underdog, and thus are hilarious; the rest of the collection is quite disappointing for those who loved Sedaris's first two books.
044022425X|5.0|I put off reading this 4th book in the series because I didn't think I'd like enjoy the American scene.  I was not happy with the 3rd book.  But I so enjoyed DRUMS OF AUTUMN!  I can't wait to read the next one.  I loved this book, MUCH better than the 3rd.  It didn't hold me right away - I wasn't hooked until Jamie &amp; Claire stayed with Aunt Jocasta - but the book seduced me and by the time they set off from River Run, I was reading in the car at lunch, reading through dinner, and devouring the story.  The author's description of the American setting enthralled me, as did the goings on of farming, economy, indian relations, etc.  Claire and Jamie's scenes together were still the best in the book, but I did enjoy Bree &amp; Roger's relationship toward the end, but still not as much.  I LOVED THE ENDING!!!  That last chapter really was the perfect end to this wonderful story.  Hurray Gabaldon!  ...and Thanks.
B00005RFAI|5.0|I have to tell you that I had no intrest in Pink's 1st CD, but when I heard how she stalked Linda Perry it caught my eye.  I was astoundingly suprised.  What starts out as a very cool party CD (and I do mean VERY COOL!) blows up into a bluesy and intensly melodic groove thing.  Good Golly! Somehow I think that Pink doesn't even know what she's capable of and all the better for us listeners.  She is profound and believable; the real deal! Anyone and Everyone should give this a try. PINK!
B0000019PA|5.0|That's what you can hear someone in the studio shouting as Jeff Mangum finishes the centerpiece of this album, 'Oh Comely'. That pretty much sums up what I feel too. This is one of those albums that hits you like a ton of bricks. If you're here you probably already have a good idea of what NMH sounds like (Elephant 6 and all that) but what you might not know if you haven't heard the album is that Magnum is -much- better than his E6 counterparts.<br /> While some of his friends in bands like Apples (In Stereo) or Olivia Tremor Control dabbled in pretensious sound collages or 60's throwback songs, Magnum released one of the classic albums of the '90s. It's a collection of arresting solo accoustic songs and horn-filled \\"fuzz folk\\" tunes. Sounds wierd I know. But the strange thing is how well the diverse sounds of this album flow together. A quiet accoustic number like \\"2-Headed Boy\\" flows into a beautiful horn instrumental which morphs into the up-tempo lo-fi masterpiece \\"Holland, 1945.\\" <br />  The lyrics hold everything together. Mangum has created something resembling a theme album revolving around World War II, Anne Frank and his own childhood. You get the feeling that this guy has a tenous grasp of reality, since the two subjects seem to blend together in his mind. The songs, taken as a whole, evoke a feel of dreamlike sadness. And if you're reading this thinking, \\"Ugh, a concept album about Anne Frank, how pretensious\\" it really isn't. Jeff is so heartfelt and honest, but not in an 'emo' way -- no weepy self-pity here. It's hard to believe an album of such maturity and honesty came from a man in his mid 20s.<br />   I know I'm rambling here but there's a lot I have to say about this album. It's not all good. People tend to overreact about \\"Aeroplane\\", I think because they feel such a strong emotional connection to Jeff's lyrics. Even though the things he sings about are very cryptic and surreal, you feel empathy and unity with the guy. But this often makes exaggerate how good it is. \\"Aeroplane\\" is not the best album of the 90's, Jeff Mangum is not the best musician today. That said, it's still an almost unbelievably emotionally arresting and intimate collection of songs that retain an E6 style accessability and catchiness. Be prepared for this album to effect your mood and also your musical taste. When I first bought it it was the only thing I listened to for at least a week. I'm stunned that this album just came out of the wood-work. While it might not be the best album of the '90's, its definitely one of the most interesting. Everyone who likes music should own it.
B00005K3NR|5.0|Carrie is not so much a horror movie as it is a revenge movie. Spacek's performance is heartbreaking as the traumatized teen who everyone seems to dislike. Carrie's life is a living hell both at school and at home with her fanatically religous mother. The viewer immediately sympathizes with Carrie and we feel good when Carrie starts coming out of her shell. When she dresses up and goes to the prom with her handsome date we feel as though the ugly duckling is becoming a beautiful swan. But suddenly a vicious final prank unleashes Carries' telekinesis full force on the prom crowd. The special effects are good, but weak in some parts. For example the part where Nancy Allen and Travolta get theirs is too short and somewhat contrived. It just seems to come out of nowhere with no build at all. But aside from that, the movie is perfect. One thing that made this movie great for me was the music. Carrie's theme heard in the beginning and at the end is one of the most beautifully haunting melodies I've ever heard in film. Hearing that melody for the first time at the beginning of the movie just captured me and never let go. Carrie is a wonderful movie any way you look at it.
B000002G7E|5.0|This is my favorite Velvet album... more experimental than their earlier lp 'Velvet Underground and Nico' but before John Cale left the band. Every song is a classic. And that guitar! Some of Lou Reed's guitar work on this album is still ahead of its time. <br />P.S. Unlike what others might say on here, Sister Ray is the best song on the album.
0671449028|5.0|My son loves this book and refuses to go to bed until we have done all the activites the book characters do...including HANGING TOWELS up and BRUSHING TEETH.  This is a good one!!
B00003Q43A|5.0|Independence day is a great movie with will smith, jeff goldblum and Bill Pullman. The dvd itself is spectacular! There are so many special features and an hours worth of hidden features. The 3d interactive menus are incredible. I still havnt finished watching all the features. If you liked the movie a little bit buy it because all the special features are worth it.<br />I recommend this movie to ages 13 &amp; up.
B00005OWEG|4.0|The movie is 5 Stars and the Redux version is worth seeing.  This is one of the few movies since The Abyss where where the extra movie footage adds to the movie.<br />BUT THE LACK OF VITUALLY ANY EXTRAS IS A TOTAL DISAPPOINTMENT.  Here's my suggestion, rent it at Blockbuster and wait for the Directors version of Redux with comentary and a new making of (you know it will happen).
B000001ESP|5.0|Let me first say that I think Rush are a truly great band.  They took awesome musical skills, a taste for SF and utopian literature, catchy 70's hard rock, and progressive music and turned out album after album of great music, and through this influenced everyone from Primus to Dream Theater to Phish.  My dad gave this to me when I first began listening to a wide variety of classic rock.  That was quite a while ago,  but hardly a week passes that I don't listen to this album the whole wat through.  Seven songs, each one different, display the virtuoso talent of the &quot;Three Man Army.&quot;  I sometimes find it difficult to believe that there are only three musicians playing.  It sounds like a miniture orchestra at times.  This fact is only another demonstration of the talent of Rush.  They are also careful not to let the musicianship overwhelm the music.  One thing that might dissappoint prog fans is the lack of the long epic.  If you enjoy the extra-long excursions then I suggest you try &quot;2112&quot; first.  If you're tastes lean to more towards traditional rock stylings then this is a better place to start.  But regardless,  any progressive-rock fan who hasn't heard Rush needs to check this out.  And to the classic-rockers out there, this is an album you can't miss.
B00005QZWI|5.0|Time will tell, but I have only had this soundtrack for a few hours, and already I'm thinking it will make my list of all time favorites.  (At this point, only &quot;Conan the Barbarian&quot; and &quot;The Thin Red Line&quot; are on it securely with &quot;Gladiator&quot;, &quot;Last of the Mohicans&quot; and &quot;Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country&quot; potentially rounding out the rest of it)<br />I haven't decided on which tracks are the best ones, thus far.  It's always a difficult task when it turns out that they are ALL good.  Anybody who has bought a record or two in their lifetime knows how impossible that concept is.  <br />As a fan of the books, I'm finding that I particularly enjoy track 13, 'The Bridge of Khazad Dum'.  Track 1, 'The Prophesy' is also very good.  'A Knife in the Dark' is great.  Heck, they all are.  I know I'm gushing over this one, but I'm really impressed with it.  <br />Really, I'm not typically all that kind with my reviews.  I have a few others on here.  But this one really is good.<br />In my view, a good soundtrack not only adds to the film it was made for, but also tells a story of its own.  It is extremely rare that such a score should come out.  This is one of the few.
B000002ADT|5.0|Not alot to be said about this other than its the work of a Musical Genius.<BR>After Fourty years its still one the most-sought-after recordings in the country.<BR>As of late 1998 it was the best selling Jazz album of the year.<BR>In Rolling Stone and Amazon.com end of the century polls, it was voted one of the ten best albulms of all time.<BR>The only Jazz album ever to reach double platinum status.

B0000028RR|5.0|This os one of my all-time favorite cds, and rage's best.  The anarchist lyrics are generally excellent, but once you realize that rage is signed with sony, a corporate giant, and that guitarist tom morello went to Harvard, a rightist school, you start to wonder...<BR>Still- an excellent album that i recommend to any fan of heavy music or rap, or punk, even if you dont agree with the politics or think they are hypocritical
B00000IMYA|5.0|The 1956 Newport COncert is legendary in Jazz and Ellingtonia. Ellington's orchestra had been struggling and out of the spotlight for years, came on. Elington was about to be on the cover of Time and needed something new to respark the fire.<br />After an initial set of the Star-Spangled Banner that got the band angry due to the rain and interruption, the band came back and gave a smoking performance that got the crown dancing. The audience reaction was so strong that the Festival organizer was worried about a riot.<br />The orchestra was relaunched, and began the second half of their career, which would lead on to great things.<br />Unfortunately, the studio gave out a bogus CD for years, re-editing the tracks in the studio and putting it on the CD. This release fixes that, by putting the original concert recordings on the track, and leaving the studio cuts as a bonus.
B00005RFQ5|4.0|The scattered reviews I had heard of The Rainbow Children, prior to its general CD release, were full of great praise. I had high expectations on listening to the album but it fulfilled and even surpassed them at times. It has excitement but also depth. There are songs that instantly appeal (for example, the ultra funky The Work pt. 1, or the gospel Last December). There are also songs more challenging to the pop-music ear but which definitely grow on you with each listening (like the Rainbow Children with its modern jazz feel). After releasing some albums that have been disappointing in part, Prince has returned to his former name and quality. Cool and assured, and about time. Excellent.
B00005QIPH|4.0|I picked up the Modern Age ep a few months ago and was blow away at the raw, hard rocking sound.  I also had the opportunity to see the Strokes live a month or so ago and they were true to form with the EP.  I just picked up the LP yesterday and was  disappointed about the amount of polish the mixers put on the songs.  Not to say that this lp is bad, it has some great songs, but it lacks the power of the ep.  <br />If you already have the LP and love it, but the ep and take it to the next level.<br />If you're thinking about picking this up, buy the ep instead and save your money for the next release.  Hopefully the record company will let The Strokes sound like they do live on that one.  Raw, Powerful and Hard
0345442989|4.0|Every Episode I book I read was better than the movie which inspired it, which isn't saying much. This book is more noteworthy now because it is the first book to deal with terrorism head-on AND 3 months before September 11th. Reading the book today is a bit eerie and hopefully they won't censor it when it comes out in paperback. I wonder if the author James Luceno was thinking of Al Quida when he wrote it. Check out this passage from Supreme Chancellor Valorum on page 161 and just substitute Taliban for Vandron and Elegin and Afghanistan for Asmeru.<br />''I have communicated with the rulers of Houses Vandron and Elegin, who hold sway over Asmeru and other systems in that part of the Senex sector. They deny granting the Nebula Front safe haven. Rather, they contend that the terrorists seized Asmeru from a scant indigenous population, and have been using the planet as a base of operations for raids against ships plying the Rimma Trade Route and Corellian Trade Spine. Wishing to avoid becoming targets of the Nebula Front, Houses Vandron and Elegin have essentially ignored activities on Asmeru.''
B00005LMBK|5.0|ok. First of all i just want to say Gorillaz are amazing. It's true, they are one of the weirdest bands I've ever heard but its the best (...) type of weird ever. They are just so awesome. There's something for everyone in their music! I took my chances and bought this cd with mainly only listening to Clint Eastwood(never do that) and found lots of their songs were just as good if not better!Don't be taken by their EXPLICIT CONTENT sign, there's barely anything bad on it(...)In the pictures and things you see of them there image is all punk (...) gangsters who do graffiti on walls(dumb idea don't do it)but once I heard \\"19 2000\\" I laughed, it's so upbeat and happy! I'm telling you buy this cd. I bought it and it's probably the best cd i'll ever buy in my life. These guys are the future.
B000007VCM|5.0|Forget all the cheesy glam metal bands of the 80's.  This album has MUCH more to offer!!  The Cult, I have noticed, interestingly appeals to modern rock &amp; classic rock listeners, and even goth rockers, without being out of place.  And UNLIKE those other forgettable glam bands, they're STILL around too!!  Could it be because they're British...I also only happen to only really like Def Leppard out of all those mid-80's rock bands that came out (also british, just something I've noticed).<br />This album is SOLID as can be.  Someone once told me &quot;the thing I don't like about the Cult is all their songs sound the same&quot;, which I think is one of the easiest complaints anyone can make on any band.  Sure, many bands' songs sound similar, but if you like their style enough, why should it bother you??  And I really don't think their songs all sound identical, just similar enough to keep the same groove going and to keep the listener listening if they're hooked.  Anyway, the guitar work of Duffy's is singing, and Ian Astbury's vocals are at best here, I think.<br />Disclaimer:  As I sit here listening to the cd, I noticed on the tracklist here on Amazon, there's a couple of song titles missing that are on the one I have, so make sure you get the version with 12 tracks.  Don't bother asking me track titles, I'm bad with those ;)  Also, having purchased cds online before, sometimes the cd you actually get doesn't mention a song or 2 anyway, so that just might be the case here.<br />The first track, &quot;Nirvana&quot; (before the band of the same name was even heard of), makes a great opener.  &quot;Big Neon Glitter&quot; has become one of my &quot;must-repeat-again&quot; tracks.  I especially like the catchy guitar riff.  &quot;Brother Wolf, Sister Moon&quot; is my favorite track at the moment...slow, mesmorizing, classic!!  Ok, I'm really in love with this song at the moment, as I've only heard about 5 times today :)  With the next track &quot;Rain&quot;, if you haven't heard this on the radio, where have you been?!?!  The riff on &quot;The Phoenix&quot; kinda reminds me of Concrete Blonde's descending bass line to &quot;Bloodletting&quot;.  Having previously heard &quot;Revolution&quot; on the 'High Octane Cult' greatest hits compilation (which is the 1st cd by them that I purchased a while back), I had to get myself in the mood to hear it, but after hearing it on the album, it makes a little more sense.  &quot;She Sells Sanctuary&quot; is certainly one of the best well-known songs here, and definitely still my favorite of the band.  The last track &quot;Black Angel&quot;, similar to &quot;Brother Wolf&quot;, closes the album nicely with a switch back to a mellow feel, and I especially like the soothing effects of the background vocals.<br />So if you must have one Cult album, or if you're deciding which one to get, start with this one, &amp; you WILL NOT be disappointed.  I've known OF The Cult only since '93 &amp; have gradually heard more songs over the years.  I have also only within the past year gotten this album, &amp; I already think this has moved up to my top 10 albums list!!  Also check out their new album 'Beyond Good &amp; Evil', which has a heavier &amp; more modern rock sound to it, but is still the same Cult we all know &amp; love.haven't heard this on the radio, where have you been?!?!

B000002UA0|2.0|It's a completely different PF. As if it were some other band. I hate to think my IQ is high enough only to love what Waters has been doing with the band and without it, but I think I just have to live with it. Roger, what've you been doing on this album :-))))) Take Up Thy Stethoscope And Leave is definitely a song by a beginner, but this is natural. <br />I bought the album, as many did, for the sake of &quot;filling the final spaces&quot; in my collection. The album sounds somewhat &quot;outdated&quot;. Vocals are uninteresting, though there is this strange emotional colouring of Syd's voice which may attract those who want to be attracted. Music is not very coherent, a bit of definite melodies here or there (though nothing really memorable), but a lot of instrumental music which sounds like an improvisation. (Note: I DO NOT love Dark Side and in general I have never heard a single PF song performed on radio - not withstanding Gilmour incarnation of the group which I neither take into consideration nor care about).  I suppose it was great listening to PF of that time playing all those songs live, but not for a studio CD. As far as drugs are concerned... if a music sounds good only if you're high... well, it is definitely worth nothing. It is experimental, but OK - if something sounds very unorthodox and experimental, it doesn't mean it is good just because it breaks all the rules Some pieces are plain boring. This album sounds like an exercise to me, an experiment. It is a joke, which is great as a joke, but it doesn't really touch your heart, doesn't make you think. IMHO, of course. It is definitely touched by madness. It is a very cold album.  Just think about songs like Pigs, Dogs, Possible Pasts, The Trial, One of my Turns, or the whole of Amused to Death - they are filled with raw passion, pain, cold humour, but the creative work of Barrett is really &quot;out there&quot;, an art for the sake of art itself. There are a lot of strange worlds drawn by artistslike say Eugene Ionesco, Vonnegut, Tolkien, but while some of such worlds are rooted in our reality and take it to a higher and more mystical level, the other worlds are completely detached from a human psyche. If you like such kind of artwork, it is for you.<br />There are some interesting songs though. Matilda Mother, Flaming, The Scarecrow, and Bike (the last one being the best). Chapter 24 - an obvious reminder of Tomorrow Never Knows. <br />P.S. Oh, and by the way, this one isn't Pink, and neither is Gilmour :))))
B00005QZWI|5.0|From listening to this album, one is pulled somewhat violently into Arda, with all its history, elegance, power, beauty, culture, and divine magnificance.  The orchestral performances by Howard Shore and Enya are not the greatest musical compositions known to man since the days of Mozart, but are certainly the most fitting for such a grand and fantastical movie. Each track seems to describe a certain part of Arda. For example, while listening to &quot;Concerning Hobbits,&quot; one can help little but to see the hobbits of Bags End amidst their pleasant, joyful livlihoods.  This album will do good justice for most Lord of the Rings fans and is a strikingly savory appetizer for the movie to come.
B00005QZWI|5.0|This music is great, it is just perfect for the movie. All the music is so exciting, and there aren't any bad or O.k songs in the album. It is better than Star Wars's &quot;duel of the fates&quot;, all though some of the tracks do remind me of it, with all the singing. You'll definately won't regret buying this CD!
B00005RFQ5|5.0|Prince, in recent times, got a little strange.  New Power Soul was terrible, while Rave Un2 The Joy Fantastic was fairly good (not Gold Experience caliber, but good).  Here, &quot;The Rainbow Children&quot; seems to be in a completely different vein from Prince's other stuff.  The music has something of a symphonic connectivity to it...which results in a lot of odd segues (which contain very cool uses of sounds and jams).  But then we get to pieces like &quot;the work pt 1,&quot; in which we seem to have James Brown reincarnated.  Prince has not lost his abilities here.  Nor has he lost creativity.  This is one weird, weird album.  But it is very much worth it.
B00000J7J7|5.0|Top marks to Brad Mehldau in creating something unique and beautiful from a myriad of influences.  This music succeeds in incorporating &quot;classical&quot; sensibilities within a contemporary jazz sound.

0451203933|5.0|From his amusing detail of 'hangar' life to the morbid detail of decapitated 'Skinnies' (nickname for Somalis) and disfigured Rangers, Mark describes the harrowing account of Task Force Ranger's ill-fated mission to capture Aidid's lieutenants. What was initially thought of as a cakewalk 1 hour at most mission rapidly turned into a 17+ hours of life and death struggles for the 4-chalks, D-boys and Blackhawk pilots. How could a group of elite forces from the most powerful military nation in the world with the most sophisticated weaponry known to man be completely pinned down and nearly massacred by an armed band of amateur fighters ? What went wrong ? Could the massacre have been prevented ? Mark does a very nice job of describing the simultaneous events and actions in a serial medium such as a book. He interleaves facts, tidbits of information for you to catch your breath between the gun fights and combat description so that as fast pace as the fire fights were, the reader does not feel lost in all the actions. It would have been more informative had there been more maps or more detailed maps or pictures of the location. All in all, I couldn't put the book down after I started reading it. Great, great read. You'll be thoroughly 'entertained' (if there's such a thing about war reporting) and 'educated' (about our military commanders, elite soldiers and our foreign policy toward Somalia at that time) in my opinion.  Mark tells the untold story that must be told.
B00000J7J7|5.0|Top marks to Brad Mehldau in creating something unique and beautiful from a myriad of influences.

6304711891|5.0|&quot;The Rock&quot; is an all around fantastic movie. The characters are easy to identify with and likeable, and the action scenes leave nothing to be desired. Most of all, the story is very easy to believe, and entirely possible. The layout of the scenes is perfect, and you feel as though your right there along wiht the characters. Superb acting jobs are done by Cage and Connery, as well as the supporting cast. Most of all, the music that plays in the background during tense scenes and action scenes is another perfectly accomplished feat by Hans Zimmer.
B00003CXZ4|5.0|This is a must have movie.  <BR>This movie is just great, awesome, the best in a long time!...
0385505833|1.0|As one who is attempting to simplify my own holiday celebrations, I was hoping for a tale that thumbed its nose at the rampant commercialism encountered this time of year.  There was some of that, but mostly I was rewarded with a very strong conformist message.  &quot;Don't be a free thinker...don't make your own choices...just follow the herd and do what everyone else does&quot;. If you don't want to participate in Christmas, that's fine, just look out for your neighbors and so-called friends.  If I had to live anywhere near that street, I would high-tail it to the country.
B00005MAM2|5.0|You have to see this! It is one of the best animes ever! It's right up there with Trigun, Gundam, and <BR>Dragonball Z!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
0385505833|5.0|It's a concept most of us have contemplated at one time.  The antics are fun and enjoyable, as are the characters.  This fast read will make a great Christmas gift to any Scrooge on your Christmas list!  I'm buying one for my brother-in-law; it sure beats the Grinch tie I bought him last year!
0345347951|4.0|I wish we could give fractional ratings.... I would give this one 4.5 stars.<br />This is another great book from a great author. I read it a long time ago and really enjoyed it. I recently re-read it and still enjoyed it.<br />What an idea... Clarke can really come up with great story concepts. I will not give the story away. But, this one will really make you think.<br />A must read for all hardcore Sci-Fi readers.
B00005JKHP|5.0|This DVD is a must have, just only for the Michael Okuda commentary. Really watch it once with his comments, great.<br />But Robert Wise should have changed the ending too. Like &quot;The Final Frontier&quot; its really, really thin on content in this respect. The Final Frontier has the advantage of a great campfire ending, but even such a final, and definitive StarTrek, sequence is missing here. Its just effects. Why is Decker suddenly so happy to disappear, as he has expresses only mistrust before?<br />But our Star Trek actors are performing at their best again, you even don't see the new uniforms after a while.<br />Its just the ending I don't like, so that's why I rated it 4 as not being perfect.<br />This edition is loaded with documentaries and other shots. Highly recommended.
B00005QG9J|5.0|Morning View is without a doubt Incubus' best album ever, after hearing S.C.I.E.N.C.E. I didn't think it would be possible for them to top it, but they did in every sense of the word. This is a very diverse album combining styles found on all of the previous Incubus albums and conquering completely new territory. This album is part heavy, part mellow, and part melodic. This album also shows 5 of the most talented musicians around today, guitarist Mike Einziger, bassist Dirk Lance, drummer Jose Pasillas, dj Chris Kilmore, and vocalist Brandon Boyd creating an album so different than anything anyone has heard before. There is absolutely no filler on the album at all. The heavier songs on the cd are Circles, Blood On the Ground, Have You Ever which sounds like it could've been on SCIENCE and Under My Umbrella which is one of my favorite songs by them. The more melodic songs such as Just A Phase, Warning, and Echo are amazing, they show that Incubus isn't worried about the trends and they make the music that they want to make. The singles released off the album, Wish You Were Here and Nice to Know You are also amazing. By now I'm sure you've heard Wish You Were Here, it combines the best elements of the album, it's melodic and acoustic based with great vocals, and Nice to Know You is more of a rock song, which is great, think Pardon Me just better and more mellow. There are also a few acoustic songs on the album, 11 a.m. is excellent, the band sounds great and the lyrics are very good. The other acoustic song, Mexico, is very different, it's probably the darkest and most moody song on the album, but it's still good. Aqueous Transmission closes the album, it is by far their most experimental song ever, it is almost 8 minutes long and features Mike Einziger using a Japanese instrument called a Koyoto. It is a very peaceful song complete with flute in the background and Brandon Boyd's almost whispered vocals. Now that I've said all of this how can you not by this album, it's without a doubt Insubus' best, and for it to be better than SCIENCE which is a masterpiece it's definately worth your money.....so what are you waiting for?
B00005QEO2|4.0|Where is &quot;Once is Enough&quot;?  It is one of my all-time favorites by this band and I have been waiting for it to appear on some compilation or another for upwards of ten years.  I guess I'll have to keep on waiting.  The inclusion of this song would have warranted a rating of fifteen stars.
B00000FBRE|4.0|\\"I'm calling you out, taking your shield...\\"  Yes, I'm calling out each and every single person that has something other than a positive opinion about this CD.  This CD totally redefined the meaning of \\"punk.\\"  \\"Punk\\" is now expressing your innermost feelings in a catchy verse or pouring out your soul onto a 35 minute long CD that isn't guaranteed to be listened to anyone except your band and their mothers.<BR>   But amid all the serious content comes something to relax you and put you at ease: elevator muzak.  How many other bands would even dream of putting muzak in the middle of one of their most serious song?  Not many.  And how many could pull it off well?  Even fewer.  The overall tone of the CD instills in a person the sense of \\"Hey, maybe everything isn't so bad after all.\\"<BR>   \\"Let's Talk About Feelings\\" does just that.  It talks about the feelings of many teenage kids (and perhaps middle-age English teachers) in a presentable manner that would be very hard to dismiss as pointless noise.  Lagwagon definitely succeeded in their effort to talk about feelings and after listening to the CD, I felt a sense of peace that I had never before experienced while listening to music.  Lagwagon's music is worth listening to.
B000001ES4|4.0|Wow. This a truly amazing CD. I kept hearing great things about Secret Garden, and I finally picked up a copy of White Stones. I can't figure out how I got by without this music! I like to describe it as a Classical/Celtic sound, but I'm not sure if it will fit into any category. EVERY song is so wonderful, and aside from a tiny problem with the accordian thing that goes on in track 5 (hence the 4-star rating), I don't have a complaint with ANY of them. BUY THIS CD! Enya fans--don't miss out! This is right up your alley. Of course that goes for everyone--unless you're a total clod, you will LOVE this music.
B00005LKIM|5.0|Dr. Lector has the need for flesh!  Can Clarice handle the case? <BR>After her recent demotion, she is assigned the &quot;Hannibal the Cannibal&quot; case.  Hannibal is now over is Italy studying art.  I won't give away any more.  I'll let you check out the VHS or DVD from your local library, video store, or Blockbuster.  Try watching it while eating cow liver and pig feet!  And just remember.....people don't really don't kill people and eat them and have a FBI agent chasing them(okay, well some do).  It's just a movie!  Enjoy!
B00005QXXO|5.0|During their past tour, I had the opportunity to see Radiohead twice, and I must say that they have to be the best live act around. The I Might Be Wrong: Live Recordings is the closest you can get to a live Radiohead show without leaving your house. Each track is just how I remember hearing it live. The quality of each song is superb and sounds just like it did when I saw the band play them live back in August.  <BR>There are two tracks I could have lived with out: Idioteque and Everything In It's Right Place. Idioteque is perhaps my favorite Radiohead song, but the live version is just OK. There are certain songs that sound spectacular on record, but in person are just OK, and Idioteque and Everything In It's Right Place are two of them. Don't get me wrong, the band pulls them off great. They are just nothing special. A live Knives Out, or You And Whose Army would have been better choices for this CD.<BR>The two money tracks on this CD are Like Spinning Plates and True Love Waits, and the two alone are worth the price of the album. When I saw the guys play, Like Spinning Plates was one of the encores and I was blown away by how beautiful it was. The recording found here is fantastic and sounds just like I remembered it. As for True Love Waits, I've only been waiting for it to be properly released for years! The version found here is one of the best I've heard Thom pull off, and the recording is crisp and clear.  <BR>One last thing. I really dig I Might Be Wrong as a live track. Its got more bite when they do it live, and you can hear the difference from the Amnesiac version on this recording.  <BR>This is a must buy CD for any Radiohead fan.
B000002LSV|3.0|This is an excellent collection of ZZ Top hits.  Some of the classics, particularly &quot;La Grange&quot;, have been re-mixed with WAY too much reverb.  In my opinion, this ruins a classic sound, which was very tight and done right the first time around.<br />For the real mix, buy &quot;The Best of ZZ Top&quot;.  This older hits collection has many other ZZ Top hits that are missing from &quot;Greatest Hits&quot;, including &quot;Waitin' for the Bus&quot;, &quot;Jesus just left Chicago&quot;, &quot;Just got Paid&quot;, &quot;Beer Drinkers and Hell Raisers&quot;, and &quot;Heard it on the X&quot;.
B00005J6UP|5.0|I saw Goonies in the theatre at least 10 times during its initial run. I then watched it on video a few thousand more times. Now, 16 years after first seeing it, I now have the Goonies on DVD, and I must say it is a great disc.<BR>First off the deleted scenes. I have been waiting forever to see the infamous octopus scene. Well it sucked, but only through this great DVD was I able to finally see it. Most of the cut scenes were cut for a reason (they were bad) but it is fun to see them anyways, and some of them fill in some of the gaps found when watching the finished movie.<BR>The great thing about this disc is the commentary. Instead of just a audio commentary with a director and a few actors, the makers of the disc got all the original Goonies, and director Richard Donner, to do a video commentary. So while you watch the movie, you also see all the Goonies, all grown up, talk about the film and have fun while they relive the time they spent together while they were filming it. I just wish Corey \\"Mouth\\" Feldman could have shut up for at least two seconds during it!<BR>All in all a great DVD for a classic movie. Buy it already! Oh and you get the Cindy Lauper music video too! Where else can you see Captain Lou Albano and the gang these days?
B00003W8NM|5.0|This is easily one of the best movies I've ever seen.  It's visually impressive (top-notch job by Fincher); Norton, Pitt, and Carter are great; and then the story itself is original on the point of genius (...I'm sure everyone has a different, heated opinion on that).<br />Most of the complaints I've seen posted are either that Fight Club is too 'pretentious' or violent.  First, the 'moral overtones' are not that didactic; sure, Tyler rants quite a bit...but you can take it or leave it.  Think of the movie as a case study of the self-destructive/fascist revolutionary mindset.  Also, the tone is lightened quite a bit by the 'dark' comedy present throughout.<br />Next: the violence in this movie is not that extensive.  Some scenes happen to be intense, but are below the level of violence talked about in the daily news.  Don't think you're going to watch a Disney flick: it's not.  But it's sure-fire not as violent as most hollywood tripe.  One person dies... several fist-fights.<br />Anyway, just watch it with an open mind.  And realize it is, to a great extent, a satire of both our consumer culture AND nihilism.
B00005RFQ5|5.0|It seems that Prince want to bring you a Gospel-like album with &quot;Rainbow Childern&quot; without getting preachy. But that is not the case.<br />This album was like going to a broadway play in New York City. You can close your eyes and experience the music coming to life in your mind.<br />The music alone is mind-blowing! My personal favorite is Digital Garden and Mellow. Yet all the tracks are good. I notice there are a total of 14 tracks but really there are &quot;7&quot; hidden tracks on here as well.<br />You may not agree with his news view as a result of his Jevovah's Witness. But that should not stop you from buying  and enjoying this album<br />This is one of his best work since &quot;Purple Rain&quot;<br />He keep setting his own trend and continue to raise the bar of standard in the music business. He is still untouchable!<br />Buy this album and you will enjoy it tremendously!!!
0446608955|5.0|I'm a 46 year old male teacher at an all boys Catholic high school and was given the book by a parent of a student. It was an easy read, it took me only three nights. I was deeply moved by this book.<BR>I don't know if it would have the same affect on high school students as it did with me but I want to try it with them. Nicholas Sparks is able to draw the reader into the love of God as well as anyone. It brought tears to my eyes. It's a great Christmas story!
B00005OM4N|4.0|Ok so this is Britney's best album yet! I think it's far above OOPS!.. in terms of production and Britney herself,who sounds great on these new tracks:<br />1) I'M A SLAVE 4 U -- 9/10 love the Neptunes,love Britney,brilliant calloboration!<br />2) OVERPROTECTED -- 9/10 first of the old skool Britney tunes. It's good,not AMAZING in a new-direction sorta way, but better than anything on OOPS..... nice beat to it.<br />3) LONELY --  7/10 good Darkchild track,better than what he's been doing recently.<br />4) NOT A GIRL... -- 7/10 soon to be released 2nd single that Dido wrote for her, and only one of 2 slow tracks on the album. Not as good as &quot;WHEN I FOUND YOU&quot; but nice.Britney sings this one really well.<br />5) BOYS -- 8/10 another Neptunes track, funky beat,but not as good as their other work ( see Kelis' new album WONDERLAND for their best work )<br />6) ANTICIPATING -- 8/10 retro disco tune, kinda Janet-esque,but not in a bad way :-)<br />7) I LOVE ROCK &amp; ROLL -- 7/10 Darkchild cover of some old 70's song. i don't know the original,but i like this!<br />8) CINDERELLA -- 10/10 my fav old skool Britney track on this album!! So much better than oops,stronger, lucky etc.<br />9) LET ME BE -- 8/10 the best Darkchild song on this album. it's also on the soundtrack to ON THE LINE.<br />10) BOMBASTIC LOVE -- 6/10 probably the worst track on the <BR>album,but it ain't terrible. sounds ok when ya take the album as a whole,but single this one out,and it's the weakest.<br />11) THAT'S WHERE YOU TAKE ME -- 9/10 cool garage tune,cool beat,britney sounds great!<br />12) WHEN I FOUND YOU -- 10/10 gorgeous ballad,one of her best <BR>songs EVER!! she sounds outstanding on this track!<br />13) BEFORE THE GOODBYE -- 9/10 BT-produced dance track. really <BR>british dance chart number. Very cool!<br />14) WHAT IT'S LIKE TO BE ME -- 8/10 Justin &amp; Britney duet,sorta. ain't no ballad! groovy track,could almost be an 'NSYNC number,but britney makes this her own.<br />OVERALL-- 8/10 definitely her best work! better producers,better songs,better vocally! <br />&quot;Britney&quot; by Britney Spears<BR>&quot;Celebrity&quot; by Nsync            these 3 are the best POP albums<BR>&quot;Mandy Moore&quot; by Mandy Moore        of the year!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
0385505833|4.0|Everyone who gets caught up in all the hype and trappings of Christmas should read this enjoyable story. I plan on reading it every year before the holiday frenzy starts.
B00005QIPH|5.0|Music these days doesn't really give a hopeful feeling does it?<BR>But Is This It? by The Strokes gives you an inside look at what music, especially rock, should be. Besides having pretty amazing vocals, interesting and colorful lyrics, striking rythms and tunes that will never leave your head, they have a certian raw and honest quality. They have a rich and vibrant ability to make a song be more than just a catchy tune, and the songs might actually mean something to you. My favorite songs are Is This It, Soma, and When it Started, but every song is incredible. In some ways, this album is everything it should be, but in some ways, it leaves you wondering 'what happens next'? The lyrics leave nothing to be desired. When you hear some of them, it's almost like insight into someone else's mind. All in all, this album was worth every penny and more.   <br />Forget the media.<BR>Forget your past perceptions of rock.<BR>Forget what you've heard.<BR>You should honestly give this album a chance.
B00005RIKD|1.0|This is an awful CD, unless you want &quot;jazz lite&quot; which is what Sting's music has become. It just meanders emotionlessly from track to track, sounding more smug and self-congratulatory with each passing minute.<br />Do not, under any circumstances, waste your money on this dog of a CD.
B000002LE6|5.0|LOVESEXY is an all-out funk assault, aimed squarely at the dancefloor. The elaborate, genre-crossing arrangements of PURPLE RAIN give way to an irresistibly propulsive dance-funk-rock aesthetic. Basic, primal rhythms, gritty sax and chattering, funky rhythm guitar help drive the long, foot-moving tunes. As usual, the lyrics tend toward the carnal, and as dance-oriented an album as LOVESEXY, that lascivious sensibility just helps to push the whole thing along. The romantic ballad &quot;When 2 R In Love&quot; provides an effective change of pace, but don't expect to sit down for long once LOVESEXY gets underway. LOVESEXY, in my opinion, is Prince at his best. This stirring collection of spiritual music, is a treat for the ears. The album is all one track, nine songs all in one track, so you don't skip around. But I don't mind listening to the whole 45 minute track, its a pure classic album. This is by far my favorite Prince album in his catalog.
B00005QK3W|3.0|after slowly getting into &quot;Flamming Pie&quot; this Album is  not on par.very Run of th emill Production,Arrangements&amp;Instrumentation here.Paul Vocally is alright but this Album on a whole seems like a By the numbers for the Most part.it has some Moments but overall it's Slightly Better than Average to Me.
B000002N1E|5.0|&quot;Don't worry about my name, it's too long to remember,&quot; he raps on &quot;Now,&quot; a rockin' hip-hop dance number that also directs us to not think too hard about the past. OK, we'll take the bait. The name doesn't matter, the persona doesn't matter, the reputation doesn't matter. Thefemale cyber-voice that shows up between several tracks on THE GOLD EXPERIENCE to narrate our trip through a faux-interactive world of various sensory experiences? Doesn't matter either.<br />This is all about music--adventurously funky ensemble music with a tighter-than-ever New Power Generation, psychedelically poppy studio music from within the man's ever-scheming head. Hip-hop-styled beats boom (&quot;Now&quot; has a grandstand-chant beat that Naughty By Nature would love), space-age keyboards squiggle (through big-beat numbers like &quot;P Control&quot;), and fuzz guitars grind out super-funky rhythms (like &quot;Shy,&quot; which pays a debt to Sly Stone). Meanwhile, the man himself stretches his supple voice like an elastic band around falsetto soul, psychedelic rock and enough playful raps to convince you he finally actually believes in the stuff, making THE GOLD EXPERIENCE the most musically realized album what's-his-name has made in the NPG era.<br />In keeping with that symbol of his, which combines maleness and femaleness, THE GOLD EXPERIENCE salutes a gender that, in the past, this same certain someone often asked to bow down and salute him. It finally puts the devotional 1994 pop ballad &quot;The Most Beautiful Girl In The World&quot; on a proper album. &quot;P Control&quot; pays respect to a strong, smart woman. And the album ends with &quot;Gold,&quot; a soaring paean to personal growth and a rejection of nihilism in all its forms. This is Prince's gospel, and with its bright keyboard chords, acoustic-guitar rhythm and na-na-na ending, it may just be his&quot;Hey Jude,&quot; too.
B00005RFQ5|3.0|yeah this is the First all New Album with the Name Prince on the Cover in ages it seems.Funny Ha ha.anyway the music Here:well The Man Can Still Play.no doubt there.tight Bass Parts,Guitar&amp;Keyboard Parts.Cool Drumming from John Blackwell.the Horns are alright in places.this Album is like a Broadway Musical Meeting Pop Music.the knocks:Still No Song Structure at all really.interesting lyrics but let's be real when was the Last time Prince knocked any one over with His Lyrical Content??Over-Produced in spots.He still Overplays Songs.&quot;1+1=3&quot; would Have worked if not touched up so much.&quot;She Loves Me 4 Me&quot; is cool.the only Song that is Edited Properly.that's one of His Biggest Problems Songs are To Drawn Out&amp;Played out.the other Major Knock Here is no Catchy Pop Song.in fact can you name the Last Catchy Pop Song Prince wrote??this Guy Once Boasted in Rolling Stone that Composing a Pop Song was Easy well 10 Years Later still Waiting??The Man still Has Chops but I Think He needs a New Sound to Combine His.He is Missing Edge&amp;is Predictable in alot of ways.I'd say this Album is a 2&amp;Half to a 3 Simply for His Music Talent as a Player but as far as Songs Go He has lost that it.Vocally His Voice has moments but not solid.I think the Solo's were cool in spots but this Whole Concept what He is Preaching Just doesn't add anything to Him.as a Composer He seems Chained to Me.
B000002L68|5.0|A soundtrack to a movie so appalling that it is infinitely wiser to let the record stand on its own merits. PURPLE RAIN is among many of Prince's finest works to date. The album has a wide variety of songs that fit the movie perfectly, and are irresistible to listeners. The biggest standout for me is the poignant &quot;The Beautiful Ones&quot;, excellent song with good synthesizers and great vocals, definately one of my all time favorite Prince songs. &quot;When Doves Cry&quot; and &quot;I Would Die 4 U&quot; are also great jams, definately among his better songs. The album works well because the songs lead into each other in such a way, and it all climaxes to the last song, the title track &quot;Purple Rain&quot;. This song, running at over 8 minutes, is an instant classic by Prince, it has stood the test of time, a true masterpiece. This is among his strongest work in his catalog, with something to please everyone. Definately has got to be in your collection, truly essential.
B000021YQV|5.0|I have just recieved my Toxicity disc from Amazon, and WOW! I am totally blown away by this band!!  If you are a metal fan in the least, I highly recommend this group.  From beginning to end it is non-stop thrash! Buy this disc.....NOW...What the heck are you waiting for?????
0684847817|5.0|I know that this book is &quot;a bit&quot; pricey, I wasn't sure if I should buy it or not, but after i did - I was so happy I didn't leave it in the store!!!<br />The minute I started reading this book, I couldn't get myself to stop. Though Froud is a better painter than he is a writer, the explanations attached to each faery are interesting, and the pictures in this book are ones I'd like framed on my wall!
B00005AQGH|5.0|Words cannot explain the vibe this CD kicks into. The 7 Day Theory has a sound that no other 2pac (or in this case, Makaveli) album has had. It has been in my Walkman for three months now and I still don't have any intentions to take it out. <BR> <BR>I like this album more than I like All Eyez On Me. The reason was that pretty much every track All Eyez on me was about being `rider.' Don't get me wrong. \\"California Love\\" and \\"All `Bout U\\" are both awesome tracks, but they don't really say much in the context of it all. I want to hear Pac talk about issues that happen in the streets every day; issues that everyone else is scared to address. Hearing him talk about mixing two or three drinks together for the sake of getting loaded is great for a couple of songs, but it gets old after awhile.<br />There are of course, the three singles from the CD. They are \\"Toss It Up\\", \\"Hail Mary\\" and \\"2 Live And Die In LA .\\" For those who haven't heard them: <br />\\"Hail Mary\\" is a song that is hard to explain. It has a really simple, but cool sounding beat to it, and really creepy lyrics. <br />The next single is called \\"Toss It Up.\\" Need I explain more?<br />\\"2 Live And Die In LA\\" is pretty much \\"California Love II\\" It's a bit more laid back and `Pac talks about life in the city he grew up in, (Hence, the title)<br /> The song that stood out the most for me was \\"Krazy.\\"  Another reviewer pointed this out before: it shows a much more mature Pac through his lyrics.  (\\"{You} don't have to bump this/ but please respect it... Hennessey {has} got me feeling bad/ Time to stop drinking.\\") The song features a cameo verse from Bad Azz. It doesn't feel like an inclusion on the song at all, like most tracks featuring Tha Outlawz seem to be.  The laid back voice of Bad Azz matches with the beat so perfectly, it actually adds on to the songs message.<br />Any fan of any kind of rap should definitely buy this. I know you will love it as much as I do; and I know it will be in your CD player for months at a time. I promise.
B00003CXE7|5.0|Gladiator opens with a captivating and impressively filmed first scene.  The acting never fails throughout the film, from the first scene to the last.  Joaquin Phoenix supported Crowe superbly, and kept the movie rolling steadily without lagging in any place.  The DVD also has a well done documentery on the topic of actual gladiators.  Also included on the specials is the making of &quot;Gladiator&quot;.  The acting is captivating, and excellent, the special effects also excellent.  Russell Crowe deserves every bit of praise he has recieved.<BR>-Ollwerther '01
B00005QZWI|3.0|My initial review of Howard Shore's soundtrack to \\"The Lord Of The Rings: The Fellowship Of The Ring\\" was written after I had listened to the soundtrack several times, but before I had seen the movie (as it had yet to be released), and was perhaps too critical. After having seen the film and hearing how the music interacted with the scenes to which it accompanies, I have much more respect for this score, and actually really love some of the passages contained within, e.g. \\"Many Meetings\\", \\"The Shadow Of The Past\\". However, I'm still disappointed with the lack of musical themes--(with all the characters involved in the story one would hope that Howard Shore would have written themes for the primary characters, or at least have been encouraged to do so.) The biggest disappointment is that there is no \\"The Lord Of The Rings\\" theme in the film or on the soundtrack. Shore does create a theme for Aragorn and Arwen, with the vocal talent of Enya, but it completely contradicts what a theme is supposed to be: identifiable. There are some brief passages that represent Saruman's Orcs, The Black Riders, and The Fellowship, but basically the only notable theme standing out in the score is that for The Hobbits--which, because of their large presence and importance in the story, makes perfect sense. Unfortunately, the Hobbits' theme sounds like a cross between rural Irish folk music and an American Western movie love theme. Needless to say, the theme is fitting, but it has a sickening sentimentality to it. They're Hobbits, for Tolkien's sake, not Irish Ewoks!<br />The music, all tracks of which are in cronological order, is a combination of orchestra and chorus, as well as both unaccompanied. There is a great deal of dynamics throughout, but mainly the score is ominous and bombastic. The general mood is cold and pessimistic, but at times (e.g. \\"Many Meetings\\") is also sublime, hinting on the styles of early Romantic and Impressionist composers. The chorus passages and orchestrations are all too reminiscent of Basil Poledouris' score for \\"Conan, The Barbarian\\", James Horner's \\"Krull\\", parts of Carl Orff's \\"Carmina Burana\\", and John Williams' \\"Duel Of The Fates\\" from \\"Star Wars: A Phantom Menace\\" for me to accept this score as anything short of derivative. However the music, for the most part, works well in the film and brings out the intended emotion and tension. But I can't ignore feeling and thinking that Shore's score would've captured the feeling of certain scenes better if the music had been more subtle. Perhaps if Peter Jackson focused more on Tolkien's literature, rather than concentrating on battle scenes and violence, Howard Shore would have been able to show us that he is capable of much, much more.<br />Basically, if you're a fan of The Fellowship Of The Ring and you liked what you heard in the film, this soundtrack won't disappoint as it will remind you of the cinematic journey you experienced. Be warned: you may find yourself running to the volume control on your stereo now and again, should you have the music turned up loud.
0385505833|5.0|A really funny book - a good laugh at how ridiculous we can be during the Holidays - So many laughs with a beautiful Chirstmas ending - Would be a great movie starring Chevy Chase!!!
6305841861|5.0|This movie just plain kicked arse.  It's not really horror, and it's not really a comedy.  The only way to really categorize it is with the term Bruce Campbell himself invented: &quot;splatstick.&quot;  Evil Dead 2 is the perfect mix between horror and comedy (though it focuses mainly on the laughs).  It was drop dead hilarious, and was jammed pack with so much classic material that it's been ripped off ever since (case in point: Idle Hands is a 2 hour rip off of 15 minutes of this movie).  This movie's awesome, and it gets better every time I see it, so enlighten yourself and buy it.  The only thing you have to keep in mind is that when you watch it, you have to do so with a lighthearted attitude; don't expect everything to make sense, just enjoy it.<br />Just wanted to clear up one thing, this movie is NOT, despite many claims otherwise, a remake.  It's a sequel.  To those who think it's a remake: the reason the beginning seems like the first one is because the people who made it couldn't get a hold of footage from the first one (some kind of legal problem) to do a recap, so they had to condense and re-film the events of the first picture.  If you watch closely, about 5 minutes through you see the last shot of the first film, ending the recap and therefore starting the sequel.
B00005RFAI|5.0|She has decided she is to talented for that Destinys child, Mya, TLC kind of R&amp;B. and there is nothing wrong with that. I am a open minded music listener. If you are not open minded then don't look here. The wierdest thing about this Cd is that it can't be put in a label, you can't just say this is this or that. She has a lot (A LOT) of flavor on here. And she also co writes so that helps. Get it for a good listen, I reccomend it.
B00005R2M3|3.0|I love Shakira and I have her first 2 albums in which I liked almost every song. I like her style and the way she mixes different rhythms and her peculiar voice, not to mention the fact that she writes all or most of her songs. However, in English &quot;Laundry Service&quot; doesn't show all that. I love &quot;Ojos asi&quot; (the Spanish and original version of &quot;Eyes like yours&quot;), the translation to English was done I think by Gloria Estefan and it doesn't flow the same way. However, I have to give her a big credit for not just singing in another language but composing in another language which is tremendously difficult. I feel that the production of &quot;Laundry Service&quot; might have been rushed a little bit. She is a complete artist and I think with time she will shine in all her splendor. Don't take me wrong, I still like this album I just think it could have been better.
6304806434|1.0|This film is beyond dumb; it is stupefying; it features what is perhaps the worst performance by an already overrated actor, Nick Cage (who does his tank-topped best to make us forget how awful he was in &quot;Firebirds&quot;); watch the thing for Steve Buscemi; no, don't; I like Steve Buscemi; but let's enjoy him in a literate film like &quot;Fargo&quot;; now, down to business -- &quot;Con Air&quot; is the good old prison break movie recycled to include every known psycho and psychotic type jammed into a cargo plane and headed for Disney World where they will barbecue Goofy and Minnie . . . ooops, wrong movie; scratch the Disney World stuff; anyway, Psychos-R-Us are airborne when wham! everything falls apart and the world as we know it is about to end 'cause John Malkovich as head psycho figures he's going to reroute his sicko crew to &quot;Armageddon&quot; where they will kill off Bruce Willis and Ben Affleck (for acting without expression) and let the &quot;good hands&quot; comet destroy earth; nope, that's not it; OK, OK, OK, these cons are up to less than no good, they land the plane on a cheap desert set where John Cusack (who is years away from &quot;Being John Malkovitch&quot;) single-handedly routs them with a stolen Corvette until the cavalry shows up and everyone dies; I fell asleep often while watching this film; I think that's helpful.  I woke up happy.
6303430570|4.0|...boy, ain't THAT the truth! Being a comic-book / Stars Wars geek , Kevin Smith's movies are pretty much required viewing for me and my ilk. Although I loved \\"Chasing Amy\\" the most, my past experiences as a till jockey (at a comic book &amp; collectibles shop, no less!) makes \\"Clerks\\" the Smith-flick I identify with the most. <br />Thanks (or rather, NO thanks) to my misadventures in the retail trade, I can really relate to Dante &amp; Randall as they spend their respective shifts dealing with rude, obnoxious, and just-plain-weird customers &amp; hangers-on as well as their own boredom during lulls in the action. I especially enjoyed Randall's attitude of indifference &amp; apathy, and his rude &amp; smart-alecky behavior towards the video store patrons he rings up. There were times when I wanted to do the exact same things to the more unsavory regulars that'd pop up at the shop I worked at! Unfortunately, the boss was almost always present, so I had to watch myself or I'd be lectured about \\"not alienating the big-spender customers with my attitude problem\\" or some such nonsense. <br />But I digress. Being a fairly ardent Star Wars aficionado, I found Randall's attempt to put the builders of the Death Stars into a real-world perspective quite entertaining. Who knew there were independent contractors and labor unions in a galaxy far, far away? Then there's the rooftop street-hockey game, our heroes' all-too-brief paying of their respects to a dearly departed ex-girlfriend, one young woman's catatonic-state-inducing experience (a moment that will be referred to in \\"Chasing Amy\\"), and a bunch of other stuff I can't really put into words `cuz it's pretty raw. Besides, you wouldn't want me to give everything away and ruin the magic of the movie, would ya?<br />`Late!
6305127689|3.0|Oh yeah; the jets roar, the top gun aces sass and swagger and the script trips and plops out such memorable quoters as: &quot;you can be my wing man anytime&quot; . . . (right up there with Kirk Douglas's Spartacus snarling at Crassus' legions: &quot;they can't stop men who wan't to be free&quot;, etc.); well, news is, they can stop men who want to be free; they can do that by casting Kelly McGillis up against the very short Tom Cruise (Maverick); they can hope for something like charisma, sexual tension, animal magnetism or just good ole fashion' lust on the tarmac; but, no dice; it just don't happen; the best (and only) love affair in this hot-to-be-liked Tony Scott film is that between tiny Tom and Anthony Edwards (E.R.'s favorite bald surgeon); oh, yeah -- those two bohunks click; as does Val Kilmer's Iceman -- the nerves of steel by the books hot shot who will probably wind up marrying Ollie North's daughter and running for Congress (note: please, do not let me see him wearing towel only ever again -- his is a torso only Ben Kingsley in Gandhi outdoes); but back to Top Gun; yes, that's Meg Ryan as Anthony Edwards' wife/widow; it is one of her best parts; you can almost like her; Tom Skerritt, who is never forgettable in any part, looks as if he wishes his mustache were on Tom Cruise (who, if he had a mustache, might look old enough to sign up for his own paper route); Michael Ironside doesn't know if Cruise/Maverick will ever shape into the ace of aces we all know he has to become if the film is to end; and end it does; all is well in the azure skies of freedom and at Top Gun school in Miramar, CA; the juke box plays &quot;You've Lost That Lovin Feelin'&quot; as Kelly and Tom reunite; I hope they don't have kids; or, if they do, the kids avoid this movie; just kidding; there are great aerial scenes and then there are great landing and take-off scenes; I like the jet trails too; and the overplayed Berlin song, &quot;Take My Breath Away&quot;, which should have been bought up by Certs or Listerine or a Mexican Restaurant chain; oh well, there is no irony in popular movies any more; wait for the trading cards.
B00003CXXJ|3.0|SHREK is visually impressive and very commercial (commercial is not bad because movies need to make money), which makes it a typical Dreamworks effort. The same things may be said about GLADIATOR and AMERICAN BEAUTY. But like those two Oscar(tm) winners, SHREK is also very limited. The storyline is weak. Trash-talkin' Disney (like the grafting of teenage heads on the nude bodies of adult women in BEAUTY) may be bold and innovative, but it will not make for an all-time classic film. The use of brash contemporary music was a staple of animation even in the 1930s, nothing new about that, but Disney always seems to come up with original and Oscar winning songs for their features. Dreamworks takes the easy way out, though I did like the Hallelujah song. As far as the SHREK'S DANCE PARTY animation, even in 1940 with FANTASIA, Disney showed that by putting dancing animated characters slightly out of step with each other the effect is more realistic. Dreamworks goes with the lockstep mechanical look. SHREK is &quot;close, but not Cewpie doll!&quot;<br />And what I really hate most about this film is that the Donkey very closely resembles my dearly departed dog (Jack Russell terrier) in shape, manner, and attitude. Props to Dreamworks on the realism there, but it's kinda painful for me to watch.

B00000DHR0|5.0|Celine Dion's \\"These Are Special Times\\" could be considered her greatest, and perhaps one of the finest Christmas albums ever released.  It is one of those CD's that gets you into the spirit of the holidays.  With timeless classics like \\"The Christmas Song\\" and \\"O Holy Night,\\" there is you need.  <BR> One of the most compelling things on this album is Celine Dion's magnificent voice.  It has never sounded better and if that is not enough, guests are featured on the album as well.  R. Kelly, Andrea Bocelli, and even Celine's own family sing along in different songs such as \\"You Are My Angel\\" and \\"Feliz Navidad.\\"   <BR> Even if you are not a Celine Dion fan, this is a CD that you should have in your collection.  You can tell by the cover that this a soothing album with lots of heart.  It's a good one to keep around to help take off that edge you get waiting for Christmas to arrive.
0316921173|3.0|A friend saw me reading this novel and said &quot;Let me guess, the joke's on you.&quot;  By the time I finished it, I almost agreed with him.  I can tell the author is talented, but this book needed a lot of editing.  The main reason I don't give the book a higher rating is that the footnotes on the endnotes was just too much.
B00000K3CR|3.0|This movie's pretty good, considering it's a Tom Hanks flick.  The story is quite charming, and the rendition of &quot;Heart and Soul&quot; on the big floor keyboard is one of the most memorable movie moments of all-time.  This is probably the best Hanks movie ever; and it's certainly his best role.  If you like him, you'll love this movie.
6303269826|5.0|I don't know why this movie hasn't caught on.  I is a great story about Wyatt Earps life.  If you like Tombstone then you will like this movie.  This movie hasn't recieved the recognition that it deserves.
B00005M91K|5.0|I will not attempt to extol the virtues film itself (what more can I say than has already been said?), but of the new collector's edition:  I too have the original DVD release, and the VHS release.  This new transfer is AMAZING, and is exactly what the first DVD release should have been...  PRISTINE video (very few artifacts, little or no pixelation), and IMMACULATE audio (crisp, clean, and great presence without sounding &quot;over-processed&quot;).  If you have both versions and can't tell the difference, then it's time to watch it on a large screen TV, and clean yer ears out!  The improvements are painfully obvious.  This is a truly incredible film, and finally justice has been done with the fantastic quality of the consumer version.  Like someone else said, give your old copy away, and BUY THIS VERSION now!  I'm glad I picked it up, and you will be too.
B00003CX5A|5.0|When I was younger, &quot;The Legend Of Sleepy Hollow&quot; was my favorite bedtime story and Disney movie. Here it comes to life with a brilliant twisted director Tim Burton, (Beetlejuice, Edward Scissor Hands, Nightmare Before Christmas) as he puts his own dark but beautiful style into this art. Scenery is very beautiful and realisitic, along with the brilliant acting performances from Johnny Depp, Christina Ricci, Christopher Walken, Miranda Richardson and more. Contains some disturbing images with gore and blood which fits great into the movie. This is definitely the best Tim Burton movie to date. The eerie and suspensful dark forest is a great touch, along with all the other sets: Church, Windmill, Cave, Town, and the creepy tree of the dead, where the headless horseman keeps his victims' heads. This DVD however, has a boring uninteractive menu, with hardly any bonus features, so I suggest waiting, if you truely love this movie, for a more packed DVD. Breathtaking special effects and acting make this movie a gem for all movie collectors!!!
B000002J03|5.0|LED ZEPPELIN II is more than just a group's second album. It's also much more than a blues record. It's bold and innovative; some people say that art-rock is to SGT. PEPPER, ARE YOU EXPERIENCED is to jazz-like rock, as NEVER MIND THE BOLLOCKS is to punk, but LED ZEPPELIN II is to heavy metal. Metal didn't become a commercial mainstream until the mid-80s, but in 1969, Led Zeppelin was playing the music like the back of their hand. It's also somewhat of a pleasant surprise that few metal bands, imitators or not, could photocopy their sound.<br />LED ZEPPELIN II happened because of an accident. It was entirely unintentional. Since the band was touring constantly, they couldn't work in the studio very often. So LED ZEPPELIN II has sort of a rushed feel to it, and more than half the songs range from blues jams (&quot;The Lemon Song&quot;) to simply traditional blues tunes put into the band's own words (&quot;Whole Lotta Love,&quot; &quot;Heartbreaker,&quot; and especially &quot;Bring it on Home,&quot;). For most bands, this lack of original material would cripple an album, but it only managed to make LED ZEPPELIN II dirtier, meaner, grimier, more dangerous and (most importantly) better.<br />The quality of LED ZEPPELIN II is no less than excellent, and apart from the Bonham drum solo &quot;Moby Dick,&quot; each song has strong hooks. The album's opener, &quot;Whole Lotta Love,&quot; with its distortion-drenched guitar, took blues to new heights, and proved that the blues would never be the same again. Plant's &quot;What is and What Should Never Be,&quot; escalates from quiet, giggly verses to bitterly declarative choruses. &quot;The Lemon Song,&quot; while only a reworked blues jam, has a memorable opening riff with plenty of raunchy solos and lyrics (&quot;The way you squeezed my lemon, I fall right out of bed/ The juice runs down my leg&quot;). &quot;Heartbreaker&quot; is a perfect vehicle for Jimmy Page's virtuosity with a Hendrix-like guitar solo.<br />Led Zeppelin was never big on ballads, but &quot;Thank You&quot; certainly is one, and arguably one of the band's best. Although Robert Plant's voice is noticeably not suited for this type of music, its graceful acoustic guitars and John Paul Jones's organ do manage to lighten the album's mood. &quot;Living Loving Maid (She's Just a Woman),&quot; is an extremely fun rocker and its riff manages to strike a chord inside you and get you going. &quot;Ramble On&quot; blends acoustic and electric guitars seamlessly, also blending folk and hard rock in the process. And finally, closing LED ZEPPELIN II is &quot;Bring it on Home,&quot; its intro and closing heavily blues influenced, with Plant blowing away on a harmonica.<br />LED ZEPPELIN II would not have been as great if it had been given more time in the studio, such as LED ZEPPELIN IV and LED ZEPPELIN III. But what really makes this album work so well is its raw rock 'n roll feel, unmatched in the rest of band's  catalog.
B00004SZWD|5.0|I grew up listening to this album.  From as early as I can remember, when my dad actually taught me how to use the record player, I would listen to this.  It's absolutely brilliant from start to finish.  Songs such as &quot;Sir Duke&quot; and &quot;I Wish&quot; are enormously popular, or were, and still should be.  I absolutely love the Zappa-esque &quot;Contusion&quot; and things like &quot;Ordinary Pain&quot; and &quot;As&quot; are so completely heart-felt and true, that's it's impossible to compare it to something else.  This is definately the absolute Holy Grail of Stevie Wonder's career and something that every musician who takes themselves seriously should strive to achieve.  If you don't own this, you are cheating yourself.  Buy it now and overnite express ship it.  You will NOT be sorry.
B000059QYB|2.0|I love Billy Idol as much as anyone but I refuse to buy yet another re-packaging of his work. Why? Because as long as we keep shelling out money for stuff he did twenty years ago, he doesn't have to release any new material! Apparently that's not all his fault because he's been getting bounced around from major labels. Hopefully he'll come to his senses and sign with an Indie label who will take him seriously. If I sound angry folks, it's because I also just shelled out good money for the Rebel Yell &quot;Re-master&quot; which was a royal rip-off! So go ahead and buy this if you want to let Billy continue to waste his talent. But if you want to send a message that it's time (after 8 years!) for new music than wait for him to earn your money. Come on Billy, get back with Steve Stevens and re-claim your place in Rock! If he would go back to his mid-80's sound he could be huge again. THEN maybe it would be more appropriate to release a Greatest Hits. As far as collection of songs, well that's worthy of 5 stars, but then we knew that when Reagan was still President.
B00004WIBW|3.0|Johnny Depp is good as always, but his character is very uneven. Am I the only one who noticed that? For example, he starts off very confident in the opening scene and seems to be brave, but for the rest of the movie it's as if he's someone else. Even more surprising is that a mortician would always be so shocked and horrified at the site of gory bodies! (Wasn't Ichabod Crane a school teacher in the original? That would have made more sense in this version too.) The only thing that saves this one from getting one star is that visually it's very good. Fantastic photography! This is classic &quot;style over substance&quot; as in most of Burton's films. There are fantastic sets and Burton's trademark style of imagery make it very watchable. I guess my biggest disappointment was it's just not scary. Also the plot gets way too thick towards the end and by then you don't care anymore who gets their head chopped off. Tim Burton must pick movies based on the potential for visually exciting sets than for the story or script. That would explain awful films like Batman and Edward Scissorhands. There were some unintentially funny moments too. Particularly the scenes in which Depp is shocked over and over. You would think after seeing lots of bizarre things, he'd be a little desensitized to it all. Oh well. It was worth a look anyway. If you want to see a much better Tim Burton/Johnny Depp film, then check out &quot;Ed Wood&quot;.
B00005QXXO|5.0|...it leaves you wanting more. It's a cliche, sure, and with only eight tracks Radiohead fans would be guaranteed to be a bit peeved. But it's still incredible music on this disc: &quot;I Might Be Wrong&quot; is fast and furious, &quot;Like Spinning Plates&quot; trades electronic noise for a delicate piano backing perfect for Thom Yorke's soaring voice (how often has THAT adjective been used for Thom Yorke's voice, anyway?), and &quot;True Love Waits&quot; is the perfect ending, a beautiful guitar-based ballad. This is as close as we might ever get to a true live Radiohead album, and the amount of care put in the song selection bears this further. So since we've got it, enjoy it in all it's glory.<br />By the way, it's &quot;Fake Plastic Trees&quot;, not &quot;Little Plastic Trees&quot;.

6301735048|1.0|A mess of a movie.  <br />A plodding first hour leads to an affair between Kevin Costner (our hero and, coincidentally the producer of the film) and Madeliene Stowe.  Unfortunately Ms Stowe is the clueless wife of Anthony Quinn, a wealthy Mexican crime kingpin.  They're caught and Quinn exacts brutal revenge on Costner and Stowe.  The rest of the movie is about Costner's search for his own revenge.<br />Unnecessary characters are introduced and dropped.  For example, Costner's Navy buddy, a dying cowboy, a rock singer.  Plot errors and gaps litter the film.  For example, Costner's character can speak Spanish in the beginning, but not in the end.  <br />*SPOILER* Eventually Costner learns Stowe had been sent by Quinn to a whorehouse.  But somehow he finds her in a convent in a coma.  She wakes up, sees Kevin and dies.  At least she got out of the movie.  For the audience there was no way out.
B00004W5UA|5.0|i, at first, didn't want to see this movie. I thought it was going to be a macho movie about guys beating eachother up. it was NOTHING like that at all. i finally saw it, and it's one of my all time favorites. Fight Club is amazing...the way it's filmed, edward norton's performance, the thoughts and ideas expressed, everything. I used to think brad pitt was a pretty boy model, but my view on him has changed after seeing fight club. and for all those reviewers that say this is a 'white guys movie'. i'm a girl, and i enjoyed this movie very much! it's a must see, you won't regret it!!
B000056K04|3.0|EVERYDAY, the Dave Matthews Band's newest album, like any other of the band's, is wildly inconsistent. I am not a big Dave Matthews fan, and I generally don't like some of the things he writes, or does, like his singing. But the band does have a few great songs per album, and even the excessively long-winded concerts have their moments. EVERYDAY has only a handful of wothwhile songs. &quot;I Did It&quot; is a bitter, juicy rocker with good lyrics (a rare DMB event), &quot;The Space Between&quot; is a wonderful ballad with a graceful melody, and &quot;Mother Father&quot; is also a standout with a catchy Latin beat. <br />But that's about it. The rest of the CD is either filler, or tracks of not much value. Another problem is in the new producer, Grace Ballard. The Dave Matthews Band once had a unique sound, now turned into fluff not unlike what you would hear if your turned on 93Q for a random fifty-one minutes (EVERYDAY's running length).<br />Since my friend is the biggest of the big Dave Matthews fans, he gave me a copy of what was called LILYWHITE SESSIONS he had recently burned off the Internet. The sound quality was slightly ragged, but songs such as &quot;Sweet Up &amp; Down,&quot; &quot;Grace is Gone,&quot; and &quot;Gray Street&quot; were superior to EVERYDAY's filler. I later found out that these excellent tracks were unreleased songs for an album that was to be released with their former producer Steve Lilywhite...at least before they were discarded and EVERYDAY was released in their place. Why not LILYWHITE SESSIONS and why EVERYDAY? Hopefully, the band will re-team with Lilywhite for the next album. <br />So even if EVERYDAY has its moments, it's really for diehards only.
B000001FDK|2.0|I don't know what I was thinking.  One day I had the urge to buy this album: I thought that I was somehow not fulfilling some sort of duty by not owning it.  I've never been a big fan of the film or play, but it's such a part of the culture of a certain era that I simply had to own it.  As it turns out, I was wrong: it's not a very interesting CD even as a cultural relic.
B00005RFQ5|5.0|To start with let me explain that although I am a massive Prince &quot;fan&quot; I do not think that everything he has done is good.  I will freely criticize his material if not up to standard.  Especially material over the last 10 years or so. But this is the best album he has done since Lovesexy in '88 and is up there with that release as well as SOTT and Parade and is in some ways a belated natural progression! This is THE album I have been waiting for for so long.......<br />As soon as the laser hit the disc I was pleased to hear a fully organic sound with live drums(hurrah!) and great keys rounded of with a lovely warm, deep sounding bass on the opening track.  My first reaction was that if the rest of the album sounded this good I was in for a real treat.  I was not disappointed!<br />The first majot highlight was track 4;The Work Pt1(Where are the other parts?).  A deep James Brown groove with a drum pattern to die for!  The horns added extra grease to the groove and before I knew what had hit me I was on my feet and dancing around the room.  But this is not the only funk blast on this album!  The Work is followed later by 1+1+1=3, Family Name(deep in social commentary) and the up-tempo The Everlasting Now.<br />The entire album is centred around Prince's religous and social dogma.  But don't let that put you off purchasing this album.  I myself find his &quot;God&quot; speeches over-preachy most of the time but not on this release as the music is divine.<br />Do yourself a favour, buy this album today.  If you are one of the people who thought that D'Angelo's &quot;Voodoo&quot; set was good(which it was) you really need to hear this to hear how much better it could have been.
0780631684|3.0|When a high school student's premonition of death causes several of his classmates and a teacher to narrowly avoid being killed on an exploding airplane, they gradually come to understand the rules that Death follows and attempt to avoid their own fates.  Having enjoyed Glen Morgan's and James Wong's television work on &quot;X-Files,&quot; &quot;Millennium,&quot; and &quot;Space: Above and Beyond,&quot; my expectations were high for this film.  Unfortunately, it just didn't deliver consistently enough.  Although the atmosphere was appropriately creepy, I found the premise to be quite silly and this is a flaw that is hard to bounce back from.
B00004U8H4|4.0|This film rocks!<BR>There, now thats out of the way I may begin.This is a satirical look at life in the late Eightys in greedy New York, a group of young, rich and bored men and women live there lives on a cocktail of expensive restaurants, clubs and drugs. Howerver all is not well and good within Patrick Bateman(Cristian Bale)he has developed a intense bloodlust through bordem he gets nasty with often shocking but occasionally humourous results.<BR>My advice : BUY IT AND WATCH IT TWICE
6305736650|5.0|A disillusioned nightclub owner in WWII Casablanca (Humphrey Bogart) finds himself faced with a personal crisis when the woman with whom he had a passionate love affair in pre-Occupation Paris (Ingrid Bergman) shows up with her husband, a French Resistance leader who is on the run from the Nazis.  He is placed in the position of choosing between doing what is best for himself or for the world at large.  I think everybody knows his decision since this film features the most famous good-bye scene of any movie.  After all these years, this film remains fresh.  The dialogue crackles and the cast is possibly the best ever assembled.  Rightly regarded as one of the best American films.
1857150511|5.0|A book that has a happy end, and lets you dream of long flowing dresses and dashing gentelmen!
0060392886|5.0|I wasn't a huge fan of Motley Crue (with the exception of looking at Nikki Sixx), but reading this book has turned me into a total hardcore Crue fan.  Not only is it extremely well laid out and written...it shows each person's personality and lets it all hang out....good and bad.  Trust me, you'll love this book!  I couldn't put it down.
B00004XONN|5.0|I love it when people get annoyed by intelligent movies and recordings. &quot;What's wrong with being entertained?&quot; they say. &quot;Nothing,&quot; I reply. &quot;Don't get upset because you can't be entertained by something intelligent. You're only betraying your pea-sized brain.&quot; I enjoy the Beatles' silly love songs as much as I enjoy the &quot;intelligent&quot; recordings, like Day in the Life and I am the Walrus. Relax!! Don't feel so damn intimidated. Enjoy the music for what it is--breaking all the rules and reassembling the pieces into a patchwork quilt of strange but beautiful music. This is brilliant AND entertaining music.
B00005Q66T|4.0|&quot;GHV2&quot; covers Madonna's incredible recording career since her last greatest hits set &quot;The Immaculate Collection,&quot; and it shows why she remains the most popular female recording artist of all time.  However, unlike the &quot;Immaculate Collection,&quot; &quot;GHV2&quot; has no new material, plus it excludes some really good hits such as &quot;I'll Remember,&quot; &quot;You'll See&quot; &quot;This Used to Be My Playground,&quot; and her cover of &quot;American Pie.&quot;  Despite those concerns, &quot;GHV2&quot; is an otherwise incredible journey: her transition from the &quot;Erotica&quot; era to the &quot;Music&quot; album shows her growth and maturity as an artist.  This, along with &quot;The Immaculate Collection&quot; and &quot;Something to Remember,&quot; are highly recommended for someone who's starting a collection of Madonna releases.
B000009RC2|5.0|I was Blessed to witness The original Mahavishnu Orchestra Live five times.These remasters are absolutely stunning! There is loads of Live footage of this majestic Band,and there is no doubt with anyone who got to see these guys, that they were truly one of the greatest gems, in all of music History!All Mahavishnu Family Members sure look forward to the day it will be available to the public on DVD! The Original Mahavishnu Orchestra had an enormous following,so I'm sure it's well worth it to whom ever gathers the archival footage,to release it on DVD.I'm guessing there is well over half a million of us still on earth!Mahavishnu John Mclaughlin, will remain forever one of the truly great musicians,and continues to put out the highest quality in music standards to this very day! Infinite Blessings of Love&amp; Light to all!P.S.Besides checking with Maha,you better make sure old Miami-Rice-Jan Hammer is aware of the impending release of The Orchestra of Enlightened Doom!If there is a reunion tour,I'm sure George W.would book it in the White House,after all these guys are like George Washington,Abraham Lincoln,Sitting Bull,Geronimo &amp; Edgar Cayce,total History in the making,and all the original members are still living! It's literally like having the opportunity to see Niccolo Paganini perform!
B00004TH7Z|3.0|Nice to have Bruce and Adrian back, but I am afraid that the songs on this CD are not up to par - with the exception of &quot;The Ghost Of The Navigator&quot;. I saw them play in Munich and I found the old songs to be superior. Bruce also sang some of the songs from the first Blaze Bailey CD and I think tracks from that CD like &quot;The Name Of The Rose&quot; and &quot;Falling Down&quot; are better than anything on &quot;Brave New World&quot;.<br />The track &quot;Brave New World&quot; is almost a parody of a Maiden track. You know the what I mean - title from a famous novel, repeated and repeated and repeated and repeated phrase ( in this case &quot;In A Brave New World&quot; ( can you say &quot;The Clansman&quot;? ) and then pounding dual lead guitar attack repeating riff.<br />What I want is is for them to get back to songs of the quality of &quot;The Evil That Men Do&quot;. As a big fan, I am sure they can.<br />Oh yes, I would say that Bruce's last solo album, &quot;Accident Of Birth&quot; is also better than this Maiden effort in all departments.

B000002R48|5.0|For me this is still the best CD from Dream Theater. I don't mind that they sound very much like Rush on a number of tracks. This CD has good solid tuneful songs. on their later CDs they have moved towards an even more &quot;Prog&quot; feel, with longer and longer tracks. The later CDs I like too, being a big fan of Progressive Rock, but for me, &quot;When Dreams And Day Unite&quot; is still my favorite.
0679601686|5.0|I've just finished reading this book again for probably the 20th time.  The first time I read it was in my early 20s.  I was amazed that Elizabeth, the main character, a young woman in her 20s from early 19th century England,was so likeable and full of life.  I definitely related to her.<br />Seeing the famous BBC/A&amp;E production in the mid 1990s only increased my joy of this book.<br />Austen was an incredible observer of the manners and mores of her time.  This book lets her playfulness and human spirit shine through.<br />This is one title I will never tire of reading.
B00000FYIL|5.0|Once I saw this movie, I had to get the soundtrack.  Although I'm not much of a classical music fan, the instrumentals are beautiful and relaxing and complement the movie wonderfully.
0553106635|4.0|I can't beleive people who read part of a series and even when they don't know how many books there will be they go WOW its just as good as Tolken. the Tolken series is complete and better then anything else i have read. could this be as good, eh its got a small shot wich is saying alot.<BR>Things that ... though is the lack of a big climax in any of the books. You will not finish this book and feel food about how it ended. you will instead wonder how much longer you are going to have to wait until the next book so you can see what happend. <BR>Other things that ... Ok i know Stories right themselves and you just see things happen but MY GOD STOP KILLING EVERYONE. The Red wedding shocked me cause even though there are no heros's in the book the king in the north was the guy i wanted to win. why i kept reading My favorite charecter died i don't know.<BR>Good things in this book. YOU NEVER KNOW.you get easily attached to the chars and just when you love them the most there head can and most of the time will come off. it dosn't even matter that another charecter was on a 2 book long quest to get to that char they die. You fear for your chars because they can die. <BR>Other Good things. theres good guys and bad guys but most of the good guys can do bad things (stannis) and the bad char can do good things (Hound) and even chars that did Horrible things can make you like them (Jaime)<BR>have fun reading it
0345448898|5.0|Definately a group of books for people to read (if they haven't already) as they await the fifth Harry Potter book.  Philip Pullman's series is beautiful.  It takes place both in our world and in a world like ours, but not.  The first book, The Golden Compass, takes place in this alternate world.  The second book, The Subtle Knife takes place in both, but connects these two worlds.  The final book, The Amber Spyglass, takes place in both, plus others.  It sounds confusing, but it is great.  Beware, though, that the end of the series is not like any other book that you'll ever read...
B00003CX9Q|5.0|This movie is one of the best classics of our time...unfortunately Spielberg is about to make an artistic mistake as Lucas did and add Cartoons to an already perfect movie.   I tried immediately to purchase this on DVD with the old script intact, but alas it seems the studios placed a hold on the DVD versions to be released as the 'improved' version.   Of course i'm interested to see the new effects, but at least give the audience a chance to choose between that of their childhood memories and the next generation's fad on 'almost lifelike' animation.
0792151712|5.0|Long but still really good. It has a lot of action in the end and is a huge emmy award. Kind of sad and is fun to watch. It is the best! You will never get sick of watching this flick. It was a huge dissaster and is remembered after all these years. With Rose and Jack lighting up the screen you cant go wrong. Those two love bugs are a perfect match. A lot of romance and action this movie is for YOU! Spose to be a VHS.
B00005T30L|5.0|Ghost World is that rarity-a movie which transcends the screen and keeps us fully involved the story.  The script and the acting are both spectacular and the movie looks great too.  This is an in depth character study of anyone who felt alienated in high school only to find herself more alienated after graduation--and that's most of us, right?<br />You will be fascinated and you won't want the thing to end!
0783114222|3.0|I feel other reviewers have been a little too kind to this product. My friend taped this series when it was first shown on HBO. I watched his tapes and enjoyed it very much. It aims at greatness and almost hits the target. Hanks probably told this story as well as it could be done while still maintaining historical accuracy. When I saw this on DVD at Blockbuster, I had to rent it for a second look. For me, it does not hold my interest as well the second time around. <br />Additionally, I was slightly disappointed with the DVD picture quality. I had just seen the Sex and the City first season DVD set, where the picture quality was great. The DVD of From the Earth to the Moon is definitely a step down from there. The colors seem a bit desaturated (except in special FX scenes), everything slightly defocussed, and there are often &quot;moire&quot; patterns (I think this is what they are called) in areas of the picture where there are black and white lines close to one another. The special effects scenes seem to be sharper and better looking than the normal photography. I'm not sure why. HBO should remaster this as pennance for not lavishing the care on mastering this material that it deserves. And let people trade in the first edition for the properly mastered one. <br />The package is very good. But I can't possibly give it 5 stars -- that would put it in a category with works of art like Lawrence of Arabia, or Vertigo. No, it is not THAT good -- let's be realistic. <br />And the less than stellar (no pun intended) quality of the video must take away another star. So this is how I arrived at three stars. If I was allowed, I'd give it three and a half stars. If we are to have any perspective about this video in comparison to the entire universe (again, no pun intended) of great DVDs of great films, this is a completely fair rating.

B00005RFQ5|1.0|Written as I took my first listen:<br />17:00 minutes into The Rainbow Children and amazingly enough I have to say it ain't bad --- may actually be his best since Gold Experience.  You have to deal with his spoken word theological talk at points (which actually works more than I ever thought that it would), and occasionally his lyrics talk of how his woman (Mayte) betrayed him (a little too much disingenuous self-pity a la Marvin Gaye's _Here My Dear_) but so far it really is pretty good.   <BR> <br />The praise for the 1st 1/4 of the album may have been undeserved --- the second quarter (I'm up to 37:00 out of 69:00) has been uneventful to say the least.  Adult contemporary ballad, a funk jam that begins with a promising raunchy, driving bass line but which devolves rapidly into a tepid version of &quot;2 Nigs...&quot;  (And without the squirrel meat!!)  Keeping you posted from the front, this is Wolf Blitzer...<BR> <BR>The album gets progressively worse --- at 42:00 a (thankfully) brief rock opera monstrosity (much, much, much worse than &quot;3 Chains&quot;), followed by a decent if somewhat boring adult contemporary love ballad (&quot;She Loves Me for Me&quot;?).  Next comes a strange jam with computerized voices expounding Prince's quasi-philosophical doctrines on race, religion, etc., which then leads into another funky jam, more soulful than the preceding jam, but nothing like his best (_Black Album_, etc). The album is also riddled with problematic, simplistic comments that can easily be construed as anti-Semitic (commenting on the Holocaust that its better to die than to be sold, etc.).  Then we get into the part that I simply cannot abide --- the Father and Son stuff.  No more reading into Prince's spirituality what I want to see.  He has that same &quot;my way or the highway&quot; view of religion that most other Christians have.  No thanks Prince.  &quot;This is funky but I just wish he'd play like he used to, old scraggly head---SMACK!!&quot; says the voice of Andre Crabtree at about 60:00.  God, nine more minutes of this twaddle!<BR> <BR>I think I'm on the last song now --- &quot;Last December&quot;? --- and it is an okay song, reminiscent in production at least to &quot;Joint 2 Joint&quot; (and later like &quot;3 Chains&quot; --- rock opera again) but in content it is quite different.  All about death, redemption, hope, AND of course the Father and the Son.  IF you can get past the ALL-TOO obvious Christian references (subtlety may simply be lost on Prince), the song is not too bad (not super great either, though) and like &quot;Gold&quot; it seems to be a decent way to finish off the album.  <BR> <BR>Overall review after the first listen.  File this under mediocre Christian rock-gospel.  It is an okay, but really unnecessary, album from someone who may just need to give it up.  This album is a one time listen, even for a die-hard, non-sycophantic Prince fan.  Perhaps I am being too hard on this album, judging it after only one listen.  Very possible.  I KNOW, though, that I really don't ever need to hear this again.  Too much else out there is FAR more compelling to waste anymore time on this tripe.
B0000256VK|5.0|Everything about this masterpiece is an improvement on past Roxy experiments. The overall sound is lush but alive, glossy but with a vital pulse. Lyrically the songs are more mysterious and therefore more evocative and atmospheric than the two Roxy discs that preceded it, both of which have Roxy Music trapped in musical genres which were not challenging to the players themselves or their listeners. Avalon defies any genre, it is by itself in a genre of its own. These compositons are all worked into perfection and yet the feel is still warm, inviting. Something like a miracle of studio alchemy. Andy Mackay's sax and oboe are used to beautiful effect. The live show during the 83 tour allowed him to stretch out his solos even further which made for very exciting moments during a show which finally had Roxy assimilating and making the most of all their various talents.<br />This disc is now almost twenty years old and yet I doubt they would do much differently were they to record this today. It is one of those rare phenomena, a career crowning disc that once again has a very groundbreaking group breaking new ground and setting a new standard.<br />This is a disc for all kinds of listeners. The earlier mentioned Roxy CD's though a little less impressive should not be forgotten either.<br />Flesh and Blood(80): Not as deep and rich as Avalon but some pretty accomplished soft rock nonetheless. &quot;Over You&quot;, &quot;My Only Love&quot;, and two great covers &quot;Midnight Hour&quot;, &quot;Eight Miles High&quot;.<br />Manifesto(78):Avoidable for most, unless you like &quot;Dance Away&quot; disco.<br />Siren(75): Excellent melodic pop rock. Not as elegant as Avalon but a very appealing sound of its own beginning with &quot;Love is the Drug&quot; and ending with &quot;Just Another High&quot;.<br />Country Life(74): Campy and sophisticated rock classic.
B00005J6UP|5.0|I remeber when this movie came out many years ago! And it is so Cool to have this come out on DVD.  There is no way to describe this movie except that it's allot of fun and I have watched it many times over the years. This movie is a All Time Classic and will be around for many years to come. My Grand Children will be watching this movie.
B00005QZWJ|5.0|This soundtrack is absolutely fantastic!  Howard Shore has produced a masterpiece for the movie everyone is waiting for.  I recommend this to everyone who enjoys music.  You won't be disappointed.
B00003CX8Y|5.0|I simply love this movie! I have loved this move ever since I was a young kid. I remember when it first came out in the movies. I truly admire everything about this move, the store, plot, characters, animation, their voices, and everything else! This DVD [is] a Platinum Edition like the \\"Snow White And The Seven Dwarfs\\" DVD ...and you must pick that one up as well. It is a must just like this DVD ... The DVD will have tons and tons of bonus features like Snow White. Behind the sense, deleted parts in the movie, a game to play, interviews with the voices behind the characters, and much more...I really love this movie so much! It is for kids, teens, and adults (Like Me.) ...Disney has added an addition sequence to this film. This is the only Disney movie where the original animators went back into every scene to make it crisp and clear and added an additional scene. You can see the Movie in three different versions on ONE DVD! ... This will be going down in Walt Disney history! ENJOY!
B000002B30|1.0|Bruce hits album aint all its up to be. There were many MANY great boss songs that should have made this at least a double disc album. The songs are great on here, dont get me wrong, but i think the record company did a poor job. sorry guys!
B000002OVJ|4.0|After the discipline and work put into 'Tommy', these guys were so well rehearsed and it shows on the greatest live recording of all time. It shows how irrelevant live albums are in the present day. The power just shines through. Have a listen to 'Sparks' at full tilt first thing in the morning and tell me if you see God!!
B00005OM4N|5.0|I mean that very positively, as I found her last two cds to be some of the most listened to in my collection.  Sure, there are flaws, the cd is too short, many of the songs are a little slow, but overall, it's a great listening experience.  Her voice is unique in a very good way, giving her songs the perfect edge.  &quot;Slave for you&quot; is not one of the best songs on the cd, but it does a lot for Britney's image, good or bad.  On the other hand, &quot;Overprotected&quot; is a perfect dance tune, starting off with the short intro, and then introducing a lot of synthesized melody along with a very good text.  I won't comment on every song, but one thing I've really come to enjoy on Britney's cds is her cover of a classic.  She chose &quot;I need rock 'n roll&quot; for this one, and once again outdid herself.  &quot;Cinderella&quot; creates that bridge between the fictional world of music and the real world where Britney has become the princess of pop and definitely stepped out of the shadow of peers such as Christina Aguilera.  A good addition to any collection, I recommend this cd.  It's funfilled and yet serious, high-speed but a lot deeper than the visible surface.<BR>Way to go Britney!
630289915X|5.0|Frank Capra's apex of his career never received the recognition it deserved until the late 1970's. Then America started to wake up and thanks to televised viewings, the movie became a hit. This is one of my favorite movies of all time. Jimmy Stewart has one of the most engaging roles of his career as George Bailey, the hometown hero who has big dreams, but gives them up for doing the right thing. Younger children may not be able to appreciate the depth of this film, but when we watched a showing of this film at a local theatre, my younger brother actually enjoyed it. A true American classic that will touch the everyman in us all. What more needs be said?
B000003RCY|5.0|For being Rammsteins first album it is their best album, it portrays the emotion of life and love throught a sick yet awsome way.  Every song is unique in its own way neither the songs sond remotely the same.  The introduction Wollt Ihr Das Bett In Flammen Sehen? is a great way to start an album, they hit you hard with the first song and don't stop.  There are many songs on the album that are remembered classics: Der Meister, Seeman, Rammstein and Asche zu Asche; these songs are the key backbone of the album opening up to the adrieniline of passionate Rammstein fans.<BR>I will break down my favorite song on the album: Weisses Fleisch.<BR>The keyboard in the beginning is trippy bringing an effect that techno brings, then going into the drums with the bass in there as well, then out of nowhere, &quot;Weisses Fleisch!&quot; It hits you like a ton of bricks. The guitar brings out the intensity in the song right after the weisses fleisch shout, and then slows down as Till(the singer) begins singing.  The chorus is outstanding, brilliant work of art, the lyrics and instruments harmonize so well that it catches your ears.  finally the end, ending with the chorus I believe was the best thing for this song, getting the point across that he is just like his father and that he is livin under his fathers image, and just the effect with &quot;erleuchtet.....Mich!&quot;  having the song end with Mich symbolizes that its about him and and well it makes the song more intense.  I believe this song is their best song and I believe the album herzeleid is their best album.
B00005R23S|4.0|Very good sound and loved the shows format, but can't understand why it was mixed as 5.1 and is light on the .1With a band of this caliber, why hold back a great drummer, and bass player???If this would have had super bass like the rest of the sound, I would have given it 5 stars..........Still a very good DVD.
B000001EC1|5.0|I completely love this CD! Some of the songs are without much beat, or they are too long, but my all time favorites are Living On A Prayer, Keep The Faith, Always, Lay Your Hands On Me, U Give Love A Bad Name, Bad Medicine, Runaway and In &amp; Out Of Love. Bon Jovi has very good lyrics and the whole album has a very good rock quality! Buy the CD, it is a must-have for any Bon Jovi fan!

B000002L82|4.0|Dude!  This is an awesome album.  Age of Consent kicks off with a rolling Joy Division styled bass/drum groove.  Bernard then adds  a sweet simple chord, a reaching majestic guitar line, and what we're listening to is Joy Division but with Ian Curtis' shocking, disturbing, painful human poetry replaced with Bernard Sumner's childlike emotion of bittersweet ecstasy and love.  And what gasses me is that it has that surf-rock dancy groove that always sounds so ill in Joy Division's music.  It sounds like a summer day spent all alone.<br />     The Village is true New Order.  Ecstatic love song.  &quot;Our love is like the flowers..., the rain, the sea and the hours&quot;<br />     Your Silent Face is another gem.  Beautiful, sad, warm, comforting childlike art.<br />     The rest of the album is filled with songs that in my opinion ape Joy Division's bleak style but not it's compelling grip.  The exception being Leave Me Alone, sounding to me like a heartfelt evocation of an Ian Curtis who is at peace.  A cryptic and emotional musical representation of a million overcast days.<br />     All in all, a fine album with a distinctive steely early-techno post-punk sound whose highpoints come when Bernard steps forward from the shadow of Joy Division to assert his own messages of love.<br />     Nice cover too...
B00005QG9J|5.0|This disc is one killer piece of plastic and foil.  It just rocks so nice.  It's got some action pact tracks, but also a few mellow chillout songs.  That's the only word you can use for the quiet songs, \\"Chillout.\\"  I had some friends over and it was like 2 a.m. and we just listened to this and it was...great.  And with Aqueous Transition at the end there, it nearly knocked me out with its super soporific qualities. (for those not in my english class, soporific means puts you to sleep).  <br />This album is very uplifting, no depressing, soulless garbage that most bands are shoving down the throats of the unwashed masses ....  <br />Oh, yeah,...Get it. right now.
B00003CXZ1|3.0|It's not a bad movie. Really it isn't. Baseketball. Now that was a bad movie. Angelina Jolie made a good Lara Croft much to my surprise. It had alot of the special effects we see in bigger movies and was pretty much well done. What it lacked though was an interesting plot. It fell back to the contrived plot of an item of power being sought after by the bad guys. What it needed though if it was already borrowing from the Indiana Jones legacy was to make the plot center over an item or history that would've been more familiar to viewers. The made up history they did just wasn't attention getting. Now, if they centered the show over perhaps Excalibur or the cross Christ was crucified on it might've made the movie more interesting.
B00003CXXS|5.0|To my surprise, this movie is much better than the first two movies in terms of story and special effects.<BR>This sequel gets right to the point and wastes no time. The story flows quickly and sustains the excitement from begining to end.<BR>The special effects are the best I have ever seen. The dinosaurs look extremely good and they move extremely smooth. The newer creatures make the special effects even sweeter.
B00005NWRS|5.0|Ryan Adams's latest CD \\"Gold\\" is finally receiving well-deserved attention, primarily due to the haunting video for \\"New York, New York\\" ...The fact that the song is actually great, is helpful too... Anyone expecting another \\"Heartbreaker\\"-type album, will be shocked at the evolution Ryan Adams has gone through in just a year. The \\"Gold\\" album I bought actually consists of 2 CDs, the \\"regular\\" album supplemented by a 20 minute-long \\"Side 4\\" CD, the prolific Adams thus giving us a total of 90 min. of music!<br />Besides the familiar New York, New York\\", the standout tracks include \\"Firecracker\\" (with Ryan belting \\"I just wanna be your firecracker/I just wanna burn up bright and hard!\\", which he very well might, looking at the energy he displays at his concerts), \\"Answering Bell\\" (think 70's Van Morrison or the Band), \\"La Cienega Just Smiled\\" (think Jackson Browne-like), the hard rocking tracks \\"Gonna Make You Love Me\\" and \\"Touch, Feel & Lose\\" (with horns!), the achingly beautiful \\"When The Stars Go Blue\\", the 8+ min. \\"Nobody Girl\\" (with a great guitar solo), and the piano-based closing track \\"Goodnight Hollywood Blvd.\\" On the \\"Side 4\\" bonus CD, \\"The Bar Is A Beautiful Place\\" stands out. One more track deserves special mention: the end-of-relationship song \\"Harder Now That It's Over\\", which musically reminds me of \\"Harvest\\"-era Neil Young; at the end of the song, Ryan keeps repeating \\"I'm sorry...I'm sorry...honey, I'm sorry\\" but in concert he turns the song completely around by mumbling at the very end \\"...but not really\\". Wow!<br />At the age of 26, Ryan Adams is just getting warmed up with the very rich \\"Gold\\" album. He supposedly has 3 new albums in the works already (which he says he may release as a single \\"best of\\" album!). I can't wait to hear more.
B00005N53P|5.0|I just bought Is This It yesterday and am absolutely obsessed with the CD.  I can't put it down.  They are a very talented group and I can't wait to hear more.  The CD is well worth it!

B00004RHZU|5.0|Pink's debut album _Can't Take Me Home_ is an incredibly honest, talent-ridden collection of beautifully produced songs from a refreshing artist.<br />Pink's most notable characteristic is her brightly-plumed hair, indicative of her fluorescent personality.  Lacking of many artists, Pink is a joy to see working; an intriguing individual with an interesting life story.  Experiences as a club dancer, skater kid, raver, lead singer of a rock band, member of a gospel choir were surely informed by the life experiences of the throw-away from a divorced home.<br />_Can't Take Me Home_ is a much more personal work than that generally found in a Pop or R&amp;B débuts.  Having co-written a little under half the works on the album, so much of the album was harvested Pink's life that one felt that they'd gotten to know her on a plane instead of by listening to her CD while on the plane.  Conversely, whenver the songs weren't of her machination, it is smartly written or produced by someone who is able to weave thier work into the mix without one noticing that there's been an alternative injection of artistry.<br />&quot;Split Personality&quot; works as a great opener by outlining each of Pink's psychoses as it segs into a disgruntled expression of frustration brought about by an ex's facility in being a good boyfriend to the next after shafting the former (Pink), in &quot;Hell Wit Ya.&quot;  Babyface's &quot;Most Girls&quot; expresses Pink's frustration with guys' thinking that she needed monetary compensation to inspire interest.  Then, Pink closes the door on an ex-boyfriend who has betrayed her and wants to return in &quot;There U Go*.&quot;  &quot;You Make Me Sick&quot; whines/emotes the sensation of reluctant desire before &quot;Let Me Let You Know&quot; conveys the end of a struggling love affair.  112-produced &quot;Love Is Such A Crazy Thing&quot; is an ode to the unfamiliarity of a love that's come to be and &quot;Private Show&quot; features Pink turning the tables ona guy who thinks that he's just using her to get his rocks off, while she's not going to give him the opportunity.  &quot;Can't Take Me Home&quot; is the tale of a relationship wherein Pink's man couldn't reconcile his desire for Pink with the perceptions of others.  &quot;Stop Falling&quot; is another expression of sexual independence as Pink tells a guy about her inability to love and her unwillingness to fall in love with him.  &quot;Do What U Do&quot; is a love of individuality followed by a comparison of the unfulfilled desire to express one's love to a bodily function in &quot;Hiccup&quot;  The set ends with &quot;Is It Love&quot; is a tale of innocence lost as described from a girl to her parents.  And she can't be taken home.<br />Pink's most audible or visual expressions are in the ways that she sings and dances.  Pink's soaring soprano is intriguing in and of itself, in large part due to the knowledge that it could use some polish.  Pink's danceability got MTV to invite her to emulate a performance from the early career of Janet Jackson, one of the most well-received dancers among recording artists.<br />Pink is a dynamo who allowed us into her life with her first album.  After listening to it, one can easily feel her friend or at least a pert of said life.  It would seem that her next contribution _Missundaztood_ will allow us even further into her life and thinking, if the song lyrics that I've read are any indication.<BR>Pink's debut album is an awesome romp through her head and talent that is not to be missed.  Purchase it.
6304493681|2.0|While this film features animation that is truly interesting to watch, it does nothing in terms of plot, characters, or even originality. Sure, you'll see very interesting weaponry and a quasi-futuristic city (the detail in the backgrounds is arguably the most enjoyable aspect of this film). But overly plagued by nudity and witless interactions of the characters, this film barely makes the cut for a rental.
B00005RIKD|5.0|iAM A LISTENER OF STINGS FROM THE POLICE UNTIL NOW AND .THIS ALBUM IS BT FAR MY FAVORITE . iT'S ALL THERE AND IT'S ALL GOOD NO GREAT. PERFECT SETTING THIS GUY IS A MASTER AT LIVE PERFORMANCE. i TAKE MY HAT OFF TO HIM THANKS FOR THE MUSIC STING. i'M OUT MARCUS
B00004Y7SF|5.0|And excellent album wich portrays Christina's most spellbinding vocal abilities in the most soulful and joyful holiday spirit. Each song has a unique tone and touch to it, making it suitable for all ages. At only 20 Christina has accomplished so much from winning a Grammy to a an MTV VMA to a Billboard Award. Grab this album to experience the exceptional vocal range this artist can present in the most joyous and holiday tradition.
B00005QZWI|5.0|hey , well Im shocked I was worried that Howard shore was not the right person , but dang its brilliant , if you are a fan of gladiator , titanic , braveheart (thesoundtracks) gooooooooo get this one!!
B0000025RI|5.0|I'll admit, this is a great album, but you're just being foolish if you sit around and say this is the greatest album of all time.  My favorite song on here is &quot;Billie Jean&quot;.  It just as cool lyrics and a really cool video(especially considering it was made in like 1983).  I like the song &quot;Beat It&quot; almost as much as &quot;Billie Jean&quot;.  I think the video for it is corny though.  &quot;The Girl is Mine&quot; feat. Paul McCartney is a cool ballad, but I've actually never seen the video for it.  I'm not a huge fan of the song &quot;Thriller&quot;, but the video is so cool that you have to like it.  &quot;Wanna Be Startin' Somethin'&quot; has cool lyrics about Michael's life.  I also like the song &quot;PYT&quot;, which has Janet singing background vocals.  My only complaint about this album is that it only has 9 songs on it.  The 9 songs are pretty much perfect though, so you have to buy this album.  I know that Michael's recently released Invincible, but I think his new music stinks, so if you want the good stuff, buy this and his other album that's almost as good, Off The Wall.
B00005J9M3|5.0|PSB had matured greatly with this album. It is one of my favorate PSB albums and has powerfull lyrics and music that really showed them at a level not seen before. I have been a fan for a long time and find this album very mature. This is not just another dance album, it has emotions running wild all through out.  There are more slow songs in this album than any other previous PSB's, yet they still make you dance.  The music and lyrics are just fantastic and will make you think about life. I consider this PSB's MASTERPIECE.
B00005LOUP|4.0|The Grinch is intended to be entertaining and not entirely thought provoking! Dr. Seuss' original it is not, but few movies ever capture the essence of the original. Enjoy the movie for its intended purpose and don't be a GRINCH.  &quot;Christmas doesn't come from a store.....Perhaps Christmas means a little bit more............&quot; Tis the season to be jolly.........Merry Christmas to all and to all a good night...
6303433766|4.0|Yes, I found this movie, slow moving. But after all, there are many movies that are slow. Two teen girls,...as they explore there world, they get caught up with each other, and because of family pressures. {their sexuality} commit the worse crime there is. <BR>This is a true story, so you have to be careful in viewing the words and contex. I will also add, that I think you may have to view this more then to once to get a true life lesson from those events.
0385505833|5.0|The prior reviewer from New York gave the author (not the book, I expect) five stars for how clever he was to exploit &quot;the irony of it all&quot;. I fully agree. We in the U.K. do not have this problem on Christmastime. So, I'm shocked at what the author says in this book. Is that how it really is in America? I don't know if I would recommend the book for its value. I would recommend that you read the fascinating review from 18 November, and then decide whether the book is worth buying just for a lesson in enterprise by the author.
B00004XQ83|5.0|I saw this movie while passing time waiting to meet someone in a mall and as soon as I got out of the movie, I went to a record store in the same mall and bought this sound-track.  I'm not a country or bluegrass fan, but this recording is so good it defies labelling.  I took it home and began to listen to it.  My 16 year old daughter and 12 year old son usually leave the room when I listen to my music, but they both stayed put.  They began questioning me regarding various subjects from the depression to Greek History.  (The movie is a re-telling of the Odyssey story of Homer)<br />The next day when I went to start the CD again, it was missing from my CD player.  My kids, whose usual musical tastes run to Smashing Pumpkins and other grunge rockers whose names I can never remember, had actually taken my CD and were listening to it.  I found out because I heard them fighting over who would get to use the CD next.<br />If you knew my kids, you would realize how entertaining this CD must be. I don't have words enough to describe how much I enjoy Man of Constant Sorrow, Down in the River to Pray, and In the Jailhouse Now, and all of the other selections.  Listen to it and you may be surprised how much you like it.
B00005QZWI|5.0|Majestic.  This score is amazing.  The album comes with different covers, I got the one with Saruman because Christopher Lee is the man.  I have the whole Star Wars trilogy soundtrack and this, I must say is sort of the opposite of Star Wars.  This stuff is grand, epic, yet doesn't constantly use charecter and place themes like Star Wars does.  It realy teers at the emotions, and is subtle, yet strong when it has to be, amazing vocal works as well, the last song features disarming vocals by Enya, I doubt anyone will want to get up right after the movie ends. Anyway quit reading this and get it!
B00005QATY|4.0|I don't know if you get as tired as I do looking for a good, intelligent movie, but I get tired of Jim Carey making strange faces and depressing losers on a crime,sex,or drug spree.  I had no idea what to expect when I saw this movie while waiting to meet someone at a mall, but I was entranced.  I found it touching, funny, and thought-provoking all at the same time.<br />The only drawback was that sometimes the dialogue was unintelligible - kind of the aural equivalent of all of those scenes where it's so dark that you can't see what is happening. Now I realize that making the movie-goer uncomfortable and sit forward in his seat may have a role in a suspense movie, but there is no role for this kind of manipulation in a movie that is supposed to be entertaining.<br />Nevertheless, I bought this movie the first day it was out - I even pre-ordered it.  I usually don't buy movies, nor do I watch them more then once.  I've enjoyed it immensely and the music is incredible.
B00005QGAZ|5.0|If you don't know by now, that Michael Joseph Jackson is the true King Of Pop, then you are just lost in the dark.  He's the man.
B000001E8P|5.0|perhaps the best way to describe pulp is this: utterly british.  &quot;different class&quot; is a concept album of sorts; many songs revolve around social class differences that abound in the UK.  nevertheless, this is an album that can be appreciated by anyone.  jarvis cocker's sarcastic lyrics and unique speech patterns are amusing enough on their own, but pulp really knows how to make a catchy tune.  this album is worth owning just because of &quot;common people&quot; and the part where jarvis whispers &quot;are you shoor?!?&quot;  of course, cocker's dirty-old-man lyrics are in full effect on tracks like &quot;pencil skirt&quot; and &quot;underwear.&quot;  best tracks are: common people, disco 2000, mis-shapes, sorted for e's and wizz.
B00005QGAX|5.0|There's nothing I can say about this album.  If you've seen all my other reviews on Michael Jackson, then you should know that I can't say enough about the King Of Pop.
B00005OM4N|5.0|I love this album, you cant possibly find a better album on this earth. Every song is so good, you cant say which is best, cause all of them is just too good. Her vocals are perfect, and the songs have everything. Just buy it, and you will hear what I mean. I can promise you 1 thing, you wont regret it!
B00004U8P9|5.0|To keep this short I just want to say that this is a great movie.For some it may not make sense,but it's their loss.The music is addictive and Tim Curry gives an exellent performance as the sweet transvestite.I recomend this cult classic because its fun and I promise you won't get tired of it so what are you waiting for?Once you you watch it  you'll want to be doing the &quot;Time Warp again!&quot;
0553577123|5.0|when my teacher first brought up this project i thought oh another (sarcastacly)book. but this girl was just like everyone else in our class and she had so much wisdom. Very far from what her wisdom should be at 14. This book made me try to be more friendly and try to understand other people's point of views.
B00003CXZ1|5.0|Why is it, that we want more from a movie than is on offer?  Come on chaps, &quot;Lara Croft - Tomb Raider&quot; isn't a film of any intellectual merit, it is merely an exciting adventure movie with a whole host of good special effects and lots of quality funny moments.  I for one really enjoyed this film, I expected nothing from it other than a series of explosions and gun battles and that is what I got and I loved every single minute of it.  The plot wasn't too complicated, with Lara piecing together a mystery about an ancient clock and two pieces of a mystical triangle that has the ability to fragment time and space and of course there are the obligatory bad guys trying to get their hands on it.  There was a fine cast of characters from Iain Glenn playing the evil Mr. Powell (the main bad guy) to Chris Barrie of Red Dwarf fame coming across with great aplomb as the overtly English Butler Hillary who tries and fails to make his young employer into a regal young lady instead of a gun-toting maniac.  One of my favorite moments is when Hillary realizes that the security in the Croft Mansion has been breeched and there is a battle going on downstairs.  He calmly gets out of bed, dons a bullet proof vest taken from his wardrobe, locks and loads a massive double barreled shot gun without blinking an eye then carefully steps into his leather slippers before stepping out to join the melee.  I cracked up laughing, it was SO funny!  Angelina Jolie is well cast as Lara Croft, and she manages a pretty good English accent too as well as doing ALL her own stunts which impressed me big time.  The special effects were superb, watch out for when a husky-dog jumps through a break in the fabric of time, it's awesome.  All in all this is fun, fun film and that is the way it should be treated.  The DVD is worth every cent and is stuffed full of extras that just add to the enjoyment of the film.  So come on chaps, give it a chance, you never know, you just might enjoy yourselves!
B000050XEI|4.0|I had heard the popular &quot;Only Time&quot; on the radio, and loved it, so I purchased this CD basically for that one song. I was pleasantly surprised there are several other beautiful songs on this CD. If you're new to Enya, this is the one to get. My only complaint is that her songs are all very similar in rhythm, tone and feel. These are also not songs that most will learn the lyrics to, but they are beautiful and relaxing. Perfect for unwinding after work with some candles and incense burning.
B00005QZWJ|5.0|A wonderful compilation of music that takes the guise of Wagner like epics, to Celtic ditties.  I have to admit I bought this album with some trepidation as I was such a fan of the music score from Ralph Bakshi's 1978 &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot;.  Who can forget the powerful music of that understated film and not shiver with delight? However I was not to be disappointed by my reluctant purchase.  Each track stands on its own merit and Enya's contributions are wonderfully old Irish, her voice mellow and deep and totally in sync with Tolkein's vision of Middle Earth.  There are harps, flutes, and violins galore, plus an array of backing vocals that reminded me of old Gregorian chants with a mystical attitude.  With 18 tracks on the CD, plus a free collector's card from the film, this is a good buy for us die-hard fans of &quot;Lord of the Rings.&quot;  If the music score is anything to go buy, then we are all in for a real visual and auditory treat when the film finally is released on December 19th 2001.
B00003CXXJ|5.0|Go buy this movie.  Trust everyone on this.  This movie is one of those instant classics that appeal to people of all ages.  For the kids you have the amazing animation and fairy tail characters.  For adults there is a wonderful story, fantastic characters, and of course those wonderful allusions (made famous in the Simpsons and Toy Story 1+2) that just go right over kids heads but will have you rolling with laughter.<br />Then animation and attention to detail in this film are nothing short of breathtaking.  There are many times you will forget you are watching a computer-animated movie.  The characters are all brilliant but the Gingerbread Man and Eddie Murphy as the talking Donkey absolutely steal every scene they are in.  If you loved the Toy Stories, or you are breathing, or you even have an ounce of a sense of humor then this movie is absolutely a must have.<br />The DVD version comes with 2 Disks.  Disk one is a Standard TV width.  Disk 2 is the real treasure for those with HDTV and surround sound system as it sports anamorphic widescreen (put your TV on full mode and if fills the entire screen without any sort of distortion) and a wonderful DTS soundtrack in addition to the Dolby 5.1.  There is also the usual assortment of DVD goodies spread over both disks.  One of the more interesting goodies is a Magic Mirror version of The Magic 8 ball.  Should you buy this DVD?  It is decidedly so.<br />Why are you still reading this?  Click the button to buy this movie.
B00005B4GU|5.0|A lot less gloomy than Kid A, Amnesiac still provides just as much innovation and variety as its brilliant twin album.  Everything here is predictably gold for any fan of the \\"new\\" Radiohead, and once again, the power behind every song takes time to emerge - which I think gives it a very personal and ultimately satisfying edge.
B00005LOUQ|3.0|I saw the Grinch yesterday and was expecting it to be terrible but it's actually not bad at all. I love the look of it and Jim Carrey is fantastic as is the make-up. Jim is so good that he even has great chemestry with the .....dog. I loved their scenes together, they're both funny and heart-warming. Ron Howard had a lot of guts making this film and deserves a lot more credit than he got. This is a very different film to say the least and both critics and moviegoers frankly just don't know what to think of films like this. If it was better I'd compare it to the Wizard of Oz but it's hardly that good at all. The bad is that the Whos are a bunch of jerks, it's no wonder that the Grinch hates them. Plus the film runs off course a lot, it takes too long for the Grinch to actually go out and try to ruin Christmas. The Grinch is no great movie but it is a lot more entaining and fun than it got credit for.  Take a chance and watch it, you might just like it. Advice: Don't expect the cartoon special you loved as a kid and chance has it you might enjoy it more.
B00005RFQ5|5.0|Folks have jumped the gun with regard to heralding Prince's return to making great music when talking most of his work from 1991-2000, but this new collection rivals 1991 and Purple Rain (in my book). He pulls no punches. And it's not just about the sacred and profane. His other favorite topics, race, individualism, the politics of questioning the powers that be and just finding ways to be happy are all covered. And the musicianship is definitely tight -- hornz, synths, guitar, and some real &quot;sangin'&quot; for a change. Enjoy!
B000059PQ5|1.0|I head a lot of good things about this -- comparisons to Leone's films and that it was so popular it spawned a horde of sequals. I had contemplated buying the Anchor Bay DVD, and upon viewing, I'm so glad I didn't. Franco Nero is absolutely dreadful -- i'm not sure if he or the dubbing is to blame but the delivery and dialogue are some of the worst I've ever witnessed. The character is such a goody goody with lines like, &quot;You shouldn't treat women like that&quot; and &quot;That's not right.&quot; To compare this to Leone is to reduce Leone's interesting characters and cinematography into cardboard gunfights. I didn't even finish the film.
B000058T5E|5.0|Jeff Beck's You Had it Coming really kicks. This album proves that Jeff is indeed the greatest guitarist ever. Nadia is perhaps the best song on the album, and is one of Jeff's greatest. Suspension is mysterious and soulfull, a great listen. Dirty Mind is funky and shows Jeff's playing and control quite well. Loose Cannon is utterly awesome, as well as Left Hook. Listen to the fade out on Left Hook, it'll leave you sweating.<br />Jeff's soloing is totally AWESOME on this album. Earthquake, Roy's Toy, Dirty Mind, Loose Cannon, Left Hook...they all have awesome solos and portay Jeff's one of a kind phrasing. Nadia is practically a solo in itself! Jeff's tone is massive and soulfull, YHIC is not to be missed.<br />This album really rocks. It's a great companion to Blow by Blow, Wired, and Guitar Shop.
B00005QZWI|4.0|Please don't mess it up!  Please don't mess it up!<br />Let's face it: for many of us avid fans of 'Lord of the Rings', the new movie adaptation is likely to be the last in our lifetime.  It is tremendously important that director Peter Jackson and colleagues don't make a mess of it.  Everything I have read and heard so far about this film trilogy indicates that Peter wants to create a cinematic experience that won't disappoint the faithful.  It looks like that if ever in doubt about a particular aspect, he tends toward the cautious and the accurate rather than the experimental.<br />Thus on the soundtrack, for instance, we have no rap music, thank goodness.  There is also no thrash metal, thank goodness, although some directors may have felt the Orcs deserved it.  Instead, we have a mixture of the orchestral and the New Age -- a potent combination of Wagner, Bruckner, Orff and Enya unleashed on one of the best stories written in the 20th century.  This is music that should not date terribly within say, the next fifty years.  It is music for the imagination -- highly visual stuff, released one month before the movie hits the cinemas, to encourage us to listen in a darkened room and conjure up our own dramatic scenes.<br />Like the BBC adaptation, it looks like the movie adaptation of the Fellowship of the Ring has been forced to excise some major characters.  Will it include Tom Bombadil?  I suspect not.  The principal disappointment could arise from Gollum apparently  not making an appearance until the second film.<br />There seem to be at least five or six different versions of this soundtrack album, each with a different 'collectors card' on the front cover of the CD.  Hopefully the rest of the packaging and the CD itself are identical across all versions. ...<br />It's a pretty site, though I'm not sure I have fully explored it.<br />In summary, so far the omens look very, very good that Peter Jackson in his choice of Howard Shore and Enya as soundtrack composers has not messed it up.s has not messed it up.
B00003CXCQ|5.0|This is a very happy movie maybe just a little too happy for teens. This is a family movie but teens find it childish. Great for kids 10 and under. OK for adults. <BR>I rate 11 out of 10 for kids 9 out of 10 for teens and 10 out of 10 for adults.
B00005RFQ5|5.0|i'll start this review off with a disclaimer.  if you are a prince fan who only owns \\"the hits\\" and/or \\"purple rain\\", you probably won't like this cd.  if you have weathered the prince journey through his entire catalog, then enter the next phase in the purple one's illustrious, if not controversial, career.  i work at a music store, and we did not receive an advance copy of this cd.  so [in] the morning..., i hurriedly popped open a copy of \\"the rainbow children\\" to listen to before the store opened.  i was taken aback.  this is the album i was expecting after \\"come\\".  it is a free-flowing jazzy trip meant (i believe) to be listened to in its entirety.  prince is no longer a pop songwriter....he is more a sonic craftsman who seems to be searching for the perfect jam. and, yes, prince's newfound religious beliefs (namely jehovah's witness) do figure into the mix quite heavily.  so basically, if you didn't give up on prince in the 90's when he took musical chances with every release, you'll dig this!!

B000007T2Z|4.0|I picked up f#a#infinity on the faith of hearing part of an mp3 of the Dead Flag Blues and haven't regretted it at all.  It was my first introduction to whatever genre of music this is -- &quot;sonic landscape&quot; or whatnot.<BR>Describing GYBE has been attempted by many other reviewers and I'm not sure it's an easy task.  Appropriate adjectives include haunting, warm, menacing, dissonant and melodic and patternless at first.<BR>It is a record that gets rewarding after a few listens, and it works best late at night as ambient music.  Then it shines.  The subtleties show through and you wonder whattheheck they did to that guitar (or was it a cello?) to make such a noise.  It's gorgeous for those with a taste for the thoughtfully surreal.<BR>Four stars is to show my great respect, but also the fact that it has limited appeal depending on one's mood &amp; the time.
B00003CXXJ|4.0|While the movie is as good as it's gonna get and the quality of the audio and video on the DVD are excellent, it's fair to say that the extras are not worth it.<br />As for the film, Shrek is a funny, smart and wicked look at fairy tales, with the ocassional pun on Disney. The quality of the CGI is extraordinary, showing great detail and improved character movement -- check out the grass, the trees, the pouring of milk, the beer mud and the hair on the donkey, all truly amazing.<br />The voice talent is also quite good, with an outstanding performance by Eddie Murphy.<br />The extras on this DVD are what are a real disappointment (at least for me). Differently from other studios, Dreamworks decided to include both the full-screen and the widescreen versions (one on each disc), instead of releasing two different versions - this takes up a lot of memory so two discs are needed. Then, the technical goofs are not entertaining, or informative, or even amusing (except maybe for the 'chia donkey' thingee), the character interviews are boring, the international dubbing feature is a waste of time, the Xbox playing hints are of no use as is the storyboard pitch of deleted scenes.<br />Not all extras are bad, mind you, as there's a lot of stuff in there for the kiddies, and Shrek's re-voice studio is fun (but you have to have DVD-ROM, though). Also, Shrek's music hall is amusing, but wears off pretty quick. Finally, the documentary 'The tech of Shrek' is probably the best extra for the grownups or for people interested in the process of making such a film (check out the screen they had made up as a forest hut, with trees, rocks and whatnot, cool!).<br />All in all, Shrek is a very entertaining, technically amazing, funny movie, but just a good DVD -- buy it for the film!
B00004SCX6|2.0|Britneys Opps I Did it Again is a major OPPS. It is a waste of your money!! Do not buy it!!! You will be so sorry. She can not sing!!!
B00005QIPH|5.0|...it's clear that while the Strokes may not be the best band of our lifetime (though, considering the pretty poor state of music in the two-plus decades since my birth in 1977, there aren't many contenders), the Strokes are easily the best band of the moment.  <br />The critics will tell you that the band's influences include the Velvet Underground (primarily because Casablancas sounds a bit like Lou Reed on one song, the Modern Age), Television, the Stooges, Wire, etc., etc.  Do they?  Maybe, maybe not.  Critics are basically paid to compare current groups to the groups they loved when they were teenagers.  Is this useful?  Yeah, if your target audience are thirtysomethings and fortysomethings who grew up on punk and new wave.  But these comparisons are not useful to fans who don't have more than a passing acquaintance with musical history before Nevermind.  The chief question should always be:  does this band do it for you?  And the answer this time is yeah.<br />This isn't Be Here Now or one of the later, incredibly bloated Pumpkins' albums.  This album is 36 minutes long.  The production is cardboard thin.  Casablancas basically spends the whole album singing about walking out of one or another relationship (he literally uses the word \\"leave\\" and every variation thereof at least three times on seemingly every song).  But god does the album sound fantastic.  As I said above, I first heard the Strokes via the Hard to Explain/New York City Cops single.  I thought at the time that the single was as good as it got.  But the songs on Is This It that aren't on either Hard to Explain or the Modern Age are just as great.  I don't like song 10 (I can't even recall the title of the song).  But that's it.  <br />I don't know if the Strokes are going to be the biggest band in the world (and who cares when the title currently resides with U2, a band whose best album was at least four albums ago?).  I do know that there is no better live proposition around right now...And I do know that there is no better album to listen to in these sad times.  Somehow, even though all the songs are about failed relationships, this album sounds like the most optimistic and exciting thing in the world.

B00005JKHP|5.0|I wouldn't consider myself a &quot;Trekkie&quot; but I do enjoy a good sci-fi film.  I actually prefer &quot;Star Wars&quot; to &quot;Star Trek&quot;.  I was a loyal fan to the &quot;Trek&quot; films and enjoyed the first 3 or 4.  I remember seeing &quot;Star Trek - The Motion Picture&quot; on New Years Day 1980. It was a thoroughly enjoyable holiday picture.<br />My next memory of &quot;ST-TMP&quot; was when laser disks first came out (mid-80's?).  I stood in a department store and forwarded through the scene where Spock hovers outside V'Ger.  Laser disks amazed me - what an incredible invention for movie buffs!<br />I like &quot;ST-TMP&quot; for three reasons:  the story, the scope, and the effects.  I prefer the Trek stories that comment on our humanity - that's what Gene Roddenberry did best with the series.  &quot;ST-TMP&quot; definitely makes a wonderful comment on the human condition.  The scope of the film is epic. It is definitely an &quot;event&quot; film and probably had the highest budget of them all. Robert Wise's direction is strong and steadfast.  The characters (and starship) are given cinematic weight.  Finally, the effects, now 22 years old, look wonderful.  The Enterprise model is gorgeous.  And the V'Ger trip has some beautiful scenery.<br />This new DVD is done very well.  There are two disks and lots of bonus stuff.  Most interesting is the documentary &quot;Phase II: The Lost Enterprise&quot; which describes a second Trek series that was abandoned and eventually became &quot;ST-TMP&quot;.  Included are some screen tests for the series - real rare stuff!  The main disk contains some neat text commentary (which appears at the bottom of the screen) by Michael Okuda.<br />As for the &quot;Director's Edition&quot; version of the film: I like it.  Robert Wise's tinkering has actually made the film's storyline easier to follow.  He has clarified what V'Ger (the entity) really is.  Before, V'Ger appeared to be a big cloud.  We actually see V'Ger as aship now.  The script (and actors) referenced V'Ger as a &quot;ship&quot; or &quot;vessel&quot; - we never got to see it before.  Also, Spock's character arc is more clear.<br />&quot;ST-TMP&quot; is a grand film, highly entertaining and thought-provoking.  &quot;The Director's Edition&quot; supplements this already wonderful film.
B00003CXAA|5.0|Simply amazing. <br />What I love about the series is its completeness, the richness in portrayal by each of the actors, even if they had small parts. Above all everything in \\"one-box\\" of 4 DVDs.<br />A must buy. The specials DVD is the clincher with unbelievable revelations, material that you never imagined about this epic series - imagine someone telling you that Martin Sheen and James Caan auditioned to play Michael. This is educational.
B000000OPW|5.0|This was not the album that brought me to Siouxsie and the Banshees, but it has ended up being my favorite. Some would criticize \\"Tinderbox\\" for being more \\"pop\\" and less \\"gothic\\" than the Banshees' previous releases. It's perhaps true that the music is less adventurous, and the style is different than their previous releases; but it's more accessable and easily the most consistent album they produced. But don't think that the album is less dark and brooding as a result - it isn't. \\"Tinderbox\\" is a very somber, moody and atmospheric set of songs. Siouxsie Sioux's vocals are at their best, and the rest of the band does excellent work (John Valentine Carruthers' ethereal guitar work is sadly underrated). The album is solid from start to finish (including \\"Cities in Dust,\\" which should not be dismissed for being radio-friendly). \\"Party's Fall\\" is probably my favorite, but all the tracks are winners. Gloomy and exhilarating, I give \\"Tinderbox\\" my strongest recommendation.
0385505833|3.0|Frankly, I was disappointed, and many times thought of not finishing the book.  But ... it was so small, I stuck it out.  The ending was good, but getting there was a chore.  Mr. Grisham should stick to what he knows.
B00005RIKD|4.0|Recorded on September 11,2001,this is a fine effort by Sting. &quot;All This Time&quot; offers a different spin on some very familiar music. A kind of lounge version of Sting standards,this is a worthwhile disc to spend some time with.
B00005RHGK|1.0|I have to admit, I loved the first 15-20 minutes. It really seemed promising but COME ON. The ending is absolutely terrible, and the demon? Whoever made this movie needs to go back to film school. I am angered because movies like these make up to 40 million, and movies that are actually ORIGINAL, such as fight club do about 30 or less.<br />I honestly despise the critics who gave this movie anything over 1 star.<br />...<br />Rent, Mangler, IT, Session 9 or something along those movies, skip this one, you will be dissapointed.
B00005QDW5|5.0|We all know that it is nearly impossible to compile Pink Floyd's work into any sort of &quot;greatest hits&quot; collection. This is because of the conceptual leanings of their lyrics, the long and meandering tracks, and their method of creating full and integrated albums, instead of just individual songs. Of course you should buy the original albums (especially *Meddle* through *The Wall*) to truly explore the intricacies and strengths of Floyd's work. With these challenges in mind however, *Echoes* is actually a pretty enjoyable and believable compilation. This is because of the very creative ways in which the collection was put together. Since songs usually blended into each other on the original albums, they do the same here, leading to unknown connections between seemingly unrelated songs that may just boggle your mind. First, the band was not afraid to cut some time off of &quot;Echoes&quot; (chopping off seven minutes), or &quot;Shine on You Crazy Diamond&quot; (only including seven of the nine parts). True fans will return to the originals for the full story, but they'll also see that these edits strengthen this compilation. And then there's the unusual segues between tracks. A good example is the post-Waters &quot;Learning to Fly&quot; (1987) blending into the pre-Gilmour &quot;Arnold Layne&quot; (1967). You'd be surprised by the connections between these songs that seem to have absolutely nothing in common. Having songs from all different periods of the band's history sitting next to each other in strange ways really brings their history together, revealing common threads that you wouldn't notice by listen to the original albums one at a time.<br />And finally, at least 75% of the reviewers here on Amazon are whining about the song selection in one way or another. Well get over it. I have some minor disputes with the selections myself, but what can you do about it? You can't please all the people all the time. Instead, enjoy this collection as a career-spanning retrospective, and a collection of great Floyd songs.anning retrospective, and a collection of great Floyd songs.
0783235666|3.0|This Hitchcock movie may be scary and action-packed as well as suspenseful, but personally there are better ones.  However, I liked this movie when there were some funny parts.  One weird thing about this movie is the time it ends.  It just isn't the right time to end the movie.  So this movie may be written average, but still don't miss it.
B00005NWM3|5.0|Nickelback...WoW, I first hear them with there song &quot;Leader of Men&quot; from their first album &quot;The State&quot;. But this was the first one I had purchased and they rock!Almost every song is catchy and has great music and lyrics.Some songs talk about the lead singers haunting childhood and about all sorts of other topics worth listening too.Nickelback knows what they're doing just listen.
B00004Z459|5.0|Linkin Park are by far the best new group of 2000-2001.  All of there songs have this deep senseable meaning in their songs.  They are all REAL.  They express really issues and ways of dealing with them.  They don't go out like some of these groups and talk about having sex with girls, doing drugs, and killing people.  They remind me alot of the group, Staind.   These guys have a great start ahead of them for the future and you will find me right along with them as they go.
B00005QIPH|5.0|&quot;Blah blah blah, I'm too indie for you, this album sucks, it's too hyped, it's been done, etc.&quot; Sound like anything you've read recently? <br />The funny thing about hype--I think--is that it works both ways. People complain that an album sucks because it's &quot;too hyped&quot;, but, aren't they really just buying into the hype? I had never even heard of The Strokes until I downloaded some of their stuff off of epitonic.com. I was totally blown away. I am a die-hard fan of vintage rock and roll, and rarely listen to anything made past the 1980's, and I love this album. Yes, they have influences--every band does--but they have added something to the old &quot;insert 1 part angst, two parts catchy guitar riffs, 1 part good hair&quot; formula that people have been copying for years. One thing is apparent about this album that I value: The Strokes aren't trying to hard to be obscure and different--they're just playing good old rock and roll for music's sake, and what, may I ask, is wrong with that? <br />But, whatever, I'm not going to lend a hand to you clueless fools who choose to buy into the pretentious anti-hype. You can listen to the indie-posers and I will keep The Strokes all to myself. Thank you!

B00005QZWI|5.0|Ever since the film adaption of LOTR was announced, fans have wondered what sort of music would accompany the movie. Fans should not be dissapointed as Howard Shore has composed a great soundtrack that incoporates wonderful orchestration with incredible vocals.  &quot;I thought of it as Act One of an opera&quot; The vocals are the most prominent feature of this score, they include all male choirs representing the Dwarves, female soloists singing in Elven tounges, and Enya. It is important to note that the tracks containing Enya have been orchestrated by Shore so that a sense of continuity with the rest of the score is achieved.  <br />Favourite tracks include, 2. Concerning Hobbits - a light hearted theme that does well in capturing the feeling of the shire and its hobbit inhabitants, a pleasing element of this track including the stocatto violin, is the background string instrument that carries the basic theme throughout the track. <BR>&quot;you hear a more developed version of the theme - it's growing&quot;<BR>4. The Treason of Isengrad - beautiful vocals and the use of a solo french horn carrying the main theme, a very pure sound.<BR>17. The Breaking of the Fellowship - this is the best track on the score as it incorporates many wondeful elements of the score including the lovely flute solos, it also introduces a wonderful solo performance by a young boy that is the final touch to the great main theme.<br />The standard edition of this score comes with a glamorous booklet that has the picture of the 4 hobbits on the front. There are some very nice pictures in the booklet but the most important thing is that the lyrics, in their original printing and in English translation, are included for the listener to read along with. The standard edition also comes with 6 different insert sleeves that are placed on top of the jacket. They include, Bilbo, Frodo, Arwen, Aragorn, Gandalf, and Saruman (my choice). The cd contains a web link that allows the user access to an exclusive site containing some excellent material, albeit, mostly focusing on Enya.<br />Howard Shore states that there is over 3 hours of music composed for this single film in the trilogy. While the cd does provide a great overview of the important themes, one is left wanting to hear what else there is. Perhaps a double set cd will be released in the future or the future DVD will allow users to listen to the score in its entirety. Nonetheless, the material on the cd is quite excellent, Howard Shore, somewhat of an obscure name in score composing, has done an excellent job that will please almost all fans. But the score still has to pass the ultimate test, will it work with the sounds and visuals of the film? We'll find out on Dec 19, 2001!
B00005OM4N|5.0|Britney has got what it takes.  This album is off the hook.  She has definately proven herself as the pop princess.  This is by far her best album yet.  I hope that she releases at least 8 of the tracks. This album was definately put together.  Britney needs to stay with the same writers on this album. If the next album is like this I will totally be a slave to buying her albums.<br />Keep up the good work Britney and I hope to see your movie in February (the best month in the year).
B00005RFAI|5.0|I've always liked Pink and the way she's been different from regular pop divas. Of course, I think she's beautiful and talented, but this album lets me know that she's a real person too. It's an entire album that lets you get along with life, just like her first ever, &quot;Cant Take Me Home.&quot;<BR>This album is Funky and Fresh and I reccomend it for anyone that likes Rock bands and Pop Divas just the same. Because Pink has been across that line and back.
B0000062FJ|5.0|This seminal album by the band fronted by Carlos Santana, at the time, represented the unheard of fusion of rock and latin music.  The driving beats and excellent percussion made for an appealing sound that was unique in the late 60's and early seventies.  The first song Waiting, a foot stomping extravaganza, sets the tone for what will follow.  The group shows versatility with the next song Evil Ways, which is a more laid back number which features the voice of Greg Rollie.  The pre-Woodstock crowd of rock aficionados already knew of the prowess of the Santana band.  The latin percussion headed by Jose Chepito Areas is absolutely mind blowing.
B00005RFQ5|3.0|I've grown up listening to this guy's music. i knew from the get-go that religion played a very central part in his lyrical schemes. however, nothing really prepared me for this. here, it seems to be different in that the lyrics come first, reflecting his fascination with egyptology and his conversion to Jehovah's witness. I keep up with his career, going on his website and reading fan mags, so it didn't surprise me what he was going to talk about and reading a review of this album. but when you come across some of the lyrics, it makes you think about what's going on in his world. <BR>     some of the interludes are delivered in that 'bob george' slowed down style, delivering his philosophies. but i don't know what copy people got; my copy seems to be a normal 18-song cd, rather than 1 long cut. his beliefs have become so hardcore that i actually pressed the fast-forward on the cd to go further in the song or to the next one. i can only paraphrase what he is saying plus from my interpretation, but right off he talks about how there should be a pecking order in families-&quot;she surrendered her discerning of (the true meaning of God)...4 she trusted he would lead her in the right way...she in subjection 2 the wise one...&quot; which is a puzzling lyrical sentiment considering that lately he seems to hold women in a higher light-it sounds like she should surrender to one which is wiser. second, he makes reference to something called the new translation, from which i understand means a new reading of the bible and the new testament(?). third point is a reference to race baiting that I have never heard him use before, and considering that he has sang about how we should all get along, how we should all love each other, and how his bands from the past have been multiracial, it saddens me to hear him sing lines like &quot;holocaust aside, many lived and died; but when all truth is told, would u rather be dead or be sold? sold 2 the one who can now mate the displaced bloodline with the white jailbait&quot; then in the very next line, &quot;thinkin like the keys on prince's piano will be just fine&quot; What????? why is he disrespecting the victims and families of the victims of the holocaust and then in the next line saying that one love is best? i don't understand and I hope I'm not interpreting it wrong. a criticism of NATO is also in line w/some of his newfound beliefs (making a reference that NATO backwards is OTAN, which to him sounds like satan. hey, whatever).<BR>     musically, i don't remember any of these songs once it finished, the exception being &quot;everywhere&quot; which starts off as a beautiful ballad, midsong into a gospel song, then back into a ballad. there's no question he is a talent beyond talent. there's also no question that he has had some adversity recently in his life-the death of his child, the divorce, label difficulties, masters, etc.-but whoa he seems to have found salvation in separation. the album seems to be him saying &quot;what I know is better than you. if you don't believe it or question it then you are evil&quot;. <BR>     I speak of the lyrics primarily because that is the focus here. it's cool that he is using the touring band, from Najee on horns, etc. to that master of percussion John Blackwell (anyone who saw him drum in concert knows what a mindblowing percussionist he is). but he sounds bored with the music; maybe the music is languid soul/jazz on purpose.<BR>     he is becoming a very difficult listen to this longtime fan. this is not music to win over any new fans, and I don't think he cares-which is a new arrogance of his. it's hard to tell your favorite artist to do &quot;purple rain v2.0&quot; or sign o' the times again, but what to do? <BR>     hey, it's all just my opinion. I wouldn't have given one if I didn't care.
B00005OM4K|4.0|Hey, there's a reason, you know, why every wedding band in the world performs Proud Mary.<br />Few, if any American groups have had as short a history as CCR, yet so deep a legacy.<br />This is a band that was in the spotlight for what? Four years - tops. (1968-1971) Yet, from those few years have emerged dozens and dozens of classic tracks.<br />Like the Beatles, CCR music is so omnipresent that distinctions can no longer be made by the casual listener as to what were hit singles, and what are album tracks that have entered the collective conscience. Just as Beatles songs like Michelle, Lucy In the Sky, and A Day in the Life were never singles, neither were Creedence classics like I Heard It Thru the Grapevine, Lodi, or Ooby Dooby.<br />Now at long last a box set has arrived. I'd have preferred a little trimming, though. This box set contains more material than the complete original catalogue.<br />...and I'm stripping a star, cause I'm ticked that John Fogarty gets nothing in royalties for his magnificant contributions to  pop music of the 20th century
B00005JKHP|4.0|Well, it took them long enough to release this on DVD. I like what they did with the &quot;touch ups&quot;. They enhanced the film without going over the top with CGI and sound FX. The sidle changes are noticeable, but do not de-tract from its original content, and the text commentary was a nice surprise. The result is a fine finished product any Star trek fan will appreciate. The second disc is full of extras, deleted scenes, storyboards, etc...<br />Buy it, watch it, live long, remember and rejoice.<br />PS: I hope they do as good a job on the rest of them.
B000003CM9|5.0|This album was great the first time I heard it and has easily withstood the test of time some 30 years later.  The CD aptly starts of with Revival which will absolutely get you on your feet.  In Memory of Elizabeth Reed immediately became a concert staple of the band and a chance for Dickey Betts to show off his musical talent.  Greg Allman's singing exhibits an earthy southern soulfulness that would eventually dissipate after years of drugs and boozing.  Duane Allman's superb slide guitar dominates throughout.  Midnight Rider became another band signature song.  One of the best concert bands of all time.
B00003CXXJ|5.0|I just thought the movie was great.  Perfect funny love story line with mike myers and eddie murphy, great graphics, Just overall great movie.
0375703764|5.0|I have never read a piece of work, that was actually haunting before.  We've read ghost stories that raise goose bumps or makes you think of that thing you can't see when the lights go out, but The House of Leaves, is more than that.  The book becomes the house in your hands.  It's twists and turns leaves the reader, really twisting and turning.  Reading this book is a commitment of forever, that few, if any stories ever acheive.
B000007T1M|5.0|I was first introduced to SOAD when all sorts of web sites suggested it to me because I liked Tool. I listened to a few song samples and thought \\"hee hee, that guy sounds funny,\\" but never really took it seriously.<BR>A while later, after Toxicity was released, I heard Chop Suey on the radio and bought Toxicity the next day. I was disappointed at first, but once I really got in to it, I loved it.<BR>After I heard this one, Chop Suey sounded pretty mainstream. Songs like Sugar, Know, Spiders, Ddevil, and Peephole, that they never play on the radio, eventually made System Of A Down my second favorite band (after Tool)
0688135455|5.0|This 1902 fantasy, a gift from my parents when I was in fourth or fifth grade, features an irritable Psammead whom Cyril, Anthea, Robert, Jane, and their baby brother dig up in a sand pit. Then the magic begins. The sand-fairy does not like granting wishes, and his misshapen body with bat's ears and snail's eyes bloats when he does. The wishes, lasting only until sunset, all take unexpected, funny turns.<br />The sand-fairy and other personalities and Victorian details render the magic entirely real-world, believable. This was my favorite children's book and I relived the delight when I found a copy to share with my own children. That this volume is illustrated by one of my favorite people from one of my favorite families triples the delight.<br />The book is too challenging for independent reading for children under 10, but it's a great read-aloud for small children, as are the classics of Frank Baum, E.B. White and C.S. Lewis.<br />Edith Nesbit was like J. K. Rowling a single mother in need of a means to support her children. Her books in their era were as popular as Harry Potter in this one. Some of her observations are surprisingly humane. Nesbit's treatment of a clan of Gypsies, for example, transcends the deep prejudice of her time. Not to worry, the book is not preachy or teachy. It's just grand, eloquent fun. Alyssa A. Lappen
630575067X|1.0|Right after when I saw this movie I wish it would never been made. This is the worst Star Wars film I've ever seen. It seemed more like a kids movie to me. The other Star Wars trilogy is much more better than this and I wish that Episode IV would be Episode I, Episode V would be Episode II, and Episode VI would be Episode III (the last episode). What's the point of starting it as Star Wars - Episode IV that is ridiculous. I didn't really like the way that they did that and I hope when I see Episode II next year it would be a lot more better than Phantom Menace. If not I would really be disappointed at George Lucas. Anyways if you hadn't seen The Phantom Menace don't you will not like it stick with the original trilogy.
B00003CXE7|4.0|Gladiator was one great epic, but I didnt think it deserved the Oscar. Why you ask? Because I thought Traffic was a much more important and much more interesting. I'm not into the movies set back in midevil times, so the appeal was little if any, until I saw it. The film really takes you by suprise, especialy the Oscar calibar performance of Russell Crowe. (Which still didnt measure up to Don Cheadle's or Michael Douglas' performances in Traffic).<br />The film tells the story of how a King, (or was suppose to be a King), went from being a King to being a Slave, and then turning into a Gladiator!<br />The story really strikes a cord as the special effects are really some of the best of recent memories. But it did last a little too long. Quite a few scenes were un-neccesary, and totaly uncalled for. But that aside the film really did good in the box-office.<BR>The DVD has tons of special features, and the 2 disc set makes a great addition to a DVD Collection.<br />If you're really into the knights and kings and things of that nature, you're in for a treat.

0385505833|4.0|No, this is not a typical John Grisham novel.  Don't buy it thinking it is the typical lawyer yarn.  It's not.  It is enjoyable, though.  I laughed hard at several of the scenes at the end.  I recommend it.
B00004Z4WR|5.0|I really cant say enough about this movie. It is totally awsome, and few people agree. Many people trash talked this film, critics and audiences alike. And I think that it deserves more recognition. The film doesnt have the best acting, but the acting dont have to be Academy Award calibar. I mean its all about the action, the cars, and dont forget ... Angelina Jolie!<br />The film is about once legend car thief Randal \\"Memphis\\" Reins (Nicholas Cage), who, after going straight, must go back into the game in order to save his young brother \\"Kip\\" Reins (Giovanni Ribisi, Saving Private Ryan), one last time. He must steal 50 cars in 24 hours! With his old crew, Sway (Angelina Jolie, Girl Interrupted), (Robert Duvall, The Godfather I & II) and Hatley (Will Patton, Armageddon). Along with his new crew including his kid brother Kip (Giovanni Ribisi) and Tumbler (Scott Caan), along with many other stars.<br />This film is action from start to finish, and has a lot of real classic cars. Like the 69 Bearacuda and the 67 Shelby GT 500, this movie is destined to be a classic. And nothing outbeats hearing this on your DVD surround sound kit!

B000002H6C|5.0|Screw the production quality, this is metal the way it should be played. I bought this cd having heard that the sound quality sucked. After the first listen I was hooked, so screw all those ratings saying that the production is crappy. This is damn good metal album, and definetley one of their best!!  The best songs(in my opinion)are &quot;blackened&quot;,&quot;one&quot;,&quot;harvester of sorrow&quot;, and &quot;dyers eve&quot;. If you you've heard puppets and love that, I think this will do.
630542828X|2.0|This film was really too over-rated. They said it was the best political thriller of all time? No way! Its too drawn out, the acting is ok, but that was thanks to John Travolta (who wasnt all that good himself), and well William H Macy isnt any good. James Gandolfini is ok, but hes only in 15 minutes, (and thats pushing it).<br />The film is about this law firm, who is headed by John Travolta (Pulp Fiction, Grease). His firm is rich, and only worry about themselves, until he finds this woman who is needing help. Supposedly her son, along with seven other children have died from leukemia. They suspect its the drinking water. As John Travolta struggles to find out what happened, even if it means he will loose his reputation, career, and his home.<br />This film has a really good cast with John Travolta, Robert Duvall (The Godfather, The Godfather Part II), William H Macy (Magnolia, Air Force One), and James Gandolfini (The Sopranos, Get Shorty). But that dont always make for a good movie. This film is just not my cup of tea. If you want to see something of this nature check out The Insider (Russell Crowe, Al Pacino) or Erin Brokovich (Julia Roberts).<br />* Region 1 encoding (US and Canada only)<BR>* Color, Closed-captioned, Widescreen<BR>* Theatrical trailer(s)<BR>* Production featurette<BR>* Widescreen (2:35:1)
B00003CXXJ|5.0|This has to be the best animated flick I've seen since Princess Mononoke (not to parents PM is PG-13). It cleverly satirizes the many annoying things about Disney. It is good to see an animated film succeed that isn't made by the Mouse. Disney has made a lot of infantile movies and almost destroyed animation as a creative artform. With Shrek there might be hope for the medium of animation inside of America after all.
B00003CXXS|4.0|Jurassic Park III really did a number on the summer box office. It grossed $100,485,000 in the box office. I think that people expected too much drama in this film, but it was ALL action. They have had been too much talk about the film lacking a storyline! WHAT?!? If you're too dumb too see the storyline then you dont know too much.<br />The film is about a supposedly rich couple (William H Macy and Téa Leoni), whose son gets lost in the Jurassic Park. Now they must retrieve him by taking dinosaur expert Dr. Alan Grant (Sam Neil) and his protégé (Allesandro Nivola), to take them on a tour of the park. Little does the Doctor know that their planning on landing in Jurassic Park! From then on all new dinosaurs appear, and the chaos begins.<br />This film was far-too short, but it is a great movie. (The movie only lasted 1 Hour: 23 Minutes). But it has superb acting, and great script, not to mention a ton of action. If there's one action DVD you can't resist, its this!<br />Special Features include:<br />* Region 1 encoding (US and Canada only)<BR>* Color, Closed-captioned, DTS Surround Sound<BR>* Theatrical trailer(s)<BR>* Making of JPIII<BR>* Feature Commentary<BR>* New dinosaurs of JPIII <BR>* Tour of Stan Winston Studio<BR>* Visit to ILM<BR>* Dinosaur turntables<BR>* Behind-the-Scenes Montage<BR>* Storyboard Sequences<BR>* JPIII Archives<BR>* Finding New Dinosaurs<BR>* Widescreen anamorphic format (2:35:1)<br />** THIS DVD WILL BE RELEASED DECEMBER 11TH, 2001 **
B00000K19E|4.0|The one problem I have with this film is that the main idea that humans would be used as batteries seems far-fetch. I don't mind far out speculation if it is made plausible, which there is no attempt to. Surprisingly this flaw is not critical, and the is very good desptie of it. Anyone used to mindless FX movie probably won't care. I really didn't either. There are plenty of cool things in this movie: gunfights, explosions, and kung fu. The story actually has more than one layer (most movies rarely have half a layer) to it. References to the Bible, Taoism, greek mythology, the cyberpunk writers of the '80s (those really cool glasses that Morpheus and Neo where where a trademark of such writers as Bruce Sterling and William Gibson), _Alice in Wonderland_, and Neil Gaiman's Sandman comic books.
B00003CXFG|3.0|Pitch Black is a really good Sci-Fi/Horror movie. The cast is ok, but Vin Diesel is the best actor in this movie. But the scting doesnt matter when you have a good script. The reason I only gave<BR>it three stars is because of the impact.<br />The film is setup perfectly for a sure classic, but when the main storyline comes into focus, the scares arent really scares, and that changes the impact of the movie because of it. The film does get boring, and you do wish for the ending to come, because of the lack of substance. Another thing that drops my rating is the fact that the police officer and the girl die. They set it up for a great flick if they didnt kill out the two characters who add \\"substance\\" to the script. And really the main conflict. But they ...that up as well<br />The movie is about a group of people who land on an unknown planet. But after a while, the sun goes out, and the monsters come out of hiding. (Are they monsters? Who knows). But the flick has Vin Diesel, who I thought fit his role perfectly. But it does lack quite a few parts. Maybe if the writer didnt get in such a rush to get this film made, maybe, just maybe we might have had a classic that would stick with us for years. But its still worth viewing.<br />DVD Special Features Include:<br />* Region 1 encoding (US and Canada only)<BR>* Color, Closed-captioned, DTS Surround Sound, Widescreen, Dolby<BR>* Commentary by director David Twohy and actors Vin Diesel and Cole Hauser<BR>* Commentary by director David Twohy, producer Tom Engelman, and visual effects supervisor Peter Chiang<BR>* Production notes<BR>* Theatrical trailer(s)<BR>* Unrated director's cut features 3 minutes of additional footage<BR>* Making-of featurette (4.5 min.)<BR>* Raveworld Pitch Black event<BR>* Widescreen anamorphic format (2:35:1)
B00005QFHG|3.0|This movie is essentially the same story as George Pal's &quot;The Seven Faces of Dr. Lao,&quot; i.e., mysterious stranger comes to town, offers downtrodden residents insight into whatever ideals Hollywood is pushing this year, is opposed by the forces of conservatism, yadda yadda.  The main difference is this movie is not portrayed as a fantasy, and we are expected to regard the heroine's role as the chocolate fairy hawking her medicinal goodies with absolute seriousness.  If you can do this (and some will do it more easily than others) you then have to look past the cliched, cardboard characters; the ultra-conservative religious civil leader, the degenerate wife beater, the crotchety old dowager with a secret heart of gold.  Once that is done you must look past the blatantly predictable storyline, plot &quot;twists&quot; you can see a mile off and &quot;symbolism&quot; that hits you with the subtlety of a sledgehammer.  If you like Johnny Depp (which I do), be prepared to see his talents wasted as his understated character serves two purposes 1) to serve as a downtrodden misfit whom the heroine can befriend and prove how politically correct (i.e., &quot;good&quot;) she is and 2) to provide a sex scene, which all modern movies must have, because &quot;how can there be love without great sex&quot; asks the modern scriptwriter.<br />After doing all this I concluded that &quot;Chocolat&quot; was an entertaining date movie, but not in any way great art, or even a great film.  See it sometime when you're not feeling too critical and you will be fine.  or better yet, watch &quot;The 7 Faces of Dr. Lao.&quot;  The original is still the best.
B00000JGHM|5.0|Heat is easily one of my all time favorite crime-drama's! Its a really original piece of work from the director Michael Mann. Led with an All-Star cast of Al Pacino (Scarface, The Godfather), Robert De Niro (Taxi Driver, The Godfather Part II) Val Kilmer (Out of Sight, Batman Returns), Tom Sizemore (Saving Private Ryan, Natural Born Killers), Ashley Judd (Double Jeopardy, Someone Like You), Danny Trejo (Animal Factory, Desperado), William Fitchner (Drowning Mona, The Perfect Storm), and Famke Jansen (The Faculty, House on Haunted Hill).<br />The movie is about a mastermind L.A detective (Pacino) on the trail of an equally masterminded thief (De Niro), and his whole crew (Sizemore, Trejo, and Kilmer). One bank, ten minutes, 12.2 million dollars in cash.<br />This film is superb even with lack of special features on the dvd. But the movie is over 3 hours long, and after the credits roll you will feel like it just started. The acting is Oscar calibar, the action is superb, and the script is great. It all makes for a hell of a time, with superb special effects as well.<br />DVD Special Features Include:<br />* Region 1 encoding (US and Canada only)<br />* Color, Widescreen, Dolby<br />* Theatrical trailer(s)<br />* Widescreen anamorphic format (2:35:1)<br />Available to Rent or Buy Today!
B000002OG8|5.0|This is Wishbone Ash's finest moment - it's a wonderful album that takes you through a range of textures and emotions. The guitar work is just superb with tightly woven instrumental harmonies and really interesting songs. This is a rock album you can listen to over and over again and not get tired of it. Both the electric and acoustic guitar playing is first class - &quot;Warrior&quot; followed by &quot;Throw Down The Sword&quot; still knocks me out every time I hear them and I've been playing them since the 1970s!     &quot;Argus&quot; is Wishbone's masterpiece...
0486278077|4.0|After letting his friend Basil Hallward paint a portrait of him, Dorian Gray makes a wish to the heavens above that the the picture would take on all his sins and showings of age and he would remain youthfull and boyish. Throughout the book, Dorian Gray becomes very popular and attracts all sorts of attention just by waltzing into a room. People find him so innocent and pure, he's alluring (which soons turns sour.) But they don't see his other life. His loathing of the once-beautiful portrait which now displays his age, sins and iniquities. This deep hatred drives him to do many strange things in this dark, twisting tale of morale, age and youth. The book follows Dorian through love, loss, murder, disdain, hurt and ofcourse, happiness. Because it covers most every subject, its a wonderful classic, and a must-read.<br />Though because its written in England in the 19th century, some of the vocabulary is bewildering. Its best to read with a dictionary near by or atleast some knowledge of English Literature and diction.
B00003CWOL|5.0|Is &quot;haha&quot; one word or two? Either way. That's how I sum it up: Haha. -A very funny movie. You gotta look past the &quot;fairy tale&quot; side of some of it though. And you also gotta realize they're not making fun of God, or religion. <br />Ben Afleck, and Matt Damon, give a great peformance. They always make a good team. And Jay and Silent Bob are pretty cool too. I highly recommend seeing this one. With an open mind of course.
0679746048|5.0|The year's 1967 and 18-year-old Susanna Kaysen, the book's main character, begins to think that life and reality is just plainly too dense and soon admitts her self, voluntarily, to a mental hospital. She ends up staying there for two years. The book exhibits photocopies of some of her forms. She's shortly labeled as a borderline personality. Throughout the book, Susanna talks about the mind, neurology and her own take on psychology. Her thoughts on hospital-life are very comical. Twenty-five years after her hospital stay at McLean Hospital, Susanna speaks of her doctors, fellow patients and staff at the hospital. <br />Recommended.
0679746048|4.0|Before I read &quot;Girl, Interrupted&quot; I first saw the movie, this is a bad thing because the movie is completely different and actually a little better than the book. <br />I thought Susanna Kaysen was witty at times and able to get her point across about living in a mental hospital for two years but I guess the question that I kept asking myself was &quot;why?&quot; Why did she not like her parents? Why does her first marriage fail? Why does she bond with Lisa? Etc. She provides some insight into her psyche, but not enough in my opinion since I really wanted to know more about her interactions with Lisa, Georgina, and everyone else and instead her audience gets a very nice summary of events without much analysis.<br />So I expected a little too much for this book, don't get me wrong, I really enjoyed it, just wanted more details and analysis.
B00005QK3W|5.0|Now see here- this album is his best work since....The Beatles.  There is not a doubt in my mind.  I've heard ever solo effort he has ever put out and none can compare with this.  Everything clicks- Everything.  If I were to tell you that &quot;Riding into Jaipur&quot; was a &quot;Within you Without you&quot; type of song, would you think it was any good?  Paul? Sitar?- but in actuality, it is a great piece.  He makes so many attempts with different genres and he achieves.  &quot;Your Way&quot; is a slow, somewhat country number, where as &quot;Rinse the Raindrops&quot; is....rock.  Good rock.  New kind of rock you wouldn't expect from him.  And there are more numbers like that.  All in all, it's a very well done album that you should purchase.
B0000027RL|5.0|Pearl Jam has set the standards with there CD &quot;Ten&quot;.  There president will be forever recognized by all other rock bands.  I was introduced to this band by a friend and it turns out that I liked them more than he did.  Every song on this album and every other album of theirs is an immediate hit.  I think everyone should hear Pearl Jam.  They, without a doubt, are the best rock band ever!
0453007902|5.0|Steinbeck created two of the most memorable characters in American literature with the book; Sinise brings them to life with his wonderful narration.  I believe only a paragrah or two was omitted from the book in this recording, so you get the complete story.  I have played parts of this tape for my high school students; it captures their attention instantly.  From my honors students to my students who can barely read, this book is always a favorite, and they all enjoy the power of Sinise's narration.
B000000W5H|3.0|This is a pretty good album.  I stress good, nothing more or less. After Exile on Main Street the Stones left their best stuff behind them, never to return in my opinion. Having said that, they have made some quality stuff in the last thirty years, here and there.  This is one such example.<br />The opening track &quot;If You Can't Rock Me&quot; harkens back to their best days and the title song along with &quot;Time Waits for No One&quot;, &quot;Dance Little Sister&quot;, and &quot;Till the Next Goodbye&quot; are all good. Oddly enough, the album contains one of my very favorite Stones songs in &quot;Fingerprint File&quot; (turn it up!). However, &quot;If You Really Want to Be My Friend&quot;, and &quot;Short and Curlies&quot; seem out of place here and the former is just sappy and not a very good song.  Don't expect greatness. Not even The Stones are perfect, although I know it's hard to believe.
B00004U8P3|5.0|This movie is great. The effects are superb, the plot very entertaining, and it (in my opinion) is better than the book in many parts. You won't be dissapointed.
B000003BEM|5.0|Beginning with this album, The Stones would put together a string of four consecutive studio albums that would be the best of their careers and four of the best in rock and roll history. All four made Rolling Stone magazine's Top 100 albums of all time back in 1987.  <br />Every track on this album is excellent and shows The Stones becoming even more musically creative than they ever had before. &quot;Sympathy for the Devil&quot; is fine and it's one of the more easily recognized songs on the album but there are songs just as good and even better here.  &quot;No Expectations&quot; is a melancholy, primarily acoustic song and &quot;Dear Doctor&quot; is an offbeat, amusing offering.  My personal favorites include &quot;Parachute Woman&quot;, &quot;Jig-Saw Puzzle&quot;, &quot;Prodigal Son&quot; (basically an all acoustic version of the parable that Christ told in Luke 15:11-31), and &quot;Stray Cat Blues&quot;, the most rockin' song on the album. If you're just now getting into The Stones, this is a great place to start.
B00005LOUS|5.0|I think this movie was absolutely wonderful!  I am not a big fan of Jim Carrey's but I was pleasantly surprised (to say the least) at his fantastic portrayal of &quot;The Grinch&quot;.  There is not much negative that can be said for this movie... even after seeing it you didn't enjoy the acting itself you still had to walk away thinking you enjoyed it.  The scenery, is so colorful, and refreshing!.  Whooville is absolutely breathtaking.  It is like something you would see on a Christmas Card, with all of the colors and the snow... I thought it was marvelous, and I can't wait until my order gets here!
B00005RFQ5|5.0|If you think Prince/O{+&gt; ever left, he's back.  If you've noticed moments of brilliance mixed in with some uninspired stuff on his last few releases, this is all gold.  If you love everything he does you don't need to read this, because you're bought this already.<br />The Rainbow Children is a concept album dealing with Prince's vision of utopia and a call for human unity across the major divides of our time (race, religion, economics).  If you're a fan of the man then you know that in one way or another Prince has been preaching this message through music, words, or both for years.  He made a personal spiritual album with Lovesexy all those years ago.  This album, in the sense that it is heavily tied up with the man's views on spirituality, is similar.  Musically however it is often laid back in a soul-jazzy type groove.  Funky but not dirty, sleazy funk (Housequake for example).  This is uplifting funk.  More often than not the guitar sounds are clean and jazz/r&amp;b inspired.  There are still moments of rock mastery though.  In fact it's quite Hendrixian, but not in overly derivative ways.  But one could see Hendrix doing some of this stuff, and you know Prince has heard all of Hendrix's stuff.<br />Even as someone who really enjoyed most of Emancipation I admit the 3 disks were too much and some songs could have been trimmed.  There O{+&gt; was all over the place.  The New Power Generation record I could have lived with out most of, and I really liked Rave Un2 The Joy Fantastic but it wasn't cohesive.  It sounded like something reaching for some airplay (not always a bad thing).  But here the man is FOCUSED!!!<br />The harmony of people is something near and dear to this artist's  heart and he makes an album that can make you think, and can fill you with +ity (positivity for those uninitiated).  Some people may be turned off by Prince talking about God and spiritual matters in language that at times can be a little preachy and if you have strong religious convictions you might not appreciate what he, as one who does not belong to any organized religion, has to say.  However in a time when we all could use a little more peace and love this album brings that message and will put a smile on your face.<br />I don't know if Prince will get as much airplay with this album as he would like, but I defy people to hear this record and not be caught up in his musical and spiritual vision.
B00005KHJR|4.0|Just to clear up any confusion as to whether the Extended Version on this DVD is the definitive &quot;102-minute&quot; version... Every single addition to be found within the 102m version is well documented by Allan Brown in his book Inside the Wicker Man, and this version is IDENTICAL to the Anchor Bay DVD's Extended Version in content. The DVD lists the running time being 99m - thus one can only consider the supposed original &quot;102 minute&quot; cut a miscalculation. With the Limited Edition DVD, you have the most complete version, scene for scene, edit for edit. I've seen the original &quot;102m&quot; cut as shown on the UK Film Four channel earlier this year, and it is one and the same. The only difference is the improved quality of visuals during scenes taken from the Theatrical Version.
0767835255|4.0|The airplane carrying the US President gets hijacked and the president may be the only person who can save the hostage and get the plane down. <br />This is an unrealistic action movie (unfortunately it doesn't seem quite as unrealistic anymore). But if you don't mind unrealistic action movies, which I don't, I am sure you will be very entertained by this movie. It's well written, and very thrilling, with good actors, especially Harrison Ford and Glenn Close. I have seen few action thrillers that were more entertaining than this one. It kept me at the edge of my seat for two hours and a couple of minutes. I highly recommend it! This is action at its best!
630289915X|5.0|Capra manipulates his audience from the first scene. This is not a think for yourself film, not something like Citizen Kane, that is supposed to have the audience leave the theatre already in various discussions or even quarrels.<br />I remember showing this film every winter in an art house when I was in college; afterwards I'd lean out the transom to look over the seats and I'd see the lines of used Kleenex strewn up and down the rows. This is exactly what Capra intended, and he has succeeded.<br />Ironically, it is the jaded audiences of America since the Vietnam War that have embraced this film. When it first came out in 1947, the critics panned it. World War Two had just ended, and the critics, as well as the typical audiences wanted something besides a plain old feel-good movie. It was all very nice that George Bailey &quot;suffered&quot; a mediocre middle class life, so that he could save the lives of his brother, and by him, &quot;the men on the transport,&quot; not to mention the kid with the diphtheria. But this didn't answer any of the questions on people's minds at the time.<br />Right after World War Two, people were dealing with war orphans, and the influx of refugees from concentration camps. 1947 was just about the time that America was coming to terms with what has gone on in places like Buchenwald and Treblinka. Not to mention Hiroshima and Nagasaki.<br />I think the irony is in the fact that the recent audiences have been able to put aside questions of My Lai, the Bay of Pigs, the invasion of Czechoslovakia, The Gang of Four, the Iranian Embassy hostages, Tiannamen Square, the Taliban, Tibet, and focus on the idea that a man is wealthy as long as he has friends. Why is this possible, when contemporary audiences didn't respond to the film?<br />I suppose modern audiences respond with nostalgia, to the old black &amp; white film, with its boxy cars, wind up record player, and corner drugstore. Yes, well, we have the Taliban now, and back then therewere no jumbo jets, or buildings tall enough for a flying plane....<br />The truth is that every time has hard times, and no days were simpler. But nonetheless, this is a great film. Jimmy Stewart and Donna Reed take stock characters and flesh them out, so that the audience cares what happens to them from the moment they appear on the screen. <br />The photography makes the film. The filming and editing are superb. If you have a chance to buy a letterboxed version of the film, do, because it loses so much with the sides cropped off. There are a number of deep-focus shots, and odd angles, designed to show George Bailey from G-d's perspective, or to emphasise the times he is alone in a crowd, or to jolt the audience, to make us uncomfortable and nervous when George Bailey is uncomfortable and nervous. Or sometimes just to give an eye-catching view, as when George holds his hands out before receiving his trunk and says &quot;I want a BIG one!&quot;<br />The crew and the actors have given such close attention to detail, that the film stands up to multiple viewings, so you won't be sorry you bought instead of rented.
B000059MEK|5.0|I'm not the biggest electronic music fan in the world, but I hear a guy across the hall playing the album and I just had to go over and find out who it was.<br />Simply an amazing album.  The first four tracks are exceptional.  The two spotlight reviews say it better than I can.<br />However, I just wanted to stress that this is a wonderful album even if you aren't the biggest electronica fan.<br />I *HIGHLY* recommend that you all procure in any way, shape, or form the music videos for this album.  They're done by a famous Japanese animator, and not only is the anime of great quality, but there's a cool plot weaving in and out that all coordinates perfectly with the songs.  The &quot;One More Time&quot; video does some reallly cool stuff, especially towards the end when the bells toll--there's an awesome flash-freeze-frame thing that is timed perfectly.  If you like the songs, and you like anime or even just quality music videos, you should really DL the videos.  I believe somewhere you can get them all on VCD but I haven't figured that out yet.<br />Anyhow, this is a great album.  So very, very listenable, and it really works well at parties!
B00003CXXJ|5.0|What can I say about Shrek? Almost the entire civilized world knows the story of this movie by now so I'll try to entice you into buying this with what I thought of it. Shrek begins with the ogre [voiced excellently by Mike Myers] scaring some peasants off of his property in his swamp and wishing only to be kept to his privacy. Soon, he discovers that there is a bounty out on all fairy tale creature and are being located to a namely location [Shrek's swamp]. During this Shrek encounters excellent characters all perfectly voiced with a donkey being voiced by Eddie Murphy, Princess Fiona voiced by Cameron Diaz and the Evil Lord Farquaad who is superbly voiced by John Lithgow. There were very few points in this movie that I could not even remotely describe as low. The movie is hilarious as it pokes fun at Disney a lot and was found to be pretty funny. The movie overall does deserves five stars as it lives up to the hype [lack of better word] originally put into it and was ultimately very enjoyable to watch. I could watch this movie again and probably will a great deal of times as it is quite enjoyable.
6304981635|5.0|This Movie is the best martial arts movie of all time. i suggest everyonr buys this cuz its a classic, i mean every one in the worlds seen this movie. I would say this is the best bruce lee movie.
B00005ARDC|3.0|BRMC is a reverberation of popular image conscious rock and roll bands of generations past (ie. Steppenwolf and Oasis) with a bit of alternative ala 80s (Stone Roses and JAMC) and a smidgeon of Texas rockabilly (Cult, Misfits, etc).  No new ground is broken with this record.  If you don't already own it, The Cult's 1984 debut album, Love, is a much better pick for this type of retro genre (The Cult's album was a tribute even then).  That being said, good rock and roll is always refreshing and never goes stale even if it isn't original.  <br />BRMC have some memorable pieces such as the first track, &quot;Love Burns.&quot;  This track has a driving and addictive percussion beat that links music with sexual dynamics as found in good rock tunes in times gone past.  Most of the tunes, however, are overdone and monotonous such as &quot;Awake&quot; which is a never ending bad trip.  <br />BRMC needs to come up with or pinch better riffs to make the heavy feedback pallatible.  Also, in my opinion, BRMC should limit the lyrical content around the standard wild women, substance abuse, and hellraising and abandon attempts at mind expansion.  It doesn't fly...  even with the feedback.<br />I look forward to seeing this band live in a week.  They are the type of band that are probably better live than on CD.
B000001FSR|1.0|I now love Tom Waits, but unlike many of the brilliant reviews already posted about what the album's concept was meant to be, I stumbled onto it without knowing much about the artist and haven't listened to it much since. I thought it was terrible, but perhaps now that I have been enlightened to the wonder of Waits, I will give it another playing.
B00005R2BG|5.0|I went and saw this movie in the theatre. In fact i saw it twice.  I reccomend this movie to anyone who likes music. Moulin Rouge is full of modern music,(everything from Sound of music to maddonna) and the weird thing is the movie  is set back in the late 1800s. It is a crazy movie.  I can describe it best by bringing up the Movie ROMEO AND JULIET, also directed by Baz Luhrman.   If you can reacll the party scene, when everything is fast paced and blured for only a few seconds. Now take that few seconds and spand that over a hour and a half, and thats Moulin Rouge.  Don't worry about it being too confusiing.  It takes some getting used to but you'll be fine.  OH i would like to state i brought my Brother and my dad to this movie.  My brother loves movies like Dumb and Dumber, American Pie, and pretty much every other teen movie, and he hates musicals. My dad loves the meaningful stuff like American Beauty.  The point of me telling you this is to show that this movie is for everyone.  And it'll be a perfect gift.
B000003TAL|5.0|Each time I give this album a run through my headphones, I am taken. on a trip. All the noise and layers of guitars on this album create different images in my mind. It is a very emotional experience. The first song (Teenage Riot)sounds like sort of a party, or &quot;riot&quot;. Things shift in Silver Rocket, a song that sounds like hardcore punk in a way. But you can hear the layers and its just unbelievable. The next 2 songs (The Sprawl, 'Cross the Breeze) are beauliful songs sung my Kim. They're very poetic songs sung from the heart. Erics Trip is a great song by Lee, I alove his lyrics and it has some beautiful noise in it.So does Hey Joni. Total Trash is very pop in a way. But its a awesome song with a very cool guitar riff. Its very catchy, give it a few listens and it'll be in your head all day. The noise solo is like a moment in utopia. Well the whole album is. Its a journey away from reality, yet its a close look at reality. Its hard to explain, you just really need to hear this yourself. Buy this album and let it seduce you.
B000050XEI|5.0|Believe it or not, I have every single CD Enya ever released. This CD is so beautiful same as all others. I'm not saying that I love every single song in this CD, but I mean in general I usually like 90% of the songs in every Enya's CD. Only Time, this song is so unbelievable, it takes you to a whole new world. Only for this song I'd buy this album but most of the songs here touches your heart and put you in perfect mood. If you ever bought a CD for Enya before and liked it then buy this one, you'll love it. Also if you like New Age music like Yanni, Enigma, and Era then you should consider buying this CD and other Enya CDs.
B000002UAX|5.0|This has to be one of my favorite albums/CD`s of all time. Back in the late 1970`s, when I first bought the vinyl edition, it was fashionable to diss the WA in favor of Sgt. Pepper and Abbey Road. Well, those are fun discs, but nothing like this! It`s an exciting cornocopia of differing musical genres and styles, from country to hard rock to the avant-garde. Yes, there are some songs that don`t seem to logically fit, but in general, I really do think that Lennon and McCartney planned the structure of the album to show the band`s amazing range. The result is a bizarre melange of music which includes some of their best and most original work, from &quot;Back in the U.S.S.R&quot; to &quot;Happiness is a Warm Gun&quot; to &quot;Revolution 1&quot;. An auditory feast! Even music lovers who are`nt rabid Beatles admirers have expressed how much they enjoy the Big White one!
B000053GTF|5.0|This DVD is for Celine Dion lovers. It has very nice vedio clips plus a collected songs from previous concerts which makes this DVD the best of Celine Dion on DVD. You can watch it again and again and agian and you'll never get bored. Also I have to mention here that the DVD qality is superb.
B00005JKES|3.0|David Lynch is my favorite director and this is a great show. But this box set is missing the 2 hour pilot episode. That's the episode that sets up the story and introduces the characters. This box set begins with the second episode. Sorry, but that's an incomplete box set and you'll have to buy an import dvd to get the first episode, or watch an old vhs copy. Buyer beware: this isn't the entire \\"first season.\\"<br />Additional Note: I've purchased the region free import DVD from China, the running time is shorter than when originally aired on tv. This is because the transfer was slightly speeded up to make the shorter running time so some of the voices will sound higher pitched. That said, it's the only DVD version I know of. My best bet for the pilot episode is still the VHS \\"movie\\" version from Warner Bros--just make sure to stop it before where the original pilot ended and skip the tacked on ending.
0140186409|5.0|Forget about SAT success, SAT key and other useless stuff -This is the real thing. I raised my verbal by 160 points just after reading it (note that I didn't use any other prep material - just the book!) Considering the fact that I'm an international applicant, and English is not my first language - I guess any IVY-caliber kid should definitely buy it and make sure he memorizes every unknown word he comes across.
B00001NFCY|5.0|Stapp and the gang's heavy-hitting second effort reminds me of Journey's smash hit album with &quot;Separate Ways, Worlds Apart&quot;. It certainly took me &quot;Higher&quot;. Of course, the anthem with the message of sexual fidelity in youth: party and have fun but don't forget life in the fast line can cost. Creed is perhaps the best band to bring morality to Rock and avoid the excesses of the sins of the industry. Not that Bon Jovi and Def Leppard and AC/DC didn't bring Rock's hellatious ways to the pinnacle of success. Creed just does it well. Even though the 80s was THE decade of Rock-n-Roll, Creed gives us memories of what once was and currently, sorrowfully, isn't. Creed is the group Journey of today.<br />A+++++++++++++++++<br />Felecia Constance Rowe<BR>Chairwoman and CEO<BR>Teardropfilms, Ltd.
B0000024YL|5.0|This 1972 compilation contains the best early songs written by Paul Simon and sung by both Simon and Garfunkel. Highlights include the etheral and haunting &quot;Bridge Over Troubled Water&quot; and the classic upbeat &quot;Mrs. Robinson&quot; (who can forget &quot;The Graduate?  The song was originally titled &quot;Mrs. Roosevelt&quot;).  &quot;Homeward Bound&quot; is a lonely heart tugger and &quot;America&quot; has recently taken on an entirenew meaning for a new generation since David Bowie sang it at the Paul McCartney Fund-raiser in New York recently.
0736655220|5.0|Whatever you do, DO NOT(!) rent or buy the Books On Tape version of this great book.  The reader does not know when to appropriately emphasize, inflect, or pace the reading.  I was extremely disappointed because the book was a blast.  Buy the book--ignore the tapes!  Let's hope the next reading (HINT, HINT) gets it right.
1559408855|5.0|This film is not an exploitation film. Anyone that watches it based on that assumption is missing the whole idea of the movie. Pasolini made this film as an indictment of society, culture, and history. The film is about fascism, neo-fascism, and capitalism, and the images on the screen are not to be taken at face value, but as metaphors for contemporary society and politics. The sexual depravity shown on the screen, the coprophagy, the torture, it is all symbolic. For example, the children in the film are forced to eat excrement becuase Pasolini believed that contemporary culture and society was excrement, and thus was force feeding us, the consumer, with excrement.<BR>The most interesting aspect of this film is that Pasolini, a homosexual, linked homosexuality with death and fascism. Why after portraying homosexuality in a beautiful way in his earlier works did Pasolini change his tune, nobody knows. Some think he lost his mind while making this movie.<BR>Many don't like the film because Pasolini makes the victims out to be emotionless and doesn't allow us to pity them. But thats just what he wanted! By watching the movie, we are like the victims, allowing ourselves to be abused and also being a spectator to abuse. Again, everything in this film is done for a reason.<BR>Before watching this film you should be familiar with de Sade, Dante's Inferno, and have some basic understanding of fascism and its history. If you lack any of these three elements, don't watch the movie because you will not get it at all. Again, don't watch this movie at face value. It is one of the sickest, most disturbing films ever made, and it is that way for a reason. Not for shock value or to get banned in country after country, but to make a statement. This film is so dangerous that it is believed by many that Pasolini was assassinated for making it. If everyone got this movie, the world would be in deep trouble.
B00005R2IS|5.0|...not only do we get all the great features that we associaite with a DVD (Theatrical trailers, TV spots, documentary featurettes, audio commentaries, etc.) but it will also include the original Austrailian soundtrack, something I NEVER thought I would see during my lifetime. (Most people already know that when the film was released theatrically in the United States in 1979, Filmways, the movie's U.S. distributor, dubbed the Australian actors with Mid Atlantic voices).  The film was, of course, availabe at one time on DVD from Image Entertainment (it is now out of print); there was also a Japaneese Region 2 NTSC DVD that was released, although I admittedly have not seen that version (I have yet to own an all code DVD player).  I've also noticed a legimimate VCD version of the movie put up for auction on Ebay.  Now, with MGM / UA Video releasing this version on DVD to North American audiences..., the movie is getting the treatment it so richly deserves.

B00005LOUQ|1.0|This is not for kids.  Was Jim Carrey ad libbing his way through the movie?  For two hours?  The humor is either for juveniles, or non-existent.  The Grinch's antics are rude and off-putting.  The story-line is poor.  What a horrible thing to do to the classic animated Grinch.
B00005R2M3|3.0|As many other Latin artists eager to gain new fans in new territories, Shakira has produced her first album of (mostly) English songs, which (unfortunately) for someone already accustomed to hearing her in Spanish sound...different. <br />Somehow her melancholic lyrics and defiant voice I got used to (love!) in her Spanish songs become less convincing and beautiful. But I do understand the enourmous potential of English speaking markets so I'm expecting Laundry Service to do fairly well against Britney Spears, Jennifer Lopez and the like minded. I hope she'll continue writing songs in Spanish since that's where you discover the uniqueness of her music. &quot;Que me Quedes Tu&quot; and &quot;Suerte&quot; are well written and composed songs...I like them a lot. I give Laundry Service 3 stars as value for money.
B00005QGAX|5.0|This album has so many hits that it wouldn't be fair to call it an album, but more like a Greatest Hits compilation. This album spawned 6 #1 hits, and some of the best music videos ever. From the funky &quot;Bad&quot; to the confessional &quot;Leave Me Alone&quot;, there is hip grooves and heart-pulling ballads the whole way through. All of MJ's albums are classic, but if you only want one or two MJ albums, I'd get this and OFF THE WALL. THRILLER is great as well but it cannot equal the energy and power of this album. Special editions have been released of OFF THE WALL, THRILLER, BAD, and DANGEROUS and I purchased all of them. They have great outtakes and interviews of Quincy Jones and Rod Temperton (Temperton is only on OFF THE WALL and THRILLER, and DANGEROUS has no extras for the music takes up all of the CD space). All of the special editions are also digitally remastered and include rare photographs. The outtakes on this album are particularly great, with the funky and energetic &quot;Streetwalker&quot;, a beautiful Spanish version of &quot;I Just Can't Stop Loving You&quot;, and the pretty ballad &quot;Fly Away&quot;. So what are you waiting for? GO OUT AND BUY THIS ALBUM TODAY!<BR>If you liked this album, also get other Michael Jackson albums like OFF THE WALL, THRILLER, DANGEROUS, HIStory, BLOOD ON THE DANCE FLOOR, and the brand-new incredible INVINCIBLE. You will be pleased.

B000002JSJ|4.0|Like other bands that have become part of the legend of modern popular music (the Beatles, Stones etc.) it is often difficult to seperate the myth of Zeppelin from the reality. They have cast a shadow over rock music like a shadow cast over the earth by the giant balloon which inspired their name. Yes they were often brilliant but like the Beatles and Stones, die-hard fans seem  unable to accept that they ever produced anything that was less than perfect. Yet they did and &quot;Prescence&quot; was where the cracks started to show. Zep's first six albums were virtually faultless notwithstanding a slight dip in quality control on &quot;Physical Graffiti&quot; due to the work being spread over a double album. Prescence was not their best and was followed by the inferior &quot;In Through The Out Door.&quot; Then all that was left was the mopping up exercise of &quot;Coda&quot; before the band called it a day following the untimely death of Bonham.<br />So, if &quot;Prescence&quot; does not have quite the spark of the earlier works it still has many great moments to shame a band of lesser stature than Zeppelin. &quot;Achilles Last Stand&quot; is an epic rolling trip through time changes. &quot;For Your Life&quot; is a gentler track showing their always present softer side in an updated form. Most impressive of all is &quot;Nobody's Fault But Mine&quot; recalling the early blues style of their debut. The track is all about dynamics; Page's guitar riff crashes in and then hangs in the air before dying away, Plant seems unable to stop the words falling from his mouth in an orgiastic escape. The rhythm section particularly Bonzo's drums tumble forward like an avalanche but are always held back in the most impressive display of controlled power. The whole track seems to breath like a sleeping monster aroused and then placated. For moments like this which remind us of what Zeppelin were capable of, &quot;Prescence&quot; is worthy of a place in any worthwhile record collection.

1568495110|5.0|Two versions of this book are in circulation.  One version, the one originally created by Burgess, has changed many lives for the better and fulfilled many people's views of society and culture.  The other version, the one published in America, is an incomplete and bastardized version of Burgess's original.  The ending is changed 100% because the American publishers left the last chapter out of the book.  <br />Burgess wrote the book in a format of 3 parts with 7 chapters apiece to add up to 21 chapters.  The story is about a boy named Alex who grows up defying society and its laws.  Without the final chapter of the book the true ending, and the true future of Alex's fate, is not revealed.  Many people who have read this version are left feeling ill and doubtful about the direction of youth.  <br />Burgess also created his own language (Nadsat) in the writing of this book.  It is slang that the characters use (many of the words are based from Russian) and is easilly tripped over in the beginning.  It took me two hours to read the first twelve pages of the book (using the glossary in the back), but after that I could read it easily.  <br />I hope this review helps you in making your selection.  Good luck, and happy reading.
0385505833|5.0|This is not the usual Grisham lawyer book. It's a funny quick read. Very enjoyable. I would even let my middle school child read without being embrassed by content or language. I can see this as a TV movie with Alan Alda.
B00005OM4N|4.0|Hey, I love Brit, and almost worship the ground she walks on, but I have to admit it's not the best ever. The music is very upbeat, and despite her saying how she's going for an older audience, a lot of the songs still have her upbeat tune. For fans, it's an awesome buy. For those who never really liked her, this won't make you like her better.
B00005RFQ5|5.0|No matter what the religion you believe in, color or creed this is the ultimate truth : music, thru this amessage  of love and understanding that arrived is those times of hatred and war.... Bring on the funk to the \\"banished ones\\" maybe some can be saved... I'm not a believer in the tyical sense but it doesn't matter because I believe in what we should all do love aech other and stay positive if this is God and the truth well i am a believer! but for sure I believein Prince and this album is a milestone! Rave unto the love fantastic!
B00005OM4N|5.0|The new Britney CD is amazing.  It has a new sound and beat that sounds great.  In my opinion, this CD is her best yet.  The new sound seems to fit her, and the songs are awesome.  The 'Britney' CD is always being played in my house, because I never get sick of the songs.  They're all so unique and catchy, that you can't get enough.  If you're gonna buy a CD, buy this one!!  ...The new songs are all great and any Britney fan, and even those that aren't, will love this CD.  The new songs are all great new sound that Britney is exploring and it suits her great.  THIS IS MY ALL TIME FAVORITE CD, SO BUY IT!!!!  It's just the greatest!  I can't get enough of it!!!
B000059PQ2|5.0|Phenomena hooked me right away, even the momentary twinge I felt when the monkey made its appearance (I hate monkeys, especially monkeys in &quot;horror&quot; movies) was short lived; this monkey is actually a device to move the plot along and never overstayed its welcome.  The tension continues to build up, right up to the end, which was a nice surprise.  Many elements from prior Argento films make appearances here and everything just works.<br />Inferno is the third and final chapter of the Deep Red trilogy and the second and, so far, final chapter in the proposed Three Mothers trilogy.  Inferno suffers from the &quot;Jan Brady&quot; syndrome.  She is beautiful and accomplished in her own right, but she follows an even more beautiful and equally accomplished sister.  It is easy to be so dazzled by Suspiria that Inferno is obscured in her shadow.  But upon a second viewing, the scales fall and the ears become unplugged and Inferno proves to be her sisters equal.  Its simply that Suspiria is a fairy-tale whereas Inferno is a symphony.<br />Phenomena includes a trailer, a couple of music videos, the first of which is absolutely mesmerizing, and an interview.<br />Inferno includes an introduction by Dario Argento, that unfortunately comes off as an apology, a trailer, and an interview segment.<br />This gift set, in fact, all three volumes of the Dario Argento collection, represent a tremendous value.  Just compare the price of buying these two DVD's separately.  This is now the DVD's golden age.  Enjoy it while it lasts.
B000050XEI|3.0|I'm a big Enya fan but I was a little disappointed by this album.  There are a few songs on here that I heard and then had to have the CD... but I found that those songs were the only ones that I really liked.  It's nice and mellow but not their best in my opinion.
B000002UJQ|5.0|This album is totally revolutionary, since the Sgt Peppers Lonely Hearts Club Band (The Beatles), the sound is incredible, new, fresh.

B00003CXZ4|5.0|I am amazed at how many people do not know about this film.  Leonard has a &quot;condition.&quot;  His wife was raped and killed sometime ago.  He can only remember events up to that incident.  He can remember some short term events, but only for a few minutes;  he can't make new memories.  How in the world is he going to find his wife's killer and bring him to justice with this condition?  'Memento' is a rarity:  it's a great action film, a suspense film, and a mystery.  But that's not all:  the characters are interesting, the acting is excellent, and the movie makes you think.  And think.  And think some more.  The film is so good I watched it twice and will probably watch it again.  Like probably a lot of other viewers, I found myself thinking, &quot;What if this happened to me?&quot;  The film entertains and causes you to examine and evaluate your own memory.  The film also contains the best last line of the year.  Highly recommended!
B000002TQV|5.0|Simply Radiohead is amazing, great album... a classic ...<BR>buy it...
B00005OM4N|5.0|Yess! I have been waiting for this CD for a very long time. What can I say about it? I have a lot of thoughts and feelings - but main one is - IT IS GREAT. I love Britney so much! She is wonderful. More than her I love only Vanessa Paradis and Beethoven. And this is first Britney's CD I like completely - all songs are beautiful. ALL (!!!)<BR>Britney go on! I love you!!!
B00003CXXJ|2.0|Shrek, has it's good points but it is completely not suitable for children, there are noticable sexual jokes throughout the entire movie.  I saw it with my 8 year old neice, and believe me, she knew what they where talking about, and the reason that she does is because she has seen it on TV.  It's sad when you can't take a young child to a supposedly family friendly movie, because it is too inapropriate.  Shrek didn't need to throw in adult humour to satisfy the parents, it would have been a completely enjoyable movie with out those kind of jokes.
0066620996|5.0|I believe this book is brilliant (how often does one get a business book based on a broad set of DATA, and not assertions or a few case studies?) but it is not meant to be everything to everyone.<br />It will not help a struggling company out of the dark ages.  If you're looking for help with cash flow, basic business processes, stock pricing or market share or profitability or any of those many things we all sit at our desks worrying about 12 hours a day, don't look in here.  The title says it all:  GOOD to GREAT.  That implies that you have to start with GOOD.  Fortunately, Amazon carries a bushel basket of other titles which address these kinds of problems.<br />What this book can do, however, is give even the struggling corporation some sense of down-the-road planning.  You might be fighting with the Board on a daily basis over executive compensation...this book says forget that, focus on getting the right executives hired.  (So true!)  You might be struggling with prioritization of your projects for next year.  This book will remind you how to refocus on your core competencies, so that you might not try that new product launch which really is outside your scope, no matter how tempting the margins look.  Much of it IS aspirational (after all, how many of us really do work for good companies, especially in this economy?) but it allows us to remember some key, proven factors (remember that it is based on data) which might help us manage better day-to-day.<br />And isn't that the point of a business book, anyway?
B000001EKX|5.0|Somehow, this album is overlooked. I mean, this has got classics like the title track, Goin' Blind, Parasite, All The Way, Let Me Go Rock n Roll, Got To Choose, Strange Ways, Mainline, Comin' Home & Watchin' You. WAIT A MINUTE! I just listed the ENTIRE album! Take that as a hint people. This is THE best Kiss album of all time. And I've been a Kiss freak since the beginning & I know what I'm talkin' 'bout Willis!!
B00003CXXI|5.0|This movie was incredible touching, humorous and down right entertaining.  Don't let the &quot;animation&quot; aspect of this film fool you.  The film is a must see for all ages.  Mike Myers and Eddie Murphy present themselves as a dynamic duo in this film.  From the small amount of potty mouth humor to the incredibly touching love story; the film has something for everyone.  But hey, don't take my word for it, go out and see it for yourselves.  I guarantee you'll be having it on your christmas list as a must have video for this year.
B00004XQ83|4.0|In fact, I'm listening to it right now on my Windows Media Player, after having copied it to my hard drive and adding it to one of my playlists.  I would be interested in knowing how you could prevent a copy of a .cda format.  If nothing else, you could tape the darned thing and copy it from there.  Sometimes, you can have trouble if the cd is interactive (I had trouble with a Fiona Apple CD awhile back)<br />But enough about that.  This has some great songs on it.  If you hate bluegrass, stay away.  But for those of us that like it, it has some very soulful, inspired tunes on it the like of which I haven't heard in years.  My personal faves are I'll Fly Away, Didn't Leave Nobody but the Baby, Big Rock Candy Mountain, and, of course, A Man of Constant Sorrow.  Does have a clinker or two, however, but it's WELL worth the money.
0375420525|5.0|This book tears you down into a world unthinkable. I just plainly enjoyed the utter complexity of the writing and composition of the book. But remember it is a novel in the fiction section.
B00005RIKD|4.0|Was Sting trying to tell us something by sitting in front of a weathered door for the cover of this CD? It's obvious that he's fighting (or celebrating) the passage of time by dragging out some of his classic tunes retooled in aggressively new interpretations.  But that's okay with me, like that weathered door, these songs are still sturdy. Particularly good were &quot;Fragile.' &quot;A Thousand Years&quot; and &quot;Roxanne&quot; which gets a funky yet more mournful retelling.
B00003CX5P|5.0|Many people that claim to be Star Wars fans are venomously against this movie.  I don't understand it - this is a very worthy addition to the Star Wars universe.  The fun is there (&quot;I have a bad feeling about this&quot;), the action is there (especially the lightsabre duels - far superior to any of the previous ones), and the movie is a fun experience.  All the SW movies are thin on plot and have hokey dialogue - why are people upset that this one should too?<br />The main problem with this film is that we already know the end (Return of the Jedi).  SW fans will consider these films as history.  There's little suspense in Darth Maul vs. Obi-wan because we know Obi-wan lives another 30 years!  Similarly, Anakin is obviously going to survive the pod race and the space battle, because he lasts until RotJ.  By the same argument, we cannot shed tears for other characters that we know are dead in the &quot;present&quot; - Amidala, Qui-gon, Mace Windu, etc.  Thus, some dramatic tension is lost.  Having said that, though, the fun of SW is the action and immersion in the Galaxy Far, Far Away.<br />The DVD edition is fantastic, even if you think the movie is sub-par.  There are numerous behind-the-scenes features, all of which give a nifty inside look at the making of the film.  Especially interesting is the look at the digital manipulation of people and places.  Parts are very impressive - Coruscant, the Gungan city, etc.  Others need some work - Jar Jar is the most obvious.  There's something very unnatural about the way he moves, occasionally defying the laws of physics, and he's distracting in the background because he moves too much.  The cut scenes are fun to see, the commentary is full of tidbits and features George Lucas and several others (including ILM fixture Ben Burtt), and a neat 3-way split-screen feature on how storyboards are brought to the screen.  There's also the obligatory ads (both TV and cinema), some of which I never saw before, and the video for Duel of the Fates.<br />The combination of a pretty good movie on a great DVD full of extras makes this the jewel of my DVD collection, and highly recommended.
B00003JRCQ|5.0|The first time I watched this on the BBC I was bored. I'm a guy and romantic stories don't usually excite me much if at all - I'd never had an single interest in Austen until I saw the BBC 1995 edition of Pride and Prejudice - I only watched an episode by accident and by the end I was hooked, I went out and bought the video and I absolutely loved it, and it's still my favourite costume drama. I loved the film of Sense and Sensibility too and when I came to watch this I was expecting something of the same -and I was disappointed.<br />However, the ending had me hooked, and I watched the entire film again. And again. And again - and I've watched it dozens of times and I have to say it's absolutely wonderful. Its also incredibly subtle - and this is the reason why this film is so underrated, much like Austen's books were for almost a century. Once you get a grip on what the drama is about, you'll be spellbound by the breathtaking subtlety of the characters actions and motivations, the agony of Anne Elliot as she not only has to meet the long lost love of her life but listen to his attractiveness and flirting with the Musgrove girls and the pain that she suffers as a result - the dinner scene is perfect in this, and when Wentworth says &quot;I had no wife in the year (18)06&quot;, and the camera cuts to Anne's face.<br />Whilst &quot;Pride &amp; Prejudice&quot; and &quot;Sense and Sensiblity&quot; are immediate, in your face drama, this is subtle and understated, but equally as powerful and dramatic. Those drama's are fine to watch a few times, but quickly lose their charm, whereas this one only increases with enjoyment the more times you watch it, and the more times you watch it the more you understand and the more you see in it - and the more amazing it becomes. Not because of the romantic side (hey, I'm a guy, what did you expect?) but because of the wonderful sensitivity and incredible intelligence of Austen's drama. This really ought to among Amazon's Essential list of videos.
B000000WJK|5.0|The title is perfect.  It's mellow, chill, psychedelic...heaven.  On the other hand, it rocks.  Guitars soaring off into space, Ashcroft's voice rising and falling, stretching from peak to peak admist an intense, beautiful clamour...a storm.  <BR>    I would love to disect this album, listen to each instrument as it's own entity in order to better understand how so many sounds and directions have been woven into a flawless tapestry.  The songs glide gracefully into one another, melting from one track to the next, until it spirals into silence.
B00005QK3W|5.0|Being a longtme Beatles fan who has the entire Beatles music catalog, I must admit when I found out Macca was coming out with a new album that I eagerly awaited it's release and I can honestly say that this Driving Rain CD is a joy to listen to.  It has a varied texture to it with the typical McCartney experimentation that makes the album interesting.  To me, this album harkens back to a time when theme albums like Sargeant Pepper were popular.  I am sure Paul did not mean to write a theme album. But the songs when listened to in order on the cd have a common fabric about the human spirit to them.  You will experience sadness, happiness, hope, charm and patriotism from one of the most influential composers of the 21st century!  I know some reviewers write that Paul's lyrics in this CD are not very deep, but to me they worked.  I think when we learn that Paul McCartney is coming out with a new CD we sometimes expect the coming of the next Messiah or something.  Relax! He is a musican and music should be fun.  Turn to religion for your deeper meaning to life.  Have fun with this music as it is surely that.  The songs are interesting and fun and to me that is worth the price of admission anyday of the week!<br />Buy it and enjoy the music of one of the greatest musicians of all time!
B000001GQB|3.0|While these symphonies are impeccably done, the tempo is much too slow and deliberate for me.
B00000DFMM|5.0|Although I'm a fervent admirer of Depeche Mode, OMD, New Order and Human League, I have to admit that this album tops anything I own from the eighties, even Depeche's masterpiece &quot;Black Celebration&quot;. I think I must have listened to this cd a thousand times, and think I'll never get tired of listening to it. These songs were constructed with such perfection! and it's the debut &amp; farewell album by this great german Industrial-Techno-Pop group (I'm not taking in account the later album &quot;1-2-3-4&quot;, because it didn't feature the original group). &quot;Duel&quot; is one of those classic songs that stick to you forever, with gorgeous vocals by Claudia Br&uuml;cken, and just the same can be said of the rest of the cd, especially &quot;Dr. Mabuse&quot;, a wonderfully dramatic song, and &quot;P Machinery&quot;. Do yourself a favour and be introduced to the definitive techno-masterpiece of the eighties, and it deserves ten stars!!!
B000002VQQ|5.0|Horses is typically labled punk, or at the very least rock. In truth the album is neither; Patti Smith's music is it's own genre, earmarked by poetry, passion, piano, and guitars used to create an entity that stands apart.<BR> As a poet, Smith's writings can be abstract and difficult to connect with, but when formed into song, the spirit and passion behind them is evident enough to make the listener understand what she wants to commuincate, and the vitatility of her message.<BR> Her voice wails and shrieks throughout the record, a soft vibratto making itself known during quieter moments while her primal growl dominates throughout. Her live performances serve as proof that when singing, she really is transported to another place, one the listener can easily get sucked into, be it during the driving chant of &quot;Horses,&quot; or &quot;Birdland,&quot; which paints an intensely vivid picture through narrative. <BR> If you love Horses, it will be a favorite and respected album in your collection, and how others can brush it aside of find it unlistenable for the very reasons that make it one of rock's greatest accomplishments, will be impossible to understand.
B00005Q66T|3.0|I have to admit that I'm not the biggest Madonna fan.  I like her music and have for years, I'm just not as big of a fan as most who would buy this.  But, I do have to say that the idea of owning her entire collection of hits is appealing.  This CD is simply not enough of a follow up to Imac. Collection.  There are way too many songs missing.  Even when compared to her Greatest Hits DVD, which has some songs this doesn't.  Maybe it's time for a multi disc Madonna box set?
B00003CXXS|4.0|First off, I'll say that I spent about a year at Dan's JP3 Page, anxiously anticipating this film.  I have always been a huge JP fan and believe it or not, I loved The Lost World.  After the long period of waiting and speculating, July 18th came and I rushed to theaters.  I sat in my seat, giddy as a schoolboy about the new addition to one of my two favorite series (along with Star Wars.)  Was the waiting worth it?  Was the movie even that good?  Could Joe Johnston make a movie worthy of the name &quot;Jurassic Park&quot;?<br />After seeing JP3 for the first time, I said to myself &quot;eh...it was pretty good.&quot;  I thought it wasn't as good as the other two JPs, thought the plot was stupid, and missed the T-Rex.<br />I saw it again later.  I LOVED IT AFTER THAT.  When first watching this film, it is normal to expect something in perticular.  What many fail to recognize is this:<br />JP3 was a fantastic movie for being a sequel.<br />Sure, it doesn't match to awe and wonder of Steven Speilbergs original masterpeice, but it was a great sequel.  Everything in it was fresh: The new intelligent raptors, brand new characters, the Spinosaur, the pteranodons, the para-sailing.  EVERYTHING WAS FRESH.  I never expected it to lose all the things we had gotten so used to in the first 2 to be gone.  Plus, it had a different mood, which I didn't expect.<br />JP3 was an excellent sequel.  So many sequels are crap these days and JP3 was far better than that.  Keep that in mind while your watching it on DVD instead of thinking about how it compares to the original.  :D
B000002LGQ|5.0|I think this was the turning point for Madonna.  This CD had the most creative and unique work up to that date, and is still my favorite of all her work.  It was the first CD where I thought of Madonna as a real talent, not just a fad.  Growing up in the time of the Material Girl, I consider her a real sign of my generation.  This CD proved that Madonna had the talent to be around for a long time.  I would say that much like the Beatles did Sgt. Pepper and forever went from the pop fad to music legends, Maddona's Like a Prayer ended the Like a Virgin phase and turned her into one of the most respected performers of our time.  Madonna has changed many times in her career, but never at this much of an increase of quality.  I'm curious to see if she has a White Album in her?
020530902X|2.0|e.b. white was one of my favorite authors when i was a kid, but i dunno, something just tells me that he should have stuck to being a great novelist.  this is a nerd-book, mildly toxic for the obsessive-compulsive within us all.<br />after reading it (and skimming parts), i came to the conclusion that while much of what they said has its merit (as i too get peeved when a book or article uses poor style), this book is really not that important.  it's the heart of a book that counts, and many a great heart has faulty valves and cholesterol deposits.  take gandhi's autobiography:  stylistically deadly, but a heart of gold within.  granted, a strunk-and-whiter could have edited it up a few notches, but it would have been the same book deep within.<br />my final take:  buy this book if it's in the dollar bin, and skim if you have a spare hour.  but if writing's in your blood, strunk and white won't make much of a difference.
B000002UAU|2.0|It is primarily nostalgia on the part of 40+ year olds that results in the high ratings for this album.  The times were different and the cover of this album was a breakthough.  Unfortunately, the music contained herein wasn't so inspiring, as it is dominated by ditties such as With A Little Help From My Friends, Fixing A Hole, and When I'm 64, and supposed innovation on Lucy in the Sky, Mr. Kite and A Day in the Life.  Other bands were producing much better music, and this record really hasn't stood the test of time.  Sounds dated.  2-stars.
0385505833|4.0|Get the fire satrted, throw a few chestnuts on and read this little novella next to it.  It's fun, fast and gets you into the Christmas spirit.
B000002UAR|2.0|Aside from Dr. Robert, Taxman, and And Your Bird Can Sing this album is just boring.   Eleanor Rigby and Here There and Everywhere are orchestra tunes.  Tomorrow Never Knows is barely musical, and is characterized by a faint melody and Lennon's whiney voice.  Yellow Sub is stupid.  Love You To is Harrison's self indulgence, forcing a sitar on the previously good Beatles formula when no one asked for it.  I agree that this was a turning point, but it was in the wrong direction. Stay with the earlier albums. 2-stars
1570429596|5.0|Somewhere in the back your mind, you knew there was something about money that you just weren't catching onto.  Rich Dad, Poor Dad puts it all in perspective.  If you have grown up believing that the American dream of a $60,000 per year job, a house, and a mortgage are all you need; then this book will shatter your dreams, anger you, or give you a whole now vision of what money is and how you should use it.  This is one of the most elightening books I've ever read.
B00005RFAI|5.0|Pink can finally be undaztood after getting rid of all those unnecessary beats that she had of her debut album by making her sophomore album just a step forward to rock. When I heard pink was changing her genre to rock, I thought that she was going to do the Mandy Moore thing were she just put instruments behind pop songs, but Pink kept her word. This is Pinks best move yet and its going to make her career prosper even more. Pink wrote 11 out of the 14 songs on this album in which she put her every emotion into them unlike those R&amp;B tracks that she did which weren't bad, its just that you didn't learn or grow by listening to them. <br />Track Listing:<br />1.) Missundaztood - This is a hot track that pink laid down for us with a great chorus and you can tell that she was having great fun when she recorded this track. This track is just one of those feel better about yourself track, and it sure brightens up my mood.<br />2.) Don't Let Me Get Me - This track is very meaningful and I can definitely relate in understanding that some days you just don't like yourself and other days you do. Pink actually gives a shout out to our friend Britney Spears in this song.<br />3.) Just Like A Pill - This is by far one of the most promising tracks on this album, this track is off the hook, you can feel Pinks inner emotions in this song. This song has a great chorus and when she states &quot;And I swear you're just like a pill, instead of making me better you keep making be ill&quot; I think she expresses the metaphor very well. <br />4.) Get The Party Started - Pink was smart to choose this track as her first single because it definitely shows her new rock side and still has a pinch of her old R&amp;B side.<br />5.) Respect feat. Scratch - In this track pink claims its rap but I am still feeling the strong rock vibe from it.<br />6.) 18 Wheeler - This song is very interesting, its a song that you wouldn't expect a women to sing, but more power to you, Pink.<br />7.) Family Portrait - This is a very sad and tragic song but its also very true and pink just lays down all the facts that people find disturbing to listen to. Pink is basically saying that not all families are happy.<br />8.) Misery Feat. Steven Tyler of Aerosmith - This song is really as good as its anticipation claimed it to be, they both work the heck out of this song with there misery sounding like vocals in front of a jazz/blues beat.<br />9.) Dear Diary - I know that Britney Spears' &quot;Dear Diary&quot; put a bad name on any song of the same title but Pink's Dear Diary is really sweet and meaningful, and all she really wants to do is tell it her secrets.<br />10.) Eventually - This song is another sad jazz./blues song, it good to hear an artist share her pain because sometimes the fans are going through the same thing.<br />11.) Lonely Girl feat. Linda Perry - The beat and the way Pink's vocals flow in this song are very sweet and beautiful and you can feel what she was feeling. Linda Perry who helped co-write a few of the songs on this album is actually featured singing the chorus.<br />12.) Numb - This is a hard core rock song and you can hear all the aggression Pink is expressing in this song.<br />13.) Gone To California - Any song about California is good, California is a nice place, this song features many jazz/blues beats in it. This track is off the hook.<br />14.) My Vietnam - This is a very meaningful song, its up to you on how you interpret it but Pink sounds very serious about this song.<br />I am so proud of Pink's work and she has me really looking forward to her next album. This album is a masterpiece of great expression, and I just wanted to share with the world how great this music makes a person feel and what your missing out on if you don't have it.
B000002KIE|5.0|The Sex Pistols debut album is amazing. Johnny Rotten's raw vocals, Steve Jones' simple, hard guitar sounds. Paul Cook's loud, bangy drumkit, and both Sid Vicious' and Glen Matlock's barely heard bass tunes mix together to form songs by a punk pioneering band. This was the early days of punk rock, and songs like these are classics and forever. The anarchy, no future, destroy message is heard and loud and clear. HOLIDAYS IN THE SUN opens up the album to carry on to songs like the hardcore, punk epic song BODIES along with simple songs like NO FEELINS and PROBLEMS. Politically motivated tunes like GOD SAVE THE QUEEN along with hateful songs against things like the record company EMI and mad anarchy songs like PRETTY VACANT and ANARCHY IN THE UK all mix together in a breathtaking debut. Any punk fan, or music fan, shouldn't miss this!
B00005QK3W|4.0|Driving Rain is not the best album in McCartney's career, but is a good album in comparison to the rest of the music that is produced by now. Maybe the big mistake in this effort is the attemp to sound 'simple', instead of a big and complex production, and the result of this approach are songs that sound just like demos.<BR>But the genius of McCartney remains, one example is the amazing &quot;Loving Flame&quot;, an epic ballad in the mood of &quot;My love&quot;. Another gem is &quot;About you&quot;, with is a rocker with solid instrumentaion. &quot;I do&quot;, &quot;Tiny bubble&quot; and &quot;Heather&quot; are good selections. One favorite of mine is &quot;Rinse the raindrops&quot;, one of the most crazy records from McCartney to date.<BR>In the other side &quot;From a lover to a friend&quot; is one of the weakest songs that I ever heard, what a shame that this was the first single.
B000002JS8|4.0|Bon Scott's career-best vocals and the swaggering confidence of the production go a long way to masking the fact Highway To Hell can't hold it's own with its classic predecesors Powerage and Let There Be Rock.  The big, jaunty FM-friendly production is immediately evident on the crisp, clear opening bars of the title track. That production itself is not the problem, although its a million miles from the snarling pared-down boogie of Let There Be Rock or the raw introspective blues of Powerage but  rather its the simple matter of the quality of the songs.  The title track and Touch To Much aside, repeated plays reveal tracks like Shot Down In Flames, Beating Around The Bush and If You Want Blood to be anodyne, formulaic and short on hooks when compared to the addictively tuneful killer riffs showcased on classics like Bad Boy Boogie, Riff Raff, Whole Lotta Rosie or Up To My Neck In You.  This was the beginning of AC/DC makers of multi-platinum anthemic, party-rock and the end of an altogether darker, dirtier, leaner and meaner rock n' roll band.
B00005BJ2O|4.0|I bought this CD shortly after seeing the film back in May, because I was absolutely amazed by the colors, the singing, the dancing...it took my breath away. I can't imagine that it didn't do well with critics...so much imagination went into compiling these songs! What other musical can you listen to and already know the words? <BR>The only comlaints I have of this CD (and the movie) is that there were not more duets and solos by Ewan and Nicole...the tracks of them singing are the highlights of Moulin Rouge. Some of the songs I could do without (the Gloria Estefan song) and I REALLY wish they would have used John Leguizamo's version of 'Nature Boy'...this just wasn't a David Bowie kind of tune. The Fat Boy Slim song is also great if you're a fan of his...it really gets in to your head!<BR>  Overall, this is a very entertaining CD, especially if you've seen the movie and don't want it to end!
B000002JST|5.0|Although some maintain that this album's greatest tracks achieved definitive treatment on If You Want Blood, the fact remains that Let There Be Rock houses AC/DC two most famous moments, the monolithic Let There Be Rock and the incendiary Whole Lotta Rosie.  Let There Be Rock is a dark, taut, sinewy record without a second of flab.  In it's hard-driving, head down way, its as heavy and relentless as any releases by more self-consciously heavy groups like Metallica. From the authentically sleazy Go Down, via the kerosene-soaked riffage of Bad Boy Boogie and Hell Ain't A Bad Place To Be to the final blast of Rosir, there is no let up, no escape, with only Dog Eat Dog weighing in as less than classic.
B000002MUN|4.0|One of the few 70's rockers still producing fresh-sounding rock, Petty has become more successful than the sum of his influences, which is quite an accomplishment. This surpsisingly rocking freshman Warner effort conclusively quells 'Petty's best work is behind him' rumors. Still wise enough to pair with the stinging guitar work of Mike Campbell, Petty garnered MTV airplay with such radio-friendly tunes as &quot;You Don't Know How if Feels,&quot; and the top-notch rocker, &quot;You Wreck Me.&quot; This is good news for his huge following, who can now look forward to an impressive catalog of tunes during the duration of his Warner contract.
B00005QIPH|4.0|An actual reviewers quote, &quot;bottom line: they are all rich &amp; the lead singer's father owns elite modeling agency. <br />'Daddy, can I have a band for my birthday?'&quot;<br />The truth is guitars, pianos and drums cost money.  I don't know many bands that came from truly destitute conditions.  Trying to tell us a band isn't pure enough because they didn't come from the conditions you *want* them to come from is ludicrous.  Some will tell you that anything in the realm of pop culture isn't true culture, or that the only true art is created on an 'underground' scene, devoid of the influence of money.  These people are dying to be hip. <br />The truth is while many people spout about what true art is, some are busy creating it.  Money is the enabler that empowers great art.<br />Oh, and by the way I enjoy the album.
6302759110|3.0|God knows why this movie wasn't titled simply 'Dracula' - maybe to sound more high-minded? Francis Ford Coppola's 'Bram Stoker's Dracula'? Hardly. It's fit to break your tongue to pronounce this. Maybe to emphasize the literary origin? With all the sex and animal-attraction references involving blood-shot eyes, Dracula's long-lost love Mina (Winona Ryder) looking over her shoulder apprehensively, and an escaped woolf wandering the streets of Victorian London as casually and imperceptibly as any ol' stray dog? Not (...) likely! <br />Gary Oldman does not exactly sprng to mind as the best choice to play the Divine Count. His bloodsucker is more brooding than outright villainous, but what with all the buxom ladies constantly getting out of their corsets and the young hunks on hand to chew and spit out, he fits in nicely into the proceedings. This version of the story is closer to the Hammer Film tradition of vampire erotica than to the austere original. Not that this is necessarily a bad thing - the costumes, sets and visuals are more than satisfying, but it's the acting that squeeks like rusty hinges on a coffin-lid. <br />Oldman is just the beginning of a string of weird casting - Winona Ryder is more petulant than haunted, wearing a perpetual confused pout, and when she tries to play the passionate lady she comes off as a (...) schoolgirl. Anthony Hopkins is OK, if a bit too jocular as the determined Dr. Van Helsing, the guy who used to kill vampires long before Buffy was even conceived, Richard E. Grant is appropriately hysterical as a well-meaning junky twit, and Sadie Frost does little more than flash her pretty red curls around... Actually, I was wrong, she does do something quite out of the ordinary - she gets to have sex with Yeti's nephew, Gary Gorilla. Don't ask for an explanation, the purpose of this particular scene escaped me - maybe the producers were aiming at a universal audience, zoophiles and all. Tom Waits is unrecognizable (and chillingly touching)as Dracula's plaything, Renfield. And Keanu Reeves attains new heights of looking as though he had just swallowed a flagpole playing Mina's husband-to-be. No wonder sucking blood looked like a more inviting alternative to the poor maiden. <br />I love vampire lore - stories, movies, legends, you name it. Which is why I have gone so easy on Francis Ford Coppola's 'Bram Stoker's Dracula'. Otherwise, no fancy dressings or false fangs in the world would save this uneasy blend of Victorian mores and Anne Rice-style morals from a swift and final demise.
0380002930|5.0|I first read this book in elementary school and remembered it being simply fantastic. As I have re-read it over the years, I now understand why. The characters are incredibly real and the story is engrossing with it's unique look at animal life. The author does an excellent job of creating a realistic rabbit portrait (their habbits,language etc.) while managing to keep the rabbit characters incredibly human. Hazel, Fiver, Blackberry and company are as impossible to forget as any human being creation. Fantastic!
0385505833|4.0|John Grisham's Skipping Christmas is not a very original Christmas tale; it mixes and blends the best elements of The Grinch Who Stole Christmas and A Christmas Carol together to offer us a modern-day tale about the joys and meaning of Christmas. Sure, the book is at time a bit repetitive and it feels a little recycled, but it's good harmless fun nonetheless.<br />Luther Krank has decided to skip Christmas this year. There will be no celebrating, no tree, no presents, no fruit cakes, no decorations. Instead, he will save the money he usually spends of such things and go on a cruise with his wife. And why? Because he feels a little depressed since his only daughter is gone to Peru on a Corps mission and will not be back for Christmas.<br />Of course, the people around the Krank house feel a little irritated that Krank would refuse to participate in the celebrations. But of course, they will all come together in the end because this is Christmas, a time of giving and a time of loving.<br />The book is very short and often funny. I found myself smiling more than once. This will not become a Christmas classic like A Christmas Carol or The Christmas Box, but it is still a fun read that I will want to come back to every year as Christmas comes closer and closer. Had the book been longer, than I might not have felt the same way. But coming in at a trim 177 pages, the story is a very quick and very entertaining read. A book that will surely put you in the Christmas spirit!
B00005RFQ5|4.0|This is Prince's jazz album.  Filled with jazz-funk extended jams all over the place, this really shows how good of a musician Prince is (and John Blackwell, on drums...WOW).  I'm not a big fan of artists cluttering their music with religion, but the music overshadows everything else.  Anyone interested in jazz-funk fusion or just wishing Prince would put something out worth buying, should get this.  The most live, jazzy, and organic sound Prince has ever produced.  The spoken word thing gets a bit old, but I've just been fast-forwarding to the songs.  This album is in the style of Eryka Badu's last album, D'Angelo and in some places, vintage Santana.  I never thought I'd ever say this again, but...I recommend this Prince cd.
0345448898|5.0|I recommend to anyone considering this purchase that they check out the huge collection of user reviews for the individual books in the series (i.e. The Golden Compass, etc.)  You'll get a good idea of reader sentiment from those.  In fact, there's little I can write here that hasn't already been covered, but I'll chime in and say that I enjoyed these books immensely.  The plot is gripping, the story rich in detail, the characters complex and engaging.  Readers who are concerned with Pullman's treatment of religion should be mindful of the distinction between belief, spirituality and faith on the one hand, and the political machinations of religious institutions on the other.  I think Pullman's criticism is focused on the latter and well-justified.<br />  I just bought this boxed set as a gift for my brother on his 13th birthday (I'm an adult), and I'm sure his experience in reading it will be different from mine.  But I expect he'll enjoy it equally.
B00004Y7SF|5.0|This CD (I thought) was very very good. I absouluty LOVE Christmas and everything that comes with it. I love listening to Christmas music and I have to say that this cd was one of the best. <br />Christina has a great voice and you can tell she is very putting her heart and soul into her music. She relaly gets into her music and that makes the listener get into it as well.
B00004Z4WR|5.0|Like I always say, just enjoy the movie and stop worrying about the flaws. When you do that, this movie is a blast. A great movie. Enjoy.
B00005RFQ5|1.0|I am a Premium member in The NPG Club, so I was able to get this release a little early. I have everthing and anything he has ever done, and I play his music more than anything else.<br />The music itself is just a big miss, the lyrics deal mostly with Black oppression/slavery, which is fine, although at times in a controversial way. It's just poured on a little too thick for me though.<br />Don't look to dance, or pump the volume much up on anything on this release. Having played it twice, almost three times. I can't bring myself to put it in the  cd deck again, so I pulled it out......it is just that bad! <br />Musically it starts out sounding like a sound check, or just some boring open jam not really beginning and going nowhere. The CD doesn't begin to take off until just past the half way mark. The message is blurred, late, and as another reviewer put it....just plain &quot;dumb&quot;.<br />I for one would love to see &quot;his royal badness&quot; do well with any of his releases. As I can see here others have went well out of there way to make extra long praising posts. I love Prince, but I gotta be honest. I also love jazz, R&amp;B, and love soul, but this CD is not a movin' grovin' jazzy success. It is a miss no matter how much WE all wanted it to hit. <br />The singles he puts out monthly at the NPG Club are far more superior than any of these cuts. I am so shocked at the difference in quality and in lyrics. If you have not heard Prince lately get the songs at his club.<br />Sorry P
B00004Z4WR|5.0|Like I always say, just enjoy the movie and stop worrying about the flaws. When you do that, this movie is a blast. A great movie. Enjoy.
B00005QK3W|5.0|What an outstanding album!  If you are a music lover, then this album must be in your collection.
B00005LOUP|5.0|Come on people, this is The Grinch. You cannot critique The Grinch. This is my favorite movie. It sends the same message that the cartoon did. It's THE GRINCH! It's the way it should be. Don't bother with your Hollywood crud, this is Dr. Suess and it is a joyous movie for the holiday season. God Bless, and Happy Holidays.
B00005RYQO|5.0|This movie is so cool i recommend it to everyone i saw it in theaters 5 times it is worth whatever price you have to pay, I love the combonation of sweet cars and hot women, and the semi gang wars going on in between. BUY THIS MOVIE!
B00005NGSE|5.0|Recorded in 1978 with their classic early lineup this Album is one of the all time great live albums. Ulrich Roth's guitar playing is a high point throughout this CD. The mix is excellent and it contains many standout tracks like All Night Long, Polar Nights, We'll Burn the Sky and He's a Woman - She's a Man (which even has Rudolf Schenker laying down some lead guitar). The influence of the Schenker brothers, Rudolf and Michael (of UFO), on heavy metal cannot be overstated.<BR>   Yngwie Malmsteen might tell you he owes it all to Bach, but there's little doubt he slowed this LP down to 16rpms and studied Uli Roth note for note. Roth's guitar playing is unbelievable!! The band is tight, Klaus Meine's voice excellent, as always, and the feel of the show is great. A great band at a great stage in their early career and a mind-blowing performance. Also check out Mahogany Rush Live 78, UFO Strangers in the Night, and Thin Lizzy Live and Dangerous for other contenders from this era of great live metal albums.
B00005R5G9|5.0|Yes, I am openly and willingly admitting to watching and liking this movie!! Okay so what if it's just a silly comedy and an 80's one at that?? It's fun, entertaining, and a lot of laughs. And Estelle Getty is in it!! Hello?! Sophia Petrillo?! Golden Girls anyone? It's everything a comedy should be, simple, funny, and entertaining for a bit.
B00004W52U|5.0|The great thing about this album is that it has most of the songs off of Operation Ivy's other albums. That is not to say that the other albums aren't worth buying, but this album is just very convenient. I STRONGLY recommend it to everyone. And I'm not just saying this because they are my favorite band. Operation Ivy plays real quality music.
B000021Y77|5.0|This movie left me on the edge of my seat and short of breath. Once just wasn't enough in the theater. I just had to see it again on the big screen. I never used to be into movies with subtitles. But the effect just isn't the same as it is in its native tongue. Just when I thought it's over, it just takes you on another turn and another and another!!! If you like fast paced, unpredictable action with a soundtrack that fits its movie like a glove, this one's for you.
0452282152|3.0|I picked up this book on request from my godmother, and read it over two or three days. Although not bad, it's not extremely memorable either.<br />This book imagines the story of the anonymous Girl With A Pearl Earring in Vermeer's famous painting of the same name. In the book, the girl is Griet, a newly hired maid in Vermeer's household. Griet is a well-drawn, sympathetic character whose emotions are clearly defined. Her struggles between Vermeer and Pieter, the butcher's son, as well as her more subsumed longing for a better and higher life, are easy to relate to. However, this book does not delve into the many layers of human emotion within Vermeer. Although probably written in partial to demonstrate his enigmatical existence, it is a bit of a letdown.<br />Overall, this is a nice, simple book that does not require you to think; it merely requires you to lose yourself in 17th-century Holland for a few days.
B00005R2BG|5.0|Outrageous, extravagant, over the top, and totally brilliant. What more could you want from a Baz Luhrmann musical extravaganza. If you loved Strictly Ballroom, you'll love this.<br />Apart from 2 movies (Dead Calm and Bangkok Hilton) I haven't really been a particular fan of Nicole Kidman's. That all changed after I saw Moulin Rouge. She was just brilliant. What an actress, what a voice and not at all what I expected. Excellent choices of songs for her to sing - I'll Fly Away, Sparkling Diamonds and the Elephant Medley. How could the critics say she was cold and inanimate - she simply sparkled in the movie. I couldn't imagine anyone else playing the part of Satine - it just wouldn't have been the same.<br />One of my favourites scenes was when Satine and Christian were first in her room and she was trying to seduce him, and then a wee bit later when everyone was trying to persuade the Duke to invest in the play. She was such a laugh. <br />Well done to Ewan McGregor also. I have always been a fan of his - loved him in Shallow Grave. Ewan also has a fantastic voice and you can understand why Elton John agreed to let him sing Your Song (a particular favourite of mine). He does an excellent job.<br />The chemistry between Ewan and Nicole was brilliant to watch - they just sizzled. They also sang well together - The Elephant Medley and Come What May showed that their voices were in perfect harmony.<br />I don't think that I will ever be able to hear Like A Virgin again without remembering Moulin Rouge. I already have the soundtrack and I can't wait to buy the video so that I can watch it all over again.
B000002G23|5.0|This box set is truly a must-have: it has every track from all 5 Police studio albums, plus a collection of b-sides, live tracks and rarities.  I can finally toss my worn-out 45 singles, which had such b-side gems like &quot;Shamble,&quot; the jazzy &quot;Flexible Strategies&quot; and &quot;Someone to Talk to&quot; which features Andy Summers on vocals.  Thanks to this collection, I can now hear these rarities in a remastered sound that's fuller and richer than the vinyl editions ever were.  Plus, there's a booklet which nicely summarizes the Police's discography.  So my advice is simple: get it.  Even if you own all of their studio work, it's still worth the investment to buy this package, which has every song in one collection.
B00005R2BG|5.0|Outrageous, extravagant, over the top, and totally brilliant. What more could you want from a Baz Luhrmann musical extravaganza. If you loved Strictly Ballroom, you'll love this.<br />Apart from 2 movies (Dead Calm and Bangkok Hilton) I haven't really been a particular fan of Nicole Kidman's. That all changed after I saw Moulin Rouge. She was just brilliant. What an actress, what a voice and not at all what I expected. Excellent choices of songs for her to sing - I'll Fly Away, Sparkling Diamonds and the Elephant Medley. How could the critics say she was cold and inanimate - she simply sparkled in the movie. I couldn't imagine anyone else playing the part of Satine - it just wouldn't have been the same.<br />One of my favourites scenes was when Satine and Christian were first in her room and she was trying to seduce him, and then a wee bit later when everyone was trying to persuade the Duke to invest in the play. She was such a laugh. <br />Well done to Ewan McGregor also. I have always been a fan of his - loved him in Shallow Grave. Ewan also has a fantastic voice and you can understand why Elton John agreed to let him sing Your Song (a particular favourite of mine). He does an excellent job.<br />The chemistry between Ewan and Nicole was brilliant to watch - they just sizzled. They also sang well together - The Elephant Medley and Come What May showed that their voices were in perfect harmony.<br />I don't think that I will ever be able to hear Like A Virgin again without remembering Moulin Rouge. I already have the soundtrack and I can't wait to buy the video so that I can watch it all over again.
B00003CXSP|4.0|&quot;Hannibal&quot; was a solid hit upon its release in February 2001, but, like the &quot;Godfather III,&quot; it stood in the shadow of its more superior predecessor. When word got out that &quot;Hannibal&quot; was going to be filmed, expectations were high, and critics gave the movie no love, often comparing it unfairly to the far better &quot;The Silence of the Lambs.&quot; But &quot;Hannibal,&quot; as a film by itself, is a decent picture, and should be watched with an open mind, flaws and all. Julianne Moore gave a great performance as Clarice Starling, although Anthony Hopkins verged on camp during his revisited role as Hannibal Lecter. Some of the scenes were so outrageously graphic, it was often hard to take them seriously and realize the full horror of Lecter's actions. But for all its shortcomings, &quot;Hannibal&quot; the DVD is a worthy purchase because MGM gave this disc such a deluxe treatment. The picture and sound are top-notch, while the features on the second disc inlcude multiple angle shots, documentaries, and other goodies. So my advice is this: if you hated &quot;Hannibal,&quot; then you're not going to find much to like here. But those who, like myself, found the film flawed but still entertaining should grab this DVD: it's among the best MGM has ever produced. It's clear that the studio put a lot a love into its making.
B00005MAM2|5.0|At last a re-vamped version of Katsushiro Otomo´s Fantastic Movie. With all the movie re-mastered. This is the best version of the movie I´ve ever seen. All the visual noise has been wiped clean and the sound is perfect.<br />This Is a much awaited sci-fi release and it is up to the expectations I had.
B00005RIKD|4.0|Having spent 6 years of my life  in special operations, I was greatly moved by &quot;Fragile&quot; when it was originally released in 1987.  It begins to capture the awe and sadness that can only be experienced after  you look at a room full of bodies where, seconds before, there had been living, breathing human beings. This new recording perfectly captures the somber tones of 9/11, and the moment of silence following it - much longer on the video version - speaks volumes about the innocence lost by all Americans on that day.<br />     That said, most of this CD could have used  more of the high energy that fills &quot;If Ever I Lose My Faith In You&quot; and &quot;Every Breath You Take.&quot;   The acoustic sound worked well 20 years ago on &quot;The Secret Policeman's Other Ball&quot; (He covered &quot;Roxanne&quot; &amp; &quot;Message In A Bottle,&quot; a heartbreaking  release long out of print from 1981) because both the songs and the experience of seeing Sting perform solo were new. These new versions of &quot;Roxanne&quot; and &quot;Don't Stand So Close To Me&quot; sound discouraged and world-weary - the last thing we need right now.<br />    The musicans here are all supremely gifted, as are the number of jazz notables who appear in cameos, but Sting has always been best at straight-forward pop music.  My favorite song on the CD, however is the ballad, &quot;When We Dance.&quot; It reminds me that love CAN conquer all, and that striving to make  sense of our personal relationships becomes more important than ever as our geo-political realities recede into potential chaos. This CD, more than the 148-hour-a-day news coverage or any telethon-a-thon for rescue workers, is an accurate and moving record of what happened to all of us on a single - and hopefully atypical - day in the life  of the American people.
B00002MZ2C|4.0|Like it or not Zach De La Rocha is gone from Rage Against The Machine, but in this (the final Rage album of they're own material) they shine as ever.<BR>Perhaps the messages portrayed in this album are similar to those in Rage's previous two, the emotion and the killer riffs are still there.<br />This album can't really be compared to the bands 1991 self titled debut as it greatly differs in terms of song construction.<BR>The tracks on this album are (mostly) shorter than those on the 1991 classic, and as a result lack variety on occasion.<BR>Asside from a little more repetition the songs themselves all stand out, with never a repeated lyric or a doubled riff.<BR>If you paid no attention to the lyrics you may even think that Rage had gone commercial on songs such as 'Guerilla Radio' where the repetition reaches a predictable extreme.<br />But with all that said this is Rage Against the Machine, you should know by now that if you are going to purchase this (or any other rage album) that you are not going to get 50 mins worth of love songs.<BR>The political views on display here are as strong as ever and Tom Morello remains true to form on what in conclusion is a fantastic album, in a slightly different fashion to other Rage albums.
B00005AFVR|4.0|From the pounding drums that open &quot;My Love Will Not You Down&quot; to the blistering guitar solo that ignites &quot;Youngstown,&quot; this release ably demonstrates that that this tour - and band - are still miles away from becoming the newest nostalgia act. With that said, is this the best set list these guys could come up with? &quot;Why include a 14-minute version of &quot;10th Avenue Freeze-Out,&quot; complete with band intros? Or the extremely lackluster take on &quot;Don't Look Back,&quot; a marginal Darkness outtake ? For every &quot;Murder Incorporated&quot; (Another stand-out performance by Max Weinberg!) there is the sitar-drawling version of &quot;Born In The USA&quot;! Ugh! On any given night, Springsteen and his band can make their audience believe that they ARE the greatest rock &amp; roll band that ever existed - why not take the time to gather the best performances of the best songs? I still love this CD - the purest, most exciting rock release of the year despite its flaws - but it could have been so much more. Here's hoping that there will be a next time to get it right!
B00004XONN|2.0|From the fan favourite 'Bends' to the incredible 1997 album 'Ok Computer' it would have been safe to say that Radiohead were establishing themselves as not only great rock musicians but up and coming legends.<br />With 'Ok Computers' good overseas reception Radiohead had the world at their feet, and for them it was just a matter of producing a sub par rock album and relying on the fan base, or making the progressive effort to increase that fan base.<br />Radiohead chose to &quot;diversify&quot;, replacing edibly good riffs with barely digestable synthesized sounds.<BR>Kid A is average at best, and is mostly failed at Radioheads inability to decide which mood the album is focussed in, tracks such as 'Optimistic' are true to form throughout but the rest of the album is a step back in quality from past recordings (Namely Ok Computer).<br />Instead of answering the question of the mass media, Radiohead decided to ignore it completely and change direction (musically) this may be appreciated by some, but those in search of quality rock music should look elsewhere.<br />One has to hope that for Radioheads future efforts they put away the beat box's and synthesizers, and pick up where they left off at the end of 1997.
B00001NFL2|5.0|I always want to listen to the whole CD, start to finish.  Great classic rock with great lyrics.  A &quot;must have&quot; in everyone's music collection!
B00005RFAI|5.0|This CD totally ROCKS! I have been listening to it over and over again. People need to recognize the outstanding talent Pink has...the CD blew me away.You can tell her heart is truly in this music. I'm really feeling it. There just arent the right words to desribe it. Shes gotta twist of Alicia Keys, with some Fiona Apple and a bit of Eminems attitude. Straight up raw emotion. Sure beats the crap outta Britney...<BR>All I gotta say is, PINK YOU GO GIRL!!!!!!!!
6300183211|5.0|I loved this movie. When i rented it I had doubts but when i saw it... my mouth was wide open in shock of how wrong i was. I recommend this movie for 13+years-old. I noticed every scene added up and the plot is something you could sink your teeth into. So if your a movie fan (especially mob movies) i HIGHLY recommend this movie of power and coke.
B00001OH7V|5.0|&quot;Heroes&quot;, is an irresistable song about two lovers, one on either side of the Berlin wall,  and is one of the most beautiful and strange singles ever recorded. The song describes a divided world and also the divided self of the artist.  &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot; is about both the attraction of opposites and about how we all combine opposing qualities within ourselves.  &quot;V-2 Schnieder&quot; is perhaps the most listenable song after  &quot;Heroes&quot;, V-2 suggests the WW11 German V-2 rocket but is actually an homage to a German musician.<br />The three intrumental numbers &quot;Sense of Doubt&quot;, &quot;Moss garden&quot;, and &quot;Neukoln&quot; may or may not appeal to you. And other than the very friendly &quot;Heroes&quot; and soothing &quot;V-2 Schnieder&quot; the songs on this disc are not immediately attractive to the ear, they are however songs that make their appeal felt after getting to know them.<br />Low, Heroes, and Lodger are the three discs refered to as Bowies Berlin period.Low is by far the darkest of the three as its songs are about Bowies &quot;psychotic withdrawl&quot; from the world and is perhaps the most respected of the three. Heroes shows a Bowie who is coming out of his self imposes exile and putting his life into some kind of order using the divided city of Berlin as a symbol of his own personal divided condition. Not your typical pop or rock terrain. These discs are for your more thoughtful, artistic and moody days.Low and Heroes are unique discs and will reward listeners who give them a chance. Highly unique and groundbreaking music by a highly unique combination of talents(Bowie, Eno). Many respect Bowie for these discs who didn't care for the earlier rock star Bowie.<br />Christiane F. is an excellent collection of Station to Station  and Berlin period material. It includes three Station to Station tracks, three excellent tracks off of Heroes: &quot;Heroes&quot;(a slightly different version with some German lyrics), &quot;V-2 Schnieder&quot; and the instrumental&quot;Sense of Doubt&quot;. Along with an instrumental from Low and the two hits from Lodger, &quot;Boys Keep Swinging&quot;, &quot;Look Back in Anger&quot;.&quot;V-2 Schnieder&quot; and the instrumental&quot;Sense of Doubt&quot;. Along with an instrumental from Low and the two hits from Lodger, &quot;Boys Keep Swinging&quot;, &quot;Look Back in Anger&quot;.
0767827694|3.0|This is one really odd movie, I've never seen anything quite like it. I found the story interesting but strange at the same time. I'm not sure how historically accurate it is but the movie seems very well researched and loaded with tiny details that could so easily have been over looked or even left out, much better done than so many modern day setting movies. The plot mostly made sense to me although the passage of time seems dreamlike in later stages. I really liked the locations and costumes, weird as they were I think the clothing was probably exactly right for the times, remarkable achievement for what I think was actually a low budget movie.
B000005JHS|4.0|This album was released in the fall of 1986. People were wondering if the band would ever record again after there hiatus and Arcadia/Power Station projects in 1985. They lost two members and went from teen idols to semi-adult contemporary music makers with Notorious. Notorious is jazzy, funky, and soulfull. They got a horn section. Nile Rogers produced. And Warren was pulled in to replace Andy Taylor on some tracks like &quot;Vertigo&quot;. The songs are largely about romance (like Arcadia's) and less corny (like Seven and the Ragged Tiger's). Yes, here is where the boys become men. Arcadia's influence trickles into Notorious on tracks like &quot;Winter Marches On&quot; and &quot;So Misled.&quot; &quot;Skin Trade&quot; and &quot;American Science&quot; and &quot;Meet El Presidente&quot; show that the band can still be a bit absurd, but forgiveably so. Duran Duran wouldn't be right if they weren't a little ridiculous.
B000002UAU|5.0|Music was regarded as a form of art as soon as  this groundbreaking album was released, and for good reason too. After the success and acclaim of their first experimental album, Revolver, it was expected that something else would come along, that would be equally - if not more- accomplished. And we were most definitely not let down. Sgt Peppers Lonely Hearts Club Band is probably the most well known and most recognised Beatles album. In the first track, Sgt Peppers Lonely Hearts Club Band, The Beatles promise us a good show, and we aren't at all disappointed, all the tracks are crafted with sheer excellence and expertise, thanks to the lads and of course, producer George Martin and engineer Geoff Emerick, among others. My personal favourites are the psychedelic &quot;Lucy In The Sky With Diamonds&quot;, the creative &quot;Fixing A Hole&quot;, the circus-like &quot;Being For The Benefit of Mr Kite&quot;. Other popular favourites include McCartney's &quot;When I'm Sixty Four&quot;, &quot;She's Leaving Home&quot; and &quot;Getting Better&quot;. But the real masterpiece on this spectacular work of art is &quot; A Day In The Life&quot;.  A 40 piece orchestra was used for this 5.33 track, which concludes with a 40 second piano chord then a whistle only audible to dogs, then finally a few seconds of mumbo-jumbo, known as &quot;The Inner Groove&quot;.   This is a must have for the discerning fab four fan.
B0000242RU|4.0|First off the cover is an eye sore. Duran Duran were listening to house music supposedly and they made this album. Duran had moderate success in 1987 with Notorious but were clearly blown out of the water by both INXS and U2 who had released &quot;Kick&quot; and &quot;The Joshua Tree&quot; respectively. Suddenly here was &quot;BIG THING&quot; which seemed graphically and musically to borrow from the INXS book of aesthetics. Simon Le Bon even had a permed mop. This is not to say they were ripping off INXS, just influenced or impressioned by them. Musically the album is the last really good one they would make for years. &quot;Do you believe in Shame&quot;, &quot;I dont want your love&quot; and &quot;What she said (why she stayed?)&quot; are the doozies on here. Forgive the album cover and it's a decent album.
B00004ZAV3|5.0|This album is a great starter for the new Beatle fan...if you aren't very familiar with the Beatles music, this album is a great place to start because it consists of all their number one hits in the UK and USA. Listening  to the songs in chronological order is vital...it's like an audio timeline of the Beatles together, as musicians, producing music that changed society and musical history as we know it. From the cheerful harmonica in &quot;Love Me Do&quot; to the elaborate &quot;Long and Winding Road&quot;, 1 is a worthy tribute to those four Liverpool lads who changed our lives. Stand out tracks? All of them, they all went to number one after all. To be fair to Harrison, &quot; Something&quot; was included...at the expense of Lennon's reminiscent &quot;Strawberry Fields Forever&quot; or &quot;Please Please Me&quot;. All of the 27 songs are fantastically remastered, even &quot;Love Me Do&quot;, although that is in mono, as a stereo version was never recorded. For new Beatles fans and old alike, this album is a crucial purchase if you wish to discover the Beatles or add to your personal Beatles collection. And if you are not one already, you will definitely become a Fab Four Fanatic after listening to this album.
B00004ZAV3|1.0|The Beatles are one of my favorite bands in the world, but since I don't own all of their albums, I bought this CD.  It is terrible.  The songs are thrown in a horrible order, and I can't stand to listen to the whole thing though.  Each individual song is excellent, but their ordering screws the whole thing up.  Just buy one of their CDs, not this.
B00005Q66T|5.0|She's the girl! Take a Bow!
B00005RFAI|5.0|Pink has really hit the nail on the head with this album. After recent events I think people are looking for music that actuyally speaks to them and not music that will be like a sugar pill with limited effects. On Missundaztood Pink gets heavily into writing the songs. She wrote 11 of the 14 songs on the album. The tracks actually mean something and the melodies and musical arrangements are breathtaking. Songs like My Vietnam, Lonely Girl, and Family Portrait really get to you and leave you breathless. She keeps her sense of humour and ads little speaking bits in the beginning of certain songs that will keep you smiling. I bought this CD on the day it first came out and have been listening to it non-stop all day everyday. I especially love her new rock driven song. But don't get her wrong she's not about to become all indie, there's still some R&amp;B on this album. It's a perfect fusion that everyone will enjoy. And what someone else on here said is true, you can't put this album in one genre. It's definatly the best album I've heard from any of those artists that came out during the Britney era. While Britney is whining and pretending to be deep, Pink is not pretending to be deep, she's just honest.
B000002UVX|5.0|One of the best. It blew my mind when I first heard it and it still gets me going when I listen to Power To Love and Changes. Recorded live at the Filmore 69/70 New Years Eve. Actually, there were two shows each night Dec 31 and Jan 1. To hear the other shows and versions of the concert get \\"Live at the Filmore\\". The versions of Machine Gun, Who Know will show Jimi's improv with Billy Cox & Buddy Miles This is essnetial listening for anyone new to Jimi.
076790382X|4.0|Personally, I found Bryson's books &quot;A Walk in the Woods&quot;, and &quot;In a Sunburned Country&quot; better.  One of the enjoyable things about Bryson's travel books is that it is so easy to disagree with him.<br />What I mean by that is most travel writers are wishy-washy and state things in a neutral, innocuous and boring way.  You can always tell what Bryson thinks, and agree or disagree, I like it that way.  If you want a vague account of natural beauty or accounts stating some boring museum is &quot;educational&quot;, this book is not for you.<br />In this book specifically, you get to hear some of Bryson's thoughts on politics and culture in general.  He has absorbed a little too much liberal, socialism, but I still enjoy his fine eye for detail.<br />Overall, not his best, but still enjoyable.
B000002P72|5.0|One of the best of B. B. King recorded live at thr Regal in 1964. Lucille (his guitar) is at an all time high. All you need to do is compare this recording to later ones to hear the difference of crystal crear blues riffs. Live at San Quentin is another classic but to hear the roots of the King this is a must for the collection.
B00005QIPH|1.0|I cannot believe how people are falling over themselves to praise this lame band. After hearing all the comparisons to such greats as the Velvet Underground, the Stooges and Television I was practically salivating to hear the Strokes. Then I had the misfortune of actually buying and listening to them. I can deal with bands that are derivative of their idols but this piece of crap is derivative and BORING. Please don't buy into the hype and waste your money. This is most definitely not &quot;it&quot; although there is a rhyming word that is more appropriate.
0671027344|5.0|an absolutely heartwrenching story.  i read it straight through (laughing and sobbing the entire time) and immediately passed it on to my best friend who did the same.<br />ive since bought half a dozen copies (passing them along to friends and family) and tell everyone i come across that they should &quot;READ THIS BOOK&quot;.<br />really.  you should.
B00005MG2Y|4.0|Linkin Park's Hybrid Theory is one of the greatest albums I have ever heard.  I think that putting High Voltage and My December on Hybrid Theory and adding 20 dollars, is not a waste of money,(especially if you have the original album, you should) but I think your money could be better spent.  I have attended a concert of theirs and seen exactly what they're capable of.  Not only have I heard Hybrid Theory about a thousand times, I have searched for other songs of theirs.  When I saw they released Hybrid Theory with two bonus tracks, I was a little amazed.  High Voltage and My December are great songs, but the greatest was left out.  &quot;And One,&quot; a song that they played at the concert I attended, is a GREAT song by them; I believe this song should have been on the original album.  The band played this song when they were called Hybrid Theory, not yet Linkin Park.   I believe that other songs like Part of Me, Step Up, High Voltage, My December, Carousel, and And One, should be all on a seperate import.  Since this hasn't been released yet, these songs can be found and downloaded.  I suggest that if you're a TRUE Linkin Park fan, you should track down these songs.  If you're someone who just likes the song Crawling and wants the cd, these two bonus tracks won't do much for you!  I would give a 5+ for the original Hybrid Theory album, and their other unreleased songs, but for the two bonus tracks for 20 more dollars, I will give an overall rating of 4.
B00004YRQA|5.0|Sony has proven in the past several years that their memory cards are the most compatible with the system.  You can take your risk with another company's memory card that supposedly has 8x's memory that is impossible to work and if you find out how it works it will erase your saved games every month.  Just stick with the Sony brand memory card.  I have around 8 different game's info saved on the one that I bought.  Even if you have to pick up 2 of them, it's a better deal then the generic memory cards or some fancy looking piece of junk.<br />                                    Jon with no H
1563896656|4.0|First off, I am not generally a comic-book reader so my reaction and comments may be very different from the norm.  That being said, I really enjoyed _The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen_, a fantastic steampunk view of late 19th century London.<br />The premise of the comic is that a shadowy British government figure gathers together adventurers (The Invisible Man, Dr. Jekyll/Mr. Hyde, Captain Nemo, Allan Quatermain, &amp; Mina from _Dracula_) to do secretive work.  The premise is a little rocky.  Why gather these 'heros' when you could use British military?  But it's all in fun.<br />The stories are compelling, the drawings are excellent, and the characters are fascinating.  I really enjoyed the design of Nemo's Nautilus, and the gigantic statues situated throughout London.  The tongue-in-cheek introductions by the authors are hilarious.  On the whole this is a fabulous comic book collection.  With the exception of one or two scenes (a sexually voracious headmistress at a boarding school, and a semi-graphic rape scene) I can whole-heartedly recommend this collection to anyone.
0671578855|5.0|I absolutely love this book, but I don't recommend that anyone reads this as their first novel in the Vorkosigan series (at least read Komarr first).  <BR>There's a lot going on in this book, but I would rather not ruin it for anyone.  However, if nothing else, Mile's dinner party is worth the price of the book.
B00005QK3W|5.0|Most of the GREAT Reviews are right on target! Hey thanks for the space to give my review, First a quick opinion I'm 48 yrs old and don't usually do reviews. I love the beatles and followed and enjoyed their music all through my life. I love,hendrix,the Who,Led Zep,Clapton, Elton, Bowie, U2. So what do you care. My point is I am sick and tired of people trashing Mccartney. Look at the list above the greatest of the great and they have not been close to perfect. The Who made an entire carear on 4 solid albums, Led Zep the same,Clapton what can you say about how great is he? He had many a dry spell,does more cover songs than original material but no one says that,and Reptile and the tour he seemed outdated and tired. Even U2 fell of the wagon, remember the devil ears and red lips tour with the giant lemon and,if you want to talk solo look at Mick an Keith of the Stones, combined they have not had an even mildly sucessful single solo effort and boy can Richards carry a tune, when was the last time someone mentioned that?. But they are still all considered GREAT All these people are great but!! Not a one can match Mac career and thats a fact. So what gives with Mac never catching a break by some. This guy is many time more sucessful than all of the above and some combined. He was 50% of the Greatest most innovative band in the world ever.I loved all the Beatles but hey Lennon never wrote with any one better thn Mac or wanted to in his own words and neither did Mac. Lets face it only became fashionable to crack on Mac when John and the Other Beatles did it when they were all (angry) at each other after the beatles broke up. And guy's lennon had the most respect for mac and vice versa than anyone and they were over most of the bull in the books two years after the break up.  Ask George Martin about who did what in the Beatles? Never mind the tabliod (...) these guys are like brothers and were there own worst critics.They critizing each other is one thing. Imagine Keith Richards taking a shot at Mccartneys solo efforts?? Come on now.I read some here say you can here the age in his voice. Fair enough I defy anyone to see any difference in Keith or Mick how would you tell?  Now to the album Driving Rain. Driving Rain reminds me of the days of running to the record store,going home and putting the new beatles record on to see where they were now and were going and having that never ending feeling of hearing fresh innovative music, at it'sworse extremely interesting and at it's best simple the greatest music made this century. This album is fresh,high spirited and slam bang sold rock. Paul sounds great and the songs are flat out played !! His bass reminds us who have been around a while before you new kids why Mac was always considered to be amoung the top bass players. The tracks are full of feeling, emotion and jump off the disc. As you play through this album again and agin it's hard to believe it's that good at this stage in his life. Their are interesting musical twists and turns throughout each song and very little straight 3 minute pleasently moving along songs.  Something Mac gets rapped with. Seems a bit damed if you do Dammed if you don't going on! Some flat out rock like \\"About you\\" and \\"Rinse the raindrops\\", \\"Magic\\" is vintage Mac and can bring tears if you have followed he and linda these years. This disc should have \\"grammy\\"written all over it. Even Dylan now that he is co herient again got away with one of those a year or two ago. Hey, if you dont like Paul thats fair we all have our likes and dislikes. I am simply saying as someone who loves all sorts of music and has followed a man who has written an overwhelming amout of great music and help change the music world deserves a break now and again from the old bull shots with the mindless trashing that some time comes around about him. These tracks could have been on The white album / Abbey road etc and they would be thought of as classic's. At sixty years old to be this revelant is probally cause for jealosy by many, maybe that's why the guy gets such a hard time some time. Get this album if you love great music that makes you feel special. I rather listen to paul at his worst than the manufactured Boy bands or or Jackson and his 1980 dance steps revisited. If these people can continually be considered great that Mac is a GOD!Brittney????????????????????????? Great job Paul to an old warrior who can still shame the twentysomethings!!!!!!!
0688062334|5.0|I first read this book in sixth grade, years ago, and I have loved it ever since. For anyone looking for a synopsis/summary, it is about the eldest of three sisters, Sophie, living in a land called Ingary. Sophie thinks that her life will be boring and predictable, but the introduction of a castle, a temperamental wizard named Howl, a fire-demon named Calcifer, and the Witch of the Waste ensure the opposite. Sophie becomes directly entangled in the whole business by a curse put on her by the Witch of the Waste. <br />I think that I have given away too much already, so I'll only say now that Jones does a fine job of pulling together an intricately and beautifully woven plot. If you read it, you will enjoy it, and I recommend Castle in the Air (title correct?)afterward if you want to see a little more of Sophie and Howl, though Howl's Moving Castle was the better of the two. If you like fantasy with a twist, you'll like this book.

As you play through this album again and agin it's hard to believe it's that good at this stage in his life. Their are interesting musical twists and turns throughout each song and very little straight 3 minute pleasently moving along songs. (...)Some flat out rock like \\"About you\\" and \\"Rinse the raindrops\\", \\"Magic\\" is vintage Mac and can bring tears if you have followed he and linda these years. This disc should have \\"grammy\\"written all over it. Even Dylan now that he is co herient again got away with one of those a year or two ago. Hey, if you dont like Paul thats fair we all have our likes and dislikes. I am simply saying as someone who loves all sorts of music and has followed a man who has written an overwhelming amout of great music and help change the music world deserves a break now and again from the old bull shots with the mindless trashing that some time comes around about him. These tracks could have been on The white album / Abbey road etc and they would be thought of as classic's. At sixty years old to be this revelant is probally cause for jealosy by many, maybe that's why the guy gets such a hard time some time. Get this album if you love great music that makes you feel special. I rather listen to paul at his worst than the manufactured Boy bands or or Jackson and his 1980 dance steps revisited. If these people can continually be considered great that Mac is a GOD!Brittney????????????????????????? Great job Paul to an old warrior who can still shame the twentysomethings!!!!!!!

B00005RFAI|5.0|I was very surprised when I listened to this CD when I first got it. Just as the other reviews tell you, Pink's style has almost completely changed! I love it, though and here's what I have to say about each track:<BR>1. M!ssundaztood-(8/10)-A poppish song with a good guitar sound to it. Decent chorus and a hilarious part about an Exlax commercial at the end of it!<br />2.Don't Let Me Get Me-(8/10)-A fast rock song. It has good lyrics and a nice chorus. This could be Pink's theme song. <br />3.Just Like A Pill-(10/10)-Rock song with cool lyrics and an extremely catchy chorus! <br />4.Get The Party Started-(10/10)-Everyone has heard this great dance jam!<br />5.Respect-(9/10)-I love the verses more than the chorus. The lyrics are real clever. <br />6.18 Wheeler-(10/10)Great rock song about Pink's confidence and strength!<br />7.Family Portrait-(9/10)-A mid tempo R&amp;B'ish song with some deep issues about her family. <br />8.Misery-(10/10)-Very Blues/Rockish ballad. Pink's voice is amazing on this song, especially at the end. Steven Tyler harmonizes with her beautifully. <br />9.Dear Diary(10/10)-One of the best on the album. The sound is very &quot;polished&quot; and smooth. Great catchy chorus. <br />10.Eventually-(5/10)-Definitely the worst song on the album. Basically has no real tune to get into.<br />11.Lonely Girl-(10/10)-Rock song with Linda Perry which is mid tempo. Great chorus with great lyrics. <br />12.Numb(10/10)-Great song all the way through. Has a Fiona Appleish sound to it. I love the guitar used on verses.<br />13.Going To Calafornia(7/10)-OK ballad about how Calafornia is. The lyrics are very worth listening to. <br />14.My Vietnam(8/10)-It's cool how you can hear the sounds of army helicopters in the song. I think she tends to exaggerate her lyrics on this one but all in all it's great. <br />This is a must have album for any Rock, Pop, Dance, Blues, and possibly R&amp;B fan. P!nk may have changed lots but she still rocks!
B00005JKO3|2.0|The best movie of the spanish epic and a valious video for the knowledge of the medieval spanish history.
B00005LOUS|5.0|This movie was marvelous! Sure it was different from the cartoon version.... but that's what makes it so great!  They kept the original story line and used all the same words, so I don't know why so many people are complaining that it's so different and awful!  It was great for adults and kids.  Jim Carrey did a WONDERFUL job as the Grinch.  He made the movie!!! I laughed so hard.. he's hilarious!  If you've never seen this movie.. you MUST and DON&quot;T believe people that tell you it wasn't good!  IT WAS and it's worth every penny!  I bought it and am going to watch it year round.... not just at Christmas time!
B00005QXXO|4.0|When I saw Radiohead (...) at Liberty St Park in NJ, I was absolutely floored by how amazing they sounded live.  I was more impressed by how well the material off of the last two albums was recreated with a skill and intensity that is rare to find these days.  Many bands would shy away from trying to recreate those sounds in a live setting but Radiohead suceeded and in my opinion, they did the closet thing to playing Sgt. Pepper live.<br />That being said, I was looking forward to hearing this album and I must say that these recordings take me back to that perfect summer evening when Radiohead worked their magic.  I give this album four stars only because of its length.  If they are putting out a DVD of an entire performance, then I can forgive this but if not, I really do hope that they release more live material.
6302891272|5.0|For what it's worth, I am not especially a fan of Kurosawa, Japanese cinema, or anything else of that nature. I also think Shakespeare is boring as hell. But I worship &quot;Throne of Blood&quot;. This is without question the best adaptation of Macbeth ever by anyone. Awe-inspiring, gritty photography, creepy witches, and an ending that is so visually stunning that it will never leave your mind...just a few of the things this film has to offer. And pretentious as this may sound, I believe this is the most &quot;spiritually faithful&quot; version of Macbeth ever recorded. It is entertaining and poetic in a way that Shakespeare's play might have been to it's original audience. I like this film more than any other Kurosawa film and I wish they'd hurry up and put it on DVD. If you've ever tried to &quot;get into&quot; either Kurosawa or Shakespeare and found yourself rather bored, &quot;Throne of Blood&quot; will help you understand what all the excitement is about.
B000009EAD|5.0|Iced Earth has their fair share of detractors who accuse them of being unoriginal. It's impossible to deny that they are not a groundbreaking band, but at the same time they are entirely unique. A combination of 80s thrash Metallica and Iron Maiden's storytelling and melodic songwriting, they work for me on many levels. For one thing, there are not many bands around making this kind of music...that is, down-to-earth heavy metal. Furthermore, no band of comparable style can compare to Iced Earth's stellar songwriting ability, passion, and integrity. Jon Schaffer's soul is in this music. Also, there is no rhythm guitarist who can match Schaffer's unique style, which is bone-crushingly heavy with intricate use of triplets and 16th notes. Awesome stuff! But is Iced Earth a genre-smashing, innovative band? Not really.<br />\\"If you don't do it first or better, you shouldn't do it.\\" So Iced Earth didn't do it first. What becomes important is how Iced Earth -- in pretty much every way -- transcends the music of their influences. Credit guitarist Jon Schaffer, who merges muscular, dense, thrash-inflected riffery with a melodic subtlety that few metal bands in history have matched. The thick, fiercely heavy grooves are inescapable -- the devastating thrash-driven \\"Stand Alone\\"; the machine-gun like riffing of \\"My Own Savior.\\" However, that melodic quality persists, especially on dynamic tracks that balance big riffs with quiet acoustic moments. \\"Watching Over Me\\" layers clean notes of electric guitars over soft acoustic chords. For the chorus, it kicks into high gear with massive, anthemic power chords. For music with such brutal power, it's amazing how the songs possess hooks that snag your ears.<br />Then there's vocalist Matt Barlow, whose sonorous baritone voice is unique, ferocious, and powerful. If you don't think he's one of the best, most dynamic voices in metal, you must come from another planet. (A planet I won't be visiting any time soon!) When you compare the emotive, soulful performance of \\"Watching Over Me\\" to the nigh-feral screams of \\"Disciples of the Lie,\\" it's difficult to imagine that this is the same singer. This dynamic quality, along with the sheer richness of his tone, is incredible. \\"Watching Over Me\\" also shows that Iced Earth is a metal band capable of showing human warmth, which is due in no small part to Barlow (Schaffer's personal lyric -- about the death of a close friend -- helps, too).<br />The songs soar, and they're indelible too. Rarely can music so heavy be coupled with choruses you want to sing along with. \\"Stand Alone\\" has a hook that's impossible to resist, with the kind of rousing chorus that makes you want to raise your fist into the air. \\"Blessed Are You\\" is one of the many songs balancing quiet acoustic passages with massive, concentrated riffing. I never thought a song that talks about \\"children of the night\\" could have such an inspiring chorus. (\\"Blessed are you   Blessed am I   Children of the night...\\") \\"Disciples of the Lie\\" is pure, unadulterated thrash...something I haven't heard in a long time! The lyrics to \\"Consequences\\" read out more like a speech than poetry (subtlety, Schaffer, subtlety!), but the music is incredible, a powerful rock ballad. \\"1776\\" is a Maiden-esque instrumental, but with way heavier guitars. Big, anthem-like riffing, nuance-filled drums, and delicate overlays of flutes make for one of the finest straight metal instrumentals in years. \\"The Reaping Stone\\" reminds me a bit of Metallica's \\"The Thing That Should Not Be,\\" but with an explosive fast & heavy section that hits you like a derailed train.<br />Some bands like to save the best for last. Iced Earth arguably does so here, concluding the album with a trilogy of songs that tells the possible story of \\"something wicked\\" that will bring about the downfall of the human race. (Uh oh!) Part 3, \\"The Coming Curse,\\" brings forth Schaffer's progressive leanings. The 9-minute track starts with a harrowing piano overture setting a dismal tone. This mood is shattered by mammoth, aggressively-paced riffing. A quiet interlude brings back a theme from part 1, \\"Prophecy,\\" and melds it with male & female opera vocals for atmosphere. You have to hear this song.<br />Well, take that recommendation further. You have to hear this album...and this band. If you were into heavy metal in the 80s and are disgusted with the corruption of the genre, don't walk, RUN and buy this album. Iced Earth may become your bastion of hope for the survival of true, uncompromising heavy metal.etting a dismal tone. This mood is shattered by mammoth, aggressively-paced riffing.

0792156684|5.0|I have never been a big fan of this type of film, but after I was fourced to go I absolutly feel in love with the movie,Titanic remains to be the only movie ever to make me cry. A movie has never afftected me the way this one did, and still does. As far a accuracy, if anyone can find another film about titanic which you think is more accurate I'll be very suprised. The performances of Kate Winslet, Leo Dicaprio, and Billy Zane are fabulous, especially at such young ages. See the movie, ignore the infants trying to bash the movie.
B000024D4R|5.0|While The Wall and Dark Side Of The Moon may be Pink Floyds most well known albums, IMO I believe that Animals and Wish You Were Here are their best, with Animals just edging out WYWH.<br />The albums intro and outro are both simple and short acoustic pieces that set the mood perfectly, then the first song Dogs (which is Pink Floyds best song too) sets in for it's 18 minutes, just amazing solo's from Gilmour...Pigs has an erie mood to it and the albums last real song, Sheep is the obvious climax with it's pure rock riffage.  <br />The concept of the album is great too.
B000023VR6|5.0|I totally love this CD and play it weekly - still after all this time.  I bought it when it first came out, and instantly became my fave rap or hip hop CD.  But I'm a white guy, 51 and live in the suburbs.  So who says Dre doesnt have broad appeal?  This is great stuff, you cant sit down when its on.  Catch me some day with the windows rolled down on the freeways of Southern California singing out loud to Forget About Dre and give me a thumbs up.
B00005LOUQ|2.0|This movie had potential; but leave it to Ron Howard to totally ruin a classic. Jim Carey could have been great, but the tasteless scenes of him eating glass and closeups of the termites in his teeth totally ruin this movie. I know the grinch is ugly, but they went overboard. The silly makeup takes away from the story. I was so busy looking at the noses and hair that I couldn't get into the story. The only word I can think of is &quot;tasteless.&quot; I rented this for my family and only the 7-year-old liked it; however, we all enjoyed the cartoon version.
B00005QDW5|5.0|I bought this expecting great music but I was blown away at how good this collection was. Shine On You Crazy Diamond has at last been issued on it's complete form instead of fragmented. Syd Barret has several great Floyd songs on here as well. Re-mastered and the songs flow very well together. Get it!
