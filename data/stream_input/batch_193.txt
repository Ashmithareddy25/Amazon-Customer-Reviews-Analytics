B003XS3JC2|5|This is one of the best hair clip I have. I have a thick hair and this clips are peefect. So easy to put on and to take off. I will order more in future. Just hope that they were abit cheaper.
B000OIFZAS|5|i love to buy lip gloss more than lipstick , i liked this product when i used it , it makes my lips looks national, and doesn't get dry, and keep them soft
B009F5GIHK|5|This is a truly lovely scent -- it's my daily favorite!
B0007A09G8|5|Love this stuff.  Light coconut scent, extremely moisturizing.
B001KOTRF4|5|Excellent purchase. It arrived on time and brand new. Great packing. Was very excited to find this fragrance.
B004RZPXZ6|5|Great product! Love the scent
B00BL18J78|1|Couldn't find Original (not High Endurance) variety, so I bought this.  The odor is enough to smell up the house and affect your every smell and taste all day. I had to shower again and throw it away!
B00KAOLF5U|5|I am just learning how to use makeup as a grownup. This is a beautiful set. I am very excited to use all of them!! They come in a very nice storage bag. Very happy with my purchase. Fast shipping.
B00EBZEANI|4|You can definitely feel it drawing the gunk out of your pores. I don't give it 5 stars because it's No miracle product,  but for the price it's about excellent product.
B0043P0K12|5|Works like a charm.
B000F97FA4|5|I know some people's sensibilities are offended by paying money for a tiny spray can of water.  However, this is an indispensable item when you're out and about during the summer, especially traveling.  A little mist from this on your face is really refreshing and won't really mess up your makeup.  It's nice in the dry air of airplanes as well.  It's also great for perfunctory hand-washing, if you're really in a pinch.  This is a really handy product and I almost always have one with me.
B00AMAR74K|5|This cream makes my skin feel great and hydrated.  I use it on my face.  I have sensitive skin and this works great!  It even came with a key to squeeze all of the product from the tube.
B00P8XOOWO|4|Took a while to get here ..its gos on a little more thick  than I.wanted but still works good! Its does dry fast and  dosnt smear
B000VPWGNS|5|The price is an excellent value compared to stores.<br />The service is fast and reliable.  Product arrived packed well and without damage.
B000BYSKBQ|5|I cannot believe that I'm having breakouts in my 50's but this product keeps them to a minimum.  My skin feels clean, especially when I also use it with the Precleanse product.
B000X2HB9S|5|This is great so many different attachments & the battery lasts forever!
B001EAYZEW|5|Perhaps one of the most worthwhile purchases I have ever made. The very first time you use it, if you have a lot of hair to remove, it will BURN LIKE THE FIRES OF HADES in a sort of addicting way. But after that, it's fine. You have to go over an area several times to remove all the hair, but once you're done, it takes a while to grow back in and it grows back thinner. I use this a lot, in a lot of places. I even use it on my arms (soooo smoooooooth).
B001TVURXY|5|Absolutely love this stuff!  Works great and smells wonderful.
B0089E3ZTM|2|Let me say that if this product had continued to work I would have loved it.  I loved the versatility of having the multiple size barrels.  I loved how hot it got and how fast it heated up.  What I didn't like - really didn't like - was that after 4 1/2 months the cord has a short in it and will not stay on.  For this price the quality should be better.
B0081CWUD4|5|My kids made me buy it, there hair looks fine and the smell isnt' too strong.
B008PJZXT6|5|Wish I had gotten this a long time ago! Great at getting those rough spots gone quick. Heavy duty calloused areas will use a roller up pretty quickly though.
B002HMCIOK|2|it does it's job i guess but it's quite large and bulky so one of my end toes either has to be left out or over stretched
B004DIXYUI|5|I have been looking for a translucent powder and this one is it. I tend to use my brush and not the puff that came with it just because I don't want to dirty it. But it's perfect.
B001ET764E|5|I have been using this product for many years and can highly recommend it. It keeps my skin dry and does not result in irritation which my skin is prone to get from many deodorants, but not this one.
B00192QCRI|3|I'm 61 years old and have some brown spots and light spider veins on my legs.  This product only covered them slightly, like a very sheer stocking.  I was hoping for more coverage.
B00MCGZ0UA|5|I love this product.  The texture, the smell and the affect is amazing.  I have been using it everyday and it's especially good because my hair has a double process dye in it and tends to get dry and limp.  This conditioner is made for my hair.  It adds moisture and volume and I don't need to use a lot to get a great result.  I feel like my hair is normal with volume, instead of dry and treated! - Lorraine
B000EGIF02|5|I do not use this product as frequent as required. My hair is very curly and does not require frequent shampooing.  I use this product one a week.  I have felt a difference in my hair.  It feels thicker.
B00EWO96IM|5|I love all products which use aloe in them, vaseline aloe fresh, safeguard soap, anything aloe so when I saw this soap I had to try it. It smells great, its not too overwhelming its just lightly scented, I love the color and it's fantastic! Great find! ANd it's MADE IN THE USA!!!!
B003XU30TC|5|great product/transaction
B00GI9O9B8|2|Stiff and very unnatural looking I will stick with my Red Cherry lashes.  If you are looking for an over the top very temporary look maybe you can rock these.
B000PC2H7C|5|Great product! Holds my very thick, long, curly hair but without any stiffness.
B00WLAZ87W|5|Bought these for my wife and she said she loves them!  &#34;Glamorous&#34; as she put it.  They go on easily and don't rub off like some cheap temporary tattoos do.  She said it was a breeze taking it off following the directions.
B001O8R0AA|5|This is a great skin care system.  Very happy with the purchase.
B003CP12F2|4|this was a gift for my husband and he tells me that it is no improvement over the previous model  too bad / sort of a waste of money!  not an amazon issue....
B00PTSTFWM|3|OK. Doesn't fit me right
B00CM08IWI|5|Beautiful color and hydration!  Great price and fast delivery!
B004TYD87A|4|Smells delicious!
B00LU28QB2|5|BEST THEY EVER MADE
B007C33V4A|5|Absolutely love it. Beautiful in color and shape.
B001O4K20E|5|Each soap is elegantly wrapped in tissue and held in place with the Roger & Gallet seal.  it's a treat to unwrap; it's an even better treat to use the creamy soap with the subtle, never overpowering, scent.
B00E94FB0M|3|good colors, too many of bigger sizes
B002TMJB7K|4|Very cute. My daughter will love it. The packaging was a mess and missing parts, but since it is going in a stocking, that is not too critical.
B00E2U2NKY|5|I searched and searched for this replacement for my husband's trimmer. No stores carry it I was happy that I found it on Amazon. This is the ONLY trimmer he will use for his tough beard and is very happy with the product. The first one lasted over 3 years being used just about everyday. Great product!
B00892ZQSM|5|Beautiful Tiara!! We Love It!!
B001V9SR72|4|works good.
B002JULAPI|5|I started using this early in my pregnancy to comfort my tight skin while my tummy was growing and couldn't recommend it more!  Since being pregnant, I have done a lot of research on anything that I put on my body and the Environmenal Working Group rated this product as having the safest score on their cosmetic database - this made me feel comfortable slathering it on both morning and night without the worrying about the risk of any funky chemicals being absorbed and potentially affecting our baby.  I am 33 weeks now and have had no skin discomfort or stretch marks (although it seems that hereditary has more to do with stretch marks than what you actually put on your skin).  At first, it was a little hard to get out of the can, but I figured out the best way to use it is to just use the back of my fingernail to scoop some out, rub my hands together and apply in a circular motion.
B0027GCNGY|5|Well, it seems the naysayers from the FDA and Big Pharma have joined the discussion of MMS. Their trolls are always sneaking into blogs and forums to paint any natural remedy with the 'fraud brush'. Funny, their products are the ones that are totally ineffective and dangerous.<br /><br />People, MMS works. Read Jim Humble's website. See the many letters of appreciation from communities, governments, and countries! People are being cured, CURED of malaria and other ailments.<br /><br />Ignore the trolls from the drug paradigm. They're just whining and groaning because they know the world is catching onto their big scam.
B00198HI1Q|5|I use it daily.  Won't do without it.
B0072BA5MS|5|This is a great trimmer, but I truly like the tweezers with light that came with it.  Helps you see the hairs in very good light.
B003LWH4H6|5|This makeup remover does a wonderful job removing make - up gently without causing any irritation.  I would definitely recommend it!
B001LGEC4W|5|I recently got a bridge crown replacing my two upper front teeth. The space between the gum and the bridge is so tight that I can't use any pick (I tried several brands). This threader works great and is definitely the most hygienic solution. It's easy to use as well. The product may be a little pricy at first sight, but if it prevents any decay of the remaining tooth structure it's well worth it.
B000QF17SS|4|This isn't the same gentle home perm I  ordered last time although it is close. It has more steps. I like the less steps better. This one didnt last very long because I used rods that were too big. Next time I will go back to my old rods and perm I hope. There is nothing wrong with this perm. It is very good. It came quickly and was packaged perfectly.
B0043BWDBQ|1|The original description did not include 'vanilla woods', so I thought it was unscented shea soap. Arrived and couldn't use, don't care for vanilla, far to sweet for myself and friend who I offered it too. Eventually found a recipient for it. I don't consider myself sensitive to odors (work in medical field with all sorts of people and body fluids) and found this scent unappealing.
B0033DYLNS|5|This product is really nice.  It goes on like body cream, it doesn't smell &#34;medicine-y&#34;, it isn't greasy.  It feels like it disappears BUT, the bugs don't bother me!  It is great!
B004GIHQQI|5|This product is light weight and effective at giving volume to my hair. i recommend it very enthusiastically and am disappointed it is being discontinued.
B00461F4PA|5|amazing beauty product. Probably in my top 5. Works great. The only thing is that it's a little gross having all the skin peel off your feet so I wouldn't do it in the summer. Definitely need 2 weeks in socks!
B003Y054CM|4|The only initial complaint was light thingy. The goofy thing wouldn't come on the first time I tried using it so I had to stuff a small square of tissue between the batteries and the door/cap to make it come on and off. It seems like they made the compartment for the batteries too big so the batteries don't press together and pass energy from between them and into the positive connector that powers the light so it's annoying trying to get it working at first. Once I got it to work it did help the brightening process by a lot. I would whiten for upwards of 30 minutes without the light and this cut that time by just about a half and the results are brighter with the light than it would be without. You don't feel any heat on your teeth from the light either.
B00ANTDQL8|5|This polish is AMAZING.  You need at LEAST 2 coats of it though and you definitely have to get pure acetone to get it off! You also need a color polish underneath before you apply this.  Definitely a great product, though!
B00KRZVIJA|3|Too narrow
B0075JPZUY|5|Great product. I use in combination with CLA (can also purchase through Better Body Sports). I take the C-Bolic in the morning prior to eating breakfast and in the afternoon prior to eating lunch. I definitely notice a difference in body composition when using this product. Helps to burn fat, while building muscle- which is what you want to do!!! These products help to give your body that nice shape.
B00FOGXH3W|5|Any other colors? Smooth and precise lines.
B008PJZXT6|1|Product was horrible… Once applied to the foot the motor would stop.. Item was defective from the start with no power. Has to be plugged in at all times. Seller does not stand behind return policy and charges you even for defective items. I had to pay to ship it back to the seller.
B007FTZ766|5|Best beard conditioner I've ever found.
B00JDTFBXA|5|Started using this product a few days ago and I'm already seeing the difference. I fly a lot so my skin get very dry and damaged my pores are staring to shrink and my skin is not drying out as quickly on the plane I would highly recommend this product
B004QBC65G|5|I LOVE this lipstick. It lasts almost all day, it's matte, but doesn't dry your lips out. It has a nice creamy consistancy. I own this in Pomegranate, and it's an amazing color. I wear red lipstick most days of the week. My coworkers are always commenting on how well I pull it off, but everyone agrees this is the best shade of red. I have a very light complexion with pink undertones. I want to buy every color they make!
B00FRDPNH0|4|Nice hair care product.  This is a medium hold, so it didn't work as well with my finer hair as it did for my teenage son who is blessed with his mother's thicker hair.  The medium hold leaves hair a bit wavy and flexible - perfect for those whose hair doesn't need as much help.  The scent is nice, too - kind of light, and not overpowering.
B001105Y7M|5|a fresh burst of clean greatfruit. this colgne  smells soo good,  highly recommend to any age . you wont be dissapointed
B00Q11QLR8|5|Amazing!!!
B000AUIFCA|5|Always a good purchase.
B00FMVWU96|4|I couldn't get these to work like the instructions indicated, but it didn't take much imagination to apply them anyway. They're lovely and lasted long.
B000143JSK|5|thing untangled my daughters long thick hair. I love this stuff and there is no build up
B002XO4LDI|5|I tried this  as a sample from another website, and when I found out the cost, I couldn't justify it.  I went to Amazon and there it was  - $60.00 cheaper.  It is a great product for dry sensitive skin, my skin has never looked better, I really do like this product!
B00MSSEJTU|5|Great wig, great quality, was a hit at the party!
B00M3H0ISM|5|love the scent.
B00FZIUHL4|5|I have alopecia and my hair is thinning rapidly. I was told not much could be done for my alopecia but surprisingly after using this product I noticed reversal in some of the thinning and balding areas on my head. My advice, don’t give up and try this out! If it has worked this well for me then I am sure it can work for others too.
B00A4627F6|5|Was not expecting this to ship so quickly and was very pleased with the product! It has kept my tattoo in great shape and I love that it doesn't leave an &#34;after-tan&#34; strong smell to my body.
B00H60V9Q6|3|The seller sent me these as one bottle full and the other was used (over half the bottle was empty). The packages the rollerballs originally came in were sort of weathered and torn, it looks like both of them were previously opened and used. The seller listed these as &#34;new&#34; and they were not. However, other sellers were listing one rollerball for $25, and I got 1.5 for $25 so I decided to keep them. I was put off by the fact that these were already used, and had to disinfect the rollerball since I had no way of knowing where it had been.
B004N13F1S|5|i like product a lot
B002T0Q6O8|5|it desrve to have 5 star rating, smells good and strengthens your hair, I hope you won't increase your price, so I can keep ordering from you
B0020ZEA40|5|I will be buying more of their products.. It works wonders for my skin and I no longer wear foundation.. My skin is olive.. I'm Pakistani and this product is perfect for my skin color
B001LNTNGC|5|This is the second tube of this product I have had. The first tube lasted me a year. I got hooked when I went to a Murad free makeover at a local store and the lady put this product on me. I have a tendency to get greasy quickly over the course of my day. But this product is so effective. It's magic. I actually stopped using it so much because I got lazy, but found I didn't need it as much. I dont know if my skin chemistry just changed or if the product had something to do with it. Regardless, I will never allow myself to be without this product.
B002T4K186|3|I have used this every day for 30 minutes for 2 weeks now and see very little change in the color of my teeth. Not sure why?
B00JXIJTKM|1|I bought several bottles of this and tried it out for  approx 3 months. It did nothing.
B005C5FP9Y|1|I was really disappointed because it's been 3 months and I guess I should stop looking in my mailbox for them. All my other orders came and I was happy with what I did recieve.
B000YYYZ5S|5|This order came as promised, and in a timely manner.  This Kenra product is the best spray out there for my hair.<br /><br />And this size is perfect for traveling.<br /><br />MIDottie
B00CV1YCDC|3|for the price, this is a great steal. most of the colors, but not all, are well pigmented, and last fairly long with a primer on my eyes. the contour and blushes are nice too. this product can not in any way be compared to nicer palettes, however it is a great beginner or amateur kit. i personally enjoy this palette kit, but would not recommend it to anyone looking for a high end or middle end makeup palettte
B006HUFG7O|5|I would recommend a longer handle with factory cut surface for a sure grip with wet fingers while shaving. You get no slippage from the Weber Razor Long Handle along with good balance.
B000FEIOHW|5|I had battery operated toothbrushes but this is a game changer. My teeth felt so clean, like a hygienist cleaned them. I like it is battery operated. I don't have room for another charger on my sink. Great product.
B004B4JSTA|5|I have been using this product for several years and I love it..Has a medium firm hold and it smell good
B000U83UAY|5|This scent is wonderful! I found a sample in my glamour magazine & didn't want to pay full price for this so I ordered from Amazon.com. It was a good price & the seller had it shipped quickly. Not to strong, but stays on well.
B007VI6512|5|I have used and hoarded many different designs of these stips. I find that if I cut my nails short and neat, I can get 2 applications from one pack. I hate to waste, especially on the limited edition designs. Love 'em!!
B00454UF70|5|This was also a thank you gift for a friend to use on her vacation trip and she dearly loved it.  Her favorite had been Lou Lou  by Cacharel but she feel in love with this new one Cashmere and wants to order a larger size for her dressing table, so that was good news, love it when they love their token gifts.
B00HC6LVJO|3|I thought these nails had glitter on them like the headline says but they dont have glitter and i wish they werent so long also box came broken but still usable the top part falls off when you open it
B007W15WEY|1|Terrible. It arrived messed up like it was being used & it has no shine at all.
B000FD98ZA|5|1st used this on a cruise spa years back.  Nothing can top it.  Best face cream for anyone with drying, older skin.  Love it.
B0026QOA02|5|Love it...
B000CNIHKU|5|Great cologne at a great price. Fast shipping as well. I would recommend this purchase to anyone looking for an expensive cologne at an inexpensive price.
B00JUB2CBU|3|It is OK. i don't like that it gets mold really quick tough.
B004WAASO2|5|I decided to give this Volumizing Leave-In Spray a try, and I'm glad I did. After using Hair One Hair Cleanser/Conditioner as directed, I sprayed a little of this spray on the underside of my hair. I was delighted with the results on my fine thin hair.
B0047PSV14|5|Works as well as the salon!
B00QDFKQW8|4|Smells incredible. I wish it wasn't quite so expensive though. Plus it doesn't produce much bubbles but the smell is absolutely divine!
B007MNYY14|5|I have been using WEN for a year now and really like how my hair feels, but I just can't afford it anymore. I saw this product and thought I would give it a try. It is BETTER than WEN! It left my hair soft and shiny and not weighed down. I have fine hair so I could only use WEN once a week and then I would use my normal shampoo. I found with Salon Graphix, I can use it 2-3 days in a row and my hair looks amazing. I will definitely make the switch permanently.
B00K4EP6NI|4|I loooove this lippie. I wish it would stay on longer because the color is magnificent.
B001P2K82M|4|The applicator is incredibly annoying to use, but the color and the price more than make up for that.<br /><br />Long-wear on my slightly dry, normal type skin.
B00NOCQ0EQ|5|[[VIDEOID:71bbded65fd3c2a36915165e0ea41971]]I have suffered with severe acne for 10+ years. I stumbled on Salic one day and I took a risk ordering it. It was the best decision I've ever made. I use this at night after toning and just dab a little heavy moisturizer over my jawline afterwards, where I tend to get dry and its amazing. Within 2-3 weeks of buying this I've had zero active breakouts.   + It does not over dry me at all! It has the perfect balance of moisture and acne fighting ingredients.  + One pump is good for the whole face (don't go overboard, it should last 3 months or so). + I even take it onto my shoulders or neck if I have a minor blemish there and it is better than any spot treatment I've tried, and I've tried it all!  + Since buying this product I have NOT used a spot treatment even once! and I've practically lived on them for years. - Its not great for under makeup because it is an acne fighter, but I use this before bed so it doesn't matter.  I hope this brand gets more recognition & others find confidence in their skin from it as well! If this is ever discontinued for some crazy reason please notify me so I can order all of it! This is the only thing that has ever worked for me and I am so appreciative. I've already repurchased! I would highly recommend!
B0002QWTXI|5|Love the bath sponges!!
B006L1DNWY|5|they are perfect for making my nail designs and at a great price. i would recommend this product for doing detailed nail designs
B00O19V5SC|5|I used this product first on my face with makeup and it worked great.  I didnt have to use a makeup remover and I found it to work well without scrubbing my face off.  It has a soft texture and lathered up nice without water.  My face felt clean but not stripped of natural oils.  I have sensitive skin and this product is by far the best I have used on my face for cleansing.
B004K0MSOM|5|Great!!
B007MKVSBQ|1|The only thing worth while is the case, manicure tools are really poorly made, nail clipper broke first time i used it.
B0014ATI58|5|This is the best cream I have ever found. It actually has a healing, soothing effect to sensitive skin as well as great exfoliation. Any one who has super sensitive skin will love this cream. My health food store no longer carries it but thanks to Amazon I can continue to buy it.
B00CMFKZEC|5|Well made, works fine, good value.
B00LNIW1EQ|5|People are really complimenting my smile. I use this product only twice a week but it has great results for me. Thanks Brilliant Hd.
B001DKMY9Q|1|I had many electric shaver in the past 15 years, and this one is at bottom of that list.  VERY DISAPPOINTED! It cuts pretty good around cheek, and not at all for the chin and neck
B00CLILRMY|5|Excelent prodact.
B008TBTAAI|5|Excellent scissors. Wiould definitely buy again.
B00OIC3WBU|4|Love this stuff!!  Made my shaved areas smell nice and made them very smooth!
B000URWZC4|5|This is a great product.  My sponges have lasted longer than twenty uses.
B005BYXWLO|2|I Like the colors, but i was disappointed about the size of the packages of hair. I thought the bundle was going to be bigger.
B00NV6YQ9Q|5|A little different than what I thought it would look like but still very nice and a goid price
B004I8NO8A|5|These clippers work great, so far. They could have included some instructions though. I see a few people haven't figured out how to adjust the guards different depths with the button on the back.   Cut my sons hair, which is VERY thick... and it didn't hang up once. What was really great was the texturing/ thinning feature. It thinned out his thick, course hair very well.   Cuts great, cleans easily, no snags or hair pulling... I would recommend this hair clipper/ beard trimmer to anyone.
B001GNBVRQ|5|Great product highly recommend.
B00147FGJ8|2|I didn't notice any difference when using this product. It also has a strange smell that wasn't appealing to me. I won't be using it again.
B004C380X0|5|I've been using this for 2 weeks now (3 x a week), and it did the job for this really pale girl. I'm not dark bronze, but am much noticeably darker. Its def a good starter lotion. Ive used lotions in the past that made me streaky because they bronzed too intensely for my skin color, but this did not do that. I also like the smell a lot, and it has a nice little shimmer.
B002WTC38O|5|Works the same if not better than Grande Lash. Great to save $$
B00SNS1K82|5|👍👍👍👍👍love it
B00ESG76TU|3|Got it for my oyster it moves a little bit on the blade. Make sure you find out if you are getting the single magnetic or the double magnetic the difference is very noticeable.
B004Z209HS|5|Extremely happy with this product! It works SO much better on my acne-prone skin that organic coconut oil.
B00AX9Y1FS|5|I love them. Makes your skin feel so smooth and soft.
B004WPHE3K|5|I saw this at Ross and quickly searched reviews online before buying. So many of you said this was a great product. So for around $5, I thought why not. I have thick, long, wavy hair (Hispanic), so I thought this would probably not work. WRONG! I followed many other uses' advice and really worked it into my hair in sections while in the shower. I rubbed it thoroughly through my scalp. Not only did my hair seem less tangled, but it was also surprisingly clean. I even tried this product on 2 day hair with hairspray in it. I do have pretty healthy hair because I don't color or use heat everyday BUT I still get tangles and frizz. This really seemed to help with that. I would highly recommend this AND am going back to hopefully find more!<br />Side note- I tried my friend's Wen and it was ok. She said to keep trying it, but I did not want to spend that much money so that's why this sparked my curiosity at the store. Glad it did :)
B003H86G5K|4|Loved the lip stain! the color was just beautiful and gave a nice matte finish that just popped. The only downside is that it wears off pretty easily. Other than that, I love both the scent and the color, was skeptical at first because it does look and feel like a marker lol, but overall it is a nice product.
B002HWS9FW|5|this is third time to purchase this brush.<br /><br />Not like the expensive one but still has good quality.<br /><br />Try it if you are looking for an electric toothbrush.
B0000ZLEJG|2|Take the cap off and sniff, and you'll get a light whiff of this perfume. Not bad, really. But, roll it on and the scent disappears. I've used it several times and the result is the same...nothing. I can only think that it is just too weak to have a scent when spread thinly on the skin. I am aware that an individual's personal chemistry can affect perfumes, but I expect some scent, even if different once applied. Disappointing, to say the least, and I am afraid I cannot recommend this product.
B0086VIAB6|5|These things work and work well.  I got the Sonicare a while back on a whim and have been amazed at how well it works.  Easy to use, quick, and way more effective than flossing in half the time.  Other than periodic changing of the tips this machine requires no maintenance.  The only downside is that since they are such a limited market only Philips makes the tips.  Amazon does a great job with add-on purchases though so replacement is easy and relatively inexpensive.
B007N3ETTA|4|Lip gloss & powder are fine. Mascara was dried out. These are very small sample sizes
B00JLPM8AK|4|This seems to be working although it takes awhile to really see results.  I am happy so far with this item.
B000YL7GT8|5|Exactly what I wanted! A friend of mine had surgery and I got this as a &#34;Get Well&#34; balloon. It certainly brightened his spirits :)
B007FXZZWI|5|Best deodorant ever.  I bought them for my whole family. I highly recommend this product!!!
B00EKFJDWC|5|Bought these for my daughter because the other ones that I got her at Target kept loosing the bristles - these so far a great and she really likes them -- lots of brushes for the money!!  don't shed on her face.
B006558F4W|5|Beautiful color, nice and shiny, wears well.  Makes a great addition to anyone's polish collection!
B00I4IYHXQ|5|We've only had them a week, but based on my initial assessment I love them. They are well made, hold well in hair and are easy to use. I especially love the fact that there are two matching ones in each color. The color range is nice.<br /><br />My almost-2-year-old has an average size head and we're able to use two of these without them looking like they're too big for her head.
B0000535CI|4|Those this product work on women ?
B000RPLKNE|2|So small! I could hardly find it! The perfume is hard o get out of the little tiny windy bottle!
B001MA2FCS|5|I found this product through a good friend who said she also suffered from rosacea. Since her skin was flawless I was puzzled until she told me that she had been using MyChelle Capillary Calming Serum. This product, along with the Fruit Enzyme Mist, calmed down my skin within days. Now a little over 2 weeks later, my complexion is as close to flawless as a 58 year old face can be. I am so thrilled that I was not forced to use a chemical prescription but something natural. I highly recommend this product to anyone who is suffering from red, blotchy skin.
B003YMJJSK|5|Love this cleanser.....
B001L1MD2U|5|(This is Shelton's wife Jennifer btw). This cream eye shadow is simply beautiful! It works well on it's own, or my personal favorite is to apply Urban Decay's ABC Gum eye shadow on top. It's long lasting, does not crease, and you get tons of product for the money.
B00DD6DCK8|5|Best tanning mousse I have ever used. The color is perfect for my olive skin and it doesn't leave me looking orange or splotchy.  If you prep well before applying you will not be disappointed. Smells great too!
B00B608EV0|4|My niece loved it!
B00C7PXPXU|5|Good
B00N00SEZA|1|I hate to say this but this is a terrible product.  I smells just like fish oil.  I cannot believe that is 100 percent rosehip oil.  I have used rosehip before unlike this product.  I guess I can cook with it.  It does not  go into skin just stays on the surface.  Keep your money and try another product.
B00AIY9EZK|5|The only hair spray I will buy.
B000W0A78S|5|Perfect
B002RDBL7Y|5|the smell is good
B001E0VBDK|5|Great product! The first time I used it I noticed my skin had less of that dryness were always trying to scrub off. Great great product. I use black soap along with argan and Squalane oil. I'm Italian. Black soap and Castille soap are it for my skin when it comes to washing. No more random black heads on the back or chin. Never a flaky spot. Black soap is just amazing!
B00PWTX3YO|5|This literally changed my life! Sitting on a stool for extended hours at work left me with unbearable lower and upper back pain. I am so glad I gave the maxwell seat a try. No massage or acupuncture could do what this product has done for me. I use it everywhere now.. I wish I would have found this sooner. My back pain has vanished. Simply amazing!
B00PV4TKA6|5|Best hair duo,, smells great, I am so happy that I found these products  and the price can't be beat. These products can be hard to find in your local beauty supply stores,it depends on where you live.
B00AQ8NIC8|5|My hair probably hates me from all the bleaching and dying I put it through...I'm constantly using 40 volume developer to get my hair the lightest shade possible in order to maintain a snowy-white color, and there are times where my hair feels very brittle and falls out while combing or washing it. I've tried other deep conditioners and while they work decently, my hair feels so much better after using this, and it has a nice smell to it, as well. I would recommend this to anyone who wants to get their dry and brittle hair back to almost like-new condition.
B001CT0AGC|5|This stuff reminds me of a more subtle Chrome by Azzaro. I found it a little cheaper on Amazon than it was at Wal-Mart. Thanks Amazon.
B004D248JA|5|great moisturizer at a great price!
B0012FEXMI|5|I wanted an aluminum-free deodorant, and tried several natural products from drug-store shelves that failed miserably (including Toms of Maine and that crystal stuff). Based on reviews I read here and elsewhere, I bought a tub of Yodora, and it has been excellent. I am not a major sweater unless I am exercising hard, and I don't really mind sweat anyway--it's odor that I have to worry about. People should note that this is not an antiperspirant. But it completely controls odor. It appears to have a cumulative effect, because after using it for about a week I noticed I didn't stink if I forgot to put it on after my shower. In the past, going without deodorant would make me majorly stinky by the end of day!<br /><br />The scent of the product is pretty noticeable when you open the tub, but once it's on it's really not powerful. Maybe some of the negative reviewers put on too thick a layer? The scent is a little feminine, but it smells more like Johnson's baby powder to me than flowery perfume. I think a fella could get away with it.
B00K6ZQBMU|4|I give it a 4 star only because the hair is very thin.if you have alot of hair I suggest you buy more than 3 packs.the shipping was just on time and the hair is good quality.I was afraid to order online but I got my money's worth.I bought bleach blonde to color it and it came out great.the hair did not get damaged.only complain is that it's to thin other than that everything is good
B000C219QA|5|Item just as described. Fast Shipping!!
B00J7A4SAW|1|VERY unhappy with this product. I ordered 2, so 100 pot jars. Many of them are cracked. Lots of them the tops won't screw on tightly..they just keep turning. So frustrated I ordered from this seller. Poor product.
B004QNIC1G|5|Great oil! Useful for so many skin problems/injuries! Love it!
B0093UC02Y|5|This is not as good as the refresh H&amp;S, but in is decent. I would say its worth a try . You may just like it.
B007BLN17K|4|I would invest in better brushes if you plan on doing anything delicate or professional. The tips of the brushes look smaller than they really are and even with the smallest brush I have a difficult time applying fine lines.
B004OKBZSS|5|Good
B004P2LL2K|5|Work's great
B00167DC2Y|3|It was like used watch, very simple.    If you want a watch for daily use you can get this.
B008B2Z94Q|4|this item really blends make up well.  I like it, and it was cheap.  I only bought it because it was so cheap and i wanted to try it out.  So if it's still a buck I recommend it even if its anywhere between a buck and 3 bucks, you should get it.
B00C3NVX5S|5|I gave it as a gift and they loved it.
B000RHKD6C|4|I have dry chemically processed hair.  After being told my dark hair was boring I decided to go lighter. Well eventually lighter turned into blonde. My ends were getting dry so I wanted to get a good conditioner to protect my hair. Well, this works. Usually when I use a deep conditioner it works the first couple of times and before I can finish the product it doesn't do anything for my hair. I use this about once a week; sometimes I use this twice a week if I feel like I need to. When my hair air drys it isn't as frizzy or rough.
B007IQN1KU|4|what I ordered, and is good
B008HUOVYG|5|Colors are what I expected i am happy i got it<br />I def recommend to purchase this❤️. Only downfall, colors were dusty a bit messed up but over all happy
B007YQUSKA|5|Love
B0014C4G3A|5|Love these eyeliners!
B006N8G2RS|5|i like these cute little things,very colorful and bright,and definitely different to store contacts,i love them compact, nice price, came fast and good service,will buy again sooo cute
B000U6PW7K|5|The best shampoo for my dandruff
B005JVFP0U|5|The feel and texture of the wig feels like real hair! Excellent product and really long hair! I had other more expensive wigs that were just not as great as this one! Great wig to go clubbing!
B004UXJ55E|5|Got it for my step daughter when she was pregnant works great and smell wonderful work best the coco butter! I used it too for my pregnancy and after saven my legs great stuff and shipped fast!
B000MVYJ0O|5|It is like 2 in one, or 3 in one :)))) because this soap makes peeling, cleans, and smoothes my skin. I like it very much.
B0048MG8PC|5|This hairspray is great. It holds really great without being sticky or heavy. It's really great. This is the only hairspray I'll use.
B007WCH372|4|The best parfum you can get but it DIDN'T COME WITH THE ROSE BRACELET/NECKLASE, please change your picture since you are misadvertisind. VERY DISAPPOINTED but great job on the delivery.
B00MBL1K2S|5|I have a very oily skin. Summer time not do any justice with oily skin type. I purchased the whole set- their vitamin C serum, rose water , and the rosehip oil for me and MY husband. I can not thank enough how amazing these products work. Me and MY husband gets tons of complaints how our skin looks younger, healthy and glowing. I would honestly recommend to use them all together. Works like a magic . My skin feels tight , soft and young .👏👏
B000VOP7YO|5|I Love the very feminine, fresh, enduring scent of this fragrance. Simply beautiful without overpowering. I routinely get asked by passing strangers &#34;what is that fragrance you are wearing&#34;? They appreciate the same things that I do about this scent.
B005TVWMBA|5|Best hair product purchase I've made so far, tried a few sample packets of this product for a few weeks and after using those I had to buy this. Left my hair feeling soft and looking a lot healthier. Not to mention the package was delivered so fast!
B003OELYFO|4|Thickened hair and helped cover bald spots.  Exactly what I needed.  Good product at a reasonable price.  I will buy again.
B00700H128|5|I have used this product for over four months. I love the simple but powerful ingredients. I use it at night. I will keep ordering and using this cream. Makes my skin sooooo soft. Great Product.
B000G1MT2U|5|I get great results each time I use this to style my hair. Dries fast, enhances my curls and smells great. LOVE it! It is one of my staples.
B004S8HLFC|5|This is the best toothpick around. My sister's dentist recommended them to her and I found them here. Great buy....you'll love them!
B00FNUU642|4|I can't say this helped my son's eczema, but it sure did not aggravate it. It makes TONS of bubbles. I would buy it again for a child who doesn't have eczema, just because it is mild, doesn't have a strong annoying scent, and makes nice bubbles.
B001QT3GOQ|5|I've developed an allergy to just about every shampoo I've used.  I've been using this since it came out and as of now, no allergies.  Works as expected.
B00BL18J8W|5|Very good deal
B001FWXS88|5|I never really liked all the toothpastes out there, as they are almost all mint.  I was using the Crest Cinnamon one, until this came out.   It's a very light, but pleasant flavor.  I personally don't taste mint, but it's not straight, overpowering Vanilla either.    Unfortunately, it is getting hard to find on local shelves, so I'm stocking up in case they drop it!
B003EGYDI2|4|This product is much different than the typical heavyweight curling gels. It effectively cuts down tremendously on frizz! Like it!
B000VFWV4W|5|Very happy with my purchase.  I use this product exclusively for moisturizing my face.  It's not at all greasy, and goes on easily.
B003OXEJSE|3|This product definitely saves time for those who have thick and curly hair. It dries the hair quickly and somewhat straight, but it does not style the hair very well. It is very difficult to dry the edges of the hair. I use this to dry my hair and then I style with a curling iron or the vidal sasson 1\\" brush drier. It takes ours to dry hair with the vidal alone, but two of them work great.
B002H988H4|5|This Revlon liquid lipstick is the best. It stays on for hours and the color is beautiful. No need to keep reapplying after eating as you will have lipstick still on. How great is that!
B00FAEOCP0|5|I've tried many mascara and was always disappointed; this mascara does what it says!!!<br /><br />Love it!  I Will purchase again.
B000GREPOY|1|The butter was too thick and hard to use--actually it is quite hard.
B0014272VI|5|I'm 35 and have struggled with acne for many years. I was using Proactiv but felt like it was too expensive and wasn't helping much anyway. So I have been searching for replacements for some of their products and found this mask. I never really noticed any difference in my skin when I used the Proactiv mask but I still used it faithfully. Since I've been using the Mint Julep Masque my skin has been a lot softer and I've had less breakouts. I've only been using it on the weekends but I've still noticed a difference. I'm not saying it's a miracle or anything but it's really worked well for me. It also rinses off super easy which is always nice.
B0002OCNMC|5|This soap was for my husband, he loves it and I love it.  Great smell.
B0086BB21Q|5|Gave this to my son for Christmas. He is a bat man guy at 30 years old. His first question was dad were did you find this? I told him in my chair at Amazon. I don't see a 6th star for that.
B0009OAHQY|5|Bought this for my brother for Christmas.  He really likes it.  It is now discontinued but he said that Curves is the same fragrance
B00850PGCY|5|Just LOVE this Soap and Glory line!  Love love the scent (original &#34;pink&#34; scent). It's heavenly.  Also have the body butter, body wash, body lotion, hand wash, body scrub, facial wash, hand cream, foot cream, and probably more!😂. I used the body butter one morning after using the body wash in the shower.  I had knee surgery that day.  When I went in for my surgery, all the nurses were ooooing and ahhhhhhing over how GOOD I smelled!  The pre- and post-op nurses were in LOVE with how I smelled!😊. This is great stuff.  Smells CLEAN.  Just showered clean.  Not like I just showered in a bottle of perfume.  REALLY wish this Soap and Glory line was still available at Target (although I did find ALOT of these S&G products in my local Sephora shop!😊👍). Cannot say enough great things about this stuff.  Would buy in a heartbeat.
B001AIN4D6|5|HAVE USED PAUL SEBASTIAN PRODUCTS SINCE EARLY 90'S.  HAVE TRIED OTHERS DURING THIS TIME ALSO COME BACK TO PAUL SEBASTIAN.  I LIKE THE FRAGRANCE AND THE WOMEN LOVE IT. IT DOESN'T FADE AWAY AS THE DAY GOES ON. THE AFTER SHAVE AND SPRAY COLOGNE DOESN'T TAKE MUCH AS THIS IS A QUALITY PRODUCT AND LAST A LONG TIME!!!!
B00WT9O128|4|I buy this for smell which is not always consistant but is still nice.
B004Y9GZRK|4|I use this lip balm instead of nude lipstick.<br />looks more natural, feels great, makes lips look full, but not greasy.<br />like this product.
B004MEVRQQ|5|I was cautious getting a self tanner as I had gotten some 8 years ago. I had bad luck with the old stuff. I had stained hands and unevenness(which was my lack of application skill). This stuff has great smell for several hours but even at its worst smell its not that bad. One thing I've learned is to wash your hands every time you apply, like every time you do a part of your body. Let's say you do your shoulder then wash hands with soap, dry hands then apply to your forearm and so on. Once I did my whole body then washed my hands then my hands were badly tanned. Also I apply then wait 4 hours then take a shower. This product has nice natural glowing tan(as long as you apply evenly). Also works as a good moisturizer. My skin is so flippin soft its awesome. Will be buying more.
B0030GSEWC|4|Pleasant fresh scent
B00ARF42H0|2|cheaply made
B0034KYDTM|2|I was excited to see this product. I saw SHANY had other items but I wanted to see the quality before ordering anything else. This was a disappointment! I took it out of the box and all the layers opened up and wouldn't stay shut. Not too thrilled about giving this as a gift to a granddaughter.
B00641UCY8|5|what can i say?? this product is AMAZING, wish it came in a gallon, otherwise it softened my weave very nicely and smelled delicious!
B000G6NOZG|5|VG
B00021VCVS|5|Great product.  I swim several hours a week and this works well to get rid of the chlorine smell.
B0082CKCJ2|5|Excellent Lotion & Seller
B003N3GDUM|5|This has been discontinued by Victoria's Secret and I've been searching everywhere. Places such as Ebay have been asking ridiculous prices. This one was priced right and arrived VERY quickly!!
B002ZQ9COM|2|I bought these for myself and my daughters because we travel often and it's nice to have some small brushes for different cosmetics.  Holy cow are these small!  I should have expected it.  If you look at the picture close enough, you can see that the metal band that holds the bristles is half of the brush!  Small can be ok.  I was just not prepared how small they really are.  Aside from that, I have found them frustrating to use with eyeshadows.  The bristles are stiff and I find it does a poor job of blending.  They are great for concealer application under the eyes though.  I also use them for eyeliner and as a lip brush when traveling.  I would not purchase them again.
B00BIJX0L8|4|Great product if you're not looking to cover gray hair
B000TFQMN0|5|I have used Almay products for years.  I like how they are pakaged, it is a quality color and it is easy to use, and a quality item
B004BCT7G6|5|[[VIDEOID:dd9355ab97e12d8411771d8d8c274081]] I spent what felt like an eternity feeling like Goldilocks while I was searching for that perfect mix between a nude and a pink lipstick. This ones too pink! Now this one is too nude! Then came the day that I cast my eyes on Loreal Fairest Nude and was finally able to breathe a sigh of relief and say \\"Now this one is JUUUUST RIGHT!\\"<br /><br />I love that it is non drying, doesn't cake up, and goes on super smooth. After getting home and trying it on, this instantly became my go-to daily lipstick. In preparation for any discontinuation, I have already stockpiled several tubes and hidden them away under super high tech security (OK, maybe no security if we're being honest here) and I highly suggest you do the same!
B00KVOKJ1A|5|I just love this product.  I got the polish in the mail earlier than advertised.  The colors are excellent.  The polish is extremely reactive in hot and cold temperatures and the colors are awesome.  I will definitely be buying more colors in the future.
B00545UP5Q|1|These did absolutely nothing for me. They were wet and goupy and I didn't see one good benefit from it. Save your money!
B003607ZNG|5|Been using this product for a while. I love it, swear by it, and recommend it for any guy and all types of skin. What I love most about this product is that it does not over dry your skin after using. Guys, if use this scrub with a konjac sponge......you will see a difference, and feel a difference in your skin.
B00H7Q05H8|1|niceshop offers a better wprking one for a dollar more. this was a replacement and it doesnt work for me at all
B00008BFXL|5|They are great,  I tried and off brand before and will never do it again.
B00070QF20|5|I switched from Proactiv to this product because I was curious after reading some of the reviews. And I am really glad I gave it a try. My skin has gotten even better with fewer breakouts and more even texture.
B00LVPDBA4|4|Super product for the price. Bought it for my vacation house as I have a better model at home and it is fantastic. Has the 2 minute brushing cycle but lacks the 30 sec buzzer that tells you to change brushing sector. Since I bought my home sonicare my dental checkups have been great.
B0020JN4BQ|2|I got it for my Mom that have circulation problems in her legs.<br /><br />The surprise was when we conected just the B air flow is working, so just one size inflate.
B000E7STGQ|5|I actually spent over $65 in the store on this fragrance and wish I would have found it on line first. this is a very pleasent and manly fragrance that will last all day with just one or two sprays.
B007SONBYI|1|These shears are very sharp but they arent For a professional i took them to work and they didnt even last me a month they broke right away and when i tried to exchange them the company couldnt do anything so i feel like the coatumer service sucked and i will NEVER order anything from them again so learn from me and dont waste your money.
B0086VI9TE|5|For me, it took two or three times to get used to the vibration of the brush on teeth. But no that I am used to it, I feel that my teeth are getting more clean using this rather than just a normal tooth brush.
B00BLVSZWW|1|It did not work!
B003TSJ5T2|5|Works and Helps dry skin. Have used it several years. It has improved the quality of my aging skin. Get the large size!
B001JKTTVQ|4|Great product. I really like the soft brushes. Amazing deal for all the brushes you receive. I am very happy with this purchase.
B00563K6VO|1|want to get a good glove to pretect my hand when using curing rod, see the good reviews and purchase this one, want to give it a try,  but the glove is way too small and thin, heat resistant? not sure, so I still use the glove come with curing rod, that one is thinker.
B006GTKSHY|5|I read the reviews of this product before opting to buy it and a lot of people gave it very positive comments. I wasn't disappointed when I got mine, actually I was really impressed. The lip colours are very bold and they last long. My sister used the blushes and immediately went to order a palette for herself. The eyeshadows are just awesome. Doesn't fall out or cake when used. I'm very pleased with the product
B00099Z2OQ|1|I am not Anthony I am his wife.  I have used this product for many years and was very pleased with it.<br /><br />I have very curly, coarse, dry hair.  As you may imagaine I was thrilled to find this leave in conditioner.<br /><br />Over the past 6 months I discovered that this product became Eco friendly and no longer hair friendly. I have no idea what they changed but it is no longer something I can use.<br /><br />I wish that when a product is good they would simply leave it alone.  When I began using the older formula my hair was shiny, soft and managable.  With the current product my hair acts as though I left a big glob of conditioner in it, it is dull and very sticky.  Getting a comb through it is impossible.
B00FY42K7S|5|Pleasant smell, not sticky , works very well
B005GQLSAO|3|Not by much but this product is cheaper at Trilastin.com, at least today it is. Just thought y'all would like to know. :)
B002C8ZX9Q|5|Worth every penny!  And this was pennies on the dollar compared to retail price!
B00K41PQL8|5|Thought I had diabetes when my toe turned black. What was really the problem was my toe's skin flap was blocking it's blood supply & killing the skin. Separating the toes gave the blood supply it needed and eventually the skin grew back.  Me Happy!
B00GM4G5ZM|5|Switched out the head of this for the more conventional round brush, which I prefer. Other than that, it's a winner & affordable.
B000H5JIYM|4|This is a high quality face shield--the flexible barrier is fairly thick and I am confident nothing will get through it.  The hard storage case is a plus--I have this attached to my wilderness first aid pouch so I like that it's a little more durable in case it gets thrown around.  Great product.
B0009R35GA|5|Ever since our local Beauty Supply House closed down I've been having trouble finding this particular strength of hair bleach. It's been a real pain. I was so shocked and happy when I decided to check on good old Amazon and saw it was available thru them and at a fair price. As usual with Prime, I received it in 2 days, no shipping costs. I love you Amazon!
B001DNE3KQ|5|This item was purchased for a nineties-something man who knows shaving.  He uses the shaver everyday and just loves it.  We haven't heard any complaints from his wife either!
B000TCXWR2|5|I bought this toenail clipper for my husband. Personally I never like these type of clippers, but this is the best! I works like no other.  My husband has nails of stone and he said it make it so easy.  I highly recommend this item.
B003V3476G|5|I have tried several different electric razors including earlier Norelco models, Braun, and others.  None have provided the closeness and non-irritating shave this latest model has.  Excellent product!
B0055ERUC2|5|Great vitamin. I loved this supplement so much that I purchased a bottle for my best friend. Like all wellness supplements results are not instantaneous so a great deal of patience is required. As some of the other reviewers have mentioned you will notice a slight color change and a difference in smell in your urine. Don't be alarmed - it's a sign that your body is digesting the vitamin. If you're on the fence about this purchase, I'd encourage you to try it. I think you will begin to see the quickest results in the strength and the length of your nails.
B00N4E7EA8|5|best dry shampoo on the market!
B001CS8BJQ|4|I years ago stopped trying to maintain the illusion that I was not going bald by coming over hair from the sides, nose, back, ears, eyelashes, etc.  And with that, I stopped spending the money on haircuts, replacing them with an endless supply of disposable razors and a Remington Rotary Razor that I got several years ago.<br /><br />The truth is that using a regular razor on my head is slow and tedious.  Not only do you have to be careful about not cutting yourself (which I've done on far too many occasions), but you can spend ten or twenty minutes going over every bit only to find an hour later you've got a little island of hairs on one corner of your head that you're convinced everyone spots immediately.  And if you happen to go a day or two without shaving it, you're faced with the whole ordeal all over again.<br /><br />I had a relatively ancient three head Remington razor that was relatively useless. The shaver's power was weak off battery and the cord it was attached to was not long enough or tight enough to enable me to shave without essentially hugging a wall.  I finally started my quest to find a decent alternative.<br /><br />The Panasonic ES-SA40-K Pro Curve Wet/Dry Shaver is the perfect combination of performance and low cost.  After reading reviews for several much more expensive razors, I found this one on Amazon and decided to bite the bullet.  It has been a worthwhile purchase.  Unlike my old rotary razor, I get a lot of coverage on the razor's foil with which to run the razor over my head.  This means that I can shave my head more quickly and confidently.  As an added bonus, it works well wet or dry.  The razor is light enough and well contoured enough that I can easily hold it without is falling in the shower.  Its controls are simple and the razor foil gently glides over my head and face and provides an adequate shave for daily maintenance of my head, and for a decent enough facial appearance for the weekends.  While it isn't as close or clean as a regular razor, it is perfect for my head.<br /><br />Note:  This razor charges by being snapped directly into a wall transformer, so if your bathroom plug is not oriented with one plug under another or is in a tight spot, you may not be able to use this razor.<br /><br />PROS<br /><br />Good performance on a budget<br />Works well on the scalp<br />Great for everyday use.<br />Holds a charge for several days.<br />Cheaper than a few months of razor blades.<br />Wall transformer/charger keeps razor off of counter.<br />Comfortable and easy to hold.<br /><br />CONS<br /><br />Long charge time (8 hours)<br />Essentially disposable since repairing and replacing blade/foil is expensive.<br />Wall transformer/charger needs more space than other razors<br />Not as close as a blade.fect for my head.    Note:  This razor charges by being snapped directly into a wall transformer, so if your bathroom plug is not oriented with one plug under another or is in a tight spot, you may not be able to use this razor.    PROS    Good performance on a budget  Works well on the scalp  Great for everyday use.    Holds a charge for several days.    Cheaper than a few months of razor blades.    Wall transformer/charger keeps razor off of counter.    Comfortable and easy to hold.   CONS   Long charge time (8 hours)  Essentially disposable since repairing and replacing blade/foil is expensive.    Wall transformer/charger needs more space than other razors   Not as close as a blade.
B00UHS7CGU|5|It's good
B00FBEXPLG|5|I am a makeup LOVER, so I jumped at the chance to purchase this liner at a discount in exchange for my honest review.  All of the opinions in this review are one hundred percent my own and in no way have they been fed to me by someone else.<br />I purchased the pencil in dark brown and the color is exactly what I expected.  A true brown, more cool than warm, and not so dark that it reads as black.  A great shade.<br />The liner smooths on nicely, doesn't tug at the eyelid or require too much pressure.  And it smudges nicely as well.  Very little work needed to get the look I was going for.<br />The liner stays put. I wore it to a barbecue yesterday and through the humidity and a bit of rain, it did not budge.  The color stayed true and nothing was running or fading out.<br />I have worn it a couple times now and I just love it.  I have pretty sensitive skin and have not had any kind of reaction to the formula so all in all this is a win for me.  I really like this line!
B003UCXVBU|5|My sister had this on her Christmas list.  I had not heard of it but she swears by it.  It was a much better price than in the store.
B004O2KPRI|5|I have found nothing better than this to clear up dark spots/marks from my face in such little time. It worked so well for me that I can now feel confident enough to go a day without make up. My skin looks great!
B001EM8MNA|5|Exactly what I needed.
B00HDZGF4K|5|I've been using this a little over a week along with the Hyaluronic Acid serum from J&K as well. So far I have noticed that my skin is a lot smoother, a lot softer and looks very healthy. I was not expecting to notice any difference so quickly. I use them once a day, at night.<br />I was my face first, then I use the Hyaluronic Acid Serum. I use probably three large drops to cover my entire face and neck. I let it soak in for about five to ten minutes and then I use the Vitamin C Serum after. I let that soak in for about five to ten minutes as well and follow with a moisturizer.<br />The biggest change I have noticed to far is on my forehead. I have very dry skin on my forehead that flakes and peels off as if it is sunburned. I have tried many different things to help. These two products together have made that difference. My skin is no longer flaking and peeling. I'm truly amazed!<br />The last thing I have noticed is the difference in the &#34;tomahawk&#34; mark between my brows. I'm not sure what other people call it, but it's two deep lines running vertically between your brows that is more noticeable when you furrow your brows. As I have gotten older then have gotten worse. Now that I have started using these products I have noticed the lines have gotten less deep. I think this has to do with the hydration from these serums plumping my skin back up.<br />If you have been on the fence about trying this out, you should. Along with the Hyaluronic Acid serum. I'm amazed by my results from just a week and am very excited to see more as I continue the use.
B00DXF8E34|2|Holds five bottles.
B00FZJNR3S|2|Contours nicely but the bristles end up all over my face. The brush was featured in InStyle but I think this one must be a knock off, I cant imagine that they would recommend a brush that sheds.
B00712NR0A|5|Bought this for myself and I love it. I will no longer put regular foundation on my face. It leaves my skin feeling light. The colors are wonderful and I mix and match to find my skin tone. The machine is sturdy and isn't too loud. Would recommend.
B00BQ1Z9F8|1|They come apart every time you take it off the unit, and the metal pieces on the inside, near the base, instantly started to rust.  The original brushes that came with the kit were fine, but the replacements are junk.  They also fit so tight on the handle that you can barely get them off.
B007FXZZWI|5|I'm really pleased with the Jungleman Deodorant. I've tried virtually every other natural deodorant on the market and this is the only product that has worked for me. I recommend buying several of these at a time - as other reviewers have noted, the shipping is a bit pricey (my deodorant sticks arrived in a foil-type package inside of a box, most likely because the product is heat sensitive).
B002Z7FV3C|5|Wonderful perfume!
B00433RJ7W|5|I absolutely love this pencil in the Silk shade because it's the perfect light pink. It's a blue based hue so it makes teeth appear whiter. Since Urban Decay hasn't come out with a similar shade (I love Urban Decay lip liners because of their staying power), I apply Urban Decay's clear lip liner in Ozone over the Prestige Classic Lip Pencil in Silk and it lasts for hours. I hope & pray they never discontinue this product in this shade. Highly recommend for light pink lovers. It is not frosty so you won't look like you belong in the 80's era. It's just the right color...
B003TSJ5T2|5|This is smooth, healing cream. I use it daily for myself. In addition, I use it on one of my dogs who has exposed healed skin from being burned by someone before she was rescued.
B00ESNF2NA|5|This oil worked very well for the arthritis in my moms hand
B00F89U5NK|5|I got it for my son and he absolutely loves it.
B00I2NZEBC|5|Great product!
B00PQSE25K|4|I do believe that this product has helped reduce the dark circles under my eyes. The price point is reasonable, and it's lasted quite a while. I'd try it for sure, especially if everything you've tried at the grocery store has not been helpful.
B00112HROS|5|Very beautiful<br />Excellent company
B002201F4G|5|Ok
B00BWRLJ6O|4|Pretty good shaver.  Like the self cleaning feature.
B006GYGBRK|5|You can't find this in stores anymore.  But it is a great product....goes on easily.....and has a beautiful shine which last.  It looks good with one coat.
B008VT09ZS|4|We love this cream.  Actually, the most ideal cream we've found is mixing this cream with Aveeno diaper cream... magic!
B000H7O5M0|2|The cut is so close it tears my skin up. I took it to a barber who said it can't be adjusted. They are unusable.
B00005V5OW|4|This mascara is perfect for daytime. It never clumps until it's old and time to throw out. I like that it's really washable.
B00BIT9DW8|5|When this soap arrived in the mail I was beyond excited! I've been using the Route One lotion for awhile and absolutely love it. I have not been disappointed by the soap, it completely lives up to my expectations. Feels great. Smells great. I even have caught my husband using it!!
B00008LUQ0|5|with nitro being as sensitive to air and moisture as it is, this little holder fits the nitro bottle right inside so you don't have to open it to have a handy carrier.  YES
B00FZMFTD6|1|Too small, waste of money.
B00CJ3AAP6|5|These stickers are amazing. They are super easy to apply, are mess-free and they last much longer than regular stickers.
B000I20Q72|5|I'll be ordering more for my friends.    As a person with a shoulder injury, it has been difficult for me to comb my hair and clean my back.  This product has alleviated at least one of those problems.
B0009YDOIM|5|This is a wonderful, almost unscented man-sized soap bar.  My son-in-law had one like this which I used during a month-long visit and was using up.  I am so happy Amazon carries it!  It is well worth the money.
B00QPGFWRY|3|Good product , I would buy it again
B0009WMRD2|5|It is what I ordered. I'll order it again!
B00HMW0NR4|4|Nice thin silky, real looking hair. But they sent me the wrong color. Just make sure you pay attention to that.
B00V6ZLQ06|5|I use these roll on bottles for blends with EO ....the price is great with fast ship time.
B000E7STLQ|5|Love it. Not a knock off. Smells great
B00IN47ZVC|5|votive size candle with lots of scent.  My mom will love it.
B00H2WIKCE|5|It is a very important product for my wellbeing.
B000143C0K|1|I bought this in December and just used it for the first time . The machine pulled my hair after i oiled it and went to give myself a haircut . Felt like it wanted to pull the brain out of my head . Sorry i din't use it earlier as now i'm out 50$ .
B00409O3RI|5|It was amazing and very effective but you need the tool to break up the glue.
B003UKM9CO|5|Excellent power brush. Really deep cleans, and works great.  I've been using electric tooth brushes for the past 20 years.<br />This is the best one so far and at $50.00 makes it just about perfect.  Use as directed and you'll never have cavities. You will have beautiful sparkling, perfectly cleaned teeth'.... Highly recommend'
B00HMIOALI|5|Love the fragrance and the gentle clean I get without the extra ingredients!
B00IT1ECBA|5|Excellent product! Mild smell and pumps out just enough so you don't waste it.
B00IMTV1FE|5|When Bananana Boat first came out with this product, I gave it a try and was instantly hooked. I use it as my everyday face and other sun-exposed skin lotion in the mid-Atlantic region from mid-April through mid-September on my type-2 skin which has already gathered a couple of pre-cancerous spots.<br />The texture is easy to smooth on, relatively quick to sink in, the smell is &#34;green and leafy&#34;, it takes forever to wash off your hands after applying, so you know it's going to stick around for awhile.
B0007X74E0|4|I often use Redken as a heat protectant when straightening my relaxed hair. works well, recommend not being heavy handed as it might leave the hair weighed down. less is more and it does leave my hair feeling soft and silky.
B00B1ZI2HQ|1|took too long to get it
B00G6SYUP6|4|First I would like to say that the packaging that this product comes in is great. The bottle allows you to get every bit of the product out of the container. The product itself is also really nice. The pump on the bottle gives you more then you need for both eyes so half a pump would probably do you just fine. The fragrance of this product is pleasant, but not overpowering and the constancy of the cream perfect. Not to watery or to thick. So far I would have to say that I'm happy with my purchase.
B009WLXABE|5|I love this item.  I use it for makeup remover and for my toner. It's perfect!! love it.<br />Packaged and arrived prefect/
B005GRNIP6|5|they fit perfect
B006R1LBJA|2|Can't even tell the difference,I will not buy it again
B00N40O2PM|5|great
B00DSLFNQ4|5|Great product
B007LQ3GES|5|Great product
B00CFCSOR2|2|My fiance and I got this thinking it might be fun. We got it pretty quickly from the sender, but the product wasn't worth what we paid for it. The directions clearly stated that the molding mixture should be stirred for 60 seconds and would remain the texture of pancake batter...however, I followed directions exactly and before I could even begin stirring, it was hardened too much. He couldn't even get it in the molding mixture! It was a huge mess. May give it another try as the one I got could have been faulty, but I'm not happy about the wasted money!
B006GQPZ8E|3|i love the Revlon Lip Butters, thought they would all be<br />similar, but obviously they are different, not only in color.<br />Peach Parfait is a nice fresh color especially for spring,<br />but has too much glitter for my taste.<br />It does´nt feel as smooth as the other ones, like Pink Truffle<br />or Red Velvet or Lollipop.<br />i would´t  buy again, not this one
B001ELA25M|5|eliminates some lines altogether if used for 2 or 3 days and really lightens deep lines so they are much less noticeable.<br />I found that  if I use  for a couple of  nights and sleep in it I don't need to use it again for a few days, if I use it again before the lines get deep they seem to stay gone...I had run out when I bought this time, and even after about 3 weeks the lines were not as deep as they were before I used it the first time .
B003I0MHEG|2|Didn't work on brown spots
B00F3FNY8M|5|I cleverly disguised this beard balm as a Christmas present for my boyfriend and his unruly facial hair.  Every throne needs a cushion, and every cushion needs to be maintained.  This stuff turned a straw-filled burlap sack into a satin pillow, and I think I need to go take a seat now!
B00CQ7ZAK0|5|I love it.  The smell is fabulous and it practically detangles your hair itself!
B004TSFE28|5|These brushes are labeled and easy to use. There is enough space for more brushes in the holder too.<br /><br />I'm especially happy with the eye brow brush. My eye brows look more natural than ever.
B007VDUKT0|4|I am a musican / performer in my mid 40s and I have to be super conscious of my age / appearance. Therefore as opposed to most men, I try these types of products as well as laser facials etc.. I suffer from very minor redness as I am part Irish. I often get told I look like I'm in my late 20s or early 30s. However, I do have minor skin flaws especially in the last 5 years.<br /><br />I've been using the product for several days now and I can certainly tell you that I've noticed an improvement in the redness and an overall tightening of my skin (especially around my jaw line). I'll certainly be reordering if not going on the monthly plan thingy they offer.<br /><br />I can't use MOST products like this because they cause even more irritation / redness. Nerium has not done that so far and produced some results just in a few days. I'm excited to see how everything looks in a few weeks.  I do suggest taking before and after pictures because that would be a the best way to judge for yourself.<br /><br />I don't know what's up with the negative reviews.. competition perhaps or whatever but I really don't care as long as they continue to offer the product.<br /><br />I'm a real person writing a real review. So, I'd say this product, for me.. has been a winner.. so far.
B00A8WQKAO|2|One of my colors was broke when received. Two pallets were the exact same so i really only got 32 different colors
B0084FFOAO|5|Perfect scent to go with the perfume, it is long lasting and priced well. I will never purchase another scent besides for Victoria Secrets Love is Heavenly perfume. I love both scents and so does my husband!!!
B005Z8H3WK|5|I LOVE THE LIP GLOSS - but there is NO way in hell I'm paying that much for it.  They should have never discontinued this
B006F5TD3Y|5|great clippers
B00336EUTK|1|Not very helpful
B00E4MR558|5|Best toothpaste ever!
B00025G04I|5|there is no day without this product on my face ..summer and winter  i use it both lso day and night:)
B004M7WKKK|3|I ordered this last week and was so excited for it to arrive. I am a cosmetology student so I need this to practice on my make up routine. It finally came in the mail today, but when I opened it some of the colors had melted on to the top of the lid. I would suggest that the companies put a label stating that the contents in the package can melt so they should keep some kind of air conditioning on it. Other than that its GREAT!!
B0016D4RQS|5|This is the most outstanding incense you will buy, ANYWHERE, and Amazon sells it for the best price.  Long burning (usually about an hour), clean smelling (never smells \\"burned\\" like some cheap incense does).  Bought this 6-pack to try out the Red that I read great reviews on.  Love that and have also burned a Black so far and love that too.  I suspect I will be quite satisfied with all 6.  Stay with this particular brand of Nag Champa though as others just are not as pure smelling.
B000Y1DTRG|1|Package was open upon arrival.
B000FBZLHG|5|Works great and smells nice. Not to much scent.
B002AQWK00|5|It fits my blow dryer perfectly and distribute the air uniform...I really like the result in my curly hair after using it
B00AZQXIE4|4|Got an excellent peel from this solution.  The brush is not of the greatest quality so I tossed it.  The cream feels good.
B00FEJ7O88|5|I bought this for my husband. He loves it. It was just the right gift for the holiday season this year.
B006N0BW76|5|Love this glitter. Saw it on pinterest and had to have it! So glad I bought this, and you will be too!
B00B868SK4|5|Fun images exactly as advertised. Arrived promptly. These are so easy to use and lots of fun. I might order more.
B004DPBPK2|4|I like this conditioner, but i've recently made the decision to move away from silicone-based products and because of that I haven't purchased this in a long time. This conditioner is very moisturizing for my hair, which is often very dry. I think it is good for curly hair. I only wish this came in a larger container, with a pump.
B005IXAC1Q|4|I love the studs! They're just the size I like. They are kind of small for working with, but the result is adorable dainty designs. The case is a bit annoying, though--the pieces end up stuck to the top with static. Sometimes the dividers brush the pieces back into their places when turning the top, but sometimes they fit through a small space between the divider and the top of the case and end up falling into a different section.<br /><br />Still, for the price, can't really complain!
B00T72RTQK|4|This isn't your father's Irish Spring soap. The new Hydrating Body Wash is made for men who would like to preserve healthy looking skin. It has shea butter extract so that skin does not overdry, as it would with cheaper options. It also smells delicious. My one complaint is that the scent, fresh and clean like saltwater air, doesn't last long. Overall, I am quite satisfied with the quality of this body wash. 4/5 stars.
B000EVGQ8U|5|I prefer this top coat over seche vite because it is thinner and last longer since it does not get unusably thick after a few months.  It dries just a TAD bit slower than seche and is a TAD less shinier but it's worth it. Also has less chemicals.
B000GOIJWG|5|The wheelchair meets all my needs and so easy to use. I am a small person and it fits well. My husband said it was very easy to put foot rests on and off when  taking apart to store and putting together to use.
B001E6O9M4|5|The smell of this shampoo is fantastic.  The wife really loves it and it's not to terrible for me.  It leave our hair feeling clean and I have less dandruff issues then with some natural shampoos.
B007O7DFX6|3|I love this color!  The only downside is that it can make you look a little too greasy/orange-ish towards the end of the day, so less is definitely more!
B001E6OERO|5|I wouldn't use any other wax but Nair, and online product is as expected too.. I will keep buying this product.
B001VEK1HQ|5|Great item great price for replacement blades
B005I455PS|1|I purchased this bath bomb with high hopes of a relaxing spa like experience. I found this to be just too messy.  It was like disolved almond macaroons. It left a layer of ground nuts and coconut all over me and my tub. It had very little sent and was not as moisturizing as I hoped. The ball did not foam and dissintegrated in seconds. Oh well, back to my old favorite; Hugo bath balls.
B000Z61TX6|5|Really thick and creamy mascara without being clumpy. It's also easy to remove without sticking to lashes. Looks very natural.
B001ET77TI|5|perfect i highly recommend it<br /><br />but dont use it every day if you have a dark hair it will turn orange
B001172A5Y|4|Left very little stubble. No ingrown hairs, no bumps, no alergies! My only rant is that The batteries didn't last very long, I have to change them every 5 days or so.
B000NWOEN4|1|could not set time all buttons are black small and close together got the watch for someone who can barely see and it didnt work right out of the box
B002LM3VM4|5|This shampoo does not have any of the usual shampoo ingredients that my husband is allergic to. Would highly recommend to anyone allergic to quaternium and polyquaternium.
B0017ZECA6|3|Forget about shaving your head with these blades. They simply aren't designed for that kind of application. Fortunately I can use them on my face, however, I can only get a single shave out of one blade. I use one edge for the first pass and I use the other edge for a final pass to get a close shave. Then I throw the blade away. I guess that's an ok deal.
B001OOB6K4|5|I wanted to stock up because Jergens isn't making soft Shimmer anymore. I wanted a shimmer without a bunch of perfume and without a bronzer.  I've used this for many years. Looks nice on legs in summer.
B005KS40OE|4|this bar does not break me out, nor does it seem to magically clear up acne. its a basic bar that sometimes feels &#34;hot&#34; (no other way to describe it) when i leave it on for too long so maybe not for those with very sensitive skin. it minimizes my pores immediately after use, but since it does not leave skin moist (but not nearly as drying as most washes or bars ive used) it seems to contribute to oil production. all in all my skin seems a little more red with continued use of this, but also fairly clearer. its hard to know what i think of this bar but right now with my very picky skin, ive used up almost the whole bar and i would repurchase. the smell is only strong the first few uses, and its not very offensive and does not linger very long at all. i'll eventually update this.
B005P0T4I4|5|Like it a lot, no smell of it,like it
B00KWP3SA2|3|The reason I say this product is OK is because I was not unhappy with the Cetaphil cleanser I used before.  OZ Naturals Facial Cleanser lathers beautifully and cleanses even my eye makeup.  The only negative is that it irritates my eyes at times.  The results are excellent, but the slight irritation of my eyes bothers me.  I don't know if I will continue to use this.
B007822QDM|5|Absolutely pleased with your product. Thank you. The clear nail polish works great over every color. It goes on smooth and has a shiny finished look.
B00016QXR2|4|CS Be Gone Gave me a bunch to hand out and try. Every person I gave these to loved them and said it works great. If you bite your lips or get sores on the inside of your mouth these are great to have around. Within a few days your feeling better and the pain is gone and its healing. They can be caused from just about anything. Stress to dental work. I have a wedding coming up I am making sure this is in my bag just in case for me or the girls. The application is easy and made with natural ingredients. I liked these over others ive tried. Smells better, tastes isn't bad, and works faster! Company ships fast and has wonderful CS
B002I5IZNY|4|I'm comparing this product mostly to Art of Shaving pre-shave oil.<br /><br />This product, to me, is more expensive but just about the same quality as AOS oil.<br /><br />I like this product but I do not like the price, because I get the same result from AOS oil and it costs less.  Some other remarks ....<br /><br />******************************** SPECIAL NOTE AND UPDATE*************<br /><br />I am still enjoying my test-drive of this oil and I must note that it has turned to my default oil instead of AOS, just because I have it.  But most importantly, I had an incident.  It has been noted below that the AOS shaving oil bottle is glass, which is kind of classy I thought.  The bottle of Truefitt & Hill oil is a clear polymer.  I knocked the bottle off of the bathroom shelf onto the hard tile floor of the bathroom.  The bottle was almost full.  I went into mild cardiac arrest for a moment and then the bottle harmlessly bounced around, because it is made of a durable polymer.  I believe this is better than the AOS glass bottle now, after having that experience.<br /><br />Let me also add this product advertises that it will not \\"gunk\\" up your razor (I use a long-handled Merker D/E razor.)  This is not true.  This oil will gunk up your razor just as much as the AOS oil gunks up your razor.  I am willing to live with the fact that pre-shave oils have a tendency to clog the razor and all you need to do is be a little more diligent about rinsing your razor when shaving so not a big deal, but it is a big deal because their advertisement about no \\"gunk\\" is false.  It clogs just as much as AOS pre-shave oil.<br /><br />It also has a fruity citrus smell.  I generally don't like fruity smells that much and although it is kind of pleasant, I will not that this is advertised as \\"unscented.\\"  AOS oil has no odor.  AOS oil also seems to penetrate the skin better.  I am not a salesman for AOS (I don't use their shaving cream - I use Truehill & Fitt Ultimate Comfort Shaving cream - and I would recommend that shaving cream as the best) - this is just my experience comparing the pre-shave oils.<br /><br />I do like the little bottle, even though it is some kind of polymer and not glass, like the AOS bottle.<br /><br />Update:  I am getting to like the citrus smell, which fades quickly.<br /><br />Also, you really don't need shaving cream with this oil or AOS oil, as I have discovered when time is of the essencce.- and I would recommend that shaving cream as the best) - this is just my experience comparing the pre-shave oils.<br /><br />I do like the little bottle, even though it is some kind of polymer and not glass, like the AOS bottle.<br /><br />Update:  I am getting to like the citrus smell, which fades quickly.<br /><br />Also, you really don't need shaving cream with this oil or AOS oil, as I have discovered when time is of the essencce.
B006AR6DYY|5|We needed cotton balls we could put in our honey bee hives, these fit the requirements just fine.
B00336EUTK|1|I thought I'd be smart and save a few bucks, so I ordered the Crest 3D Whitestrips from Amazon. These things should have an expiration date them! When I attempted to pull the strips off of the plastic backing the backing part that was against the strips came off with the strips, making it very difficult to separate them. It's as if the whitening magic had turned to glue. Won't be buying these from Amazon in the future!
B00147FGJ8|5|Love it! Made tanning in the sun so much easier.
B0012317DS|5|I've used the Clinique brow pencil and powders and the Kevyn Aucoin ones the most. Like those. BUT THIS..I find myself reaching for this one more and more and my more expensive ones are being ignored.<br /><br />Hey, if cheap works, why pay 4 times the amount?<br /><br />I have almost black hair and nearly black eyebrows and lashes (I'm Latina, mixed race). My skin is MAC NC42 to 44. I give you these base color measures so when I say Dark Brown works beautifully and \\"naturally\\" for me, you see what I mean. It's not black...it's a very dark brown that isn't so harsh as to look weird.<br /><br />This one doesn't do as fine a line as some others, but I dont' have bushy eyebrows. Menopause and thyroid problems thinned out my eyebrows. I just use it to fill in the \\"blanks\\" >:). Works great. I have two and am ordering two more for back-up (I like one in my purse and one in the house.) I hardly ever need a touch-up.<br /><br />I will add that the gel is nice for those who have unruly and bushier type eyebrows. I don't use it. I tried it at first and got breakouts in my eyebrow line. If you have supersensitive skin, beware that. I used to use clear mascara when I was younger to do to my (then bushier) eyebrows what this does now. It's still a great idea for \\"setting\\" unruly brows. If you don't need that, skip it. (What I will use now and then is MAC's brow wax, which doesn't irritate my allergic skin but will slightly tame stray, oddly-angled eyebrow hairs).<br /><br />But the 5 stars is for the pencil part and (if you have tolerant skin) the gel is good, too.<br /><br />Hope they don't discontinue this. Seems when I find a cheaper product I like, it goes buy-bye in a year...
B001UO99VG|4|I bought these for my 9-year-old granddaughter who is not a &#34;girly-girl&#34; but likes to keep her hair out of her face, especially when playing soccer.  She really liked these!!  The price was great.  They aren't as &#34;sturdy&#34; as the metal barrettes she has but  good for the price.
B005JHJUI2|5|best carmex lip balm they make. hard to find in stores. a little overpriced for what you can buy it for at retailers
B003983I1S|1|The worst quality of Fusion Proglide blades I have ever used, they start scratching the skin after 2-3 use. I have been using Fusion Proglide blades for two years and always very satisfied with them, they last for 15+ shaves. This is the first time I hated it.<br />I know there are lot of cheap/fake Gillette Fusion blades sold on amazon by third parties but I bought this because it was being sold by Amazon and I trust Amazon. From now on I will stick to local stores for blades.<br />For the first time I am disappointed by any product sold by Amazon (not Gillette as I have used this line of product for long time).
B00AGG3MUI|5|Delivered as promised, excellent blade very sharp works well with my beard and skin type in my DE89L and my feather popular razors. would buy again.
B002TSA91Q|5|I was using the blue Dove body wash for men... can't remember the name of it. This stuff is pretty good too. It isn't as in-your-face smelling as those other guys like Axe and Old Spice. This is a body wash for grown men who don't want to smell like they came out of a club. Good stuff and very moisturizing. My skin is so soft now
B00AHF1GTM|5|These are great disposable razors. They give a clean shave, and are very comfortable to use. The lubricant is not sticky or bothersome at all. It washes away quickly and cleanly and definitely is helpful in shaving. I would recommend these razors to others.
B007RF2GQM|5|I really liked the three dark colors in the Orly Dark Shadows collection.  I never intended to get this one though.  I ended up buying it when I found it on sale and I'm so glad I did!  It's a really pretty, lady-like pale pink, which is perfect for summer.  Orly is a good quality nail polish and this one is no exception.  I put on two coats, which dried quickly and had a shine without a top coat.  I can't wait to use this one again!
B00EOR8Z4S|4|Thanks
B003E7UNE4|5|I love the Eco Styler Olive Oil Gel, I cant never get to much of it.<br /><br />Leave your curls define and soft, doesnt leave my curls crunchy or greasy. Its the BEST gel I have try in my life, plus it has a soft smell that is really good too.<br /><br />It is my second jar, and for sure no the last.<br /><br />What works for me may not work for you, but you can give it a try!<br />Ps. I havy curly coily short afro. Maybe 4 a-b
B00CTHQ9TI|5|I highly recommend it! Amazing results.
B0002JHI1I|5|Once I started using this cleanser, I don't want anything else on my face.
B004C75FS4|3|i thought I was buying the larger container and when I went to order the larger one the provider was out of this product.
B00KPDLWFO|5|This is a great buy for my ab activities
B004JLEGM4|4|Smells great and leaves body soft and smooth
B0069SQVK0|5|Purchased to use in a diffuser.  It is very effective.  The oil is pure and does not gum it up.
B0088P2RVE|5|Great price great product, introduced at my salon, but like your prices much better!
B001FYV0HM|5|love how this makes my hair feel, and that it doesn't have all the chemicals in it
B001V9QSW8|3|Bought this hip kit to use at home after hip replacement surgery.  Have only used the grabber tool and shoehorn, have had help at home for putting stockings and socks on, so haven't tried those products. The grabber is ok, but not particularly strong.  It works well for getting dressed and picking up light objects. I purchased a larger, stronger grabber with a different mechanism to also use.
B007BQO6YM|4|Pros:<br />Size of the hand mirror is good enough to view the whole back of your head.<br />The plastic around the mirror does not feel cheap and the mirror is made out of real glass.<br />Very beautiful design.<br /><br />Cons:<br />The handle is terrible
B00BZ1QN2C|5|This is the best mask I've ever applied. I couldn't believe how soft my skin felt, and how quickly it removed blackheads. I mean, my skin is SO SOFT.<br />That being said, I absolutely hate how it feels on my face. When you give it any friction whatsoever, it begins to actually feel hot. I know some people like how that feels, but I think it's weird and uncomfortable.<br />However, the results are so amazing that I would still highly recommend this product, and I intend to keep using and buying it for myself.
B005X2F7KI|5|I ordered these striping paints on May 8th.They came today,May 12th.The packing was very good ,a box within a box ,within a box.All 24 bottles were clean ,no dried paint on any bottles.No broken bottles at all. Only one bottle was a little tough to open. I  gave it to my son ,he opened it No problem. That one bottle was a glitter paint ,there was a little paint built up around the neck of the bottle .It was very full ,so I used some .I did not received any double paints like some reviews  mentioned.There are two reds ,they do look the same in the bottles,but on paper or a nail you are able to see a difference.I received 5 bottles that are the glitter paints.One an emerald green,one gold,one silver,one is a deep grape wine color ,and one is a beautiful cobalt,navy blue.I got 4 different shades of pink ,very different shades of pink.3 very different shades of yellow.A deep pearl navy blue ,a bright white,an orange that to me is a few shades deeper then a very ripe melon.a beautiful sky blue.And I think maybe my favorite,a periwinkle,soft lavender shade.There is also your basic black, a pearl deep purple,a pearl lime green,plus a very dark hunter green,and a dark charcoal grey.They came standing in a plastic tray so each does fit snugly in the tray without falling over.The tray isn't heavy duty ,but it serves the purpose well.I held the tray sideways with the paint bottles and they did not fall out ,not one.I opened each bottle and ran a stripe along a sheet of white paper and an artificial nail and the paints are a nice consistency,not really thick but flows well for any striping needs.The  5 glitter paints are more transparent in color to show the glitter ,but they are not clear,just sheer clean color to complement the matching glitter.The paints did not dry flat.There is a little shine to the colors .And drum roll,very little if any odor,which is important to me because I paint my granddaughters' nails often.I'm really sorry for those who were unhappy with this product ,I myself am a very happy customer.The colors are bright and very pretty .These paints that I received definitely deserve the 5***** I gave them.Thank you for reading .  SMILES.uct ,I myself am a very happy customer.The colors are bright and very pretty .These paints that I received definitely deserve the 5***** I gave them.Thank you for reading .  SMILES.
B00JKUJGWO|5|Work amazing and came really quick!
B004A6XLWO|5|This is the third (or fourth time that I have bought this item.
B00E99JWQ6|1|Ok
B000052Y9Z|5|End tuft brushes are used to brush areas where regular size toothbrushes cannot reach or can reach only partially.  The brush was originally recommended to me by my dental hygienist and I have been using them for over 20 years.  The only problem I have run into with them is being unable to find them in drug stores when I needed to buy a new one.  With their availability on-line I no longer have that problem.
B00G0Q5V0M|5|Love it!
B00B65NASW|4|Mine came in today!!! So I immediately had to try them out!  Application is easy and it's such a fun concept.  Now aligning them isn't easy!  It's too bad they couldn't have a cut/paste chart on backside. I got my right eyeliner perfect but apparently cut left eye wrong leaving a tiny gap between lash line and tattoo... I just filled it in with liner. Since this is just for fun for me anyways... Could never wear for professional work. But at 3.50 it was a fun purchase!  I'm including a pic of the good eye on first application!  I cut the shape out so I could rest the tattoo against my lash line.<br /><br />EDIT*  I've had these for awhile and have learned some tricks along the way.  TAKE YOUR TIME APPLYING!!<br />1) Make sure your eyelid is clean and DRY before application.<br />2) I personally cut the the tattoos from the inner eye, lashline to the wing so that it fits more comfortable on my lid for application.<br />3) Once cut I put them on my eye reversed (sticky/tattooed side facing out) and see how the look/align.<br />4) When ready to apply I place against my eye and as close to lashline and corner of eye.  I use a damp cottonball and I don't rub the backing, I let the cotton ball sit and soak through than move it to soak through and till backing is completely moistened (The paper should stick to your eye on its own when fully wet and ready to be removed - you can gently lift part of paper if you are cautious and want to make sure tattoo is in place.)<br />5) Once its set and backing is off, keep your eyes closed!! **THIS IS IMPORTANT!!** Let the tattoo fully dry so as to avoid cracking and flaking.  Dependent on your genetics and eye composition, this may happen anyways.  (oily skin, puffy eyes, etc).<br />6) Add final touches, more eyeliner to define or fill in gaps, mascara, colored liner on water liner.  HAVE FUN!
B004Z209HS|5|I absolutely love this oil. I came across organic argan oil about a month ago and have been truly impressed with this product. My skin looks younger, I mean the wrinkles are noticeably gone and my skin feels softer. I have used a certain moisturizing cream for years, I'm talking 20 years or more, and as of this oil I'll no longer be using the cream. I highly recommend this argan oil.
B004HC5YDU|5|Hey,    I decided to write a review for something I bought my wife. She loved the flip top mirror inside and the grainy exfolliant inside along with the smooth like butter lip balm. Nice package for a very reasonable price. Looked at Sara Happ's line which is cute but way out of reach with the exorbant price tag. Decided to go with this instead and I can say it's only made my wife's lips more kissable. Can't be happier...
B0055STG84|4|Overall great for the price.  One brush broke the day I got it but that is to be expected for the price!
B001B0X05U|1|Smell Is real weak and doesn't last long at all<br />I spread it for two days in a row and the same affect
B00CS3T4PY|1|I feel that if I use this with the piggy paint polish it comes off faster.
B001G5HZCY|5|These have become my favorite blades for over a year now after trying a variety of different brands, which I recommend anyone new to safety razors to do. It doesn't matter if I have not shaved for a week or a day, these do a great job.<br /><br />l use these with a [[ASIN:B001LYAQ9E Merkur HD 34C, Chrome Plated]].<br /><br />Every Monday I start a new blade. You could possibly get more than a week out of them, but changing every week has become my habit.<br /><br />These are really sharp, but the first shave is not as smooth as the 2nd+ shave with them for some reason. They are still superior to the other blades that I have tried. The second shave and on is when these blades really shine. They last longer and stay comfortable longer than others.<br /><br />I try to dry the blades after every shave and have not had any rusting issues,  even the blades in my can of used blades don't show rust.<br /><br />I think everyone should experiment with different blades to find the ones they like and I use to tell people not to start with these blades because of how sharp they are. I now have a friend who started with these and loves them,  so maybe I won't give that recommendation anymore.<br /><br />Also, don't be scared of the sharpness. If you are careful and treat them with the same respect as any other blade, then you will be fine.
B0045H854W|4|Love the colors. The quality is decent, but will stretch out quickly if you get them wet while in your hair.
B009NNDG4W|5|I shaved off my Goatee on an impulse before I got to use this product. I will be growing it back very soon haha, I did however use this product on my hair as the product description said that it could be used for that. it is better then any pomade or hair gel I have ever used in my life. My hair is very thick and very difficult to manage, this product was light and held my hair where I wanted it to be all day and even after I slept on it. It is light weight and not overly greasy like some pomades are. It was wonderful and I am extremely happy with this purchase.
B00P4CZRPW|5|Fice stars
B0060L0TLI|3|Alright, took forever to get here. Dont clean with acetone
B00E1IJ43Q|2|not at all what I had thought. the product itself has a nice strong feel for heavier hair to hold
B00E644L74|4|great but was wrong size and shipped back and received the right size needed but all is well..
B000GLRREU|4|This waterpik is pretty powerful and does its job. The big downsides however are that one, its very loud. and two the tube that the water goes through needs to be a bit longer. But other than that good, sturdy product.
B00K91ONNK|5|Excellent pick me up. Freshens up highlights and gives a glossy shine to hair. I use this multiple times a week on my hair. It isn't drying or overly moisturizing. Use this with color protecting shampoo conditioner and toner for best results. Great for summer time. Makes color treated hair look a lot healthier
B0015Z7IH2|5|I have long, thicker hair and it always gets tangled. It usually takes me forever to brush it out. Im very impressed with this! Doesnt weigh down my hair and untagles it.
B001A3HPT0|4|This shave set is great for your first set. There is nothing functionally wrong with this set, and the soap it comes with is alright and has a pleasant smell. This is certainly no &#34;premium&#34; set, as others have mentioned, since the brush handle is plastic and the bowl is neither attractive nor unattractive. If you are on the fence about using a brush and shaving soap for shaving, do yourself a favor and try this out. It will cost you less than a can or two of shaving gel/cream, and I guarantee you will prefer the soap and brush regardless of which kind of blade you shave with.<br /><br />If having a wooden handle is a deal breaker, you're going to spend a lot more money.
B00CW50IXA|4|the quality is good but it slightly differs from the image.<br />This is the best quality wig i bought so far. Thanks~
B00G2XU5CW|5|This is a nice, light scent for summer.  I'm not usually into coconut, but this isn't overpowering and the lime keeps the coconut in line.  BBW has discontinued this, so I was thrilled to find it still offered through Amazon for a reasonable price.  Stock up, people!
B000GGJCOS|5|Great whiting for dentures!
B005JDPJQ8|5|Love this stuff! Doesn't leave your hair crunchy at all. Smells good too!
B0027LSEPS|4|Bought this to take the &#34;waterpiking show&#34; on the road. Wish it held more fluid in the chamber but it does the job well.
B000N5QWCM|4|Did the job and did not damage my hair - going from gray to white using wella toner T18
B002LFQ1FK|4|I've been fairly happy with this eyeliner, however I wish the tip was just a bit more exact to a point at the end.  I had been a Cover Girl LineExact Liquid Liner user for quite some time and LOVED the high precision point, but was frustrated that there was so little product in the tube which only lasted for about 3 weeks at one application per day.  This product does contain more product to begin with, but I am well past the point where I would have purchased at least 5-6 of the CG liners.  This Maybelline Stiletto is thin tipped, but not to the same exact point that the CG product was.  That is my only disappointment with this product.
B002JPJ2ZS|1|Update!<br />Viviscal has lost its magic! I realized that the first 2 boxes I bought were the old stock, it was effective and works like a miracle hence the 5 stars review I gave a few months back. I feel like I owe you guy an update as the result was completely different with the new formula. My 3 rd and subsequent purchases are of the new boxes, which I heard from other reviews that it is useless! And I must say that it is, I am very sad that after 2-3 month of vibrant hair grow the shedding starts again after I started the new formula, I continue with it since I have bought so much of it, my hair continue to drop, even those newly grew hairs are falling off! I am so so so sad why would they change the packing n formula! WASTE OF MONEY that I stock up so many boxes of junks! I want to cry now!<br />I will not give it even half a star now.<br /><br />----------------<br /><br />This is my first review writing! I am so excited, relieved and over joy my hair loss has significantly improvement only after taking this product over a month! Unbelievable ! I am 44, used to have very thick hair, excessive hair loss started 4 years ago, my fringe has never grew longer than my eyebrow and thinning on the top. I have to bundle my pony tail in 3 loop(hair band) instead of 2 previously, hair filled my comb every morning, 3-5 strains of hair come off every time I run my finger over it, hair all over the floor n sofa,  hair clog my drain, loss about 1/3 of my volume over the last 3-4 yrs. I am very healthy conscious and mostly used organic products and minimal chemical product and rarely perm, blow or color my hair after the hair loss issue started for 4 years. It depresses me.<br />I am skeptical on product n usually do extensive research before I use it especially drugs, I read review on viviscal and think this is the most promising to try.  WOW WOW WOW!! Only taking it slightly over a month,  I see less hair clogging my drain after about a month, and for the last few hair wash, the result is consistent. I am a,most back to a normal!!! I did not change shampoo or diet during this period of time, but I do start taking 10,000mg biotin at the same time, ie 2 viviscal per day (after breakfast n dinner, 1 biotin at lunch ) I do not know if my fringe will grow longer, that will have to wait a few month, but for now the excessive hair loss just stopped, I am soooo excited to share this review as I know how depressing to see your hair thinning!<br />As for side effect, I know people complaint of breakouts, I drink lots if water, but I did have some pimples pop on my face for the first few days which is rather unusual for my skin, but it goes off after a week, I quests your body adjust to the supplement, I urge you to persevere!  I am so glad to have found this product! Btw, I don't get paid to write this review, as I was so encouraged by the review written by other that give me the confident to try, I now in turn hope to help others! God bless!<br />I will update on my fringe after a few months!
B00BBD508C|5|I use this as a foot soak - after working in heels all day, it feels great to soak my feet.  I have used Epsom salt, but I have to say that I prefer the magnesium flakes.
B0009F3M6A|5|I used to use a foot cream from AVON than contained AHA but they quit selling it years ago and so I went on a search for a replacement product. I am on my second order from Amazon of the Eucerin Dry Skin Therapy Foot Creme and I am so very pleased with this product. It is really more of a lotion than a cream but it is not too runny and has a very light scent plus it is not greasy at all.  The price is reasonable when compared to other AHA foot products found on Amazon and elsewhere but best of all it works for me, even better than the AVON stuff. For the first winter in a long time, I have not had the painful cracks on my heels. I only apply it once a day after my shower and usually put on socks afterwards. I sometimes even use it on my hands since I tend to get cracks on the bends of my thumbs in the winter. Even those are less severe this year.
B004KBIGT2|5|Love the smell of Rich Suede! Coty you did great! Thanks for product and fast shipping!
B00KJEDOHI|1|I didn't like this product.
B000JL7WQK|5|Very beautiful fragrance
B00D3D35T4|4|Though the packaging is adorable, it is deceptive. The product (a black-green gel color) only fills the bottom fourth of the egg capsule. The product works well, and turns white upon contact with the skin.
B001CSZTFK|5|Perfect
B00BL9DQ3W|5|They are great and so thick! I love them!
B00KGO8XY0|5|This product works great when used as directed. It doesn't clump and makes my lashes look great. I have very short lashes that I never would put mascara on because they were just to short. Now I can wear mascara and my lashes look long and beautiful.
B0049LUI9O|5|Solid construction and works perfectly. Much better than the one I bought from Marshalls. I strongly recommend this trimmer to everyone.
B001EN2TCE|5|I found this hairspray @ a walgreens. Loved it from the start.The only place I can find it now is Amazon.Worth every penny!
B00AFJ89AE|5|Love that it has suncreen .. all in one!
B00NQND1BI|1|didn't work for me, in the end I found the cure in china they have Fu Li Kang and Li Kang Cream very strong read manual before use.
B005Q0OHJY|4|I had gotten free samples of this at Sephora, so I knew it works *before* I ordered it.<br /><br />When you put it on your T-zone (especially the nose area), your pores will literally look smaller within a few days.<br /><br />The scary-cool thing about this: it repairs itself :O! I scoop out a little chunk every morning using the spoon they provide, and by next morning, the surface of the gel is completely smooth - as if untouched. God knows what it's doing to my skin..<br /><br />Anyway, keep in mind that it's a pore tightener, not a pore cleanser. As in, you better be cleaning out your pores while you use this. Otherwise it'll be tightening your pores around any sebum already inside your pores..(read \\"more pimples\\")<br />So make sure you clean those pores out good while/before using this.<br /><br />I've been using it for a few weeks now. I guess the effect is much more dramatic the first week you begin using it.<br />Haven't really noticed any more significant shrinkage since.<br /><br />Also, like any other strong skin product, it's probably a good idea to take a break from it every now and then.<br /><br />I wouldn't claim it works for everyone, but it's the best product I've tried so far.<br />And if you just want to give it a try before committing - get that sample from Sephora ;)
B000C1Z1HE|3|Smelled better on my friend that it did when I bought it and used it.  My hubby hates it so I don't really get to wear it.  Feel like I wasted my money.  Bummer.
B006Q5XAWS|4|my fiance likes this. she got it just because she wanted to see what it was. in the end, she decided that it was money well spent
B00F1D56HI|3|It seemed like it kept my skin clean and reduced any acne I had. However, it is not foaming at all, so it feels really different than other soaps. This may cause you to use more then necessary (as I did) and run out quickly. I prefer something that foams.
B0027ER5P0|5|Fantastic product!  I had never used an instant self-tanner before, but these towels are great.  They do not have an offensive smell, they are easy to use, and I did not experience any streaking or orange discoloration.  I will definitely purchase them again!
B001E77UM4|5|My muscles are glad this stuff exists! I'm a dancer, so I use it often! I feel very relaxed and the pain definitely decreases after a bath in this stuff.
B000RLG8JE|5|It worked
B00FHB3WAC|5|Super hydrating blend for dry mature skin. Delicious
B001M5F70K|2|Okay, confession time - I purchased this product after reading that the Bad Girls Club girls all loved it! When I read the reviews for this product, I was really excited, because I love a dark lash.  I am not sure if the ladies who complained it was TOO dark have light colored hair, but on me it did not make a huge difference.  It lengthens, but it didn't do much to add a lot of drama to my lashes.  I would not purchase it again.  Thus far, the best mascara I have purchased is by Lorac - water proof black mascara, in the jean packaging.
B00R8DXFG8|5|Love this color and product
B001P20QVK|5|Easy to order and quick delivery especially in a town that offers limited shopping. Teenage boy happy to get what he needs without waiting for a trip out of town to get it
B00JZ0L7VC|5|These wewe a gift so I can't rate the product Good delivery Good price
B007PAIGYA|1|The red paint smears off very badly almost like it is bleeding. Dryer is not any quieter than another one that doesn't say &#34;quiet&#34;.
B00CJF1IGE|5|I like then
B004K3D0FK|5|All It's A 10 products are wonderful, but this one is an exception.  I love it!  Leaves hair soft and shiny, without being heavy.
B001DX98OM|5|This is a great pair of tweezers - I used one for years and years and when it broke, I bought another - very affordable and work great!
B00C7DYBX0|5|I have smile lines that really show when I am dehydrated. This has helped reduce the appearance of them greatly.  I wouldn't say it tightens the skin, but it really hydrates and brightens my skin to give it a smoother appearance. I also like using the Serum around my eyes. A lot of products make my eyes puffy(even light weight gels) but this just seems to hydrate without puffing the skin up to get rid of lines like some products do. I follow it with a moisturizer right after, and if I'm consistent, I notice results. I want to add one of the rollers to help in penetrate beneath the surface.
B0046VJTX8|4|The color is exactly what I was looking for. I was so happy to find a concealer that was significantly less than the department store prices. I now buy all my makeup on Amazon, because Amazon's prices beat department store prices. The color is exactly as advertised, and the product works well. The consistency is good, and the product stays on all day. I'm happy with my purchase!
B00CD1QU80|5|Great cheap
B00763LZWQ|5|I use them every day to brush my teeth.
B00NFQVYE2|5|This is another great product from Foxbrim! I love the pump that allows me to mist my face. The scent is nice and not overly strong. The best thing is that it makes my skin feel so good! I have particularly sensitive skin with rosacea. This product helps to calm and refresh my skin. I can really tell a difference in the redness on my cheeks. Great product! I highly recommend!<br /><br />This product was received either at no or low cost for review and inspection purposes. No compensation for a positive review was provided. All of my reviews are based 100% off of my experience with the product and I never guarantee a positive review.
B000666BVU|4|I got trial sizes of the apricot and brown sugar. I like the apricot color and smell better, and think it adds just the right amount of color/shine, after 4 clicks. However, it is def. a pain trying to remember how many times you've clicked to avoid getting too much!
B0039UT9QE|1|I'm upset they sent me the Revlon ColorStay Makeup, Normal/Dry Skin which i didn't order I wanted instead the one for Oily Skin
B002B4Q35E|5|this is a great product, I have P and it helps ease it if I use it during my tanning process, the only thing I don't like is that it has glitter in it witch you don't notice till the bottle is almost empty, a great price and arrived quickly.
B000HDP00U|5|I have been using this product for about 9 Months as a base coat and an overcoat during my manicures.  It definitely keeps my polish looking and staying fresh for two weeks.  My nails are healthier and stronger.  I got an extra bottle last time for a friend.
B0074NDF26|4|bigger than i exxpected but it's still so cool, its a magnet too<br />i love taking it apart!!!<br />=] =]
B0051UPMSY|5|I ❤ this stuff! The best hair products I've found for my grand-daughters & son's. safe light & fresh. The nicest around!
B000EPA4GQ|5|I can wear this daily without breaking out! Very light scent and doesn't feel oily at all. Recommended by my derm.
B001FBOC2A|5|Makes my damaged blonde curls really come back to life and the smell is great!!
B00HG1JFXY|5|For someone like me who has severely damaged hair this is the perfect addition to the Ultrax shampoo and conditioner. I already love how the shampoo and conditioner make my hair look and feel. This leave in treatment gives my hair that added help it desperately needs. I love knowing that this product line will help me have the beautiful hair I envy seeing on other women. The best part of using this leave in treatment is that you can use it on wet or dry hair. Those options make it easier when you're in a rush and don't have time to wash your hair because all you have to do is massage this into your scalp and you can feel it working it's way from root to tip.
B0072BA5MS|3|It gets it done. For the money it was worth it. I wasn't about to pay $300 for NONO to keep some peach fuzz of my face.
B000MD65FO|5|Excellent product and love it!!  Hope when I need more, I can find a good deal again!!!  Thanks and have a great day!!
B000GHGGKK|5|The product came on time and was what it was supposed to be.  Even though I paid shipping, it was still cheaper than full price.  Satisfied customer!
B0057Z7RI6|5|we have used volumizing products in the past and our hair stylist encouraged us to go to this product instead and we love it
B0027TZPVQ|5|keeps my skin clear without overdrying
B001E5ECTK|2|You change the gloves and they are too small
B005METWWG|5|Great product
B00NYMQ550|5|So nice on iPhone 6
B001I12G8Y|5|This is, without a doubt, my favorite black nail polish. It's super opaque and last for a long time. OPI polish always last over a week for me.
B004Z22B42|3|Product arrived quickly and in pristine condition.  Have only used it twice and feel it is way too soon to give a fair evaluation
B003FBOJJY|5|It's my first time using it. So far it's pretty good, but I would probably have to use it again to see results.  And it smells like lemon butter cream frosting, which I really love!  Her Spearmint facial cleanser is great too!!!
B0079QLSX6|3|The seller sent this product very quickly and the price is more than reasonable.  The product comes in a cool tin can with a glass lid and the product itself is very ample and well constructed.<br /><br />I was looking for something to replace the baby powder I use to prevent chaffing and periodic adjusting.  Baby powder, corn starch and talc all work great but they're very mess.  This product greatly reduces the mess the others create, but that area of my body is very sensitive so patting it against them isn't an option.  Rubbing it over them is uncomfortable in a personal way.  It's one thing when its a powder that you have to spread around, but seems unnatural when there's an artificial object involved.  Ya' know what I mean?  Maybe for other people that's not an issue, but yeah, I'm not going to reorder this product.
B000WOS71I|5|good
B000MN63CO|5|Excellent replacement. No probem.
B000PKZFZK|5|I have been using this products for years. My skin used to be super dry and peel frequently. After using this booster, my skin did not peel anymore and not as dry as before. This is a must have for sensitive and dry skin.
B00FZKB51S|5|This is just amazingly great! Very soft to use and so far it looks and feels durable! I'm very happy with the purchase.
B002RL8IWC|5|This product was recommended to me by my dermatologist to hydrate my skin, minimize my pores and breakouts, and fade acne scars. After the initial 4 days my face has cleared up tremendously. All of my breakouts have cleared up and I have significant improvement of my acne scars. I have extremely sensitive skin and struggle with eczema during the fall and winter months. My skin truly looks fantastic and I, too, have received unsolicited compliments from family, friends, and co-workers.  Definitely give the product a try! I plan to check out the Cleansing Cream and Day Cream with SPF 20 next.
B00J2APFMW|5|As good as it gets this razor is awesome.
B00MX6Q5QM|1|I have been using this for a month now and see no results. I want my money back
B00020DY2O|5|Awesome, can't say enough, really works
B00D6EDGZI|5|I received this product complimentary for testing purposes from Influenster.<br /><br />I have sensitive/combination skin. I've been testing out a few BB cream brands for quite some time now. I was a little hesitant when I opened the Ponds BB cream product as to the \\"medium\\" shade seem quite darker than the other brands I've tried and it also seemed a bit thick. Although after face application I noticed how it blended so well w/my complexion & wasn't as thick as it appeared from a bottle swatch. In fact it was very smooth, had decent coverage, a light pleasant scent, long-lasting & gave me such a beautiful glow. To top it off the fiancé (w/no information given) complimented me on how I seemed to be glowing & how I looked like I was ready to take on the world! Trust me when I say he's never noticed a change when I'd use other BB creams so this was an amazing discovery. I've been using this product for quite some time now & haven't noticed any break-outs, excessive oiliness (through-out the day) or sensitivity. If it continues to give me such wonderful results this may just be my holy grail item! I highly recommend this product for anyone in the market for a close to natural everyday look! I promise you won't be disappointed!
B0020MMFZ4|5|very good
B000KQ7U84|5|Calidad
B004JQ7MVG|1|I choose the 1 star because the product came with some of the eye shadows cracked... I can't believe the lack of bubble wrap that was around this... Did they really think by putting this in a cardboard box that it wasn't going to come all broken... What a disappointment.  I did read the reviews and most people said they love it and it came unbroken and there was only one person that said it came broken. :( now there is 2 people... ugh... I had to buy 2 of these to fix the 1 so I could give it to my neice for xmas.  These kits are VERY hard to find!
B00SSMZDR2|2|Perfect.  Just what I was looking for.  I wouldn't mind buying some just a little smaller but didn't find any.
B006VDOPPQ|1|I didn't care for this product, I didn't like the gel, and I did not see any improvement in my skin.
B008RS4LO8|5|This is an awesome deal. My local beauty supply store would charge 11 to 16 dollars for this. No complaints.
B007XTAX1W|4|Delivery was quick, and this product is wonderful!
B00NUQPYNE|5|Like the product and great customer service!
B006U3TV42|5|got here faster than expected! Everything perfect
B00NZ1WSCE|1|returned it.
B00NBT0J26|5|These come in handy for cat eyes! Especially since my eyes are small. Definitely recommend this if you have trouble with your tips.
B00HTOTWVS|5|I'm trying this because I want to keep my skin on my chest area as smooth and subtle as possible. Some of my other friends have used similar products but I chose this one, because it is made in Germany. I really prefer European products whenever I can get them. Usually European beauty products are pure grade and don't have a ton of additives that are irritating. This one works perfectly. To truly notice improvements or differences in appearances we must wear this with snug fitting tops and wear it daily if possible.
B00066YC5W|5|Bought this product for my granddaughters birthday. I am now the world's greatest grandmother. She loves it. At 17 she spends a lot of time in front of her Ilumina.
B00MOZLH6K|2|Lumpy, flaky and hard to apply evenly. Does the trick if you're in a time crunch though.
B00CHJUQGU|5|My husband won't use any other kind of deodorant. He's pretty picky. But he works hard on a farm all day and it works great so I can't complain. It smells good.  Manly :)
B00IUIVMME|5|.smell great not like adult polish. Kids like the colors and it holds up well. But polish was old and a bit sticky. Thinning it may be needed.
B000I1S18Y|4|I bought this product to cut my son's hair. The first time I used it my son complained saying that it was pulling his hair. I didn't know what was wrong so I went to read the instructions. I noticed that the clipper blades were not aligned like the one in the picture. I fixed it and after that my son did not complain anymore. I think the clipper does an okay cutting.
B002BS43HU|4|works good. warming sensation. works better if you use a belt and wrap abdominal with neoprene belt with this. like it
B001TKE47A|5|I was embarrassed when my sister called me out on mny pores -- i didn't reaized it was so bad till i bought this item-- wow in two weeks, i can tell my face looks younger and tighter.  My skin looked young -- i will buy more of this item<br />Reena Smiles
B000MC8PYY|2|small and does not elicit good results
B00S73290G|5|It doesn't get any softer or better. This it THE top of the line is ultra soft toothbrushes. I actually dedicate one for gently scrubbing my face!!!!<br />!!!!! and lots and lots of other uses!!! I keep stock on them. lol.
B00BTNYYZ4|5|My mom got this for me a long time ago.  Had problems finding it but tried many others.  This is still by far my favorite hair brush.
B00TJ7X9RG|5|Just what I was expecting.
B004V0SZNO|5|I love this product ! It has all the attachments needed to do everything you want to do. I used the buffer on my elbows and it worked like magic! Buffed put lotion on abd my elbows are back to normal . And my face feels awesome! LOVE IT! And the price is out of this world! BUY IT YOU WON'T HE SORRY!
B000K2YF1S|4|Because it has alcohol  in it, I was afraid it would burn tender tissue in perianal area but is soothing and healing upon application. It also helps heal hemorrhoids.  It's worth the price.  Application by spray is awkward but you can spray wipes  or Tucks & apply.
B00B717BEY|1|Not good quality
B00IEC9UN4|4|Nice scent.
B00GXZSAE4|5|This is by far the best shaving cream I have.
B00CDGR29G|5|Fast shipping, well packaged.  I love this set. Very cute, durable, has the backing so no possible cuts. Stamps very clear cut deep enough for full detail even the tiniest detail works well.  Would recommend. 5 stars and have used!
B001MIZMO8|5|Over the holidays, I ordered this brand of Nivea Oil Cream Body Wash....<br /><br />I will mention [that] often choose Dove or Caress for the mild fragrance, and foaming quality... So, I'm writing from constant use of these<br />two popular brands. Nivea, likewise, has a good, quality scent... Also, it isn't super thin when you pour it on a face cloth...However, it doesn't<br />foam like many popular brand body washes, and isn't a super thick in overall consistency. So, if you been searching for your next Oil of Olay--<br />you WON'T find it here. You will find a nice, mild, low foam body wash.
B00E58ZMHO|5|I've done thorough research on this product before purchasing it. Previously, I was given a sample of this product and it worked magic. I have extremely sensitive skin so I've never worn makeup until I  discovered this product. It's light, comfortable, and it also IMPROVED my skin. This cc cream blends into your skin tone so you can skip the hassle of finding a color to match your skin. What's even better is that this is a 5 in 1 (primer, tightener, whitener, covers blemish AND has SPF30). I am 110% satisfied with this ONL OCEANIQ CC CREAM and wish everyone would give this product a chance. I've recommended this to 2 of my friends and after they saw the result on my face they have purchased this product as well. Very happy customer. Thanks Katie the Babe for selling this product!
B000L2LLS2|5|Really work!
B00NHA0QA4|5|better than sensodyne
B003V264WW|5|Muy Bien
B00HF3XT6W|5|My day is filled with stress and I need a deodorant that will help keep me dry and fresh. After using Secret Clinical Strength Powder Protection Invisible Solid deodorant for a couple of weeks while exercising, it has proven to be a great product. I love that it doesn't mark my clothes with white lines as I put my work out clothes on. More so, I love that I don't stink when I'm done walking in 80 degree weather and after a full day of work. Now that summer is coming I am looking forward to how the clinical strength works for me.
B00KA5R3KU|4|it is ok
B00GZG4KSG|1|I had the same hair dryer for 10 years, and when it finally gave out, I did a lot of research before purchasing this one. It's been sketchy from then day I got it--wouldn't heat up, turned itself off all the time, etc. I haven't even had it six months, and today it turned on for a bit, then seems to have shut itself off forever. No amount of resetting or checking circuit breakers can resurrect it. Don't waste your money on this sketchy bastard.
B004KRVENQ|4|Sharp scissors and a cool little comb make a great combo for the price.
B000A3ZMLO|5|very very good, but should not  content BHA
B003B1BWA2|5|HalalEveryDay is THE best and the leaders in supplying excellent quality raw unrefined mango butter, I will not purchase this product from no other. We only this quality butter in our brand, JourneysMother lotion pellets and lotion bars. The shipping is ALWAYS FAST and problem free. I HIGHLY recommend you purchase this and many other natural products from this wonderful establishment!
B00872H42A|4|I like this product but the pump is faulty so I have to unscrew it and pour it out onto my hands. A minor complaint but other than that it is a VERY NICE and EFFECTIVE acne killer.
B00GBWJBQ0|5|These are super sharp, unlike other blades I've tried, so these require a lighter touch and good shaving foam, but the results are fantastic! The platinum finish really works, and I've used blades for a couple of weeks before changing them. 50 will last a long, long time. Worth the wait from Japan.
B002TSA90W|5|Great product.  I previously used Olay ultra, but it didn't seem to clean very well.  This is the best of both worlds.  Cleanses and moisturizes.
B001MA7QLI|5|Comfortable mist to make my skin soft, wet, and easy to absorb the following facial cream.
B000C1Z5WU|5|very good
B00KTCLH9C|4|As expected
B000ULJSYI|5|Love this.  I have fine hair and I use this with Peter Coppola Argan oil.  See my review on Argan Oil!  This Protein bodifier eliminates bad hair days from high humidity.  I live in the south and its a must for hair like mine!!
B00JQFFCHG|3|Pretty good stuff.
B00CFBM2OO|5|Good results
B008148R8E|4|This starter kit is great and inexpensive. However, the powder brush is scratchy and the head has already fall/glue is not sturdy. The contour brush sheds like no other. Other than that, all the other brushes are pretty good quality.
B00763LZWQ|5|this item is just what i wanted when i was ordering it. I got to me on time and works great! Thanks!
B00CNCA3YG|4|I ordered this kit because I was trying Vinylux nail polish for the first time.  I have to stay that the color went on very smooth but I definitely needed 2 coats of the pink color (pink bikini).  The top coat went on just as easily and the finish looks salon quality.  I think the mini bottles are a little small but it's a great way to try different colors before committing to the brand at a price that's less expensive than one no-chip or gel manicure.
B005P0UQS6|5|THIS IS THE BEST SALT IN THE WORLD.  HONESTLY, THE FLAVOR IT ADDS TO FOOD IS AMAZING.  DOESN'T COME CLOSE TO COMPARING WITH TABLE SALT.  VENDOR DID A GREAT JOB SHIPPPING ITEM WILL ORDER FROM AGAIN.  THANK YOU!
B00ATWDTIE|5|blends perfectly... except it doesnt exactly look like it... it has the pointy tip and an extra bulge at the end... Doesnt really make a difference... more bang for your buck.
B00912CL5K|4|Nothing wrong with the item it is just a bit too gaudy for me
B009T47YZ2|3|The color is very pretty it fit a lil to tight and it don't stretch much but i would buy it again for the price
B007WW1AOE|5|Their amazing !!
B004GVBZL2|5|This was recommended by a hair stylist to treat my badly dry & damaged hair. And it has helped a lot.
B0126XBPS4|5|I like the fresh breath feel after using Crest Pro Health Advanced mouthwash!<br />[you can trust this review - I am part of Shopper Army!]
B00MHZ7R20|5|these are made very well.  clamp strong and well aligned.  and I can find them in the drawer very quickly.  the only problem may be when my granddaughter the pink person tries to borrow them
B00B2B2VGW|5|This shampoo is very effective.  My hair stopped shedding and it really is clean and shiny and soft. And, it is organic. I definitely recommend this product.
B005IS51WQ|5|I received my package promptly, the item was perfect and was beautifully wrapped and placed inside a delicate jewelry bag with a hand written thank you.  I don't write reviews but how thoughtful!! Thank you : )
B000MN63CO|4|I had no idea I needed to change the head on my razor. I was getting tired of the feeling that my hair was being ripped out all the time. I was also having trouble with the head falling off constantly. Changing the head helped a lot, and now I'm back to a hairless back!
B00F5CY0AY|1|GREAT AND SHAVING LIKE A GOOD BLADE SHOULD!!!
B00G3C1GRU|5|Ordered these for my husband for his birthday.  A wonderful set and perfect size for traveling.
B008EN4VCI|2|I cant see any difference in using this product at all.  It doesnt take much either so maybe its just my skin type.
B004Q8GYES|5|Using this products makes me tend to my face long as in washing longer. I say I probably twirl this little baby on my face about 10 minutes each time while taking shower. Way longer than the quick 2 minute rag wash I usually do. I have seen a great change in my problem area....MY CHIN. I am 30 and just this summer my chin wanted to get acne bump happy out of nowhere. Since I have been using this my chin is almost bump free and smooth again. I have been using it for 1 month so far and can only say it has made me aware that I need to focus on washing my face longer to see improvements which I have. Would purchase again if the one I have breaks. User for life.
B000ORWOVW|5|I purchased the white rose fragrances. I have finally found an all natural deodorant that WORKS and LAST LONG!! I will definitely buy this product  again.The scent is just heavenly. I sniff my underarm often because of the great scent.lol
B004VGSVHS|5|This toothpaste is the only toothpaste I now buy. I saw a noticeable difference in my teeth after using it for one week. I love how it makes my teeth sparkle and how it makes my breathe so fresh. 2 thumbs way up for this product!! Whitens, cleans and freshens, what more could you ask for?
B0074NCGQW|5|I was in Sephora recently and I bought the roll on size of this fragrance.  I fell in love with it..  I wanted a big bottle.  It was exactly what I was looking for.  Reasonably priced and got my order quickly.  Thanks
B00B2OBKPC|1|Item broke after 6 months, wouldn't turn on.  Seller wouldn't honor one year warranty. Waiting for manufacturer to respond.
B001ET76E4|5|This is the only cleansing barI've used for more than a year. My skin has been going through changes and this is the only thing helping my skin.
B00JJHUOUQ|1|Best clip in hair I have ever had - Its super thick so my hairdresser cut layers and thinned it out some - Over all I just wish it would curl better with my curling iron - I used sponge rollers over night to reset the wavy - its pretty - thickest and best and I have been buying fake hair for years .. wish it had clips at the bottom - but its so perfect  and stays on easy with no problems..  RE Review - after you was this hair it turns into straw and looks FAKE..
B00O80JQCQ|5|My little girls have been getting colds a lot this past winter so I wanted to try something that wasn't medicine.  So far we have had good luck with this product.  It clears their noses up and relaxes their lungs.  They are able to get a better night rest which they need in order to feel better!  I would highly recommend using this if your kids have allergies or a cold.  I have personally used it a couple nights when my allergies have acted up, it has helped relieve some of my allergies as an adult.
B00APGIAIS|5|That work for me and took me for 2 week to grow ! I don't care about smell ....
B00XWR66EC|5|Works perfect
B000WS3CN2|5|Compact carrying case for razor.  Good for travel.
B004BD0XN6|5|I have used this L'Oreal shade for over 15 years and have found nothing that compares to it.
B001DKMY9Q|5|The razor was the second one I've purchased.  The first for my husband a year or so ago.  My son saw it and loved it so I purchased a second razor for him to take to Afghanistan.  Marine's need to be clean shaven at all times so a good quality razor is a must.  I also purchased the protection plan and received an email from Square Trade to complete my protection plan.  When I clicked on the link, it took me directly to a create account page which populated my email automatically.  I proceeded to enter a password and confirm it only to get a message that my email address isn't the one that purchased the item.  Really?  I purchased it and the protection plan came to me through that same email address.  So tell me, how can my email address be different than who purchased it?  When I called Trade Square, the representative apologized and said it was a glitch on their end.  However, it was very hard to get her to understand what the issue was and I was told to complete the warranty online.  Did you not hear me?  I can't finish the protection plan online.  Finally, the representative took down my item information and emailed me the protection plan.  Meanwhile, she never ended the call so I was left hanging to hear a bunch of ladies laughing in the background.  I had to ask if the representative needed any additional information from me.  She said no and I ended the call.  oh yeah!  My protection plan didn't say what I actually had protection for so before i could save the email, I had to add the item information into the subject line before I could file it.  Really, is there any company out there that has good customer service anymore?  Thinking NOT!
B000P2515C|5|Love it. Thanks
B005FYJDW2|2|I purchased this lipstick because I like Matte & in the picture on Amazon it looked like a pretty pink called \\" ANGEL\\" well it's alot darker in color than the picture. I made me look washed out with my skintone. and it was so drying that it seperates on your lips and loooks very drying. It gathers in the corners of your mouth literally and you have to apply again and again and then it looks awful and orangy/dark pink. Very dissappointed now especially for the price! I thought I liked it when I first put it on but now it's going in the trash.
B004H9L95A|5|Fantastic mascara! I have Asian lashes & this makes my mascara so long. I had tried some many brands and it smudges all the time. This stays on all day & when it comes to cleaning, it's so easy unlike waterproof mascara that could pull or rip off you lashes.
B000PKKAFK|5|At 63 almost 64 years old,I have always relied on a blade razor,I have tried differant elec razors and all of them irratated my skin too bad to continue using them,as I got older and not being able to see close up without my glasses I've found it harder to shave with a blade,so I thought I would give an elec razor one more chance.  I have always loved Philips products and when I seen this new razor,the arcitec,even though a little pricy,I took a chance and bought it,and its the best chance I ever took,it does take a little longer to shave than with a blade but no nicks,cuts or irratation and I get just as smooth a shave as with a blade,and I can't believe how long the battery lasts.  I Love this Shaver and if it ever breaks I will replace it with the same.
B000VEMWB0|5|I am a black African woman and I understand how hard it is to find products that work well with our skin. I was worried about spending $18 on just toner, but all my worries went out the window after the first day! First of all, it ships superfast (probably 2 days). It also came with a sample of their wonderful collagen cleanser. I suffered from old acne scars and pimples and discoloration and dull complexion. I use this product in the morning and at night and, after the first night, the multiple tiny bumps on my nose were reduced to only a few wimpy bumps. I look good! This toner also has some glycolic acid in it, so I'm sure that helps a lot.
B000OIBRZ0|5|This product is perfect for my skin.  I love it.
B001KYTT5M|5|My favorite black eyeliner! It smudges a bit but other than that it glides on perfect.
B00DAYGJVW|4|Brush to apply will work once maybe twice before hairs start fraying and making stray lines. Cosmetic is good-applicator is horrible!
B00756HQNQ|5|awesome salon quality!!!
B00014JJGQ|3|Too greasy-feeling for me and not face-friendly (really stings the eyes). The scent is more perfume-y than I like. Not the right choice for me.
B004L4EING|4|Good quality and looks great on the bathroom countertop. The brush works great and your straight razor will fit neatly in hte holder. The holder is a little light but works well. Amazon rocks on how quickly I recieved it.
B002K8W58K|5|I really like this product!
B00KXG8JBS|1|Garbage worthy , save your dollar, if anything it can cause zits due to awesome pore clogging action,texture is thick hair gel with side of bump cottage cheese, smell is old, and in no way does it contain anything good for your face
B0027SU9JU|4|works great
B000FGC99Y|5|BEST THING MONEY CAN BUY!! I WISH I HAD PICS TO POST THIS STUFF IS AMAZING AN GREAT FOR THE PRICE. ALTHOUGH I DID FIND IT CHEAPER AT KROGERY GROCERY STORE. I AM IN LOVE!
B0086V4Y2K|4|This is a very elegant foundation.  Like the product advertised, foundation stays fresh looking.
B000C234DQ|5|Love this smell
B00CD1QU80|5|good
B00CO1VBDS|4|You have to use a lil fabric softener on the bright green hair it is dry and frizzes but this wig is thick and pretty. Rich colors!
B004QWRCWM|3|I rated it a three because it needs a cord that doesn't come in the package. It's ok for a beginner and I'm happy with the quality! but I would have paid an extra few bucks to have the cord.
B000E31Q92|1|Do NOT purchase any products from AMELY BEAUTY STORE. They have HORRIBLE customer service and ship defective items. I purchased a $140 Chi Flat Iron in November 2010 and in less than 8 months the item stopped working properly and constantly shuts off. I contacted AMELY BEAUTY STORE to find out what could be done as the Chi Flat Iron was still under the one year warranty. None of my emails went answered. This is not how you should run a business and I will never purchase from this vendor again.
B001ET731K|5|I love this conditioner as well and I use it and it does add volume to my hair.  I love this company's product.  I feel they deliver what they promise.
B007QCI1II|5|I used many products before & I love this one. My sister used it at my house and purchesesd one for herself. Of makes your hair shinny and silky. I highly recommend this product.
B00021DO6Y|5|Works great!!
B009UFFSOE|5|I'm a very fair blonde that looks washed out in the winter and I am getting some fine lines too which makes putting on make up a delicate task because I hate the mask-like look that foundation can give (even when its the proper color.) I need color but I want my skin to show through which is still in pretty good shape still.  Pixi Fresh Face  solves this problem because all this does is give your skin a nice hint of color, (a robust color that looks makes you look rested, oxygenated and healthy - It moisturizes a little bit too!)  *I wear Oil of Olay Complete Defense under this for sun protection but you can omit this if that isn't an issue.<br />This stuff comes out of the bottle looking very orange but don't let that deter you from the wonderful coverage you'll get.  It lightens up to a nice transparent tint (that amazingly works for most skin color)  once it is on your skin and  blended well. Just get a good make- up sponge,  good lighting and blend blend blend - all around the hair lines and eyebrows.  This is a FANTASTIC make-up for young girls too, (even though I'm well into middle age) who are just starting to wear make up and want to avoid the make up look and allow that fresh beautiful skin to show.  No talc in the formula to accentuate lines. I've gone through three tubes and the 2-Pack is the best deal you'll get anywhere.  If you like to go bare faced more often then not, this stuff will add just a subtle touch of glamour to an otherwise bare faced kind of day.  You can get your face done fast in the morning - 1. Pixie Fresh Face, 2. a swipe of mascara and a 3. hint of lipstick and you'll look good to go and all day to boot.  This is a keeper in my go to bag.<br />Hope they never discontinue this one!
B00392C8ZG|4|This is a very nice lipstick it goes well with many colors.  I just wish it was a bit more glossy
B001A4826E|5|I bought it for my 13 year old son. My husband would use it on him and it would take out all those ugly blackheads individually.
B0009OAGRE|5|Sensational product from Perfum4us received in 10 days this time around in perfect new condition. This scent is pleasant and not overpowering, does not smell like a bathroom as it is a floral scent, thoroughly welcoming to the olfactory senses.<br />[[ASIN:B0009OAGRE Eternity by Calvin Klein for Women, Eau De Parfum, 3.4 Ounce]]
B00ANZOVAW|5|Great razor for the price, would recommend it to any one
B0017VOOGC|5|A must have for tattoo artists and piercers. I'm sure there are many other uses but thats what I got it for.
B00G7S424O|4|I'm so surprised that this got my nail polish off! I really like it and like that it's natural. Smells good. Definitely need to wash nails after use/before putting new polish on. Only problem was that the bottle was only filled up to the purple label. And the bottle is pretty small for the price.
B00JPZFXD0|5|I got this for my girlfriend and she love's the color's .
B00G9XOX82|5|my hair has never felt cleaner after using this is now my favorite and no more greasy hair.
B000PKYCJA|5|Great price
B00DG90P34|1|Arrived when expected! Could have went to the local hair store and purchased.a lot of loose hair tangled quick.not worth the price.
B0049EGEWQ|5|Very pleased with the M-90, its small compact & has locking cover. AA batteries always available. Good for quick touch up shaves in between
B000FKJPII|5|Simple emollients and humectants, ideal for men's skin. Fragrance free. Use after shave to tame inflamed skin, then follow with protectant. No goofy ingredients, just agents that work.
B0032FSDOA|5|I love this shampoo. Works great to improve the  condition of hair and decreases hair loss. I have recommended this product to family and friends.
B002DYCUW2|4|Good.  Keeps my hair soft and shiny every day.
B004HJ6CFM|5|This brush lives up to its high ratings.<br />I wouldn't mind a slightly smaller handle, I think.(I was looking for a 20102 but I couldn't find it on Amazon)<br />The brush barely had an odor: if you stuck your nose in it when wet, it had a scent, but it was not an issue at all.<br />Great starter, if not permanent, brush.
B003TQU1Q0|5|This is the only skin moisturizer that my 5 month old son can use for his eczema. I've tried Aveeno and others, but this is non-greasy, light and safe for babies as young as 3 months. :o) The pump is nice and you can get as little or as much as you want out with ease. I have on subscribe and save (every other month). Although, Wal-Mart has the same product for same price, I still buy from Amazon.
B000BU66H0|5|I used to use Purell until my drug store started carrying Jao.  Now I'm totally hooked!  The smell is amazing.  Light and herbal and natural smelling.  I use it in the office and my co-workers always comment on how nice it smells.  It doesn't have that greasy, gel feeling like other products.  I keep a small bottle in my bag and the large pump bottle at the office and in the bathroom at home.  I gave a bottle to my mom for Xmas once and she went through it in like a month!
B006CWSFAM|5|Good pricing for a great product
B005QZXK38|5|Beautiful color!
B002XHC4SO|2|The fairest shade fell out within 2 weeks of using the product. The applicator is quite inferior.... you can do a better job with you pinky finger.
B0052MTJO4|4|Works well, powerful, easy to use and change the different Diamond tips of the Mircrodermabrasion machine. Also very portable to move around per treatment rooms.
B000GIJ1XS|1|I still waiting for my item, I wrote a mail to a seller a never answer to me. I want my money back
B00TB7404A|4|When I first began using Crest 3D White I found it to be a little harsh, it made my tongue burn. Since then I have been able to tolerate the strength of Crest 3D White and have noticed whiter teeth and it makes my mouth feel really fresh.
B00FZKB51S|4|Clients love it for the price .bamboo nice
B001XURHNY|4|Good stand. Does what it should for storing my razor and brush properly. Finish seems to be holding up well.
B00D1GPMI0|5|/Users/jenn/Desktop/Jenn.jpg<br /><br />I loved it. Better the what the picture shows. Very shape like. Curls stay in tack well. When you go to brush it I would do this steps. I add water from a simple spray bottle. Just any cheep one will work and once damp I brush it from the bottom and up on each peace. It decree the chance for tangles. Also I hand on a hook to dry after its mostly dry I then take my finger and twist the curles and spay a little of water then let go of it. It keeps the curls. pretty if needed add a little conditioner make sure its water down. but other then that its a great wig. No one can guess that its a wig. They were amazed about how real it looked to my own hair when I was just 16 years old. I had long hair then and now that I am 25 my hair has been dyed a lot its purple as of now. and with pink at the ends. :) I love this wig if my other one gets to old I will buy it aging. I love it wish people knew about this one for the kids with no hair or for just fun :) here is a pic of me wearing it after having it for about a little over a week. :)
B0030LX418|4|Some say it doesn't smell like the stuff from back in the 60's and 70's but as I have aged nothing seems as it did back then.  Not that it is better or worse but it does bring back memories of those days.  I am pleased with it and it certinly does smell better than the stuff you get in the plastic bottle.  Smell goes away kind of fast but other than that, I like it.
B00CJRDEN2|3|Okay for final touches..
B006E5JACY|5|this oil is very high quality, and I would definitely recommend the Plant Therapy brand.  It is much less expensive than the MLM brands, and the company is very helpful and a pleasure to deal with.
B004MTF3KC|5|My favorite bath salts.
B00ARIE2BS|5|i bought this after using the LIGHTSTIM for a year and not really liking the results. after the FIRST week of using this at nighttime while watching TV - my skin is noticably lighter and almost perfect. this little machine is AMAZING.<br />i have nicole kidman skin. porcelain white yet patches of red and sun spots. i am an AVID sunscreen user. i will not even go in the sun without lathering it on. TOTAL BLOCK is the sunscreen that i use that is formulated to be the strongest sunscreen on the market. i've been using it for years and it really has protected my skin from the damaging rays of the sun.<br />anyway.....if you want to make your skin REMARKABLLY smoother and clearer this investment is totally worth it. my fine lines are lessening and overall the texture of my skin is smoother and LIGHTER.<br />it IS an investment, however, it is certainly worth the amount. i just cannot get over how much brighter and lighter my skin looks. this thing is AMAZING!!!
B00JJPMXDO|1|It's not too expensive but it's not as moistening for a night cream.
B005P0ION0|1|Left my hair greasy
B009W8UJFM|4|I like these but they are not as moisturizing as I would like them to be.  Moisturizing wipes are an easy way to moisturizer arms, legs, and body.  I searched the Internet and there are not many available.  These were one of the few.  I would also like them to be a little larger and sealed better so they won't dry out.  They were priced economically.
B00027DMI8|4|I just started using it about a month ago. No noticeable difference in wrinkle reduction but also, no bad side effects.
B00147FGJ8|5|I haven't been to a tanning bed in over a year. Tonight I went and used this product, wow! I can already see color! I'm loving it, so much I think I'm going back first thing in the morning. This paint it black lotion is no joke and with the price I'm not using it sparingly, already have a back-up bottle on it's way. Im 100% satisfied, all pros, no cons. Thanx, you have got yourself a new loyal customer. Sheila B.
B0002I60FY|3|Crack the Whip is an excellent exfoiliatng/moisturizing bar. It has a great smell which is very nice with Lush's Dream Cream, for those of us with super dry skin. The only probably is that it leaves the tub with a big black ring in it, and if you have a slow draining shower, it gets all over the floor. I would recommened Buffy the Backside Slayer over this product.
B00155P9CI|5|classic cologne love that they still make it it is awesome ladies love it smells real good awesome dude awesome
B000Q34RP0|5|Exactly what I wanted
B000H9C6RY|5|This kit has pretty much all you need. Get some baby powder for prepping the area and baby oil for residue removal, and you are good to go. I will never pay for salon waxing again. Yay!
B000VLXMC6|3|I was interested in this relaxer after reading all the great reviews it got but I was deceived! I wanted to try it because my scalp always burns with perms then I have to hurry in rinse it out which causes my hair to not be straightened. I thought this relaxer would be gentle but it burned 5 min after I started the smoothing process. I was really worried my hair was gonna<br />Come out in clumps! Thank God it didn't. I'm still giving this relaxer 3 stars because although I had to rinse quickly my hair was super straight. My hair is fine so I didn't really want bone straight results but that's what I got. I feel this relaxer probably works best on thicker hair if you have fine hair like me be careful and don't leave on for more than 10 min.
B006W2SYGM|1|My razor is about 14 months old and needs  replacement heads.  The replacement head are unavailable and/or very very over priced. I paid about $270 for my razor and now I need new heads at $100+<br /><br />I have used Norelco since I started shaving... a long time ago...<br /><br />Norelco seems to have cheapened their product and are focusing on making their profit on parts and repairs.  This is not the Norelco of old.<br /><br />I have a 20 year old Norelco that I keep in my suitcase for travel... original batteries... It's charged up and my $270 worthless shaver is going in the trash.  My next razor will not be Norelco!
B00008O2X5|5|This is my favorite anti-perspirant.  I buy it in bulk on Amazon.  The price is great and the product works!!  I love Almay products and this one lives up to the Almay name!
B005DIQD00|5|I've tried a few other shaving soaps and they just won't do.  Parker Sandalwood & Shea Butter lubricates well without being greasy and has a mild scent that I love. I no longer have irritation and redness and shaving seems to take less time.  They cost a little more than the cheap shaving soaps but the bars seem to last a long time.  Super Safety Razors ships quickly and reliably.
B0013945H6|5|This product is excellent. I have used it for the last 3 years and would not be without.  It is expensive, but when I find a special, I stock up.
B00AU1JU78|1|I honestly can't believe this is a real thing, it is amazing that people can't go 5 hrs on a plane with out feeling the need to spray s*** on their face. If you need to hydrate your face stop smearing make-up all over it. I mean seriously save the 14$ and do something useful with it.
B00198ZOU8|4|This works way better than the sock we used to use for buns!  I love how you can push the bobby pins through the donut, which holds it in place great.  The only thing is that it's pretty big, so it wouldn't work well for short hair, or very thin hair.  My daughter's hair is long and thick, so it covers up the donut pretty well.  Overall, I'm really glad we got this.
B0023B3OIO|5|Just love this color
B002RT7BH2|5|Works like a dream!  I would purchase again!  BTW, I use it for a walk-in shower and not a tub.
B005X26JOQ|4|muy buena
B000T1XQXS|4|I use it every day
B007HEP0R0|5|I have fair, freckled, sensitive, combination skin, as you can imagine it is hard for me to find a moisturizer that will not cause breakouts or aggravate my skin. I was going through a particular bad skin phase when I bought this; my skin was having both dry and oily patches with red under the skin acne around my foreheard. I had purchased all sorts of products, high end to natural, nothing was really working. After using this product for about a week, I started noticing that my skin was balanced and I was not getting any more breakouts. Fast-forward to a month later I have 0 redness, 0 breakouts, and glowing skin. I do not need to wear makeup, other than under my eyes, since I have dark circles (genetics, mom, grandmas), my skin is glowing.<br /><br />Aside from this product, the only other thing I am using on my face is Walgreens generic version of Hibiclens, which a pre-surgery wash not designed for the face, but again, doesn't irritate my skin and is meant to kill bacteria without causing resistance. I started using both products at the same time, so I cannot comment whether the effects I am seeing are from the combination of the two or just one. If you want to try Walgreens generic version of Hibiclens as a face wash, just be careful to not get it in your eyes as it stings a lot, wash it off with a lot of water to ensure that your face is 100 free of it.<br /><br />I am using this product 2x a day, morning and night, face and neck, have gone through about 1/2 a bottle. I just pour it in my palm and spread it by patting it on, since there is less wasted product this way than if I were to use a cotton sheet, also because I have sensitive skin rubbing on cotton is not a good idea.
B0028NA9US|5|Love, love, love this stuff!  Really great conditioner and it makes hair shine.
B000SDX97A|1|Huge brush and hair gets caught don't know how to use this thing because my hair kept getting stuck and I was trying to be very carefull to not damage my hair breaking it :(
B00AEINQ9K|5|Always preferred the rotating heads, but my 3 heads uit is too bulky for the pack it in the overhead era.  Had a prior version of the bettery operated 2 head unit for over 15 years, but alsa it came to an end.  This one is a great replacement. Sizewise about the same, slightly lighter and definately a nice close shave. Batteries last well and fits into my small overnight toiletries bag.  I much prefer this to the vibrating foils
B00HO2XYEQ|5|I love this set of makeup brushes. I bought is specifically with the case for travel.<br />The case itself is great, but a little bit too heavy. In general I would recommend this set.
B000EZQGU4|5|I feel so much cleaner and fresh with this than a luffa sponge. Plus this doesn't fall apart with use. I throw it in the washing machine every now and then to clean it. But it is easy to rinse out in the shower as well. Great exfoliator.
B004DIVXQU|5|I have almost all the colors and I love them all. They blend out easily giving a very sophisticated soft smoked-out effect. They look very expensive on. Since they are loose, they do have a bit of a fallout so I prefer to do my face makeup after I finish my eyes, whenever I use these. the colors are gorgeous. Elegant is the most beautiful champagne-colored highlighter ever! I love, love, love these which is why I bought some 30 of them (I think I'm only missing 2-3 of the colors offered on the ELF website - also just $3 there!). Highly recommended!
B009MY158G|5|in the bottle, it reminds me more of a &#34;peacock&#34; than a scarab... beautiful blend of teal blue with hints of gold, but when you put it on, it comes out more like a chrome-ish teal. still a beautiful color, but not sure if you need to apply a third coat to get the gold shimmer.
B005IW7QW0|5|Smells great. Scent lasts long and could be worn anytime of the year.
B000V2ACH8|1|I did not honestly expect it to be so small... one star.
B000R830IE|5|love this curling brush, I have infinity straightening iron and loved it, so got this<br />infinity curling brush and loved it. Thank you
B001UE60E0|5|Great product, have used for quite a few years.
B003WR3QSG|5|Considering the cost of some of the other brushes on here, I was a bit skeptical. But it it has been a very good brush so far, has only shed a few hairs from what I can see, and does a great job of lathering. Will order this again when this one gives out. This was the first time I have ever bought or used a brush like this, so I'm a bit green and don't have much to compare it to, but so far I am very happy.
B001ANJ0V6|5|quality product
B001V9GSN2|4|They are great for pigtails and braids.  Too small for ponytails because my daughters hair is thick.  These would probably work well for a toddler's thin hair
B00NO8DT2G|5|My whole family (including my 2 kids) love the balms and use them. It may feel a little bit greasy, but really keep your lip moisturized and help the cracked lips to heal. I also like it is made from natural stuff and feel safe to use them on my kids. Recommended!
B00GOY38ZU|5|I like my Jwoww and would like another one, But I did not want Solid Black  Bronzer.nor do I like it.
B00PK3DW16|5|A friend of mine has had an aggressive health situation, and with the use of this product, we think it could actually be reversing. I can't say enough about it; I believe it has begun to give him his life back. :))))))
B000Q3X1HU|3|Received a bottle with a lot date from 2004....IN 2014!
B0009MFUPO|5|the replacement heads work fine.
B00763LZFI|2|For soft bristles, this was really hard!
B002AMUF3I|5|I got my Clarins Super Restorative Night Wear today.  I'm very impressed, its MUCH less than it is in the department store, $35.00 less! It came in the original Clarins box with other samples.
B001X45KM0|5|An excellent product for dry skin when used as directed.  Highly recommended for use, especially in the winter when dry skin is a problem.
B001EUS62Y|1|I bought this product, because I was suddenly breaking out on my back and the reviews were good, but like every product out there, it depends on the person. It smells good and lathers really well, but I have already used half the bottle and it made me break out even more. I would not recommend this at all. Now that it's hot, I can't even wear tank tops anymore. Be careful before you buy.
B00LH25A32|1|Besure to purchase these from Moon Sugar Decals. The ones I received are not althentic and the clarity differs from the pictures posted of the product.  I have contacted Amazon regarding this situation.
B0061JPJ28|5|Great stuff
B00A2GPDAY|5|It's not expensive, it's well made and it lathers nicely.  It didn't stink in the first uses.  It fits in my perfecto razor/brush stand nicely.<br /><br />Some have complained of the handle cracking or the knot falling out.  It's incredibly important to take care of any natural hair brush.  Rinse thoroughly and dry UPSIDE DOWN.  If you don't, water pools in the handle and will start to ruin the brush.<br /><br />Take care of this fine WSP brush and it will deliver years of great service to you.  Great great value.
B001AWEARG|1|smell is horrid
B000QYN81I|5|Good stuff!  It works well!  I use 2 drops and there is no evidence of bad smell left.  Last along time! I recommend this item.
B00CO94DDK|5|My hair is growing like weed, awesome product I use it everyday it's light comparing to many oils on the market. This stuff really works.
B002RZ9KNE|5|I have used this product for a few years and love it. Multi-purpose, use on cheeks, eyes and to define and enhance. Would recommend to any and all!
B006ZBP8NM|5|Great deal and great product and fast ship!  Thank you!
B00BD822BI|4|I am a 53 years old and suffer from extremely dry skin. This cream is very rich and leaves my skin feeling smooth and radiant. I have used it for 3 weeks and have noticed that my fine lines don't look as pronounced. I definitely feel this is a great product and will continue to use it.
B002VUME42|4|I've only been using this product for 1-2 weeks and I see a difference. The fungus on my nails wasn't as bad as some people's but still ugly and this treatment is helping. I am 7 months pregnant and my doctor said its ok as long as it's a topical and not an oral treatment. I'd use it again but hopefully it doesn't come to that.
B00OS76A6E|2|So so
B0046VILNW|5|Favorite colors
B0083I26DA|4|Works great!  Happy with product and price and packaging.  Shipment arrived on time.
B00MC3KDQY|4|This stuff smells so good and my son and hubby both loved their bottles
B00FH692PQ|3|My hair still falls out, althought the amount has decreased. Definitely needs a conditioner- hair is very natty without it.
B00ES0Z206|4|It worked ok, maybe I just need to purchase some more
B000T9BMBS|5|I discovered Alfaparf at beauty exhibition few years ago and was given few testers. I tried shampoo and this illuminating serum and was amazed. It fines hair, makes it shine, doesn't feel oily. I have oily, died hair and apply this serum occasionally. My hair feels like after saloon.  Would recommend to everyone.
B002ISZ0CK|5|This kohl eyeliner is wonderful. I am a middle aged woman.  I apply it under my eyelashes on the top and then slide it across the inside of my lower lashes. I have gotten so many compliments when I use it.  It looks like I had plastic surgery on my eyes.  Very happy with this purchase.  The end of the tip did curl so I just push it back against the inside of the top before I take it out.
B0026IBSVE|5|Works great! Easy to use. Can save a ton of money. This set cost about the same as 1 haircut!
B006FM3UVS|5|I would recommend this to everyone wanting a deep tan this is a great product I am very happy with the overall condition of this lotion
B003N41WWA|5|In love with this stuff.  Doesn't cause greasiness and does exactly what it says!
B001G7R3L0|5|Very good, have no effect, but I will insist to use, want to get good results, I will continue to pay attention to, thank you very much
B00VXE0EEY|5|This is a great, gentle, non-greasy formula that absorbs instantly. I use a drop on my forehead, chin and each cheek and rub it in that way. It lasts months as long as my boyfriend doesn't get into it.
B000JNQSIQ|5|my wife love it very much, she cut my hair and the kids
B000OF009M|4|I bought this product to be able to cover up my tattoo that I have on my leg and I must say it works wonders. I love being able to cover it up and not have problems of it smearing off my skin. I would recommend this item.
B000GZD1JG|5|It is easy to use and I like how my hair looks after using it, and I don't burn myself like I did when  using a curling iron
B007RYVFC4|5|Really enjoyed this product.  I put it to the test with 36 hours straight of wearing.  After the 36 hours I still felt fresh and smelling good.  I definitely recommend this to anyone who likes gel deoderant!
B000NO713C|5|Large, soft cloths to keep hands clean and sanitary.  Keep a supply in purse, car console, gym bag.  Easy to transport.
B000UPO54M|5|I knew about this product and just purchased another.  I bought it at a great price and got it very quickly.  Happy with purchase!
B002QFSIW4|4|its easy to mix and anyone can use this! Love the colours very vibrant you should consider putting in a mirror though.
B004MKEGWM|5|Fight marks as promised. Very good product!
B004KRYXHK|4|Leaves me feet real soft..Doesn't help much with the fissures but its still good to have to leave your feet soft.
B002ZNJI8A|3|not really an afro as it appears more like a curl sorta loosens once its wet , not worth 50 bucks to me  wont be purchasing again
B0011DHE86|4|Helps digestive system, can help keep you regular. It is also helpful with heartburn. The Taste is tart but ok/pallatable.
B000V1QLEM|5|I've had Polymorphic Light Eruption since I was about 4. Every time I go out in the sun, I break out in a terrible itchy red rash, and I've never found a sunscreen that helps at all...until now. Here's how I tested it: About a month ago I went up to my friend's house by the river and was out in the sun for about one and a half hours. Even though it was later in the day I still got a rash on my arms and neck. This week I went back to the river armed with this sunscreen. I was out in the direct sun on my friend's boat all day (noon to five), and my skin had zero reaction to the sun. I was seriously impressed. I don't find this sunscreen that greasy unlike other reviewers. I actually think it blends in really well, and it has no odor at all. I'm so happy I found something that works!
B00BZCTOAO|5|works very good best price
B000052YN6|5|love this product !!!!<br />thank you
B009Z4OI4G|5|Bought this as a gift for my wife and daughter. It is one of their favorite perfumes because of the scent and the ability to wear it with casual or formal attire. It took some effort to find the blue triangle version, but I did. They are happy which makes me happy. I also like the smell on them and it is one of my favorites to when they wear it. Clean and refreshing and not over powering.
B002EZIXQ2|1|This is my second time ordering this relaxer. And both times the activator leaked out. I'm scared to order another one.
B001ASDHYW|5|This is the perfume I have been filing for years.  No longer available for purchase in my local store, unfortunately.
B00F3S4OPG|4|it was a nice smelling perfume but i wont be purchasing it in a full size. i like something that smells a bit stronger and fruitier.
B000PY17PI|4|not as well made as the one it's replacing ?
B00FN61ZB4|5|I love these things. They hold up well to mulltiple showers and smell so good.  Great texture on the sponges. I've bought them from other suppliers but this is the best price I've found.
B000C1UD8Q|4|I have tried other cocoa fragrances before and have been completely disappointed. They smell like alcohol or are just unappealing. Not so with this perfume. It has a wonderful soft cocoa/vanilla scent and smells wonderful. Plus, I paid $35 on Amazon compared with $75 at other websites.
B0012X7JYO|5|I already have several of these and I love them. Very large compartments. Easy to open. Easy to close. Great.
B00FZEWOYG|5|Best wig I've ever owned. Easy to style and very soft and slow to tangle. Will be buying again. Love it and use it to cosplay Mikasa and Toudou Jinpachi.
B001KYO65A|5|I've been using this same brush for years so I'm not new to the product. What I love is it's great at getting out the tangles in my long thick hair without breaking the hair, even when wet. Also great for helping me get some volume and helps me straighten the hair when blow drying.
B00ARTK9NW|2|Smells and feels like chemicals
B00GBM0UYW|4|Very well constructed for the low price. Surprised by the quality and dazzle. Niece who ordered it is very pleased with it.
B000MGOZJ4|5|This oil is a part of my daily cleaning. Love it!
B003S56J4K|5|It heats u p really fast and the broad blade helps to straighten my thick hair faster. The swivel cord makes handling extremely easy- loved it!
B005JV1YRI|5|I seem to notice a difference.  I believe one may need to use regularly.  I plan to order more and consistently.
B00C7DYBX0|5|My absolute favorite facial serum it feels sooth on the skin don't burn don't irritate the skin<br />But you can definitely see results and feel how it transform your skin definitely great love this would recommend this.
B00011JP1S|5|This is the best! I put on 7 coats; 2 ridge filler, two Duri strengthener, two color polish and one Diamond Dry.  Within seconds, the top layers dried and then in about one minute, all 7 layers were completely dry. It has been 6 days and zero chipping. This product is truly awesome.
B004GEXU5S|5|32 years old with breakouts/adult acne on the sides of my face/chin: after 3 uses...98% GONE! I use a make up remover pad afterwards as well because my make up isn't fully off after wash...a wash that works truly! Look beautiful and feel beautiful!
B006RBGCJO|5|I got this for my sister for the holiday season and she absolutely loves it.  It was the right sent to get her however it is a matter of opinion so I would suggest that you go to a store and see which one that you like.
B0027WPJRI|5|This stuff feels like &#34;velvet&#34;.  I wear it alone without makeup and it gives me that even skin look.  its not greasy or too dry, just perfect.  I've recommended it to everyone.
B001KYU50U|5|I love then.
B00147FGJ8|5|I've worked in a tanning salon and have used $100+ bottles of tanning lotion and this compares! This is a great product at a great price!
B0018DE6AI|5|I love this scrub! It's nice and thick and a little will take you a long way. I use this to get rid of the bumps I get on my legs from shaving and my legs feel extra smooth! If you want a hard scrubbing I use the scrub before the water hits my skin and I have smooth skin everytime!
B001H270RQ|5|This works great! It adds a nice shine to the polish. Dries very quick and makes the color last a long time. It's better than most other brands I have used.
B0036C0UEU|5|good product, different packaging than what is shown here though
B005GXQ02I|5|This is the first review I have ever written.  This product is incredible.  I have incredibly sensitive skin and am very prone to ingrown hairs after waxing/shaving, esp. around my bikini area.  I have tried other ingrown serums, but nothing has been effective.  I have only been using this for a few days, but am already seeing significant results.  Red and dark spots from old ingrowns are fading, and ingrown hairs are coming out to the surface.  I am very excited to see the results of a few more weeks of use.  If you have any trouble with ingrown hair I definitely recommend you try this.
B00CVPLD5S|5|I receive the beads way before I was suppose to and I really like them, my grandchildren all ready made earrings with these bead, and they look beautiful... I will recomment to my family and friends and will buy again...Thank You....
B000OYGP8S|5|I was reluctant to order this product because I feared that they were all hype.  They weren't and I am SO glad I purchased it!  The fragrance is wonderful and clean, the lather is fantastic (you only have to use a small amount), and it made my skin feel like crushed velvet.  I have found my new favorite shower gel!
B001ELJO0Q|3|Curlers are so heavy ...I have long layered medium length thick hair ... they still fall out ... like clipping rocks to my head, also don't get very hot ... works okay to smooth out frizzy hair and give a little curl.
B0012GVMWG|5|this shampoo is amazing!! leaves your hair smelling great, feeling great. love the fresh line. just wish it wasn't so expensive and wish there was a conditioner to go with it.
B001ET7E9Q|5|Good conditioner.
B000T9BMBS|5|Wonderfully light and the fragrance is amazing. Would recommend to anyone who uses an oil serum in their hair. Five stars.
B0017PUPMK|5|Couple things about this brush. First of all, love this brush! And second, this brush is NOT for detangling. Boar bristle brushes are not made for that purpose. Your only supposed to use it after your hair is dry and detangled. Also, the size of this brush is probably better suited for people with longer hair.
B004ETQ99O|5|These are not huge bags but they are the perfect size to hold a t-shirt, some candy and other trinkets. The quality is really good for the low price. We also took them and added names in glitter to personalize each bag.
B00HT6E2JI|5|Even though I was lucky enough to receive this razor as a BzzAgent and it has completely won me over and I'll buy it again because it's worth every penny! The long lasting effects of this razor are dreamy! This razor just keeps giving silky smoothness with no irritation afterwards. This razor truly out performs that of any others I have tried so much so that I would put it in a class of it's own. It is my new standard for shaving. Highly recommended to anyone who values a quality product.
B0001ZWM8M|5|Love it. Was the wonderful genuine perfume I hoped for.
B00H168ZDK|5|I couldn't tell the difference between the real and these! I will be back to purchase more in the future!
B00GNB3MRI|5|big hit with this.  she loves to paint finger nails and play dress up.
B001XURHGQ|2|The soap was mediocre and the mug is poorly designed. A shaving bowl should be, well, a bowl. The round bottom makes it easier to mix the soap and water with your shave brush. This massive mug is too large and the angles at the bottom are to sharp to easily work up a lather, either with a soap puck or cream. Do yourself a favor and get a bowl. Seriously, any small bowl will do.
B006L1DNWY|5|These brushes are so easy to use, I love them! You can do so many designs with them. Also, the brushes work just as good with nail pOlish as they do with acrylic paint. All you need to do to clean these brushes is pure acetone! I absolutely love thes brushes. If you're considering to buy these, do it! You can do so many designs with these brushes. Also they packing was in great quality and they came weeks before they were supposed to! These are a great buy at great price!
B00068EXQ8|5|I would definitely recommend this product. It is very efficient, the price is very good and plus it was exactly as descirbed. This product deserves 5 stars!
B00L1I1V44|1|These are not as easy to apply as they indicate.  The strips seem to begin dissolving immediately before you can even get them placed and they definitely do not last up to 30 days.  I would have been happy for 3 days.  Took the plunge and spent the money seeking immediate pain relief and wish I hadn't.
B002ZMF6ZU|1|These small tabs are moisture sensitive and heat sensitive . Once you have half of the tab on the other half does not apply as easy. I used 5 in a row a just could not get both sides on evenly . Removing a half on invisible total care rips your lips ,which is terrible for an already sensitive area . Use these if you are truly desperate . If  you are at the early stages of a cold sore I would advise just to use alcohol.  These s***ty little pages just upset me
B0000535TD|4|From the Seller's description I was under the impression it only contained Vitamin E oil, but there are several other ingredients. I have acne prone and very sensitive skin so I will not be able to try this product on my face, chest or back, but it works okay on my legs. I should have zoomed in on the picture, it shows on the bottle it contains five oils...
B001DJCJOM|5|Excellent product!!!
B00A84H1I2|5|I tried this polish a couple of weeks ago in a salon in Atlanta and absolutely love it.  It's so fun and the color changes as soon as the nail gets warm or cold.  At room temp my nails are fuchsia with purple tips and dark purple when they're cold.  It will change instantly under hot or cold water.  It's a real conversation topic at parties and so fun!
B005FMUBLG|5|I use this bag to hold my nail polish. It has held up well and I love that it is clear so I can see all the colors without emptying the entire bag. It also has a handle that works well and supports all the weight of the polish.
B00FS2N3FE|5|This is the best quality toothbrush on the market today. You can't purchase a better toothbrush that flosses and cleans at the same time. This is my fourth Sonic Care. I had cosmetic dentistry when I was 18 and my teeth are in top shape and condition and much is contributed to this toothbrush.
B000UQIRM2|2|24 bucks (incl. shipping) for 3 of these? The label was printed on and smeared off with little effort. Bristles are beginning to come out. I suppose the next thing will be a broken handle; I hope not. These  are not very well made, but I'll use 'em until I don't.
B00EA5B2VW|5|great product
B009CNA3ZI|4|These were pretty much what I expected, and they arrived very quick.  I just found the holes are a little small when trying to get a hair sewing needle through them, if you're making a wig.
B00076ZPJI|5|The product was exactly the right one for my Intellilean system. <br />The refills are better in my opinion then the original or at least they seem to be. <br /> <br />If you don't have a Sonicare Toothbrush I highly recommend purchasing one from Amazon. <br /> <br />Service is fast
B00GI21NW8|5|I have tried other brow products to fill in my scarce brows and this is the only product that looks natural. I have dark brown/black hair, and i usually get soft brown and it looks very natural. I hate the price but until I find something cheaper that looks natural, this is my go to all the time.
B001J6O5V4|5|A fraction of the cost of purchasing at WalMart or similar big box store, the multi-pack is cost effective and will qualify in the future for the 15% off in addition deal.  Great deodorant for the price in the multi-pack.
B005FMUBLG|5|Good
B000CSLIII|5|Love this for my hair!
B0086LC0WG|5|Does not come with container as shown - for adult hands (not for children).  Works wonderful.
B001ELTPUU|5|I am extremely impressed by this product.  The nail polish is very long lasting.  When I apply 2 coats to a french manicure, the manicure lasts up to 7 days with only tiny chips appearing on the 6th or 7th day (which can easily be touched up).  I have also applied it over a clear \\"sticky\\" basecoat and have had the same long lasting results.  As described, the nail polish does make your nail bed pinker but I did not notice the tips of my nails looking any whiter.  Although it is a clear nail polish, there is a beautiful cast to the polish in the bright light giving the nail a noticeable clean and finished appearance.   Although I don't think it looks like an actual French Manicure, when used alone, the results are very pretty.  I liked the product so much that I bought two additional bottles for gifts.
B000BIUGV4|4|Exactly what my wife wanted.  Received in a timely fashion.  Would use this product and supplier again.
B001BMJPD4|2|The mascara did not hold up to the rain. Also, it flaked way too much.<br /><br />Overall, it was a disappointment as a waterproof mascara.
B00ICVMZFC|1|Didn't work. Disappointed.
B0016BN4YQ|4|Very good product for the money. The stand actually holds all the peices very well. I do not like that the stand has a curved back.
B000C1ZB3I|5|I have worn this fragrence for 20 years and still have people stop me and ask what it is.  I never get tired of it.  It is a soft woodsy, floral scent that everyone loves.
B003658QH0|5|I have oily skin and the matte is perfect for me. I have very tan skin and the Golden Tan really works well with my tone.
B003XU8ABA|5|Great item! I'm still learning how to use it properly lol but I've used it twice and was pleased with results!
B008F5CZTG|5|Put these NiMH batteries in place of dead original NiCad batteries, the charge lasts so much longer, up to 3 weeks!
B007OU499W|1|I got one of these each for my mom and my best friend for Christmas. My mom and I were in the bathroom tring to put the different sizes on. She put the one inch on the fitting and it worked fine.... For a week then it read err in red every time she tries to use it . So I went to look at the instructions and she was doing everything right. My best friend wand never worked correctly it just read err also. Needless to say a waste of time and money. For an expensive wand I thought it would at least work for a year.Next time I'll just go with nume or conair.
B003V37Z6U|4|Great product, great service
B00A5MQE94|5|love it!!
B002PBCAEQ|5|Smells great, the exfoliating scrublet that comes with the bottle is pretty handy, leaves my skin feeling softer and brighter.
B0034ZYVXU|5|Works! Works! Works! Works! Works!  Leaves my sensitive skin a little red, but I moisturize!
B004TSF8R4|3|My skin is sensitive. Feel itchy when using it to apply powder. It's just not soft enough for me.
B000V5PD74|5|I purchased this color and brand because this is what my sister wears and I liked it on her.  I didn't know if it would work for me but I do like the color on me and plan to purchase more tubes.  Lipstick never seems to stay on my lips very long so I can't make a comment on how often anyone would need to apply it.  It works for me and I am happy with the purchase.<br /><br />If anyone can make a suggestion as to how I can make lipstick last longer on my lips I would like to hear from you.
B00181YF6U|2|I have enjoyed the Chi brand hair dryers for several years but it seems the elements tend to burn out early. The last two Ultra Chi hair dryer elements have failed early. The first one at 13 months and the second one at 8 months. Not gonna bother with the warranty procedure. I am giving another brand a chance to shine.
B002UU9Q6W|5|This lotion is wonderful!  The bronzers are amazing, and it's instant results!  It leaves your skin extremely soft, and the smell is really nice!  I am a red-head, so I typically burn for awhile in the tanning bed, but this lotion stopped me from burning, and I'm already building my base tan after only a few uses!
B001DU718U|5|It works great. Can tell the difference in a week.
B001B87SFA|5|I purchase this soap regularly. I love the smell and the quality of the soap. The scent lasts all day and is very refreshing and people always ask me what scent I'm wearing.
B003IM5W6Y|5|These gorgeous shadows are super-shimmery and highly pigmented.  The colors go very well together, and the dark purple is fantastic to mix with other pinks and purples as well.  It's worth the money.
B004D24818|5|This stuff is great for pre-menopausal women! It got rid of raccoon eyes that come from getting up at 3:30 am for work. It also puffs up the wrinkles and makes them disappear! It's so nice to not look like a hungover raccoon every morning! No burning itching heat or any side effects! It is light weight it is not greasy and absorbs instantly. I would recommend this for any woman who is facing her 40's and not loving it.
B00DW08MPA|4|this is between a 3 star and a 4. Its good for summer time, it feels like its water based, nice product under makeup if you have oily skin. This tastes awful however so be careful around the lip area.
B005C1C02S|5|This item came super early- like way earlier than expected and there are so many rhinestones.<br />They're very sparkly and blingy, and just the right size for any type of nail art.<br />I'm very pleased with this seller and item and if you're skeptical, I recommend getting this product.
B004ZMCUIO|4|I love this stuff! However, this is the second time i've ordered it, and both times the bottle has leaked! I just transfer it to another bottle, but it's a hastle. If they fix that I would give it 5/5!
B0027LSEPS|3|I have had two of these products for myself and husband..  They work great; however, trying to get the top open to replace batteries is nearly impossible; and secondly the batteries do not last but a few weeks at best (if you use it everyday). I would now opt for a rechargeable or electric irrigator.
B000P20QTI|5|My wife loves 360 by Perry Ellis, it makes a beautiful woman that much more beautiful
B00112BU2S|5|This is a great product with a great value!
B00BKOL540|5|works great
B004IM0KYM|5|These are wonderful products. We started using tea tree shampoo after a lice epdisode and will continue doing so as a preventative. The Trader Joe's brand works great is is less expensive than what I was buying at the salon.
B00KL0HV56|5|works your skin will be so smooth wow you can literally put it anywhere on your body great stuff
B004EFSLY4|5|This lotion is the best I've ever tried.  The smell is delicious and not too strong.  The ingredients are truly 100% pure - no parabens or anything else fake.  It sinks in quickly and isn't greasy.  The best part is how soft and healthy my skin feels!  Amazing!  I use it on my face too and it doesn't break me out or irritate my very sensitive skin.<br /><br />No packaging blunder! - there is a graphic of stacked chocolate bars that kinda looks like marker marks, not actual marker marks.  All the ingredient, etc. information is there.  What a shame for a great product to get such a bad review because someone can't tell the difference between magic marker marks and a picture on the label.
B00IRKRK9O|3|This is a very strong mint flavor, which I do not like, and will be glad when I finish it.  The original mint is much more mellow.<br />Delivery was fine.
B000WUCENY|5|I bought this product for my mom cause she had sores in her head n the Rescue Eczema has made a drastic improvement in the condition of her head. I'd recommend this product to anyone having problems.
B000HLWXPW|5|I love how matte the veil makes my face! It also helps diminish imperfections.<br />It's a large amount for a great price!
B004BCZ3YG|5|Wore this eyeliner when I ran this year's Boston Marathon. It rained the whole time and my eyeliner DID NOT BUDGE. are you kidding me??? literally flawless.
B000VI1190|5|perfect for my project!!!
B003WR3QSG|5|For the price you can not get a better brush then this! Excellent !
B00068F15K|5|This was a gift and I was unsure about this purchase, since I don't  know much about groomers and trimmers.  The recipient was thrilled and said it worked great!  Another great deal !!
B002XQ1Y86|3|It sure is worth the money. Not bad for the price. I wear it daily. I will order it again.
B00C3GW944|4|The smell of this product is absolutely AWESOME!!!  I just wish it lasted longer.
B00IT1HKV4|5|Makes my really dry chemically processed hair so soft! Put it in my curly hair after showering the night before, woke up and I looked like I just came from the salon. Only thing is make sure you don't put it on the top parts of your head it weights it down, there's a card that comes with instructions.
B003SR4KJE|5|Nice product, works really good and my boy's hair is now on style :)
B000BI8O0O|1|The bottle was extremely small. Could of bought twice the size elsewhere for the same price. Package was old and had a dead worm inside. Could not even smell it.
B0009MFUPY|4|It's cost kept me from giving a five star rating. You need this to clean and lubricate your razor when using Norelco's Jet Cleaning system. I usually buy the 2 pack and it lasts almost 2 years. It does a great job on maintaining the razor. I've had the same blades for over 4 years.
B004XJNSIK|5|Love the color.  Good value.
B001A9FQ2W|5|this is a great brush! dont have any doubts!
B000GGHRWW|1|I bought these because I would use a similar product to clean my mothers mouth in the hospital.  These ones were a disappointment and I ended up throwing them out.  While the sponge head is good, the paper wand is not.  As soon as it gets wet, it starts to fall apart.  The paper wand, or handle, simply breaks down and is unusable.  These really should use a plastic wand.    I suppose for really really light use these could work.  (Like, just a quick wipe, or perhaps just to moisten the mouth).  But for any oral thrush or general cleaning, it is not usable.
B004JP48B4|2|The gel was hard.  I couldn't get it on the brush.  I returned both of them to the seller. The end
B00OP20ZSG|1|I have been coloring my own hair for years, and I was curious and a little excited to hear about the unique two-step process, I thought I would create a more polished, professional result. Instead, after receiving the product and using it, my opinion changed. I thought it would have helped to have a friend do the back of my head, it was a little complicated to do the roots application in back. I got it all on and followed the instructions exactly, but the two-step process resulted in two-tone hair. I feel the two-step process was rather arduous and produced less favorable results than an easier, one-step color. I can say my hair did feel good afterward, so I may try one of the VS one step colors in the future. However, I would not use this product again. I am a Bzzagent and received this product free from Vidal Sassoon, but I will not let that affect the quality of my review.  #BzzAgent #VidalSassoon, #Salonist, #Sponsored #GotItFree
B001DYHMK8|3|I used the product as directed and am not experienced enough with a razor strop to fairly judge its effectiveness.  It seems expensive for what you get, but one container should last a long time.
B004T0YWV0|4|I replaced an old one I had that I loved. This new one is nice but not as nice as the old one.
B00267EGLE|1|this is just nail polish remover full strength. dont waste your money. cost less at the beauty supply store for 100% acetone.
B000NFEX46|5|I dislike the HB ATX with a passion. My HB sport was lost forever and this was the replacement. I'm thinking of a couple of more to have in backup since I don't see my hair growing back anytime soon.
B0092DDRI8|2|first, NOT a one size fits all. Will fit someone petite. Material is scratchy and when they shipped it, i had to use scissors to open it and the fabric was right up to the edges of the package and I cut it.
B00545UQ50|1|HAHAHA my bad for thinking that it would do anything
B002LE54P4|4|This face cream is light and absorb quickly.  Didn't see dramatic results yet, but my skins feels smooth.  The pump keeps it sanitary.
B00PZ04MYU|5|Really nice, has everything you need to take care of your lashes at a good price for the combo. If you're going to spend the money to get lash extensions you need to take care of them, it really extends their life.
B001P72HDU|5|First, I'm a huge Benefit fan and love all of their products.  Second, I love powder foundation that lets me choose between a light to medium touch.  This is the best one I've found.  Not only does it make me feel flawless but unlike most brands I've tried, Benefit offers a wide range of shades  for powder foundation.  most brands' \\"light\\" makes my cool-toned skin look unnaturally shallow but there's no other \\"light\\" shade!  I'm in love with this product!
B00NT0AR7E|5|Love, love, love this new serum!  The dispenser gives you just the right amount to cover your face.  My skin immediately began to feel firm.  I let it dry then put moisturizer over it.  The moisturizer seems to get absorbed better and together they work to make my complexion look good.  I then follow up with sunscreen and a light foundation.  My face feels firm and hydrated throughout the day.
B002D8K1F6|5|I love this product, it arrived 20days after ordering which was most satisfactory. Unfortunately it was poorly packaged ( in a bubble wrap envelope)and of course it leaked. I was surprised that Customs let it through as it was a very messy parcel. Just so we know for next time. Thank you and kind regards Beris.
B003ZWMD4Q|5|This size bottle is hard to come by these days.  Everything seems to be either 2,3 or 8 ounces.<br /><br />I wasn't sure how good the quality would be,when I placed the order; but I was pleasantly surprised.<br />These bottles are exactly as advertised - all three bottles are 4 ounces.  (The picture is a bit misleading).<br />They are a nice quality,and they spray a fine mist.<br />They arrived very quickly, packed in a small carton - so they were protected from being damaged.<br /><br />And at $1.99 for three, they are very reasonably priced.
B005V6YT5A|5|I bought this about a year ago for myself when I was having difficulty falling asleep. It truly does work, so I gave it as a gift for my son. Gotta check back with him to see if it's helped. I also use the pillow spray.
B00LNOKBYW|5|I have always had extremely straight hair and it is almost impossible to keep in a curl with heat curling. This curling iron is one of the few I have used where the curl actually stays in for more than a couple hours. It is super easy to use and I love that I don't end up burning my fingers.
B000FFI228|5|I have fairly curly hair, and this has been an amazing help. I never even bothered blow drying my hair before, since it always did what it wanted to, no matter what. Now it does what I want! Coworkers have asked me what I'm doing to make my hair look so much better.  <br /> <br />I don't find it to be heavy, nor has the attachment ever fallen off, as others have said. However, it does make my hair get pretty darn hot. I've never used a straightening iron, so I don't know if they do the same thing. I don't have very thick hair, but it only takes me about 10 mins from towel drying to done. <br /> <br />I recommend it, highly.
B00384HT90|4|They work, but can leave a little bit of a sticky film
B002RPJBIS|5|Very easy to use, and excellent for steaming your hair. Delivered within the given time period. Always wanted one of these.
B00NOAKUBM|5|Nice size, and good output.
B00M5DD8F4|1|Doesn't work at all like it's represented.
B007SBHO4Y|5|Perfect for fine hair and blondes! This adds so much moisture to your hair and makes growing your hair out so much easier. For young looking hair I give this 5 stars!
B001RPL902|4|I just received my Bellabe a few days ago. I washed my face thoroughly with cleanser and warm water. Then I used the Bellabe on my dry face. The pain was not that bad to me. It felt like some little pinpricks comparable to how threading would feel. On a scale of one to ten with 10 being the excruciating and 1 being barely noticeable. I would rate the pain I felt from the Bellabe as 4. It was completely bearable.<br /><br />I used the Bellabe to remove my upper lip hair and sideburns. It worked well, however, I did find going over the areas three times and I kept finding more hairs to pull. I also didn't have a shadow left on my upper lip as I did with shaving. That was the best part. One downside was that a two days later I broke out in fine little pimples on my cheek where I plucked out my sideburns. The bumps are barely noticeable unless you look really closely at my face. This is the same reaction my very sensitive skin has to tweezing and threading. So beware, if you have super sensitive skin.<br /><br />Overall, I would recommend the Bellabe for facial hair removal if you skin is too sensitive for hair removal creams (mine skin burns) or shaving leaves that spikey feeling and shadow.
B001AHS6CQ|5|I tried a sample of this at my salon.  Since the packaging was different, I was concerned that it might not be the same, but it works exactly the same.  My hair is softer and more manageable.
B003LW4LJK|5|I had to buy this razor to see what the talk was all about. I am knew to wet shaving, but have been using the Popular Feather razor and like it. But this bad boy is the SH!#, I recommend this razor to anyone who is looking to step up to a new DE razor. It shaves really good. Can't ask for nothing better especially for the price! Great seller as well.
B00GTAH4JU|5|Very Happy with my Purchase.  I will definitely use this seller in the future..
B002GYIICA|4|the only thing is that the product comes with an european language . no english at all...
B00EQ50L7C|2|First of all-  pay close attention to the sizes -- they are extremely small!  Yes, you are getting 4 products for your money, but the eye cream especially looks like a sample size.  I used them up very quickly.  I also don't think they're very effective.  I got it because Dr. Murad seems to be at the forefront of skincare with his Water Secret book, etc., so I thought I'd give his products a try. Also, I need something that is Anti-Aging and Anti-Acne as I'm mid-40s but still get pimples.  These products did nothing really to clear my skin and I actually got a few blind pimples while using them.  That is not completely unheard of for my skin but usually I'll just get one in a long while - I got 2 or 3 on this stuff, about one a week.  Sometimes people say if a product is really effective, your skin will get worse before it gets better because it is drawing out all the bad stuff from lower layers.  So maybe I didn't give this a long enough try.  But for these teeny tiny sizes, the cost is not worth it to me to try again.
B0006FKLXK|5|Best shampoo I have used.  I have been using it for 2 years, hair is filling in not thinning out.
B0083U9EW4|4|I love this stuff and usually buy it from my local hair girl. However, this particular bottle I decided to buy on Amazon. The bottle I bought from my hair girl I can leave the can on the sink and just push the top and the cream comes out. This bottle from Amazon I pushed and pushed and nothing was coming out. I took the lid off and there was plenty of cream in there, as I would expect there to be, since it was brand new. I wound up turning the bottle upside down, pumped a few times and out the cream came. I've only used it 2 or 3 times and have to turn it upside down each time to use it. When the first bottle I bought I didn't have to do that at all. So I don't know if it's missing a tube or something? Or maybe I need to buy a &#34;Hair Products Usage 101&#34; book or something. Maybe the first bottle I bought wasn't supposed to come out as easily as it did or perhaps this bottle was busted internally. (Which is why I gave 4 stars) but as far as the product itself goes. I really like it. Smells nice. My hair looks great and healthy. It's smooth and the cream is not sticky like gel would be.
B000M7YQOM|5|el producto es muy bueno<br />the product is very good
B00WJ2G8IA|5|High quality oil. Great value
B0023UTL7S|5|I have curly hair and I loved this product. The quantity was small but lasted me a long time. I loved the smell and it really did help my hair grow!
B00D2J39PE|5|Finally, I have a choice outside of black, beige, and white. These are awesome!
B00GG9I060|5|My sister is a hair dresser and even she thought it was great quality for fantastic price.
B000W33WMS|5|Haven't noticed a real change, only that there have been slight changes in the brightness of my under eye circles. Worth the money compared to overpriced eye creams though thus far.
B004NGW7E4|5|THANKS
B00N9D30T8|1|No problems with the ordering process or delivery, but I tried two of the heads before giving up. The first stopped spinning on the second use and the second one stopped within five uses. Worth a try, I guess.
B00CM2AQE4|5|This African Shea Butter is a great product. I usually have a beard, but needed to be clean shaven for a few weeks. I used this unrefined Shea Butter to help my face stay soft and moist. It was good to know that this was all natural Shea Butter and that there was no chemicals, fillers, or other impurities. It has a pleasant clean smell not a perfume type odor. I strongly recommend the product and this company.
B00C7PZ20O|5|I am always looking for great, whitening toothpaste, and this is one of the best. I feel like it cleans really deep - it leaves my teeth feeling refreshed and deep cleaned. Of course, my teeth (which are already pretty white) look even whiter, and it freshens breath. At night when brushing my teeth, my gums do become somewhat sensitive, but the sensitivity always goes away after I'm done brushing - no issues with the toothpaste otherwise.
B00GN0KXEE|5|Awesome cocoa butter! It smells just like it should and you can even rub it on your skin as is letting it melt to your body temperature!
B00GETFD1M|3|The perfume is good but for me I don't like at all but I'll recommend it maybe is me but its still good
B005ACKPM6|5|I'm an Asian who was seeking a hair dye that would actually do something for my hair. I bought this over the summer and I probably should've bleached my hair more but it had a pretty nice colour. I've had it dyed since last summer and I still find nice silver strands although some of it has washed out.
B006SFI058|5|Makes your hair feel really clean. Doesn't feel gritty
B003UZWF7S|5|Great product
B00HB2ARDU|5|thank you!
B00E19403Y|1|I have been using this as recommended for 4 weeks now and have seen no change in the skin tags at all.  I understand that it is supposed to take up to 8 weeks for the skin tags to be gone, but after this time there should be some visible change in the surface or texture.  They look and feel exactly the same as when I started.  Totally useless.
B00685KUGA|5|.Have skin fungus and was looking for something with anti fungal properties.  Heard that sulfur was good for the purpose.  Does not cure but helps to control the outbreaks.
B000C1Z8JK|5|I don't smoke TABACO but I sure like this perfume. It has such a fresh plant fragrance that it really feels as if you are in a tabaco plantation, I love it.
B0040BK082|1|I was excited to receive this product and use it, however, when it arrived, I put the bulbs in it, turned it on, and nothing happened! Broken. Had to return it. Very disappointed.
B003UBH7KC|5|I love this spray. I have very thin hair and when I apply this at the root, I get extra lift and body in my hair style.
B005RZDEMO|5|This is a quality product. I wasn't expecting too much in this razor but when I finally received it, I was very pleased. My only ding was that I should have bought the longer handle blade (same  style). It feels very small in my hand so I suggest you spend a little more money and invest in the longer handled razor. In all, it's still deserves 5 stars for the quality.
B002YLEQ2Q|5|the brush is so nice for my long eyelashes it really does make my eyes bigger my new favorite mascara
B006WM8FGG|5|Good price and convenient
B009GBDV96|5|Pretty
B00IJQDZTU|4|They are great!
B00APO2ZFY|4|This color is crazy!  It's very bright but it feels nice on your lips.  I'm not sure if it's worth the price, but it's definitely a nice add of color to your collection.  It looks nice on my complexion (honey-ish).
B001EUS62Y|3|I have very sensitive skin so I have to be careful about what products I use when I have breakouts on my body (notably my shoulders and back).  My dermatologists recommended that I try the Neutrogrena Body Clear Body Wash, Pink Grapefruit for when I broke out.  She was adamant that I did not use it on a daily basis because my sensitive skin and she is right! This body wash is great for when you breakout during the summer months- the salicylic acid treats your pimples.  It does so quickly and without much irritation to my sensitive skin.  However, I thought because it was rather gentle when I did breakout that I could use it on a daily basis- WRONG.  After using it for about 5 days in a row, my skin was extremely irritated and very dry.  I would recommend that sensitive skin people only use this product when they breakout or KNOW they are going to breakout, otherwise it will dry out your skin.
B00J2ODEJO|2|Rusted pretty quickly... and it's REALLY sharp. Like, crazy sharp. I know it's to cut the super tough fimo canes but be really careful when using this blade.
B00A6HYFWQ|3|the product was smaller than expected
B005XUNG5I|5|My feet feel so happy and look so good! This is so simple and easy to use. BEFORE USING THE CALLUS REMOVER,  BE SURE TO READ AND UNDERSTAND THE DIRECTIONS. Do not push down; a light touch makes it work. Only use it about 2 or 3 seconds on any spot or your foot will be sore.  I love this gadget and it is going to save me a lot of money since I won't have to get pedicures as often.
B003JN339K|5|I have struggled with dry, cracked heels for years. This is the only product I have ever found that softens and heals them.
B000P20R8I|5|Very good product quality, this is all I expected to get.<br />I recommend to other buyers those are thinking to buy that.
B00G23VSGE|4|It's a very nice hat, but I purchased this for my mother who is only 4'10&#34; tall and has a smaller head.  This doesn't fit her as she prefers so I can't speak to the quality as it's not getting used.
B008JWW5K4|1|Should not be labeled as professional. Pretty but low quality brushes. Two broke the first week of use. Brush hairs are too delicate also.
B00CP7M2RU|5|I have very sensitive skin, and do not like to try many new products because of it.  I first used the brush especially for sensitive skin, and it felt amazing.  It is very soft and gentle, but really exfoliates and invigorates the skin.  My face felt very refreshed and smooth afterwards.  I decided to do it again a few days later just to keep up with the dry skin yuckiness of winter, and again had great results.  Personally, I would only use this on my face once or twice per week.  I do not wear foundation or heavy make-up, so I don't really have a need to even try it daily.  I think it would be too much for my skin.  This works really well in the shower!  I prefer using it as my hair conditions and it can spray water/cleanser without me worrying about cleaning it up later (like I would at the sink).  The body brush exfoliates very well, also.  I've used it along my neck, instead of the sensitive skin attachment, and it does a great job.  Any rougher areas on the body, I'd recommend this larger brush.  I haven't tried the pumice stone yet, but my husband is curious about it because his heels get callused from work boots.  My only issues are:  I wish it came with a bag to store everything together - preferably something waterproof; I hear a sound on the inside when I switch it upside down/right side up, like there is a little piece of plastic moving around.  Broken piece, maybe?  Not sure.  It doesn't affect the way it works, just not sure what's going on;  lastly, just wish it had another speed option, as it only has one.  Overall, I would definitely recommend this unit to anyone looking to save money over the crazy priced brush system, plus this one has much better options!  I've read comments by the owner, and he seems very down to earth and ready to satisfy his customers, which makes me want to be one.  All about small business!  If you're on the fence, I'd go for it.
B00HTCBYGQ|4|A return was accepted. Partly, could be my speed reading but am not sure of that.But cosmetic<br />world has a different phrase wording, no?
B009SM3YS6|5|The sweetgrass has a wonderful smell and burns well. I use it for general room clearing and to make the room smell nice before meditation.
B00DELIUCW|5|Love love it !!!great for dull grey hair.<br />Puts the spring and shine back... seems so much smoother and full.<br />Best product I have tried for fine grey hair.
B00005309A|5|Great buy, packaged well. reasonably priced, when it is hard to find in my area. I like the quanity it came in.
B0002KHU3I|3|I must have gotten the wrong ones as the brush part was not soft as I ordered or they have changed as I've been using the same power part for 5 or 6 years.
B007KAYN2E|5|I have been  using Toppik and many other brand names of hair concealers over the years and was surprised to find a product that was half the price - I gave it a try and am so pleased - that product is Samson Dark Brown hair concealer and I am very impressed with the way it conceals where necessary.  I have ordered it many times and continue to do so.  The price is right and the product is just as good as the more popular, expensive brands.  Thank you Samson for making this available at a reasonable price.
B00113HNB4|5|my friends stole this from me.
B007MEOLHU|5|Love love love
B003CU26SY|5|First, I purchased this along with the extra dark JBCO about a wk ago. The lavender definitely masks the original smell of the roasting bean process....very pleasant scent.  I love how it feels on my scalp, the tingling of the lavender gives it a cooling sensation.  I really felt it when I was driving with my windows down...WOW!  It also puts you in a relax state as if you were getting a scalp/body massage.  Would definitely purchase again!  It is not as thick as my extra dark JBCO, but a little still goes a long way.  Applicator bottle recommended.  This is a must have to soothe the scalp and relax the mind.  LOVE IT!
B000L596FE|4|The last brush I was using for brushing my wet hair literally snapped in half but this was after several years of usage so I wasn't upset just surprised.  I was looking on Amazon for a new one when I came across these, after reading the reviews I decided to try and and have not been disappointed.  This is the best brush I've probably ever used.  I have medium length slightly curly hair that after getting highlighted can be very tangly.  This brush easily works through the tangles and snags without hurting.  My only concern is that some of the bristles are starting to bend already which is why I didn't give it 5 stars.
B0081MQ47C|5|Best investment !!! Save your gums and your teeth will love you :)))))
B000GHIBQM|5|My wife buys it every time it ends, so, try figure it out if she likes it or not! =D
B000PLUZL8|5|My pores, acne scars, and blemishes are significantly decreased with consistent use of this product once a week. I've  been using it for well  over 6 months now and this little bottle lasts a long time, considering you need very little of it.
B00OKJ1YW0|4|This concealer is great, although I wish it came with an application brush.
B002U7FPXI|5|The mineral colors are so SWEET!,, They help give shine when i am on stage and even work for day wear.. and when i wear them with KEEP IT ON ..i get out of control eye liners...    THe Fools GOLD Is the best eye shadow color i have ever used!...Love it[  [ASIN:B002U7BTW4 ShaBoom Products Drag Mineral Eye Dust, Silver Gray]][[ASIN:B002U7BU0A ShaBoom Products Drag Eye Stunners - Fool's Gold]]
B000C1VSR6|5|yes i love
B0000535B4|5|I buy this shampoo for my grandsons.It's tearless and it inexpensive enough that it doubles as a body wash. They smell so good when they get out of the shower!!
B00QBDGXME|5|I've been using this for almost two weeks now. It's been amazing! I've had constant breakouts on my neck and jaw line for months. Nothing has helped...until I started using this serum! It has nearly cleared up my breakouts using it once per day and the wrinkles on my neck seem to be less noticable. I'm excited to keep using this vitamin c serum to see how it can enhance my skin even more.<br /><br />I was given this product for free for review though BuView.com. All opinions are my own.
B0024JMXQY|5|Dec. 2015 - New review - I've changed my review from 4 stars to 5 stars because I no longer travel for business & the 10&#34; size is great for me to use in my home for applying my makeup.<br /><br />I had a 6&#34; magnifying mirror I carried with me when I traveled - necessary to put makeup on in hotels.  It broke so I ordered this mirror.  I'm very happy with the quality & the magnification - but the 10&#34; size does make it larger/bulkier to pack.  Would've been nice to have had one like this just smaller - maybe 6&#34; or 8&#34;.<br /><br />It would've gotten a 5 star rating if it had been a better size for me.
B008JWW5K4|1|Gets the job done but poorly made. Brush falling apart already. I wouldn't say it's professional, but more for practice.
B006H2Z5KK|5|I Love this image plate, I bought it because I wanted the big flower image, and it is awesome, all of the other images are cute too and they all pick up and work just fine for me :)
B000FP3EJY|5|Love use all the time.
B00009RF1E|5|I couldn't have asked for a better beard trimmer. It does not leave wild hair sticking out of my beard and i always cut mine on #2 to keep it short. The price was unbeatable with free shippng at the time. <br />                      robet paul JONES <br />
B002PF87L2|3|Although this spray went on light, I found that it later left my hair feeling stiff. I prefer the Living Proof brand.
B000Z602SO|5|I stock up on this scrub when it's on sale at Crabtree & Evelyn website,just got three of them at 75% off.I hope they will never stop making it.<br />It smells so good you will want to eat it :)<br />My routine is a little different.At wintertime soaps and body washes make my skin very dry and itchy. Before bath or shower I slather myself with jojoba or camelia oil. After that I need something mild enough not to strip oil off my skin but also not to leave me an oily mess.This scrub does great job without drying up my skin.Did i mention it smells great?!<br />I also appreciate ingredient list that I can actually read and understand.
B0089N2MO2|5|I purchased these items and after several months of use have seen significant improvements in my skin.  The items arrived as promised and on time.  I will definitely repurchase without hesitation.
B007Y6FINW|4|Great product in disposable packaging good for te environment and made to take up minimal space in suitcase. Many more products should be packaged like this!
B002Z635Z4|5|As far as I am concerned, I would not use anything else.  I have used the Microplane Foot File for years.  I have problem feet and it keeps them so smooth.  I still have my original.  I bought one for travel, and one for a gift.
B00BX70XB0|5|These are the best comb I have ever used. They stay in place all day!
B000UQKGOY|5|Great buy. I sold all of my lotion within the 1st hour of being at the farmers market
B000052XEG|5|This is the best eye makeup remover i can find out there. If you wear alot of eye makeup or eye shadow, this product takes it off quick. I usually use it while in the shower, it saves more time.
B001CS8BJ6|5|I got this item for my husband to keep in his car for the mornings that he either woke up late or forgot to shave, it works great for him and he has sensitive skin. I am so happy I made this purchase :)
B0049UYZ7Q|5|Great product, being a skin cancer patient and a lover of the outdoors and being in the sun, Sun Labs. product is outstanding.  Must admit was dubious at first due to the colour of the product but alas no yellow or orange colouring.  It is really a natural looking tan.  Really glad I got the 32 oz size my spouse decided to use it also, waited to see how it looked.  Other products made me look orange and my knees and elbows would look lousy but not with Sun Labs.  Being a Amazon prime member had it in two days again outstanding.
B004Y9H1QO|5|This was just a filler purchase but I love it. Thought I was just going to give to my daughter but keeping it all for me. Love the smell and smooth texture. It's like any other lip balm but a great filler purchase to get free shipping! :)
B00DVS8MX0|5|I brought the healthy hands cream, used it a couple days, and my thumb cracks cleared up. So, one night, while rubbing it on my hands, I looked down at my cracked heels. I know O'keefe has a foot cream, but I haven't found it yet, so I rubbed in some hand cream, it's been a week now, and my heels are still soft! So now I'm going to try the real heel cream. If it works as good as the hand cream, and I'm sure it will, it will be the only hand and foot cream I'll ever buy. The hand cream does make your hands slightly \\"sticky\\" but that just helps your grip.
B002YKDCKO|5|Excellent lotion for very dry skin, i love it
B00E87CO2I|5|This is as described arrived very fast from China and is perfect for nails.  You get a lot for what is charged.  Very Happy Customer!
B000ROGWLA|1|This was an expensive product, but according to the description I decided to order and looked forward to a product that would be far better than anything I had used in the past.  What a disappointment!  I am wondering who the people are that gave it such glowing references as it is no better than a cheap emery board, and the interesting thing is there is no way to return it!
B00R2L69EG|1|I was sent this toothpaste to try as part of a BzzAgent campaign, and as much as I really wanted to like it, it hurt my teeth.  Like EVERY other whitening product out there.  I liked that it had the two steps but like others, the taste was a turn off.  I wasn't able to use it past a couple uses because of the pain, so I couldn't tell you if it had an whitening affect at all.
B008U1Q4DI|5|i have used mine many times now i love all the colors thought they fall off easily if not put on right
B003XDVERE|5|It is all what it claims to be.It is the best Dental Tape/Floss I've ever used!You need NOT to have wide spaced teeth to use it.Unlike Floss,this TAPE is very gentle on once gums.
B00B0RHJB0|3|I used a trial size I received for free from Influenster as part of their VoxBox program. The product is okay. I think other products that cost less do a just as good, if not a better, job especially ones that do not have sulfates in them. I have very fine hair and it seemed to weigh it down quite a bit and left it feeling dry despite the fact it's &#34;moisturizing&#34;.
B00PGQALL6|5|Great product. I have lighter colored hair so I have to be careful with some pomades or I'll get a super greasy look that I don't always want. This pomade works great for my medium to long hair. Not too greasy looking so I've been able to use it everyday and it has just the hold I'm looking for. It provides good height without being as stiff as some of the super heavy hold pomades I've tried. Holds up well all day and easy to re comb if need be. Scooping out of the can it feels kinda like Murray's but in my opinion it's easier to work with than Murray's and holds better. Very pleased. The only thing I wish was for the scent to be a little stronger on the hair cause it smells pretty darn good.
B00BCQ2TOG|3|It cleans good, but I am use to a little bit of foaming action.  I seem to use more toothpaste when it doesn't foam.  Other than that, I really like the lemon flavor and the great cleaning job it does.  If you don't mind no foam it is a vey good tooth paste.
B00H57NTXG|5|I love this Sulfate Free soap . Great for everyone but especially those with dry skin conditions. Smells good. Last a long time.<br />I wish they made a shampoo too.
B003CY0QL4|4|Trimmer works as promised.  It does not have any bells or whistles, but it cuts evenly and is easy to disassemble for cleaning.
B003XU8ABA|3|A little too noisy, and vibrates a little too much. Otherwise, it works fine.
B003FVDNO6|5|I LOVE ALL TYPES OF HAIR PRODUCTS AND ITEMS AND THIS IS ONE OF THE BEST I HAVE FOUND IN A WHILE - IT REALLY WORKS. I HAVE VERY LONG THICK HAIR AND THE TWO SPIN PINS TURN INTO MY HAIR EASILY WITH NO PROBLEM AND STAY ALL DAY - GREAT INVENTION!!!
B000XI7070|2|I was disappointed in this product. I had to stop using it due to the dryness it was creating. It might be good for an ocassional deep cleansing but not for my color treated hair.
B004O24Q8W|5|New fragrance is very interesting and special for all men.<br />Gucci is still the best fragrance for me . Thank you
B00EY9AL34|5|I love how the caboole case opens upwards rather than opening sideways; this style will save room on my dresser.
B0062IBLSE|5|I love this toner! I've used it all up and tried something new (Etude House Wonder Pore) but I'm coming back to this. It's amazing for dry skin and really hydrates. It is oily so I wouldn't recommend this for oily skin and it'll probably feel really thick. But for those with really dry and sensitive skin, it works great! I use this to prep my skin for the rest of my routine.
B0085NUD74|3|I could only use a little bit of it because it was damaged but the taste was just so different, and not in a good way, from the cool mint.  I swear by the benefits of PerioBrite though!!  I had beginning stages of periodontal disease but after consistently using this with the PerioRInse I have seen a huge improvement, and use nothing else but Perio products. :-)
B003JA3KAK|3|Blindfolded, I don't think I could tell this conditioner from any other in that price range: the typical Tresemme, L'Oreal, Garnier, Finesse row at the drugstore.  It's a thick white lotion and while it promises radiance, I didn't notice anything different. I usually use Tresemme as the answer to my tangle problems (which are really a big problem for me).  It allows me to comb out in the shower and have no tangles.<br /><br />With this, I had a harder time combing out tangles. Once I did, and styled as usual, I didn't notice any special effects. I asked my husband if it looked shinier, but I don't think he'd notice any way.  To me, it did not increase shine.  It did nothing out of the ordinary.  As far as preserving color, that's another issue. If you were starting with fresh color, maybe. But mine is three weeks old and I will not know if it actually preserves my color until I try it longer (I will update review if somehow my color dramatically remains).<br /><br />If you can get this on sale, then it's a fine product. Just don't expect miracles. For what it's worth, I'm keeping my Tresemme.  In any case, I wouldn't be surprised if all those shampoos weren't the same underneath the colorful labels.  Few seem to do anything extraordinary.
B007M0KCLS|5|I will never get a salon manicure again, these are perfect. I always hated going to nail salons and worrying whether the equipment was sanitary, etc. And I really only want to wear my nails longer for special occasions, so these work out perfectly for that. I generally keep them on for 3 days although they seem like they could stay on longer. None has ever fallen off. But they are so easy to remove when I'm ready to remove them! Not like salon nails where you have to struggle with them to get them removed. I get a lot of compliments about how nice they look, no one would guess they're press-on.
B00MGA5K8O|3|I received my order like it said. Still getting used to the mask since I have never used one before. It is nice that it is adjustable since (1) not used to it and (2) my head does not feel like it is in a vice. My only problem is with ear plugs. I have small ear canals and they hurt my ears to have them in. I have to screw them in and they when they are in they put so much pressure that I'm in pain. Even hurts to get them out. So if you have bigger ear canals you wouldn't have a problem.
B00GMOXW80|5|Couldn't ask for anything better! More beautiful than in the picture! I would definitely recommend this to anyone looking for an urn for a loved one.
B002DMK0K8|5|I have dry skin, but this is absorbed quickly by my skin and the cream has such a wonderful but subtle rose scent.
B0048NYGDM|1|Too stiff for me I just misunderstood how the product would perform.  My hair needs a gentler product to make my style
B008YAV0A2|1|i wear fake eyelashes all the time but people can not tell that i am wearing them because they look somewhat natural. these eyelashes looked super fake. There was barely any lashes on they style 2. The style 1 could be worn to prom or a wedding but if someone where to look at you they would be able to tell they definitely are not you real lashes.
B008J7LNOS|5|Blown. Away.  I have never, ever worn a mascara that didn't end up under my eyes within an hour or two before now, no matter how much translucent powder and whatnot I use.  I have greasy eyelids and a squinty smile.  I smile a lot.  It's a deadly combo for mascara wearing.<br /><br />This gives a lovely, not-too-much lash with very little effort.  I get length, though not so much volume, and it doesn't clump much.  A once-over with a lash comb solves any small problems.  Before this, I thought I was anatomically incapable of wearing mascara.  This proves otherwise.<br /><br />A few notes: There is minor flaking, but it doesn't stick to the skin.  I see a flake or two, flick it off, and get on with the day.  I do notice some slight irritation, but I have very sensitive skin and eyes.  It's not enough to stop me from wearing it daily to work.
B0018UUXCQ|4|Packages are wonderful, they are bigger than most other brands, pretty bold glitters but too bright and bold.<br />These are one of 3 differnet brands I bought at the same time, and it's just the least favorate for me.<br />I give four star for the size.
B00HAFDXB6|5|This is a fantastic product that has lasted for years. It's actually the best foundation I have, as it offers complete coverage without looking cakey. The only reason I don't use it on a daily basis year-round is that it contains some ingredients that can't be classified as natural. The color is customizable ( you get two additional tubes, one white and one dark brown so that you can customize the color in th bottle and / or before application. Superb idea! It looks very natural, lasts all day and offers fantastic protection. My (naked) face is always very light  compared to my body during the summer because of how well this product protects from the sun ( I allow the rest of my body to tan for health and aesthetic reasons )  - highly recommended!
B002BWTW5E|1|I read other reviews and despite most being negative I assumed it was just people not following the directions, etc..Definitely not the case! No matter what I tried I could not get my coarse hair off! I did a test on my hand and I have normal/fine hairs on it and was able to get it off. But everywhere I have super coarse dark hair and it did not come off, just the wax! Yes it was a sticky mess while I was attempting waxing, but it was mostly taken off with oil. WASTE OF MONEY!
B0009XH6OG|4|cut pretty good
B000OV5PEG|3|I am all for some good exfoliation, but this is just too much. Anywhere other than my legs I have to be super gentle so that I don't scratch my skin. It's really not a pleasant bath bar. I'm reviewing the seaweed soap, not sure what the oatmeal is like, though they show on the same page. Wanted something natural with no parabens, but won't buy this again...
B000NG46MY|5|very pretty color. Loved my manicure for special occasion
B00N8YP92E|4|like the design and concept, I have used things like this in the past.  Received, quality is good, just have not installed and used it yet.
B00009RF1E|5|Purchased this to replace a Wahl beard/mustache trimmer that I had used for years.  Keeps it charge for a long time and provides a great trim
B00DWKRHNS|2|works great.
B009N5HWQI|4|The discs are good. Some discs arrived no clean i dont know why but are so good for fix with its. thanks.
B003UNQUDU|5|The best yet/miracle working!!!
B008OBUZ5W|5|Great value.  Love the variety!
B000C1W3C0|5|Not as long lasting as I would like but the fragrance is very pleasant and noticeable and I LIKE it very much.
B00527XM2E|1|I guess if you are considering surgery, or are curious as to what you may look like, these may help. Do not wear these in public though!! You can CLEARLY see these little patches on your eyes, I will not buy this product again.
B000DT7G2S|5|Believe it or not I purchased this perfume oil on the recommendation of another customer review. I ordered a Frankincense & Myrrh candle from Amazon by Yum Scents. It smells so beautiful that I ordered two more to burn during the holidays. Because I like the idea that Frankincense & Myrrh were two of the first three gifts of Christmas I decided to try the perfume oil. This oil smells just like the candle, but keep in mind that it is a spicy scent from the Orient and a tiny amount goes a long, long way. And it is a perfect scent to use during the cool weather months. Or very sparingly during warm weather. It is a generous bottle and you will enjoy using it for a long time to come.
B00LALMG3W|5|I used this item for about 2 weeks and so far I do enjoy the results I am getting. Its very thick which makes me think its working while I sleep. I felt good on my skin and I have noticed a difference in my texture and appearance.
B003AKZCPU|3|Purchased these to replace a pair I broke.  The do an OK job, but it is difficult for the blades to cut through thick, tough toenails.  I find it difficult to get a good grip on the handles--too narrow of a diameter and very slippery.  A rubber coating on the handles would be a big improvement
B002HOM7VW|1|these machines are only about good enough to hang on the wall for decoration purposes, they are heavy, dont stay tuned and ive had one short and scar my wife, the power supply that comes with this kit is also unreliable, it doesnt stay even close to where you set it, the numbers bounce all over the place, not a good kit, dont waste your money, it will make you out to be a crap artist.
B00D13IQ2M|3|I bought the Nude Beige, and the color is great. It doesn't go orangy or pasty after wear, or turn out &#34;cakey&#34; in texture. I did find a little heavy compared to L'Oreal Paris' other foundations, especially Magic Nude and Visible Lift Liquid. If you like a lighter feel, try the liquid Visible Lift instead.  I didn't notice that it made much difference in &#34;de-aging&#34; my face.  It didn't really &#34;repair&#34; wrinkles or under-eye lines, although it does give good coverage.  I found the Visible Lift liquid foundation did a better job of filling in lines and wrinkles and making them less noticeable (for the record, I'm 51).  It's a good, basic foundation, but the performance for me was strictly average.
B00ER9MK26|5|This perfume is great for summer, spring and fall. It's very summer sexy to me. It's not a strong perfume which is what I love about it. The bottle is very pretty. I love to collect perfume bottles. This one is worth collecting.
B00609D92Q|5|I have had this facial at salons and now I can do it myself.  Real easy and great results.  Also, refreshing.
B0042NUGJ6|5|This oil leaves your my hair soft and shiny and genuinely makes my hair dry faster.  Not &#34;oily&#34; feel.  Ideal to tame the tresses.
B000YJ2SKM|3|It is ok but does't work well.
B00021B5ZQ|5|I love the Delux brand and was very excited to try this out as I read so many reviews in the magazines. This wand has lip gloss on one side and blush on the other. I have this in Flirty Berry.  The blush part looks tan but it goes on more pinkish and is very natural looking.  It was easy to dot on my cheeks and blend. The gloss part is very nice and has a pretty berry color and looks great on my lips. The gloss is not sticky or tacky. I will definitely buy this again.
B0060GTUEK|4|Yes they do stick just fine, remove them slowly. They are like thick, little bandaids. They do work but of course, once removed the lines will slowly reappear. I found using them whilst i sleep overnight promotes the best results - a kind of temporary, mini facelift. I would like the Frownie to be infused with some kind of serum but until then, clean your face, apply your favorite serum, let dry, then apply the Frownie for best results.
B001NH6ZVW|5|I like metallic polishes for easy application and coverage.<br />This is dark midnight blue with Deep greenish finish.<br />Perfect cool look.
B00AX3YNPC|5|This is the best! I love it and I am a happy customer!
B000F0GNT2|5|I had bought this product from a recommendation of a few friends. I am usually very careful with what I do on my face because my skin is very sensitive and I tend to break out very easily from things. I also have started taking a lot more care of my skin and investing into my routine.<br />For some background, I had an acne problem, nothing severe but after using Proactiv, it cleared up. I took a break, stopped using it, and my acne came back, not as bad, but I would get a new bump or white head usually every morning and I had to be careful from what foundation I put on to lotions, etc.<br />When I started using Proactiv again, things cleared up, but not as well as the first time. I wanted something a little extra to get rid of the stubborn spots of acne.<br />Now the dermanew comes in....<br /><br />I have been using it for several weeks now. The first 5 nights every night then a 5 day break then every other day.. I have to say that my skin is definitely smoother, more glowing and radiant, and my problem spots (my hairline and right underneath my jaw bone) have started clearing up. I was afraid that the product would irritate my skin and  make the breakouts worse, but this isn't true. It's a very gentle scrub for something that makes your skin so radiant. Reading a lot of reviews, I've seen that people were disappointed because they were expecting a whole new face it sounds like. The first time you use this, your skin is smoother, but it's not so dramatic. However, after 3 days, it is. I would have been happy with these results after 2 weeks, but with 3 days, I was ecstatic.<br />I am still using my proactiv in the morning and I use the dermanew at night. I usually cleanse my skin with the proactiv wash with the brush side and dry my face then I use the microdermabrasion creme and the buffing side. Following this, I use this product by H2O called calming complexion serum, it has salicylic acid in it. In the morning, I've begun using the brush side with the proactivwash and then follow with their 2 step system.<br /><br />I think at this price Amazon is offering, it is definitely a must have for your skin care routine. I've even noticed that they have an acne version of the creme and I have ordered that to try it out!<br /><br />I would recommend this for anyone with any type of skin! It is THAT gentle but you get results as if you buffed your face for hours.<br /><br />Another thing is that I noticed a lot of reviews say their pads have gotten bad after a few uses. I really don't know how that happens. They must be buffing for hours on end or pushing really hard on it. Mine are still perfectly fine and usable after all this time.<br /><br />If you are fed up with stubborn spots and just want a nicer complexion, I recommend this. It is a really nice addition to my skin care routine!<br /><br />Good luck!!
B005THOQL8|5|It was great for it being a 80$ item and get if 25$!! Also it came fast no damage and i was very inpressed!! If you are going to buy this perfume set i would go with seller! thank you so much my mom loves it!!:)
B004I4SZSI|5|Works great
B007T79TCM|5|This bottle works perfectly fine but the only thing is i got a little confused and i thought i was going to get 2 bottles like it shows on the picture but you only get one you choose if large or small
B003B3A9K4|1|Thinking it would provide the relief I was so desperately seeking, I ordered this product with great excitement.  Unfortunately, for ME it was a bust.  I would compare it to throwing a cup of water on a house fire!  There are so many products out there that claim to help, but prove to be a disappointment.
B00SJZMYIY|5|I have used many eye creams and gels and this is a good one.  I have used it for about 1 month and have been happy with the results.  Reduces puffy tired eyes and reduces the look of fine lines and wrinkles.  I will buy again great price for product.
B007VDUKT0|1|A friend of mine got sucked into the pyramid scheme.  Had me try a bottle for 6 days.  Told me to take before and after pictures to see results. Didn't see a change in the wrinkles around my eyes.  Tried it for 2 months.  No change.  The scent of this lotion is just terrible!  Had to spray perfume on my face to try to mask the smell.  I couldn't put my finger on it until I cleaned out my fruit bin in my refrigerator.  I had a melon that was starting to decay.  I heaved and then realized that this awful smell smells like Nerium!  So it smells bad, does not work, and its too expensive.  $100 is more than my cell phone bill  a month!  Cancelled online.  All hype!  I'd rather get botox or have my doctor prescribe Retin A.
B0009QZXP2|5|Is it good for hair color ?
B000ICRDSW|5|takes time, but boy, it does get rid of wrinkles, and really smoothes the deep ones somewhat.  Like it a lot
B00AE93VJE|4|This was one of the first shine sprays that I thought really, really made my hair shiny.  It made my low lights look like glass and my whole head of hair (which can tend to look a bit frizzy) looked and felt smooth as silk - the best I've used.  HOWEVER...and this is a big &#34;but&#34;....the difference between &#34;Wow&#34; and &#34;Yuck&#34; is a very, very fine line.  It is extremely easy to use too much and then you're faced with hair that looks greasy and you'll want to wash it...and the amount needed to accomplish the job without overdoing it can vary from one time to the next.  Bottom line:  I like having this product in my arsenal but I don't use it all the time....one last note worth mentioning -- even if you think you've put too much on and you think your hair just looks greasy....wait a good hour or more...fluff up your hair with your hands on-and-off and you'll find at least 1/2 the time the product has dissipated enough to not warrant you starting over.
B0014YYTEO|5|Exactly as stated!
B00L20500W|4|The doll is wonderful. I just got mine today and I can't stop playing with it. Just a heads up the hair is like a dark brown/red color. It was not the color I was expecting but I think the color it is, is pretty.
B00075EM3E|2|Pros: Holds quite a lot of urine. Doesn't make annoying splashing against plastic noise when urinating through the green anti-reflux tube. Easy to empty through rear spout.<br /><br />Cons: Urine leaks profusely through both the front green anti-reflux cap and the rear red child-proof safety cap. I threw away the red child-proof cap and am using the white spout cap, which does not leak. The unit continues to leak through the green anti-reflux cap if tilted in that direction.<br /><br />This unit is slightly more desirable than a cheap plastic unit with a snap on cover, but not by much. Test it for leaks before you trust it. I learned the hard way by spilling urine all over myself and my bed.
B00JCTCYJ0|2|bad quality hair unless wet. Sheds alot it also gets tangled easily and mats up. It sheds without you even brushing out tangled areas. The clips are not sturdy and does not hold the wig down to head. the wig doesnt fit properly. It is not worth 177 and will not last past one month. Not pleased
B005MIFD3O|3|It was great in taking care of my dry hair, but after repeated use I noticed I my hair felt greasy. Good for use between regular shampoos.
B004DGM2B2|4|These are great for that extra teeth cleaning that we all need.  I like these brushes and got them here because they have subscribe and save.
B00LMIJNUW|5|I have tried many hair products but this one was by far the best. I use it after washing and air drying my hair for 20 minutes, and it really helps with frizz and dryness. Shipping was on time. Recommended!
B004Y9D90Q|5|Good little trial size (or travel kit)
B000VUWX7C|5|Don't know if the product is useful but what a funny gift for an old guy.  Should create a few chuckles when opened
B00CJ01QT8|3|Not really sure it has moisturizing properties.  Using it a few days now,and finding I am still using an OTC moisturizer to feel any difference.  Let you know after a few more weeks.
B007RF1YZG|3|I dread using these, as they melt in your mouth and taste pretty gnarly. But they do work IF you are persistent.
B001A40M1M|5|Works just as they said .  Actually sticks to my cheek or gums . Keeps my mouth moist for a couple of hours and the price is right .
B003YJAZZ4|5|Using it for over a year now as a daily shaver...  If I let it grow out, I just turn up the setting...
B001IDZMGK|5|This is a really good shaver. I have sensitive skin and if I make sure to keep the blades clean it doesn't irritate my skin.
B00IVGN00W|5|This is an amazing deal! The scent was wonderful! Plus, it only took a couple of days for delivery.
B002N5MI2S|4|Took a chance on this.  I'd previously been using American Crew's Fiber product. This one costs less and does just as good of a job.  The smell is good - light fragrance.  I keep my hair really short - less than an inch on top and barely enough to pinch on the sides and back - so a little of this goes a long way, for a long time. This product is like a waxy cream rather than a clear gel.  If I accidentally use too much in my hair you can feel it, but most of the time that's not a problem.  Also, it washes out pretty easily since it's water soluble.  All in all, a good product.
B001GQ3GEY|1|I am an old man so when I seen this trimmer with all the attachment I thought you just pulled off one head and put on the next. I did not know you had to take the trimmer head apart to insert the next head. I guess if I were younger with time on my hand I could take a screwdriver and take the trimmer apart put on the head I wanted than put it back the way it was. I hope this help.
B008195FGG|1|Does not tease hair well.
B00147Z7R4|2|I highly recommend this brands products, but should've bought the 10% instead. I can only keep the 15% in for 3.5-4 hours, which isn't really a night's sleep and the lower end of the timeframe I anticipated with the 15%.<br /><br />So once I start to feel them sting my gums, I immediately wake up and take them out, which has been roughly ~3.5-4 hours after putting it on my teeth (using a retainer).
B00LXL2YN6|3|Good collections but overpriced!
B00UD2HXAK|1|broken eye shadows
B000G666HE|5|Exactly what I wanted...easy to assemble and good quality makeup mirror. I am very pleased and recommend it to couple of friends ,thank you !
B003PZLIH6|5|You will LOVE this pink! Someone told me it looked Barbie pink, and I took that as a compliment because that's exactly what I was going for :)  This pink is not on the neon side, more on the bright baby pink side.  Love this polish and will purchase a second bottle!  Quick shipping also!
B00DYOT7XA|5|This is a beautiful gloss. The color and shine are very nice and the gloss has a moisturizing versus a sticky feel when it's on your lips.  Will definitely be purchasing again.
B00AHF1GTM|5|I got a free sample of these disposable razors from BzzAgent and I love them! I can actually skip a day between shaving and my legs stay smooth.I won't use any other disposable razor.
B003I49IMG|4|The ones I bought were in the same containers, were very thin, and were fine for about 12 hours. Longer than that, they did sometimes fall apart. But they certainly did the job, were comfortable to wear, and were easy to insert and remove. I'm definitely buying more of them.
B000UQET1U|2|The brush bristles are a little on the sharp side.  I think they could have been blunted a little more.  Unfortunately I can't use it.
B00IJJDYTI|5|This is the only SPF product that doesn't make my skin itch, so points just for that. Beyond that, you just can't get a better moisturizer than CeraVe. It's loaded with hyaluronic acid and ceramides, which help to restore your skin's barrier function. If you have dry, sensitive skin and need some sun protection, this is the magic bullet you've been searching for.
B005XQAPG0|5|I purchased this tattoo kit as a Christmas gift. It was ordered, shipped and received in 5 days. The kit included everything that was mention in the description. The kit was very well packaged. Thank you for such prompt service during this Holiday Season.
B001ET7LGC|1|I can't  believe all these positive reviews. This brush is very course for baby's head. Bristles are poor quality as well.<br /> I returned it.
B00392A55Q|1|When I received my order I was thrilled!  Until I opened the package! I ordered three of the Milani shadows, and two of them were fine! This one was awful! The tamper seal had been pulled away from the container, and a very large gouge run across the entire pot. And this must be a knock off of Milani, as it came with a very cheap thin foam applicator that was visibly used! Immediately emailed the seller, and have yet to receive any response!  Dont know what I was thinking!  I should have known better.  This one is on its way to the trash can and half afraid to even use the other two! Hope others get a better product and experience!
B000FDXWEI|5|After recent hip surgery I need help reaching things.  I have tried several grabbers, and this is by far the best for me.  It is accurate enough to pick up a small pill dropped on the floor, and strong enough to push the \\"on\\" button of my computer down near the floor.
B00CX9EXOA|5|Went out looking for an electric razor and talked myself into getting one of these.<br />First I'm not gonna lie, yes the first time did sting without a doubt. But lets be honest girls, you can't tell me dancing all night in 4 inch heels is comfy either.<br />Anyway, now it's no big deal and i don't have to worry about my legs for at least a month at a time.<br />Granted, everyone's hair is different but i would say i have normal thickness of hair.  When stubble does start to show it is super fine which makes me think that is why it doesn't hurt so bad now.  It takes longer to use than a regular electric razor so sometimes i will use a disposable to neaten things up until i have time to devote.  Also there are &#34;areas&#34; that i absolutely haven't been able to use it on but for the legs it's great.  Have also used it on lower arms and (being a close-to-fifty year old woman) have used it on a few facial areas as well.<br />Bottom line:  LOVE it, so glad I got it and when it dies I will buy another one.<br />I got it at Walmart for about 29.00 so for the price it's worth a try.  Not having to shave my legs every 4-5 days makes me happy.
B001BO0KMC|5|AWESOME! Love this iron with turbo boost. I would reccomend this product.
B0047OT7Y0|1|So I go on line to make an appointment for later in the day. First I have to sign in, I have no idea what my password is, so I have to change it. The schedule pops up, with the times available for the different barbers. But there is nothing for the today. I don't mean that there are no appointments for the today, I mean that there is no schedule to make an appointment.<br /><br />So i call the number on the website, now bear in mind that it is 9 am,  the store has not even opened. I am told that they do not take appointments for the same day, but that I could just walk in. I know from previous visits that this is not a good idea, they don't have a lot of barbers working, you could easily wait for a long time.<br /><br />So I call the store when they are open, and tell them that I would like to come in around two, do they have any openings, same story... no same day appointments. When I enquired the reasoning behind this policy, Adam \\"explained\\" that if I i made an appointment for two ,and a guy came in five minutes before me then he would have to put me in front of him, and \\"who are you?' , yes, he actually said that... \\"who are you\\". I told him that I am the guy who made the appointment, that's who.<br /><br />Can someone enlighten me? If I call a restaurant at 1:30, and ask them if they have a table at 2, they can say yes, or they can say no. It seems that there is either an appointment available or there isn't. Am I missing something?<br /><br />There are like 100 other barbers in LA, I'm sure that I will have no trouble finding one that understands the basic systems for making appointments, It's a haircut, not brain surgery. When I want a root beer, I'll go to the supermarket.<br /><br />Support companies who support their customers. Don't buy from Bolt.
B00FU5LQUI|5|Excellent time on delivery and great moisturizing cream.  The best I've ever tried.  Thank you.
B004AK2VZ8|5|very natural ,soft i really recommend is excellent i love this
B008GOR6O0|1|You know I read the comments about the product and choose to buy it anyways so really its my fault. I wanted to practice blending with different skin tones but I didn't want to pay a lot. And it smells horrible, its very oily. I broke out within an hr of putting it on my face. And where I did a &#34;test sweep&#34; on my arm to match skin tone I even got an infected pore. And I hardly ever break out anymore. So buy at your own risk. I wasn't going to use on other people. I threw it away.
B005LR8KY0|1|Ordered through Living Social. Very disappointing - no result. What is worse, it causes breakouts. I don't notice any bad smell, however, even when using a tiny bit, this cream leaves a film on skin.<br />By the way, I tried posting comments on their web-site - they never got posted. If you see reviews on their web-site, they are all positive. Makes you think about the validity of their reviews, right?
B004ON2HUA|3|The serum is good but the bottle leaks out and there isn't alot of it to begin with.
B00NCMR4X4|5|These are the greatest things for keeping my skin clear. My teenage daughters and I use them on a daily basis and wouldn't use anything else. They are strong enough to keep the skin clear, but gentle enough on my sensitive skin. Love these!
B0009F79EQ|3|H2Ocean definitely works, but I can't say it works better than any other sterile saline solution. Before I bought this I was using wound wash from CVS, and it really did the same thing for half the cost for double the solution. H2Ocean is very expensive, and there are much cheaper alternatives that work just as well
B0009OAHJ6|5|This is a perfume that you want to use sparingly. It is long lasting and gives a unique aroma -- but you have to be careful as it tends to be overpowering if used too heavily. The spray and walk-through technique works fine for me.
B004K9UAKM|3|The Shea butter was harder then I expected. I end up giving it away.
B0045IZ9Z4|5|I love these; however, I'm concerned about bacteria growing.  I haven't seen any information about cleaning, but feel this is very important.
