B0036TGSJ4|5.0|I quite simply love this movie. Spunky and sarcastic and awkwardly sexual. Just like real life. At least it is if you're me.
B007XKEY6Q|1.0|Remember when you were young and you got to do or see something new and exciting?  This game gives you just enough a taste or view to say um man I'd like to try that again.  Just to have it become illegal the next day after you spent your hard earned allowance on it to enjoy it to the fullest.  I've done a hard reset,  a complete wipe, removed and reinstalled this app to the point of exhaustion for it to still immediately shut down upon opening.  Never thought I 'd see the day a company is allowed or even wants to continually sell a faulty product to the public knowing full and well for quite a while now through other reviews that its jacked up.  Welcome to the even crappier Y generation.  Appearantly anything goes now........Go Go Go!!!!!!  AND DONT BUY OR DOWNLOAD THIS.
B002ZG99A4|5.0|This one is worth watching at least once. Some great humor. Some great action. A decent plot line. Overall, a good movie for when you dont know what you want to watch.
B0031RS2HC|4.0|An entertaining read that kept the reader interested and engrossed in an action based adventure. Would recommend as good holiday reading.
B009T3AE1Y|5.0|Know this going in: this is not \\"entertainment\\" in the simplistic products that Hollywood delivers.  You'll probably need to watch it twice, or view the insightful director's commentary, or read the original DeLillo novel to understand some of it, and you will still be thinking about it months afterwards.<br /><br />I like one reviewer's idea of playing the DVD in the background, letting the philosophical ideas seep into your brain.  Some may argue it should have been a stage play: at least then the audience would be prepared for the challenging dialogue and claustrophobic atmosphere.  But I hope this finds a wider audience this way, at the risk of nonsensical \\"boring\\" reviews by unsuspecting and unprepared viewers.<br /><br />There are many uncomfortable moments and truths about today's society explored and where we may be headed as a species.  Cronenberg continues his uncompromising analysis of the modern human, with Eric Packer representing the frightening pinnacle of success and Benno Levin the confused and angry worker left behind -- both haunted by the final words \\"I wanted you to save me.\\"
B007SGM084|5.0|Was great, loved the book. it w as difficult to put down, good story line as well as &#34;action&#34; lol
B00785P2QC|1.0|I played this game a few times.  The first two times I got really far in the game and spent a lot of money on it before it just stopped working (said I didn't have enough City credits to buy anything.  I had 42,000,000).  Even called support the second time (about six months ago) and they didn't know why this was happening, they were working on it, they would get back to me and asked me not to delete it.  (They didn't offer to give ANY of my money back.)  That was over six months ago and still haven't gotten back to me.  I did delete it.  Seeing it has been a long time, I figured they had MAYBE fixed it and installed it again a few days ago (with the thought of putting NO money on it seeing I already had spent $100s on it.)  I got to the point of putting liked on facebook for some &quot;points, &quot; and it threw me out without saving anything I had done today on it.  It was stupid of me to put all my work back in and try it a second time, to have the same thing happen.  I do not know how this game got so many stars because it seems to me to be a money getting trap from G5.
B00846REIS|5.0|It was a great read, I really enjoyed it, couldn't put it down, it did remind me somewhat of Fifty Shades
B005LAIHQS|5.0|It was a very clean and funny and sad movie all should watch and find out what happens to Mib
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I liked this book also, didn't want to put it down, waiting for book three in May will be tough
B000020617|5.0|We love all the tracks on this cd!  I would recommend this to any Foo fan, and if you are not yet a fan, I dare say this would convert you!
B007J4T2G8|4.0|I loved it except the author used the word murmur too many times. Besides that, it was beautiful and different.
B000002H2H|5.0|This is a great cd and has the true 100% Metallica tracks we know and love!!  I would totally recommend this cd to anyone who really wants to Rock!  Metallica Rulz!!
0062124293|5.0|I literally laughed so hard I cried at several different points throughout this book. I was impressed throughout with Moran's perspective, wit, and excellent POV on all things lady-related. The word &#34;feminist&#34; can have oddly dour associations; read this book to dispel them.
B0009HLDFU|5.0|This is yet another great cd from Foo Fighters!  Dave Grohl has awesome voice and this is a great Foo for anyone.  I would greatly recommend it!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Great story. Can hardly wait to get the next one. Loved the characters and the storyline. Can definitely see why the books are so popular.
B0000CAXID|5.0|This is a great Foo Fighters cd.  My daughter and I Love it.  It has great tracks on it.  I would recommend this cd to anyone who loves Foo Fighters!
B0018TLRTU|5.0|Bueno como siempre y las dos &uacute;ltimas canciones son muy muy buenas, me encantan, muy ca&ntilde;eras, Billy es la hostia, muy bueno,
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|Great to play - recommended to me by a co-worker.  I tried it and I am hooked!  I even have my husband playing it!
0307463745|5.0|To me it's the Apple style for small business.<br />It's been very helpful in my carrer. I created a small but successful company based on this and the Getting Real book.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Excellent book! I can't wait to start book three, I still have yet to see the first movie.  Very well written.
1419705849|5.0|Time to celebrate: Greg Heffley has returned with more hysterical antics! We might be wishing Greg had started keeping a journal earlier in his life. It turns out, we're not alone. Greg believes that the person who will be writing his biography one day will have a lot of questions about Greg's life before middle school. Luckily, Greg remembers back a ways...like to the time he was swimming around in the dark, waiting to be born. Those were good times, with Greg doing backflips and napping, until his mother decided to hook up some music to her belly. Her belly speakers also had a microphone, which led to his mother telling tiny Greg all about her life. When Dad gets in on the action, he contributes a detailed account of his (extremely boring) work day. When Greg hits middle school and there's a quiz on OLIVER TWIST, he wishes he had paid attention in those pre-birth days when Mom read classic books to her belly.<br /><br />Poor, poor Greg. As the second son, he had to endure many hand-me-downs. If you check out the label in his underwear, you can see Rodrick's name crossed out and Greg's name penned in. But at one time, he even ended up with his big brother's pacifier plunked from Rodrick's mouth directly into Greg's (at least according to Greg. I wonder what his mom would have to say about that story?)<br /><br />Getting a little older did not improve Greg's family situation. Baby Manny came along, and no one ever found the blackened stub from his belly button after it fell off. Greg is still looking for that little item, which explains why he picks through his food before actually eating it.<br /><br />However, all of the backstory of Greg's life is simply leading up to the important events of his current adventures as a middle-schooler. For example: His plan for world domination...or at least school domination. His attempts to use his best friend, Rowley, as a political pawn kind of succeeds, but nothing stops the students' political unrest, which happens to be centered on toilet paper. This toilet paper turmoil leads to Greg setting up a secret stash of T.P. in a boys' stall, which he manages to turn into a cozy little hideaway for himself (at least, temporarily). Meanwhile, students are bringing in so much toilet paper that they can't fit it all into their lockers and have to tote it around. This leads to toilet paper fights and the principal announcing each student can only bring in five squares a day. Of course, some students start smuggling in extra, so the teachers must check their backpacks every morning for double-ply contraband.<br /><br />The Toilet Paper Problem is nothing compared to Greg's next huge middle school hurdle: the Valentine's Day dance. At first, the boys don't care about the dance, but when Candy Gram invitations to the event start arriving for the most popular boy, all of them are dying to receive one, including Greg. He gets some pointers from his slacker, mooching-off-the-family Uncle Gary, which leads to Greg receiving multiple Candy Grams, although none are exactly from the girl he hopes would send him one. Undaunted, Greg tries multiple schemes to attain a date. These efforts backfire, leaving Greg chagrined and his readers just plain grinning, if not actually laughing out loud.<br /><br />I keep waiting for author Jeff Kinney to run out of creative ways to situate Greg in hilarious situations to no avail. Thankfully, the man appears to be a never-ending fount of wacky but ridiculously funny plot points accompanied by the perfect illustration notions.  In fact, I think THE THIRD WHEEL is the funniest book in the series (but then, I always seem to think the most current Diary of a Wimpy Kid is the epitome of sidesplitting). This is another absolute winner, with situations any kid (or used-to-be-kid) can relate to or be truly grateful he/she dodged.<br /><br />Reviewed by Terry Miller Shannon
B006ZDS7CE|5.0|Brilliant, hypnotizing, beautiful, You won't be able to stop listening after you hear even just one song of this amazing album.
B005LAII80|5.0|Dredd was one of the best action movies which surprised me with the story line and acting.  Flows from beginning to end.  3D action was fantastic.
159413586X|5.0|Again I say that the movie followed right along with this series of books.  They were great and full of action.
B002ZG999U|5.0|I rated this 5 stars because this is an awesome movie first of all! Good price, arrived on time, and was in great condition! This movie has so many stars in it and is all of the war/action/kick a** heroes from my childhood in it! Good action movie would recommend!
0439023491|5.0|These books follow right along with the movie and were quite enjoyable.  I read the whole series before seeing the movie so I could judge them both fairly.

B009MF5BXK|5.0|If you loved the first Expendables you will love the second! More action/war/hero/ a** kickers in this one! Arrived on time, got it for a good price, and a must for the collection!
B0068LYEHA|1.0|Why young people today use such foul language is beyond me.  I stopped reading because the language was very offensive.  The story line was pretty good, but I regret spending my money and time on such trash.
0452285186|5.0|Bought this as a prank gift for adults Christmas party, was very funny watching the guy open this gift! An even funnier watching his reactions while reading the book! Very hilarious and inventive comic! Arrived on time and was a cute little book to have!

B00AMBH70S|5.0|Great action movie, can't understand why it didn't get such good reviews.  Jeremy Renner was awesome and I would recommend this movie.
B00A77II0U|5.0|loved the story line! kept me interested in the game. couldn't stop till it was finished. was well worth the 2.99 in my opinion :-)
B004HX4RT6|5.0|Didn't expect much from any chess app, but this one is certainly good enough for on the go games and I was surprised at the competitiveness of the matches.
076790592X|5.0|It is a book that was hard to put down once I began reading it. Very touching and moving, really stirred my emotions.
B00APUQT7I|5.0|From the Ice Age franchise we expect lots and lots of family fun and once again we are not disappointed! This movie was a riot! Great story Line! The kids and adults loved it! I think I might have enjoyed this one best of all! The beginning of the movie when the continents break apart was very exciting! The new characters were lots of fun and of course, Sid is still the funniest one! Would definitely recommend this movie!!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book is full of imagination and never ending excitement...I loved all the details felt like I was right there.
8866131121|5.0|I Have always gotten the weekly before but decided to try the daily and use as a journal/planner.  It is bulkier but I'm getting used to it and there's plenty of room when I need it for the days events and thoughts.
B004NBZG06|5.0|One of my favourite Georgett Heyer novels - accurate for the period in which it is set, well written and extrememly amusing.  An excellent choice for light reading.
B005EHQGTS|2.0|At this point I'm sorry I spent the $8.99 for this product.  I'm trying to use it so I can view my desktop computer at work and I can't get a connection.  When I go to the help screen it doesn't answer my problem.  Looks like I'm going to have to spend more money getting my IT guy to help me or just uninstall the app and give up.  I was really looking forward to a HD view.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|The story was really good with a little twist that I didn't see coming. I liked the characters and couldn't put it down til I found out what happened.
B00000IUKQ|4.0|love that the part of the bridge that goes over the tract and has the tunnel cut out for the train to go over is one solid piece.  Some other brands have that part of the bridge as two pieces and the bridge is always collapsing.  what i don't like is the round plastic pieces that connect it to the rest of the train tract.  If you're going to make a wooden train track make it all wood please.  A friend of ours has this bridge and she's already lost one of the plastic round pieces that connects it to the rest of the track.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I'm not usually one to reread books.... but I've read this one about 3 times and I cry every time. It's so emotional and just all around PERFECTION. favorite book forever and always.
B00095NX9G|5.0|After about a year of basic belly dance instruction, I wanted to bring up my skills to the next level.  This DVD provides enough of a challenge to keep me moving forward.  Also excellent yoga workouts and instruction for back bends.
B000FCK42M|5.0|The Power of the Dog is a thought-provoking look at both sides of the border and several sides of the drug trafficking business.
B002WY65W4|5.0|This movie is one of my favorite movies of all time! The best cameo ever! Everything about this movie was just excellent.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Gillian Flynn avoids the predictability trap and delivers a first-rate page-turner. I'm looking forward to reading more from this author.
B005G4TJUC|5.0|Late review, but still a great transaction.  Good movie and great playback too.
145210655X|5.0|My son & his wife are expecting a boy.  When they told us they were naming him Luke, well, the Star Wars jokes started. A coworker told me about this book.  When I saw  it I knew I had to get it for my Son.  This is a perfect book for new dads.  It pokes fun at some of the pitfalls of parenting. Great! ...even if they aren't name him Luke.
B008476HBM|5.0|This is a classic book of<br />Literature that demonstrates the tenacious plight of a 19th century heroine determined to not settle for anything other than true love. This demonstrates the helpless nature of women in a society dominated by men. Jane Austin is masterful in her craft.
1427210241|5.0|Love the book, I am in chapter 3 and love it. I think Brandon Sanderson has done a great job.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|You might have a bunch of questions in the beginning and it may feel slow at first, but eventually it starts to pick up some.<br /><br />On the way, you'll slowly start to put pieces together before they happen so that was sort of nice to figure out as it came along.<br /><br />It's definitely bittersweet and unique in its own sense -- with the way the characters used their own methods to deal with stuff. I like how she created new words to use and how she made different words to symbolize what matters in the characters' lives. Specifically, \\"live,\\" and \\"hopeless.\\"<br /><br />You'll not like the bad stuff that may have happened to a few of the characters, but it is life, and it can happen. It's the way people cope with stuff that matters, I guess? And how everything comes together in the end, despite all the difficult experiences.
B000IZA9NK|5.0|Very well done escapist fare that captures the feel and look of the slam-bang '30s-'40s Hollywood adventure serials and features that capitalized on the wonders of the budding Jet & Space Ages with dashing heroes and heroines fighting Evil wherever it was found...I loved it !
B008IGP8QE|5.0|My granddaughter is a Ross Lynch fan...bought the soundtrack for Christmas.  Was expecting it to arrive in January, but it was on my doorstep Christmas eve.  She was delighted!
B0009ZHJ7S|5.0|This is a great movie that my kid and really like. I especially love the backgrounds and the characters are great. Of course Mel Brookes and Robin Williams add plenty of fun to an already great animated film.
B001NLKT60|5.0|This book kept me involed throughout. It is full of twists as the first book was. It kept me in suspence. I feel that this is a really good book for mystery lovers.
B00AEJM6H2|4.0|Very ADDICTING! It keeps you wanting to play over and over. Color and sounds are just like an arcade game.
B000VYX8PE|4.0|OMG just finished! It's so good I asked my mom if I could read this late. I recommend this to people who love sarcastic and dark stories.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Very well written. I couldn't put it down. I ordered the other two books for my kindle before I was even finished with it.
1439196834|5.0|This book is hilarious. If you are a How I Met Your Mother Fan you will appreciate this. This is a really good joke gift.
B007TXN4TK|3.0|It is cute how it works....I would like smaller size piano keys which would give more keys to play with...Also, more up to date songs.....
B007XKEY6Q|1.0|I really don't hate it.  I' 've never been able to play this game because it will not accept my password.
0061474355|5.0|Details provided were fascinating & eye-opening. Attention to each character that had significance later on, was well done. I couldn't put this one down, spent late nights finishing chapters. I'm reading Lirael now!
B006SMLAMQ|2.0|Pretty, but it doesn't DO anything. It's not a real time app.  Before you purchase this one, be sure to investigate more options.
B0031YJFCQ|4.0|Read all three books very interesting and entertaining..Good characters good drama story and love story and action story!!wish there was more
B004UC4HCG|4.0|After falling in love with this form factor and function, 11 days in the integrated NIC died.  I as so \\"happy\\" this happened within Amazon's replacement window.  I'm trying unit #2 in hopes for a better experience.<br /><br />After 2 days of trying to understand the perceived defect, I've come to discover that the condition was caused by a ZyXEL powerline module to which this unit connects, certainly no fault of Shuttle.  Had I not have come from an engineering background I never would have properly identified the culprit.<br /><br />Once I removed the ZyXEL from the environment and repowered, things were back to an expected state.<br /><br />I love this little thing... The only loss of a star is from the fan. I've recently ordered a replacement with lower db ratings and hopefully I'll be satisfied.<br /><br />---UPDATE #2---<br />For those of you considering this case, I thought a bit of additional information may prove useful.  For me this is a dedicated HTPC workhorse.  Not only does it control all media in my home, but it has the significant task of currently converting my collection from various file formats to MP4.  The collection has grown over the years and as will happen I've been negligent in organization and cleaning of the library.  My 2008yr HTPC was a larger unit that was prebuilt, and although I had little issues with it, it was struggling with the ability to convert files...so I took the plunge and bought the shuttle to house my new system.<br /><br />I opted for an Intel i7 3770.  If you are heading down the road to HTPC, it is worth researching the different variants of the i7 3770.  For my purposes, including head and power this was the best choice...and I was frankly quite concerned about heat and the Shuttle's ability to handle it (which is the cause for this 2nd update).  Color me impressed.  Idle temp's (idle ... I laugh at idle...this unit has been working nonstop for days with just brief pauses) are in the 30's to 40's...full load (which is what the unit has been running at virtually nonstop) temps are at or about 70C.  The Tj Max for the i7 3770 is 105C.  What is also interesting about the i7 3770 is its internal ability to throttle back to control temp itself (reference: researching variants).  To aid a little in the airflow I do have the unit positioned in such a way where cables in the rear, the wall, etc. are less of an obstruction which does cause me to hear a bit more of the mechanicals than I like, but it isn't so terrible as to be unacceptable.  The i7 3770 has Intel Turbo Boost technology.  When the processor detects headroom in both power and heat it will increase the clock speed.  I didn't think there would be much of this in this specific Shuttle enclosure. Much to my delight the 3.4Ghz processor happily chugs along at a 3.7Ghz.  Not quite the max Turbo of 3.9Ghz, but considering I expected no available headroom once more I am impressed.<br /><br />I may opt for trying an aftermarket silent fan if the spirit hits me, but for now I can't tout this particular Shuttle enough.

0765325950|1.0|Robert Jordan has been a favorite author of mine for nearly 20 years.  I am sad to have to deliver a 1-star rating for this book because of the ridiculous split-release of digital format 3 months after the hardcover.  I will not reward this behavior and borrow, check out or otherwise find a loaner copy of this book.  I will not purchase the ebook.  Until publishers get with the times and realize that the market has changed we must speak with our wallets and reviews.  To those who feel this is unfair to the author - look to none other than Harriet for where the blame lies.  All because she wanted to ensure that the book hits #1 on the NY Times Hardcover list.  This poorly thought-out decision will ultimately cost her, Brandon Sanderson, and TOR, money and customers, as is clear by the abundance of 1-star reviews with a similar viewpoint.
B009VLX8FS|3.0|Not her best ,but easy to listen to. Makes me want to say &#34;Its ok&#34;. Glad I got for under $5.00.
B009G7ZYPY|5.0|Best Susan Boyle yet!  The duets with Donny Osmond and Michael Crawford are superb.  It's delightful to hear Ms. Boyle continue to grow musically and be more assured as a performer.  You go girl.
B000VBIGD6|3.0|I was surprised at the content. I had seen this movie many times but there was content in this version that I had not seen. I was not impressed with the partial nudity and the language. So disappointed....
B002PEP4U0|5.0|It took me a while to figure out where this book was headed and to get into the story.  But, in exchange for my patience, I was rewarded with a truly unique story.  William's accomplishments are truly amazing and inspirational.  So, that's the reward in the last third or so of the book.  The first two thirds is an interesting exploration of William's family life and the culture and society in which he grew up from the perspective of someone who is both in it and outside of it at the same time (I suspect the latter perspective is augmented by his co-author).  While I was slow to see what was unfolding in the first two thirds, I am now equally glad for that part of the book.  I am very glad to have read the book and it leaves me searching for ways to make more meaningful contributions individuals and societies that are working to overcome the devastations of famines and to provide universal education.
B000VZBCWE|5.0|The Live Aid concert is superb. You can tell Freddie was struggling with his voice, but it's still superior in every way. The Montreal concert is so-so, but interesting. I do recommend it if you are a Queen and/or Freddie collector. The Live Aid portion makes it worth the purchase. No hesitation.
B0082EFM2C|5.0|Silky voice with just enough rasp. There has to be a hit in here somewhere, I'm looking forward to hearing more of music from this artist.
B000000OA6|5.0|The music on this recording is great, but different from most Queen records. Heavier. The lyrics drive home where Freddie was in his last days. It's great, don't misunderstand. But it really was the end of Queen, of Freddie, and it has a sad feel to it in places. Highly recommend it for Queen collectors and/or Freddie fans.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|A trash novel striving for shock effect and succeeding for the purpose of selling books. Cannot be viewed as legitimate literature. Purely pulp.
125000568X|5.0|This  book is a must for any Queen fan. Lots of interesting extras inside. Posters, tickets, etc. Very, very cool! The content of the book is great! Absolutely a requirement for anyone who loved Queen and/or Freddie.
B0052RDHTM|4.0|Fall of Giants is an intriguing weave of history and how it very plausibly impacted intersecting lives. Well written and interesting.
B009DH372Y|5.0|I didn't know what to expect when I purchased this, but honestly: it is the best concert I've seen of Queen. Freddie's voice was clear, vocals really crisp. You can tell the guys wanted this to be a well-received concert. I own all of the Queen music CD's and this is the one I watch and/or listen to over and over. Really is wonderful. Freddie was spot-on. Really is great. Highly recommend for any Freddie and/or Queen fan.
B009MB682W|4.0|On the whole, the Bond theme songs are very good, with some real stand-outs and just a few 'odd jobs' (the Madonna and A-ha entries are tragic).
145210655X|5.0|A fun book, not much to say, but more than enough to buy it and have a nice laugh. It's a great book, a warm book.<br /><br />If you love Star Wars you'll love it, and it's the perfect gift for the classic Star Wars fan, I should now.<br /><br />Five stars and kudos to the author, Jeffrey Brown.
0756697875|4.0|My son loves two things: Super Heroes and Legos, so this book was a great find &#34;from Santa.&#34;  There seems to be a lot of detail here for the hard core Lego fan and kids alike - my son loves to have me read him this at night instead of your more traditional story book.  There are also some comic book style stories throughout which he loves.  He is also a fan of the Lego video games and the included mini-fig ties into the game.
0545265355|5.0|the price of this was great for someone who just had to have this book before seeing the movie. its what kids want.
B0086700CM|5.0|I love this game its fun and addicting. I would recommend this game if your looking for a fun entertaining game.
B005H0IW6W|5.0|Michael Bublé is such a fantastic singer and performer.  His charisma shines through anything he sings...in this case he takes well known Christmas music and sings it with such sweetness and uniqueness (for example: All I want for Christmas) that you never want to stop listening...
B0076DCT2G|5.0|DeMille is the best. There are non better. Corey's character is a wise cracking detective and is as close to real life as it gets. In the real world a police detective who is good at what he does acts the same way. Believe me I know. I like the way DeMille brought realism into this book and its characters.  Great Job.
B008FPOIT6|4.0|Smart, funny and very entertaining!  I have recommended this book to several friends, who have all agreed, this book was difficult to put down.  Great book for a snowy day or if you need a few good belly laughs!
B009E3EY38|4.0|These guys still sound great although nothing really new but all classic Zeppelin songs. Blu-ray sound is awesome 5.1 DTS.<br />Must have for collection. Great buy!
B009KS4XRO|2.0|I love bongo but sometimes I collect and it disappears other times I purchase cards and get charged but don't receive the cards. So disappointed!
B008XG1X18|5.0|LOVE PINTEREST! WE USE IT ALL THE TIME, HOW GREAT IS THIS WEBSITE? GRRRRRRRRRRRREAT!  HAVE MADE LOTS OF GREAT THINGS. THX
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|Very addictive! Downloaded for my 8 yr old son, but once I got started I could not put it down!
B008JFUUIA|5.0|Love this movie. The one liners keep coming. I didn't know half the actors in this movie, but after watching it, I am surprised they haven't been in other movies. Great pairing of actors for this movie. And the music is awesome.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|reminds me of the games that used to be at fairs and festivals.  challenging and makes you think where to put the coins to get your prize
B00992CF6W|3.0|Good game but I want a free version of this game&hellip;cause I played it on ipod I don't know about kindle fire!!!!
B007SYWFRM|2.0|had to delete or download another program to play it with, so I deleted it, needs to be like other games you just download and play
B004LWZWGK|5.0|A very good action movie with a great storyline. Loved the ending and hope for some more batman movies very soon!
B0000DC13U|4.0|Well, it was a an...interesting...film...not a straight-ahead documentary, but did have some added surrealistic clips put in. Not for the casual Stones fan.
B000WCBMA8|5.0|This was my first cd from The Hives and I loved it!  I plan on completing my collection.<br />These guys bring a entertaining combination of  the garage band sound with moments of unexpected and unusual sounds.  There is also a slight rough edgey-ness to thier sound that feels very &#34;raw and real&#34; which I find missing in a lot of modern music.  It's a great jam!
B00867GKIK|5.0|This came to me just like advertised, and my husband loved this gift for Christmas! The movie has special meaning to him, and having such a variety of ways to view this movie really made him happy.
B000ATQYT2|5.0|This movie is so entertaining! I was thrilled to find it here online and was very happy with the quality of the DVD.
B0054PSY2W|4.0|It was puchased as a Christmas present for my Father who throughly enjoyed it!  Are there any simular related films available? Thanxs
B009NCM248|5.0|This is SS at their finest. These guys are aging like a fine wine and the albums are just getting better and better.
B00005N6KG|2.0|Just got these headphones figuring they would feel and sound like the sony walkman headsets of old but they do not. Cheap feeling plastic, thin sound, no bass and strange wire exit from the speakers make the headset a sub par replica. They are not worth a penny more than 5 bucks. Its not worth going through the hasstle of returning, so I'll just keep them as a backup. Guess I have to deal with the modern earbud style to get decent sound quality. Oh well.
B008XNZMOU|5.0|I am so thankful that I didn't have to go to the store to buy this during the Christmas season.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|I cannot wait to go see this movie. Especially since it was just nominated for an Oscar today. I hardly ever get through a book, but I read this book in about a week.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Pure Awesomeness! I had never seen the show before until I was bored flipping through Netflix. After the first episode I was hooked. I watched Season 1 and Season 2 on Netflix then bought 1/2 of Season 3 on Amazon. Now I have the agony of waiting till Feb 10 for the rest of Season 3, but atleast I'm caught up. Come on Feb 10!
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I can't get enough of this series.  Besides watching the DVDs to catch up to season three, I have read everything that I can find on the Internet reguarding the making of the series.
B00APUYWYA|5.0|A light-hearted movie that takes you away from your problems for a couple of hours.  The music is enjoyable.  If you like Glee, you will like this movie.
0765325950|5.0|I almost wish I could write two reviews, one about content and one responding to all the e-book reviews. I'll try to do both here.<br /><br />First and Most important is actuall CONTENT. What all reviews on Amazon should be about.<br /><br />The writing style is not Jordan's style it's Sanderson's style. He tries. You can especially tell in the battle scenes. It's close but not perfect. Jordan at his best was poetry. It flowed. Sanderson tries and does it well but it is noticeable especially if you've recently read the originals. On the bright side Sanderson's story pacing is better. Let's face it. Jordan by the end was dragging his stories. Discussions about dresses and plate patterns abounded in his later works. It was horrible. Sanderson moves the story at times frantically and it pulls you right in. Sanderson also doesn't quite capture the character's voices right. He can't. They were Jordan's voices. He does as well as can be and hits it at times (maybe specific segments written by Jordan himself, who knows). It is still excellently written and shocking how well he does. I read the Mistborn novels and didn't see an ability to write WoT. Then I read &#34;Way of Kings&#34; and saw it.<br /><br />What we waited for. Story. Is it the greatest ending to a story ever no but it was satisfying. I have closure. Even if it had been the greatest ending I would still have quibbles, it's human nature. I don't like where he ended it time wise. I generally like the last chapter to take place months later to years later. This story ended right after. Since there's no chance for later novels I want some extra closure. But it was okay. Major characters were killed. The ones killed left a slightly off taste in my mouth also, with one exception, how. Anticlimactic for characters who I spent hours reading about and POVs I spent following. Final confrontation with Padan Fain was also kind of crappy. Once again a lot of build up for a lukewarm final confrontation. Final battle with dark one was okay too.<br /><br />The book itself was basically a nine hundred page battle. Still not 100% how I feel about that. I guess good since I gave it 5 stars but it was at times like wow this has been going on forever.<br /><br />I had no bittersweet feelings like I usually have when I finish a series. Too many years, too many delays, too many bad books for me to feel anything but relief that it ended and ended well enough. Twenty years I've been reading the Wheel of Time. I started in 92 or 93, I think 93 by what books were out when I started.<br /><br />Tai'Shar Manetheren. Tai'shar Malikier. And despite some hard feelings at times, to Robert Jordan (James Rigney) the dream is over. Wake.<br /><br />Too all the one star e-book whiners. Shut up. I'm glad it was delayed. I have nothing against e-books. I have the kindle app on my phone and have plans to purchase a Kindle white. That being said there is still something about holding a physical book in your hands. I'm a Bibliophile plain and simple and initial launches are for us.<br /><br />Griping about a lack of e-book is like griping about no paperback option. First launches are for the real fans. Fans who want the hardback and don't mind paying for it. Giving one star is idiotic.<br /><br />If you read and hated the book fine. Point deductions for poor binding or typeset or spelling errors are even allowed. Point deductions for shipping issues fine. Giving one star to a version of the book you haven't read and don't want to buy.... Once again Shut Up.<br /><br />Amazon, please remove all reviews that are based on lack of e-book availability. All real reviewers who follow I ask to repeat this request to Amazon.
B00AHSIQWE|5.0|A terrific ending to a phenomenal series.  I loved the first two movies in the series, but I would say that this is the BEST out of the three.  Totally enjoyed it.
B0067R0APK|5.0|No complaints. The app works as well as it should and I like how simple it is to use. Worth checking out the settings as they are very usefu.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Great book....not what I expected and was pleasantly surprised by the story line, the suspense and trickery.  Kept me intrigued hard to put down.  First book purchased on my new kindle fire hd...moving on to the. Next two.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Just have to keep trying to get each level.  A fun game to occupy relaxed time.  Trajectory is everything to win.
B00APUQH0W|1.0|The movie was great, but the experience was bad due to the streaming video.  It took well over three hours to watch a two hour movie.
B00AHXIC50|4.0|What can I say it's Bruno..... timeless,  classic tunes of music I'm gonna listen to forever.  Up tempo yet a feel of old Motown.
B000J2BRQU|5.0|good movie to watch if you want hot cars and girls at the same time. Definitely would recommend this movie.
1597801585|1.0|Slow, dull, and boring.  Not enough introduction to explain how the world got to be the way it is, and then not enough excitement to make this worth reading.  No new ideas or concepts for a post nuclear world city.  Wind-up springs to generate electricity?  Weak.  All of current concepts are more believable than wind-up springs.  Wind energy, Solar, Geo-Thermal, Battery Backup, Generators, Gyroscopes, Magnetic Turbines, etc - all of these are proven techonologies already, so why this book took you down the road of recycling poop to create gas to power lights, or wind-up springs is beyond me.  I have an interest in alternative energies, but this book didn't even touch on it.  It was basically a love-fest about a prostitute girl &#34;robot&#34; that overheats on every other page - dumb.
B009R8DJ72|3.0|a very good story<br />hats off to Jeff Kenney on his latest book..................but<br />it lacks a bit of suspence that made the rest of his books so great<br />but overall a great book
0345529057|5.0|I think I'm through book 5 or 6, whatever!  I'm just disappointed in the delay between books.  Silly and ridiculous that these have been 10-years in the making but only half-way complete?  Is this right?  Come on guys... finish it already.  I'm going to have to go back and re-read to catch-up on what is happening.  I'm forgetting already.  Same thing with the DVD series, only season 1 is complete but HBO is already filming season 4 or 5?  Why aren't both season 2 and 3 in stores yet?  I'm frustrated and ready to give up on A Game of Thrones - anyone still reading this should wait and return in 3-4 years before buying!
B001TXWJ4M|5.0|I would recommend this season to anyone who watched season 1.  You won't be disappointed so get it!  I am on to season three now!!!
B000R7GKQE|5.0|I had a great experiance ordeeing this DVD series. My order arrived in a rimely fashion and my husband loved it!
B003JTHXOK|2.0|This book was an enjoyable read. However, if you are familiar with Sparks books it might seem like you've read it before. Down and out single character meets love of their life, and poof...drama! The book is lacking literal passion. There is a connection between the characters that seems unrealistic. I wish Sparks would use less Bible references and more steamy words to heat up the pages of this book. I'd be surprised it the movie wasn't a tad more steamy.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|love this game most addicting game and even better than temple run can't take my eyes off it so addicting keep up the good work
B00447G29S|5.0|Just purchased a 3d television.  Wanted a movie we would all watch, this was perfect.  Already know the story, so 3D made it better.
B00A3DZ61W|5.0|Angry Birds was getting old, until this game came along. I love that there is a little forgiveness in the game. In some Angry Birds games you have to hit everything just right. With this game, you can at least get one star without too much difficulty.
B000R7I3LY|3.0|I love this album, I simply gave it three stars because the case was broken and that's not cool.CD was in good shape though.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I like the game I think everybody will like it. I like when you beat the game and get bonus money.
B003ZDZ1WG|3.0|I wanted to give this for a gift, but the case was broken...so I gave it a three star rating because really, who wants a broken CD case?
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|very addictive game keeps you intertaned andyuor mind acctive makes you think in order to get 3stars . would tell everyone to try if you like this kind of game!!
B00633W614|5.0|Loved this book; only wish the next one in the series w<br />as ready.  It won't be out until May.
B0083ZBW2Y|3.0|Haven't read it yet, but have seen the movie before. I will get around to reading it soon. When I have time.
B007FJFDXS|5.0|It's tough to find a puzzle game that is truely challenging, but this one has a few twists and turns to keep it interesting.
B005HSL626|4.0|I don't play games like this, but she put in on my Kindle to play and I assume she's enjoying it.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I love being able to get to all my kindle books when ever and where ever I am. The page saving feature is a great help when I go from the phone to the laptop.
B00AP9RQE4|4.0|this was fun and it wrapped up the question of what happened to Ivan.<br />bujold can move on to the next generation now!<br />also touches on the dangers of bio-engineering leading to new forms of slavery although the baronne avoided that in the story.
B004SRNH10|3.0|I was hoping to find a Java program for my cell for a few work applications that I wanted to add to my cell. This wasn't what I was looking for but has been helpful for a few other things.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|My daughter read and enjoyed all of these Wimpy Kid books.<br /> [[ASIN:B00604VN7Y The Circus In The Mist]] is still top on her list because of the artwork and because no one else has a copy.
B004EFYZ1C|4.0|It's cool app that changes hourly to reflect the moor phase in your location. Only had a couple glitches, but usually works with out any problems.
B005LHOKFS|5.0|I am a huge fan of this app. It's perfect for travelers who travel to major cities. However, if you are going to a small town or a less known city, it's hard to find a lot of reviews for hotels and restaurants. I often use this app when trying to find a good hotel, especially with no bed bugs. It's great at finding stuff to do in cities. Overall this app is super helpful for a traveler going to well known areas.
B0017O1MIM|5.0|Another great movie.  This was a Christmas gift for my husband and he loved it.  It came on time and in good condition.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I have tried so many different Bible Apps and this one by far is the best. I love the plans, there is so much variety and they are all for free. There are so many translations you will definitely find the translation you like the best. The set up takes some getting used to but besides that the app is excellent!
B004EFYZ1C|1.0|This the most useless app I have seen yet. You can look out your window and get the same info as this gives you.
B0027MJU00|4.0|Like gone girl this book goes every other chapter from perspectives of different characters. The plot is a little darker and I found myself investing in a character that would generally be unlikeable. Gillian Flynn is an extremely talented writer who keeps you guessing to the very end. Check out Dark Objects as well!!!
B009VSW15Y|4.0|I only wish the Kindle had a forward facing camera so you could aim and shoot other things beside yourself.
B009YP9L7U|3.0|Not a challenging read or unique story line but an entertaining read nonetheless. Had to finish so I could move on to more unpredictable books on my list
B008JGSM6G|4.0|The grandkids like it, I like it, the wife likes it and the dog likes it. What more could you ask for.
B009VB97EY|3.0|The scenes chosen for the preview were good - those were the best parts of the whole movie.<br />There wasn't much of a plot - was expecting more - considering the actors who took part.
B007Q0OUNA|5.0|From the horses to the characters to the complex multi-faceted tower this set won out on Christmas day. Before dinner was served my son had it completed and he had Bilbo defending off the ring wraiths.  Not as inexpensive as some off-brand building blocks it is a bit pricey but no one builds them like LEGO. The pieces fit together very well and the tower is quite sturdy when completed. Although my son will not be watching the movie for many years he loves the set and because of the LEGO website he probably knows more about the storyline then I do and I've read the book.<br /><br /> Highly recommended.<br />.
B001BANK32|5.0|Ive always been a fan of the movie. But after finally reading this book i feel like that movie did this story the greatest injustice. Amazing book. A must read for King fans
B004U52VPS|4.0|Great for the little kids. Simple and fun but best of all it's not overly priced like most games today. The materials are good and the construction is solid. The slingshot is simple and no one will get hurt.<br /><br />Highly recommended.
0062209493|5.0|I bought this audio book for my brother, but he said it's the best book he has ever read/listened to.
B00AC8ZA3M|4.0|If you like BattleStar Galactica and Stargate SG-1, this will feel familiar.  It starts off a little slow, but then great stories sometimes do. At least they begin at the beginning, before the main cast even is aware of the Covenant and humans are still at war with other humans.  The effects are as good as can be, but the Covenant are hard to see in detail, probably due to the night fight scene.  I got a rush just from seeing an operational, live-action Warthog.
0545305497|5.0|Well written, lots of cliff hangers and sadness but a view at what can happen when government has too much control. A great read and a message as well.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Finally somebody made a good and fairly realistic TV series with zombies.  This show could last as long as the writers keep going.  Its even easy for the writers to add and remove main characters when necessary.  Just kill some off and find new survivors that get along (or have them born).  Talk about big success on what must be a low budget!  You just can't pack this kind of detail about a post-apocalyptic, zombie infested world into a movie.  Everyday necessities can finally be addressed... food, water, shelter, medicine, ammo, and dealing with other humans who may or may not be on your side.  Resident Evil, eat your heart out!!!
B0012QCZ54|5.0|This was a christmas gift for my daughter.  Order was received on time and in great condition.  She was very happy with the gift.
B00138KFYO|5.0|Love the music. Download was quick, sounds great! Love the option of the cloud player. Decent price. What more could you ask for. Highly recommend.
B009JZTOG8|5.0|The story is so well written and clever. It can be corny at times but I think I like it that way. I love it!
B004DLPXAO|5.0|This is a great application if you don't have a kindle. I use it on my android tablet and my Galaxy III phone. I love it! This makes reading so convenient and easy. I haven't read this much material in quite a few years. I consider this a MUST HAVE.
B004QX07G4|5.0|Loved this volume just because it's so sincere to Ellen's personality - no censorship needed nor applied, just simple honesty mixed with hysterics. I had to stop reading in public because I couldn't stop laughing to myself. If you love her, you'll love it. Simple.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|The writing was pretty bad.  It was hot and steamy, but the story was not the best either. Wish I could have got into it.
B00AHSIQWE|1.0|What were they thinking?  Too long, too dark, too boring.  Way better things to do with your time. Forget it.
B000W7JWUA|4.0|I liked this game.  Like many board games, it takes a while to play and we often don't have the time to get it out.  Additionally, it is a little difficult to teach, so when friends come over, their learning curve also takes time.  If time is not a factor, get it!  Fun for adults once you get going.
0786838655|5.0|While this book might not be the strongest in the series, it is the best by far. The reason I am billing this book as the best is because it is the book that created a foundation for writer Rick Riordan to continue the Percy Jackson series. It gets off to quite a slow start, and is quite difficult to get through, but without this first book, you wouldn't be able to enjoy the other ones. I applaud Rick for getting this written and published without giving up, because it is easy to get intimidated and abandon even the greatest writing project. Just that alone makes him an awesome writer.<br />This story has been made into a movie, a movie that lives up to the book, but still doesn't quite surpass the book. The reason it is not quite as good is because the book has a lot more in it that they were unable to include in the movie. Just like every other situation, I suggest you read the book before you watch the movie, and the book is better than the movie, although they are both strong.
B001UGB1X8|2.0|this movie is fantastic if you suffer from chronic insomnia and are desperate for a non-addictive sleep aid. i've attempted to watch it twice. it's so bad i forgot i saw it and that's the only reason there was a 2nd attempt. didn't bother to finish it either time as far as i can remember. zzzzzzz
1423101499|4.0|The Battle of the Labyrinth. What can I say about that? It has more of a Greek Mythology background than the other ones did. It focused more on a place mentioned in Greek Mythology than what fictitious Greek Gods were saying and doing. I think that makes it better than the previous ones.<br />It held my interest longer than The Titan's Curse, which is a sign that the series is quickly getting stronger, and greater in intensity. This book also was longer and had more content than the Sea of Monsters, which makes it perfect. The only one it doesn't pass is the Lightning Thief, because that book is a classic, the beginning of a legend.<br />This book is also more intense compared to the other ones. If you've read my previous reviews, you might find this repetitive: these last three stories are growing in intensity. Percy is getting older, more mature, and I think Rick did a wonderful job if including Percy's rising maturity in the series. The relationships Percy has now and the way Percy talks is changing rapidly with each new chapter. It is growing in intensity, and everything is bubbling up for the final book where everything is going to explode.<br />All in all, guys, this is a pretty good book.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|We could not wait for season three.  Another show you should try is Larkrise to Candleford and Cranford.  You can't go wrong, great dialogue, characters and wholesome.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This was a great read, maybe a touch below the the first book, but very close. Good character development, god storyline.
B008F2AKUA|5.0|Let's face it- I'm a longtime lover of this amazing group, so any review will be skewed (at least I'm honest).  But I love this compilaton because it puts so many (21 to be exact) of my favorites together in one place.  Many of these are 2006 digital remasters, and there are some variations from the original album recordings (which no one but a geek like me who listened to the orginals so often that they long ago became part of my mental background music would notice)- still, the true musicianship and harmonies that make them the News ring out.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|Good book, though I rank it the weakest of the series of three. I was a bit disappointed in the character development in this book, the storyline was good but not quite great. I did enjoy parts of the ending. Still worth reading as part of the trilogy.
B00AJRQLTI|4.0|Let me preface: I have never seen the musical on stage. I have heard the Broadway soundtrack maybe a couple times, several years ago, so I'm to this with a fairly clean palate.<br /><br />That said, most of the cast does a great job in this. The only parts I have not been thrilled by are some of the Javert (Russell Crowe) parts. Either he's just not as good a singer as the rest of the cast, or he isn't putting his heart into it (probably the former).
B006LSZECO|5.0|One of the best I've read in years!  I would have finished it in two days had I had the time.
B0041KKYGU|2.0|When \\"Animal House\\" (1978) and \\"Porky's\\" (1982) burst onto the cinematic scene, they ushered in the new genre of the R-rated comedy, a style of film so narrow that attempting to release an entertaining movie can be as challenging as a perfect score on the SAT's.  Unfortunately, \\"Bad Teacher\\" barely achieves a passing grade.<br /><br />The film is cast well: Cameron Diaz plays Elizabeth Halsey, a golddigger who decides that teaching is an easy way to bide her time (summers off, supposedly short work days) while searching for a rich man to support her extravagant habits for the rest of her life.  She meets Justin Timberlake, who plays a rich school substitute that Diaz believes to fit her bill, but only after she can purchase breast implants. With her sights set on her male conquest, she moves in for the kill, in competition with a nauseatingly over-enthusiastic colleague, played to the hilt by \\"Dinner for Schmucks'\\" Lucy Punch, who provides ample perseverance for Timberlake's affection.<br /><br />Though the actors understand their comedy, the plot is mundane.  That Diaz distorts going through the motions of responsibility within the school community (chaperoning a car wash dressed in Daisy Dukes, scheming to cheat on a standardized test to acquire the school bonus for the top score) to acquire the funds for her surgery comes across as ridiculous and makes one want to expel her for the remainder of the school year. By the time she realizes the predictable error of her ways, we don't care.  Only Jason Segel, as the gym teacher who sees through the transparent façade of Diaz's schemes, appears as a likeable character within this dimwitted academic institution.  Give \\"Bad Teacher\\" a C-;  it doesn't fail, but you won't consult it for any help with your homework.
B005D9B26E|5.0|I gave this box set to a friend for Christmas. She loved it. She was so excited being that we saw The Who perform a few weeks before and it's her favorite band.<br />I'm very pleased with my order!!!
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|I love the author's style of writing. The characters come for to life.  I have recommended his trilogy to several friends and family, and would recommend it to anyone who enjoys a good writer.
B0086700CM|4.0|I don't give 5 stars unless I'm pretty obsessed over it.  good time filler for ten minute breaks at work.
B00AQMSJI2|2.0|this game is disappointing.  especially with the space needed.  its a simple rpg.  it has good points: its cute you get to do a lot.  the bad far out weighs it though, it is large, has to load frequently, and has unclear goals.  with the bugs in other games id prefer to deal with the bugs.  I uninstalled it.  not worth it.
B009EEFTMC|5.0|Love this game.  Whether I am trying to beat my best time or just passing the time, it is GREAT
B001P06GX4|5.0|Blokus is a clever game with some educational aspects<br />We all enjoy playing it as a family.<br />You are asking for too long a review...
B009KS4XRO|5.0|I am already playing this on my PC.  Fantastic that I can take it with me now wherever I go.
B004GHNIRK|5.0|Oh the misery. Oh the stories. Oh the history. Oh the details. Oh the vocabulary. Oh the depths we’re taken by Les Miserables. Recommended for Junior High and High School students and again for any adult of any age and more so if you're seen the movie or the Broadway show because only a book can take you places into the heart, the soul of a nation, or into your own beating heart through the author's words.Take this book on for a project, for the purpose of getting to the end to understand the human race, yourself, and why we should love the French again.
B004UJAOLM|4.0|Wuthering Heights - is one of the excellent classic novels that should be read by everyone, that likes Emily Bronte novels.
B0097EWK3A|5.0|Very fun seek and find game with a mystery to solve. You have to find clues and do puzzles to move forward.
B001AQMBJQ|4.0|I gave a 4 rating because the format was a bit cumbersome to navigate on these discs.  The versions of Seasons 1-4 that I have are easier to move through and to start and then resume play without having to go through the whole system of selecting the episode and fast-forwarding to pick up the story where I last left off.<br /><br />The quality of the episodes,features, etc. was good--color was bright, no skips or scratches. I'm happy to have Season 5!
B009JBZH54|5.0|Its a Great complete package and for an outstanding price, its three movies for the price of one, with good resolution.
B00866H7SS|4.0|I read this book following a fifty shades hangover.... It was better written than 50 Shades of Grey but the characters were less lovable. I found myself drawing comparisons the whole time but i still can't wait for book number three!
B002M9WW30|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies of all time and for a great price you cant ask for more, really happy with this buy.
B0050AV5MW|5.0|So thrilled to finally have the books. I finished watching the series and it doesnt take anything away from the book experience, instead it helps it.<br /><br />Go! Get! It!
B0089Q1TPM|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies of all time and for that price its more than enough, fully recommended.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|A truly honest book. Provoking, real, and altogether perfect. A must for those with awkward teen years...so basically everyone. Awesome.
B000UJ48UO|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies of all time and for that price its more than enough, fully recommended.
B008N9AAQ4|5.0|Samsara was a mesmerizing visual journey that was as spiritual as it was appealing to the eye.  At first I didn't know what to expect and when some foreign dancers with comical expressions appeared on my screen, I was a little apprehensive of what was to come.  The transition between humans and nature is seamless as it then changes to an erupting volcano whose beauty is as overwhelming as it is devastating.  The haunting music began and I was completely drawn in to another world.<br /><br />While I am not all that technical and do not typically see a huge difference between DVD and Blu-Ray, this film was definitely enhanced by Blu-Ray technology.  The imagery is amazing and breathtaking and I could not take my eyes off the screen.  I traveled the world to 25 different countries through the lens.<br /><br />Scenes alternated between nature and humans and showed the extreme sides of both.  From death to life and the dark of night to the beauty of sunrise, Samsara runs the gammit on every life experience.  It plays on your emotions and makes you feel happy and sad, exuberant and then broken.<br /><br />Seeing the devastation left behind from a flood, I felt the devastation in my soul.  Looking at the preserved body of a child in a casket, I felt brokenhearted. Samsara captured my attention and I almost felt as if I were in a trance watching it.  It celebrates the beauty of nature and the beauty of life in a way that words can not capture.  The visual effects are breathtaking and it made me want to travel the world to every one of those countries.<br /><br />At the end I felt refreshed and yet drained at the same time.  I do not watch many documentaries so this was a first for me and a rare experience I never expected from a film.  It made me feel at one with nature and with the human race.  If you want to travel the world, experience culture, beauty, art and history; you need look no further than your own TV with Samsara!
B00AA0TJO8|4.0|pleasing puzzles, perhaps a bit simple  have fun with the crayons, make bunny shaped axes, sledge hammer shaped keys thunder clouds in every last shape. have fun draw things other than what they tell you to. creativity in appearance rather than creativity in puzzle solving
B005WUHAX8|4.0|i would recomend this product becaus it is nice the only thing i dont like about it is that thhe cover for the plug in to charge the phone wont let me put it on my ihome which is why i got the ihome but i like how it is waterproof but the only thing is is does that work we havent had to test that out yet i hope we never do but ya this is a good  product
B001V7YJMG|5.0|Using this amazon feature on PS3 was really convenient, also this movie is really good...<br />That is all that I have to say<br />( :
0765325950|4.0|I read the original book of the Wheel of time the year it first came out. I had no way of knowing that the saga wouldn't be finished until 13 books later.  The very last amazon review I read was the one Robert Jordan finished right before he died.<br />I lost it when I heard so many negative reviews because I knew that he literally poured his life blood into that book and it didn't seem fair that we who got to go on living, most of us not writers could criticize his gift to us.<br /><br />Brandon Sanders does not write with the same voice as Robert Jordan but he certainly shared the same spirit and the same love of the characters that I did.  There were more twist and turns in this book then I've come to expect since the series started.  I confess I cried out loud during the last 125 pages or so and...I started reading slower because I knew things were coming to an end and I didn't want the story to end.  Alas it did end, but it ended with the heart of the story intact.  I do highly recommend this book to those who have had the patience or the love to stay with the series even through the death of the progenitor of the story.<br />For those of you who wanted the books to end years ago you will find enough pace in this last one to make it worth your while to read.  For those of you who like me , savored every word, there were some payoffs in the details.  An example would be the nation of the Sharons.<br />One big problem I had with the original author was the way his men and women related to each other. Mr Sanders treatment was more ameliorated and so I found the interactions in the end more palatable.<br />I so envy those who are just starting the wheel of time series and I feel sad for myself and others who will now close the book on the story of Rand and Egwene and Matt and Perrin,Nynaeve and Morraine. But I take comfort in knowing that the series sits on my shelf and I know that I will read the whole series over and over again in the future.
B00AQ3K8IU|2.0|I did not enjoy this book at all. I felt that the dialogue was poorly written and hard to believe, the plot was predictable and the chemistry between Sky and Holder was non-existent.<br />  The relationships with the obligatory side kick best friends was contrived, at times ridiculous and poorly developed (particularly with Bricken, the flamboyant stereotypical gay BFF who inexplicably instantly adores Sky) It felt like they were just included as a filler between the endless scenes where Sky and Holder would stare meaningfully at each other trying to figure out their attraction to each other.<br />  I usually do not take the time to write a review but I had just finished reading The Sea of Tranquility, by Katya Millay, which I thoroughly enjoyed, and was totally disappointed by this book.
B00178JDCK|4.0|I read the various reviews of this pedal before purchasing it.  They had some valid points as to its cons:<br /><br />[1] yes, it is plastic<br />[2] The method of access to the battery is a pain<br />[3] It uses batteries pretty quickly ( although I've never known a digital reverb or delay that didn't)<br />[4] It's hard to see what reverb you're selecting on the small knob with no &#34;click&#34; stops.<br /><br />However, other things I have read I find no basis for:<br /><br />[1] it does not appear to load or degrade the signal in bypass mode.<br />[2] I cannot understand the review that said it was &#34;too noisy&#34; to play gigs with, unless the reviewer was using it in front of a distortion box or high gain amp ( why anyone would put a reverb at that point in the signal chain is beyond me).<br />[3] The sounds are very usable, and there's a lot of them.<br /><br />Overall, its a $50 pedal, and an excellent $50 pedal!  It's not an obscure $300 boutique unit, and nor should anyone expect one at this price.  In this case you get quite a lot for what you pay.
B005LAJ16I|5.0|I had to catch up. I watched the second year as shown on TV after missing the first year. It was fun to watch, even backwards!!
0812993292|4.0|When Harold Fry, retired from the brewery, receives a letter from Queenie Hennessy, an accountant at the brewery who left the company after taking responsibility for something he had done, informing him she is dying of cancer, Harold sets off on a walk down to the post office to mail a note of support to her, he doesn't stop but continues to walk. And walk he does, all the way to Berwick where Queenie lies in a hospice.<br /><br />It's a slow and sweet story of a man who's lived a conventional and unassuming life. He has become almost invisible to his wife and son. This is a man who has never done anything remarkable in his life, but who believes that if he continues to walk to Berwick, Queenie will live. He sends postcards along the way, telling her he is still walking and for her to continue to live. He meets a variety of people along his journey, some who help and some who hinder his quest.<br /><br />His solitary walks for most of they affords him a great deal of time for self-reflection and he is assailed by memories he had thought lost. He grieves when he remembers his inability to communicate with his son and wife, the loving embrace of his mother, and tries to grasp the moment when his marriage started to unravel. And he remembers Queenie and their work trips.<br /><br />Walking from Dorset to Berwick was to take him multiple weeks, and in that time, dressed only in a shirt, tie, jacket, thin socks and yachting shoes, Harold succumbs to physical discomfort and some serious injuries. He faced moments of despair and uncertainty along his walks, he faced kindness from strangers and he learned the joy that comes with giving without expecting anything in return.<br /><br />Reading this is like taking a slow and sweet journey.
034580404X|3.0|I was talked into reading this.  Haven't read it yet.  Not real inspired to read it.  Might some day but not in any hurry.  Don't think I'm in any hurry to recommend it to anyone else from what I've heard since.
B00ANISBZK|5.0|Wonderful performance--interesting choice of Busoni cadenza. I would recommend this to anyone wanting a new recording of the Brahms concerto.
B000ATQYT2|5.0|Muppet fans will love this classic Christmas story told as only the Muppets can do it.  If has great original songs and the usual quirkyness of the Muppets.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I am woo addicted to this game after playing it a lot of times I rock at it and can play it all day if I wanted to
B00AHSMDQY|5.0|I really enjoyed this flick. It was full of action, suspense, and I watched it all in my living room on HD for $4.99. I couldn't ask for a cheaper, more enjoyable movie/date night at home on the couch with my man. :)
B0076DELIG|5.0|The Black Box reminded me of Connelly's earlier works with a lot of action and suspense. And, showing a more driven Bosch than ever. After all he's been through...
0131103628|5.0|This book has allowed me to improve my C skills by filling in the gaps for the concepts, and tricks of the trade I was unaware of. Because of this book, I can save time by having these concepts more stable and understood in my coding activities. This book is very technical and very intense, however if you put your head down and push through it, you will come out a better more skilled coder on the other side. Nothing but respect for this book. Highly recommend it.
0765325950|1.0|I have been reading this series since its inception over twenty years ago. A couple years back I switched to ereaders to make my library more accessible and easier on my lifestyle. Obviously, I needed to remain a burdened Luddite, as Tor and Harriet have made the horrific decision to delay the digital version of this crowning work.<br /><br />This is a 1 star review to repay them for the same kindness they have shown me and the millions of others who use eReaders.
B0079XNWQA|4.0|Very good product, although I realized I don't like mushy gooey love stuff.  I sound itself was excellent, but now what I expected.
B005GFPZYK|2.0|I am afraid that this man was on an ego trip before he went into the army and has remained so, this is probably why he is still uncomfortable at home.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|My grandsons love this game, which keeps them busy when visiting me - although fighting ensues over who had it first.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|It is full of everything, excitement, love and the expressiveness of every page of \\"the hunger games\\" and \\"catching fire\\"
B0083P1QUM|2.0|I've followed Kay Scarpetta's career from the beginning, but this one was flat and dull. I really didn't care whether she and Benton solved this one
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|I lovs playing this game and play it all the time.Hope they come up with even more levels.As i've played all m297 games and have started over again.
B0013TTLDE|5.0|Such a graceful, proper period in time. Such sanctimonious hypocrisy! Kate Morton makes me feel like I'm rightin the  big middle of it all
B006LSZECO|3.0|Gone Girl - So far it is ok... I'm still reading it. Not much conversation going on. Like i've said before I'm still reading.  Hope it will get better.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|If you loved 50 Shades of Grey, this is right up there with that!  I may have even liked this series better, I just wish the last one would come out sooner than May :(
B007TXN4TK|3.0|Sorry that I did 5 I meant to do 3 my kindle messed up and I could not get back to three. ANYWAYS. The thing that I do not like about it is that it does not have enough songs in it . I know that it is free but it should still have more. Over all it is okay, but there is better piano faces that have more than this as does. I would say by it if you want to.
B00846REIS|5.0|If you loved 50 Shades of Grey, this is right up there with that!  I may have even liked this series better, I just wish the last one would come out sooner than May :(
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I could not put this book down! I am 17 and I read it in a total time of 5 hours. It's amazing
B001U3Y5XE|1.0|While this may be a popular game, it is not worth the money.  The game does not include alot of pieces and most of the items that you have to make on the cards this game does not have the pieces to make it.  I am extremely  disappointed with this game, I would rather have spent the money on an actual lego set.
B005OKTPKC|3.0|A little too slow at the start and somewhat predictable outcome.  A nice touch of pathos in his treatment of the young victim and his family.
0937381888|5.0|This is a great book! It definitely shows you how to make your own beer. I bought it for my boyfriend and he cannot put it down!
B008FYZIVY|5.0|We caught the DA bug late and decided to get up to speed.  The quality of the product itself was first rate and the content was great.  We are hooked.
B00009NHC5|5.0|It starts out slow but it works its way to this one scene that is so worth it. It has a bit of Alfred Hitchcock feel it. And who does not love Audrey?
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I am not an avid reader but after seeing the movie, \\" The Hunger Games\\", I wanted more. I was hooked and hung on each page, surprised at times, sad at times, but mostly in love with the characters and the dynamics. I highly recommend this book.
0345528581|5.0|It has a lot of info on heaps of different exercises that are fantastic for strength and fitness. More importantly it includes easier and harder variations so you don't feel bad if you can't do one. I have had it for about 2 months and for the first time in my exercise history I have been consistent. I definitely recommend this
1592537251|4.0|Always a beginning artist.  Use a lot of tools, books, and equipment to give me ideas.  This is directed to the larger city field sketching.  Activity can apply to rural area communities as well.
1582701709|5.0|I think this should be required reading for the entire world.  Would be great if it was introduced to us all as children - we'd have so much more of a beautiful start to life - whoever we are, where ever we live.
B00632HWOG|5.0|Very easy and love the new layout and color purple. The features are understandable. Its fast and has great sound when one receives a new email.
B002ROKQJM|4.0|A very interesting and engaging read.<br />For anyone looking for a book to read this one will keep you entertained - that's for sure.
B00622B3MY|3.0|I liked the original cars movie for the kids, an even the Mater's total tales shorts. But unfortunately I found myself having to explain to a 6 and 3 year old why cars were being killed (one in a metal compactor, one whose oil is show splattered on the camera, the rest  set on fire by laser beams) and why they were trying to kill Lightnening McQueen. It was a good movie, but it has themes more apropriate for older kids, so be prepared for that because I wasn't.
B00628RVV0|5.0|the story line was great!  it was heart warming and showed how ignorance and so called power can destroy those who cause no harm
B000BW7QWW|5.0|I almost don't have to put it in the dvd player. I have scene the movie so many times I can practically see the movie just holding it in my hand.
B00A6PD9I4|5.0|I loved this movie because it has comedy, adventure, and teaches parents how to understand their children better, also teaches about friendship.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I watch one show a night. But wont watch the last one that way there will always more, Best show on TV... Ever.
B008XCM18Q|4.0|Basically well written and interesting. Extremely detailed, sometimes too much time is spent on insignificant details. Good intrigue, another Robert Ludlum book such as only he writes. I would recommend it .
B000K15VSA|5.0|My husband had been wanting this. Blade Runnr is one of his favorite movies of all times. He loved it.
B00A9C3RB8|4.0|This is a story about married life that a lot of people go through.Very intertaining and believable.It shows how easy it is to get in a rut and not realize it.
B004GHNIRK|1.0|I know this is a classic but, as with a lot of classics, it's not easy reading - I read for entertainment and this book is not very entertaining.
B001U7B4T8|1.0|This needs to be a 2-CD set - to include My Back Pages as well as many of the other memorable performances. Simply does not do justice to this historic concert. I remember -- I was there!
1609613937|5.0|I have read several books on diet but McDougall has the best plan.  Of all the books, of any topic, I have read this one is the most helpful in terms of avoiding disease and suffering.  I have no connection with Dr. McDougall and no vested interest in his work.
0399160450|5.0|I'm so glad to have Tom Clancy writing again, even if it is &#34;with&#34; someone else. This is the third of the new books I've read, and it was just as suspense-filled as all his other thrillers, all the way back to The Hunt for Red October.
B005K17RU0|5.0|has a nice and easy to navigate interface on kindle fire. radar is great. only thing they could remove is the acttivity weather feauture which is pointless.
B005S9EJ14|5.0|Love this movie.  It is so typically British (the obsession with being proper) but it was a warm and fun story.  The actors were very  good with their portrails of the characters.  I thought they overlooked some of the squalor you typically see in India's cities but it gave you some idea of the human condition.  I would highly recommend this to anyone interested in India.  Uninque concept for a retirement idea.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Got this app for my new Kindle Fire HD.  Had the app previously on my android phone.  This is so much better. Graphics looks great.  Havent played much b/c my hubby is addicted. LOL
B004132HZS|5.0|I was very skeptical about this series having been a fan of the original Holmes stories.  I was very surprised that they have done such a wonderful job of recreating Holmes in present day London.  It is fast moving, fun and funny.  The only problem with it that I can find is that frequently it is difficult to hear the dialogue which is sometimes drownd out by background noise.  We are very familiar with London and enjoy recognizing so much of it in the scenes.
B0086700CM|3.0|this is a good game but I think that u should have more choices as a character and cooler choices also acssesorize the character
B003F3FJQO|5.0|I wonder how Brenda has telepathy<br />A a a a a a a a a a a a a a
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I would recommend this to any good hearted Christian that is aware and proud of our freedoms and the many men and women that provided it.
0385360169|2.0|I first tried to read the book, but the story line moved way too slow.  I got the audiobook from the library and had to turn on music so I wouldn't fall asleep driving.  My opinion is the plot moves way too slow and is somewhat unbelievable.  I have read books from Zane and find this type of genre to be better written by Zane.  The pace moves much faster and the story lines are more realistic.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|We were so excited that Downton Abby was back on and the season 3 opener did not disappoint us. Excellent period show.  Loved Maggie Smith as usual.
B00APUYWYA|1.0|Great singing, but spoiled by the constant sexual innuendoes and scenes.  it's ridiculous.  they ruined a wonderfully musical movie with all the sexual content and nudity.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Imaginative plot + Fascinating characters + Great writing = Another winner from John Grisham. Can't wait for the next one!
1401937519|5.0|I recently finished reading Dying to Be Me by Anita Moorjani after hearing Wayne Dyer say \\"If there is one book you read this year, this should be it.\\" The book tells the story of Anita Moorjani, a medical miracle. She battled cancer for years, died on the hospital table, had a near death experience (NDE) and came back with an amazing message that healing is available to all of us. Numerous specialists have been called in and to their amazement, her cancer has disappeared completely and she is living a happy and healthy life. I am so glad I read this book and it has had a profound effect on my life.<br /><br />When I was 13 years old I experienced two drug overdoses. After the first I had some brain damage and was not able to remember anything for longer than a few seconds at a time. A few weeks later I had another overdose in which I had a near death experience (NDE). Although I didn't quite know what to make of it at that age, I still remember the experience vividly after more than two decades.<br /><br />Reading Anita's story helped me see how my experience was not just imagined. It led me into recovery and essentially healed me on many levels physically, spiritually, mentally and emotionally. I have talked about it only with very close friends over the years, but reading Anita's story helped validate my experience and opened the doorway for me to honor and begin talking about it more openly.<br /><br />Because of my own experience this book touched me in a very profound way, but Anita's message is for everyone. I applaud her courage and compassion to share this amazing story of healing with the world. If you or someone you know is in need of physical, spiritual or emotional healing - and aren't we all on some level - this really is a must read book. She has brought a bit of heaven down to earth and I hope that everyone opens their hearts and minds to the message of love that has come through.
B0015DRPJU|5.0|Just FYI, I have written other reviews on this series.  This is a great series, I'm curious to see where she goes with the main character.  I don't like how she has the main character following a man around but if she can tie it in with out diminishing the main characters strength than this will be one of the top books I recommend.  However, even though the main character is following around a man/pining over a man, she's still acting like a bad ass while doing it.  Which I can admire.  As I've said in other reviews, her actions are as a result of what she thinks she HAS to do rather than what she feels morally obligated to do.  That is what is great about her, shes is a fly-by-the-seat-of-her-pants that does what she feels is her only option because she stubbornly does not want to see any others.
B0062NAX1U|5.0|I've watched Courageous more than once, and continue to enjoy this movie.  Everyone in the family can gather around the television, and watch a great story unfold.
B004TTMYQG|1.0|It used to be great but now when I go to a meeting and don't have an internet connection, I can't use the app!  This is ridiculous.  Many of the Amazon apps are pulling this stuff.  A great reason to not purchase apps here anymore. Yes, I have the full version.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This is far and away the best free Bible app. The quality is amazing, and it's super easy to use.
B0012FHGCW|5.0|I saw this movie when it came out & I loved it! Having a friend in Alaska, I hear that Alaskans think this movie is idiotic and the guy was stupid for trying to go live up there. But being a free spirit and an idealistic dreamer, the movie really appeals to my great sense of freedom and adventure, of wanting to get away from it all and live off the land. Maybe it's a movie for dreamers, but I think other dreamers would like it.
B00AA0TJO8|3.0|Directions not very clear made for younger folks i guess This is stupid that I have to submit so many words.  If you can say it in less Why!
B000NQRR1Q|1.0|waste of money even at 4.99 ...was long and boring the end made no sense worse time spent watching a movie
B000QCS8TW|4.0|This is my first experience with this author and I'm not as impressed as I thought I'd be. His writing style, in my opinion, is a bit too simple. Sentences aren't constructed all that well and his vocabulary doesn't seem extensive. That being said I am enjoying the book more and more every time I read. It's a great story and I would recommend it it to anyone who likes this sort of medieval fantasy setting.
B000XQYM78|4.0|Ottime le condizioni della copertina, un po meno il vinile, qualche piccolo graffio ma nulla d'importante, un po di ritardo nella spedizione ma nulla di che lamentarsi

B004FGMDOQ|4.0|This book was an easy read. Had enough suspense to keep me  wanting More. I enjoy tales of the supernatural kind, and while this wasn't about ghosts or demons it was spooky. I would recommend this book to anyone wanting to escape.

B007IXWL2C|4.0|Hard to put this book down.  Not as &#34;harsh&#34; as the first book.  Enjoyed reading it and evidently I'm not the only one that did!

0446560065|4.0|Hilarious just as I expected! Book showed up on time and in great shape. Only problem came when ordering - could not ship in the same package as another Simon's Cat book.

B00005JMAH|5.0|Very good movie alone but great to watch the whole series.  Seeing how each character develops as they grow up.
B002ZTIIXK|2.0|not being very familiar with KD lang over the years, I took a chance on this CD because I had heard that she does a great job with the song Hallelulah.  That song and a couple of other are great, but did not care for the rest of the songs/arrangements.
B00004TDTO|4.0|Still love this movie, the fear of what we can't see, may be lurking underwater.  Well written and directed for it's time.  Wonder what they could do with this movie now that we have all the high tech equipment.
B005LVR6ZA|1.0|Don't believe what you read about the book<br />It sucks<br /><br />Characters aren't well developed<br />Neither is the universe that surrounds them<br /><br />Go read something else
B00005JMXX|5.0|I really loved this movie.  I watch it from time to time, and still sit intrigued.  The characters and what they go through seem relativistic to me.
B003XRELEI|5.0|Can you get tired of reading a novel that you know is going to feature Kilgore Trout at some point?<br /><br />I don't<br /><br />Kurt Vonnegut has a very sharp mind and seeps through the e-ink screen<br /><br />Hours of fun
0790729407|4.0|Son loved this movie, and plays it often and even has looked up on the net some of the history of this time.  Good movie
B001HNE3NO|5.0|very good! grabbed my attention from the start an easy read. didn't want to put it down started and finished in a few days.
B00003CXFG|4.0|Son enjoys the character of Ridick, so got Him this movie.  We both enjoyed it, and watch if from time to time.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|play it often<br />lots of ponies to choose from and lots of quests to do to pass the time.<br /><br />always looking for friends. add ridleys for this game.
B0001L3MI0|5.0|I still enjoy this movie, how it takes off from being open and wanting contact to running, then turning and fighting back.  Still watch this  movie from time to time.
B009F879HK|5.0|Beatles fans, don't let this one pass you by! A great looking (and sounding) 50th anniversary<br />reissue  that you must add to you album collection.
B009VB97EY|3.0|It was an okay movie, sexy dance moves.  Think it could have went a bit more in debt with some of the other dancers, to get the reason they do it, and their life away from the strip dancing.
B0041KVZ18|5.0|Bought a slightly flawed copy of this classic album a short time ago, but no problems with this<br />one-sounds great! Thanks to the friendly folks at Amazon for their assistance!
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|I needed a calculator nearby while on my Kindle Fire.  Convenient and easy to operate.  It also has large numbers and symbols.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I found this first book of The Hunger Games series to be very well written.  The pages fly by as Ms. Collins pulls the reader into a new world of danger, excitement, romance, and intrigue.  I  look forward to the next book with anticipation.
B00A12VJZM|5.0|I love the Stones and this is a fine collection!  Lot of songs I haven't heard before and I grew up in the 50-60s.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|I liked that its a fast read and keeps you interested.  I would recommend it to any parent.  Makes you think.
B001U3Y5XE|3.0|My 8 year old love legos so we ordered this product thinking that it will be a hit, but soon we found it a bit boring :(
B0095ZMMCK|4.0|Keeps one on the edge not wanting to put it down. Feels like you are along side the Company. Enjoyable.
B000OPPBEQ|5.0|Is the best vertion matrix!<br />is a beatiful vertion from this movie and always is a<br />best movie i saw<br />i love it
B009IEXKXI|5.0|Very simple science fiction woven with some black humor. Very detailed work, something like Asimov. I felt like I was on Mars. Highly recommended
B006LSZECO|4.0|I couldn't put it down. The \\"he says\\"/\\"she says\\" was the perfect way to suck you in. I feel almost as messed up as these two for having been this addicted to their story
B009MF56GC|5.0|Had to buy it the day it was released. Great price, came in a couple of days and i watched it that day love it.
B007GCY8FS|5.0|As always, I want more of Reacher. This book ranks up there with the best Lee has written.<br />Important note: TC was the wrong person to use.
B005Y1B3Q0|5.0|When i found out there was a directors cut i had to buy it. The packaging is great and the extra's are amazing.
1439102813|4.0|for anyone who has a person in the family who has dementia, this is a must read. For those who do not, this is also a must read. This is a story of a middle aged women who is diagnosed with alzheimers. The author is a nueroscientist so the text is rich with scientific and edical info. The novel explores the feelings of the woman as well as her family. I wish it would have looked deeper into the husbands feelings.  very informational and well done.
B008YZXYY2|5.0|I had been following the progress on this album for quite some time. When they releases the first two songs for the radio I was hooked. Corey Taylor shows every side of his talent in this album. Each song is deeply written and shows the range from the melodic to the heavy metal that is similar to his other band Slipknot. In my opinion there is not a bad song on this album.<br /><br />This is just part one of a two part album, so get this now and enjoy it while you wait for part two. Part two is supposed to release later in 2013. I can't wait for that.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This app is very easy to use. Love the note capabilities and the built in reader. Jesus' words in red. The voice of the reader is pleasing as well. Love it...and its free!
B0015DROBO|5.0|So my wife read this and thought I would really enjoy it. I was skeptical at first but after a few chapters I was hooked. I loved this book and was so glad my wife recommended this. Now I must admit that I listened to this audio book and found myself getting lost from time to time, but I was so glad to be able to talk this over with my wife. I really enjoyed the characters and the whole plot. I am going to add the next two novels to my to-read list and look forward to getting to those eventually too.
B0083P1QUM|5.0|Wow! Scarlett, always one of my favorites almost didn't make it. Thank God for friends and family. A FIVE star read!
B001NLKT60|5.0|I must thank my wife for knowing me so well, that she recommended this series to me. I finished the Girl with the Dragon Tattoo and was hooked. I waited for this to become available and dug in. Now I knew in advance that this is just part one of the story and that it is continued in the next book. Because of this I think I enjoyed it more because I wasn't waiting for a resolution or a happy ending. I was taking in all the event and characters and building the story in my mind. I can't wait to start The Girl who kicked the Hornet's nest and I hope it is just as good as the previous two.
B00AMBK0X4|4.0|This movie was SO funny. We laughed so hard we cried. If you're looking for a fun movie to watch this is a great choice.
B0031YJFCQ|4.0|I really enjoyed this series. The books were very well written and the characters drew me in so much I was then invested in their fictional lives and had to find out what happened next. This is the third book in the series and wraps it up pretty well. After reading the second book which was all set up for this one I was anxious to find out what happened.<br /><br />This book started out a bit slow because it was playing catch up where The Girl Who Played with Fire left off. Once that was finished, there was a slow build to the conclusion that was still satisfying to say the least. I really enjoyed this and have heard rumors that another author is going to finish the fourth Millennium novel Stieg Larsson was working on when he died. If this comes to pass I will anxiously await that novel as well.
B009WO7NQO|4.0|this is my favorite app but some of the levels are too hard and the millennium falcon does nothing I've only beat one level using it. make it easier and Ya got 5 stars. love the character abilities.
B0042VJ1PI|4.0|So this book is defiantly better than the first, Heat Wave. I know it is rumored to be a different writer who is ghost writing under the name Richard Castle, but this one was much more enjoyable and better written. Still basically an episode of Castle with different character names, but I liked the similarities.<br /><br />For example, it is fun to play spot the similarities. In an episode of Castle he duct tapes himself to a chair to figure out how his character will escape and be believable. Well, it was a lot of fun to see Nikki Heat in that situation and how she managed to get out. There are also aspects of the show in the book.<br /><br />This was a fun quick read and it was well written. I did enjoy it and I do love the idea of watching the fictional character (Richard Castle) in his process of writing his book. When the season is over we as fans can read the finished product. It is a very clever tie in and I want to say to the actual writer, whoever it may be, that this was a great work of fiction.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I'm addicted and its a great app my niece had it first now I have it on my phone as well as my kindle fire!
B002PEP4SC|3.0|Since I finished the first season of Castle and I became thoroughly hooked. When I saw that the book he \\"writes\\" in the show was available I jumped at the chance to read it. I knew going into it that it was following the adventures of Nikki Heat who is based off the character Detective Beckett. What I didn't realize is that it is really and episode of Castle where the names have been changed to protect the fictional. As in the tv show Heat is followed around by a journalist named Rook who is writing an article about her. I have enjoyed the similarities between the two and even that it is written by Castle. Of course no one knows who the real author is, but it is a fun idea to think of the character writing this while we watch the show. I do prefer the TV show more because I think Castle and Beckett are better characters than Heat and Rook but it was still a fun read. I am looking forward to getting to the next book in the series and would still recommend this to a Castle fan.
B000N2HBSO|5.0|Thorough, suspenseful, alive. This is a complete treatment of the times, with a good feel for the players involved, the issues facing Lincoln and the nation. I couldn't say enough about her depth of character development and how all the issues of the day related to each other. Her look at the Lincoln family, the teamwork as well as the troubled marriage etc. I highly recommend it.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Even better the second time through. Great read that I just can't put down. The next 2 books will once again be my undoing....
B0083GQ2A0|1.0|Don't waste your time or money...this movie has an awful story line and left us shaking our heads (why we had wasted the last two hours watching it)...
B005K17RU0|2.0|Not sure it's really accurate. There are so many times it says a present temperature that I'm positive is way off.<br /><br />A lot of misinformation? I never look at it anymore, thinking of deleting it.
B007PT1PEY|5.0|Arthur Conan Doyle remains at the forefront of mystery writers. I loved &#34;A Study in Scarlet&#34;! Conan Doyle has inspired other writers to create intriguing characters throughout the ages.
B00884GR0W|1.0|I downloaded this game this morning and it only downloads Block Story Lite Ad Free.  Everything I have states I purchased Block Story.  Block Story Lite shows that I haven't purchased it.  Yet, when I go to play my device only shows block story lite being installed on the device.<br /><br />How do I get it to know I have the full version of the game purchased and not the Lite version.  1 star until this is remedied.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I gave this a five star, because for me it was entertaining and kept me on the edge of my seat.

B000301YY8|3.0|I saw him on T.V. But the songs sound nothing like what you can get on the MP3. I like 1973 so when I bought Back to Bedlam the lady should have warn me about the language in the C.D.
B002RV01QI|5.0|Every once in awhile you need to have some music for calm, yet not put you to sleep.  This is it!  Not only a great voice, but good background music as well.  The Very Best of Enya.....it truly is!!

B00884GR0W|5.0|I had got this app long ago, but i saw it as the app of the day : a good pick if you ask me. There are just two things i dont get, why is the tnt never working, when i downloaded 3 months ago it said &quot;working tnt in next update&quot; 7 or more updates later, same. allso, dragons. i beat a dragon to death because my hands knocked back its attack. im just sitting there thinking &quot;FIGHT YOU DUMB DRAGON!!!&quot; i really dont get it...but it is fun. (a good app like this is survivalcraft)
B001NEK2GE|4.0|The software/set-up leaves a little to be desired and could use some streamlining, but the gameboard itself is fantastic.  May take a little time to get used to using it, but well worth it!
B000Y5JFNY|5.0|Unbelievable value on a must have classic. Saw it at Best Buy for $89. Laughed and walked away. You had it as a daily deal for $17.99! How could I pass it up?!
B0064O927I|1.0|The clock skew, The Touch is not responding properly .<br /><br />does not respond to commands, not turn the board, it is not easy to set up.

B006O6F932|4.0|Box was badly beat when it arrived and directions were worse than Ikea's but she LOVES it!  It isn't easy to move it around.  A lot of the features need to be removed before it will fold up:(
B007FIY3VW|1.0|After using this app to create an Excel document I put it back on the computer. When I opened it on with Microsoft Excel all the info I put in using the app was gone.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Great game a lot of the solitare games suck this one is really good! Love the auto finish option , also it's free!!
B000IDGDPA|1.0|This was a very poorly made and very poorly cast film.  Helen Hunt had zero charisma... she could NOT carry the film, wish I spent my evening watching bowling or something. Though some may claim the Italian setting was worth watching....this is NOT True. Go bowling, you will thank me later!
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|This game was neat. I like finding things and solving puzzles and doing brain teasers. You will too. Won't you. Yes you will.
B000AOEMXM|5.0|This may be biased, but as a fan of all things Trek, I enjoyed this series immensley. As for the set itself, good quality discs and really sturdy, attractive packages. Loved it!
B003O86FMW|5.0|Love this book. It keeps you wanting more. I could not put it down. I was shocked by many twists this book had the first didn't.
B007FEZQF8|5.0|I think this is the best zombie book ever in American  history<br />I have never read something like this !
B003JTHXOK|3.0|This book wasn't horrible but I expected a lot more out of it from the other reviews. It was very predictable to say the least. I can't imagine it being a good film at all...
B008IJTFYW|5.0|This app does exactly what is supposed to with a ln intuitive and attractive interface. The options for sounds are varied and well balanced and the ability to save favorite &quot;mixes&quot; is nice too.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|This is a fun set of games for a wide variety of people. I think we can agree that this is a good thinking game.
B000I0QL82|5.0|I love the music and dancing in this movie.  You just cannot beat Fred Astair and Bing Crosby.  It's my favorite holiday show.
B003B02O14|4.0|Captivating story and very unexpected ending. Page turner! Grisham never seems to get stale.  Unique plot and interesting resolutions for the lead character's predicaments and he did have more than one!  Good reading.
B00AMBLDEE|4.0|I liked the story and the action was pretty good.  I thought it ended too abruptly, but I guess it sets up the next one.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|Bought this CD as a gift for one of my friends and they LOVE it! I also watch the Piano Guys' videos on Youtube all the time and their music is fantastic. You won't be disappointed.
B003MC5N28|5.0|I am so excited to finish the series.  I thought I remembered The Giver, but I was pleasantly surprised by how much I enjoyed it the second time and I never wanted it to end.
034580404X|5.0|I bought this because the price was right, and am an avid reader.  Love the story of Christian and Ana!!!  Haven't read a romance in quite some time, but this is good!  Hard to put down, recommend this if you like romance and erotica!
B0063GORYU|2.0|Installed this on my Samsung  galaxy player after reading description. Had a version of this on my computer and thought it was the same. Wrong. Not nearly as good. Already uninstalled it. Lesson learned.
B003NTSBUG|5.0|have to see it more than once  - once you see the ending you have to know more about what happened in the rest of the movie. many plot twists - cant say any more it would give it away
B004EFYZ1C|5.0|Down loaded this free APP. for the moon. Looks great, shows you all the information you could want on the moon and more. Good learning tool for kids interested in space.

B0034G4P8A|5.0|What can I say about this movie? I like it. Looks great on my plasma and runs fine in my player.
030758836X|4.0|When I read the first half of the book, I couldn't figure out why it was so popular. I'm into the second half now and am enjoying it more. It is finally getting to be a page turner.

B007ZGBZHE|5.0|A riveting novel of intrigue, suspense, dark secrets and revenge.  A must read for all Pendergast aficionados and all connoisseurs of spell binding tales.
B005CRQ2DK|5.0|My daughters love these books. They are great beginner books for kids to read. Not to mature for 7+ year olds at all.
B00A7OJ0DC|5.0|First, I'm not going to comment on how Disney has or has not gotten worse or better through the years. I'll leave that discussion for people who care more about it than I do. I'm just interested in the movie itself and I think it was a great one.  Anyone who played games when they were younger, or if you have kids now who like to play games should watch this movie. If in the least, you'll get a kick out of seeing the &#34;bad guys&#34; counsel each other. The creative team behind the movie deserves some recognition in creating a believable background in how different games can interact with each other. It may seem like just a simple stretch of the imagination, but they pulled it off really well.  The rendering was extremely good and the subtle inclusions of characters you'll recognize are fun to watch for. Personally I was looking for Ryu since I was a huge Street Fighter fan growing up. If you expect just the kids to enjoy this, you'll be glad you're wrong. The movie is geared to audiences of all ages and especially for families. The plot uses a Toy Story-esque approach to the life of the characters, but this movie makes it its own.  If you're looking for a family safe fun movie you can watch whenever, you'll be glad you have this.
B007MU85D0|5.0|Wow, another great band coming up and exploding. I love their creativity. I'm really really really into this kind of music!!!!! They grab your mind and sould and sooth it with their unique sound. BUY THIS, TRUST ME....
B00A9X9ORI|3.0|if you cant find anything else.  It is decent entertainment for a time you cant find anything on TV.  It was hard to follow.<br /><br />I will say that I did like the ending.  Even I am sure others would have been angry.
B007M45PMU|5.0|Wow, another great band coming up and exploding. I love their creativity. I'm really really really into this kind of music!!!!!
B009ZQ8FQG|2.0|a little disappointing--mary's character lost its depth.  She is back to the superficial aggressive money grabbing girl we thought she had shed during the war. script has difficulties too --Shirley Mac is too crass, overdone.  Lord Grantham also comes off as a doddering fool.
1449415881|5.0|Purchased for my Brother in law, always get him a calendar for Christmas and everyone loves Dilbert, would purchase again
B000Y5JFNY|5.0|Comes with a music box that plays &#34;These Are A Few of My Favorite Things&#34;, and comes with the 45th anniversary soundtrack!! Also the book is filled with bunch of facts about the movie, than any fan would love to read!
B005OCFGTO|4.0|Purchased for my Harry Potter granddaughter, and she was very pleased, she did make the remark that one of the disk did skip, but all in all was satisfied
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I'm a hopeless romantic. This series continues to engage my heart and my mind. I love the people and I am constantly looking at their attire and surroundings. I am delighted at the way the characters have grown over the past two seasons and am looking forward to season 3.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Best ever!  I am so excited to get to watch the second season.  I can't wait to get caught up and begin watching the 3rd.
B009VLX8FS|5.0|I love this CD!  I purchased it for my daughter, and then I ended up listening to it as well!
B004J64QSI|5.0|This production of Les Mis showcases some of the BEST vocal performances I have ever seen!  Alfie Boe is absolutely BRILLIANT as &#34;Jean Valjean&#34; and, doesn't miss anything!  His rendition of &#34;Bring Him Home&#34; is beyond breathtaking and the finale, featuring a quartet of Jean Valjeans, including Colm Wilkinson from the original 1985 cast, is AMAZING!  To be clear to potential buyers, this presentation of Les Mis is a concert performance, and, therefore, does not feature the usual dramatic acting and cast interactions you would expect in a typical musical theatre production.  Not including the finale, this performance is also shorter as a few, less essential, elements have been cut from the production in the interest of saving time.  Despite the concert format, each performer still manages to deliver a wonderful dramatic performance, albeit in front of a stage microphone.  Lea Salonga as &#34;Fantine&#34;, Norm Lewis as &#34;Javert&#34; and several favorites from London's West End including Ramin Karimloo and Hadley Fraser, round out this spectacular cast that bring this musical to life in a truly memorable performance that you will want to see again and again!  One common criticism folks have regarding this production is Nick Jonas, as &#34;Marius&#34;.  I think he does tend to sound a little too &#34;pop-y&#34; at times for what is essentially a modern opera, but does well overall.  I made the mistake of watching this production before seeing the new movie version of Les Mis- so the vocal performances in the movie were extremely disappointing in comparison (and that's putting it mildly).  If you have already seen the movie, I suggest that you buy or rent the 25th Anniversary production of this powerful musical if you would like to experience what the music of Les Mis is meant to be like: powerful, emotional and vividly spectacular!
B00A6PD9I4|5.0|We love this movie.  The whole family enjoyed this flick. Reminded me of my independent little girl.  Even daddy enjoyed this one, and gramma bought it for us for Christmas since we enjoyed it so!
B007TNS6JI|4.0|My only complaint it the movement system. The knob in the screen just doesn't cut it for me. It was frustrating enough to lose a star but the rest of the game is fun enough that I will probably play off and on.
B001IBIHQ4|3.0|I'm a history buff, and WWII specially. I found that 'Band of brothers' was more history-related than 'The Pacific', it's was overall good.
B008FPZQQU|5.0|The DVD audio 5.1 disc is an execellent demo disc for surround music.  As for the music itself, it sets the direction that ELP would follow for the next several albums.  If you like ELP, get this.
B0028RXXE8|5.0|History of a family that will do anything to maintain power. Based on some historical facts and others not so much, is very entertaining. The production is excelent.
B007QXU0ZO|5.0|Why is it that Edward Sharpe has not made a DVD - apart from the excellent 'Big Easy Express'. It is impossible not to feel filled with this thing called life when listening to this music. Big Easy Express introduced me to this group plus Mumford and Sons - wonderful stuff
B007HACDLK|4.0|I am a huge Vince Flynn fan and his llatest Mitch Rapp novel was a great read. After a couple of retrospectives of the super spy's early career\\" Last Man\\" brings our hero back to today with a plot that could have been plucked straight from the headlines. Geat action and political intrigue.Vince Flynn fans won't be dissapointed
B003NHRIVQ|3.0|Nice story and great images.  The actors all did a good job with what they were given.  Sit back and just enjoy this one.  Do not over analyze anything and enjoy this with some popcorn.
B005KELQEU|5.0|Kindle fits good and there is enough padding to protect device.  Bought it for my 90 year old mom who loves to read.
B004LWZW9C|4.0|The cast does a great job and you will have some fun with this one.  The bloopers are funny also.
B004UFEJS0|5.0|Fast shipping and great Christmas deal! The kids love it!  My husband will even watch the whole thing with the kids.  Now THATs saying something for a kids movie!
B005K0HDGE|5.0|The trials and tribulations of George Amberson will hold every bit of your attention in a vice-like grip. You will be immersed in the past, not just a visitor, but a member.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I absolutely loved this book from the moment I started reading it I couldn't stop. I loved all the emotions I felt through this book it is a definite must read!
076781214X|5.0|Enjoyed it! DVD played with no problem on my player. Good movie with a great cast. Kathleen Turner really rocked it.
0321344758|5.0|All web developers and web project managers should read this.  Don't make things so darn complicated.  Your users will thank you.
B004QX07G4|5.0|Seriously...I'm Kidding -  Made me laugh out loud and when in public reading controlled it to a chuckle.  I love the way her mind works.
0399230033|5.0|just love this book<br />the detail is great and the succession of on-going characters that make it a great read
B00AA0TJO8|5.0|simple graphics straight forward play.  I've told everyone i know with Android to download.  its a great mind clearer when switching from one project to the next.
B000SEJHRA|1.0|I thought this book would get better as I read on, when in fact it got worse.  Wouldn't recommend it at all.
B00631VJIC|5.0|This CD arrived on time, (before Christmas) and was exactly as described. The CD and the case were both in good shape. I was happy with this purchase.
1451648537|4.0|This book is really two biographies in one. The first biography of course is on Steve Jobs himself, the second on the computer industry as a whole. New readers should get ready for a little crazy ride in this terrific biography. AS others before me have stated his flaws in personality and other perceived issues as a result the thing to keep in mind here is that this lended to his intelligence. We wouldn't have the products today that we have if it weren't for people like Jobs and nor his successful counterpart Gates for that matter.<br /><br />I enjoyed this book but I have to admit my one and only &#34;issue&#34; was with the drug use from time to time. I saw Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak at the California US Festival in the early 1980s. As a kid then it is hard to imagine the products later we use as a result of genius minds and hard work efforts to push the envelope. Pushing the envelope is never done inside a neat little box - keep an opened mind and you too will enjoy this biography.
B008K6HN8I|5.0|can store, export from FB , email files  good pdf program to read files. easy to use glad I got it.
B00AA0TJO8|5.0|My 6 year old son loves this game. I know that most people think that it may just be mindless play but it really engages the child to use their problem solving skills.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|able to search for favorite passages, can bookmark easy to read print,  gives definations of words. Glad I got it.
B000V9KFLY|4.0|Celin Dion, need I say more? Her talent is world class. I love that this album is a holiday one and mixed with traditional songs as well as non-traditional ones as well. Only thing is that It doesn't come with a hard CD case. I still store my CDs the old school way, so having a hard case would've been helpful. But as song and talent material go, awesome!
1615470158|5.0|My advice to anyone interested or considering optimization of their data analysis or organization strategies is to buy this book. In entertainingly basic English, Rob Collie lays out simple steps on how to not only set-up your computer for use of PowerPivot but how to import your existing data and start playing around with new ways to look at it. I had been using a variety of platforms and custom scripts to work on my data but now will never go back. And I'll have this sweet book along the way as a reference guide.<br /><br />This sweet and simple book is packed with loads of super useful tips and tools. After getting through the first chapters I had already gotten my money's worth in terms of time saved on a recurrent issue I had been having. I sat back in my chair and thought, 'man, I wish I would have known this before now! As a testament to how useful this book is, I even bought an extra copy to keep in a communal book shelf for my staff.
B004MPESSY|5.0|this movie is totally awesome, and the ending is perfect!!! very violent, and the plot keeps u on your toes
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|This game is really fun and challenging well worth the small amount of change it  caust will defiantly will be getting more
B0016BPWNM|5.0|this has always made me laugh and now my son loves it too, and bluray makes it even better :-)
B0053O89KG|5.0|Mezcla de comicidad, drama, suspenso. La interactuación de los protagonistas tiene mucha complicidad, y el resto del reparto le da el toque necesario para que cada capitulo sea interesante y entretenido.
B0000AK7AC|5.0|This is one of my very favorite moves to watch, and now my 3 yr old loves it too, the animals really seem to talk, and very good story line , all around great family movie
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|Great plot twist at the end every one should read this series. And in fall House of games comes out for those of you who didn't know.
B001UV4XIS|5.0|Part 2 was so much better than Part 1.  Wish the author would continue with the children of Harry and friends.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Thank you Suzanne Collins for this amazing series. There are no words to describe my enjoyment in reading these three books.
B002KQ6BT6|4.0|This is classic Dan Brown. Not as good as angels and demons but still very interesting. Very well worth it.
0345803485|5.0|Great book! I have never read a book like this, and I cannot wait to read the next two books in the series. I wasn't going to read this at all, but after hearing several other women talk about how they had to wake up their husbands, after reading the book at bedtime, because they just couldn't control themselves, I decided that I wanted to see what all the excitement was about. Wow, this is so Not Me, and I love it! I have a smile on my face, and I find myself looking men straight in the eye, as I am talking to them, wondering what they are thinking, while I am talking to them. Could they have desires like Christian? Haha???? I also find myself wondering if, when I am looking them in the eye, if they can read my mind and know what I'm thinking. I am enjoying me, and all that the mysteries of this book have opened up.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|This book is awesome , interesting , and religious. Not good for young children. Still awesome . Please read. Good book
B007GCY8FS|3.0|The book is similar to the others in Child's series.  It gets a three stars because it's expensive.  It should have come down in price by now.
B000HEWEJO|5.0|This is a great version of a great film! A lot of people are talking about different audio and sound quality; I don't know much about that.  Compared with the typical TV broadcast on Christmas Eve, it was clearer and easier to understand.  Cheap, excellent, all around a great value<br /><br />Also, despite the color jacket art, the movie is in classic black and white. Just like mom used to make
B002IFT1ZA|4.0|The makers of this version of Game of Thrones has succeded in making films that corresponds very good with my dream pictures in my head when reading the book. Good work! I would have preferred a movie instead of a television serie, though, but that is probably a feeling due to having read all the books so far.
B00A0SKFLG|4.0|What a thriller.  Colin Farrell did a great job.  I liked it better then the 1st Total Recall with Arnie.
9889979942|4.0|I bought this book because it consists a tiny little documentation of the China that was. A China that now is fast disappearing. And though the words are few, it has a lot of information about that China. It is realistic, and it is a good reflection of the parts of the China I once visited. I hope that China itself has documented much, much more, and that I may become able to share that info in the future, but this book is also a trustworthy source of that past. I especially like it's clear documatation of where we are and what we see in the big country from the beginning to the end.
B00A9C3RB8|5.0|Tommy Lee Jones and Meryl Streep were perfect.  The movie really made you sit back and contemplate your marriage and how anyone's marriage could take a turn like theirs did.
B0076DELIG|5.0|Lucid, clear, point by point transfer through the unraveling of the evidence that was stagnant for more than 20 years. The novel is laced with moments of high anxiety, when all appears to be ending for Bosch....and finally to a marvelous conclusion. A great book!
B009VB9VKY|2.0|Why on earth did Matthew M. even both with this film?  He was such a sleeze bag.  So unlike anything else he has ever done.  All in all, the film was boring!
B005IQZB14|5.0|Equally Humorous/light and also disturbing/moving. All together beautifully written and an exceptionally important read. Most will see  themselves in her failures and fears and be challenged and inspired by her monumental achievement.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I don't even know where to begin...<br />  I love this book. I love Dean Holder and the best first kiss in the history of first kisses. I love Sky. I love everything about her.<br />The true sign of a good book is when you read it you not only fall in love with the characters, plot, etc... but you become immersed in them. Your heart swells when theirs swell and breaks when theirs break. There was one point in this book when I had to put my kindle down and \\"take a chapter break\\". I just couldn't read the words I knew were coming.<br />Colleen Hoover has quickly been added to my favorite authors and I cannot wait to read the other books she has written.<br /><br />I don't know if reviews are actually read by the author but if they are....Thank you for sharing your amazing story with me. One of the best I have ever read.
B005HSL626|5.0|What a great game!!  My little girl who is 3 and I play often. She calls the game \\"whack a fruit\\". She loves it!
B00A9C3RB8|1.0|This was a terrible movie.  I would have expected more from Meryl Streep and Tommy Lee Jones.  Great actors - they do pull off the roles well enough - but really? Come on - someone actually made a movie on this??? ugh.  Would not waste my money.
0553801473|5.0|loved this book read it in about three days, cant wait for the next in the series check it out
B005KELQEU|4.0|Was looking for an inexpensive case to hold my usb cable and any other &#34;small&#34; that I might want when reading or storing my Kindle. This was perfect.
B009IQ0TGM|5.0|Each song is unique and has its own character. Her voice and lyrics fit perfectly with the music. This is just the beginning of Ellie Goulding.
B008LC8TJI|5.0|I rarely buy any CD's, but was very happy to have purchased this one. Maroon 5 is good and<br />the music helps me to get up and get going - it's especially good when you want some music<br />to get you up and cleaning the house!
1611748755|5.0|The life of Pi starts off slow, but as the boy is is left on a lifeboat with a Bengal Tiger, it gets very interesting on how he survives.  This is a great adventure tale, and I enjoyed the reading of by native Indian.<br /><br />Recently this was released as a film that was nominated for many Oscars, so it shows some of the strength of the story.
B0047O2FDA|5.0|This is my favorite sweet tooth cookbook. This was the first time that I bought a book online and had it downloaded to kindle on my phone. I was so easy, and i was able to use it within 5 minutes.
0451196716|5.0|This was my third SK's book. The more I read his stories, the more I love his spectacular ability to write wonderful fiction novels. The Long Walk is not just a perfectly written story, it's also a novel that combines terror, desire, humanity, goals, competition, survival, death, cruelty and so many wonderful characters, that is impossible not to identify with one of them. The story itself compels you to keep reading until the exhausting end, which is left open to our imagination and creativity. Still, it left me wanting to know more about certain things, but overall it's an extraordinary story. Definitely recommended.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|It's a game I can play and so can my grandson. Would recommend it. I got it on my new Kindle Fire and wanted something other than books.
B0083ZBW2Y|4.0|Jack London's &#34;The Call of the Wild&#34; is a great depiction of the natural instinct which call to his origins
B002MQYOFW|4.0|Quick, enthralling read!! The story was incredible and the characters endearing! I recommend this book to anyone who enjoys a good love story!
B008KYOCA2|5.0|I wanted a apps that is not totally pendent on a connection to aomeone else.  This one satisfied the requirements.
B0084U0IEG|2.0|Maybe because of my Anglican roots and as a PK myself, I thought the depiction of this clergy family distressing. But if you want drugs, sex and violence read it.
B0071XO8RA|3.0|I did not care for the story line.  Not my type of book.  Would not recommend.  blah, blah, blah, blah
B0083P1QUM|3.0|I was disappointed with this book  I have not read a Scarpetta story in along time. I don't like it when she gets so introspective. I guess I'm just one of those old guys, just the facts Ma'am.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Anything Nicholas Sparks writes is wonderful.  I would recommend it to anyone who loves a good love story that is believable.
B007VUCAVO|5.0|I like this app because, every time the battery is running low on my Kindle it let me see the percentage of it. I recommended it because that app  truly does the job. Thank you
B002WV5A9G|4.0|I have always enjoyed the Star Trek series, in its many forms.  Its clear the producers were looking to add to an already large audience.  The time travel component to the movie allows for a redefinition of an old story.  It is well played, the actors are fresh and exciting.  It was a very good stand alone movie.  My one worry is, how do they manitain the original integrity of the movie series with their new altered universe without a planet Vulcan or Capt. Kirk not having a biological father to raise him.  These are unanswered questions until we see the next movie.
B0093H8H8I|4.0|This is a pretty good buy if you can get over Intel's attitude with regard to pricing (we are Intel, and you will pay us lots of money!). The HD4000 graphics core is excellent for HTPCs and light gaming.<br /><br />I have this running xbmc on xubuntu 12.04 at 1920x1080 on my 40in. TV and it plays HD media without a hiccup. Even more impressive, xbmc's vaapi support is broken until the new version comes out and this processor laughs and plays 1080p blu rays on CPU decoding with no graphics acceleration!<br /><br />It also has enough horsepower than I can emulate up to PS2 and Gamecube games on the same machine. Emulators are notorious for being buggy and poorly optimized (with some exceptions). Not all games run smoothly but I think upgrading to a 64-bit OS will fix that. Any console games before the PS2, GC, and Xbox era emulate perfectly and the CPU doesn't even break a sweat.<br /><br />Huge upgrade from the Atom-ION setup I replaced. This is the perfect CPU for an HTPC right now. Beefy enough to run all your videos in HD, play a few games, and it runs cool. The only things which are close are the AMD APUs. I might've gone in that direction if I was running windows. AMD graphics drivers suck in Linux and there are lots of problems with HDMI audio output. Intel has better Linux support so I went with this. Aside from the price being a bit high I can find no faults!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Omg! I finished this book in a day! What an awesome read. I was instantly hooked. I loved the story, the characters, the ending.
B000FC2KL0|4.0|I am a fair-weather fan of The Red Hot Chili Peppers and was familiar with some of their most popular songs (greatest hits). However, when I saw this book for about $4 on Amazon, I checked it out.  While I was familiar with the bassist, Flea, I had no idea who Anthony Kiedis was and therefore decided to learn a little more about the history of this group and the lead singer.<br /><br />1.  What a screwed up life Anthony has had.  In and out of drug rehabs, lots of girlfriends, the creation and growth of the RHCP.  But what a great tell all story.  I spent a lot of time checking out you tube videos of their earlier stuff and really enjoyed the music.<br />2. Lots of drugs...oh, I mentioned that.<br />3. Lots of sex...oh, I mentioned that too.<br /><br />And I learned a lot about the history and growth of this group.<br /><br />For those who didn't know, Kiedis is not a natural singer and fell into the role initially because of his stage presence.  But, wow, how he has developed.<br /><br />Great read, though sometimes disturbing.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|Great job Rick Riordan!  I am a huge fan of the original Percy Jackson series and although it's doesn't have the same appeal as the first five books, this series dose not disappoint! I am in middle school and I think second to tenth graders should read this book!
B00A9C3RB8|2.0|It was ok but I had higher hopes for the movie. It didn't seem to really explore how they got where they were. Sort of glossed over....ok ending and some light moments. Trailer definitely better than the movie.
3836503050|5.0|really great book for tattoo inspiration. I would recoomend it as well for anyone interested in history of advertising .
B008FYZIVY|5.0|The writing, acting and production are all first-rate! The quality of the DVDs also were great. I highly recommend it!
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Couldn't put he book down. Easy read that was interesting, insightful, and motivational. Definitely recommend reading if you enjoy military novels.
B000002AGN|5.0|This is the recording that broke the rules and put the Dave Brubeck Quartet on the map. Any fan of jazz must own this one and you'll love it every time it's played.
B003P2WO5E|5.0|I picked up this book as something to read between the long gaps between the wheel of time books.<br /><br />Now, I am reading the wheel of time books to fill the time between now and the release of the next book.<br /><br />I am impressed. Loved it. Highly original, imaginative, suspenseful, simply everything you want in a good book.
1608862801|4.0|Just like the show, the story is colorful, weird and wonderful.  I bought this for my son who loves the show, and he raced through it, but he keeps going back to it.
B00785P2QC|4.0|build your own fun city kindda sucks as you have to figure out route for every business dont much tosaybut give it a go ifyour board
1454701250|5.0|This is a very inspirational book. I used the ideas to create my own holiday cards and I am incorporating &#34;stamping&#34; into my original artwork.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I can't wait for the second half of the season. It's an amazing show. I would recommend it to all my friends.
B00884GR0W|1.0|They're seriously some of the most blatantly fabricated testimonials I have ever seen on the amazon app store. Where are the bad reviews? Because this clone (with lol added features) sucks.
B00AIGQTEC|1.0|I'm not digging the lyrics especially. It seems like since Prince has joined the Jehovah's Witnesses his lyrics have suffered mightily. This song is the latest example. His singing sounds bored, uninterested and uninspired. I have never heard his voice sound so dead and flat. Prince's voice has never sounded bad on any of his recordings, until now. I have all of his official stuff and even a few boots. His delivery has always been effortlessly spectacular, that is.... until now. What happened? I know Prince is past 50 and I'm not one to speak against a man's spirituality, but Prince's art is clearly suffering because of the religion that he is currently involved in. It's like he's looking over his shoulder when he writes his songs now. It seems like he's writing lyrics to cater to whoever the powers-that-be are in the religion. Just my opinion, of course, but, Prince you need to be re-inspired. You need to get back to being you.
0684847248|5.0|This book is excellent to help you overcome mental problems that you are overcomming in your life and is a must read.
B00ARI9CDQ|2.0|Inconsistent scrolling, speeds up when I'm trying to go slow, and not enough content easily accessible from the &#34;home page&#34;.  I'd rather just go to the mobile Daily Mail site.
B005KJJ4F8|5.0|Very surprised I couldn't put this book down.  I will be getting the next one when it comes out. Awesome novel.
B0094BB4TW|3.0|It's nice having the app on my phone, but since downloading it, I have noticed an annoying lag in navigation on my phone even while the app isn't &#34;open&#34;
B006KX3GXO|5.0|I love this app its got some really cool pictures on it you can follow people than can follow back everyones really nice you can edit pictures and draw on it ITS LIKE 4 APPS IN ONE!!!! I love it I highly recommend it :)
B00AF6MF9I|4.0|great game I especially enjoy the way combat is handled. the graphics are great also. give it a try. I guarantee you're going to like it.
B004I744AS|5.0|This it the best dictionary app i have!!! Im a well satisfied, over intelligent, american consumer!!! This is a must-get app for those people that just wanna learn more!!!
B0058Z4NR8|4.0|This book offers a revealing  study on the origins of prosperity in the democratic countries. I would give it the fifth star if this clear message was a bit shorter.
B001M5UDGS|5.0|First of all, this is the best film in existence, must see for everyone. Secondly, it's such good value, that it was cheaper for me to import this across to the UK, than buy the dvd with my area code. Thirdly, it does work on any DVD player, which is awesome!
B003VANOFY|5.0|He calificado cinco estrellas a este producto debido a que me llegó en buenas condiciones sin ningún tipo de novedad al respecto Gracias
B00004CZPF|3.0|Great quality and sound. Wish it was in American format.  Had to have a tech friend convert it to US
B007EDYN36|5.0|After Ace and Gene wrote their autobiographies you just knew it was inevitable that there was going to be at least one more coming out. I have to say I have been a KISS fan most of my life and the books that have been coming out on the band have been enlightening and disturbing. I would have to say Peter Criss has officially set the bar. Where there was some degree of civil disagreement and minor insults (and some not so minor) in Gene and Ace's books, Peter Criss does NOT hold back!!! He exposes the dark under belly of what it was like being in the bubble of the KISS machine and the endless use of drugs, women, and &#34;loss of reality&#34;. Peter does not even avoid describing his antics and in many ways has opened himself up to much ridicule and hostility. However, if you have read the other autobiographies you have to give this one a chance. At the end of the book I am not sure you will love, hate or be indifferent to him but you will sit back and go &#34;WOW&#34; when you are done. I know I am still in shock.
B007B6VOG0|5.0|I was unsure if I was going to like the whole album, and to my delight its amazing.  Each some is very different and pleasant to listen to.  Fun songs to workout to as well!!
B00A8ECU24|5.0|My 5yr old loves it. It doestake up some memory. Don't use your gems to skip. Its hard to earn them without spending money. Game is fun for kids.,
B004JZBGWI|5.0|Have used this for as long as I have had Android, works well and syncs on all devices plus it is free!
B005FITIDC|5.0|good movie....makes you wish you could go help him! It has touched the lives of so many people I know.
B0051UP5NQ|4.0|I bought this because I have Microsoft Office Professional on my main computer and wanted something similar for the e tablet..As with any new program the more you use it the more familiar you become with it.  At fiirst I found it difficult to edit on such a small screen until I took two fingers and enlarged the type a more managable size.  I would love it if there was a quick run through to show some quick tips before you use it.
B008ELUEQC|5.0|preordered soon as i could! arrived in very timely manner and price was the best. i admit i would like ROD reading, whistling and or singing the phonebook. love this album because it is his 1st Holiday / Christmas cd!! love the duets and the song he wrote for the album  THANK YOU ROD
0765325950|5.0|I'm disappointed by everyone using the reviews to rate this work badly because it was not released in an eBook at the same time. SHAME on all those people - What would Robert Jordan make of your actions??<br /><br />Yes, an eBook would have been nice, but then again, I would have gladly purchased the hard cover, the audio,  and the eBook. I already have the Hard Cover and the Audio and will likely get the eBook - depending on actual price it's offered at. I love these books on audio because of their length but I read so much faster the written page. Hard to drag a hard back of this size around at lunch time or on the bus.<br /><br />That being said - I'm so sad to see this series over but it was an amazing ending. Others have written very good reviews, mine will be general.<br /><br />Things I loved - Oh too many things to really count. Nearly everything with Min and Matt. And what can I say; I love the fate Cadsuane appears to be in store for.<br /><br />Things I didn't like - It was the last battle and boy was there a lot of battles and fighting. I'm not really into war/battle heavy books so I did dislike reading so much of it. I looked forward to the sections not in the thick of fighting.<br /><br />Another thing that, is so Robert Jordan is the massive amount of plots spun together - and it seemed to me that there was supposed to be ALOT more to do with the people of Shara and what was happening there. But it would have likely snowballed into another 2 or 3 books and at least a 6 more subplots ;)<br /><br />In the end, I'm so very happy to have read this work, I'm sad that there will be no more new books in this series, it may not be the ending some hoped for, and certainly we all wish Mr. Jordan could have finished crafting the books himself..<br /><br />...but this is an ending...<br /><br />And personally, I believe a wonderful ending!
B00632HWOG|5.0|Can check emails anywhere at the touch of a button. Headlines of emails are displayed when I connect to the internet!  Can't ask for much better than that!<br />Would definitely recommend this.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This novel through me threw twisted and turns.  Made me cry, laugh, and so much more.  Really takes you to another place.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|This is my &#34;go to&#34; game when I have 30 mins or more to spare!  Stress free and fun! Similar lines to bejewelled.<br />Would recommend it to anyone!
B009FZHYKU|5.0|This show actually has a good storyline and the graphics are great! The characters really make the show. Great way to mix it up!!
B0064X7FVE|5.0|I wouldn't leave home without this app!  I check on it throughout the day or just to see how my drive to or from work will be.  Very accurate!
B0050PYNP8|4.0|Graphics very nice and the humor rocks! Some scenes just make you laugh out loud. Definately not for the younger kids!
B004SIIBGU|5.0|All I do is click on the app!  Presto.. my ebay account is right there at my whim, where ever I am!<br />Would recommend this to any regular ebayer!!
B009O07NMA|5.0|This is a great CD.  I Listen to it over and over again.  Florida Georgia line is a great country band!
B0034DGPEU|5.0|once I got used to the writting/dialect I couldn't put down the book. An amazing story of hardships & violence people faced back in those days & how Family & love helped them survive
B007J4T2G8|2.0|This book is good to a point.. good if you love reading the same intimate scenes over and over. The author uses the same words over and over for the sex scenes. It doesn't seem real at all its basically a \\"oh yeah in and out and omg I'm spiraling into a Deep orgasm.\\" And the ending... sucked. The abuse...sucked.. just a weird book all around.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Grabs you and does not let go.  Great book.  Glad there other two are already out.  Cannot wait to read them too
B003YCIE68|5.0|Great movie from when I was a kid! Sometimes you remember a movie or a show from when you were a kid and then you watch it when you are older and it's not as good, that's not this movie, still just a good!!!
B0058VW36U|5.0|Cut the Rope is fun and challenging! Sometimes it's frustrating, but I think its good for my brain. I've never had any issues!
0385535139|5.0|I Simply love it. It tell everyone that what seens to be so good, can be a nightmare. The way of sucess is work hard.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|A beautifully told story, I laughed out loud, and cried shameless tears...thank you for a wonderful story. I would definitely recommend this book to anyone and everyone.
B008WCP2PG|5.0|Huge hit - mindless fun video to watch.  Gave it as a gift and had lots of laughs with family and friends.
B005LAIGIM|5.0|This movie is very entertaining most of the time and has a clearly defined plot. Eddie Murphy is one of those actors/comediens that has the ability to pull off the movie without you being disappointed at the end. It's not an Academy Award nominee but at the same time it's light and entertaining and isn't that all we ask of a flick!
B004ZZS4CC|5.0|I could not put this book once I started. It made me cry it made me laugh. It is written in such a positive style that it became very inspirational to me. Bravo Jaycee and thank you for showing us how to live through horrible situations with  dignity and grace.
B008AK8FHM|3.0|Perhaps I was expecting something different from this book. This was more about scientific explanations, than his encounter with heaven. He explained his NDE rather quick and the remainder of the book was scientific comparisons (which he summed the whole process up in 9 key points in the end).
B0076DCT2G|5.0|I love DeMille's sense of humor.  I particularly like his character, John Corey.  His books are interesting, informative, and entertaining.  They're not classics by any means but are a good, fun read.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I can't believe how awesome these books are and I am so excited for the movie to come out!! These are a great read.
B005RUUUAI|5.0|This is an intense and somewhat realistic thriller.  The characters are fairly well written and the characters that die surprise you.  It helps bring you into the shock and horror of the premise.
B002VPE1WK|5.0|Bought this for my husband for Christmas because he has nothing to store his Nikon camera in. Love the different storage compartments and amount of padding.
B009FZHYKU|4.0|I would like to see a bit more &#34;realism&#34; in the sense that people are killing zombies in this show with farm implements like they are sliding a hot knife through butter.  They need to go easier on the CGI effects, concentrate on the story.
B00AYB0TOW|5.0|Plenty of other reviewers have already said everything possible on what's right about this movie so I'll keep my comments brief.<br /><br />I really wanted to like the Stallone version, which was terrible, yet did have a lot of great things in it.  It was just ruined by Hollywood camp and overproduction.<br /><br />This version more than atones for the sins of its predecessor. Story mechanics were basic and uncomplicated, but well managed. Casting was spot-on. Special effects were excellent, with no indication of a smaller budget. In fact, in light of the excesses of Michael Bay or Roland Emmerich, the lack of gratuitous CG was refreshing and provided a greater sense of authenticity.<br /><br />The action and violence (which was plentiful and frequently gruesome) was also stylized and at times surprisingly elegant.<br /><br />The characters were treated with respect by the film, showing personality, integrity, and thoughtfulness. No cliches or cardboard cutouts here.<br /><br />In all, everything I could have hoped for in a Dredd movie. Yet another indicator of how independent studios are breathing new life into an industry that all too often gets it wrong.<br /><br />More like this one please!<br /><br />My only criticism has nothing to do with the movie and everything to do with the Amazon instant rental. First, I wanted to watch the movie in HD, which they charge extra for. Then, because I'm trying to watch it using my laptop (High End MacBook with very fast Fiber internet), HD isn't available, though it would be on an array of other lower-end devices (Kindle, XBox, etc.) This is annoying and difficult to understand. At times the streaming was laggy, and just plain locked up, causing me to have to restart my browser and resume, which screws up the whole experience. When I can rent the same movie from RedBox for a buck, and have a much higher quality experience, the convenience premium starts to get weak. Amazon should fix this.
B008CP6RWU|5.0|Beautiful.<br />I've never experienced anything like it, like stepping into another world. I would't miss the opportunity to play this game if I were you. It is divine in a spiritual way.

B001EN71DQ|5.0|my daughter went through a SW phase where she loved the clone wars and prequels and so I got this and the other clone wars stuff for her and she loved it all at the time. she has since out grown it but she loved it at the time.

B000ATQYT2|5.0|I thought it was SO CUTE and I grew up with the muppets and I have made sure that my kids watched it and they love the muppets too and so I got this for them and they watch it still to this day around christmas and they are all teenagers now.
0765325950|3.0|Sanderson should be commended for bringing this task to its conclusion, resolving dozens of subplots and linking up to the ending Robert Jordan had envisioned. At times his imitation of Jordan's style is too flattering though, as here we have all the recurring flaws of the Wheel of Time books - recurring catchphrases and forced banter among them, although there is less discussion of hats and robes - present and accounted for.    This is a fast read though. After all the complaints about the length of time to finish the series, it is ironic that fans may wish Sanderson had spent more time on certain characters for this last book. Still an ending is an ending and hopefully the publisher will not be tempted to throw in a sequel title a couple of years down the line.    [...]
B002L3RVCY|5.0|my daughter went through a SW phase where she loved the clone wars and so I got this and the other clone wars stuff for her and she loved it all at the time. she has since out grown it but she loved it at the time.
B004SEUJ82|5.0|This was a VERY powerful movie.  It told the history we have been taught, but it includes the emotional aspect, allowing us to have an idea of the horridness of what occurred.  I think this should be shown in history classes, when the kids are seniors in high school.  They still might not be mature enough, but I think the reality of this movie is something that could powerfully affect the next generation.  I am disgusted that people held those beliefs, and I commend the director, for giving us, a small view of what occurred.

B001EN71DG|5.0|if you are a fan and do not already have the set then you are not a SW fan that is just fact. So for the new fans who need a set this is a great gift idea or even just to buy for yourself.
B007URVZJ6|5.0|I used this book to get me started, and I'm glad that KDP actually provided this.  Since publishing on Kindle, I know now that there are a lot more details that go into creating an ebook than is offered in Building Your Book for Kindle, but this is the best beginner's guide that I have found.  AND IT'S FREE!!!
B000I8ES5C|5.0|I've seen a lot Chinese action movies, but I've never seen anything like this. Exaggerate Kong Fu, mixed with scientific effects, just awesome. It is funny, yet serious. It is weird, yet interesting. Totally recommend it to every body, especially those who love action movies.
B004J4WKTW|5.0|Erin Morgenstern creates a wonderful, magical reality that she weaves you through.  The only problem is I really didn't want the book to end it was so much fun reading.
B000KIPT30|5.0|I have another HA 400 back home (3000 miles away) in a storage unit with the rest of my studio gear and needed something quick.  When I got this in the mail it was identical to my other one but my old one had the old &#34;behrINGer&#34; logo before they rounded the triangle.  I think owning two of these is a pretty good testimony of how needed they are in the studio.  This is a great way to split out the headphone mix from a mixer into an area where more people are and can adjust their own levels for band practice or for studio sessions.  You can either give everyone a number or slap some console tape right above the knobs or on the front... there's plenty of room.  Just another Behringer product that I will always call on!
B003MC5N28|4.0|I really enjoyed this book. Yes, I wish the ending would've been a little more clearer but I can't change that. This is a really good book and the themes and messages in our are so strong and relevant. I can't believe it took me this long to read this but better late than never!
B00AJRQLTI|5.0|Simply amazing. One of the most addicting soundtracks I have ever listened to. I love it so much! I blast it all the time!
0425252868|3.0|I liked this book because it gives tremondus insight into men on both sides as to how they thought and conducted themselves and their men.The reason I give it 3 stars is I compare it to the book The Bloody 100th,whitch is hard to beat.
B0076DCT2G|5.0|As always, Nelson DeMille has nailed it with the John Corey character.  The reader has to learn to skip over the Arabic names and words to keep a good reading flow.  Books keeps this readers attention.
B0091REZMW|5.0|fun game guys try it at times getsrven better once u levelup but if unlike I spy ulla like this game
B001EBWITA|4.0|My husband wanted this for Christmas and he loved it. Ten more words are required so here they are. Take that, tips and guidelines robot!
B0097EWK3A|4.0|great game so far! good grapic and gray effects! just wish it was all free! why do they say its free if you have to put money in it! if it was free I would give it a 5 star!
0525953728|5.0|Best navy seal book I have read so far and I have read many. Very well written and I enjoyed all of the detailed missions that the seals completed.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|Slow at the beginning, but definitely worth the read!!!!! Almost felt guilty reading it with my kids around ;) Will be buying the next one ;)  mmmh Christian grey!
B007J4T2G8|2.0|I didn't not like this book.  I was wishing it was over halfway through but I kept reading to the end and I was glad when it was over.  I am reading the second book, only because friends told me it was much better.  So far I do like the second book better.
B006VFLIYK|4.0|Great book, it will keep you on the edge of your seat.  A pager turner. I highly recommend this book.
B001UV4XWY|3.0|Far too spooky for me.  Very frightening and weird.  You must not miss any to follow the movie or you miss the plot.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I give this book five stars, just like I did the first book of this trilogy and I'm sure I'll give the last.
B00005V9IL|5.0|If you haven't seen this awesome movie, you are missing out.  It is very compelling.  It is one movie that makes me cry.  Great movie about humans.
B000HT3PPG|5.0|I ordered this because I'm a HUGE Christmas nut and am in the process of obtaining all of my old school favorite Christmas hits. My stepkids and I watched it just before Christmas and they loved it. A classic for all ages.
B005S9EJ14|5.0|Loved the theme and content.  Excellent inclusion of the parts of India that every traveler should encounter.  Theme of the movie was very close to home.  Hightly recommend for travelers and those over 50.
B000V4UFZK|5.0|No horror buff should live without this movie. Oddly with its PG rating, it's still scarier than most of the crap out there these days.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Such a good show and I am loving that I can watch the episodes here for a small fee when I miss it on tv.
B00APUYWYA|5.0|I thought it had some very funny lines and the actors were excellent.  From a jaded g-ma's point of view the story line was a bit tired and predictable but my 16 yo g-son loved it (saw it 3 times) so I watched and it was funny.
B00846REIS|5.0|I liked \\"Bared to You\\" better than the 50 Shades series. I can't wait for the next one, kinda disappointed with the way this one ended. And they couldve picked aaaany other name than Gideon :/
B00AMBLXP8|5.0|It is definitely not for young kids but teens and up (depending on your language views) it is hilarious.  I have yet to see Mr. Wahlberg do a bad movie and he can switch from drama to comedy with ease.  He is the boy in all the men we know and love. Mila Kunis also a very fine job and the character reacted in a more realistic view than we generally get in the movies.  Seth Macfarlane as Ted had all the right inflections not as easy to do when you are playing to a green screen (I am making an assumption here) as when you appear in person.  Thank you.
B009EEFTMC|5.0|I loaded this for something different and found out it's a lot of fun and can be played by almost any age level, now I have my mom playing it also. Very fun and addictive!
B001AEF6D6|1.0|the dvd had so many skips in it that i had to return it.  it did not look like a movie that i would have enjoyed, so i did not re-order that movie.  i ordered something else.
B00328R21C|4.0|Another lego product that captures the kids creativity.  It never stays built longer than a few minutes.  These are great products and easy to have shipped.  Only 4 stars because I think the price of legos is rather absurd ~ but they do entertain!
B007SGLZP8|5.0|I appreciated Grisham going back a little to his earlier works. Looking forward to more legal thrillers from Grisham. Good
B0013FSL0C|5.0|The series follows the progress of a psychotherapist in weekly sessions with five different clients  and his supervisor.  While this sounds boring it is quite addictive.<br /><br />I chose this rating because as a retired therapist I thought it gave a very authentic portrayal of both the therapist and patient's experience of therapy.  The script was outstanding as were the actors who were incredibly believable as the patients.<br /><br /> The fact that therapist is portrayed as a flawed and conflicted human being much like his patients added to the series realism.  The contrast in his behaviour as the ever wise therapist and his angry and defensive behaviour in  supervision also felt authentic.  Gabriel Byrne, as the therapist Paul, gives an outstanding performance.<br /><br />I am currently watching series 3 and have lent Series 1 and 2 to friends who are equally enthusiastic about the series as I am.
B007HACDLK|4.0|The story line was easy to read and follow. At last Flynn is showing the ongoing aging of his main character.
B000OVLBGC|5.0|I bought this movie for my boyfriend for Christmas. He is a German major and had been hinting that he didn't have many modern German movies. I saw this movie and saw that it had great reviews, and we loved watching it together! It is, from what he told me, one of the most accurate portrayals of East Germany and the life there. This was a great movie. Totally recommend.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I've read a lot of contemporary YA lately, and Colleen Hoover's Hopeless really stands out in the genre.  The depth of the characters, the way she writes emotion, and the mystery element were all so well-done.  highly recommended!
B005DOKIYG|3.0|Do not like, thought it would hold Kindle while I read<br />It is ok for what it is<br />Will do for now
B007IXWKUK|5.0|This was by far my favorite book of the series. Such a great love story and mystery too. Worth reading twice.
B006GWO5NE|4.0|I really like the Amazon Kindle Fire 5ft Micro USB Cable, Black.  It could have been 6ft, which would make my using it better.

B007IXWL2C|5.0|This was a great book.  Love the last book of the series sad for it to end, but I liked the ending
B00A77II0U|3.0|I think it was a good game, but I need something more challenging. I love the fact that it lets you zoom in 2x' s.
B00846REIS|5.0|If you loved/liked Fifty Shades you'll love the Crossfire Novels! They are all good reads. Can't wait for the 3rd book to come out.
B005HSL626|5.0|I really enjoy playing this game. I have a version like it on my smart phone and I enjoy this version much better because you can win extras and it is a lot more challenging.
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|Still waiting for the final page of the 1st Angry birds to become available so I can finish it, but this one seems just a enjoyable.

B00979JSZ8|3.0|Well having watched the series Three Christmas special otherwise titled \\"A Journey to the Highlands\\" I must report that the title says it all really.<br />SO little happens.<br />It's really more like an extended travel commercial for Scotland.<br /><br />As suggested by the title, almost the entire piece is set in that very country, .....at the \\"rellies\\" place which of course is this Scottish Baronial monster edifice straight out of Disneyland, and furnished with a fortune in paintings on every wall, ...but of course they're broke. (Rolls eyes!)<br />The Highland setting means we get an abundance of heather,stags,fishing creels, fly-rods, muddy old tweeds, Norfolk jackets and the obligatory dour and laconic ghillie overseeing a shooting party.<br />(Strangely enough, we never hear or see even one gunshot, despite a very dead stag being brought home. Might offend the sensitive? The upper class English/Scots LOVED massacre-ing things with guns, ...still do! (Has about the same appeal as schools do in America I presume by all reports...)<br /><br />So it's pretty picture after VERY pretty pictures as per usual for Downton Abbey, but don't envy them.<br /> The entire cast spent the time being absolutely eaten alive by very persistent midges, which are in plague proportions thereabouts.<br /><br />Nothing much at all really happens, ..there's a bit of a marital conflict between the rellies, resulting in their lone daughter coming to live at Downton Abbey NEXT series, ....of course to replace the dead daughter they lost in childbirth.<br /><br />(Prediction: AND YOU CAN BET YOUR LIFE she'll not only replace Lady Sybil, but she'll MARRY the recently elevated and currently mourning chauffeur too!)<br /><br />Other than that it's all scotch, picnics by the loch and dancing reels at the ghillies ball, up in \\"the big hoose\\".<br /><br /> I must confess to awaiting a tragedy the entire show, ...and it's a LONG one too, or at least it seemed so to me.<br />Somehow it's got that feeling of impending doom encapsulated within the picturesque.<br />(Or was I just pre-supposing Fellows' by now predictable writing style?)<br /><br />Anyway, Fellowes is never one to shy away from writing the bleedin' obvious, but you have to wait right until the very end for tragedy to rear its ugly head, and sure enough, ... right on cue, it does. (All very prettily done though my dears, ...nothing at all visually confronting to put you off your Earl Grey you understand, other than one tastefully presented little trickle.)<br /><br />Now of course I'm NOT going to spoil it all for you, but if you can't see what's coming a mile before it finally happens on screen then you also were probably taken by surprise at Lady Sybil's death from eclampsia.<br />The ending has already been widely reported in the media, but as said in a review above, if you wish to maintain your own naivety, DO NOT watch the special features first as it will open your eyes VERY swiftly.<br /><br /> The whole thing is certainly long and drawn out as far as any plot advancement goes, but if you're content to sit back and watch people in beautiful costumes parade around in front of beautiful interiors and scenery, you'll no doubt love it. (Hmmmm. Seems I'm always writing that exact same thing in every D.A. review now!)<br />That being so, I'm guessing we can all look forward to more of those gushing reviews here about how clever and wonderful it all is.<br />People will insist on mistaking prettiness for any substance though, ...or the Khadasians would all be on welfare long ago, eh?<br /><br />Scotland LOOKS wonderful, ....midges aside, and the castle is an incredible concoction of about six styles and periods that's worth seeing in itself.<br />Elizabeth McGovern STILL tilts her head and peers through her eyebrows, .....DO count the times she does this! That certainly hasn't changed.<br />Bates can now manage a smile, but there's a similar plotline brewing between Lady Edith and her eager publisher beau, ...who's trapped in an empty marriage to an insane wife. (Divorce was NOT allowed in such circumstances, ...will she \\"die\\" unexpectedly in somewhat suspicious circumstances?)<br /><br />As you can see, you, like me, will no doubt spend more time wondering about what will happen NEXT, rather than pondering what happens in this episode, ...which in truth is so little.<br /><br />Anyone of the gay persuasion will certainly be up in arms at the way Thomas just meekly settles for so little after he has made a most gallant \\"rescue\\" at his own personal risk that sees him suffer quite considerably, and all for another thoughtless little twink.<br /><br />Anyone of the straight persuasion will start to wonder how anyone could have been so much in love with the self-centred and very unemotional Lady Mary?<br /><br />Everyone will wonder why this instalment contains so little story, ...other than THAT one big \\"revelation\\", ..which it isn't!<br /><br />Three stars from me, .....visually entertaining, but definitely no stretch on the powers of comprehension if you like some meat in your stories.<br /><br />Why am I still watching this far into the series you might be asking?<br />Well I do enjoy the discussions here, and love it or hate it, you can't take part unless you've seen the material.<br />(Although I notice elsewhere here on Amazon that never having seen/read it doesn't prevent people giving ratings and meaningless \\"reviews\\".

B002Q9MZF6|5.0|Excellent!!!  Beautiful singing by Miss Netrebko, Mr. Villazon and the supporting cast.  Moving and dramatic, a love story that holds one's attention from beginning to end.  I highly recommend this movie to all fans of La Boheme.
0811870413|5.0|It has wonderful photos of the bread making process that other books don't come close to. Which is so valuable to me. Because when you have the dough in your hands, sometimes recipes fail to give important tips and details that can make or break the food. I enjoyed reading the story about the author and how he came to be a baker. The book inspires and completely explains the technique it presents. Then as a bonus gives recipes for how you can use the bread in creative ways. It is on my coffee table and I can't bear to put it away. It has given me a much better understanding about the bread making process.
B007OWRBJK|4.0|the development of one of my all-time favorite bands. What captures my attention most is the relationships with bands like the Stones, the Beatles, Led Zeppelin, Cream, the Yardbirds. The creative cycle is also pretty elaborately exposed, as are the roles of human frailty and abuse. I was hoping for more humor, it's definitely more toward contemplative. Over all, a great read.
1932735410|5.0|This book makes sense out of the PEMBOK guide and help explain practical application of the standards.  Easy to read!
B003JFJHVQ|5.0|Roth, as usual, gets inside the mind of the lead character and describes his obsessive relationship with a woman from an brutally honest perspective. Only Roth can take this subject matter to the edge of sexual description without making it lewd. His appreciation of women is defined by this character. He also approaches the subject of mortality, not just his own, but that of others in the story. This is a short read with a long message. If you're familiar with Roth you will like it. If you're not a fan of his, read a sample first. There is a reason he won the Pulitzer Prize and this is one example.

B00AAX68HG|5.0|This is really good for kids and even adults....... It's a puzzle type thing...... you make the monsters connect and you have to get the most stars on the ground when you connect them... if that makes any sense....... It is very fun......  Sometimes it is hard..... the only thing about it that I don't like is the advertisements...  but that's what I get for buying the free version...... it gets annoying after awhile......
B0096HIEE2|1.0|Before this movie was released ALL the girls in the office were so excited about it.  It was fun to giggle and whisper about the men in the movie and how excited we were to see them \\"in action\\"<br />After the movie, NO ONE talked about it.  WHY?  Because it was horrible.  There was absolutely no point or plot, Acting was boring and just plain bad, and I didn't even find the dancing to be interesting and sexy.  It was just bad...very, very bad.  I have really never liked Matthew McConaughey, and I'll be honest, it was because I just don't think he's all that smart. He has said and done some things that cause you to shake your head with wonder.  The girls who like him would actually get mad at me if I said anything bad about him....well, I think this movie proves me right.  There has to be some substance, something smart about him to make a sexy man really sexy.  Just shaking it and pretending to perform sex acts and talking about sex....well, this just shows that having a sexy boy doesn't make a whole sexy man, and this movie is not a sexy movie.  I'm just glad I got it from the library rather than paying anything for it.
0670022705|5.0|&#34;A History of the World in 100 Objects&#34; is an outstanding book.  The head of the British museum has a great depth of world history.and a fine sense of humor.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This is a wonderful app. I love having a calculator at a moments notice. The numbers are large and very easy use.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Wow!  All I can say is that I can't wait to read the final book!  I can't wait to see where the great characters Suzanne Collins has done such a fine job of developing end up! What an adventure!
B006ZS81GG|5.0|The lyrics are amazing, her voice is simple yet haunting, and the musical arrangments take me off to another place. Rarely do I like a whole album, and this just speaks to me.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Read through the whole series once and now I'm starting again. Just as good, if not better the second time through!
B001NHNG64|5.0|I could NOT put this book down.  Jack is a very compelling character.  This was my first Jack Reacher novel but I will read them all!!
B00AO2P3GA|5.0|Great game. Great for any fps fan or cod fan. I would recommend this game to anyone with a tablet or kindle. Not sure how it is on sp
B0093H8HXS|5.0|Finally upgraded my old Pentium 4?? home built PC to something a little more current without breaking the bank. I settled for this after looking at some reviews online for budget gaming CPUs. This fit the bill perfectly. Now, my son can play his minecraft and world of warcraft games on the PC without being bogged down by the old equipment that I had. The onboard graphics work just fine but we're still going to put a dedicated video card down the road when the funds catch up to the need.
B005COO1X6|4.0|Liked the story but not the ending. It ended too abruptly for me. I did enjoy the concept of a man-eating car.
B0015DROBO|5.0|Once you get past the first few chapters and learn the names of various characters and locations this book gets awesome really fast. Once I read the first half of this book, i was hooked and could not wait to read the other two in the series.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|THIS IS MY FAVORITE BOOK EVER!!!! TEAM PERCY!!&#60;3&#60;3 :] LEO IS HILARIOUS AND I CANT WAIT TILL THE NEXT BOOK!!
B007HC3LHS|3.0|I didn't like the fact that the chapter titles are dates until I figured out why. This book is a decent read and the plot keeps the pages turning. I figured out the plot halfway through and then it was just like a good mystery read.
B009ZXT4BY|5.0|THIS IS SUCH A GREAT GAME AND IT IS SOOOOOOOOOO COOL AND YOU SHOULD REALLY GET IT IF YOU LOVE BUILDING
B005CGI4EG|5.0|Packaging was simple, all of the discs are on a spindle inside the box.  You can't beat the price for this piece of television history.  Love the Bundys
B0073LWEXK|5.0|This was the first of this kind of game that I played on my Kindle.  Kept me entertained for quite a while so I thought it was well worth it.
B00AFCEIB0|3.0|I can't get this to flip right side up. The lock is off and it refuses to turn. if this is the way it is, the 3 stars it is.
B004H4XI5O|5.0|Foer challenges the common perceptions that we lose memory capability as we age and that the memory &#34;freaks&#34; are genetic mistakes.  Absent disease, our memories can grow and flourish until death, and we can train our mind to become super memorizers.  Amazing.  Great book!
B004QL7K6Q|5.0|This movie is not only outlandish and original but, of course with Paul Rudd and Jennifer Aniston, the movie is too hilarious. These two play their parts very well, and the rest of the &#34;hippie cult&#34; is so funny. This movie will make you laugh hard.
1451695195|5.0|Many Christians believe in the after-life, mostly.  This excellent book follows the journey of a skeptical Christian from a very real near-death experience which changes his life for the much better.  A very good book which will make one skeptical of too much scientific explanation when you need spiritual insight.
B000069AUI|5.0|Clocks. The Scientist. God Put a Smile Upon Your Face. A Rush of Blood to the Head. Politik. And all of the lesser known cuts are great too. Exceptional. This album and the 2003 live album are my current Coldplay favs. The 2003 live album, released soon after this one, has some awesome versions of these songs that I sometimes prefer.
1451695195|3.0|Can't be too enthused, unless you are a fan of flying around heaven on a butterfly's wing.  It is surely  different from any other similar story I have heard before.  Since I  never had a NDE, nor do I remember ever being in heaven, I will tread lightly with my criticism, and just say, &#34;It's not the best book nor the most convincing book I have ever read on this subject,
B001AUEMFS|5.0|I've heard Coldplay before and thought the music was okay, not great. But when I heard Viva La Vida, I felt this is a song I can put on my iPod and listen to it over and over with a few other songs from various artists, which is rare for me to say. Of all the Coldplay songs I've heard, Viva La Vida is my favorite.
141659521X|5.0|A great and timely story told by a master storyteller.  The action is non stop.  The story is timely, almost hot off of the presses.<br />If you are a fan of Vince Flynn, you know how good he is at keeping his novels tightly woven.  I recommend this for anyone who is a Flynn fan.
B003G4W49C|5.0|I read this when I was a kid and just picked it up again. It still holds the same intrigue and psychological drama that I remember as a child. Fast paced, easy to read and just the right amount of sci-fi. Orson Scott Card does an excellent job of blending the world you know, with that of the &#34;future&#34;. It is also fun to read this classic now, and see what he (unintended?) predicted of technology in the present. I recommend this book to those people that enjoy mild sci-fi and psychological intrigue (i.e. you like a book that forces you to figure out plot arc).
B000002LAC|4.0|I gave this to my friend's mother as a replacement to a copy she had on vinyl.  I figured it would be easier to play the CD.  The recipient was very pleased!
B00ADYYBFI|5.0|Heard a couple of tunes from this on a local college radio station, was drawn in<br />and had to have the CD.<br />Much more edgy than your average country radio music<br />so you probably won't hear it there.<br />Great band, great singers, great stuff, great CD.<br />Get it and crank up &#34;Telescope&#34; and you'll see what I mean.
B001EOQWFI|5.0|Great movie, but I didn't realize the Digital Copy won't work on my Android tablet.....I'll have to figure out how to convert it to an Android-friendly format.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I love how real this book was. I smiled when the characters did and cried when they did. Never before has a book touched me that way. It's definitely a must read!
B004U52VPS|5.0|This is a fun way to play with kids and adults both.  It is a good way for kids to build dexterity skills by setting up the game and they love to knock it down.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|God I love love love this book.  It is the most amazing, inspiring, and fulfilling book I think I have ever read.  I love the ending.  The good reviews aren't exaggerating.  This author is brilliant, read everything she writes.  I have and I feel like a better person.
B004I744AS|5.0|With a fun and customizable opening page, web links etc., there has been little need for my dictionary &amp; thesaurus
B008QTVNUI|4.0|Why are we okay with fictionalizing this war?<br /><br />Should we be doing this? The blurring of the lines between what is actually happening and what we think happened isn't a good thing in my opinion.
B009XEE0DW|3.0|Not much to say, must agree with G. F. Mougin. Not enough substance, too much bouncy synthesyzer sounds (can be done at home, studio not necessary), strange English title, album cover that resembling 90s bubble-gum pop artistry. A welcomed return of regular collaboration (to mend the mess from multiple-producer collaboration on Bleu Noir) but still somewhat incomplete, rushed and (maybe) lazy... I hate to say these words, but that is how I feel, being a long-time fan and still hoping for a full-creative-form comeback!
B007M45PMU|5.0|Even if 2012 was the year of people chanting &#34;Hay&#34; in the background of folk songs... this album is a treat. It stands up to repeated listens and has enough dynamic range of tones and rhythms that it never gets tiresome or boring.<br /><br />Three cheers for The Lumineers' self titled album.<br />Hay! Hay! Hay!
B004Y8075M|5.0|We read this for our 8th grade English class and really enjoyed it.  It's one of those books that although confusing at first really makes you think.  Lois Lowry paints the picture of what seems to be a perfect utopian community.  The idea of such a utopian society can be incredibly tempting, especially when people today are experiencing things like the aftermath of the senseless shooting in Newtown, CT.  The idea or promise of a society where there is order and no fear of such things ever happening again might be enough to convince people that living in such a world might be worth any sacrifice.<br />But Lois Lowry's novel forces the reader to think about whether this feeling of safety and security is worth giving up your rights to be an individual.  The community she created shows a very orderly, predictable and secure atmosphere.  A select group of Elders every aspect of people's lives, from who they marry, what job they will have down to when each child receives his/her first bicycle.as well as other such rites of passage.  This control over the lives of people in the community values sameness and ability to live without worry as they never experience pain or hardship.  And who can blame them?  Idealistically this sounds great, a world without pain and suffering where every member plays a role and contributes to their community.  Even the weather is always perfect and everyone's basic needs are taken care of, no poverty, and no starvation.  But in order to achieve this, the people must sacrifice freedom and individuality and the ability to think for themselves.  It's as if they have been brainwashed and never question authority.  Yes, it might be safer, but is that really the way you'd want to live?<br />The book's main character, 12 year old Jonas is assigned the role of the Memory Keeper.  There is only one other person that will mentor him, that in time he affectionately calls the Giver.  They alone will hold the knowledge and memories of life's experiences,the good and the bad, the beauty and ugliness as well as the love and hate that truly make us human.  By holding these memories, they spare the rest of their community from experiencing any pain and suffering.  Yet through his training by his mentor, Jonas comes to realize that true wisdom can only come through experiencing life along with all of its emotions.  It is the feelings and relationships that truly give our lives meaning.<br />Jonas is saddened and angered through the realization that the people in his life truly have no real connection to others and feel no responsibility for their actions.  This becomes most apparent when Jonas finally realizes what \\"Releasing\\" someone means.  It is in actuality killing them.  For the old, this may seem a humane way to keep them from suffering through old age after they are no longer productive, active members giving back to their society.  Yet, the cruel idea of infanticide, killing innocent babies because they are born identical twins or do not measure up to certain standards is disgusting to him.  He and his mentor devise a plan to bring the memories and real life back to their community...but things do not go as planned and as Jonas flees his community in an attempt to save an innocent child he has grown to love, we as the readers are left with so many unanswered questions?  By leaving, did he experience a better life? Maybe that is left for us to decide.
1449410243|5.0|Why are you reading this review? No one on the internet has anything more valuable to say other than The Oatmeal.<br /><br />Well, maybe Wikipedia, or Maru, the cat who likes boxes. But none of that matters because you are on the page of reviews of How To Tell If Your Cat Is Plotting To Kill You.<br /><br />I laughed a lot at this book. It's like watching someone slip on a patch of ice, over and over again with each page turn. Only, with cats.... and no ice. I can't remember if there is any tripping.... but i do remember laughing.<br /><br />This is a great book. I'm happy I bought it. I think anyone who might be interested in hilarity and cats would enjoy this book.  Seriously? Why did you read this?
B000FC2KL0|4.0|What a soul this guy is. I've seen for myself the destruction that kind of life will do, what this guy has done is nothing short of amazing.
0399160450|5.0|Very suspenseful, very well written and did not drag.  Very good , never boring.  Thank you for many hours of fine reading.
B0053O89KG|5.0|i live in a rural area & can't always find the newer seasons of my husband's favorite shows, so not only did i get it but it was a great price
B00A0SKFLG|4.0|I enjoyed the story with this one better than the original.  It seemed that there was more non-stop action and that was fun as well.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|This app has a lot of fun and different games. I would recommend it for anyone especially for going on a long trip or car ride. I don't like how you can't beat some games there needs to  be a way where you can use your points to beat games
0979019710|5.0|I am an avid reader of Personal Development books.  I understand the importance of reading everyday, meditating, visualizing and more.  But I was so sporadic in doing so.  I was undisciplined until I read this book.  This book was the missing piece of the puzzle.  Now, every morning I wake up and do my Life S.A.V.E.R.S.  It is a habit that has been easy to incorporate into my life.  I plan to recommend this book to as many people that I can.  Thanks Hal.  This book is a life saver!!
B004ZH66XO|5.0|I don't like 'endless' type games so I'm very glad this has levels. The menu is slightly pixelated and cheap looking, but the game is excellent. Cute and colorful,good sounds and nice controls. I prefer the joystick control but it's nice to have a choice. The difficulty is good, and the powerups add interest and something else to strive for. I don't see myself getting bored with it. I usually complete the level as quick as I can to get the stats, and then play it again to get as many coins as possible. Some levels are great to replay just for coins, like 2-2. It's worth $2 for a good game that let's you earn bonuses instead of a free game begging for money.
B002FGU3ZE|5.0|Fit like a clove. Excellent product. This is a true Teva! The black is very nice and deep. I bought one ten years ago and I'm retiring it for now.
B00785P2QC|5.0|Addicting and fun. Even as an adult it is fun to play and kill boredom. Download and try for yourself.
B005LAIISA|4.0|I liked it very much. We saw it in the movies and when it came out my grandkids  wanted to see it again so i went and bought it.  I recomend it .  It's a good movie for young kids too.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|I love that you have the ability to compete against others. To try and guess what their doodles are, very very fun!
B007MDB6L0|5.0|My grandaughter loves all the movies of Tinker Bell.  When she saw this new one she had to see it.  So when it came out on dvd you know i had to have it.  Even her brothers like it because of the adventures and all the troubles she always gets into.
B009NPA3Q4|5.0|This was a christmas gift for my grown daughter.  She really likes Phillips' songs.  I do too, ever since I heard Him on American Idol.  Great performer.  Down to earth.
B000F0UV0E|5.0|I am very impressed with this project and couldn't recommend it enough. These two are a majestic pairing. Get it!
B00ATSBIIG|5.0|This is a very relaxing game, yet stimulating enough to be hold my interest. The color and designs are well done. Well worth the price.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|I have had this app on both my kindles and would recommend it to anyone! It is very easy to use and lets you know when you need to charge and how long it will take.
0765325950|5.0|It's an amazing and well written ending to a series that was pivotal in my youth.<br />I'm glad Sanderson was able to pull it out of the aimless spiral it was stuck in.
B004SJ3BCI|1.0|I dont get the hype I guess, the birds are hard to control and it doesnt seem to fit my screen that well.
B007N5YIUS|5.0|I think this app is great, plenty of difficulty and at the same time it is easy enough to keep you going.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|This kept the kids entertained during Thanksgiving dinner and keeps me entertained when Im stuck somewhere boring too. Something tells me it might actually improve brain function as well...of course that's just a guess.
B00A9X9TIW|4.0|I love time travel movies and this one didn't disappoint. The movie summary and previews don't give the full story away. There's more to the plot line than just chase scenes and firing small arms at each other. Great acting cast and an engaging watch.<br /><br />Attention Sensitive Viewers: There's one scene with Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Emily Blunt in which Emily is unclothed from the waist up. Kinda a lame duck scene. Really doesn't add anything substantial to the movie and comes off as an excuse to have nudity in the movie.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|As long as you remember to plug in your device this is dependable and has a lot of great settings. Its also made so you can peraonalize the color. Neat and handy.
B0030MKGKY|5.0|Excellent movie and suspense. My version was viewed via Amazon instant video which i have to say they did a good job at compressing the video.
0525953728|5.0|It arrived in perfect condition. It was given to a friend as a gift so I cannot comment on the book itself.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This is the best book I've ever read, on to.book 3!!<br />Please read this book you will love it!! !
B008673ZAQ|5.0|This was  good series. I am really ready for book 3...can't wait to see if they stay together and work through all the baggage & issues.
B009CPJHY4|5.0|Marvelous movie, rich imagery, vibrant colors, and excellent cast.  The best of the best is in this movie.  Highly recommended to anyone who loves movies shot on location and who loves this cast of Judi Dench, Maggie Smith, and the rest of the cast.
0425263908|5.0|This was a good series. I read it after I read the Fifity Shades series and it was almost as good as that. I love that its realistic in that people have lots of baggage to deal with when going into relationships.
0761169253|5.0|Very nice book, inspirational with good tips. A easy reading book that you can consult anytime. Keep it close!<br />The writer's blog worth the access too.
B0085Z8F4A|5.0|One of my top ten favorite movies of the year and it gets better with every watch.<br /><br />The 4 disc version includes an amazing over 3 hour long documentary on the making of the flick. Just as cool as Ridley Scott's other special features, like Blade Runner, Legend, Gladiator, and so on. And its only on the 4 disc edition.<br /><br />This is the version to get.
B0083P1QUM|5.0|This Scarpetta novel is interesting and entertaining. Scarpetta displays mixed emotions and jealousy related to Benton's work situation and its effect on their marriage. Marino is the implicated murderer in The Bone Bed and Scarpetta and Lucy work to prove him innocent. There are some interesting twists in The Bone Bed's plot. Worth reading.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|more fun than i expected! my grandson who is 3-1/2 turned me on.  He is allowed to play only 10 minutes a day.  When I get home I am playing and playing any chance I get. Funny piggies.
0316228532|3.0|Kept me going, but a lil flat in spots  --- but why  did I expect H. Potter adventure?!  But still admire Rowling's talent.
B001DXS4E2|5.0|I have loved this movie since childhood in the 50's & 60's.. A great release of a timeless classic.. thanks
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|I enjoy reading this love story!<br />I recommend this book to everyone that like to read books about love. 8)
B008220D5K|3.0|\\"This is 40\\" is a candid look at the lives of Pete and Debbie, a suburban late-yuppie couple who are undergoing their \\"adultolescene\\" as they're both hitting the big 4-0. The movie exposes many of the drab day-to-day issues that couples face about finances, kids, sex and aging but the movie is missing the heartwarming undercurrent that many of Apatow's other movies are able to achieve.<br /><br />While the movie is successful in capturing a few funny and cute couplehood moments for Pete and Debbie (him farting in bed, hand holding after a romantic getaway, etc) the movie fails to portray genuine enduring warmth and affection between the two that leaves the audience wondering if they even like, let alone love each other. While most couples experience peaks and valleys in their unions, Pete and Debbie's relationship is so rife with resentments and tension that it's hard to believe that their marriage hasn't been issued a divorce decree.<br /><br />It's understandable that marital problems make good comedy but many of the film's moments made me squirm as I could feel Debbie and Pete growing distant, disillusioned and more disappointed with each other's demands. Debbie seems especially disinterested in finding common ground with Pete and hassles him about loaning money to his father (which is actually generous) and strikes up arguments about his man-retreat in the bathroom while also being ultra critical about his cupcake habit. All of these behaviors actually seem pretty innocuous and Debbie's determination to make him feel bad seems almost as if a way to drag the marriage down. Perhaps, an exit strategy?<br /><br />There are funny cameos by Jason Segel, Megan Fox and the super talented Melissa McCarthy but they're not enough to buoy this film back from a look into a sad and stale marriage.
B007TK77QE|4.0|I was a bit disappointed - after the Potter series I was expecting something equally thought provoking and slightly quirky.  This was a good read about a small parish in England.  If I hadn't been expecting more I probably would have enjoyed it.  As it is, I felt that I was reading a soap opera - it basically followed the same recipe.
B009HQ9UHC|4.0|If you like angry birds, you will love the Bad Piggies game. They have improved the game play and the overall experience.
B004XISI4A|5.0|I read the rest of the series in paperback, then I got my Kindle - loved reading it on my Kindle as the book gives the wrist too much of a work out.  I love this series and am looking forward to where it goes next.  The Kindle just made the experience even more enjoyable.
B001U3Y5XE|5.0|My granddaughter loved this game, it came just in time for her birthday, which I greatly appreciated.  So nice to be able to order this online and have it shipped to us, instead of going out and fighting the traffic. Thank you very kindly.
B0000683DH|5.0|It's a classic for any Star Trek fan. After viewing my kids ran around the house for weeks yelling Khaaaaaaaaan!!!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book was an Amazing book.  This is my 3rd book from this author.  Read Slammed and Point of Retreat and I can't say enough how pleased I am with her writing.  I absolutely loved this book.  It was so emotional.  It took a serious turn that I had no idea about.  It was very sad but worth every second I spent reading it.  I shared the stories with 3 of my coworkers and each one said they had to go out and get this book.  Not to mention that this book should definitely be turned into a movie.  Way to go Colleen, I don't know where you get your inspiration from, but its amazing how well written this story is.  I loved these characters and I'm in absolute love with Holder.  He was so sweet and amazing and the feelings he felt for Sky are so moving.  Its amazing how one persons love can begin so early and stay with them through so much up and down.  I would definitely recommend this book to anyone!  Its a must read.
B008Y5OW20|5.0|I didn't have any ELO or Jeff Lynne music.  I love this CD and will be buying more of his music.
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|This is an amazing and extremely interesting story, well written and researched. I thoroughly enjoyed reading it.A Higher Call is a must read for World War II buffs and anyone who appreciates a great true story.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|this app is way better then just goin to the website and u can actually tag people and just do the stuff u can on the computer
098555780X|5.0|Came on time and in great condition. Plenty of good knots to learn in this book! I highly recommend this to anyone who likes paracord! :D
B002MQYOFW|4.0|Good read. Enveloping. Some parts a little predictable.  Some anecdotes drag but easy to skip over. Would recommend as a book to lose yourself in for a few days.
B00884GR0W|1.0|Not that good it is hard to control and the graphics aren't very good  :( . Minecraft is way better don't waste you money on this garbage . Buy Minecraft not this.
B0094BB4TW|2.0|cannot see things as I do on my other devices and they jump around and when I select something it goes where it wants
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I like this app but some of the games are hard to beat . Still I think everyone should get this app if you want to pass the time.
B004SJ3BCI|2.0|I was able to load the app and played for several days and then it dissapeared from my Kindle and then was not able to re-download and this time amazon said it may not be compatible with my device, that message did not occur with original download and play..... so sad :-(
B0018RWMNM|5.0|My husband was so supprised. He had asked for it for Christmas but didn't think I had got it for him.
143911000X|5.0|It's awesome. I got it for my brother who loves Barney. He absolutely adored it. It's totally worth the buy
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This was by far one of the best books I have ever read.  It was so hard to put my Kindle down...I am just blown away by this story.
B001QL5MAA|4.0|Very enjoyable sci-fi read. Looking forward to the whole series. One quibble was that my kindle version had a number of typesetting errors and even some silly typo's. It was particuarly irritating to realize that the scene had changed but that there had been no tab, break, chapter change, etc.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|I liked it a lot more than the other  it was the best book ever it was great  I loved it.
B004I744AS|5.0|Use it daily; one of my favorite apps! So much good information and fun word games. You'll love it! Trust the 5-star rating!!
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|I think Jeff Kinney  made another great book and I think he should make at least one more book because they are very very good and I just absolutely absolutely love them so good job Jeff and please make another book!
B0076DELIG|5.0|Harry has again trilled us with an intriguing episode of perserverance as he tracks down a long forgotten crime. Great read from start to finish.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|I really enjoyed reading this book:) it has a good story line, and it is a good romance book. I honestly thought I would not like the book, but when I started to read it I couldn't put it down.
B0066W1AZK|5.0|So far so good, only played in &#34;one player&#34; mode, but it works well.  I like the ability to adjust difficulty as I learn the game.  As a new player, it is nice to be able to play a &#34;competitive&#34; game no matter what your skill level.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|Kept me on my toes. Gut wrenching at ties but an awesome  book with a storyline that catches your attention
B005LAJ22Q|3.0|I had higher hopes for this series because I have heard many people rave about it but I haven't been impressed so far.
B00AAX68HG|4.0|This is a fun game....took me a little bit to get the hang of it but it is truly fun. The pudding monsters are adorable and I find myself looking at the intro time and time again. The game is definitely the best!!
B00633W614|4.0|A very fast paced novel with compelling characters and surprising twists; a real page turner. Looking forward to the next Chronicle.
B009JBZH54|5.0|I bought this as a Christmas gift for my friend and he loved it! All the behind-the-scenes features had him gushing for days about how awesome the set was.
B00AJRQLTI|3.0|Like others, I am disappointed in the selection of songs. Where is \\"do you hear the people sing\\"? I don't like the singing styles of some of the main characters.  Sometimes it sounds thin and strained and they picked the actors for their star power. I gave it 3 stars because the orchestra arrangement is excellent.
0143038419|1.0|I've read a few reviews and thus I have no interest in reading the book or watching the movie. This is divorce porn that panders to women thinking they are going to do better by deserting their family and shirking their responsibilities.
B0076DELIG|5.0|As usual, Michael Connelly has written an exciting, hard to put down book!  I look forward to every novel he writes, and wish they would never end!  I love his characters.  Reading is my stress release - I just need to figure out how to read Connelly AND get work done!
B009MCRHH6|4.0|Great game to introduce to preschoolers for a sense of physics.  Fun and challenging with a clever humorous back story.
B005H29GSI|5.0|Will definitely look for more similar items and buy again. Son loves it. Paid a great price too. Thank you.
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|This is a great book.  I could hardly put it down.  As always, well writen and great foolow through.  Just a very good book.
B005V4FJC4|5.0|This is a nice Christmas song. I enjoyed listening to it many times during Christmas. I will purchase more from this artist. This is my favorite album i bought this year.
0765325950|1.0|Disgusted and disappointed all at the same time the choice was made to delay the ebook release until April. I would have been disappointed over a one day ebook delay, but not disgusted. This is far too long of a delay. I prefer the ebook format, I do not want to read it paperbound. I have been waiting 22 years for the resolution of this saga, now its been released and you are going to make me wait another 4 months?!? Shame on you. 1 star is what you get for your horrible choice. Perhaps I will find a used copy or some form of workaround to get an ebook somewhere and then you will get 0 sales from this customer because of the greed it took to make this decision.
0399160450|1.0|Once again Clancey has mailed it in.  Weak story, terrible writing, little imagination none of the details or insights that made the first four or five books he wrote so interesting.  Clearly he is living on fumes and record and every move was telegraphed a chapter in advance.<br /><br />Couldn't wait to get done so I could move on.
B008CPZNL6|2.0|This is a great concept, and it works well on other devices (iPad), but it's a little clunky on the Kindle Fire HD -- for example, the twitter integration shows only about half of each tweet. It's super inconvenient to click on each tweet to see the whole thing. Tweets are so short already -- why can't it show the whole thing?<br /><br />With a little work, this could be worth using, but it feels like a sloppy port.
B0009P66TK|4.0|Yes, this is a bold statement watch.  The contrast of the white details on black face, shiny stainless steel case, and black strap with white stitching make this a watch stand out.  It works very well as a casual piece with a dress shirt and jeans, but also as a great accessory with a suit.  The case is a true 46 mm round, but it's the thickness that really adds the weight.<br /><br />I only have two complaints.  First, on the thick casing, &#34;INVICTA&#34; is etched onto the side.  It would be classier if it was kept plain and under-stated.  My other complaint is that after a couple weeks of daily use, the leather band has started to fray/ flake, but this is very small so far.  The band is not made from a single piece of leather, but is layered  The outer black leather is soft and rubs against the buckle clasp, causing it to pill-up.  Other than that, it has been a great purchase so far.
B007712XAU|5.0|Ordered as a Christmas present ....came just in time.  Great price. My sister will be all caught up for the new season.
B00AAQVSDW|5.0|I do uncovered Florida George line a few months ago an he love them. They will be a country band that could produce many great songs of they can keep their egos in check.
075669812X|5.0|This was much better priced than regular retail or other websites. I gave this to my son for Christmas and he loved it! He's been collecting the LEGO sets and the characters and this is a great reference book for that. He also loved that it had a rare figurine in with the book!
B0091REZMW|4.0|I agree, I don't mind paying for games, but it's either spend your pay check, or stop playing, other then that the game is fun
B007J4T2G8|3.0|I read some of the reviews before purchasing and reading, and as a writer, myself, I need to stay on top of things that are selling and know what it is that people are buying.  Most of the reviews I saw were very very harsh.<br /><br />#1 It sounds to me that a lot of people are upset, simply because someone wrote with the vocabulary of an adolescent and got it published somehow.  Which can be upsetting if you are the type of person who enjoys reading something very richly diverse in the vocabulary department.<br /><br />#2 This book was obviously written for what I call &#34;fluff&#34;.  What I mean by that, is that I did not go into this thinking it was going to be very lavishly written.  I enjoyed it for what it was, and I do not hate it for what it isn't.  Fluff books, are like fluff TV.  You don't go watching things like &#34;Two and a Half Men&#34; and expect it to be of the caliber of Shakespeare, or Homer, or Dickenson.<br /><br />#3 The plot is predictable, the words she uses are very repetitive, but I found the characters enjoyable non the less.<br /><br />So on the whole, I enjoyed the read, as tedious as it might have been at times because of the repetitive wording.  So if you are about to read this book, or the series, just know that you aren't getting something complex, nor are you getting something substantial.  It's pure fluff.
B0000041Z3|4.0|I collect Sibelius symphony cycles, now over 15 sets on the shelf.<br /><br />This set is showing its age. You can clearly hear the difference to Neeme J&auml;rvi, V&auml;nsk&auml; and Berglund. The modern Nordic method. English conductors have also done well from time to time.<br /><br />However, it is a great orchestra and Symphonies 1, 2, 3, 4 and 7 are played very well with enthusiasm. The ones I did not list have some oddities, for example with the woodwind players. I will not name instruments, check it out. So it's not a perfect set but a very good one for a good price.<br /><br />This is Maazel's best Sibelius cycle.
B00AKKS278|5.0|This is a great book to motivate me to make some positive changes in my life.  I have been so caught up in the day to day hustle and bustle of raising four boys that I forget to take care of myself.  It is a quick read and will be beneficial for anyone...highly recommend this book!
B004TI5N38|2.0|Others, including REAL military folk who know/knew their business, have addressed the unbelievable accomplishments and investigative methods of super hero John Puller--a blend of Schwarzenegger, Chuck Norris & Sylvester Stallone. But after a while the sameness of all the other super hero former SEALs, Rangers and all the other tough guy military types begins to grow old. Then add in the \\"yassa boss\\" role of the town's top cop and you have a not-too-believable plot. A military guy and his family are butchered in a small West Virginia town, but so are his across the street neighbors, then other folks are knocked off. But John Puller (ex military tough guy) comes on the scene to investigate the military family's murders. OK so far. But from this point on, Puller becomes the I'm-meaner-than-anyone CID dude who knows more about EVERYTHING in the small town than the female (ah, there's the rub!) cop. Heck she was born and raised there, was a state cop and is now runs the boots-on-the-ground show for the local cops. But does she know anything? Nah, only Puller in his infinite wisdom and the usual six-foot-something-I-don't-need-sleep-because-I'm-tough can handle this mess. Note to Baldacci: I've loved your Camel Club guys, maybe you should have stuck with them instead of trying to get onto the former SEAL et al bandwagon. At least they were more believable. Bottom line: If you've read one military tough guy book/series you've read them all. They're cookie cutter characters.
B008C40218|4.0|i like it just fine. Some good songs. But I bought it for my wife, and she's not real enthused about it. But that's all right. She doesn't have real good taste to begin with. After all, she's with me, isn't she?
145162607X|5.0|I am a Gregory fan having read and enjoyed all of her books, this is another great read.<br />I love the way she writes, entwining fiction and history into trilogies that give insight from more than one perspective.<br />I would recommend this book and others in her trilogy to those interested  factual /fictional accounts of how the  English monarchy developed.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|This book is in the tradition of other sci Fi &#34;greats&#34; that holds your attention all the way through with some interesting twists and turns that keeps you wondering until the very end (and beyond?). Thank you to the author for also creating a non-sexualized female hero who is both believable and fallible.  I was intrigued enough to read the book in short order (definitely indicative of a great storyline for me) and missed some of the earlier characters in the book.  Would make a great movie - Carrie Moss for the lead character maybe?
B00AAQ7JNA|2.0|This is a difficult blu-ray to review. The main reason for buying it is obviously Rihanna's performance and there is nothing wrong with the show itself. The show is great and is everything you probably would like to see in a Rihanna performance.<br /><br />Show/performance: 5 stars<br /><br />It is the poor quality that went in to the production of this blu ray that is the problem. I cannot comprehend how Def Jam/Universal Music were able to mess this one up in the way they did. Surely they must have sufficiently qualified people to make a decent product.<br /><br />Video: it feels like an upscaled DVD version. The image is sharp, colours are a bit flat and some compression is noticable. Compared to her previous blu ray, video quality is not as good.<br /><br />Overall video quality is fair: 3 stars<br /><br />Audio quality is a different story. No HD audio content and the audio they did use is low quality, outdated, 128Kbps stereo and 240Kbps 5.1 The overall result is a very flat sound that lacks the live feeling you should get when watching a concert. This impression is further strengthened by a lack of bass tones and overall volume. It just sounds flat and empty. Vocals on the other hand are pretty clear resulting in the slower songs to be the best on the disc since they are not so much hampered by the disc's poor audio conversion.<br /><br />Overall audio quality is poor: 1 star<br /><br />So, as I said a difficult product to review.<br /><br />In the end there is only one question I asked myselves: does it give me the feeling I am watching a live performance of Rihanna on my hometheater set? Sadly no, although the performance is great the audio quality is just too poor to fully enjoy this concert.<br /><br />Overall rating: 2 stars
B003P2WJ6S|4.0|This is not only the story of a woman, of her daughter, of her family but also Ours. Yes, all of us are concerned by those events. Some will say it is the power of God, some will talk about the genial minds of the researchers, maybe it is just a mix of both. One thing is sure: no one knows what would have happened to us if HeLa was not existing....
B007J4T2G8|3.0|Really gets you hooked - a fast read! Enjoyable but not my favorite... but will probably buy the next 2 books.
B000002IP1|5.0|1989 album by the Genesis drummist and one of the most successful 80s pop rock acts is far beyond the collection of hit-charting love songs. Although he previously made three successful albums, FACE VALUE(1981), HELLO I MUST BE GOING(1982), NO JACKET REQUIRED(1985), I love this album more than his previous albums. Particularly inserting jazzy instrumental SATURDAY NIGHT and SATURDAY MORNING is really cool. Also over-8-minute opus COLOURS is outstanding. I still don't figure out how these two differently toned songs can be joined together. It is a magic indeed. If you like Buster soundtrack you will definitely love this CD for sure.<br /><br />Verdict: One to pick after listening to the compilation.<br />Rating: 98 out of 100<br />Recommended for: Wide range of pop rock fans. Particularly 80s pop rock fans.
B00A31UXLW|5.0|As always Connelly grasps your attention from the onset.<br />This is another great Bosh case with many complexities, both professional and personal. Hard to put down once started.<br />Looking forward to the next book!
B00ARAOBKS|3.0|I was interested in this at the start but it was just too raunchy.  The final surprise didn't have the proper build up to really surprise you.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|A few friends of mine all recommended this show. I quickly became addicted and watched the first two seasons within a few days!! I absolutely love it!
B0009FU0ZQ|5.0|Great movie.  All Tom's movies are well worth the money and the time to watch series over and  over and never tire of them.
B001VLXNO2|4.0|Jeffery Archer is a good author. This is not a typical book for me but i found it very interesting and related with the characters. Enjoy.
0441013597|5.0|I heard about the Dune series from a friend.  I decided to pick up the first book and give it a shot.  I made it through the first twenty pages or so and started to wonder what all the fuss was about.  It seemed wordy and very complex.  I decided to keep reading.  I am so glad that I did.  The story picks up and turns into a fast paced adventure.  Mr. Herbert came up with this idea of a distant world and brought it to life for me.  Not only did he create some great characters, but he created an entire society riddled with a vast array of cultures, politics and a shared struggle for survival.
B006TF6WAM|3.0|A great read - the story is beautifully written, original and interesting.  I found myself intrigued about all the small villages Harold walks through and loved the ending.
B008MG1E4A|3.0|It was good book but would have liked more of the technical details and maybe more of initial Seal training and what it takes to become a Seal. Understandably some of these details are not to be made public knowledge.<br /><br />thanks
0547884591|5.0|Tim's sarcastic and self deprecating humour is enjoyable reading. Even if cooking is not your thing, the book will have you laughing out loud and learning about things that you simply have to  research further.  I pre-ordered this baby as soon as I was able to do so (4 Hour Body got me hooked, went and bought 4 Hour Work Week and now I'm a Ferris junkie), waited more than a year and ALMOST cancelled. Patience paid off and I am becoming a better cook with each passing week, and I wasn't even interested in that component.  Oh Tim, how I love thee.  Buy this book...then buy them all, you WILL NOT regret it and you will become a meta learning god(dess).  Where was this when I was in school??
B005KLZWZC|3.0|Because this se is soft covered, hen you read it or take it in your bag or purse white lines appear and edventually it breaks but the book i awsome i love it. I suggest you get it in hard cover
1426209584|5.0|Tim Laman did extraordinary effort to make such beautiful photos of the most beautiful bird. Really worth every penny. Good book for student and scientists. The color reproduction is superb. Makes you feel being there, watching those birds on the top of canopy tree. Great book!
0805095535|4.0|This was my first read of Paul Auster, so I had no idea what to expect.<br />I was quickly drawn to his writing style : completely open and<br />self-revealing, poetic, and highly intelligent.<br /><br />This autobiography of his is written in the second person, which sounds<br />strange but works really well. Combined with the fact that he discusses<br />very fundamental and generic aspects of life, it serves to make you feel<br />like you are reading about yourself instead of him. And so it never<br />gets boring, the great risk of any autobiography when the details<br />of people, places and events pile up.<br /><br />The greatest gift to the reader is his unconditional frankness about<br />everything, which for many subjects gives you the feeling of<br />\\"oh, its relieveing to hear that also OTHER people do that, think that,<br />or suffer from that.\\" After finishing reading, you will view your own<br />past private life (a rather chaotic mess for most of us) in a slightly more<br />accepting and brighter light.<br /><br />I dont have much in the way of negatives to say...Auster is a bit<br />obsessed about his jewishness, in dozens of places describing events<br />related to nazism, which gets a bit tiresome. I think some readers<br />will also be a bit bored by the details of various houses and apartments that he<br />lived in. But all such minor issues don't matter compared to<br />the overall greatness of the writing.
B009GJCFL8|4.0|The performances on most of the song is great, but they could have given us more of their new music on Phoenix or Omega and maybe &#34;Daylight&#34;, &#34;Ride Easy&#34; or &#34;Lyin' To Yourself&#34; which have never gotten their due. I also dock 1/2 star for not at least making the dvd blu-ray with higher quality picture and sound. It also would have been a nice option to have been able to purchase in SACD or DVD-Audio Format.
034580404X|5.0|I received this books in excellent condition. The product was still wrapped in plastic and each book was in pristine condition. I loved the books as well. Great reading.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|I went to the movie before I read the book. Cooper did such a great job with the character, it made reading the book an awesome experience. Getting the book for my daughter for her kindle and anyone with a birthday coming up.
B008OJ291W|5.0|Love ELO and love this collection.  I forgot how much I missed this group.  You will not be disappointed.  Buy it.
B001P06GX4|5.0|We purchased this game with the intention of playing it on game night. However, it stays out all the time.
0440246008|5.0|Loved it! It was a typical Jack Reacher novel. He did it the hard way but gets the bad guy anyway. It is good seeing justice being done, even if it may be a little drastic. The Jack Reacher novels are one of the few series that my husband and I both love to read.
B002PQ7JQK|5.0|This is the third time I have owned t.o.s. first on VHS, then on DVD and the blu-ray just blows them all away. The detail in the picture makes you think that it was filmed last year not in 1966-69, and I feel that the improved special effects only improves the series. If you are a fan of Kirk, Spock, McCoy and the rest of the crew, this is the version you need to own.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I loved this book. I am going to start on book 2 right now. You should all read them. YAY!!!!
B004VMUS9G|5.0|Comes with a nice list of sounds to choose from. Not complicated. Pick your own background color too. I would recommend this app.
B005OC5CLQ|5.0|I am abscessed with Scotty's album Clear as Day. After I downloaded it I put it on my phone,I-pod and a CD. Better Than That is my ringtone. I just love listening to it. Scotty's voice is Amazing!
1439190275|4.0|I enjoyed the read and it gave more scientific test results than any other books I have seen showing the effectiveness of different diets.
098555780X|4.0|The illustrations are good but at critical places they seem to jump some and leave you trying to figure out how to get the bracelet to look like it does.  If you can get past that then you will enjoy the book.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|From the moment I started to read this book, I didn't want to put it down.  I did not see the movie so I was not aware of what to expect next.  I just had to keep reading.<br /><br />Even though this is a story of survival and a young man's strong belief in God, it is not a book about religion.  There are no scriptures to be read, there aren't any prayers to be read; it's about a young man's faith that God is good and He will take care of you.<br /><br /> I felt the author was extremely descriptive and I was traveling in the story as if I were Pi. It is an amazing story, expertly written, of a sixteen year old's survival at sea. It tells how his belief in God helped him adjust to being left alone with a Bengel Tiger. The story is definitely one of tradegy, suspense, determination and a young man's desire to understand God's love.The author shows us that Pi's faith in God gave him the ability to survive through resilience and ingenuity.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|This book is very entertaining. I highly recommend it to any helpless romantic!!! I would say it's a must read!
B009RI4FRU|5.0|Watched this movie with relatives over the holidays, enjoyed it very much and recommend it very highly to everyone who likes a great quirky film!
B0027P2ZWC|5.0|This is the first review I have ever written on Amazon, but I had to write after listening to this CD.  I downloaded it in the MP3 format, and I have listened to it on my way to work every morning for a week straight.<br />I also have the 2012 movie soundtrack and the highlights CD from the symphonic version.  The movie soundtrack is nice, especially if you want to hear the raw emotion of the characters.  However, the 10th anniversary concert is definitely the best of the 3. All of the songs from the play and movie are on it.  The other 2 are highlights only.  If you download the MP3 version to a CD, it will take 2 CD's as it is roughly 42 songs.<br />Every single performer is WONDERFUL!  The orchestra music is very moving.  I have read other reviews that say that the 10th Anniversary concert is the \\"Dream Cast\\" in terms of performances, and I whole-heartedly agree.  The performances by the singers who play Eponine, Fantine, and Jean Val Jean are so well done that in certain parts you will literally have tingles in your spine and start to cry because it is so beautiful.  What a gift to be able to sing that well.  The only performance that I liked better on the 2012 movie soundtrack is the one by the little girl who sings \\"Castle on a Cloud\\".  I liked the innocence in her voice and the way she whispers the \\"I love you very much\\" part.  However, even having said that, If you can only afford to buy one version of the soundtrack, the 10th Anniversary concert is the one.
B003YL4LYI|2.0|The author left many matters unfinished, there are just sad chapters which didn't give me any pleasure for reading the book, at the end.
B007SY3CEW|5.0|Both of my Grand kids love this ! We downloaded the free version first and they liked it so much I bought the full version here plus the Christmas one. Everyone in the family is enjoying having it. The kids compete to see who can learn a tune and play it the best . I just wish they had a version for the computer so they could practice at the same time :)
034580404X|5.0|Wonderful book to read. I love the story behind it all. Would highly recommend this book to everyone. Great buy
B00AAQRNQ8|4.0|Pros: I love this mouse and its a great mouse for gaming. Accurate, ergonomic, good for people with big hands.<br />Very customizable with DPI, acceleration, mouse point speed, etc.<br />Comprehensive and pretty easy to decipher software with the mouse.<br />The ability to save two profiles on the mouse and use it on any other computer WITH those settings is amazing. Everything is saved on the mouse so it can go anywhere.<br />ANY COLOR OF THE RAINBOW!!!!...<br />Cons: But only the light that you can alter is the Anker Logo.... :-\ Serious let down...but still pretty awesome!<br />RECOMMENDED TO ALL GAMERS! DEFINITELY A GREAT PRICE FOR A GREAT MOUSE!
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|fun, simple game. would be nice if could regulate speed to add more challenge. quick way to kill some time.
B009ZZDNT6|1.0|This app sucks so much i hate it!!!$$ u have to pay 2.00 2 do anything on it don't get the 'free' app
B00632HWOG|4.0|I find Yahoo is easy to use and dependable the majority of the time..I like yahoo and recommend them to my friends.
B007TXN4TK|5.0|Everyone in my family enjoyed this so much that I bought both the full version and the Christmas version as well. Highly recommend this to everyone. It is a lot of fun :)
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Wow what a great read. Although a heavy subject to read at times, the \\"firsts\\" that sky and holder experience brought me back to my \\"firsts\\" and the thrill of new/young love.  Loved the characters so much.
B00AMBK0X4|3.0|A bit too long, but funny parts. Not great, not bad. Enjoyable.  Helps to be a big fan of Seth MacFarlane.
B0081FO2Q4|5.0|I had a text book credit and picked up this album .... He has a wonderful voice, the audio quality was top notch, and the MP3 files easy to download.
B009GESJH2|3.0|This is a relatively forgettable CD.  My husband and I both love Kid Rock, but there's not a whole lot on this album to love.  It's just okay.
B0027MJU00|4.0|Just like her other books this book keeps you on the edge of your seat.  She has an excellent writing style and a vivid imagination.  Love her books
B00A4YVHXQ|5.0|We started out with the free version but everyone in the family liked it so much we bought both the regular full version and this one. The grand kids compete to see who can learn a tune on it the best and the fastest. I play around with it too. I highly recommend both this and the regular version. Just wish they had a version for the computer as well.
B001UV4XHY|4.0|Honestly JKR kind of lost the plot the last 3 books, and the movies did a better job of telling the stories, but if you enjoy either, you won't go wrong with this.
0756666937|5.0|Kids loved them.  They are lego superstars so both books were challenging to them and I think they will use them.
B00A9C3RB8|5.0|It was great. Every couple should see it. Makes you laugh a lot. No matter who you are , if your married you will relate.
B0034G4P4Y|5.0|I love this film and the blu ray's pristine picture brings the adventure right into the room. If you love fun action films, Tintin is for you.
B007THA4FI|1.0|It is hard to imagine that this is the same person who wrote the exciting Harry Potter series. Two words sum this book up.<br />Squalid - tedious.Having been asked to present it at our book club I had to read the entire book. Thankfully, it has now been sent to cyber trash.
B004SUWR2C|5.0|I love the game in it's card form.  This is even better on my Kindle Fire.  No confusion as to whose turn it is.
B00A3DZ61W|5.0|It's angry birds with a Star Wars twist.  Some levels play like traditional Angry Birds, others play like Angry Birds in Space.  Add in bird abilities with a Star Wars twist, and you just can't go wrong.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I have gotten stumped a couple of times.  I really like the way this game looks.  It's fun to play.
B00AHSMDQY|1.0|The movie never downloaded but I was billed for it anyway. I will be rethinking my furture rental attempts via this medium in the future.
B005LAJ17M|5.0|Watch this show now if you love suspense and spy thrillers! The story and characters are deeply reflective and enthralling.
B0061PEAUY|5.0|This was one of Kathy Reichs books  that kept me on the edge , wanting to read until it was finished.  I really enjoy her stories when they take place in my homeland of Canada.  One can relate to the geography.
B005DOL0R0|5.0|I like it because it is so compact and protects the Kindle Fire.  I slip it into my purse and I'm ready to go.
B005VT42BS|5.0|This is a very handy tool that I use constantly to keep track of my home network.  It will find every device on your network, and you can then add titles to what those devices are for future reference.  With the ability to ping the devices, as well as scan for ports and services, this is a great tool.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love this it will read to you if you dont dont fell like reading. This is going to be the best but you have ever make.. Love this book THE GOOD BOOK
0439813786|5.0|Great book!  Even if you saw the movie this is a book worth having.  The story is very good and the illustrations are wonderful.
B006DJ2JSI|5.0|I have the new Kindle Fire and love this dictionary to look up any definition for Scrabble. So easy and quick to use!
B004QX07G4|2.0|I laughed maybe twice reading this book.<br />Seriously, the book was certainly and only about &#34;kidding&#34;.<br />It wasn't bad, it just wasn't much of anything.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I wish they had more seasons. We are not ready to wait from week to week. I wish we could just buy the next season now!
B004HX4RT6|4.0|It's chess, a good program with a decent a.i.  You won't go wrong with this game if you like chess at all.
0865479410|5.0|Very readable, very thought provoking. Author has a good sense of humor, is certainly a spiritually adventurous fellow! I would readily read other works by him. Glad I purchased this, will happily pass it on or recommend it to my friends.
B008MEM24S|5.0|I love it. the challenging puzzles are more fun than the first twenty levels. like most people I passed them really fast.;-)
B004LWZWGK|5.0|Item was received in good condition and was as advertised and as expected.  There were no problems with this order and I would recommend it.
B007L6VR12|5.0|I love all of Wes Anderson's films, but this was particularly good. The characters are so endearing. The acting was wonderful. It was funny and touching and sweet. The story is great! And I loved the cinematography and music as well. If you like Wes Anderson, you'll love this.
0765325950|5.0|Lemme say that I love ebooks. I love my kindle. I would very much prefer to be reading this on the tablet I am typing the review with.<br /><br />That being said it is my choice not to wait the 3 months to read it that way because I love this series so much. The format has nothing to do with the quality of the book itself and bombing it with 1 star reviews because you cant manage to hold your horses but also dont like the hardcover is childish, arrogant, anf disrespectful to Mr. Jordan's memory, life, and work.<br /><br />Perhaps it was not the decision from Mrs. Jordan we would have preferred but she is trying to do what is right in her heart for the legacy of the man she loves. I am forced to ask those of you engaging is this behavior whether you have ever lost someone you really loved and had to make the incredibly difficult and challenging decisions that follow regarding their legacy and affairs. If you have then think about the decisions you made that perhaps did not make sense to anyone else but were so very important to you. That is every mourners right. It might not have been the choice you or I or even Sanderson would have made but it was hers to make.<br /><br />Suck it up kids...wait three months or buy the paperback...but stop your cryin.
B001UV4XIS|4.0|Honestly JKR kind of lost the plot the last 3 books, and the movies did a better job of telling the stories, but if you enjoy either, you won't go wrong with this.
B008HT4FUW|4.0|Fill in the Big Gap of the missing Season 2 for US PBS viewers!  Last year we saw Season 1 and now Season 3 is airing!  Catch EVERYTHING you missed!  Blu-Ray set is picture perfect with interesting extras!  (If it just had better track labels on the 5 disks, it'd earn all 5 stars!)  If you love Downton Abbey, get this set -- Don't miss season 2!  ****+
B009WO7NQO|1.0|you sucked rovio cant even try to make a good game iv seen better game devolepers than you. my 4<br /><br />kid made a better game than you. its called hi five remix
B007XKEY6Q|3.0|at first this game was fun but now when I open it it just says you need more space and when I try to open it after that it just turns black and then goes to the home page I tried reinstalling it but it just did the same thing please fix because I love his game!
B00APUYWYA|5.0|This was so great!! Way better than I expected. It was hilarious. The music and performing were wonderful. I liked all of the characters. The acting was good. I watched this three times in my 48 hour rental period!
B008XNZMOU|5.0|Purchased as gift for granddaughter.  She was very excited when she opened the gift to find her requested cd.  I know Taylor Swift is her favorite singer so all is well.
B006LSZECO|2.0|First, let me say Ms. Flynn is an excellent writer.  Having said that, it felt tedious to get through, as though she was putting filler in for no apparent reason.  As I got to the end it picked up an exciting, frenetic pace, and I could not put it down until I finished it.  The ending was so unsatisfying, I was angry that I had wasted my time with this book at all.  The only reason I kept reading it was because people asked me what I thought about it.  Now, I can tell them.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Thoroughly enjoyed this new book from Grisham.  As always, his writing is excellent and you can't wait to finish it.
B0076DELIG|5.0|I always count on Connelly's Harry Bosch stories to be good.  The characters are explained, there is action, without too much psychoanalsis.
B008Z9L94O|5.0|A beautiful item at a beautiful price!!! A gorgeous package received at a very fast speed. Well protected and first class!!! My daughter was very very happy for Christmas!!!
B0050R0YB8|5.0|What can I say that is not said about this set. It's huge and it's fun to build. Highly recommended!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Love love loved it!!! I enjoyed this book so much that I decided to write my very first review on Amazon. This book captivated me so much that I couldn't put it down until I finished it. Recommend!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|What can I say besides \\"Collen did it again\\"!  U wont regret this purchase but u need to buy it now while its 4 bucks cause it will go up in price just like slammed and point of retreat did after great reviews.
B007M45PMU|5.0|I had only heard their single, &#34;Ho Hey&#34; before I purchased this album and I was unsure if I would like their other songs. However, I am glad I bought it because I love every one of these songs. Their style is so different from what is usually on the radio today. It's refreshing!
0762761296|3.0|My dad has talked about this book for years, having read it in the early 50's. He thinks the story is all factual, which is probably what they said at the time. After doing a little research I found that it is only a little bit factual and that most of it is fiction.
B00992CF6W|5.0|great game doesn't lag a lot so much you can do a lot of things in it like build houses and you. Its portable you you can play minecraft any time.
B005VPRFSY|4.0|A small set, purchased for the minifigures. Price is a bit on the high side, but worth it! Get it if you need Three Pee-O and Arrtoo!
B00APUYN0I|5.0|The characters are funny and the signs are great. I rented it twice and watched over and over again. Hilarious
1451688091|5.0|This is a wonderful read. Very informative, well- written and engaging. I purchased this for my daughter who is an avid Lincoln fan.
B004MC0FO8|4.0|This is a great app to use when you hear a song on the radio you like but don't know the name of. Or when you want to know the lyrics of a song that is playing. It works great on the Kindle Fire and I use it a lot. Sad that is doesn't recognize more songs though.
B009SJ3GUK|3.0|While the acting was good, it was difficult to identify with or like any of the characters.  Some scenes seemed to be simply for shock value.  Unlike season one, it felt disjointed.  After following the Harmon's in season one, I as really looking forward to second season.  Pretty disappointing.
0765325950|1.0|I'm joining in on the outrage over Harriet's misguided decision to release this in hardcover form 4 months before the ebook is available.  Her reasons are superficial at best.  Tor and Harriet need to get together and reverse this ridiculous decision.  Its a different world today than it was when RJ was last around to release a book.  Ebooks were out there, but they were hardly the juggernaut they are today.
B005VPRG10|5.0|Although it might be a bit repetitive in its construction, you will never get bored of this! Swoosh-ability confirmed and good to go!
0446554995|5.0|Preston and Child have written another brilliant novel that will leave the reader sitting on the edge of his/her seat.  Old characters come into play focusing on how their lives intertwine.  I have read all the Preston and Child novels and this one is on par with their other great novels.  I hope you enjoy this read as much as I did!
B008BIZ06M|5.0|This album shows off a more mature band. The songs are well written, produced, and polished. There is not a track on the album that I do not like.
B0086700CM|5.0|Very fun and addicting! Took awhile to get the hang of it on the big Kindle Fire 8.9 screen but still fun.
B00APUQT7I|5.0|We liked it.  We were able to watch it with the whole family and it kept everyone entertained.  Good series.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I continually find new things to look at, learn about and just plain discover.  it's a great way to share ideas that work and other creative things. I love how you can organize your how finds
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Nicholas Sparks is my favorite author.  This book keeps your interest with lots of imagination and suspense; yet, it is an easy read.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|I was skeptical about this trilogy, but was suprised. It's more about a love story then a BDSM relationship. Think twilight for adults minus vampire plus kinky hot sex.
B009HQ9UHC|1.0|couldn't understand it and it wasn't working well on the Kindle anyway.  Unfortunately, I can only take it off the device and not the cloud so I'm stuck with it forever unless Amazon changes things so we can delete from the cloud.
B0063IH60K|2.0|I deleted this shortly after buying. It wasn't fun for me and there were not any options for changing the settings.
0061692042|1.0|I did not want this book. I already own it. I returned it unopened!!!!!!!!<br /><br />Get your orders correct because many places are in competition with you!
B00003CXAA|5.0|I have been searching for this movie and i finally got it. Thanks for making this moment aweesome. Putting all three movies to work jajaja
0765325950|1.0|Ridiculous. Blatant attempt to milk more money out of this release by getting fans to purchase both hardcover and ebook.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|A good app to keep up with the weather.  I visit the website regularly on my computer so why not have the app on my Kindle!  Works great and no bugs.
B0000029GA|5.0|It is perfect because it shows the poetic value of hip-hop.  Nothing ever sounded like it before.  The beats are grimy, but sound professional, and are in no way a copy of RZA's masterful sounds on Wu-Tang's debut.  But it is the lyrics that make the album so essential, even to this day. Nas understands poetry to a great degree.  His words blend together, and since it is such a short album, each song transitions into the next flawlessly and masterfully.  Show this to a  person who claims hip hop has ruined music, and I guarantee, they will shut their mouth.  If they don't, they are either brain-dead or deaf.  New York State of Mind itself is better than the whole discography of Jay-Z, and One Love is a perfect story, written simply but is not elementary.  He took what Rakim did, and brought it to the next level.  And who but Nas would choose the most underrated rapper to feature.  Of course I'm talking about AZ, who has sickest flow I have ever heard, and may have even out-shined Nas on Life's a Bitch.  Get it now; your hip hop library will only grow from here and you will learn to appreciate real hip hop, real wordsmiths and real stories.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|My mom is really addicted to this game! It is really fun and sometimes challenging. You can't beat free entertainment!
B0038YWPZS|5.0|Got it for my daughter for her birthday, she loved it. She used to have it years and years ago, but got lost somehow and it was her favorite altime movie. She was delighted to recieve it!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I waited until the hype subsided to read this and surprisingly I was not disappointed. I couldn't put this book down.
B0001HLVS2|4.0|The production values of this film are excellant and the script is first rate.  The overall performance of the entire cast is also excellant.  However, the viewer knows what is going to happan in this movie as soon as it starts.  The good guys(the English) are going to win.  The entire film is a trip to this end- the only mysteries being who of the not most major actors in this film are \\"killed\\" in the battles to come and how the British captain defeats a bigger, faster, and better armed French ship.  This is not to make lite of this film, it is entertaining and interesting.  Just how many times you will rewatch this film- the purchaser will have to decide.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Great book overall.  Goes right along with the series.  I am hooked!  Can't wait to finish to start the next book!
B000063UR2|5.0|If you were born in the 80's you have to love this movie.  Did you know it was Mia Sara's first movie!!??
B004WGGQPQ|5.0|I love this app! It is great when you're bored or when you just want to be a kid and color! :D
B004UJCYYW|5.0|This is one of the essential works of the universal literature, and this is the original version in Victor Hugo's language. The Kindle allows you to read it at any time and at any place you want to! I strongly recommend this book in this Kindle version.
B0010SKUYM|4.0|1) Rating: 4 out of 5 stars    2) Genre: Fantasy    3) Synopsis: Kvothe finally tells his story about how he became the great Kvothe.    4) Feelings: I know it sounds boring but it is surprisingly interesting. You would think listening to a biography about a fictional person wouldn't work but this does. It isn't necessarily action packed but it is super interesting.    5) Final recommendation: This is one of those books that I made time to read. I really enjoyed it even though it really wasn't my typical read. I highly recommend it.    Ryan James Burt  Husband, Father, and Writer  [...]
B00A3NQNUU|3.0|don't try to buy gems in this game it will charge you but not give you the gems. besides that ripoff it is fine
B0025KVLRY|5.0|I had this on vinyl the week it was released, and I had always intended to buy it on CD. What a great Christmas present!
0316098337|5.0|I read this for my book club and really enjoyed it. I definitely recommend it...especially if you are in a book club.
B00AJRQLTI|3.0|WHY WOULD YOU LEAVE THIS SONG OUT!!!! It's one of my favorites of the entire movie....besides that it's great, but seriously, why leave it out?
0439023491|5.0|THIS BOOK IS SO AMAZING!!! SUZANNE COLLINS SHOCKED ME AND LEFT ME BREATH TAKEN! Make Sure you Order Mockingjay by Suzanne Collins, the end of the Hunger Games
B009MO5G90|3.0|Was a setup for next movie and was slow and a little boring. Maybe just to excited and end up disappointed
B00A12VJZM|5.0|I had held off for years replacing my old vinyl Stones since some of their best songs are spread across a LOT of albums.  THis retrospective spans a lot of decades and a lot of the best songs - sure, some are missing, but this compilation can't be beat without spending a lot more than the price - under six bucks when I got it.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|Luv this app!!!!! Highly recommend this app for your own!<br /> A super easy app that's great for keeping track of your device s battery !bingobob28540@yahoo
B005K17RU0|5.0|Have had this app for over a year and it has worked perfectly the entire time.  Love the hourly forecast for overnight.  Highly recommend and I'm a tough critic.
B00AFCEIB0|4.0|The app is differetn than on a computer or my smartphone for that matter. NOt sure if it just how they built it or if it's te Kindle and how the OS works but it does a fine job for what it is desiged for.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|Didn't think UPSTAIRS DOWNSTAIRS could be topped, but this hits a home run w/bases loaded:-) The characters are ALL so very 'human'.
B005LAIHSQ|4.0|Really liked the movie and the new spin on Snow White. Someone that was tough and get the job done
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Don't remember how I stumbled on to this, but so glad I did.  The promise of the first short story was more than borne out by the subsequent novellas.  Great stuff.
B0085KGHOK|5.0|When you look for a concert in blue-ray you expect great sound and great image quality... this concert in blue ray offers you both... Great picture, great dts sound, and besides the entire concert, the extra material is really awesome... Is not easy to find concerts for bands like slipknot (hard rock, metal) that sounds good-... this is a good example of how this band's concerts should sound in a live record.
B007SZ0E1K|5.0|My son chose this processor to power his new ASUS P8Z77-V mother board.  He could not have made a better choice. Great product, fine packaging, fast delivery.
B002BJGYV2|5.0|Bought as a Christmas gift to a young lady is trying to get the full series of the Gilmore Girls.
B005G5PPGS|5.0|Really enjoyed this book and as is usual l y the case it's better than the movie which imo was also very good
B008MM9630|5.0|love this app. my granddaughter and I play this together. she loves planting and collecting things required to move to the next quest.
B005DOL0R0|3.0|I liked it when I bought it as it does the job but my wife actually wanted a full cover like a book so I ended up going out and getting that from a store around here.
B004J64QSI|5.0|I love the play. I can't wait to see it over and over again. It is like seeing it live
0375869026|5.0|I read this book after my 9year old asked for it for christmas. I think it a great learning book for kids. It teaches them how bullying feels. In this extreme case of a 5th grade boy with a facial deformity it shows his courage to go to school(rather then homeschooled) for the first time. I think it gives kids a great perspective and helps them not judge people by the way they look.
B002BJGYTY|5.0|Bought as a Christmas gift to a young lady who is trying to get the complete set of the show.  So will more than likely will be coming back for more if they are still in production!!!!!!!
B00000ITOY|5.0|Product came true to photo and quickly.  This is a great developmental toy for children ages 2 - 4 yrs.  Teaches math skills.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|I really like this game so far and I am not really a big gamer. I love the creepy theme and how you can walk around and look at whatever you want. Very detailed as well.
B000JO9JHW|4.0|I LOVED this series watching it the first time around. It's novel, and funny while obviously possessing a dark central theme.<br />The second time around (which was years after originally seeing it, so I forgot all except the most major of details), I found that I noticed dexters narrative rambling was very repetitive throughout every episode, and that was definitely annoying. Other than that and the police work being no where near realistic, it's not a bad show.<br /><br />Purchasing through amazon was great because i can watch on my Kindle, computer or TV on my ROKU.
B0063IH60K|4.0|its a great game its easy to learn anybody can do it I think its good its great great great great great great great
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This was a free app for Kindle Fire.  It downloaded quickly without any problem and seems to work well.  My calculator needs are pretty simple - add, subtract, calculate percentage, etc. - nothing very complicated, so don't know whether or not it would work well for more advanced math functions.  The description says that it stores all calculations so you can go back to them, but I haven't tried to do that.  Very convenient to have on my Fire.
B006JP11HQ|5.0|Compilation of lectures to college students, and that's what it sounds like. But for the little &#34;gems&#34; that you can pass on to teach, it's wonderful.  &#34;Government is necessary to preserve our freedom, it is an instrument through which we can exercise our freedom; yet by concentrating power in political hands, it is also a threat to freedom. Even though the men who wield this power initially be of good will (framers of the Const.) and even though they be not corrupted by the power they exercise, the power will both attract and form men of a different stamp.:.(2012?).... the great threat to freedom is the concentration of power,&#34;
B001ILFUDC|5.0|Got this CD collection for my son who loved Pinocchio as a child, and now he can share it with his little one.
B002G1K82Q|5.0|I absolutely love this movie and the music. I was happy that it came a lot earlier than expected. One happy customer here!
0061673730|5.0|I had never read this book, not sure why.  Good book  + good service + good price= excellence. last words
B001UGDYO2|3.0|This film was very entertaining.  Corn pone humor-like, but good-natured.<br /><br />I recommend this film to fans of the Jesse Stone books and films.  It's got a similar local sensibility and sensitivity.<br /><br />Some violence; I suppose that's endemic to Louisiana.  Good nonetheless.  Watch it, if for nothing other than Tommy Lee Jones, Mary Steenburgen, and John Goodman.
B0014D6PCO|3.0|Good movie and good quality. Unfortunately subtitles and close captions were unavailable and that made it very difficult for my husband to follow the plot.
B0064T6LV8|3.0|Good entertainment for a quiet wait at the doctors office. I would recomend this to a friend looking for a game application
B000VBIGD6|4.0|This is a humorous film to re-live during the Christmas season. It's a bit over the top<br />but still produces laughs for the whole family.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|The hunger games is one of the best books I ever read.<br />I Especially love when Katniss is in the flaming suit. I <3 KATNISS
B003TSEEDY|4.0|As for most people I saw the movie trailer before I knew about the book. It was incredibly misleading. Take all the funny parts of the book and that is what they used for the trailer.<br />When I began reading this book I was so confused by the mood and by Charlie. It was not at all what I expected. Despite that I was brought into the book. I understood Charlie and his thoughts, how he felt. He was not shy to express exactly how he felt. You could relate to him. Things you might not want to say, he said. He was a character that you no doubt fall in love with.<br />This book was amazing. I knew in the middle of reading it that it would be one I would come back to over and over again. Luckily it is on my kindle and a not a paperback because I am sure it would keep getting replaced.<br />\\"I guess we are who we are for a lot of reasons. And maybe we'll never know most of them. But even if we don't have the power to choose where we come from, we can still choose where we go from there. We can still do things. And we can try to feel ok about them.\\"<br />Charlie is a character you are going to love and remember. Take a chance and read this book. I could not put it down and read it in one day (less than that actually). Stephen Chbosky gives us an inside look into a teenager's mind and life and does it fantastically!
B001BR7CZW|5.0|But you must consider the source -- The Blues Brothers is my second favorite movie;<br />my first -- The Wizard of Oz...
B007GEMQ2I|5.0|Bought this for my 13 year old for Christmas.  This Lego set is a great alternative to him playing video games all the time.  Keeps his mind sharp and a nice challenge.
0307592731|5.0|I really enjoyed this book. It is funny, sad, exciting, and shows a great personal story from a tough girl who did what it took to get her life back on track. I have given it to several friends already. Highly recommend it if you are interested in stories of personal growth as well as a good hiking adventure.
B006OAB3ME|4.0|This is a low key, cool jazz side of McCartney, with some exceptional<br />songs and others only so-so.  I think &#34;Valentine&#34; is one of his best and<br />makes for great listening .
B008MG1E4A|5.0|This book is an absolute great book. My friend suggested that I read it and I was apprehensive about it because I don't really like books involving anything military (I hated reading the blue jackets manual in the Navy). But I did it for her and omg I am glad I did. I can't put the book down. When I'm done with it, I will read it again to make sure I didn't miss anything.
B0019N95IK|5.0|I bought the first release DVD sets with the plastic cases and have re-watched the series from Seasons 1 to 4 numerous times. It had a great concept and took some interesting turns, especially with the Season 3 Xindi arc and some of the 2 and 3 part episodes in Season 4.<br />If I didn't already own the DVDs I would buy the Blu-Ray boxsets, as the extra material in the form of commentaries and documentaries looks like it will be fantastic to watch.<br />If you don't have the DVDs then it would be well worth going for the Blu-Ray sets.
B0052RDHTM|5.0|I have read the Pillars of the Earth and its sequel The World Without End and loved them. This time is the start of the XX century till the end of WWI. Great novel and it shows you in a very friendly manner the historical facts and situation that prevailed in that period. Additionally I felt that Follet is very balanced from a historical perspective because as an English it was easy to fall for the typical cliche of depicting the Germans as the bad guys and the allies as the saviors of the univers and that wasn't like that, all participating countries had their BIG share of guilt in WWI and certainly Germany was not in the the top of guilt. This is reflected by Follet in a very friendly and easy to read manner. I do recomend it.
B003AYMZO2|3.0|I am so torn about how I feel about this show. On one hand I almost don't want to see the end of each episode out if repulsion at the violence visible and implied and the thought that people like this exist. On the other hand I am fascinated by the potential for evil in humanity. If the goal is to induce understanding and empathy for alternate view points, it does so for me. I just am not sure I want to feel that empathy.
B00A9X9TIW|2.0|Don't waist your time.  I rented this on a weekend to waist some time and after watching it, I would like that time back.
3438052199|5.0|Excellent text and apparatus. However, the print is too small for beginning and intermediate readers. The pointing is often difficult to recognize, which inhibits the normal pace of reading.
B00APUYWYA|5.0|it was a great movie to watch with my wife, we both enjoyed it very much and would definitely watch it again!
B00A0SKFLG|4.0|Totally enjoyed it!  so fresh and snappy that I forgot the original movie completely.  Colin Ferrell does a great job.  Kate and Jessica are gorgeous and Kate is really a strong actress.  Good pace to the film.  A couple of lines delivered by the ladies that belittle themselves unnecessarily.  An action film with an actual plot.
B000B5OD4I|5.0|Its a classic divers watch. Works reasonably well, it runs a little bit slow (less than 10 seconds a day) but looks great, is sturdy and after all a classic.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Everyone needs to read this trilogy. I wouldn't say it's life changing. But it makes you think about the kind of world we live in.
B00AMBLXP8|5.0|I watched this on a plane and I thought the crew was going to ask me to turn it off I was laughing so much.
B0052GACNM|4.0|While I am more of a rock and blues fan, I found this album very enjoyable.  It is amazing that Tony Bennett still has his voice after all these years.  Smooth, professional, and well done.  Since I enjoy duets, this album fit the bill.  I would recommend for any Tony Bennett fan or anybody else who enjoys duets and this style of music.
B0037LXTUW|5.0|High IQ Grandson loves these games - He really enjoys challenging his parents and friends - adding cards pleases him
B000MR1V22|3.0|mildly entertaining.  I like quirky, independent films, and actually expected this to be more quirky after all I'd heard.  Wished it had been more quirky.  Made me smile a few times, maybe laughed once or twice.  Its okay.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|great book can't wait til the movie comes out. You can just imagine yourself in the southern town doing the same activities so vivid on descriptions
B003ZSI7R2|4.0|Say these guys on TV. I like the CD. Rythmn and Blues. Hope to see them in concert soon. They  have good stage presence.
B00AE2J5HI|4.0|I am not a bit fan of Shia Labeouf, but I do like the other two supporting actors in this movie.  It was worth a rental.
B008SOS63S|4.0|I ran across Joe Bonamassa a couple of years ago and enjoy his guitar talents.  Attended one of his concerts last year and enjoyed it.  Decided to get his Beacon Theatre album and have also enjoyed it.  While every track is not my favorite, there are enough great tracks to give it four out of five stars.  I recommend it.
B006WXW098|4.0|I heard Yuja Wang in recital about a year ago and was astounded by her technique and musicality. She played four encores that night, all of which are included on this CD.    Everything on this disc, with the exception of the Albeniz Triana, is magnificently played. Unfortunately, Wang's interpretation of this finger-busting piece is mannered and she doesn't convey the Spanish spirit inherent in this music as well as Alicia de Larrocha, who offers a level of artistry that Wang cannot yet match.    And I have one non-musical quibble though, and that's with the cover photograph, which I find a bit ridiculous; if the point is to encourage sales, I doubt seriously it did that.
B002MFX0RQ|5.0|In my top 5 movies of all time!  I'm in my 40s and have loved this film since my 20s -- have watched it a dozen times, and there are very few films I will watch twice.  Great characters and character development.  The acting is so amazing the characters are beyond believable.  Fun and lighthearted.
B00004TRD8|4.0|I don't quite like this one as much as the original, but it's a good flick and I'm looking forward to 3.
B004GYY714|5.0|I am able to find so many stations using this the only problem is choosing.You have to have internet access to use it. I am from the UK, and although I love to listen to talk radio here, such as NPR, I sometimes like to listen to the radio stations from England. You have to have internet access to use it.
B00AMBH70S|2.0|I was disappointed with this Bourne movie.  I like Jeremy Renner and I though the story line was pretty good, just didn't have something the others did.
B003Y5H53S|5.0|Rango is a very cute movie, I enjoyed watching it. my little brother and sister love it. I would recommend it to anyone
B007KAJG3K|5.0|I watched this at the movie theater and it was a must own. First one was amazing and they kicked it into overdrive with both action and humor.
B004478GNI|5.0|This item lived up to its name. The kids loved putting it together and playing with it. I will buy more sets.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|I wish the next book was out I hate waiting for the next book.... it takes a look long. The show is just as good or better than the book series.
B000FC1MM8|5.0|I am new to the series.  LIke the chacters and plots.  Now I ant to read the rest of the Harry Bosch books.
B005IZLPKQ|4.0|This was a gift to someone who seemed happy to receive it......don't know if he liked it or not. He'll let me know soon.
B0042U94UQ|5.0|this has to be one of the best cartoons I have seen! It makes you happy and sad but it is overrall excellent!
B000OCXI3K|5.0|This book flows so smoothly that even the fussiest reader will enjoy it. Much better than the movie version but then again aren't they all.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|It is AWESOME!!! Totally addicting!!  Spent three hours playing and didn't even notice!!  5 STARS ALL DAY LONG!!  A must have!!
B0063IH60K|5.0|I love this app.  It works quickly and is fun. It is something that one person can do and helps alone time.
B0083P1QUM|4.0|LIked the plot of this one better than some recent Patricia Cornwell book.  Liked the interaction between the recurring characters.
B003G4W49C|4.0|Had several people tell me it was very interesting. They were correct. If you like sci-fi then you'll like this.
B008MWBY6W|4.0|This is a very nice case for my Nikon D200 DSLR.  I currently use a [[ASIN:B004SN0U50 Clik Elite SLR Chest Pack]].  I am still not decided if I will switch camera cases for everyday use, but the Amazon Basics Holster is looking better and better everytime I use it.<br /><br />It is made of nylon mesh-type material, which looks easy to clean.  The main compartment cover has a dual zipper closure.  The handle is attached to the main compartment cover.  There are three outside pockets (left and right side, and front pocket).  The front pocket has a mesh inner pocket, and a few velcroed pockets.  There is also a removable strap which you can use to sling over your shoulder.<br /><br />The main compartment has two adjustable flaps (velcro) inside.  My Nikon D200 with the 18-200mm lens fits very well.  I have the flaps in the configuration it shipped in, which will support the body of the camera while the lens go between the flaps.  This case will not accomodate the D200 with the 70-200mm lens attached (too long for the case).  Another reviewer used this case with his Nikon D300 with a battery pack, so it seems large enough to accomodate larger bodies.<br /><br />This case is meant to carry only the camera+lens with extra flash cards (SD, CF, etc).  It will not carry an external flash (like the Nikon SB700) or another lens.  For extra accessories, you will need a larger bag, such as the [[ASIN:B0078J2HS4 Case Logic DM-1000 DSLR Travel Pack]] or larger bags like the [[ASIN:B001T0HYJA Case Logic SLR Camera Backpack]] and the [[ASIN:B002VPE1WK AmazonBasics Backpack for SLR Cameras]].<br /><br />Overall, I can recommend this DSLR camera case.
B000AJIF4E|5.0|A very good item I have big ears these fit very comfortable<br />I will be purchasing another set real soon
B003O86FMW|3.0|It was okay- a little rushed. I expect expect greater things from the author. Nothing compared the first book however.
B005K17RU0|5.0|That may not be a resounding recommendation, bit it's the truth. It tells me the weather,  it's easy to use. That's all I need.
B004SJ3AXI|3.0|This game is okay, not played it much, I am sure my opinion will change the more times I play it.
B00004YRQA|5.0|Brand new condition, worth the buy, decent price. Really appreciate the labels that were included made the purchase more convenient and i got it on time.
B00APUYN0I|5.0|Ok, so this might not be the cinematic event of the year, but it's definitely got entertainment value.<br />The music is great, the characters are lovable, and there are SO many amazing one-liners (typically thanks to Rebel Wilson). It's such a feel-good movie, I have actually watched it 3 times in 2 weeks.<br /><br />I've recommended this to all my family and friends, and I'll recommend it for anyone who just wants a good laugh.
B002RV01QI|5.0|I can't tell you how mesmerizing Enya's voice is.  She has a way of allowing you to go inside yourself and be centered.
1423140605|5.0|It is entertaining and easy to read book. Fit for young adult to spend the day on the school break
B009YP9L7U|4.0|This is everything you would expect it to be. I wouldn't be surprised if they made  this into a romantic comedy movie someday. It was cute though. An easy and fun book to read.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Game is adictive, great for free moment that lasts all day.  Car trip, long rides, any travel that you don't need to be actually need to react to reality.
B0079XPUOW|1.0|I thought this sounded like it could be an interesting and different story that might be fun to read. Well, it was sure different but unfortunately neither interesting nor fun. I quite liked John Scalzi’s Old Man’s War but this one goes onto the rubbish shelf I’m afraid.<br /><br />Maybe I should have read up on some more reviews before jumping onto it. It’s clear from the book-blurb that there are references to certain famous TV-shows in it but I hoped that there were going to be some intelligent twist to it. Unfortunately what we get is some alternate reality combined with actually being in a TV-show and the dreaded time-travel nonsense on top of that. I found this book being no better than the poorly written TV-show plots that it tries to make fun of.
B009TZBEKW|3.0|Some good cuts here but overall not even in the same league as the genius \\"Ready For the Weekend\\".<br />Though released several years ago, \\"Feels So Close\\" is one of the best cuts.  As for the newer offerings, the Ellie Goulding collabo \\"I Need Your Love\\" and the Flo assist \\"Sweet Nothing\\" are the standouts that will keep you hitting replay (or track back or forward from the other underwhelming selections.)<br /><br />My take, you probably already own \\"We Found Love\\" and \\"Feels So Close; get the Flo and Ellie Goulding songs and call it a day...then go buy \\"Ready For the Weekend\\"!!
B00AMBLDEE|3.0|Writing wasn't as good as the previous installments of the Bourne series and seemed slower-paced.  I was nearly bored stiff during the final chase scene.  I still prefer not to think of Outcome and Treadstone agents as magic pill-popping mutants and instead just highly trained (both mentally and physically).
0765325950|2.0|I have been eagerly awaiting this book - if only to find out what happened. So much time has past since I first read the books that I'm no longer really invested with the characters. And I most definitely don't have the time to reread the other thirteen books.<br /><br />5 stars to Sanderson for finishing off an impossible task. 2 stars for some of the resolutions. There was no real suitable ending. It just ended. We are left without knowing what happened to a good many characters....did they live or die? For some, I'm still not sure. And for those who did die (oh yes, there are those) ... they died too quickly and were moved over too neatly to really give us the impact of their deaths. Are we supposed to care? Perhaps Sanderson was trying to hard to tie up all the plot lines that he forgot that to make his characters live and breathe and really be interesting?
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|I have read all of the Tom Clancy Jack Ryan novels and many of his non-fiction works. &#34;Threat Vector&#34; is the best novel since &#34;Without Remorse&#34;. The story line is believable, the internet aspects of the story line are &#34;mostly true&#34; and there is little need for the reader to &#34;suspend belief&#34; to enjoy the Jack Ryan Universe. The only really far-fetched part of the story is the idea that the son of a sitting US President would be wandering around inside China on a covert mission. I really enjoy the John Clark character, he has a very good and believable part in this book.
B001AQR3JY|5.0|This is an excellent movie and enjoyed by people of all ages. I rate this as a winner for everyone.
B001FOK70S|5.0|David Lynch's first movie and his best!  He's at his mind-bending and disturbing best!  This is the movie that set the precedent for the rest of his future projects!
B00AS1Q8FW|5.0|I've read some of Lee Childs work. A movie based on his writing should turn out exactly like this movie did. It was smart, fun and Jack didn't take any crap from people. My expectations were exceeded specifically because Tom Cruise managed to play the character so closely to what I read in the book. Couple that with the fact that the investigation was decent and the villains sufficiently dangerous made this a good time for anyone who likes these crime drama stories.<br /><br />The fault of this falls more with the source material than the film itself. Childs is the master of coincidence and it got pretty old in the books for me. His villains lack any real motivation beyond money and in some cases, their ability to start rolling in the dough is in question too. If I was to give this any sort of harsh criticism, it would be in the story itself. Starting the story off the way they do, for example, is pretty rushed and unnecessary. A civilian can come up with better ways to accomplish what these maniacs did. It was catalyst for the sake of getting the characters involved.<br /><br />None of that matters when it comes to the performances and the action in this movie. They allow it to be brutal and they let the character be true to himself. Cruise snaps off his lines nicely and he's got the shape to pull this off. The number 1 complaint that I hear people make about this choice was less that Cruise might not be able to do it but that he doesn't fit the character's description. Let me tell you, it might be a fun fantasy to imagine this 6'5 monster roaming the country incognito but he stands out way too much. At least with Cruise, I can believe he's able to blend in and disappear.<br /><br />Give this movie a chance. It's not rocket science, it's another crime drama but it's a good one and I think that if you don't cling to a ton of preconceived notions, you'll have a lot of fun.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|What can I say except that I absolutely loved this book!  I would definitely give it more than 5 stars if I could!  Don't hesitate to pick this one up!
B009NOVCTM|5.0|You forget just how many greats tunes the Stones have made and how influential they were in your life. Brings back great memories !
B008MG1E4A|4.0|This is written in a low key, non-heroic style, about the teamwork and training that is required to build and field a special operations unit like a SEAL team. The book is well written and very readable. Thankfully it omits any details of personal lives and keeps focus on the operational side and the critical nature of teamwork. I am sure that many details were omitted but what is revealed shows how committed and determined the SEALs are in helping to keep the USA safe.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|This is simply a great game!! very addictive and well put together, great graphics.... i play it all the time
B005LAIHR2|5.0|This movie is INCREDIBLE - It's a musical - so please know- most of the movies are songs and music- all from the 80s- which I loved.<br /><br />The actors and actresses were soo soo incredibly talented- I'm sure voice equilizer was used (which some people have criticized) but with/without that - their voices were amazing- I ended up buying the soundtrack as well.<br /><br />It's fun to see the cosumes (also from the 80s) the way LA used to look and all of the fight and picketing that went along with that times.<br /><br />The storyline/plot is also quick  moving, funny, and entertaining!<br /><br />mature audiences only- 17+<br />sexual implications<br />minimal swear/strong language
B004HW7JH4|5.0|I think this is the best season to date.  This season was very experimental and had a very different feel.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|It was the best book I have ever read!!!!! It made me cry and laugh all at the same time.
B004WGGQPQ|5.0|My grandsons love this app. Gives them room to draw as well as practice writing and make colorful pictures. And can be downloaded is needed
B0015DROBO|5.0|I read this book in 3 sittings! I had to pay attention to the characters and the family structure. Some of the scenes are a little gristly but the story line is very believable. I have seen the two versions of the movie and this book is better than both movie versions.
B006LSZECO|3.0|I really enjoyed the first three quarters of the book. It was very compelling and I couldn't put it down! But the last part of the book was just nuts. I didn't care for the main characters and it didn't ring true to life, unless they both had serious psychological issues. I just wish the last bit of the book was a good as the first!
B004EBT5CU|5.0|I purchased this CD for me and my dad, and we both love it! I should've bought it much sooner!
B005LAIHPE|4.0|Love this movie it was full of action not much story am happy to recommend it if you are a action buff
1451695195|5.0|Excellent book. Thought provoking.  I would suggest it to anyone who wonders about near death experiences and reading about someone's personal narrative.
B004XJRQUQ|1.0|I never got the book, it went into cyber space and I couldn't find it. Still waiting for my refund.
1451695195|5.0|Fascinating book, intriguing account.  Recommended for all those readers who want to know more about near death experiences.<br />Consider also reading books by Dr Ben Carson.
0785814531|5.0|What could be better than the complete works of Poe? Great book, shipped quickly. I only regret I didn't get two copies as this was a Christmas present.
B00AAX68HG|5.0|Their plan is to creative extremely addictive games and lull us into complacency.  Help me!  I can't stop playing this game.
B008XBASVY|5.0|From the Land of Stories to Struck By Lightning, Chris Colfer has proven himself to be a magnificent storyteller. Carson's journal is the perfect companion to Colfer's film. From the walls of a broken family to the halls of Clover High, this book delivers brilliant humor, along with some very heartfelt moments. Looking forward to reading more of Chris' work!
B005K0HDGE|5.0|This is a fantastic book -only one of Stephen King's that I have ever been able to read. Hard to put down !
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Kept my attention at every turn of the page.<br />Can't wait to read the other 2 books. Then I'll look forward to seeing the movie. Great job.
B009POCG0Y|4.0|Can't say I've seen Matthew in such a light before?<br />Decent story line, & colorful characters.<br />Not for kids that's for sure.
B003L77GGK|5.0|My son got me to watching Supernatural on tv. We are now collecting all the different seasons. Now we can watch them whenever we want without commercials. If you've ever watched this and enjoyed it, get them on DVD, you'll be glad you did. If you've never watched them, but enjoy stories of the supernatural, try it. One of the best things about the series is the relationship between brothers, Sam and Dean. There's been a lot of character developement for both of them and although there have been estrangements, their bond keeps getting stronger.
B000N3ST7A|5.0|My daughter and I love Stevie Nicks.  Just recently we got to see her in concert.  This CD represented many great memories for us - so naturally I bought two - one for her and one for me!
B002EEP3NO|5.0|I have some free time and this was a good way to fill it, and when its done Ill give it to my grandson.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Good story line and it kept me interested.  It wasn't just a skin fest.  Christians flawed character kept you rooting for him through the entire series.
B0087JTAKW|2.0|I love all of Mitch Albom's books with this one exception. He is taking us on a journey that is a bit too weird and drawn out. I enjoyed the two tales inside the story, but was turned away by the primary story. It was like someone you telling you the same thing over and over with a slightly different twist. It became too much of the same thing. I got it already. Have the other books in hardcover, this one will not be among them.
1416550550|5.0|Once you get involved in this author's novels,they are hard to put down. She creates an absorbing mystery combined with historical fiction and romance.<br />Her novels combine a tale of family intrigue and secrets kept over generations that keep the reader returning for more.
0486284735|5.0|This book is classic.  Beautifully written, and I love the story.  The small paperback book is very wordy and challenging to read, as all the text is small and compact, but it's worth the effort--and spared weight!
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|It's a really good game but I think things should be cheaper and breeding and hatching should not take so long
B00A3AUGEW|4.0|If you like Dave Mathews you will like this, if not you won't.  One of the best artists to come out of AI.
B009GX7IRA|5.0|We love NCIS!  Every episode is well written and leaves the viewer with a sense of anticipation for how it will end.  We are never disappointed.
B00AMBLXP8|1.0|Drugs and bad language start out this film.Nothing enteraining or funny. I could not get past the first ten minutes. I turned it off, the same way it turned me off. Hope it goes up for the Razzys. Worst movie I have ever seen,
B006LSZECO|4.0|Every twist and turn was unexpected and I loved that. I would recommend this to all those who think they can always predict what's next.
1449410243|5.0|Spot on.  I got this for my boyfriend because I brought two crazy cats into his life and now we both live in perpetual fear.  Thanks, the oatmeal!  We are more than satisfied.
B001UV4XHY|5.0|Bought this as a present for my fiance. We both loved the Harry Potter movies and it was a lot of fun watching it together.
B002KYHZLQ|5.0|And I mean that literally -- such a fantastic series with amazingly detailed and in-depth writing that'll bring you right into the world and mind of Erikson.
B00AHSIQWE|5.0|Liked the movie even though the story line was a little weak and drawn out.<br />Could have used a few more effects and a little more story
B00ADS98FC|5.0|This movie is hilarious! I love it! I can't stop watching it and it never gets old! Each time I watch I find more and more hilarious parts! Best movie I've seen in a long time!
B0054PSY2W|3.0|Overall, I'm happy with my purchase, but the Bluray gets jerky near the end of the movie.  None of my other Blurays do this.  I would really like to exchange it.<br /><br />Otherwise, delivery was prompt and it came in good shape!
B007TXN4TK|4.0|My daughter asked that I get this app.  She has a great time with it and I like it too.
B005OCFHHK|5.0|Bought this as a present for my fiance. We both loved the Harry Potter movies and it was a lot of fun watching it together.
006198969X|5.0|Great, basic style book. She gives great tips! Amazon shipped it super fast as well! I am very happy with it. Ps. I'd probably get it in hardback, if possible.
B004Z2TUGE|5.0|I was hesitant with the brief story line and cheap rental price to purchase this movie, but the story line, effects and acting was worthy of a Hollywood production. I look forward to the sequel !<br /><br />Highly recommend viewing.
B0053R3J7G|4.0|Justo lo que esperaba, el producto es 100% recomendable, para un pequeño es de lo mejor. Llego en perfectas condiciones, me lo traje a Ecuador por correo. Slds
B008IJTFYW|5.0|I love this app! My husband and I both fall asleep to it every night. There are a lot of different sounds to add in &amp; make your own.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|This game is really addictive I could play it all the time if I could. You should totally get this game.
B002PMV9FG|5.0|Bought this as a present for my fiance. We both loved the Harry Potter movies and it was a lot of fun watching it together.
B000VOC90Y|5.0|Exactly what was described, great backpack with a lot of options for different carrying methods and setups for all your gear!
B00A0SKFLG|3.0|Didn't get to watch the whole show but the story line pretty much followed the original Arnold production, effects in this version didn't look as polished
B005LAII12|5.0|My son wanted this DVD and I do not know is he saw it yet.  He requested it so I gave it to him.
B006JD48NM|5.0|Senna has reached a god-like status and myth among Formula 1 fans and this film is a good view into the man and the legend that Senna has become.
B0083P1QUM|5.0|You can ever go wrong purchasing a Cromwell novel.  She never fails to<br />Write an intriging, well written book and this is no exemption.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Great acting...likeable characters, and many times lol funny....Dame Maggie Smith can deliver a line!! You will fall in love with these characters and story line.
0345529057|5.0|Brought for Hubby for Christmas. He is enjoying them. Says they are good and follow the TV show. Got here quick. In perfect condition.
B008Y6SA36|5.0|The price was good very cheap and in HD and in HD look great thank you ,you need to get all if you are fan of this movies
B007G3H8Y0|5.0|The whole album is awesome.  I have to write 20 words and repeated words don't count. Wow the record is great, the CD is wonderful. The Band is spectacular, I like this collection of songs. IS that twenty yet?
0440238609|5.0|The Golden Compass has been made into a movie but reading the words helps you &#34;see&#34; what the director missed or had to shunt in a different direction.  The other books in the series are as interesting as the first book.  All the books of the trilogy are good reads for adults and younger readers.
B000023ZXQ|4.0|Great price, great quality on a very hard to find anywhere product anywhere in the U.S. I loved it.  Thanks again.
B007FJFDXS|2.0|This reminds me of the game Marble Madness that came out 25 years ago, except Marble Madness was more responsive and more fun.  Playing on a Galaxy SIII, so perhaps some of my issues have to deal with it being on a phone instead of a tablet, but I'm just not seeing why this is such a highly rated game.
1250006341|5.0|This was a gift for my daughter who is a 'Downton Abbey' fan.  She was thrilled so I would consider this a great purchase.
B000QRIGLC|4.0|I enjoy military fiction a la Clancy, but this book was written with enough realism to have me buying in early and I couldn't put it down.  An engaging story about some truly inspirational Americans.
B002GJT4XM|3.0|Harry Potter and the Sorcer's Stone: thought there would be more background information on the characters, not just the actors.
0765325950|5.0|I must tip my hat to Brandon Sanderson. It must have been a daunting task to try and fill the shoes of Robert Jordan, who was so beloved by his readers. But in all three of the books he he co-written, I think he's done an admirable job, and \\"A Memory of Light\\" is no exception. I DEVOURED this book. If it weren't for my pesky job and night school, it wouldn't have even taken me 3 days to read it. Naturally, the book is not perfect. Some things were not resolved to my satisfaction, some plot lines seemed to get wrapped up a bit too abruptly, and of course I was left wanting more. That's to be expected after having been a fan of the series for the last 16 years. I have been reading these books for so long I almost didn't want it to end. Overall, however I don't think I could have asked for more. The emotions were raw and although I new some characters would have to die, I was shocked at some of the victims of the Last Battle. And speaking of the Last Battle, it was EPIC. Consider this, the chapter entitled \\"The Last Battle\\" spans nearly TWO HUNDRED pages. I will need time to digest everything that happened. I can't wait for a few years to go by so I can re-read the entire series, from start to finish, all over again.<br /><br />And now a side note. To all the whiney, spoiled, entitled, mewling little brats who are giving this book a one star review JUST because the e-book version isn't available yet... GROW UP. I love my Kindle, but there is something wonderful about an actual BOOK. And aside from that, if you are unhappy with the MARKETING decision to release the ebook version later than the hardcover version, a BOOK REVIEW is not the place to voice your displeasure. A BOOK REVIEW is so people can get reader feedback on the actual content of THE BOOK. Write a letter to Tor if you don't like their decision, and give people who actually want to READ the book a chance at some accurate and honest reviews of its content.
0739366408|5.0|The depth and talent of the cast was incredible.  No audio book I've ever heard even comes close the obvious time, effort, and money that it must have to take to create this.
B000002AGN|5.0|This CD is the best music i purchased since Kind of Blue. If you are looking for something really good to listen to you won't be disappointed
