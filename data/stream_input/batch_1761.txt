B003Y5H5F6|5.0|Classicly trained actress Kate Beckinsale returns for another installment of Underworld...sounds awesome?  Yes?  Is the movie awesome? Eh..yes and no.<br /><br />This movie definitely gives Underworld fans more of what they want, action, fighting, and a continuation of the story of Selene the death dealer.  So why not a five star review?  It does't have the Len Wiseman touch.  The reason the first two movies were so well received were because of the ambiance Wiseman created in his films.  Its not to say that this movie doesn't do that..but is just different.  And in a movie series, different is not always welcome.<br /><br />Scott Speedman was also missed in this movie..I'm sure everyone wanted to learn more about Michael and his unique powers.<br /><br />All in all, should you watch this? If you saw the other movies, then yes.  If not, you can opt to skip this one.  Also the 3D features are okay, but not nearly as good as in some other movies (ie The Avengers).
1451695195|5.0|Well written, believable. Something not of this world happened.  No one recovers from this type of infection. I have recommended this book to my friends.
B002NZTZ8S|5.0|This is magical story that is enjoyable for kids and adults alike. Sure to be a classic just like It's a Wonderful Life.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|awesome!!!  it rules :) i lovr it i think its way cool:) i love everything about but to tell you the truth im not even a star wars fan XD but its a coooool app
0385535147|5.0|Another Grisham thriller. I have many John Grisham novels and he never disappoints. As soon as it arrived I closeted myself to start reading.
B0047Y0FGY|4.0|Interesting and fun to read.  Sometimes her humor is very subtle but still very enjoyable.  E-reader edition often splits words  in such a way that it is almost impossible to figure out what the word is.
B0062NAX1U|5.0|Good movie and quality and fast delivery ! Full recommend for all parents! If you didn't pay more time to accompany with your kids, no too late. Do it right now! May God bless you!
B0052RDHTM|5.0|Its amazing how Follet can intertwined the lives of everybody in a timeline of First World War, he keeps you intrigued and at the same time you learn history. Very well written.
B00913DPW2|5.0|Challenging multiple puzzles, great graphics, and a bit spooky. Challenging enough that it has a walk through. I have been playing this game for a month. Would purchase from this developer again due to great experience with this game. Look forward to playing Haunt 2!
B0092MKFIY|5.0|I got this as a little gift for a friend, and she loved it! It's much cheaper than Itunes, and the music is pretty awesome to jam out to. I have some of the singles for myself, and I listen to it on a daily basis.
0547884591|5.0|I just have to say that Timothy Ferris has done it again. His 4 hour series is monumental for me in several regards. From making money online and running my own businesses, to losing weight and getting in better physical shape, to now feeling like I can accomplish anything. The 4 Hour Chef has opened my eyes to becoming a fully robust and well rounded person. I've always excelled at things I do, because I push myself. That being said, there are just some things I have put off because someone of my class and stature doesn't do those things. I now feel like I can accomplish things that seem out of reach for a regular middle class American.<br /><br />Thank you Timothy Ferris!
B0083SBJXS|5.0|This is a must have addition to anyone's collection.  Looks great on my 110&#34; screen.  Great movie for all of the family to watch.
B008QTVNUI|5.0|Awesome show, different of course, but almost as good as<br />Breaking Bad. I would highly recommend it to anyone who<br />also watched The Wire.
B00448SE4S|4.0|Not an instant classic for everyone, but it's definitely one of my favorites. The combination of Michael Cera's awkward humor and Aubrey Plazas deadpan style performance made this movie for me. Great for when you want to watch something ridiculously over the top and funny.
B008HK3XOU|5.0|The price was right and it keeps the Kindle well protected.<br />It is quality made product and does stand hands free.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I Got this book shortly after finishing the first Hunger Games book, It was amazing. the twists kept me going and going. I stayed up until 5 a.m. to finish reading it. and as soon as I finished it I ordered the third for my Kindle. this series is amazing!<br /><br />The book follows Katnis and Peeta after the original Hunger Games book. Into what would be the first year after winning. I don't want to get Into the details and spoil it for anyone but if you liked the first one, this book is just as good (even better for me)<br /><br />I think it is better than the first because It takes a faster pace than the first book. Which was a bit slow to get into for me when I started reading it. I am currently reading the third book and will post a review about that when I am done with it.
B00092ZMDY|5.0|I would recommend this DVD to all Eagles fans. And to anyone that has heard one of their songs and enjoyed it. The music is great and the production elements are suspurb and you'll get a kick out of watching the band.
B008GXHOFW|1.0|took a long time to download and install the extra data. played it once and it was really fun now I cant get it to load. it will play the video then just exit. bummer. wont be burned again by gameloft
B0031RS2HC|5.0|Wow what a great book decided to start at book one, what a place to start. Loved the story line and found it very hard to put down just wanted to keep reading to see what happened. I am hooked now have to go through them all i guess in order to might be good. Hope you all enjoy this book as much as i did.
B004PVKFR8|5.0|Be on the lookout for AWOLNATION. They are the future of music. A rich blend of genres and styles and none of it seems self indulgent or overdone. Great album.
B005GSY23M|4.0|Martinez's instrumental tracks reflect and intensify the film during the viewing, while standing on their own as compelling melodies with strong beats.<br /><br />The retro feel of the key songs used in the film (&#34;A Real Hero,&#34; &#34;Under Your Spell&#34;) is interesting without being boring, and they're great tracks even as stand alone's. Overall, if you loved the movie you'll love the soundtrack, and if you haven't seen the film it just might make you want to.
B007B6VOG0|5.0|This album has a great variety in musical style. Songs range from upbeat to mellow vibes. Definitely recommend this to everyone!
B008GXHOFW|2.0|This worked great the first time I played it. I played for about 20 minutes then closed the app. The next time I started it it had erased my data and I had to start all over. The third time it wouldn't even load it would play the start up video then screen would go black then back to my home screen! It really sucks because what I played of it seems like it would be fun!
B008XG1X18|5.0|I've been able to find just about anything I can imagine. I've found some great recipes and have been inspired & motivated by all of the great craft ideas. Not a holiday or celebration will ever go by without checking ideas on Pinterest first :)
1439170916|5.0|Highly entertaining and immensely educational. I couldn't put it down! From the beginning of the disease in cavemen and ancient Egypt to modern day breakthroughs in treatment options, the book strikes a perfect balance between a personal narratives, historical review, scientific explanation of disease, and emotion.
B003EVFHYG|5.0|A most excellent score to a most excellent movie! Vibrant, dynamic, and stirring, it also provides the perfect motivational music to drawing - especially drawing dragons!
B009KHDT0C|4.0|This is not a comedy but not a true horror movie.  It's querky yet fun.  Great sound track too if you're a 70's fan!
B0088XXCZ6|3.0|Your earlier releases were beyond amazing.  Tidal still gets consistent play throughout the year for me.  I honestly gave this release a chance, but it just missed.  Apple's voice just does not mesh with the music like it did in Tidal.  Now it is like she is singing, earlier releases her voice was another instrument.  Fiona fans already will have purchased this.  If this is your first exposure to Fiona Apple, get Tidal... that release is pure magic.  This one is only better than most stuff that is being released now.
B002BWP49M|5.0|My daughter introduced me to Twilight and I have enjoyed each movie.  This one was particularly good because the actors have improved so much.  I have tickets purchased for part 2 and plan to buy the movie when it comes out on Blu-ray.
B007U8U1V8|4.0|Am I drunk? Am I insane?  No, it is just missing something.  I mean it is still an amazing work by itself.  The problem is that this is Jack White!  So I am not comparing this to what other artists release, I am comparing it to Jack White's body of work.  It is for this reason I can only give it four stars.  I would still say this is a must have for fans of Jack White.  I would just not want to introduce someone to his work with this release.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|I got this during it's release week for a lower price 20 dollars. Even for its MSRP, it's well worth it. If you are a fan of the movie, of the comics, of the behind-the-scenes stuff or bonus content,  even if you aren't a super fan and just a casual movie fan. You will not be disappointed with buying this set.<br /><br />Movie - i loved it 5 out of 5 for me. I might be biased but it was an awesome movie that kept me smile from beginning til end.<br /><br />Music Download - Would have been better if it was an actual cd, but you're still getting a great soundtrack with a bluray, bluray 3d, dvd and digital copy. so it's still a great value<br /><br />Bluray, Bluray 3d and DVD -  great features and extras. some are expected and some are surprises. video and audio quality is superb. of course, the dvd's quality will never be as nice as bluray but it's still pretty clear for a dvd<br /><br />I highly recommend you get this. Great value, even better if you can get it for 20 or lower
B0082JYAZ2|5.0|This is my frist Regina Spektor release.  My last ex would have never allowed the music played anywhere near her.  I discovered that it was Regina singing on a Christmas cd I had and her voice did not sound as bad as my ex said it was.  I heard of preview of this CD on NPR and went a head and got it.  I must say this is an amazing piece of work.  When I first got it I played in constantly for weeks, even after I got the last Fiona Apple release (and I have always loved Fiona's voice).  I still have not taken the plunge to buy more of her stuff, but I want to.  I only hope her earlier stuff is as good as this release.
B001KVZ6HK|3.0|The combo set came in good condition, and it has a lot for the price. However, the special features are only on the blu-ray edition and not on the DVD. I bought the set because I thought it would be fun to have the blu-ray for the future, but since I don't have a player for it, I was disappointed to find that I'm not able to watch the special features.
B006LSZECO|1.0|Horrible ending! Complete waste of time once you reach the conclusion. Can't believe it is a best seller. I would like my money back if that were possible. The story was engaging however unbelievable it is but the ending undoes the entire experience.
B008NEMPTO|2.0|Absolute mediocrity.  The idea that the vampires kept slaves for food was interesting but really, it's just a vampire hunter movie.  The guys good with an axe, I'll give him that.  No, I won't.  It's just stupid.  Two stars for good effects and being well made.
1592332803|5.0|If you want to make amazing vegan baked goods that no one will ever suspect are vegan... buy this book.  Most of the recipes require a minimal amount of &#34;unusual&#34; ingredients, and it does a good job in the beginning of the book explaining the basics of vegan baking.  Highly recommended.
B00A11AN6O|4.0|Would be nice if you could upload documents thru the app as well and specify a folder to upload to.
B007URVZJ6|5.0|I used this to guide me in the formatting and creating my first Kindle book. Excellent reference, if this was a paper book it would be dog-eared as I referred back to the information so many times. Get this and forget paying for the expensive courses.
B008G8SFGO|4.0|For a band going on 40 yrs of age, these guys can still Rock and Roll all night long and put out damn good tunes and still put on the best damn rock show in the world. This album is quality without a doubt. I'm still sinking my teeth into the new songs, but so far I am happy and a proud KISS fan.<br /><br />P.S.<br /><br />I thought KISS and Motley Crue were great last July here in Raleigh...<br /><br />MR.BILL<br />Raleigh
B001EBWING|4.0|Ingrid Bergman is beautiful and enchanting. Bogart is so charismatic and troubled. Their chemistry is undeniable and the plot intriguing. Only low quality of the sound can spoil a little a wonderful experience.
1451620829|5.0|Overall, good production and nice cover sleeve of the Catman. The book appears to be no holds barred and somewhat down and dirty. I couldn't have asked for more. All I can really say is, it was about damn time Peter finally put his book out. Fans have waited for 20 years at least... However, in the end, Peter Criss delivered the goods...<br /><br />MR.BILL<br />Raleigh
B002NZTZ8S|5.0|This is a classic movie that I bought for a holiday treat to be watched around the season with the family hoping my daughter just turned 2 will love watching it every year as a family.
B009S8PEHY|4.0|Rod Stewart has redefined himself ever since the &#34;Great American Songbook&#34; albums.  He continues to wow listeners with classic Christmas songs with his signature raspy voice. This album is ALMOST great, but could have reached that status had he added two semi-holiday songs from his previous recordings, namely, &#34;Baby, its Cold Outside&#34; and &#34;Favorite Things.&#34;  Fans would have truly appreciated the latter song, since it was only temporarily released on his limited-time, Target exclusive, version of the Album &#34;Great American Songbook, vol. 2: As Time Goes By...&#34; This Christmas album, in spite of its shortcomings, will truly be enjoyed by all, whethet you are a Rod Stewart fan or not. I listen to my copy daily with great delight.
B006ISJQ1W|4.0|First, the production values of the movie are fantastic.  Tremendous detail in the authenticity of everyday objects from 1960.  Fabric, aspirin bottles, and on up.  Very much can put you in the mind of how it was in the early 60's.  Beautiful scenery is a given with it being filmed in Puerto Rico.<br /><br />I think people forget how unstructured life was then.  Not everyone had phones even in the US, much less the island where the movie takes place.  It is a contrast of the newer businessman, who wishes to structure everything to his benefit, versus how simply unstructured most things were.  The main character, Mr. Kemp (Johnny Depp and he is fabulous) sees this.  Sees the untruth in the vision capitalists are wishing to  produce for their profit.  I mean why do you think the early part focused on bowling alleys and fat US tourists?  Who would come to a tropical island with all the ways your senses can be engaged, to stick to 'safe' bowling alleys?  Is was and is simply ridiculous.<br /><br />The girlfriend of the guy wishing to build the hotel and make money, Ms. Heard, is a vision of how young vital people simply cannot exist within it.  The scenes at the carnival are terribly important to the dichotomy of the film.  A dichotomy Mr. Kemp is forever embroiled with, stuck in, nailed to \\"hanging in the middle\\".  Circumstances prevent him from going to the left, and needs pull him (against his will) to the right.  To help the developer who believes \\"76% of blacks are controlled from Moscow\\".  How can such a wealthy influential man, with such messed up ideas be who he is?  Something is fundamentally wrong there.<br /><br />Now the movie could have been great, and it wasn't.  It loses its way somewhere, here and there.  Too many distractions of no consequence.  Too many scenes that seem as if they could be cut to no detriment.  Yet doing so would have left an hour long movie.  Still a refreshing alternative to your FX driven action fest of no point whatsoever. Humanityis still important, though messy, unstructured and in need of purpose.
B0096Y94PI|5.0|As of this writing, Michael Jackson's &#34;Bad&#34; has reached its 25th anniversary, but the sound of the album is stil fresh and exciting--the hallmark of a truly great album. The combination of Michael Jackson's performances, Quincy Jones producing, terrific music and first rate songs makes this a top album. It's a winning follow up to his 1984 &#34;Thriller&#34; album.<br /><br />I have to admit that, while he was still with us, I wasn't much of a Michael Jackson fan. However, now that the years have passed since his death, I've come to appreciate his brilliance and artistry. It's a shame that I didn't appreciate this earlier--but better late than never!
0316228532|1.0|Its no Harry Potter... I was very disappointed. Not at all what I expected after reading all 7 Harry Potter books.
B009NF54ZE|2.0|It was repetitious. In addition, to anyone in my older age bracket, it was difficult to spot some of the tiny hidden images.
0857685848|5.0|So many artists have portrayed dinosaurs in what their natural habitat must have looked like, that not having this book (for a dino-phile) would be a lost opportunity.
B007SGLZP8|3.0|I've read almost all of Grisham's books, but this one wasn't a page turner like most are.  I read along, but wasn't intrigued and I really like most of his work.  This story line was more passive than most.
0385343248|5.0|Shogun is larger than life, in every way imaginable.  It is, first and foremost, a huge book (I read it for the first time as a teenager, and it is still one of the longest books I've ever read (at 1152 pages, it is only exceeded as a single volume novel by War and Peace, Cryptonomicon and...not much else, really).  And the same thing applies to my experience reading the book at 14 and reading the book in my early 40s -- I could not put it down.  There will be some who complain about the historical veracity, but there are few who would complain about the sheer entertainment value to be found in the pages of Shogun.  The details are fascinating, the characters are compelling, and if this is not exactly the literary tour de force of a Gore Vidal or Robert Graves it is no less incredible an experience.
B008ER9QLK|5.0|Wagner wanted to cast a spell with the Ring, to create a hypnotic dream world where words, mythology, music and visuals worked together to create a magical shared experience for the audience. To achieve this he built his own theater where he went so far as to hide the orchestra under the stage in order enhance the magical spell.  Nineteenth century stage technology was certainly not capable of achieving his ideal visual production, but he made up for that with an orchestra that conjures up water, fire, love, emotion, passion and a whole visual sound world that no other artistic medium can match.<br /><br />The new Met Ring was promoted as the first production that would bring stage technology to match Wagner's music.  I therefore bought a ticket to Die Walkure with great anticipation during its premiere season.  I was deeply disappointed.  Though there were some great visuals, they were all at the expense of a creaking, groaning, crackling machine that completely broke the magical spell that Wagner was trying to cast.  Every time the set would move, you would be pulled out of your trance by this loud, straining behemoth of a machine that called attention to itself rather than the drama.  I decided then and there that I would not bother to see the rest of the cycle at the theater.<br /><br />I did purchase the Blu-Ray of the entire cycle, however, and am glad that I did.  Gone is the distracting noise of the machine.  Now you can focus on the music, drama, performances and production.  It is very, very good.  Definitely my favorite Ring on video.  In my opinion, the experience of watching this video with a good HDTV and sound system far surpasses the experience in the theater and, at about one tenth of the cost of a Ring Cycle ticket, is an absolute bargain.
B008Y5OW20|4.0|From the first ELO album to Long Wave Jeff Lynne has always been a touchstone for me. I lost the Beatles, and through the years he seemed, to me, to understand what made them speak to me. Beautiful melodies, great production, and sometimes lyrics I could make sense out of.. Long Wave, for me is very personal. It brought to mind a song that I loved so many years ago, and presented it in a mode that was very accessable to me..so much so I'm going to sing it at my wedding. So, should you buy this album? If you know the songs, yes....if you don't but have bonded with Mr Lynne through ELO, and all the other projects he had been envolved with..perhaps....Armchair ,..is coming for re-release, this you MUST have.
B005K17RU0|5.0|I have a chance to check the weather where family members live. Really neat!<br /><br />Also, checking the wind speed and humidity levels here in Alaska.
B008MG1E4A|3.0|I really enjoyed reading this book about Navy Seals for whom I have great respect.  The book is very entertaining and was a fast read as I was eager to learn all I could about the mission to get Osama Bin Laden.  I'm not sure what I expected or what more could have been written about mission, but it came across more as less as just another of many missions- and I guess to them, it was!  Perhaps 3 stars is a little low. I would recommend the book to anyone who would like to know something about how one becomes a Seal, the type of training and missions they do, and something of their psychological makeup (or at least one).  I think most of the details of the raid, however, you may have already seen on TV specials.
0316228532|4.0|First off let me say that not too many people take their time to write about and get to understand how the less than perfect side of society think, feel, function and live.  This book is hard to get into.  The first hundred pages are bogged down with many characters and happenings that intertwine and make the story great in the end.  I found it difficult to put the book down after that though.  I thought Ms. Rowling did an excellent job portraying the many characters in her story.  The ending of this book is stomachable if you've read it before you begin, then you know what's coming.  You certainly feel invested in the town by the end, I'm just not sure Rowling wrapped the characters' individual stories as well as she could have.  I think she served what she thought as justice to their shortcomings and left it at that. I would have liked her to finish it better all around.
1442444053|5.0|Any effort to describe Watership Down will inevitably sound either ridiculous (rabbit with gift of prophecy leaves the warren to...wait, what?) or pretentious.  But Watership Down is neither -- it is a wondrous, deep, exceptionally written book about rabbit society that could have just as easily been written about people, and in a certain sense is exactly that.  No less sweeping than Dune except, you know, with rabbits, this is a book that is surprisingly intense, remarkably insightful and brilliantly clever.  Even if you have not a whit's interest in fantasy, warfare, societal analysis or, um, rabbits, you should read this book.  It will surprise you, engross you and (most importantly) entertain you.
B002HJ9PTO|5.0|Used this for a quick little project. Plugged right in to the camcorder with no problems or setup. Sounded great with no hiss or popping. Well worth the money.
0143121006|4.0|Midnight in Peking presents a murder investigation sidelined by international politics. You can read synopses of the story elsewhere; my view comes from one with a interest in Chinese history and as a traveler to some of the older areas in Beijing as well as rural China. I found this book fascinating....the British 'best face forward', the American brashness, the role of the ruthless Japanese, the poor Chinese peasants coming into the city, the White Russians. An interesting historical perspective while also presenting the details (and solution) to an unsolved murder. Only four stars for lack of a good map; the historical one on the end pages does not suffice.
B0098VYCCE|4.0|We liked this movie a lot.  Would have given it 4.5 stars if I could have.  Not the very best movie I've ever seen, but I liked how they played off the original snow white story.  Worth watching.
B008FSCNTK|2.0|Diana Krall is a star, so why did she feel the need to pose for such sleezy photos?  She doesn't need to use sex to sell her music.  In her concert DVDs she downplays her looks and focuses on being a serious musician.  So what's with the cover?  As for the musical content, I can't blame her for wanting to try a new style, though I prefer her old sound.  It's not simply that she's put the piano away, but that she's primarily here as a vocalist.  That's OK; her fame allows her to experiment musically...but what was she thinking about the photos?
0061998494|5.0|Just wanted to throw in my support of this book.  I've been a fan of the LLS since he started, and decided to read his autobiography.  As on his show, he pulls no punches.  He knows that he's not like everybody else, and instead of emulating he learns from the best then makes it his own.  If I ever got lucky enough to get interviewed, I would want it to be Craig Ferguson.
B007712XAU|5.0|My wife bought this series. I had little interest in watching the show until she put the first episode in the player. I put my book down and watched the first five minutes with her. At that point, I was hooked. The acting and casting are both superb. This is a must see show with a great story line, and viewing if from the beginning is definitely the way to go.
B00493E1GI|5.0|great movie, Julia Roberts always such a great actress.<br />Beautiful scenary,i would definately watch this movie again and recommend it!
B001KR9AP8|5.0|This is one of Beyonce's best albums.  It has a nice mixture of songs and is very engaging for the listener.
0756404738|5.0|This book follows on The name of the Wind. It delves deeper into the world of this series, explains some of the disparate groups and factions that inhabit it, and pushes the main character further and faster through his experiences than the first book. There is a bit of a trade off in that, many people may not like the combination of pace and plot progression, but if you are willing to take the ride the author is offering it is a heck of an experience.<br /><br />A lot of the book revolves around what seems to be setting up for later story and plot rather than exploiting it now, which may be a bit of a let down for some, but I personally love the circumspect way the protagonist and his nemeses meet and trade glancing blows, as he slowly wends his way from ignorance to expertise on who they are and what he can do about it. Alluding to secret societies and holy warriors, a dreadful evil roams antagonizing him all the while fearful of the powers that he may one day come to realize.<br /><br />I eagerly anticipate further installments and I believe you will too if you give this series the chance it deserves.
B005OSUKSA|3.0|Not what I expected. A little disappointed.  A gifted artist but the repertory was not what I thought it would be.  Selections on the album not cohesive.
B008G8SFGO|5.0|Another stellar contribution to an already brilliant catalogue! This stands up against all that came before and points nicely towards what may still come,
B000OZ0NXA|1.0|new movie with tom crues stinks.  cruse should never have been selected for reacher.  breacher is a huge strong prson  not a shrimp
B000N2HBSO|5.0|Loved this book.  GET IT - READ IT! It is among the best I have ever read and really provides insights into this man's balance, political intellect and...true LEADERSHIP!
B008Z9YLV2|4.0|I'm not a movie critic, so I'll save that for the experts.  I enjoyed the movie and thought it was very well acted and stitched together.  I felt the character development was well done.<br /><br />Online - as an Amazon Prime customer with 2 Kindle accounts, I find it a bit annoying that I can't watch an HD movie on my HD-compatible netbook.  Let's go Amazon - don't force me to buy a Fire.  I don't need a tablet.  Let me watch HD movies on my netbook!
075640407X|5.0|The name of the Wind is one of the best books I have ever read, hands down, bar none. I enjoyed it enough I bought it in Hardcover just so I would have a quality copy for years to come and many MANY rereads into the future.<br /><br />Great story telling, great well thought and fleshed out characters, an immersive and detailed world, a backstory and plot line that draws you forward through the book. You want to keep reading just to know what the next turn will bring or the next character interaction will reveal. It walks that fine line where the main character is so relate-able you wind up being appalled and confused when what he chooses isn't what you would have chosen, yet a discrete and well enough resolved character that you can pull for him to break away from the story and just experience the events around him.<br /><br />I won't get into the story itself, too much there. But this book is worth a read for anyone who loves a good book, enjoys fantasy, or heck even Sci-Fi. If you've read the likes of Tolkien, C.S. Lewis, Roberts, or Goodkind, or anyone who enjoys a good story told like the good old days of Crichton, W.E.B. Griffon, Orson Scott Card, and Clancy this book will be a purchase on your shelf. Patrick Rothfuss is a name to remember for the future. He will be telling stories worth listening to for years to come.

B009FZHYKU|4.0|Zombie fans, this is the show you have been waiting for. The makeup, the effects, the nastiness, all first rate stuff! Never seen a better looking zombie ever. On the other hand, you will cringe at the stupid plot points and writing. This is a good show, just sad that it couldn't be better. The show is missing Frank Darabont but it's still fun.<br /><br />R.I.P. T-Dogg
B008ER9QKG|5.0|The great German composer Richard Wagner took various Teutonic and Icelandic legends and composed the books, libretti and the music for four towering musical dramas, which he called The Ring of the Nibelungen Cycle. I do not doubt that Wagner heard in his superb musical mind, what the various orchestral and vocal notes, which he wrote, were to sounds like. I am also sure that he could visualize how all this would look on stage. Wagner had a concept in his mind throughout this long process spread over many years, which took to bring forth the Ring cycle. Wagner's score, which contained all the musical, orchestral and vocal parts, however, made no sound. It took over the years of many excellent conductors, instrumentalists and singers to bring Wagner's musical blueprints to life. Each of these musicians also had a concept of what the notes and roles encompassed about. Some performers were obviously much more successful than others in realizing the demands which Wagner had provided.<br />Many singers over the years have essayed the parts which make up the Ring cycle. There have been many notable performances and unfortunately also a few forget the old ones as well. The latest Metropolitan series involves two notable maestros (James Levine and Fabio Luisi), the wonderful Metropolitan Opera Orchestra, and some of the finest singers in the world today. Levine and Luisi each bring their individual concepts to the score but both re-create the Wagner scores very well. While the onstage vocal performers in this series are going to be compared to some of the outstanding performance concepts of the past, often which of the various performers which we prefer to listen to is dependent on our individual concepts of how to perform and execute each role. All of the singers in the new Met Ring cycle are first rate, and even at the top of this genre in the world today. This is often one of the most lyrically sung Ring Cycles which I have ever heard. Deborah Voigt, Bryn Terfel, Jay Hunter Morris, Jonas Kaufmann, Stephanie Blythe, Eva-Marie Westbroek, Gerhard Siegel, Eric Owens and  Hans-Peter Koenig as well as others in the cast are simply fantastic.<br />The stage image which Wagner envisioned was certainly not possible to achieve during his lifetime. I don't believe he ever saw his concept realized fully during his lifetime. The actual &#34;staging&#34; of an opera production is often far more controversial than singer A or B, or conductor A or B. One. Either accepts and appreciates the director’s concept or does not. Such acceptance or rejection is usually either very strongly for or very strongly against. No production gathers 100% approval or 100% rejection. This is undoubtedly going to be true for Robert Lepage's production as well. I personally find this to be one of the finest and most exciting productions of the Ring Cycle which I have been privileged to see. The &#34;machine&#34; allows a more or less uni-set concept which I feel works very well. The theatrical effects such as achieved in the various lighting, costumes and other creations inherent in the ring, make this a thrilling, modern, but still holding to the traditions of Wagner Ring cycle. I would heartily recommend this eight DVD set to any who would like to experience the Ring cycle in a production which may prove to be the most &#34;state of the art&#34; production available at this time. I cannot imagine the effects the machine provides being overshadowed currently by any means but cinema graphic.<br />By Dr. Joseph Perry
1416955070|1.0|This book is like the inner workings of a preteen who is obsessed with paranormal romance and just failed her creative writing class. It's probably the most unoriginal thing I've ever read. In the author's fanfiction, she worships Draco Malfoy. She apparently loves him so much that she decided to cast him as her main typical \\"badboy\\" who the \\"heroine\\" falls in love with. He's so predictable it made me wish it were real so I could ask him to kill me with his \\"stele\\" to put me out of my misery. Clary (what kind of name is that?) is your typical girl with a male best friend who she has sealed into the friend zone indefinitely, named Simon. Simon just gets in the way. He's basically Ron Weasley but less interesting. Of course, everyone loves Clary even though she's a useless bitch. You can tell that the author wanted to make her \\"fiery\\" and \\"sassy\\" but it fell short. She comes off as just a cruel person who makes no effort to help or even contribute the conflict. She might as well be a wet blanket that slaps people randomly. The descriptions of the characters are just pathetic. She goes on and on about how Clary was average looking and then goes into a whole mess above the vibrancy of her beautiful red hair and how everyone thinks she's gorgeous. During any fight scenes, Clary just sits and plays damsel in distress. This is a fanfiction gone awry. It had the makings to be a good book, but this is just silly. I found myself laughing aloud as I read it. It was like reading the \\"My Immortal\\" fanfiction except even more poorly written. Don't waste your time on this book. This is the only time I think I've ever hoped that the movie is better than the book.

B005JR47R6|3.0|I know I am in the minority but I felt the last show was a lot like the last &#34;Rescue Me&#34; episode, it destroyed all the greatness that had come before it. I was prepeared for something great and instead I was given middle of the road. Only wish they could have taken more time and thought it through before ending it that way. Could have gone out great instead of limping out.

B009CG2YDE|4.0|the game is pretty simple enough and straightforward. You have to move your phone left or right to move the spider and the shooting automatic.I would have given it a perfect 5 if there was an option for touch controls, but in no way is that a deal breaker. Really really good buy at regular price even better for free though.

B00144VBBS|5.0|If you like Toby Keith, you'll love the 2 CD collection of his hits. I don't use iTunes - but even when I download some songs from the Internet, I still buy CDs from time to time. This is a good one. If you're not familiar with the artist's music, you're probably living under a rock. But you'll like it anyhow, if you like country music. It's a good colleciton.
1401941893|5.0|I got this book as a christmas gift in 2011.  I loved every bit of this book. Its cover is pink and has pictures of flowers and butterflies.  In the beginning of the book, there is a story of a girl who wanted to help a butterfly to come out of its cocoon. Soon she realised the cocoon was intended to create the struggle necessary for the butterfly to fly.  When I read the story, it reminded me of another saying 'If an egg cracks itself from inside it becomes a chicken, but if you crack an egg from outside it becomes a fried egg'.  Every challenge, every obstacle makes us strong. Struggles are part of our life, they are neccessary to be strong.    Miranda is a big believer that everything happens in life for a reason.  I believe that whether you want it to happen or not, things happen for a reason. Just like Alan Cohen's saying,\\"Everyone and everything that shows up in our life is a reflection of something that is happening inside of us.\\"  Sometimes, we learn from experiences and discover our true belief.    She stresses the importance of loving oneself. It's the main point of the book. \\"What you see in yourself is what you see in others. In order to love others fully you need to first love and accpet your self\\".  That's why we need to respect ourselves too. We don't need to wish to become what we are not because individuals have unique personalities. For that reason, I am grateful for what I have been given and I appreciate who I am.    \\"Be yourself, everyone else is taken\\" - Oscar Wilde    She believes we all have potential talents and strenghts within us. Anyone can achieve their goals in life.    One of her favourite sayings is \\"the only thing limiting you is your thoughts.\\"  Miranda encourages you to take action of your infinite imagination.    She wrote this book to empower women to reach their dreams and to share her inspirations. Indeed, it did this for me. This book made me feel like I'm capable of anything.  She included positive affirmations at the end ofthe book. Louise L. Hay, the author of 'you can heal your life', is one of her inspirations. I liked Louise Hay's affirmation \\"Every thought I think is creating my life\\". I was inspired by Louise's affirmations and decided to read Louise Hay's book. I also went to see her in Melbourn, Australia in August, 2012. I really enjoyed the conference ' You can do it'.    I also bought two more copies of Miranda Kerr's book and gave them to my friends and I strongly recommend it to all women.    [...]
B005HSG3TC|4.0|I love this thing! No complaints. It's light weight, it does it's job well. I didn't realize the front cover was the bendable stand, but the strap keeps it closed and the stand protects the front of it.<br />Only reason why it's not 5 stars?? It's not a 360 case and it doesn't come in purple (or other colors besides pink, gray, and black). But if those aren't issues for you, it's truly a great buy especially for the price (went down since the Kindle Fire HDs came out).<br />It holds the fire in without a problem, can access all the buttons and cords easily and it show's the skein I bought for my kindle (I didn't want a case that would hide the skein on the front...I loved the design but a case that covered it all would also defeat the purpose of the skein entirely...)

B007SGLZP8|3.0|My lovely wife thought it was great, she loved it, but what I got out of it was something less than pure joy.  I've read around ten of the growing list of books by Grisham, and some titles I really enjoyed.  this one just didn't hold my interest as much as some others.  I vaguely figured the plot very early on, without great detail (which would be implausible), and the unfolding plot seemed a bit over the top leading me to feel that this tale requires a dose of 'suspension of reality' if the reader is to get the most out of it.  There's some good stuff though, admittedly.  One empathizes with the protagonist and celebrates along with him as the plot thickens and ultimately renders a sweet kind of justice that badly needed to happen to offset the injustice framing the original setting.  I'm glad that I read it, but would only rate it a B or B-minus.  The simple, declarative narrative style reminded me of Seargeant Joe Friday of Dragnet, for those folks of my generation who recall the no nonsense staccato monotone technique that characterized the opening lines of each episode.  Still there is a kind of fun factor, like one who might win a lottery, say, and who finds a way of avoiding government taxation on the full bounty.  We root for the protagonist, and he does alright for himself in the end.  So, I guess this falls into the comedy realm of literature.
B007TK77QE|2.0|I am 2 thirds through and am struggling every day to get to the end. I normally plough through a good book, but have been trying to finish this for 6 weeks. It still isn't going anywhere. I am waiting for the crescendo, the interesting tidbit, that keeps me wondering and looking forward to reading the next chapter. It is deadly boring, banal and leaves me asking why I paid good money for it. I am forever hopeful that the climax is worth it. Perhaps, it will not get there. Maybe, I won't bother finishing it......that would be a first.

B007FLHW3K|4.0|I just don't commute, I'm trying to survive in a world of distracted drivers where no one puts their cellphones down anymore so I must do something to attract their attention. Step 1: Aim my front blinking light a little high and slightly to the right so it reflects off of sidewalk street signs. Step 2: Add a 210 monkey light to my bike, as you ride it reflects off the ground giving you 360 degree visibility AND it \\"wierds people out\\" causing them to wonder \\"what the heck is that?\\" and being noticed while riding in traffic is what it's all about. Although I've lost the ability to adjust my color's and themes I still would recommend this product.
B009JZTOG8|4.0|The writers have fun re-interpreting centuries old fairy tales and inter-mingling them with our contemporary world.  This is such a great idea, because an important purpose of these tales always has been to help us understand our own flawed reality so we can learn how to deal better with it.<br /><br />One of this TV show's main themes is power.  How and why we gain it, how we use it, how it impact other people in our lives, etc.  Also, women are given stronger, more active and sometimes even more aggressive roles, which is nice most of the time.<br /><br />My only reserve is that occasionally, the feminist statement feels a bit overdone.  For example, is it really necessary that most of the female leads be able to face and defeat a band of 10 male soldiers single-handedly in sword combat?<br /><br />But overall, &#34;Once...&#34; is a well-done, creative and fun show that keeps the viewer hooked.
B007R6UWN0|4.0|Only four stars, since I'm not sure I could have followed the intertwining stories if I hadn't read the books -- and, of course, I noticed every place where the videos deviated from the books, especially when it didn't seem necessary for brevity or clarity.  But I think this was a masterful attempt to bring these stories to video, and enjoyed every minute of all six episodes.
B007XKEY6Q|3.0|I enjoy this game.<br />But like words with friends and scramble with friends, I had to delete b/c it messes up my kindle and andriod phone. :(
0374275637|5.0|WYSIATI; What You See is All There Is.  The book is a really fascinating discussion of how our intuition, when not checked by our more analytic side, can lead us to self-delusion: regression to the mean, the halo effect, replacing judgment by a formula. It is a difficult slog to be sure but the book is broken down into easily digestible chapters. It is one of the most intriguing books I have ever read and a must read (and re-read) by anyone contemplating a major decision.
B0060D196K|5.0|Movie is GREAT. Some dark moments for small kids, but the 3D effects were awesome. Good xmas movie for all.
B009PU2SX8|4.0|Something for everyone... My preference are the tracks based on the Blues more than the R&B tracks, but the R&B ones weren't bad either. Good Stuff.
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|As many other reviewers, I feel like this book is not as compelling as the beginning of the &#34;Hunger Games&#34; series.  I'm not sure why so many writers feel compelled to write trilogies, but they do, and they stumble.<br /><br />Suzanne Collins did good work with &#34;Mockingjay.&#34;  In general, this is solid and imaginative writing, and she brought the series to a thoughtful and logical conclusion.  So why isn't it quite satisfying?  Maybe some things are just best when left to the reader's imagination.
B0060CTLOI|5.0|Hercules was the best movie I have ever watched. The music makes it so cool cause the music is very catchey. But you never see The Great Thunder God Zeus be sad when Baby Hercules gets tooken away. But Hades is the punk........ well you know what I mean. But watch all the romance, action, funny, sad moments, and all the training. Remember go from &#34;Zero to Hero&#34; got it. Well watch Hercules, if you do you'll become a god youself

We are watching it now. If there are any problems, I will append my review. I don't mind buying used items, I just prefer to know it when I'm buying them. Buyer, beware!
B004BJMEO6|5.0|I'm a 68 year old white heterosexual male...who happens to LOVE relationship movies, and LESBIAN relationship movies in particular....and lesbian-meeting-and-loving-straight-woman-relationship movies even more!!<br />Those predilections taken into account, \\"Elena Undone\\" is the absolute BEST of that \\"genre\\"!!<br /><br />Before I saw \\"Elena\\", I'd watched \\"Room in Rome\\", and THAT movie became my #1 in the above genre.<br />(Previously, my favorite \\"lesbian\\" movie was \\"Everything Relative\\", but that movie is sorta like \\"The Big Chill\\" of lesbian movies.  Great flick, but NOT in the \\"lez loves straight\\" category!!)<br /><br />So, why is \\"Elena Undone\\" so fabulous??<br /><br />I'll begin with the story.<br />It's believable!<br />A married (15 years) woman with a teen son meets a lesbian at an adoption center.  Elena (a sensational Necar Zadegan) and her Pastor husband have tried, but failed to conceive a 2nd child.  Peyton (an also-sensational Traci Dinwiddie) is a woman whose mother just died, whose last relationship ended, but who wants to have a child.<br />It's an instant attraction!!<br />For both of them!!<br />For Peyton, it's easy.....she's met another woman she's very attracted to.<br />For Elena.....not so easy!!<br />She's NEVER been attracted to a woman, hasn't even kissed a woman...ever!<br /><br />The story follows their blossoming relationship, from first chats to a photo shoot (for Peyton's book cover...Elena is a GREAT photog!!) to deeper and deeper involvement....to their first long kiss (advertised as the \\"longest kiss in cinema history\\"!!)...to sex.<br /><br />But this is one story where the sex ACT isn't the be all-end all of the movie.<br />Nonetheless, it's beautifully done, erotic, sensual, poetic.<br /><br />I won't reveal what happens later.....You'll have to see the movie for that!....but problems DO arise, and how they deal with those problems makes the ending a real HUGE tearjerking few minutes!!<br />Yes, me, a 68 year old male, cried WET tears (not just a damp tear drifting down my cheek, but SOB-like crying!!) in the last 10 minutes of the film!!<br /><br />The actresses.<br />In one word, PERFECT!!<br />If you can think of any \\"name\\" actresses who could have done a better job, please let me know!!<br />They are beautiful, and display their emotions right up FRONT!!<br />You really believe these women ARE falling in love, and ARE lusting after the other!!<br /><br />The dialogue<br />As a writer for 47 years (and counting!), I MUST have GREAT dialogue to make me enjoy a movie (or TV show or book).<br />And \\"Elena Undone\\" has all that!!<br />I don't know if any of it was improvised (the dialogue, I mean), but it easily COULD have been!!<br />Because the words these women speak are words YOU have spoken in YOUR serious relationships...and words I've spoken in mine!!<br />Again, in one word, PERFECT!!<br /><br />Then there's the \\"extras\\".<br />Meaning the other characters.<br />Elena's best friend is a married male motivational speaker who's doing a documentary on \\"twin flames\\", people meeting their true soulmates.  (They're platonic friends!!)<br />Peyton's best friend is another lesbian she's known since high school.  She's a wise-cracking Brit (Her accent sounds British!!) who is always THERE for Peyton!!<br />Also, interspersed throughout are \\"real\\" (??) couples who tell the audience (or Elena's friend's camera!!) how they met and fell in love.  Reminded me a LOT of similar scenes from \\"When Harry Met Sally\\"!!<br />Then there's Elena's husband, who plays it kind of straightforward.<br />And their son, Nash, who has a key role in the movie.<br />Lastly, there's Nash's girlfriend, Tori, who is INCREDIBLE!!<br />Wait till you see and hear HER!!!<br /><br />All told,  if there's a \\"better\\" lesbian-loves-straight movie, with all the necessary elements--emotions, lust, love, sex, believability--please tell me its name!!<br /><br />For lesbians and straights alike (both female AND male variety!), \\"Elena Undone\\" is a MUST SEE movie!!
B0052BZ6X8|4.0|I enjoyed the movie however things were developed quickly an rapidly.  The story could have been so much better than it was and the plot developed more.  Clearly, this was set up for sequels but they fell short on this - has potential no doubt.  :-(
0547884591|5.0|I have been a fan of Tim for a long time. Reading 4HR Workweek (buying both editions), as well as 4HR Body. I just finished reading this one and have bought two more for gifts for my business partners.  You do not have to be a cook or passionate for cooking to appreciate all the work Tim puts into these things. I can't believe he got away with printing such an awesome looking book. Its more like a college textbook.  This book has made me revisit my copy of 4HR body and can happily say I hit the gym again yesterday for a short period of time which I have been MIA for months. Also went to the store and have been trying some of the recipes to get 30 in 30 (you will know when you read). Look forward to working more towards a better lifetyle with some of Tim's suggestions.

B008QTVNUI|1.0|Tried to watch with adult children based on rating, however the explicit sex in the first four episode was incredibly inappropriate and unnecessary. Will not finish, and would not recommend to anyone.
0547884591|5.0|Tim,<br /><br />This is my favorite book of yours. I loved 4HWW. I liked 4HB - but didn't go nuts over it. 4HC I think is a running succession of quick, encouraging wins, which you say is paramount to learning. Agreed.<br /><br />Last night while my kids slept I fast forwarded to your closing notes about August 11th (? date). Was really a very nice passage. Puts everything in perspective.<br /><br />Although I haven't had much success with launching my own profitable muse yet, I appreciate the quick, cheap wins in 4HC. I have made 4 dishes already (bought 3 days ago), but I'm a bit obsessed with how you draw out DSSS and Cafe. I'm trying to read the notes as much as possible.<br /><br />And to wrap it up especially creepily and weird - your books make me want to be a better man.<br /><br />Cheers guy, keep kicking ass, looking forward to the 4 Hour Parent.
0307891402|4.0|This guide has been a faithful companion to me since the game came out, it has helped me in so many ways I cannot even count and it feels so much more &#34;immersive&#34; to look up tricks and story information in this great tome then to just search on the internet.<br /><br />The book has a great feel to it and looks amazing, even if I am not playing the game I still take it out now and then just to browse it.

B007IXWL2C|5.0|Great book Great story there is a lot of sexual themes but underneath all of that is a great story about two people getting to know each other and their limits....
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This is by far the most beautiful and inspiring and touching books I have ever read. I just loved everything about it, the characters and their personalities, the jokes, the plot line, everything. I would recommend this book to anyone and everyone, and I truly think the world will end if everyone in it doesn't read this book.
B008K6HN8I|5.0|A must have. Great not just for my Kindle but also for accessing my Windows Home Server files. Has a nice little Player included as well. Added a lot of value to my Kindle immediately.
034580404X|4.0|Yes it was but the books are really written well.  I have finished two and have just started on the last one.

B007HU7NBK|3.0|It was great information on the band and a fun read but I thought that more detail could have been put into the work itself - it felt glossed over and a little hurried.  I would have liked more books (and gladly paid for them) and more information about each part / section touched on.  If you are a fan, you will enjoy the material.  I am so proud of John on how he had moved on with his life and sobriety ~
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Great book Great story there is a lot of sexual themes but underneath all of that is a great story about two people getting to know each other and their limits.... once you start reading this book you will not be able to put it down! make sure you have a long weekend
B0087JTAKW|5.0|I have been an avid fan of Albom's story weaving since I first read Tuesday' s with Morrie. This story has a delicate blend of real life trivialities and fundamental queries of existence that make it nothing short of a pleasure to read.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Well rounded and compelling characters, a mysterious world, and superb storytelling. What more could you want?<br /><br />I love a good mysterious world. \\"What's going on here? I dunno. Let's find out.\\" I say to myself. But a world (mysterious or not) full of empty people is no fun. And a good story poorly told is a drag as well. It's a rare joy to find a single work, especially in science fiction, that tells a story about such interesting characters and setting in such a readable way.<br /><br />Highly recommended.
B007W4OZ76|5.0|I installed this because it was necessary to access my Drop Box with this app.  Also the Drop / Box.net Client must be installed after this.  Then you must &#34;ADD&#34; your Drop Box through the explorer. You don't do anything with the Client once downloaded. My only caveat is the information concerning the whole downloading and installation could be much clearer by the corp.  I was able to set this up by reading the comments from other Users.  If you're not savvy on how these things work, give the other user's comments a gander before saying the thing doesn't work. Good Luck.

B005K0HDGE|4.0|I am about half way through this book and I really like it. It is not like the other books I have read by him; but it is an easy read and an interesting book.  Just finished the book and it was a really interesting read with lots of twists and turns in it.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|My wife and I can not get enough of this show, it makes you wanting more.  The acting, writing and setting all play hand-in-hand in delivering a true masterpiece (pun intended).
B0094BB4TW|3.0|I like this version of Facebook.  But it still doesn't really let me do stuff I want to do without drilling down through a few menus.  I know they have their own agenda with this service, and that is to maximize your time on it. However, I like to get on, do what I gotta do, or look for something from a friend, then get out and on with my day. I'm not that hip with staying on it for hours on end. All this being said, it's much better to do on the Fire than on my iPhone, and I suspect part of the reason is screen real estate.  You just get more with the fire, than with the iPhone 4.  Hopefully it'll keep improving.
B001EN71CW|5.0|Always wanted to get this but was always too high for me. As soon as amazon offered it for 25 bucks I had to get this. Its my favorite show ever and Josh Whedon is a master at anything he does. Great story and each actor was a perfect fit with the role they played. I cant imagine anyone else in ANY part.
B000001GYC|5.0|This is a most desirable pair of discs in so far as it is such a generous survey of works beyond the Songs without Words. This new and remastered edition offers an improved sound over its predecessor.<br /><br />Barenboim proves to be an ideal guide to this highly lyrical outpouring of Mendelssohn and it is the lyrical side that is mostly stressed. It needs to be noted that the remastering in the later edition rectifies the rather shallow and bass light sound balance of the previous edition and provides additional clarity too. The sound is now clearly preferable to my ears in this newer mastering.<br /><br />This pair of discs includes far more than the complete Songs as it continues with the Kinderstucke, Gondellied, the two Klavierstucke and concludes finally with the very popular Albumblatt. This comprehensive selection is unique on disc and makes the set even more attractive. However I would also suggest that the partial survey of the Songs plus other works by Sebastian Knauer is a worthy competitor with even better sound and equally sympathetic playing.<br /><br />At the moment Barenboim has the added advantage of a very low price on this lower priced and re-mastered complete edition compared to Knauer' selection. Knauer has the advantage of sound quality plus arguably even more attractive playing. My suggestion would be to buy both Barenboim and Knauer if at all possible.

B00000425L|5.0|For many collectors Ashkenazy and Rachmaninov makes a powerful and potent combination almost beyond compare.Ever since he burst upon the recording scene in 1963 with a marvellous Piano Concerto 3 Ashkenazy has produced winning disc after winning disc of the Rachmaninov repertoire.<br /><br />Apart from his fabulous technical skills he brings that innate sense of 'Russianness' to his interpretations. There are the uninhibited emotional outbursts, the bleak desolation, the sense of the epic and also the introspection to list but a few of the complex elements that go to make up the complete musical experience. All of these conflicting aspects of Rachmaninov, his world and his music are laid bare before us.<br /><br />There are many fine sets of the 24 Preludes, and I own quite a few of them plus partial sets by Richter among others, yet Ashkenazy brings a sense of absolute authenticity to these readings. Others may excel in many ways but the combination of elements that Ashkenazy creates is very special and specially Russian.<br /><br />Much the same can be observed about the second sonata. This is available in the original full length, the shortened and more compact second version plus various hybrid versions. Ashkenazy chooses to play the first version which many now believe to be the best. Ashkenazy obviously thinks so too and makes a very convincing case for it. There is no sense of the undue length that Rachmaninov feared as a result of critical opinion that was probably best ignored.<br /><br />Decca has now reissued and repackaged the performances and recordings of these works in this generously filled set which makes a particularly tempting pair of discs.<br /><br />I would suggest that whatever other recordings you own of this music, these Ashkenazy discs deserve the most serious consideration for any collection or understanding of the Rachmaninov world. I would also suggest that no lover of Rachmaninov can really afford to miss this opportunity to extend their understanding with such a guide at such a reasonable price.<br /><br />........................................<br /><br />Some dialogue from the comments section that may offer further help:<br /><br />Great review as always Ian and you have tempted me to buy these Ashkenazy/Rachmaninov discs. I have his recordings of the Rachmaninov Piano Concertos and love those as well. (U.K. review)h a reasonable price.    ........................................    Some dialogue from the comments section that may offer further help:    Great review as always Ian and you have tempted me to buy these Ashkenazy/Rachmaninov discs.

B00701897I|4.0|It's a funny movie, but the 3D quality is not as good. For me it's the same blue ray and blue ray 3D version. If you purchase the movie, buy the blue ray version normal.
B008K5T5AI|5.0|I love the Culture. This book deals with the foundation of the Culture and the process which leads a civilisation Sublimes. Well written and I'm going to stop now before I say anything to rune anything.<br /><br />If you have loved the other Culture you will most likely love this one.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I've been a zombie junkie ever since Resident Evil, I'm also into apocalyptic shows. Walking Dead brings both of those aspects to the table and unlike shows like Evolution has a lot more realism to boot.<br /><br />I've watched season 1 and 2 and this season is not a let down, its raising the bar even one more notch.<br /><br />The moment each episode ends I'm already wishing I could fast forward to next week!
B001AH6ZWY|4.0|A movie as much about philosophy, religion, and the intersection of the two as it is about finding and contacting alien life, this movie manages to engage the mind as well as instill a sense of wonder.  It smartly raises questions but doesn't offer concrete answers, leaving the \\"right\\" answer to the viewer. Solid performances by the whole cast.
B005LLSNNE|5.0|Awesome product, easy to view, was able to watch episodes anytime, anywhere.  I could pause, and resume easily.  LOVE IT!

B008COII1Y|3.0|The mixing of zombies and civil war era was what caught my interest in watching this. For a zombie movie lover its worth watching, but if your not a zombie freak don't waste your time.
0547884591|5.0|Swiss army knifes are used as metaphors as a survival tool and a multipurpose gadget. This book is both. Teaching you how hunt a deer and survive in the wild, Super-fast learning (Meta-Learning), making 3-pointer basketball shots, oh and how to be an awesome cook.

B008Y1YK0I|1.0|The movie is great, and in general, so is the Blu=Ray; however:<br /><br />1. There are two scenes when the audio is not in sync with the picture. Seems like if they worked this long on creating the Blu-ray, there would not be scenes with the audio out of sync.<br /><br />2. Ultraviolet is terrible. To even try to download the movie, I had to upgrade programs on my computer, create a Sony account that gave them a lot of personal information and then I had to circumvent the standard security on my Mac to allow the movie to download. However, even at that, the Sony download manager repeatedly failed. After nine hours, I still do not have a playable version on my computer.<br /><br />In general, Ultraviolet stinks. I'd rather pay less for a movie and not have a digital copy than use Ultraviolet. First, some movies only stream. What good does that do me on an airplane at 30,000 feet? And why would I want to stream a movie when I own a Blu-Ray copy? I'm done with Ultraviolet. I may buy a movie that has it as an option, but only because I want the movie. I'm not wasting another minute of my life trying to set up an Ultraviolet movie for playing on a portable device.
B009OA57MI|1.0|this game is awesome, well worth the 1.99 and would pay for more.  but, it locks up on my kindle, after hard rebooting the kindle i cant play that same level with it freezing.  i also have the carrier landing game and 0 issues on that one. so whatever is in that version that is not in this, it needs to be fixed.  i would give it 8 stars if (i could) and it didnt lock up.  PLEASE fix!

B000EWBNMS|5.0|Might be my favorite series of all time.  Love story, ghost story, psychic ability and mystery all in one.......and all based on a REAL person.  It lacks nothing!  There should be a Super Emmy for this show!
B0067R0APK|4.0|a very good app. although the paid version shouldn't bother you to create a review. if I pay money for an app you should quit bothering the purchaser.
B002XTXFU8|5.0|Bronson is an interesting look at the life of Britain's most violent criminal.  It portrays Bronson as an unapologetic monster, yet adds a surprising amount of humanity.  Tom Hardy is scary good at making you flinch or making you laugh.  Bronson is certainly not a Friday night Family Film.  It's graphic and very deserving of the R-Rating.  However, it is not a movie you should miss.
B00A3AUGEW|4.0|I watched and voted for Phillip on American Idol.  His Cd did not disappoint.  I enjoyed every one of the songs.
0525952926|5.0|We can hardly wait for the publication of the third in this triology.  I am already recommending the first two to family and friends.  Follett is a very talented author.  This is a great way to get another perspective on history during the 1900's.

Your fans demand the uncut extended versions LIKE THAT ARE ON THE DVDs.<br /><br />I was all excited about this and had it on pre-order.  As soon as I heard the news about these being the short 'tv' episodes, I cancelled immediately.<br /><br />Extremely disappointed.
B00932A6G4|1.0|Had none of the camp I loved from the original movie. Animation was ok at best. No real reason to ever waist your money on it.

B002UNMW7O|5.0|absollutely  loved this movie ..and the way it was  filmed  very creative ..love the hero's ! all of them ..<br />I only wish there were a third ....<br />It's rare to find a movie actually worth spending the time and money to watch ...<br />this is what movie making is all about ...who doesn't  love  vigilante justice !
B002SR3T10|3.0|Jethro Tull has always been one of the most creative artists and I was not disappointed by the music on this album.  I was, however, a little disappointed that it was just an LP album that had been recorded to digital, no remastering.  You can hear some of the dust pops when playing this CD, but the music is fantastic.  A great Holiday album.
B009E3EY4M|5.0|At a live show, we experience one thing; when watching the Blu-ray version at home, another. It becoomes a new art form, a new way of experiencing the show. The editing puts you on stage with the performers, you see their eyes meeting each other, playing off each other, creating an intimacy between you and the band that you cant attain at a live event. I choose to respect the \\"art\\" direction and editing as part of the whole.  Just like the distortion level of Jimmy's amps, which some found irritating, I embraced it because it was how Jimmy wanted it to sound, not too slick, still defiant and original.  The DTS MasterHD soundtrack is bit-for-bit identical to original master recording, on my full range high end audio system with 111\\" diagonal HD projection, it was literally better than being there....dont let any criticism here dissuade you from owning this astounding work of art.  It is epic.  It will stand the test of time as the best rock show by any band ever, a testament to the talent of these aging yet still vital artists.  If there was ever a better reason to step up to Blu-ray, I have not seen it.
0553801473|5.0|He better get that 6th (and 7th?) volume done FAST  I am OLD and I want to live to read it!  Excellent story.
B009NQKPUW|3.0|For all of the hype it was not as good as it could have been. The graphics were amazing the actors were good and the story was poor to say the least. The best part of this movie was watching the previews.
B007BZM3HK|3.0|This song is one of my daughter and my favorites  and was clear quality. I would definetly buy more for her.
B009HV2JT8|3.0|The movie as a whole was good.  The only thing I would say is there was too much leaning on CGI for some of the action scenes.
B00846TRHY|5.0|Inspiring movie about sacrifice and shows some of what happens to children in less fortunate countries. Liked that it was based on a true story, and the transformation of main character. Felt realistic. After seeing the terrible things happening to children in Sudan I respect his decision to fight back. We have it so good in America. The movie left me thinking of ways I can help others outside of my own little world. Has a convicting plot with great message. Lot of swearing in the beginning before his conversion though if any younger viewers.
B000RO9VJK|5.0|Was completely uneducated about how to run and grow a business until I read this book. I no longer a burnt out business owner.
B008Z9YLV2|5.0|Of course you are not going to get the story granularity,  nor the deep character development, that you get from the written word, but its all there.  The characters in the movie were not as flamboyant and excessive as my imagination painted them in the book, but it was a fun adventure.  There is some implicated violence, mostly just off-camera, but the blood does get spurty occasionally so keep a pillow handy to cover your eyes if you are squeemish.  Cant wait for the sequel.
0345803485|5.0|Throughly enjoyed all three books!!!!! I am grateful i did not let any negative review stop me from reading all three books. I spent all weekend reading them back to back. What an interesting story of a person managing to find life again after starting life in an horrific start as a child that has a happy ending because he strived to better his life and gave love a chance. I have a fascination for BDSM from the aspect of freedom to explore from the view of a loving couple which is aspected in these books. Well done.
B007P3Q95K|5.0|Buy an 'all region' DVD player and you can buy domestically or 'across the pond'. I agree with you at every level, so I purchased an all-region player and love it. Actually wanted a DVD \\"PharLap\\" that was only available in Region 4, so I purchased a 'all-region' player.<br /><br />On Amazon.com,for about $50 you can get a Samsung all-region that upconverts to HD and the picture is really good.<br /><br />No need to wait or complain.
B00A6PD8RQ|3.0|The graphics were excellent. The story fell short. I lost interest when the mother turned into a bear. That's all.
030758660X|4.0|While I am far from being what one would call a Twilight fan in any way, shape, or form, I picked up this book in a store out of sheer curiosity. I enjoy vampires as well as knitting, and seeing this label on a shelf was not something I could ignore. I loved the projects, the layout of the book, the photos and artistic styles in it, so I can ignore the Twilight aspects easily.<br /><br />My first project was the Tourniquet Scarf, and now I have people asking me all the time to make one for them. It has a good variety of difficulty levels, a good selection of different projects, and I can hardly wait to make more projects from this book.
B008ASLK8A|3.0|It lacked some of the new concepts of the first one.  There were fighting scenes that should have crippled both parties but, they just kept plugging along.  The movie could have been shorter by 20 to 30 minutes
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|this is nice, wish i could shake it more it almost plays like the real ones, just happy it doesn't cost each coin
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This is a fast read, very heart warming, coming to age story, and the ending brings it all together perfectly.
B006YC74E8|4.0|i like having access to a camera on my kindle fire. hopefully will get to know how to use it better as i experiment with it
B00006RIO7|4.0|She enjoyed the film, the original broadway production, and we've seen the play twice, so it was a no-brainer decision.
B009GEEMLY|5.0|There is no &#34;down time&#34; in this movie. It's one big fight scene! All the personality conflicts and alliances from the comic books are here. Well worth your time.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|My teenage son saw the marathon on AMC recently.  He wanted to be caught up on what's going on so we watched what we missed the first two seasons on Netflix, & the beginning of season 3 on Amazon (very good picture). Saw the new episode last night & awaiting to watch next week.  Awesome show.  My husband finds it interesting.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|NEVER LIKED ZOMBIE MOVIES BUT THIS IS THE BEST . GREAT STORY LINE, STRONG CHARACTERS, REAL FEEL ABOUT THE APOCALYPSE
B00005JLCI|5.0|A birthday gift to a gentlemen who has taught advance-placement English. &#34;The best film of Hamlet I have seen and I have seen them all!&#34;
B007Y56JDQ|5.0|Well first off, Richard is an amazing artist, and with Hugh and JC, Matt & the band and the amazing Sara Neimetz, it was more than fabulous. Richard really \\"botoxed\\" some of his older very popular songs and made them even better. and the fact that I am in the DVD several times made it a real \\"memory maker\\" for me. Richard is one of those rare artists that actually sounds better as he has gotten older. If you were at this show, you went as a fan, and left feeling like you were at the best party of your life....thus far :)
B002QBS9KE|5.0|I appreciate the fact I was able to buy just the replaceable piece of a great bluetooth headset.  These are meant to wear out and this was an easy purchase to make.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|This  is a fun and silly game thst keeps my 5 year old busy foras long as I let her play
B006YG9HJE|5.0|This is the best season of television I've ever seen. Season one was very well done. It built a great foundation of character development, story, plot, and action. Season two took it to a new level of entertainment.<br /><br />I honestly can't say enough how much I enjoyed this season. It was masterful. So much happened in one season, yet it didn't feel jumbled, confusing, or contrived. The allegiances, plot twists, and action flowed smoothly and the story was paced perfectly.<br /><br />The most enjoyable part of the story was Nikita's level of conviction to her cause. A character's conviction is a vital element to any drama. If a story is written right, we feel the same level of conviction as the character(s). This season was written right.<br /><br />While watching the show you will cheer for her when she succeeds, you will feel the anguish of her losses, and you will believe in her cause.<br /><br />Best. Season. Ever.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|fresh spin on classic FEAR . The Acting is superb. i like the familiar faces jessica lange evan peters AWESOME
1619695006|1.0|Disappointing.  Depressing. Disgusting.<br />I pre-ordered this audio book so we could enjoy Rowlings newest effort on our road trip. We had loved listening to the amazing Harry Potter series and expected this novel to be even more wonderful.  Wrong.<br />Characters are despicable. Plot is absent. Raw language is icky. It's a boring \\"small fish in a small pond\\" waste of anyone's valuable time. Life is too short.  The characters' lives in this novel were too long.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Hold on to your panties girls, you are in for the ride of your life! Roller coasters ain't got nothing on Ms. Day!
B005CKPQNE|5.0|This is one of those movies that kept me on the edge of my seat,<br />always wondering what was coming next.  Great entertainment!
B003AYMZO2|5.0|Love this show. Should have started to watch it much sooner.  Looking forward to the rest of the remaining seasons and shows.
B00A77II0U|5.0|The story, game play and graphics are all great! I'm a big fan of adventure games, and this one did not disappoint. As other commenters have mentioned, I highly recommend playing it on the more challenging setting. It is nice having the option for hints built into the game as well, especially because you can just use it to see if you are on the correct screen. That saves a lot of frustration.<br />It will likely only take you a couple of days to complete, but this game is well worth the price. If you like adventure games and/or hidden object games and are not sure whether to buy it, buy it. You won't be disappointed.<br /><br />I played this game on my Kindle Fire HD with no issues.
B002NZTZ8S|5.0|A good family holiday season movie.  Wonderful graphics. Really enjoyed it.The story line is very good.Everyone needs to watch it.
B009ERK1T0|5.0|I have been a long time Deftones fan, they were the very first show I ever attended. Stone Pony in Asbury Park with openers Limp Bizkit and Will Haven. Well 15 years later they continue to put out great albums. This new one its a perfect combo of their older aggressive sound with the newer more atmospheric leanings. From starts to finish this album delivers and you should pick up a copy.
0345803485|4.0|The book is entertaining.<br />Probably 80% of writers out there could have written it, but hey! they didn't. Some one took the time to write it and people take the time to read it.<br />That's what is all about.<br />Get over it.<br />You either read it to be entertained or you don't.<br />Now stop complaining.
B000UYJR7I|4.0|Good plot, with solid acting and plenty of eye candy, just wish the ending was a bit less soft. Overall a good headscratcher
B001LOU6ZS|4.0|I listened to this on tape when it came out in 1983 and was pleased to hear it once again. UFO still Rocks!
B006LSZECO|5.0|Super twists and turns!  This books grabs you right away and has an ending that is completely unpredictable and topsy turvy!  Great holiday read!
0547884591|5.0|I pre-orded 4HourChef on Amazon and received it the day it launched. Cracking this book open was a delight. It feels like an advanced science textbook only one that I really want to read. The first few pages describing how the book is laid out in 5 sections was a great lead in.<br /><br />My only concern is that I'm pretty sure that once I get through it the book is going to be a lot more expensive that it's title cover. All the neat stuff I'm about to learn is going to lead to some expensive hobbies I hope.<br /><br />I am even more excited about this than I was 4 hour body which I also got on launch day. As for the content of the book that I've read so far it's extremely well laid out. By that I mean it's a page turner that progresses logically and each new page is an adventure.<br /><br />As soon as I opened the package a big smile came out and I thought, \\"That MFr did it again\\". The MFr in reference is of course Mr. Ferriss.
0547884591|5.0|I loved Tim Ferriss's last two books so it comes as no surprise that I was eagerly anticipating this one. I'm just glad that it lived up to the hype (self-induced.) Okay before I get to the actual content this review wouldn't be complete without mention the physical copy of the book. I own an Amazon Kindle but there was no way in hell that I was not getting it in print-the book really is an artifact.<br /><br />In regards to the actual content, there really is something in there for everyone. I accept that most people are skeptical about some of the claims that Tim makes however setting aside his marketing (which I think is great) the book can be put to great use. People always talk about 'making their money back' and you only have to read the first 100 pages to do this. What's more, even if you never cook after reading this, the chapter alone on making the perfect coffee will be worth your time or the chapters on the principles Tim uses to learn languages.<br /><br />Enjoy the book!
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|This was a fantastic movie.  The whole family loved it--the boys with the evil parts  and the girls with the sweet funny stuff!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|this is a fun game my son turned me on to. i have it on my kindle and my smartphone
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This game is addictive and a great way to pass the time!  It is simple to learn with very few rules but every level gets more challenging.
1451629184|5.0|.Poor child and the life and abuse she went through riigth under police and  social workers eyes.  Even the patrol officer - that person needs to find a new job because with the perp's record he/she have made  checks of hat home every time he was there.  Shame SHAME
B000Y5JFNY|5.0|I bought this as a gift for my partner, because he loves the movie (and so do I), and i think it happened to be one of the best purchases I've ever made. The set is beautifully put together, and the extras are really well made - which is good because sometimes we pay a lot of money for cheaply-built things.  The music box is lovely (though it plays just a few second of favorite things, it could play a bit more) and Its being used to store some favorite things indeed.<br /><br />If you like this classic you will do well to buy this edition.
B0094BB4TW|1.0|When you go to your News Feed only a few news items are displayed - as you scroll down in the center of the page is a refreshing/updating circle which appears like it is working to upload more news feed stories but nothing ever appears.  At first I thought this was because of the internet connection I had but I used another device on the same internet service and it worked fine so something is wrong with the app.  This issue makes the app worthless to me.
0393327345|5.0|I sat down to read a little part of this book while eating mac and cheese. Ended up clearing the rest of my afternoon and evening for it. Great book. Better than the movie.
B001ANSSDC|3.0|I was disappointed with the book. There was too much talk about football and not enough details about each of the characters.. =(
B001DTPZNY|5.0|How can you go wrong with Indiana Jones?  Well, except for the second of series of four.  This is a good movie and a &#34;must have&#34; to complete the collection if you bought the original trilogy before this movie was out on DVD.
B009A9BF5G|5.0|Being very into music, iam a bluray concert collector.<br />This was superb it even made me tear up.<br /><br />Love the commentating every now and then.<br /><br />A Must for Cold Play lovers!
1401201911|5.0|Honestly I'm not even that of a fan of superman, but Red Son is really brilliant. It takes you in depth on superman thinking and it is the first time I actually cared about what Lex Luthor was doing.<br />Red son has really great moments and anyone interested in comics should read it.
B000HKW7E0|5.0|This is a classic Christmas movie that looks so much better on blue ray than dvd.<br />My family loves it.

B000FBFN1U|5.0|Good read.  Wondering where it will go. A lot of time spent on characters that are dying though. Hoping that the next book takes the story further.
B004QZ9PLU|4.0|I loved this book!  It was just as good as all the other NICHOLAS SPARKS books.  If you have read any other books by Nicholas Sparks don't miss reading this one.
B007JF87VS|5.0|Always a great story from The Walking Dead! Can never get enough. The more zombies the better and this episode delivers!
B004J4XGN6|4.0|This is a really good book - great lessons and content. It gets kinda slow near the end, like someone was trying to meet a minimum page requirement.
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|This book has really helped me be more understanding in my relationship. I do wish though, that my boyfriend would have read this so he can better understand me. He hasn't picked up a book in ages though.

B000QCS8TW|5.0|A great start to what I hope is a worthwhile series.  Martin makes the characters and landscapes easy to visualize.
B0096DZKZC|4.0|I remember playing sonic on Sega Genesis and this brings that back.  Downside...the controls could be better as they don't respond the best on screen, almost needs a separate controller to fully enjoy.
B00A5IXI7O|1.0|The acting and the script for this a<br />Alfred Hitchcock movie are horrible. Save your money and order one of his later movies.
B007PT3QOQ|2.0|game is constantly shutting down. I loved this game as s kid and loved playing this version. it would be nice to play past the level I'm on.
B0094BB4TW|4.0|This app starts up quickly, connects to my facebook account simply and works great. I've not used it many times and I'm sure once I'm used to the app I won't have any issues with it. On initial use though I'm not crazy about how it's laid out. Seems like there should be short tutorial on the app itself to show where the buttons and all are located. Other than that it works good.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Good puzzle game that's lots of fun very challenging at times and addicting. Perfect for all age groups!!Make more please.
B000FC1HBY|5.0|Very engaging.  A good plot line that is well developed.  Almost too complex, but not quite.  Very believable characters.  Good continuation of the first book.
0307946711|2.0|I bought this book for the excellent rating it has, but don't know how I managed to get to the end. The book is very drawn out, slow, as if nothing happened even lasting 20 years. Don't want to spoil, but the end is terrible, not just because it's tragic, but it would be anyway. Disappointing, not the worst book ever, but there are many other better books waiting for us.
B00A6PD9I4|5.0|I appreciate the movie's very strong female point of view to the story. The heroine, Merida, is the main character. There is no handsome prince. The movie is mostly about the relationship of two strong women, Merida and her mother. This is an important story. It is important that it sets strong role models for young girls and it expands the pantheon of Disney princesses.<br /><br />Merida is a master at riding her horse Angus and is an extremely skilled archer. As with many teenage women Merida is at odds with her traditionally minded mother. In the scene when Merida declares, \\"I am Merida. Firstborn descendant of Clan DunBroch. And I'll be shooting for my own hand!\\" My red-headed, freckled five year old granddaughter squealed with delight and has been repeating the line with a Scottish accent ever since. This is a movie with a little bit of battle scene violence but the story is well worth it.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|This is a good book.  After hearing all the hype I had to see what this book was all about.  And I must say it was well worth it.  I couldn't stop reading this.
B005HSL626|4.0|I enjoy fruit ninja. I don't think it will take me long to get tired of playing it but for a free app it's great. The ads aren't too often or intrusive and the gameplay is paced fast enough to not get bored.
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|Just as fun as the original. Fantastic for kids. Just as fun and challenging as the original. Love the backround music for the different seasons!!
B0086700CM|5.0|its a great game I love it.l play it so much my fingers hurt.I. play it so much I only have one more person left to get.

B0076DCT2G|4.0|Enjoyed the in depth look at personalities.  Not a lot of action until the end.  Definitly keeps your interest, a good read.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This is a good book.  After hearing all the hype I had to see what this book was all about.  And I must say it was well worth it.  I couldn't stop reading this.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love love LOVE YouVersion!! If you like to dive into and research God's Word then you will too. One can read the Word in King James Version then compare it in the Amplified or New Living Translations. I also absolutely love the reading plans. The only problem I've come across is that I tend to sign up for too many reading plans on my days off work then can't keep up once I go back to work. This is the best app I've come across.
B008OOYALE|4.0|Good graphics. Good fun. The food is a bit confusing. I don't know if the different food is fir certain dragons. I just like playing.
B009IA3O2O|4.0|When I saw them live recently, I thought Tommy Karevik's renditions of Roy Kahn's songs sounded like an admittedly-very-talented vocalist singing karaoke. I was anxious to hear what he'd sound like singing songs meant for him, and he doesn't disappoint. This album is easily on par with &#34;The Black Halo&#34; and &#34;Ghost Opera,&#34; and it's miles above &#34;Poetry for the Poisoned.&#34;
B005LAIHY0|5.0|I was a bit apprehensive as I had heard and read so many mixed reviews of this film when it was first out so I had waited for the disk release.<br />I really liked this movie! Beautiful visual effects in the movie, I hope it gets an Oscar for those visuals!<br />I read that this was supposed to be a 'stand alone' film and NOT a prequel to the &#34;Alien&#34; series, but to me it is more of a 'beginning' with the possibility of a whole new story arc. I don't think it will (or should) be a restart considering where the Alien vs Predator series went and just go with the beginning of the entire franchise. My opinion.<br />If you like this kind of movie, and haven't seen it yet, I, along with many others recommend it!
B009KHDT0C|4.0|I love Johnny Depp and will watch him in any movie. This movie is entertaining and fun. Michelle Pfeiffer is stunningly beautiful as always. Johnny Depp is so in character as always. I enjoyed the movie and it seemed to move a quick pace.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This is a great book.  Before seeing the movie I read all the books and absolutely loved it.  I have read this three times.
B004SJ3BCI|3.0|For a free game, this game isn't bad. It could be a little faster paced especially after the bird hits the target and is ever so slowly rolling on the ground. It is simple to learn and easy to play over and over again.
B005FISBTO|5.0|This season was great-  I thought the religious overtones were very well done.  Dexter's reactions are actually funny yet cynical.  the ending really is compelling- I can't wait to see the next season!
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Probably the best series I've ever watched.  I am totally addicted and I am no horror buff!  I recommend this show.
B004XJRQUQ|4.0|Was advised by a number of people I would enjoy this trilogy...<br />don't know why I took so long in doing so, but once I started I couldn't stop.
B005DF2QMC|5.0|This worked great for me. I had a bunch of my children's stories on tape and wanted to be able to share them with my grand children.

B00AA0TJO8|5.0|it kinda makes me mad about the fact that it makes you restart the whole level when you die but I like it otherwise
B004SIIBGU|5.0|So much easier than having to get to the eBay website and then try to search on a tiny little screen.  Would definitely recommend this app to others :0)
B007IXWL2C|3.0|This was a book for our book club and I thought it was going to be pornographic and way too salacious for the club.  To my surprise is was sexy but not too over the top. The lead character, shy and inexperienced, said things like 'he kissed me down there..'.  You get the picture, now don't get me wrong, they had a lot of sex, a lot.  So much so that I sometimes skipped a paragraph or two.  After all how many times must we read about being tied up or blind folded or their kinky escapades. Parts were funny, sometimes laugh out loud funny.  I was not too crazy about the direction the characters went and how she summed up the ending.  Christian was so twisted, it could have gone in many directions.<br /><br />Now to sum it up, you have to remember, she was 22? and he was 27ish, both so young and I thought too young to settle things the way they did.  I didn't like how submissive she came across even though she was not his submissive.  She always acquiesced to his every demand, whim, desire.  Where was her backbone?  He was a bit of a stalker, so much so that if he wasn't tall, handsome, and rich, she would have had a retraining order on him from the 1st book.  What can I say, I liked it enough to read all three, mainly to see where the author was going to take the characters.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This is a great book.  Before seeing the movie I read all the books and absolutely loved it.  I have read this three times.
B00A4GXJD0|5.0|Outstanding except the rap song which sucked, Mr. Rock 'n Roll is his best song ever! Plus no ripping off of other songs.
B00119ZMKW|5.0|The episode I got &#34;Abyss&#34; was the first episode in which the newly ascended Daniel comes to Jack.  At first Jack doesn't believe it is really Daniel, but eventually Daniel convinces Jack that it is really him just not in corporal form.  The back and forth banter is still there, and the last scene where Daniel and Jack say goodbye again shows just how close they really are. Must see for SG1 fans.
B00466HM28|4.0|mini size fits me just right. I have already a full version.<br />I thought of getting a mini one to use as travel.<br />I have used this to created 4+ song instrumental already<br />Easy to use & easy to set up assuming you have knowledge of it<br />Shouldn't be a problem!<br />GOod Quality Good Product.
B005LAIHY0|1.0|Zero plot and/or character development.<br />Huge logic breaks.<br />Outdoor' special effects were very limited.<br />Horrible acting - in particular, but not limited to Charlize Theron.<br /><br />I really was looking forward to this.<br /><br />A shame, really.
B0041T52S6|5.0|Great flick, very fun, especially for gamers.  Very fast-paced with lots of details for you to notice with subsequent viewings.  Fun to watch again and again
0547884591|4.0|I am really enjoying the book and learning lots of new tips that should improve my skills in a variety of areas not just cooking.  One of the beautiful things about this book is that you can choose which skills he highlights that you want to learn and practice them till you master them the other skills which you may not want to learn you can ignore.  One of the themes that runs through his three books The 4 Hour Work-Week & The 4 Hour Body & This one are that you should be a master of your own time and that if you apply yourself you can learn to do anything.  With this book he teaches you how to break down a skill into the components of what you need to learn and how to master the components and then skill quickly.  Developing this skill set alone is worth buying and reading the book.<br /><br />The biggest drawback for me personally was I was hoping this would be a book I could share with my daughter (10).  She already likes to cook but she is at an age where if she should begin to learn the skills to become a meta-learner.  Sadly, some references in the book are not what I consider appropriate for a girl her age.  In a few years, I would have no problem with it.  So if he would edit down the book for the 9-15 year old set I think he would have another winner.  Just think of generation of kids growing up having learned that their is no skill they couldn't master quickly; the world would be their oyster.  On the other hand, I guess I will be spending more Father-Daughter time teaching her these skills together which isn't a bad thing either.<br /><br />Safe journeys fellow travelers.
B00A6PD8RQ|5.0|The kids and I really enjoyed this movie. I will  be buying the DVD. My husband even enjoyed it. Thanks.
B009VB7QQA|4.0|This was a fun premise that I wasn't expecting too much out of from the start. That being said, it definitely exceeded my expectations. The only thing I wanted more of was vampire killing!
0385535147|3.0|Grisham is a skillful writer and a creative plotter.  He did a particularly excellent job of describing life in prison, making it exceptionally vivid.  However, once the prison is described there is a VERY long period of set-up for the plot.  It's worth slogging on as the second half of the book moves rapidly and entertainingly to the denoument.  I really liked the O. Henry-ish twist at the end but I won't spoil it for other readers by describing it.<br /><br />It's not a legal thriller in the style of a Grippando, Parker or Rosenberg.  However, it is a fast-moving action thriller. I'd agree with others that it would make an excellent movie.<br /><br />If you have a trip in your future, or some time on the beach, or just a free afternoon, you can't go wrong in settling down with this book.  The story won't remain with you, the intricacies of the law and bureaucratic politics won't strike you as wholly credible, there is nothing to discuss with friends....but you will be entertained.  Even a less-than-brilliant Grisham provides good reading and that is certainly the case here.
B008PCVGKI|5.0|As a clinical dietitian and beginning researcher this was a fascinating read. One of this books strengths is that it brings together all the factors that make it difficult for clinicians to find out the facts about products that they prescribe. The book is well referenced and well written
B009CPJHY4|3.0|A pleasant jaunt to another land with mildly intriguing characters and a plausible story. Innocuously entertaining but not much more.
B003NTSBUG|4.0|It's refreshing to see a genuine movie replace all of the numbingly repetitious Criminal Minds/Sexual Predator series on television.  (\\"Shutter island\\" is showing on USA cable 2 days after Black Friday.)  I can just see Scorsese and the writer of the original story brainstorming this film before shooting it. Each movie mind becomes more excited than the other guy while drawing upon sources like those in my title.  Doestoevsky's \\"Notes from the Underground\\"--which pushes to the limit questions like who's insane in a world where insanity rules and where, I, at least, am \\"on to\\" the pervasiveness of insanity? And since I have sufficient self-awareness to acknowledge my own insanity, doesn't that set me apart as less insane than the other inmates who imagine themselves as free agents in a \\"normal\\" social order?  And since we're talking about a world where God is the script-writer/institutional monarch/rule-maker, why not bring in the director of \\"Through a Glass Darkly\\" (Ingmar Bergman) and his filmstar/ theological quester/avatar (Max Von Sydow)? And let's borrow some of the cultish sci-fi philosophy of Chris Marker's penetrating film lobotomy of love and human memory (\\"La Jetee\\").  Also, for good measure, let's put Alfred Hitchock's signature on it (just as he would have done) for a bit of inside humor. And let's call it \\"Shutter Island\\" as a reference to existential closure within our  dehumanizing, isolated, inescapable reality (which has become a digitalized, virtual simulacrum), but simultaneously gratify those viewers whose memory of a cinematic medium extends to that French neo-realist (Godard) who defined film, in terms of shutter speed, as: \\"truth 24 times per second.\\"<br /><br />It's a dangerously unwieldy, chaotic mix, made cinematically possible through an artifical, Gothic mis-en-scene, all of which is captured on non-realistic, grainy, high-contrast film stock in addition to montage that, more than recent similar products, virtually \\"ferries\\" the spectator between the external world of the protagonist's present and the psychological, internal world of his past.  And to a great degree it all works.  Unlike the irrelevant fantasies and pointless mind-games of DiCaprio's own \\"Deception\\"--cinematic fluff unworthy of a grown-up's time--\\"Shutter Island\\" has backbone, tradition, and significance--and a powerful, driving theme--that make it possible to follow the purposefully unstable narrative while making us as viewers \\"care\\" enough to actually \\"want\\" to sort through the dream/reality sequences.  We care, moreover, because we sense that somehow the position of DiCapria's character resembles our own situation at the end of the new millennium's first decade.<br /><br />The paradigm, if not actual blueprint, for \\"Shutter Island\\" is Robert Wiene's 1919 German expressionist psychodrama \\"Cabinet of Caligari\\" in which we follow the struggles of the protagonist Francis to deal with a murderous killer-somnambulist, Dr. Caligari.  In the end, we discover that Francis--who is, like DiCaprio, our point of reference--is actually an inmate in a mental institution. Moreover, the insidious murderers--Dr. Caligari and his somnambulist-agent, Cesare--are projections fabricated by Francis to protect himself from his own guilt. American audiences in 1920 were unprepared for such strong stuff, and so an actor was appointed to walk out at movie's end and assure the crowd of theater spectators that Francis would be cured and returned to normal, \\"sane\\" society.  (This was before the rise of the Third Reich!)  In \\"Shutter Island\\" DiCaprio's failure to break free of his obsessive guilt and identity-destroying defense mechanisms sentences him to a far more depressing cure--the loss of all humanity and memory.  In effect, he pronounces sentence on his insane self from the vantage point of a newly sane mind.<br /><br />There is a flickering light of hope when, before being escorted to the ominous tower, DiCaprio asks: \\"Is it better to live the life of a monster or to die as a good man?\\"  His partner (actually, his psychiatrist) momentarily sees this as a sign of hope for the man who up to this point had denied his identity-- and the shrink appears about to delay DiCaprio's execution (or brain operation).  But its a cruel hoax that Scorsese plays, if ever so briefly, on his viewers.  Reality is not so easily and quickly attained--all the more so in the virtual world, or simulacrum, that is the 21st century.  DiCaprio's character opts out, choosing to undergo the lobotomy rather than carry the knowledge of his guilt.<br /><br />The movie frequently shows its seams, with lots of phony studio shots (no doubt intentional-reminiscent of many B films); in fact, there's enough apparent shoddiness and even amateurism to cause the film to look careless and hasty, much as was Adrian Lyne's \\"Jacob's Ladder\\"--perhaps the reason that both of these worthy films did not come up for serious academy award consideration.  Maybe Scorcese will try for an improved remake, or a sequel that's more willing to confront our strange new world, bringing us face to face with a bizarre digital reality that even the anachronistic postmodernists have yet to catch up with.<br /><br />[Later: The film is less open, ambiguous, complex that I had first imagined.  Like its primary predecessor, \\"The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari,\\" we are left to decide whether Teddy Daniels is better off living in delusion and denying his responsibility for the deaths of his wife and three children (my initial impression); or whether he deserves to be \\"cured\\" and released into \\"normal\\" society (a self-awareness that the evidence in the last scene suggests that, contrary to the conclusion drawn by his psychiatrist, he has attained).  But, in fact, Teddy chooses a 3rd option: indeed, he has attained self-knowledge but does not want to live with the memory of his heinous crimes.  Instead, he \\"chooses\\" his own punishment--and by dying a good man, he does not have to live as a fully-conscious \\"mad man\\" in a society that will remain as mad as he once was.  Right or wrong, few of us would blame him for making that choice.]<br /><br />[Later: This is a film I would consider for use in a film or lit class (if the opportunity once again presented itself).  When given the option of presenting their own selections for the class, most students disappoint--most recently, all we saw were post-\\"Matrix\\" movies that seemed to clone themselves over and over again--gimmicks and special-effects that, moreover, were \\"about\\" nothing more than gimmicks and effects, along with the dream/reality device worn to death in pointless scripts. Even a cinematic masterpiece that uses illusion/reality to the end of the most powerful \\"liebestod\\" outside of Wagner's \\"Tristan und Isolde\\"--Hitchcock's \\"Vertigo\\"--seemed incapable of raising the filmic literacy of no more than1-2 members in a class of 30. \\"Higher education,\\" insofar as the humanities are concerned, is an abysmal failure.

B009FZHYKU|5.0|I just love it you just have to see it your self. something different than what is on old tv
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This game is definitely a good way to occupy your time!  the bright colors make it fun to llay and easy to learn
B009GEAPYW|1.0|Once I realized that this movie was a ridiculous animation I immediately stopped watching it. I would rather lose 3.99 than waste my time. The movie should have been clearly labelled &#34;animated&#34;; instead they lure viewers in by obscuring this fact. As the saying goes, &#34;Let the buyer beware&#34;.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|As always, a very well written mystery by Grisham.  I learned quite a bit about the justice system while reading this very fine mystery.
B000FC1MM8|4.0|Harry Bosch is always a good read! He is the kind of detective who plods along doing things his way and getting the job done.<br />HT Owen
B00006ADD5|5.0|This is an epic film. Its small intimate story cast across a giant spectrum landscape. It took two years to make. This type of film can't be made anymore because of the cost. The story is mostly true.
B007N8RULO|5.0|I love this game. It is easy to use and I could play it for hours. I could do without the ads but at least you can skip them in this game.
B001VIMCW4|4.0|If you like action movies you will love this. Very good. Daniel Craig is the best Bond since Connery. Well executed
B001TXWJ4M|5.0|This is hands down one of the best series ever.  Brian Cranston as Walter White is brilliant.  The cinematography is beautiful and the writing is superb.  I highly recommend.
0062127241|1.0|There are many lengthy reviews here. So allow me to write a very brief one for fans of The Who and Townshend's solo work.<br /><br />Here goes: this book contains more information about Pete's yachts than it does about the writing and making of The Who By Numbers, Who Came First, All the Best Cowboys Have Chinese Eyes, Rough Mix, and (The Who Sings) My Generation - COMBINED. Yes, you read that right. I'm not exaggerating<br /><br />So what, then, is this book aboout? Mostly it's a book about Pete's real estate, yachts, and mistreatment of his wife. I can't recommend this to Who fans. And if they're not interested, then who would be?<br /><br />A mistake for him to write, a mistake for a Who fan to read.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Awesome start to finish. The rest of the series should be great. I Plan to start book two as soon as possible.
B009AP2G26|5.0|Thank you Thank you for having this available for viewing - being an internet only viewer, I was forced to wait 8 days until Amazon came along to make my week.  :)
B001RIY4WE|5.0|What can I say, this 1991 movie came out in Blu-Ray much better than Total Recall (1989).<br /><br />Not sure why but the transfer is much cleaner.<br /><br />Lots of extras and just a fun movie.  Best of the Terminator series.<br /><br />Arthur Henrick, Sunnyvale, California  Nov 2012
B006ZZC3D6|5.0|Be sure you have the time to spare  ;)<br />It will keep you going to the next level or bust
B007D2XSW0|5.0|loaded this on my new kindle and I love it.  easy to use and great instruction system.  recommend<br />I reallylike the many options available.  It would be nice to have a infrared filter.
B004ADH1RI|5.0|I would reccomend this movie, just good old fun. Had this movie in VHS format liked so much I bought DVD version.
B000VZUT64|5.0|Seems like no collection would be complete without this classic from the 70s. Robin Trower at his finest and happy to have this back in my collection.
B00973902K|5.0|What can I say, the song is so popular and my kids ask me to buy it! Keep them occupied on a 5 hour drive.
B009P5S11G|5.0|I will love Rihanna regardless how well received her cds are..but i'm happy to say she put out another winner. I love almost every song on this album...\\"Diamonds, No Love Allowed and Lost In Paradise\\" are currently my personal faves. I will be wearin out this cd for sure. She's the best..Go RiRi
B009AZZEU2|4.0|This is a good CD.  Some songs are memorable...others, not so much.  Just another typcial Soundgarden album.  The sound production is on par with \\"Down on the Upside\\" and the vocals & instruments sound crisp & clear.  Great editing....unlike Metallica's newest album.  Dear lord.....<br /><br />Overall a good CD for the avid Soundgarden fan!  I picked up the deluxe version that has 5 demo songs of songs that are already on the CD, so that is kind of dumb to hear the same song twice on the album.  The demo's sound just like the actual songs without all the artsy-fartsy mixing, but it's not worth the extra $4-$6 for the \\"Deluxe\\" version, I can tell you that!<br /><br />Best song (I think) is \\"Rowing\\" and \\"Bones of Birds\\".....two good breakup songs, for people trying to mend a broken heart.  Least favorite song is \\"Taree\\"....this is just your typcial song that has no creativity what-so-ever.<br /><br />But like I said, don't take my opinion...pick up a copy and support your aging Seattle bands in the 21st century!!!  *smiles*
B009WO7NQO|5.0|Challenging levels, cool graphics, fun tricks for the birds! Just really really cool. I'm not even very far along and I already hope there are lots of levels because I think I could play it forever.
B004QKNXIQ|5.0|This was our first time renting from amazon instant video.  We downloaded and watched the movie on our ipad.  I was very impressed at the quality of picture.  We need to get speakers for our ipad though.  our car was too loud and it was hard to hear.  I would definitely rent from amazon again.
B009D5VNLS|3.0|I don't have young children and my seventeen year old would not watch with me. It's great for young children.
B002NZTZ8S|4.0|Kids love it and the songs aren't bad.  The effects are great. A great movie to sit and watch with the kids.
B0072GPPNC|2.0|This film makes for a great drama, but the World War I backdrop is there simply to give a platform for the story. The advertising of this movie as a WWI drama is misleading. The WWI action you see in the trailer is pretty much the entirety of what you'll see in the movie. What war scenes are actually in the film are unrealistic and romanticized. The title of this film would more accurately be &#34;Horse Which Happens to Be In a War On Occasion&#34;.
0671449028|4.0|It's cool.  It rhymes.  The meter's good.  It's cute and has animals in it and talks about going to sleep, which is probably what I should do.
B005LAII94|3.0|This Oliver Stone's latest directorial effort is a drug cartel/caper fantasy headlined by 3 attractive young stars and other veteran seasoned actors.  The film is based on a book which seems to have lifted the premises of Francois Truffaut's 'Jules & Jim' but transported the trio to the colorful Southern California drug world.  Stone and 2 other writer cooked up this rambling script (overlong at 2 hr 11 mins .  90 mins maybe more desirable but the film makers will not have so many things throw at you) seemingly had a good time and possibly under the influence as well while writing and directing the film(watch out for the shot of Stone dancing in the clouds with Lively).  Unfortunately this viewer did not share their enthusiasm.  The main problems are the weak and unfocused story/screenplay, superficial characterizations and some bad casting(Selma Hayek) and unusual but unsatisfactory ending.  Of the 3 main characters, Taylor Kitsch was supposed to be the veteran war killing machine but with the exception of his first sex scene, his rage seemed to disappear altogether right afterwards.  Blake Lively worked hard and might be the only female actor who kept her top on during violent sex.  Only Aaron Johnson managed to give a sensitive and intense performance throughout.  I believe it was his acting chops, rather than the script or direction. Credits must be given to John Travolta and Benicio Del Toro for giving us a couple of brilliant scenes together.<br />2 stars for the movie.  1 star for Travolta and Del Toro.
B007Y5IAV0|5.0|This album is the best Serj Tankian album to date. It's the closest to SOAD we can get. Every track is great, but I especially love Occupied Tears. It's amazing. Hope this helps. If you like SOAD or Serj, you'll love this album. It's Serj's best imo.
B00A6PD8RQ|4.0|Great to watch with your family or loved one.  The graphics are specatular. The movie doesn't drag along. Great buy!!!
B006LSZECO|5.0|Liked the style and constant twists. It was definitely worth the read and a great recommendation. Really keeps you on your toes.
B009NPM5Y2|1.0|....but if not, you won't.<br />Watching lip-synched remakes of classic rock and roll tracks was pretty revolting. Fact that they were allegedly sung by the the stars of the movie made it even worse. I will have a hard time listening to the real tracks without remembering how awful the Rock of Ages remakes were.<br />Rented it because my wife is a Glee fan. I think she'd give it 2 or 3 stars.
098555780X|5.0|Paracord Fusion Ties is a great book  very informative.<br />It is simple and not hard to follow. I will be buying book 2!
B003CSV7TK|5.0|I think this is the best version of this movie. Would recommend it to anyone and everyone who loves Christmas movies.
B000FC1HBY|5.0|Interesting story that keeps you wanting more. Tyrion and Arya's chapters are great. Book is better than season 2 of the show (which is good as well).
1419705849|5.0|My 10 year old nephew has loved every Diary of a Wimpy Kid book.  I'm sure this will not disappoint!
0399157565|3.0|I feel like Patricia Cornwell has turned into James Patterson and this book was rushed out for Christmas sales...she includes things that happened in past books...and the plots are starting to become similar....<br /><br />It's very wordy ...very wordy.  Many scientific pages I just glanced at that could have been left out.<br /><br />The old characters surround her....and as usual her niece Lucy is annoying and secretive and just a real pain in the butt.<br /><br />I miss the early books...these last few are just not the same old classic Scarpetta that we all know and loved.
B007FEFLTO|4.0|This continues Follet's triilogy following several families over several generations from pre-WW I on.  It's a great way to enjoyably review and refresh your understanding of world history during the 20th Century.
B004ZZS4CC|5.0|Jaycee Dugard is an unbelievable and strong woman. This book is an incredible story. I could not put it down. Words can't describe how she dealt with her ordeal for so many years. She is truly an amazing woman and mother. A must read book!
B005K17RU0|5.0|it does the job &amp; free. works for me. it is accurate and easy to use . just select your city.
B008HK3XU4|4.0|I really like the case but when I got it it has a strong leather/something smell.  The smell did go away after a few days of being out of the box.
B00913P6G0|5.0|I don't think there's any question Good Kid m.A.A.d City is the best hip hop/rap album of 2012. The album (that will be a classic) has a common theme and style with every single song from the first to the last. It has good features and several interesting dialogue clips that give you a sense of Kendrick Lamar's life while growing up in Compton. Money Trees is definitely my favorite song off the album... ya bish!
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|This book is what we've been waiting for. After reading Riordan's other books about these Greek and Roman Demigods, you'll have to read this one. The action starts in Mark of Athena right from the very beginning and continues throughout the book.
030759565X|5.0|I've been following smitten kitchen for a few years now and have made over 40+ of deb's recipes from her site with great success. I pre-ordered this cookbook and have been having so much fun cooking my way through it.<br /><br />So far I've made the following:<br />-gingersnap pumpkin tart (twice)<br />-deep dish apple pie<br />-ratatouille sub (three times)<br />-blueberry cornmeal cake<br /><br />I made the pumpkin cheesecake tart for thanksgiving and I thought it was delicious. The apple pie was seriously the best apple pie I've ever had - and I used a combination of golden delicious and granny smith. It was perfect. I added an extra 1/3 cup of sugar b/c i used granny smith as my \\"other\\" apple...and I felt the sweetness was perfect this way.<br /><br />Ratatouille is my favorite pixar movie and I was delighted to see it in the book. It was so much fun to make and so delicious. I made it once myself and the other time w/ my 11 year old niece. We had a blast making it and even more fun eating it on sourdough subs w/ melted provolone (didn't have baguettes or goat cheese on hand but it was delicious anyhow!).<br /><br />The blueberry cake tasted like the ideal blueberry muffin (in a square) and the texture, sweetness and delicious streusel topping were absolute perfection.<br /><br />Some of the reviewers complained that her intros to each recipe are too lengthy. Honestly, my favorite part of going through my cookbooks (other than cooking and eating) is reading each story behind the recipe. It helps me understand how she came up with it and why, so it's not just a hodgepodge of randomly selected recipes in her book....but there's a reason.<br /><br />She made a deep dish apple pie b/c one wasn't cutting it and two didn't look cool on the table, so she came up w/ a monstrous pie to satisfy everyone's cravings.

B009LK6JS2|4.0|Nice to have a mini flight sim to practice touch and gos when away from home.<br />This is one I would reccomend.
B009WUAK2M|5.0|Loved it. A real action movie where the bad guys what they deserve. What I found most interesting about the movie was the interaction and dialogue between the actors and not necessarily the action and shoot'em up scenes. I can't wait until #3...Let's take the political korrectness and sh-ve it. We'll be  guessing who will be in the next. Clint Eastwood, Harrison Ford. Possibly Kid Rock to do the music and make a cameo.
B0096HIEE2|5.0|This movie is so good and he dances soooooo good that I get the chills but its not just about the dancing, Its about what people go through in real life just to make money and also what people will do for someone else when they fall in love.
B0061JPYX2|5.0|Love her music its very relaxing, and or upbeat depending on your style.  I love it, great CD highly recommend.
0765367297|5.0|Hey I like it and that's all your going to get unless you have to put in more words which is rediculous!

B007TXN4TK|3.0|I havent got to play this alot but what I have done with it is great.  I have always wanted to play the piano and this helps me learn the keys and songs.
0547884591|5.0|This book is wonderful! The first thing I noticed about it was the size and weight of it, much larger than I expected. As I started to skim through it I could tell why. This book is filled with interesting and useful information. After interrupting my girlfriend's painting of her nails atleast 10 times while just reading the meta learning section she says to me, \\"That is a really long book for you to be telling me everything cool in it\\". This a book that you are going to want to read bit by bit, an experiment/practice what it teaches. Just reading this all the way through and not using any of the techniques is going to be a waste.
B001GH5LM8|5.0|From the the first track on \\"Shogun\\" Trivium holds nothing back. The very first track Kritsute Gomen and its defiant chorus \\"...I will never be what they want me to...\\" sets the furious tone for this my favorite Trivium album. With \\"Shogun\\" they have shown real depth in their musical vision that few metal bands have attained, especially so early on in their career. The vocals rip back and forth from anthem rich melodies to primal ferocity with ease. With song writing that ranges from the deeply personal to war cries against the injustice we face on a daily basis. The music on this album reminds me of a brutal blend you might get if you mix the all out ferocity of a band like Nevermore with the beauty and complexity of a band like Dream Theater. \\"Shogun\\" is an album I would definitely recommend to any metal fan that goes for the face melting heavy but also likes depth and melody in their blend of thrash.
B0042UEU8M|3.0|The movie had it's good moments but the premise was a litle strange and I kept hoping the story would get better.
B007MDB6L0|5.0|This was a gift for my great niece who turned 3 years old.  According to her mother, she watches this movies on a daily basis.
0880796863|5.0|Easy to read cards, but the book could have been larger print  for us older readers.  Other than that I would buy more
B00A0SQBDM|1.0|Dev...if your game is only a demo, then it should be noted in the product info. no where does it say that this is only a demo. Uninstalled and forgotten.
B008Z9YLV2|5.0|I loved this book! It was very entertaining, could not put it down! That's why I gave it 5 stars! After reading it I went out and rented the movie! It was interesting to see the characters I read about in the movie. I would recommend it to anyone that loves a good action filled book with a lot of other dynamics mixed in.ie romance, survival tactics, politics, etc. it was great!
B00A6PD9I4|3.0|This was an overall good movie but not one of Pixar's best movies.  The story itself felt lacking. Its no Toy Story.
B0083SBMBM|5.0|This move is awesome. Action packed. I hadn't seen thor or captain america, but after seeing the advengers, I hiked to the library and rented them too which were good also. I recommend seeing thor, captain america, the incredible hulk and iron man first to give a better understanding. But even if you hadn't seen them, this movie still hold it's ground as a great movie. Get it!
B003ASLJQS|5.0|Music by Clint and Kyle Eastwood - who knew? Haunting musical editor Craig Pettigrew.  I had missed this the first time around and was overwhelmed by this film.  Two oscars say it all.
B000GCFY0I|5.0|I would recommend this book to anyone and everyone! Especially if you are a fan of young adult fiction books. It is about Tally Youngblood who at first sets out to betray her friend, but changes her mind and tries to save her instead. This is a series, and if you read the first one you have to read the rest! I cannot wait to read the next book!
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|Lots of fun. I like this game better than agry birds. a good amount of levels for the free edition.
B0083P1QUM|4.0|I have to admit I love (and have read) almost all of her books---especially the Scarpetta series.  this is really one of the better ones but a little too technical some times.  I needed the dictionary too often----and not the one on Kindle.  Unfortunately, it is slow developing and then speeds through the ending.
B000FC2L1E|5.0|Left me wanting to read the next book and looking forward to more interesting adventures. Should I need to see anything more?
B009ZXT4BY|5.0|I think its a good game its like minecraft but cheaper so my opinion of this game is good also I recommend getting the fool version
B007FC3AAI|5.0|This was a great deal!  The DVD is in great shape and came before it was expected to. I would do business with these folks again.
B00314VYNE|5.0|Great value. Great shape! Shipped fast. And good  price for this toy. My daughter was very excited. I recommend it!
B009RI4FRU|5.0|My favorite Wes Anderson movie. Loved the characters, the setting, and the 2 kids were great<br />My favorite Movie of last summer
B007N5YY2K|5.0|Amazons desperate begging for reviews is sad to say the least. the products are good,generally what they say they are.
B0086700CM|3.0|It's repetitive. After you get everything it's kind of pointless to keep trying, not very motivating. Four more words here.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|does what need and more. i use it for balancing my books and also for college. i enjoy this app emmensely and im sure you will to
B004IWF64Q|5.0|I loved this as much as the first one. In the first one it showed The New World and in this movie it showed England. It is probably a good movie for the family.
B0055B7IPE|5.0|Amazons desperate begging for reviews is sad to say the least. the products are good,generally what they say they are.
B0083SBJXS|4.0|The story and relationships make this movie.  It's not just another action movie with big explosions.  It has that, but it's more.  The Blu-Ray also has an option for a dual screen experience with your iPad, which sync's up movie details on the tablet about every 30 seconds.  Pretty nice addition.
B003073CTG|5.0|Anything Jimi's done is the greatest music in the world. Too bad he onlyy has a few years on this Earth.
B001H1SVO8|4.0|If Amazon would allow me to more easily view movies on my Android devices, I would probably give them five stars.
B009WUAK2M|5.0|No sex, no nudity, and mild language!  What a refreshing surprise. Leave it to Chuck Norris to show us again that those aren't needed to make a wonderful film!
B0098HJ11U|5.0|This is a woman who knows.......life, soul, music.  To see her live is to love her and appreciate her.  Once you see her perform, I think you understand her stylings in a more profound way.  Janis Joplin meets motown.  If you like bluesy, gutsy, pained singing, then Bettye is your gal.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|this is the most best calculater I ever had :).This is better than the other ones.This calculated is better because it shows the last muliplactoon problem.<br /><br />  from:Damien Martinez.<br />  to: the person who made this app .Thank u for this app this is my favorit app in the world<br />  p.s., GANGNAM STYLE. :-)
034580404X|5.0|Got these books in record time and loved the full series. Can't wait for the movie. I really liked the story line the other stuff was a little over the top and too frequent.
B0063IH60K|5.0|This is the old standby Solitaire. It's simple and quick to use. I have it installed on other handhelds (iPod, etc) but just added to new Acer Iconia A210 Tablet. Use it when waiting such as in Doctor's office, car repair shop, etc. No thinking involved. Just a time killer.
B00136RYXG|5.0|Nothing else needs to be said.  You either love her or you don't.  Give this powerful chic singer a go.
B0086700CM|4.0|Temple Run is a fun and addictive game. It has great visuals, and the sound affects are phenomenal! Save coins and buy better characters, power ups, speed increasers, and life savers. Need to pause your game? Go ahead! All ages can enjoy this game! So try it.
0316228532|3.0|I found the Casual Vacancy very hard to get into from the start. It was just okay.  So many characters to remember.
B002BJGYV2|5.0|I never watched Gilmore Girls on TV but by an accident I happened upon the series and now I am addicted.
B004QX07G4|1.0|I love Ellen and her show but this book was terrible, Dorey should have written it as that is how stupid it is, pure drivel.
0446585025|1.0|This book was a bunch of rambling. I love to watch her show, but the book was not funny. Big disapointment.
B005ZMTXMY|4.0|Watched with family and all enjoyed it. Great message, exciting for younger viewers, many tender moments. Would highly recommend for family movie night.
B009D5VNLS|5.0|A little heavy on the witchcraft... could have done without that. Beautiful story of the mother / daughter bond and how communication is an action that requires listening from both parties involved.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|wow!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!i love this story, i hope the zombies eat carl and the baby. or the baby turns and we get to see baby zombie.
B006KX3GXO|5.0|its awesome like you'll really like it you can change Colors  n write on the pic n its just really awesome
B009WO7NQO|1.0|Why do people even play this game? Dude I buy free stuff unit stuff that costs $2.99. I can find better stuff that is Free! Angry Birds is not a fun game. Its not like you can play it forever without getting bore but Temple Run I can play that game for a long time.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I really like the 3rd season. I would recomend this series to anyone, but you have to watch it from the beginning.
B004SDEP38|3.0|Use this on my Android, but honestly, how often do you need to look at an Office document on your phone and if you are looking for portable document solutions, Google Docs/Google Drive seems to work better for me anyway.
B004ZZS4CC|5.0|I will say I would not normally take the time to review a book, but I found this one to be so inspiring. I could not put it down. Very well written, had me crying at one point and laughing and cheering her on at the end. What an incredible woman she has become! Thank you Jaycee for sharing your story.
B009329Y30|2.0|I wanted to like this one, but there just was not enough there.  This is not a bad movie, understand.  It is, in fact, a very conventional and (I have to say it) stereotypical chick flick.  Impossibly gorgeous Taylor Schilling is recently divorced from a county Sheriff, and has an impossibly cute 8 year old son.  Incredibly handsome Zac Efron is a Marine returning home after three deployments who seeks her out based upon a picture of her that he kept as a lucky talisman in combat. (Long story, but the film does tell it.)  Guys will hope for the conclusive showdown between the Marine and the Sheriff, but, well, more would be telling.  Suffice to say that this film is an easy way to pass 101 minutes, but that is about it.<br /><br />Taylor Schilling is very, very, easy on the eyes.  By the way, the wise old grandmother (Ellie, played by Blythe Danner) is pretty easy on the eyes too.<br /><br />If you want a non-violent chick flick, this one is for you.  RJB.
B007SSEBCU|3.0|The movie was okay; the movie was a  little slow and seemed to drag on and on and on.  A lot of flash backs.  Instead of focusing on Margaret Thatchers life after her role as prime minister, I would have liked for the movie to focus more on what the prime minister did during her tenure as prime minister.
B004SJ3AXI|2.0|This comes with no instructions on how to play. I may be the last person to try this game, but it is no good if you can't figure out what to do with it.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|Excellent Utility. Welcome app for Kindle fire.<br />Used always upon turning on my FIRE. checks all apps power consumption.<br />A must buy.
B005LAIIFS|5.0|I would recommend it for anyone of any age! It was entertaining, funny, and very memorable. Also, they artwork and animation was impossibly fantastic.
B004S699LI|5.0|Collectors item. Received in good and timely fashion. Will be always keen to purchase more in the very near future
B003DWC6IQ|4.0|I am not a fan of court room dramas, but after a slow start the book kept me reading until the early hours of the morning.<br />A typical Jeffrey Archer book, in line with most of his others.
B009IJJB8G|4.0|Similar to the other shows this season. Easy to watch and the HD quality is good. Show is very similar to The Mentalist.
B000002MFE|5.0|I always loved this CD. When it was time to get it for my own collection--Amazon seemed the way to go.
B000NQRE1E|5.0|Good quality and received in good and timely fashion. Will be to keen purchase more titles in the very near future
B009VSW15Y|2.0|first of all it costs $1.99 to purchase an app needed to even use the camera.  Why put a camera on the kindle if you need to buy an app to use it? the quality isn't that great either!
B002SF9YNO|5.0|I highly recommend this DVD.  A wonderful job of directing and acting!  It lets you think and absorb.  A must see,
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Solid in every way.  Easy to use, clear controls, and covers the basics splendidly.  A great tool that meets it intended purpose.
B005OK725M|5.0|Good quality and received in good and timely fashion. Would be keen to purchase more in the very near future
B0086DBE62|5.0|[[VIDEOID:mo7TQ45M5L99DH]]See why I think this movie has something for everyone! Lots of good metaphors for life, some profound life lessons to be gleaned from this interesting remake of the Classic Snow White. Love the twists. [[ASIN:B0086DBE62 Mirror Mirror]] Watch it now!
B008Z9YLV2|5.0|Great movie, visually, and the acting, direction, screenplay and costumes were fantastic.  I have to admit, though, I have not read the books.  I would highly recommend this movie.
B009WO7NQO|2.0|Like most I am tired of paying then paying again. This game is not great and I think I am done with Angry Birds after this!
B004I1K430|4.0|This edition of \\"The King's Speech\\" was made in Canada and unfortunately leaves out most of the Special Features: The making of featurette ; Q&A with the director and the cast ; Speeches from the real King George VI and Lionel Logue highlights. This is a historical drama, rich in the history of the era, not to mention the winner of the Academy Award for Best Film, and anyone would want the additional features in order to enhance their appreciation of this amazing film. Was there any thinking involved when the decision was made to eliminate them? Adding insult to injury, this isn't even the version I ordered!  It was substituted, most likely by someone routinely filling an order in a factory. Perhaps a better question would be - why have it at all? I order hundreds of DVD's for a public library collection and I rarely have any problems with the service I receive from Amazon, but I do want to warn future buyers of this film to be careful of this version.
B0030IIZ56|5.0|My 2 year old asks to see Buzz and Woody nearly daily!  We all love this movie and I don't see us getting tired of it soon
0765365278|4.0|I'm looking forward to the other books in this series.  Very interesting story and interesting characters set in a well developed world.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|It is a great game for killing time and lots of fun.  It is challenging and there are lots of levels.  Awesome game!
B00633W614|4.0|&#34;The Sins of the Father&#34;  by Jeffrey Archer  - great continuation of the Harry Clifton saga.  I'm not finished yet, bu tam  enjoying every page!<br />Archer makes his characters live.
B001NLKT60|5.0|Larsson has written an admirable trilogy that leaves no lose ends. This book is captivating and will hold your breath until the very end.
1416955070|5.0|Clary is one tough chick, and the more she learns about herself, the tougher she gets. Simon is not the guy I want her, Clary, to get with with. Although, the guy I had picked, I get creeped out now thinking of them together.<br />Thanks Cassandra Clare for making that happen.... lol.... It's a good thing though.<br />You'll love Jace and his bad-boy attitude, but my favorite character is Church. Ironically, I once had a Church of my own. (You'll have to read the book to learn about who Church is.) I found that kinda neat anyway.<br />Definitely a cool book and one I think a lot, no, a gazillion people will love.<br />Even better, it's being made into a film. Can't wait to see this one.... man, I best get reading City of Ashes.....
B007FEFLTO|5.0|It gave me a different view of what it was the worst war ever. How Ken plays with the different characters is a master piece.
0547884591|5.0|I am a big Tim Ferriss fan. He has changed my life and countless other's and for that I am grateful. Tim is a giver. I offered to help him out when he asked for help for his last book The 4-Body. He ended up not needing my help. And then out of the blue I get an email from his assistant stating that just because I had offered to help, he was going to send me the book. Well, he sent me 2 of them! Tim is just like that. Full of surprises and generous to a fault.    I bought both the Kindle version of this book and the Hard copy. The price is so reasonable that I could not resist. I have already encountered gems of knowledge and insight for the use of D-Ribose which I love as a supplement. And have now found out it can be used in the cooking of meat to give the meat an unparalleled \\"meaty\\" flavor! Who would have known?    I know I am going to be learning sooooo much from this book. With the Holiday weekend behind me, I'm diving in big time this week in reading it. I really hope you don't miss out on this great book in both versions of print and also make sure and read his other two books and follow him on Twitter and on his blog which is a great resource to Learn anything and Live the Good life. [...]
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|The third and last book of Stig Larsson. Its impeccable, ties all lose ends. The story is rapturing and captivating.
B009NQKXYK|5.0|Very entertaining! Ridle Scott does it again with his Alien saga. I love his movies! Must watch if u love sci-fis.
B004SVM7BW|5.0|I really have been happy with this PDF reader.  I have been putting it to good use each day.  Like that I can highlight what I want.  Can do a number a great things with this PDF reader.
B002BI6SMI|5.0|This movie was great!!! I highly recommend it. It is extremely suspenseful and exciting! Much better than the sequel was.
1401216676|4.0|As for the deluxe edition - there probably isn't too much you are missing out on in the regular edition apart from a hardcover and a few extra pages. If it's cheaper and you aren't the biggest fan then just go with the regular edition.
B007NYPWS6|3.0|I was surprised that the video quality was fuzzy and poor. It was disappointing especially since we purchased the video from Amazon instead of renting it. I expected a better quality picture from Amazon.
B007FIY3VW|1.0|Not happy with this at all, will not work the way I was thinking.  To basic of a program, not what I am looking.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|Great game, very addicting, whole family loves it. This is my new favorite game to play. Love that it is free.
B008IJT0CE|1.0|In the pictures it shows that this app has &quot;82 relaxing sounds&quot; and in the description it says 36. The test drive has more sounds than the app that I bought does. Am I missing something? I would really like to have all the sounds to this &quot;premium&quot; version that I paid for.
B002APU580|5.0|I am a hopeless romantic person. I love a good love story and Pride & Prejudice is one of my favorite.
B003TOMAPC|5.0|you dont have to be a superhero/comic book fan to enjoy, im not snd i love the movie, great story great cast hopefully it will start some promising careers
B0074MZSWW|4.0|like many, I agree the 1st cut, Hold On, is the best. Lots of other good stuff. The band, vocals and material seem to draw from various 60s sources: motown, the stones, etc. great stuff.
B002SJKWZ4|5.0|I bought this as a gift for my Best Friend when he opened it and started to play with it the smile on his face was PRICELESS. you don't even need to program it for a TV just practicing with the wand and the instruction chart it a blast. but when you do set it to a TV a flick of your wrist or a turn to the left and you are the couch commanding Wizened. showing off to all your friends how you hold the power to watch all your favorite shows. its one of the simplest and most fun things my friend or I have played with in a while.
B0083ZBW2Y|5.0|Last read when I was 16.  Now I'm 60 and still enjoy reading this classic.  London does an incredible job portaying Buck, who is an incrediblely powerful dog.
1936608618|5.0|Wow -- it is rare for me to be completely blown away by any \\"resource\\" book.  whether it is sports related , related to work, parenting or anything else a resource of any kind usually has its limits.  It is rare to find a \\"one stop shop\\" for anything in which you are interested.  Well for those interested in being a better athlete; or interested in having more power; or interested in having more speed; or interested in having more endurance  ... or flexibility .. or better nutrition ... or technique or just about anything related to athletic movement there finally is a true \\"one stop shop\\".<br /><br />It is no secret I am a Huge Fan of Brian MacKenzie and Doug Katona's work with CrossFit Endurance.  I figured I was going to like Brian's new book but I also figured it would have its limitations -- how could a BOOK about endurance sports really be a helpful \\"how to\\" book?  Sure it could discuss theory but how practical could it be ?<br /><br />VERY!<br /><br />Brian MacKenzie, along with his CrossFit Endurance Co founders long ago broke the mold of traditional endurance training but now he has broken the mold of  training resources.  In his new book \\"Power, Speed, Endurance -- A Skill Based Approach To Endurance Training\\" Brian has provided in one book nearly everything you need to know in order to improve your fitness and reach your endurance goals.  Whether you are a beginner or an experienced ultra-marathoner Brian has delivered for you.  If you are an athlete or coaching athletes you cannot afford NOT to have this tool in your tool box!<br /><br />It seems to me the money spent on this book will paid back many times.  It gives practical advice and guidance in a manner that is easy to understand.  Its photographic demonstrations are painstakingly detailed and deliver the teaching point every time.  Many questions on technique ( run technique, swim technique, row technique, cycling technique, lifting technique etc) you could have for a coach are answered in this book.  I suppose as an Endurance Coach I should be grateful it is not interactive or we all could be out of gig.<br /><br />Actually what I am grateful for is the fact that now I have even more insight into the talented coaching soul of Brian MacKenzie.  The book is conversational and easy to follow.  It can be read cover to cover or just by using the index to find the answer to your particular question.  It is like having instant access to the wealth of personal experience and experimentation done over the years by the founders of CrossFit Endurance. You also  get to learn directly from Kelly Starrett directly with regard to mobility and flexibility.<br /><br />This book is a must have, a must read and a must read again.  Keep it close, refer to it often and you will be on your way to better physical fitness and improved power, speed and endurance.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|Reminds me of what arcades use to be. Refresh time is quick. It's fun just for a short game or a long game.
1436196329|5.0|Most things I Review I say yep or nope. So I’m short about 19 0r so words for your review.
B003XVYLDU|2.0|Not a fan.  I read this a long time ago and forgot how disjointed it is.  Vonnegut does not hold up very well.
B007SGLZP8|2.0|I was highly disappointed with &#34;The Racketeer.  It is, without a doubt, the only John Grisham book I felt should not have been written.  Muddling through page after page of tripe to end the last few pages with something interesting does not make for a satisfying read.
075669812X|5.0|My son loves Ninjago so scours Amazon for toys and books that are not too pricey.  He came across this and we decided to order it for him.  As with everything we buy from Amazon we got it within a few days time.  He hasn't put the book down and really likes the Lego Ninjago guy that comes with it.  Him and his friends make up their own Ninjago games so he said that the Character Encyclopedia has come in very handy.

B000JMKTLO|5.0|Hard to believe this was a first novel. Extremely well written and very gripping. This author has a fascinating way of allowing a story to unfold.
B007W8S2MG|5.0|I did not buy the game off amazon however I just beat it today and felt the need to make a review of it. First off the overall gameplay is solid and enjoyable. The \\"social links\\" that you will unlock throughout the game are original and memorable. The game lasts about 40 hours on average and has a new game plus option after you have beaten it. I highly recommend this game to anyone, especially JRPG fans. Now then for those of you who have played the original Persona 4 I would like to list a few major improvements and changes the Golden has made.<br />1. Two new interesting social links (Aeon and Jester)<br />2. An extra month to bring up social links<br />3. At least one new dungeon<br />4. Two new areas to explore<br />4. New persona fusions<br />5. Two new trips! One to the beach and one to a ski resort<br />These are just a few changes that come to mind at the moment I hope it helps.

B009IF82SK|5.0|Watch it over and over. Look forward to new episodes and the re-runs.<br />The streaming works better now then a few months ago.
B009TZ7WDK|5.0|Absolutely fantastic. These are some of the beautiful young voices around today. And that says a lot. I have been listening to this album on repeat ever since I bought it

B00A6PD9I4|3.0|When saw it's trailer, I had lot of expectation from this movie. But it just simply turned down the expectations. Story is not so great, just simple fairy tale story. Not WOW factor as well. Going with three star because graphic is good.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|i love this app because i know how much battery life i have before it dies instead of it shuting off on me.

0545101425|4.0|The plot is less believable than 1 & 2 but once you are hooked on the characters you have no choice but to read this final book. The ending is not so good though. Joan of Arc ends up as a housewife.
B004ADH1RI|4.0|I remember this one from when I was younger. I think this is a great classic movie to share with the younger generation.
B004EK926K|4.0|this is one of our favorite movies! however the amazon instant streaming video quality was poor. we watched the movie twice and both times there was multiple pauses. we have a very high speed internet and have very few issues with netflix video streaming.

0545091020|5.0|Yes there is a movie, but the book is better. The movie doesn't do this story justice. There are a lot of differences some good some not so good, but overall the book wins out. Once you<br />read this one you will go onto the next two without further consideration.
B009JZTOG8|5.0|I'm completely hooked on Once Upon a Time. I hope they're working on a 3rd season. I love it! I'm glad I was able to catch this episode on Amazon.

0739384171|5.0|Ok some of the food choices of this girl are a little odd, but the rest of the story will keep your mind busy. I highly recommend all three books. Read them in order and by the time you get to the third you won't want to stop. Lisbeth Salinder is quite a character.
B0087HT36U|5.0|great app, strongly recommend to any age group!<br />enjoy your time crashing all kind castles and structures, use rocks and flames or bombs and ropes. great time!!!
B002ZTQVGQ|5.0|My grandchildren love this movie.  They watched it all the time on tv.  I also enjoyed watching it.  Great story and characters.  Great animation.

0545101417|4.0|The second book in the trilogy was very well done. The reader is consistently excellent in her protrayal of the main characters. The plot is well done and kept my interest. Not quite as good as the first book.
0547884591|5.0|I love to read Tim's books, mostly because the are humerus and informative and partially because they are inspiring. I turn each page of his books building more and more confidence to attack my own life with as much vigor and strength.    This book combines Tim's learning technique, that can be used to learn anything and applies it to cooking. As usually he has some great short cuts to make cooking easier and more fun. I especially love the freezer technique for getting a better crust on our steaks.    This book is practical and truly does deliver on Tim's promise that anyone can learn to cook. He teaches knife skills, along with food preparation skills that are invaluable to the reader.    Tim also combines survival and outdoor cooking and \\"in the wild\\" skills that may come in handy some day.    The book is well written, informative and numerous at times and innovative at other times. I.e Tim cooks a whole meal in his hotel bathroom...    All Tim's books are a must read.    And Tim, if u read these I cld really use you for my documentary. It's about, me changing my life one pound at a time and finally following my dreams.    Check me out at: [...]    Thanks!

B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love God's word and by having easy access to this bible, has helped me spiritually as I gain knowledge of this written word. Reading the book of Psalms<br />in this electronic King James Version, simply encourages my soul as the Holy Ghost/Spirit orders my steps.

0547884591|5.0|If you want to master a skill, you will probably spend a few years learning and experiencing your new skill. So learning something for 4 years might be equivalent to 5% of your life! (if you live till 80 :-P ). But if you want to learn how to learn new skills (meta-learning), fast, with high standards, this is the book for you. Tim has a unique way of writing to keep you engaged while explaining the practicalities for fast implementation.<br /><br />Thank you Tim for this great book. Have been waiting nearly a year for it to come out, have the kindle edition, and will receive the hard copy in a few weeks here in Australia.<br /><br />Keep up the great job!<br />Cheers,<br />Miki.

B007FEFLTO|4.0|Long a fan of historical fiction, Follett does a nice job with a very interesting time.  Is it perfect?  Of course not.  It may not be as good as the first in the series, but a enjoyable, engaging read nonetheless.
B008ZOHCKE|4.0|I like this product b/c it allows me to type in some miscellaneous stuff that I need to remember.  Like making lists of shopping I need to do.  Reminding me of projects I have to take care of.  I can make a notebook about a special event and how I prepared and have that right @ my fingertips.  I can make a notebook of memories.  I can make a notebook on how I did on my daily workouts, what I did and how I felt about the result.  I needed something in my Kindle to be able to just type out and have handy my busy, daily schedule.  And this meets that need very nicely.

B008AITJ24|5.0|Even though the season is only 13 episodes long  due to Emily Deschanel's  pregancy all 13 are some of the best body of work bones has ever done.  Funny ,sweet ,thought provicking and with the same great gross bodies it provides an inside look at the charecters we have not had before I cant wait to get season 8 and see how they continue it.

0316172324|2.0|In theory, this book was good. It had a great concept, but it could have been explained in just a few chapters and not an entire book. The examples went on and on and on and on. I was bored with the book by the time I got to the end.
B009CG2YDE|5.0|cant say i was all that curious about this game, but grabbed it as the faotd yesterday and although it appears to be quite short in length at the 20 levels, at first, the depth of the levels is quite astonishing.  i would describe Velocispider as a sweet mix of space invaders, galaga, and the now &quot;classic&quot; android game Radiant.  game starts out easy enough but gets progressively harder, JUST LIKE ITS SUPPOSED TO.  with patience, timing, and a little luck, i got up to lvl 16 so far.  the game plays smooth as silk and this has got to be the first time ive had a great experience with tilt controls.  for those having trouble with tilting, heres my tip:  use both hands for extra balance of your device...makes a huge difference.  love the cutscenes when you start and restart the levels.  totally worth a buck and another win for the noodlecake folks...im a big fan of league of evil, trainyard and super stickman golf as well.

1439152802|3.0|I really wanted to like this book more than I did (I would give it a 3.5 if I could). I choose the book for a book club at work for our book to read this month. The Secret Keeper sounded like an intriguing mystery, which it was, but for some reason it seemed to drag on forever. I listened to the audio version (19+ hours) and the narrator did a fantastic job with very proper English accent and all.....made you feel like you were right there. I enjoyed the characters and the relationships between them and like how Morton told the story by switching between present day and then flashing back to events in the past from different characters perspectives then tying all the pieces/places together at the end. My big problem with the book is that a lot of the time I just wanted to get to the point of that chapter/scene, it was overly descriptive to the point of annoyance at times. I did love the ending, which I wasn't expecting to go quiet like it did but made the book even more worth the read.
B009NQKPUW|5.0|You will love this if you liked &#34;Alien&#34; and &#34;Aliens&#34;, and appreciate thoughtful and creative sci-fi movies. Also, it's one of the most beautiful movies I've seen in a long time.

B0042816YK|4.0|I like the general idea of the movie, but it would've been better if it had been with some unknown actress instead of a well-known one. In any case, if you're looking for a movie about self-discovery I have yet to find a better one despite this.

0547884591|5.0|First lets say i'm not a bad cook, in my circle of friends i'm the man with a spatula. That said I bought this book for the meta-learning explanation. In the first couple of recipes I learned more than my mom ever taught me (not  a cook).  The thing that really has me turning pages other than learning is the way everything is presented.  On taking book out of the box its hefty I flipped it in my hands checked the UPC and found three words that made me laugh so hard I couldn't wait to see what was inside.  No disappointment information in concise and well split up with engaging stories and side bars.  The humor is something that takes it next level it comes across genuine and subtle at times then he shows you a picture of his dog.  The way everything is explained seems like its coming from that one really smart friend that everybody loves to hang with.  I'm only halfway finished reading this book but with a dwindling stack yellow sticky notes I look forward to finishing it then enacting a bunch of new skills.  If you do end up buying this book you will learn something I cant guarantee what but something I promise.
B001QK91TY|5.0|I selected this DVD following an enthusiastic reference to it in an article in the NYTimes  or perhaps  it was the New Yorker.<br />I watched it with my 28 year old daughter and we both loved it.

B0061S073A|5.0|This is an awesome app for the Kindle Fire original in my experience.

B004DLPXAO|1.0|Okay, I love my Kindle apps on the other computers, on my HP Touchpad. I wasn't concerned about information being divulged, since I was already a regular Amazon customer.<br /><br />Then, I got Windows 8. I'm tired of the manipulation.<br /><br />I can't do this, or I'm only able to 'that' if and when I choose to sign up for a new Microsoft account or give my old email address, with the understanding that everyone connected with have permission to suck up all my information, whether here at Amazon.com, or my email address (and don't tell me it's not happening, okay? Every dam time I go to my mailbox I'm hit with ads of something I \\"browsed.\\" At first, I thought it was renegade malware,...it is malware.. YOURS.<br /><br />And now I'm supposed to just keep giving away my info, just because you're connected with Microsoft? Like I said, I'm not naïve. I know any and all info I cared about was collected more than six years ago, and no doubt is being updated even as I type this, but I am not going through this anymore.<br /><br />Yes, I realize that at some point, there'll be no way around it, but hopefully I'll have created a better network for gathering information, purchases, - HELL!~ I'LL VISIT A BOOKSTORE FIRST!- and then I'll simply uninstall all this BS called \\"progress\\" and spend the rest of my life being paranoid that corporations like you and Microsoft are using my television to watch me watching television! ROFL<br /><br />I'm serious. You guys are way too intrusive, and to sit here and entice me with  the wonderfulness of your product, only to reel me in and let me know that I can't have it unless I give info to you?? UP YOURS!! And no, I won't get a fake email address. I'm done.<br />OH, btw, Microsoft, if you keep this crap up, you're going to find more and more people gravitating towards free os systems like Linux and others, that is, until you find some way of getting into their system...YOU VIRUS.

B007NZQU72|1.0|I deleted this from my kindle halfway through reading it. I probably am a sensitive person, but the author has made up way too much for this book to be useful. The whole book was annoying with HSP being written repeatedly. I was sick of reading about HSPs being &#34;aroused&#34;. Couldn't she have picked a better word? And then getting into sexual abuse in childhood and repressed memories was an enormous red flag. This book is all speculative and based on no science. Save your money and read one of the excellent books about introverts.

B0085RZGYU|4.0|'Hell's Corner' has a pretty good overall plot but does have some flaws in the narrative. There's no man or woman that's just `the best in the world' at anything, including Oliver Stone at sixty and the woman-traitor, at forty five. Not even Mr. James Bond! The story is very complex because crime detection is most often quite a chore, and, in that sense, very believable. However, many action details are surprising and quite unrealistic. I don't know much about nanobots but The Camel Club member singlehandedly overpowering half a dozen `Russian' criminals armed with automated weapons? A man dunked in some god-awful smelling chemical, up to his waist, surviving the ordeal unaffected? The CIA's Murder Mountain's secret entrances and exits are also hard to swallow.<br />I read several Baldacci's novels in the past years and they did not have such problems. Still, it is a very suspenseful and good read, and makes one want to get to the end of the tale although the ending is implausible and thus, wacky. Leaving the overall good story with some of the the Camel Club characters dead, including the woman-traitor, would be a lot better...<br /><br />Steven Nedelton<br />Author of The Raven Affair
0307744434|4.0|This story is oddly riveting though I suspect it may be hard to sufficiently convey in words why to those who haven't read it.  Right from the opening sentences you can sense something magical is happening when a circus arrives with no warning...no notices, no advertising, no set-up, etc....  It just exists, or as the author notes: \\"It is simply there, when yesterday it was not.\\"  The blurb on the book jacket would lead you to believe this is a story about a competition, and maybe a love story at that, but that's a bit misleading.  Yes, the story centers around two children who are positioned by their illusionist fathers to compete with each other, even though they aren't initially aware what the competition is, who their competitor is, where or when the competition will take place or the rules to follow that will lead them to the ending (of course \\"winning\\" is just as undefined as everything else).  This book, though, is about much more than that.<br /><br />The circus plays a central role in the competition and it appears and disappears magically, offering up an intriguing cast of characters, some who work directly or indirectly with the circus and others who are so fascinated by it that it becomes their life obsession to follow it city by city as it reappears.  I won't delve into too many details as other reviewers have done that and also I don't want to provide any spoilers but the author paints a wonderful picture of a circus that relies on real magic, even as the true magicians present themselves as grand \\"illusionists\\" or stage magicians to satisfy the crowds.<br /><br />I particularly liked how the author intertwined stories causing a jump in timelines from chapter to chapter. It definitely requires the reader to keep track of the months and years as stated in the chapter titles but even as I did so I found it easy to get lost in the time jumps and on more than one occasion I found myself going back to clarify the timeline of a new chapter.<br /><br />I enjoyed this novel much more than I'd expected though I have to admit the ending left me a bit disappointed. I had another idea of how things would play out but I'm certain other readers were drawn to their own conclusions as the story came to a close.  I'd give this novel a higher rating but it's not for everyone. But if you're looking for a well-written story with captivating plots that makes you pay attention and challenges you at the same time, and you enjoy just enough fantasy to make an improbable story seem possible, then I think you'll enjoy this one.

B0071XO8RA|4.0|i bought this book on a whim the whole omnibus and at first thought another bad purchase. much to my surprize i got hooked and had to keep reading ...fast....needed to know how it was going to go. i am so glad i bought it. nice work mr. howey
B00A6PD9I4|3.0|A girl with wild hair, being adventurous, defying custom and owning a bow; what's not to like about this story, right?  Well, that's what I thought going in.  I had heard quite a bit about this movie and decided I should probably watch it.  It was ok, but it certainly didn't make me use up that whole box of tissues like most Pixar movies do (the first five minutes of UP anyone?).<br /><br />Merida is a young princess growing up in the woodlands of Scotland.  Her mother tries to teach her to be the perfect lady, but Merida would rather be out with her horse Angus, shooting arrows at targets and having adventures in the woods.  When it comes time for three suitors to compete for her hand, Merida decides she'll have none of it and comes in contact with a witch who promises to help her change her mother so she won't have to go through with the marriage.  The problem is, it changes her mom a little too much, and into something that her dad is not very fond of.  And only Merida can fix the problem.<br /><br />Ok, this might be a spoiler of sorts, but I kind of think Merida is a bit of a sociopath.  Take the potion, her mother is doubled over in pain and instead of thinking that maybe she poisoned her and she should get help, Merida is more concerned on if her mother's changed her mind about the marriage.  Then later on she watches her mother eat a few berries and then only tells her about the fact that they are poison and giggles while she sputters them out.  To me that is just a bit crazy.  Sure Merida has some good aspects, she's disciplined in her practice of the bow and arrow, will try to save her mom, and gets along well with her brothers.  But my goodness she can be quite scary as well.  Her mother I thought was very sweet in contrast.  Sure she doesn't want to listen to Merida's wishes, but really for that time in history she was doing what she was supposed to.  And Merida's dad was just comic relief sadly and not a figure you could learn from in this story; her brothers were the same type of characters.  I just couldn't really feel connected to any of the characters though.<br /><br />Voice Cast:<br />Kelly Macdonald: Merida<br />Emma Thompson: Queen Elinor<br />Billy Connolly: King Fergus<br />Julie Walters: Witch<br />Robbie Coltrane: Lord Dingwall<br />Kevin McKidd: Lord MacGuffin and son<br />Craig Ferguson: Lord Macintosh<br /><br />I think all of the voice cast did a good job.  The Scottish accent was certainly there and Macdonald had enough spunk for Merida.  Thompson as Elinor was calming although she could raise her voice if need be.  All the guys were the bumbling sort that the movie cast them as.<br /><br />The plot certainly wasn't what I expected it to be.  From the previews I thought Merida would be going on adventures and saving her country or something.  That was not the case.  She was just saving her mother from a mess that she had made and learning a little life lesson about not trying to change your own fate for selfish reason.  The problem is that the storyline was a bit convoluted and since this is a kid's movie, I'm not sure that younger or more immature kids could actually get any sort of lesson out of the movie.  There were some tender moments between Merida and her mom, and those were nicely done, but they were still offset by the times that Merida was a bit socio-pathic.  And quite frankly, the pace was so fast that it was a whirlwind trying to make anything of the life lessons the movie was teaching at times.  I wanted to like it, I really did, but while being a cute story about a mother-daughter relationship, it didn't use Merida to her full potential or keep my interest.  It should also be noted, that since this is a kid's movie, that there is some violence, especially towards a very scary bear.  It could be frightening for some.<br /><br />What was good was the animation.  I always like Pixar and its films and this was no different.  Fantastic use of color, especially in Merida's hair, and evenwithout watching it in 3D it was still wonderfully involving.  I especially liked the way they portrayed the Willow the Wisps.  The music too was very nice and I liked the Scottish theme it had.  They even had Bagpipes.  And \\"Touch the Sky\\" had that right element of adventure and bravery to its lyrics.<br /><br />An ok movie, it had the wonder of Pixar's animation and great music, but just a lackluster plot and characters that would merely rate average.  It won't stop me from watching Pixar, but I may have to go re-watch Up to regain my love of Pixar.<br /><br />Review by M. Reynard 2012without watching it in 3D it was still wonderfully involving.

B000THGPTE|5.0|OK Boys and Girls, Ladies and Gentlemen,<br />  I was drawn into Tull as I had a brother who is about 57 and I am 54, those were the days of all kinds of Great Music Coming from across the Pond, no kids not the Anaheim Pond but the Atlantic Pond where one runs into a group of Islands known as the U.K the land of Kings and Queens and the commoners which would include the Hot Musicians like Jethro Tull with its Iconic Lyrical Giant known as the phallic playing Ian Anderson, I can say that because that's what he told me.............And you must agree it brought something to Rock n Roll it never had and to this day is a rarety.<br />  To say it never got the credit due is an understatement but if I and the musicians listened to that shat they'd give up. This album is incredible especially if you were seeing these guys about every 6 months in stadium venues here in lovely San Diego County in Southern Cali. You heard the transitions of a group as the aged and I am sure were dealing with Ah Hmm where to we go from here? Seems every hot group we grew up with is losing members to over indulgences. I see it as the beginning of a back off from some of the harder Tull into this period which found Ian on stage with an Acoustic Guitar as other albums such as Songs from the Wood were being explored by the band. To Old to Rock and Roll to Young to Die sounds about how I feel at 54, just can't shut off that heavy metal no matter how much less hair I might have or how grey it might be. But it kicks and if you listen to it again and again if its your first time there is Martins incredible weaving through the songs on his Gibson just as in the previous years. And Ian's ability at song writing is pure genious and remains so to this day. &#34;It seems like everybody is on the stage and I am the only one sitting in the Audience.&#34; Different album but you say Tull and my mind goes to the Lyric or when I saw War Child indoors at the San Diego Sports Arena. Anyone downloading this it wasredone in 2007 but comes from the pure days of &#34;Sex Drugs and Rock n Roll.&#34; This is one album as many others in their line up that is a 5+ stars piece of work. Saw &#34;Ian Anderson does Jethro Tull Orchestral&#34; about 6 years ago and was transformed back to a much better time and place for an hour or so. Isn't MUSIC great? And all of the people coming out today just towing the same line Ian and the crew started all those years ago? Thanks B to Amazon who have made it possible to grab just about anything anytime and download it and be listening to it instantly. Yea I hate progress to a point and am feeling quite older these days but I can still close my eye's and see Jimmy Page and the Boys jammin at the S.D. Sports Arena my junior year of High School to this day the loudest Concert I have ever been to, my ears rang for a week.............Miss those guys terribly. Good to see Jason Bonham Jamming with Joe Bonamassa , Rock on!!!! What a Guitar Player did his mother ever imagine that is what she was to unleash on the world??<br />  Back to the album, CD, MP3 its getting hard to keep up with Jethro Tull will always be Giants and there collection of work timepieces of history we all owe a great debt of gratitude too. Peace Boys and Rock till you cannot walk.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I'm still learning the ropes somewhat, but find Pinterest very easy to navigate through and just a lot of fun!
B007UPNA6Y|3.0|Not Lee Child's best work, in my opinion.  I am a fan, and have read every Jack Reacher to date, but for the first time, found myself a trifle bored and restless with the storyline.  Still an enjoyable breather from (my) real life, but someone picking a Jack Reacher novel up for the first time might not be convinced to go back for more on the face of this one.
B004SD5GZ4|1.0|This was not what i expected. It did not work for me for some reason. I would have gave no stars, but you have to rate something.
B008Y212PI|5.0|I love these puzzles.  Makes you think and fun at the same time.  My only complaint is I wish there was an easy way to reset the puzzles once you finished them so you could play them again!
B009KHDT0C|2.0|I found myself wondering when the story was going to get going only to realize it was an hour in.  This was neither funny or dark. I couldn't even finish it. A disappointment and I am usually a super fan of Depp and Burton.
0785814531|5.0|Seriously, who doesn't love Poe?  :)
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This is a very useful app for the kindle.  It eliminates the need to carry a calculator and is so much easier to use then the calculator in my phone.
B001HBYHFA|5.0|I loved the series, and loved the movie. This is about the most interesting science fiction concept that I have found on TV or movies. I recommend it to anyone who loves speculative fiction.
B008JFC6F0|5.0|I maintain a healthy skepticism about contemporary alternative rock. I'm jaded to say the least with the relative decline in overrall quality of bands such as Radiohead, Flaming Lips, Modest Mouse etc. So when I was reading Pitchfork for new music to delve into, I happenstanced across this album and I figure I would give it a try.<br /><br />I mean my god.<br /><br />This album has been playing non-stop on my iPod. I am obsessed with the retro sounding psychedelic beats and the trippy but introspective and insightful lyricism. 10/10
B003L77GGK|5.0|I love this series!!  And in the grand scheme of things, this is a great season!
B008XCPO2Q|3.0|It was just an OK movie...nothing more nor nothing less.  Certainly not an Academy Award winner.  Mindless drivel at best.
B009CG2YDE|4.0|preaty cool game. could be better. I didn't like how you only got 3 lives but it was ok, I guess.
0316228532|2.0|I was so disappointed in this book, mainly becacause there is not one like able character. Rowling does not disappoint with her writing style.
B001FB4W0C|5.0|This is probably one of my favorite seasons in this series!  I can rewatch it's first episode, &#34;Lazarus Rising,&#34; everyday for the rest of my life and get tired of it.
B008GXHOFW|1.0|Well so far the Kindle Fire HD is not as good as my IPad. This is the 1st app I bought for my son to play it worked the first time and now it will not get past the opening intro. Please Amazon get with the software designer and have them fix the issues. Ive had my Fire HD for one week and besides the APPs that came with it the apps I have downloaded have been buggy. But that would something I could live with but my son who is a big Spider-man Man and is 5 doesnt understnd why his game doesnt work. TO THE SOFTWARE DESIGER: Please read all the negtive reviews you are getting and fix this or start GIVING REFUNDS.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|This app is so helpful on my Kindle FireHD: user friendly, beautiful graphics, and packed with information. I don't see how it could be any better!
B003JTHXN6|5.0|Delivering Happiness is probably one of the most inspiring books I have ever read-  second to The Fountainhead of course..<br />Love the format, tone, and meaning.
B000X5SPBI|5.0|I really do love the first couple of seasons in this series.  I don't know if it was because of its novelty, but regardless it is really good and this season is a great one in my opinion.
B000TGCR3S|5.0|I have loved this movie for years and decided to pick up the blu-ray copy. I was not disappointed at all. I won't go into a long, spoiler-riddled review of the movie - you can just look up reviews if you are that into it - but I will say that this story is both dark and light-hearted at the same time. It can be interpreted in many ways, all of them surely interesting. OH, and the soundtrack is superb. Highly recommended for pretty much everyone!
0761169253|5.0|You do not need to be an artist to get so much out of this. It can change your life and how you look at it.
B007ADIRDM|4.0|I bought this for my daughter and she loves it. However I do not like the price nor the small pieces.
B002JVWRAO|5.0|Great season in another great series.  If you haven't already started the series, I highly recommend that you do soon!
0375507256|2.0|I read this book because it was chosen in the book club I joined, and my friend was reading it at the time too. From reading the other reviews, you've gathered it's made up of 6 stories that are loosely connected. The problem I had with this book is I kept waiting for some ultimate climax that would tie all these stories together, which never came. What you see is what you get, nothing more. Maybe if I had known that going into the book, I would have a different opinion. If you choose to read it, know that it's just 6 stories and that's it; no surprise ending or complex theme.<br /><br />Another problem I had was remembering what happened in part 1 of each story. By the time you get to part 2 of the 4th story, you hardly remember where you left off in the 2nd or 3rd story. There's really no point in separating these stories, and I might add, part 2 of each story seem so rushed like the author was wanting to get it over with.<br /><br />I don't recommend this book, there's too many other good books out there to waste your time.
0684857219|5.0|Take it from someone who lost 40 lbs, then tacked on 15 lbs of muscle. This book is the tit$.
B008XG1X18|3.0|I'm not reviewing just this app, since there is nothing at all wrong . . . it is Pinterest I don't enjoy.  Yes, I know how it works; I just understand the reason for it.  I'm trying to stay on top of the most popular stuff in this electronic age, which is why I purchased this app, but Pinterest is still not something I enjoy.  Sorry.
B004QOB8SO|5.0|Thankfully, after such a long wait from season one to season two, this season turned out to be well worth the wait!  I really love it and Benedict Cumberbatch has quickly become my favorite Sherlock!
B00681UGFY|5.0|[[VIDEOID:mo7ENPTSB9F87]]As I used to love more other kind of animation movies artwork, like Nemo or Wall.e, I was shocked I like this book so much. Is really beautiful, full of landscapes and city backgrounds, character sketches as the old disney princesses tales. Each image is wonderful and book quality and book graphic design is perfect. Nothing bad to say, really worth it.
B009HV2JT8|5.0|Imaginative, action-packed rendering of an important era in history. Suspend belief and what you know about Lincoln and enjoy the interweaving of real-life events and vampire lore as applied to slavery and the Civil War. Great cinematography and special effects. I was pleasently surprised at how suspenseful and entertaining this film was. Then I saw that Tm burton was involved. That explains a lot. I would recommend this film to anybody who would like a creative, well filmed escape from reality.
B009M8E3K4|5.0|This is a must see for any Neil Young fan, shares more about the man behind the music, I agree with the Jedi master of Rock comment.
B005LAIH54|5.0|This movie is great!  Usually I am wary of sequels, but this one is done in a good way that doesn't undermine the first one but actually enhances it.
1557048630|3.0|I was a little dissapointed with this book. The Artwork is fantastic, but the edition of the book is not as good.<br />First thing I saw was the quality of the paper,the weight is very poor compared to books like this, any other of \\"the art of\\" is quite better. It has 160 pages and is 1/3 slimmer than \\"The art of Up\\" for example.<br /><br />And the edition: the order of the different sections, the composition of the images, the typography is a mess!. There are just a few sketches of night fury dragon, one of the main characters in the film, and it seems like they had to enlarge the images so much (one image per page) to fill all the space, really bad. And, I say again, it's really dissapointing to share on that way such fantastic Artwork.
B0091LF2QQ|5.0|Being a Fan of MIKA was the start, my idea of this singer is WHO is he chaneling...I hear overtones of Freddy Mercury and others. Being very serious this guy has a vocal range unlike many others and his stage performance will keep you on your feet.<br />A very VERY worth while purchase , but then again I have all his CD's released to date. Cause I am a FAN
B008KE3960|4.0|difficult and addictive. Grinding is required however due to many factors each run has its own struggle at different points than the last. The only thing I wish they had was a description of all the enemy vehicle types and their strengths and weekness.
B000R7GKQE|5.0|Ah, season 2.  Sometimes I go back and watch this season and smile because the guys are so young!  But nonetheless, it is a good season and a very good series.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Good brain teaser!  Had trouble putting it down.  Nice alternative to the card games once in a while.  I think you'll like it!
B0000VCZKM|5.0|Terrific movie with a great score and cast! Carol Burnett is perfect as Miss Hannigan! Outstanding entertainment for the whole family!
B00493E1GI|1.0|not like the book at all. book was insightfull.  movie was airheaded confusion.<br /> do yourself a favor and read the book first.
B002ZG977Y|5.0|I love this movie!  I can watch it repeatedly for hours!
B00AA7O22U|3.0|Lots of action but a little cheesy and predictable.  It was worth the 3.99, but I won't be buying it.
B001KOFH2G|1.0|Totally violent and graphic.  With Joss Whelen's sense of humor.  All the men in the family loved it. But I just couldn't handle it
B00006J9OT|5.0|What do you expect from Diana Krall?  Well, you get it.  She is an amazing performer:  marvelous pianist, superb vocalist, and meticulous arranger.  This is one of her best, no doubt, but I can't be trusted.  I think every album she's ever done is worthy of a Grammy or three.  This album certainly fits in perfectly with the others; wonderful listening to highlight a romantic evening or just relaxing on the patio.  I have played this so many times I worry that I'll wear it out.
B000FP2OPY|5.0|This is a really great series!  I currently own all of them, but there is still something special about the first season, in my opinion.
B007IXWL2C|4.0|Fifty Shades Freed is the third book of the Fifty Shades trilogy. It was a good book but not as good as the first one-Fifty Shades of Grey. I would recommend reading all three though,
B009LUCPWQ|4.0|Graham Parker and the Rumour's first effort together in 31 years is well worth the wait... great songs, great execution and playing!
B00846REIS|5.0|Intense..didn't want to put it down!! Better than 50 shades of grey! Ready for the next one!! Sylvia day will be an author on my top ten list
B0009UC7HA|5.0|I really love this film!  I happened to watch it one day on tv and it has quickly become one of my brother and my's favorite films.  It tends to be undersold a lot, but it is definitely worth your time.
B007BVOEPI|5.0|This series is awesome with a great set of characters & story line.<br />Don't expect to be able to burn it to disc or move it to your iTunes<br />Library.
B005EGXTL2|5.0|Really enjoyed the story and the &#34;out of the box&#34; approach Suzanne has taken with this series. Very clever story with wonderfullly colourfull characters.<br /><br />Well done.
B009RI4ZKC|5.0|I gave this movie 5 stars because it was so engaging. The acting was spot on for this somewhat silly movie that spoke about pursuing your dream no matter what others might think. I highly recommend it.
B004SBQGHS|5.0|Beautiful graphics, difficult games making it very challenging, good way to kill time. Would pay a buck any time to avoid the ads.
B0055PGUYU|5.0|I bought this book for two reasons: to give me advice that would help me overcome bad habits that i have, and to assist me in developing new habits that i want. i found this book to be a very easy read, and even though i questioned the relevance of all the material that was given, i could understand it as a whole in the context of what the author was trying to accomplish.<br /><br />DID IT FULFILL MY REQUIREMENTS?<br />Yes it did- and the fact is when it comes to habits there really isnt any quick fix. what you can expect to gain from this book is very helpful advice that you'd be able to use immediately to either develop new, or break old habits. if you are interested in learning either of these things, this is an excellent book to buy.
B007UPNA6Y|4.0|Jack does it again, shoots all the bad guys, but never quite gets any romance with all the tidy Women he meets.<br />Sad! A great story, lots of action, good pace well written.<br />Cheers<br />Lionel
0425263908|5.0|LOVE LOVE LOVE ~!! Cannot wait until the third book in this series comes out. I love Sylvia Day and her books ;)
0375507256|3.0|Overall I liked it, it wasn't a book I'll re read. Two of the story lines I found compelling, the rest not as much.
B0042X9L6A|5.0|i saved to buy this flash, and even though ive had it for just over one month, i love the results im getting with it so far. i cant even remember now if my camera has a pop up flash, because with this flash you forget all about that. all of my portrait work come out well exposed now, and for the uses to which i put my flash, it doesnt require tedious adjustments and tweaks. My only regret is that i have to buy more hardware, in order to use it off camera, as the D5100 doesnt offer that feature. All in all, you wont regret it at all.
B007KOYEOC|3.0|Still a good read but not as easy to read as 1st book. I enjoyed the read regardless. Keep writing E L James!!!
0425263916|5.0|Favorite series since Fifty Shades of Grey !! I loved this book and it only took my a day to read!! Strongly recommend.
B000MQC9H4|5.0|This is a great feel good holiday movie. Nothing too heavy. Good soundtrack too. Makes you feel good after watching it.
B009NQKXYK|5.0|I saw Prometheus in the theater and was blown away.  When I watched it the second time I noticed more details than I did the first time.  It's is going to be one of the few movies I can watch over and over again.  The picture quality was great and the sound was fantastic.
B007L3BMGA|4.0|Brave writer. Excellent scenes for a movie R18! I was finding it hard to put down and looking fwd to the next book.
B009VB7QQA|2.0|This would have been better off not being made into a movie.  Too many details left out that made the story.
B002JVWQSW|5.0|Not much to say - this is a great series and keeps us laughing. We are looking forward to the next season!
B00A11AN6O|5.0|It Only took a few minutes to transfer all my pictures to the cloud.  Amazon kindle is a great product.
B005EGXTHG|4.0|Very hard to put down. Well done again Suzanne. Keep writing. Some classic scenes and clever action sequences. Bring on the next book.
B002D0L0R2|5.0|This is such a fun fun movie. And c'mon you can't beat John Travolta, Christopher Walkin and Zach Efron. Not to mention the wonderful Queen Latifah. Great movie!
B002NZTZ8S|3.0|Felt like this movie was a bit &#34;dark&#34; and not a great kid movie. Parts can be a bit frightening to a young child. Fine for older kids, probably the ones beyond the age that can still hear the sleigh bells.
B004GYY714|5.0|It was great to get this in the kindle so I can listen to some of my favorite radio stations.
B006RXQ800|5.0|I enjoyed this movie and learn something new every time I watch it. It is a good representation of the hardships immigrants faced as well as the fact that the racist or &#34;us versus them&#34; mentality has been around for a long long time. I enjoyed all of the actors and they fit very well in their respective roles. Mr. Scorsese you created a masterpiece.....
B004IYWN7C|5.0|My 5 year old loved this movie and it was convenient to watch on Amazon.com. We have rented it twice and I'm sure a third time is right around the corner!
B003L77G06|5.0|Not much to say - this is a great series and keeps us laughing. We are looking forward to the next season!
B000W94FE6|5.0|Well written, well researched. Helps one to understand hoe the mind works, how we are conditioned by our environment and how to gain greater satisfaction and joy from everyday life.<br />I would strongly recommend this book.
B007KOMTUI|5.0|Entertaining to watch. This is a TV show that can capture an adult's attention... one that enjoys using their brain at least...
0345803493|5.0|This is a great read. It has adult content, but it is well written. I couldn't wait to pick up the next book.
B006YXTRHY|5.0|i really like this movie. i am a big twilight geek. it's probably my 3rd favorite of the series. i like having it on my kindle too cause i can take it anywhere.
0789310627|3.0|One of my favourite artists. I have most of the series now, however, I was very let down with the quality and colour of the editions I have received from Amazon - the colours are dull, printed on dull paper. I have an edition of &#34;This is San Francisco&#34; which I purchased many years ago, printed in Germany, and the colours are clear and bright - the books I received from Amazon, printed in China are disappointing.
B002BWP49C|5.0|We love this movie.  We have watched it twice and can't wait for the Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn 2 to come out.
0345803507|5.0|This is a great read. It has adult content, but it is well written. I couldn't wait to pick up the next book.
B009SQRL4U|5.0|this is a really cute funny movie,that will get the kids into the holiday spirt.<br />this movie is a whole new take on santa and his elves. my family really enjoyed it.
B000OVLBGC|5.0|One of the best movies I have ever seen - profoundly moving. Lives lived under the watchful eye of a &#34;Big Brother&#34; secret service - and how the restraints of freedom affect those who have no choice but to accept the situation.
B0084IG7KC|5.0|We saw this movie at the theaters and couldn't wait to buy it for our collection.  We love it and will look forward to the next installment.
0345803485|5.0|This is a great read. It has adult content, but it is well written. I couldn't wait to pick up the next book.
B002N44XSG|5.0|this book is super fun. i cannot understand why anyone would not like it. i hope you find this review helpful this is definitely a good book
B00992CF6W|5.0|So, I'm 36 and have no interest in this game at all, but my boys 8 and 10 LOVE it.  They can't get enough of it.  I don't care what edition, pocket, PC, XBox...and all their friends love it too.  They become creative with this game.  They learn about math concepts, and architectural concpets as well as setting up a base of operations to protect their stuff from the bad guys.
B00A77II0U|5.0|I have played quite a few of these type games and this is one of the best by far. The story line is fantastic and the back groud is very detailed. this one will DEFINITELY keep you entertained. This is worth the money.
B0047WJ12K|2.0|I really did not like this movie very much.  I found it to be long drawn out and predictable.  I lost interest about halfway through and suffered through the remainder of it.  I probably should have just turned it off.
B0034G4P80|2.0|It was OK, but I didn't like that it seemed a shallow setup for The Avengers.  Movies should stand on their own first, and this one fell flat with a lack of Loki development and something else I can't quite put my finger on.  It was just a perfect storm of unappealing camera work and acting quality I suppose.  It wasn't as creative as I expected with this kind of story.
B005HJWWW8|3.0|I've been using this for almost 3 months with a DAC attached to my laptop.<br />I needed an amp because the DAC I bought didn't have any volume controls, so I always have the fiio charging (I never use it portably). I'm fine with the sound, and the sound is definitely better than that of my laptop.<br />The only problem is that I hear very high pitched sounds from my headphones when the amp is charging. I cant hear it when I'm listening to music or watching a movie, but when I'm not, it gets quite annoying.<br />On the other hand, I guess this would not be a problem for portable use.
B007SGLZP8|3.0|It was a typical Grisham. You learn a lot and he manages to keep you turning the pages and not wanting to put the book down.
B009HV2JT8|3.0|As the title says I was really excited to see this movie, then I watched it.  Perhaps my excitement was tilted toward a slightly more action packed adventure, instead of a mildly action packed historical drama.  It was just okay.
B004UJAOLM|5.0|Amazon almost always send an email asking customers to review books they have recently purchased. When I recieved one such email asking me to review Wuthering Heights my first thought was that I would not dare to even try to say anything about such a classic book. But I have just finished reading it again after many years and I had forgotten how wonderful and musical it is. The words flow on the pages like music to your ears. The characters are so engaging, even those you love to hate, and the settings are so real. I feel like I have spent the last few days in an eighteenth century manor house, in the kitchen, near the fire, listening to an amazing story being told by a humble house keeper. I think that sometimes today we forget how inspired beautiful prose, can really make us feel, for hours at a time I forgot all my modern day worries and my hectic work load and just enjoyed a truly wonderful reading experience. Do yourself a favour and reread this book, and if you have never read it then do so you wont be sorry.
B005FISC52|5.0|What a good wrap up.  Kept it different and entertaining with a few oldies back for good measure. Great series!
B008XCPO2Q|5.0|it was a new blu ray dvd just as advertised, works good, the price was good and it did not take long to get
B0055D3EFU|4.0|Starts quiet then gets pretty scary, then ends medium scary.  It had some really oddball stuff in the netherworld, which added interest during the not as scary portion.  I liked it and I will make sure to watch the sequel because the downside to this movie is that it doesn't really end... It just has a big uh-oh scene to set the stage for part two.
B007JNR4XW|5.0|Bought this as a gift for my special someone. Ordering was very convenient and easy. When the product arrived it was in great condition and it works great.
B00684J49U|4.0|These were great withthe last episode throwing in a twist of what will happen next season...who will be in next season.
B009LK6JS2|4.0|Fun game for free.  Limited on what you can do, but entertaining nonetheless.  Would be nice if could engage targets, but that's how they hook you into buying the combat game.
B005LAIIHG|5.0|So I came out of the theater and for the next two hours I didn't know what to think of but this film. Graphically it is the best film I have seen at the movies. It is better and more appealing to me than Avatar or Avengers were. This is also the kind of film which definitely deserves a chorus when the oscar bells chime. The acting is stunning and the visuals are beyond. I never read the book but for once I don't seem to regret it because the film was such a journey of sorts. For someone who doesn't think highly of 3D, I enjoyed it a lot. I am going to say one more thing. I don't know why you're reading this review, don't let anyone tell you a thing about the film, just go watch it before it's too late. Take my word for it. Come back and tell us what you thought. Go now.
0060254920|5.0|An imaginative, dreamy read; Where The Wild Things Are is well known and loved by many. Author, Maurice Sendak enchants the reader into the depth of a young boy's mind. The wild, imagination of a young boy, Max, journeys across worlds into a land of large creatures he refers to as \\"wild things\\". Sendak uses a descriptive, but simple dialogue that doesn't fail to guide the reader through this journey with Max as he dances and plays a long with these magnificent creatures. Where The Wild Things Are is an enchanting story that has been enjoyed by children for many years and I'm sure will be enjoyed for many to come.
B005LAII08|5.0|What's not to like?  This is a fantastic movie with a VERY strong princess--she doesn't need a Prince Charming at all, and she has both her mother AND her father in her life.  Beautiful story, beautiful graphics, lots of fun!
B0053O89JM|5.0|The description was accurate and the shipper was timely. Watched the whole season in three nights.  The package came in great shape.
B005LAIHXQ|2.0|My problem with Prometheus is definitely not the star cast or the graphics. I don't think the storyline was horrible but it wasn't going anywhere. The acting is horrible and the direction even worse and towards the end if you compare with better Science Fiction films it looks very pretentious. The last half hour was quite bad because of how the story dives down and the submission to the aliens. The characters that were built up for destruction like a Cabin in the woods really had no purpose of attention in the first place. Some say this was a prequel to some other film and some say there is a sequel coming, the acting and directing was quite horrible I felt. Michael Fassbender who is usually a terrific actor was quite mediocre in this, there was no sync in his character from beginning to end even though...*insert spoiler* The director didn't seem to know whether to make a Jurassic Park out of this film, or whether to make a Planet of the Apes or whether to just make this film \\"The Core\\" and trying to do so many things at once proved a little unbecoming for the viewer. I could have used more films as pawns. I wish the story line was built up better and there was more answers than the viewers being left to believe what is best. I felt this miss film was made for the hit or miss generation. In the year where films like \\"Tuckers and Dale v/s Evil\\" are doing well, Prometheus will obviously do better. I don't think I'm going to watch the sequel.
B009CPGHDI|5.0|we love katy perry and this movie solidified that love! it's a great movie and really shows you more about her life.
1439170916|5.0|It's hard to top the description of the book that you'll find on Amazon, because it's pretty much bang-on.<br /><br />This is no light read, and I'm glad I bought the unabridged audiobook (a 10 hour drive also meant that I had uninterrupted time to soak it all in). Now that I've listened to it (twice), I want the print version.<br /><br />After reading this book, I have a new and profound respect for the work that has gone into understanding cancer. Ironically, I'm also left with an awe at the forces within our medical and research societies that don't always work toward a common end.<br /><br />If nothing else, this book reveals the reality of cancer as \\"part of us\\"... within us all lies the makings of genetic mutations gone mad.<br /><br />Read it all. The history of cancer research and application has its twists and turns, false hopes and amazing advances. Mukherjee brings you to present day, to the place of human genome mapping, and he'll leave you wanting to learn and understand even more.
B00A3AYI50|5.0|I have been waiting for this album to come out since he won American Idol.  NOT ONE BIT DISAPPOINTED! LOVE IT
B00008O89K|5.0|I usually don't buy sound tracks but the music on this CD is awesome.  It's powerful and blood-stirring and at times beautiful in a barbarian way. There is even music for when you're with your favorite warrior princess after a hard a day of destroying your enemies, driving them before you, and hearing the lamentation of the woman.  I recommend it for those who like powerful music and pounding drums.
B008JMKN4Y|3.0|I enjoyed this book- thought it was very entertaining! It wasn't necessarily a &#34;stay up all night to finish it&#34; kind of book but I read it on a plane and it kept me occupied!
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Reminded me quite a bit of \\"The Firm\\" ... the racing around trying to keep one step ahead of disaster.  I didn't find this book as suspenseful as \\"The Firm\\", but I thoroughly enjoyed all the shenanigans.  It cheered me up immensely when I wasn't feeling particularly well.
B009KUANWG|3.0|Great for 007 but not for the radio.  I love Adele and anything she sings.  This is a great soundtrack for the movie but not so good for easy listening.
B008GXHOFW|1.0|purchased. downloaded.  fail. screen goes black after the opening video scene. something needs to be fixed or refunds should  be issued
B006LSZECO|5.0|This was a fantastic book- I would highly recommend it. You won't be able to put it down and the ride Gillian Flynn has created is phenomenal!
B000BVMAJ2|5.0|Perfect for the just 2 and a little bit under crowd. Nice, affordable birthday present for parties.  A family favorite!
B005LLSNNE|5.0|This is the best show on television.  I would recommend you watch these shows from the beginning.  It gets better and better with every new season.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|I believe that I stand with the majority of the other reviewers here when I say that this app is very easy to use! There's not much else to say besides that beyond being easy to use, it's extremely customizable and has a sleek interface.
B0085A9J18|5.0|Good Fight Movie !  The moves and styles were very impressive.  No special effects or running across water,  just good ol fashioned martial arts fighting only stepped up a couple of notches.
B009CG2YDE|4.0|i enjoyed playing this game and had a blast trading levels with my son. would recommend this to any old school gamer.
B009NPK1IO|3.0|I liked Gossip Girl from the beginning but the last couple of seasons are not as good as the first three.
0375413405|5.0|I'm sure this is a great book but it was bought as a gift for a young cook that wanted to try all of Julia's recipes.
B000026F7T|4.0|I had the cassette of this and wanted to upgrade to the more current format.  The music is probably more suited to the 50+ crowd. The lively songs just make you want to get up and dance!!
B006TKP2B2|3.0|I enjoyed reading this book but was expecting something more in the end.  It was beautifully written and had all the elements of a great story, but I was disappointed the the characters lives didn't intersect more, or that there wasn't a satisfying conclusion to the various story lines.  I understand that this is a future where there is little hope, and maybe that's what the author wanted to convey.  Even in our dimmest hour mankind finds a way to rise above--at least I like to think so.  Perhaps capitalism and free trade cast too great a shadow even for the authors imagination to shine through.  Mankind has had its chance and it blew it, and nothing can save it.  Oh well.  Like I said, it was an interesting read, but dropped at the end and left me baffled and unsatisfied.
B003WUYRGI|5.0|I use it for looking up words that I do not understand when I read books<br /><br />For fun or for studies
B0098460O4|5.0|Loved this CD....two young adults with talent to spare with a choice of songs which should be shared by all.  Their knowledge of both modern and operatic music belies their years.  Hope to see more of these two.
B004KBSQBA|5.0|I love this CD.  I had it as a cassette and wanted to hear it in a more up-to-date format.  The music is lively and fun.  I used to have a portable cassette player and took this cassette skiing as most songs have the perfect beat to ski to!!
0547884591|5.0|How I Heard About The Book...<br /><br />Like most people, I knew about this books pending release via Tim (and his blog) ... but it was Ryan Holiday that hooked me up with a pre-release advance copy of the book to check out prior to publication ... so I had something to chat about with Ti when he came on the PreneurCast show.<br /><br />The Lesson/Argument in Three Sentences...<br /><br />Essentially the book is about deconstruction and learning, wrapped up in a chef's apron. Tim has done an exceptional job via his blog and first two books, to be a experiential journalist for the technorati'<br /><br />The book's first section on 'Meta Learning' was well worth the price of admission and focuses on a framework DSSS [Deconstruction, Selection, Sequencings and Stakes] which is essentially how Tim approaches any new \\"task\\"<br /><br />The book then don's the Chef Hat; and walks people through the application of this these 'Meta Learning' processes in the context of cooking. I really enjoyed the layout/process here; as it's sets the frame first, then takes you through full immersion and internalisation. (especially for someone like me who eats for survival, not pleasure)<br /><br />If you're looking for a cook book, yeah it's there ... but this is more of a \\"how to learn, master and become world class\\" as the sub-title says.<br /><br />Why Read It ...<br /><br />I think everyone needs to be get better at learning, in every sense of the word .... and there are very few better to learn from then Tim.  I really do think the term experiential journalist' sums Tim up, much much better then 'life-hacking guru' or something similar; as his first two books, when you break them down is exactly that reports, lessons and finding some experiment and experiences he has actually had' ... This book then takes the approach Tim used to \\"have\\" those experiences and gives  you the tools to experiment, learn and become world-class yourself.<br /><br />Key Chapters ...<br /><br />Yes the book has me behind the stove cooking a few dishes, which is making the wifey very happy... but it's the 1st and 5th chapters that are key to this book for most of our community.<br /><br />Pg 40.

B009VB7QQA|2.0|Unfortunately this is a terrible film. The production values are certainly at &#34;B&#34; movie levels and the acting led to little comfort too. This film is not worthy of your time commitment.
B0063GORYU|3.0|This game is a normal okay game. Nothing great and nothing disappointing. If you like to play then it works just fine.
B00A8ECU24|4.0|The game stays true to the optimistic nature of tv series.Simple &amp; clear controls make each mini game a delight to play.The music is cutesy and upbeat.It easy to share game play with your facebook friends.All your favorite ponys are there to help with cities growth through various fun quests guided by spike.In short well worth the wait and the reason I got my kindle fire HD.A must for every fan young and old.
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|A lot of fun, even more than Angry Birds, I think.  Good workout for the brain and makes for a lot of smiles!
B009NQKPUW|3.0|This is definitely not the greatest sci-fi movie ever made.  But it's also certainly not the worst.  I found it entertaining with enough going on to keep me intellectually tuned-in.  The ending leave a big unnecessary hole for a sequel so there are some loose ends that I would have preferred get addressed.  All-in-all, I'm glad I waited for it to come out on video but not disappointed that I watched it.
B0011Z0YFE|5.0|This is a great album from Madonna. I think there were only two tracks which I wasn't too crazy about but overall I was happy that I made this purchase! Favorite song!!! - Get Together
B003ZSJ212|5.0|Unlike most Star Wars fans, I don't hate the Prequels (even though I found them hard to watch), they offer insight to how the galaxy far far away developed into the gritty reality we see in the Original Trilogy.  Whether you enjoy all the Prequels, and the Special Editions of the Original Trilogy, or want to see what was left on the cutting room floor, this collection is worth it and then some!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|awesome fun.  so glad my daughter downloaded it. its crazy adddictive :)  I just wish you didn't have to pay for the extra packs
B0092MKFIY|1.0|What television show did this worthless piece of crap band get played on to get exposure enough to get this many positive reviews? What a collection of gutless manufactured garbage assembled for your consumption. Open wide to be spoon fed the latest crap band of the moment for your empty mind to digest and deposit in the toilet.
B00A7ZWUJC|5.0|Rihanna's seventh album is by far her best album so far with songs like numb and diamonds.  I like the more upbeat songs better than anything.
B001TH16DI|5.0|From Star Trek: The Motion Picture to Star Trek IV: The Undiscovered Country, you will enjoy these stories of triumph and tragedy over and over again.
B0015DWJX2|5.0|This was a very good book. I like the letter format and storyline it had. It blended well together. It was the first time I had read a book with this kind of format but I found it worked well. I liked these characters. It was a very easy read. Sad but hopeful. I love books with a little mystery.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|great game with a lot of games with hours of free play and a variety. of cool games for all ages
B008458O3S|5.0|Really fun Game. Use your problem solving skills, Color Combine and perfect your timing. Great game lots of fun progressive levels.
B005LAIH9K|5.0|Finally a sequel with the entire cast! Ever wondered how married life is treating Jim and Michelle?  Where did Kevin, Oz, Stiffler, Finch, Vicki, and everyone end up?  This movie has all the answers and even gives Stiffler the revenge he has desired on Finch.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|After hearing friends talk about this app I decided I had to try it. It's so addictive! There are so many different aspects and things you can do. I would definitely recommend this game - I couldn't believe it was free!
B009CG2YDE|5.0|This thing is very silly, but very easy to play. You do not have to be a hardcore gamer to enjoy it either. I keep thinking I am going to remove the app, but I tell myself I will play this ridiculous thing one more time and forget to remove it. Total guilty pleasure. Don't get this app. You will not be able to stop playing.
B00992CF6W|5.0|THIS IS THE NUMBER 1 minecraft app ever me and my sis play multiplayer all the time. totally worth $6.99

B00004U8P9|4.0|Took a bit longer to show up than hoped but item was perfect quality and works and such. Just took longer than hoped to show up.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I could not put the book down.  Something about the gritty miserable existence of these people kept me engaged along with all of the questions.  My only criticism which is self serving is it ended too rapidly and neatly.

B007HACDLK|5.0|Wow, I started this book and I can't put it down. I could not wait for Vince's new book and so far i'm in \\"hog heaven\\". Thank you for being such an outstanding author.<br />  I read in the preview that Mr. Flynn might have cancer. If that is the case, my prayers go out too him and family. A plus (+ 10) for the \\"phenomenal\\" book.
B009FZFONO|5.0|I purchase the episode every week when it is available, and usually watch multiple times throughout the week.  Ummm, do I need an intervention?
B0012HRJEA|2.0|Oh, to be 12 and not care about quality.<br /><br />I remember going to see this in the theater and thinking it was so great and edgy and artistic.  I was actually looking forward to watching it again.<br /><br />BARF.<br /><br />Actors stumble over the dialogue.  The hyperkinetic editing makes me dizzy.  John Leguizamo is as awful as ever.<br /><br />At least this one doesn't have Ewan McGregor singing like some other Baz Luhrmann blerg-fests.
B00ABWYG16|5.0|I was a little worried when I saw it was all in French, but the lyrics flow brilliantly with the music. Their best album so far, surpassing my previous favorite Lemuria/Sirius B
B0027BVMSY|3.0|The dialogue is especially hard to understand, much of it being delivered in clipped dialectic English.  The action scenes are fairly ridiculous at times, i.e. who knew human beings could fight like that?  And the ending is supposed to be a scene with Bond making love to a fair lady, not having a depressed conversation with his boss!

B000YHG72E|4.0|This is a really fun modern Christmas story.  It's inoffensive for the younger children, but smart and funny for adults.  This is aimed for the crowd that grew up on the Rankin-Bass Christmas specials.
B000JML7EC|5.0|It involved older, more experienced men in comparison to the young and daring lad. He learned from these men but had to eventually make some risky decisions of his own.
B007PVHANM|5.0|Excellent film! Other books and films have attempted to deify Mr. Marley- this work makes a better attempt of presenting a complete human being. Thank you to the family for allowing the world a better glimpse into the life of this remarkable person. The commonsense wisdom of choosing peaceful coexistence is a seed that needs to be sown now more than ever, and the life of this man continues to do that.

B000JMLFLW|5.0|It kept me guessing.There was a variety of income levels as to the characters. It was unexpected as to which guy the ladies would end up with!
B001AQO3QA|1.0|If You want to keep these movies for a private collection, and never open them; then this is the set for you. If you want to enjoy the classics again and again, then you better be very careful getting your discs out of the awful packaging. My first movie is already scratched just by trying to get it out of the package.<br />  I don't really know what is going on with the brains of some designers today. They want to design and redesign and screw  things all over again.<br />  Why not stay with one package format? why can't we be just simple?<br />  So this is what I'm Going to do: I will transfer all of my Alien collection to classic blu ray cases and search online for the  sleeve cover of every single movie. Then I'm going to print them and insert them into the classic blu ray cases I already have; then I'm going to send this stupid package to the recycle container. Perhaps like that, I could keep the real classic treasure safe: The actual Blu rays movies.<br />  So buyers beware! The package although very heavy, fancy and classy is in fact useless for the well care of the disc itself.<br />  For all those who complain about my review: I tell you before hand, I'm not reviewing the movies but the package in which the movies are kept. The movies are 5 stars, otherwise I would not have bought them. but the packaging 0 Stars. There would be those who differ, but this was my experience.
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|I loved all the different levels of this game. I have tried several types of mahjong games and this one rates up there with all the others.So download or purchase and play away.
B002KYHZLQ|5.0|This book is just the beginning of an excellent series. New and innovative high fantasy. The story keeps the excitement level up and the character building is phenomenal.  I put this series of books on my top ten list of all times.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love this game and think it is a really good game so I recommed it a lot and I think it is worth $6.99
B00AA7O6QC|5.0|From the opening scene to the last one liner, this was a dope flick. I would def watch this movie again.
B008MEM24S|5.0|Challenging but not to hard. Great game for adults &amp; kids! The whole family plays it. There are a lot of levels also.
B004LWZW24|4.0|In my opinion this was a very good scary movie. I'm someone who can watch scary movies and not be phased, but this movie creeped me out at times. Good movie to watch once, but not something that I would watch again.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|good game it is so addicting and it rocks and it sometimes glitches but it is fun anyway so ge
B00785P2QC|2.0|It's a similar concept, but much too time-consuming (there's a lot of wait time involved to get anything done unless you wish to purchase credits) and encourages (practically requires, for the purposes of earning certain hard-to-get elements) much more facebook interaction than I am comfortable with, or inclined to comply with.
B00847UYWA|4.0|The King in Yellow is one of the most brilliant--and one of the most disappointing--collections of short stories I have ever read. The first five stories were tremendous, transcendent, stunning. I could not look away. The last few stories were woefully disappointing. It is clear to me that they were added solely to fill out a word count. It's disappointing, but it does not diminish the power of those five stories. Pick the book up and read those stories. You will not be disappointed.
B007Q0OV6Q|4.0|Got a couple of these last year for gifts to people and it was quite popular. Even gave one to my boss's son.<br />Pro tip: lego.com has this at a much lower price, 24.99 is what I'm seeing today.
B0048IMZMG|5.0|I really enjoyed listening to Taylor.  I listen to this album at least once a day.  Really fun songs and sassy lyrics make her albums fun to listen to.  I totally recommend to any music/Taylor fan.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|I didn't like the book - the writing skills of this author were terrible.  There were too many email references - not enough substance.  I will not purchase any of the next in the series.
B009LDXQGW|5.0|First of all before The Trilogy was released I was always a fan of The Weeknd. For him being one of the first artists to take all his mix-tape songs and albums and release on hard copy to actually by in one place was amazing! I must say this album is priceless and I can honestly say I played this all the way through no skips and I'm still jamming to this in my car. It was worth the money and it was worth the investment! You should totally buy! I love it!
B000SJJCX4|1.0|It costs 20 bucks because it's a piece of junk! Don't but it. It takes a very long time to hone in on the note you're tunning. The \\"grip\\" part where you put your foot to push down on just slipped off one day and I only had it for a couple of months...Not well made at all. Im on my way to go buy a Boss TU3...more money buy much better product im sure.
B007FG9LIE|5.0|I loved the surprise ending, and the way it unfolds. At the start I thought it was just another crime mystery, but I stuck with it for a few chapters and when some unexplainable events occurred, I knew it would take something special to resolve the plot.<br /><br />And resolve it did - Fantastic read, I seriously couldn't put it down. Well, I did put it down eventually; at 5am when I'd finished reading it!
0783222149|5.0|A great movie with meryl streep and kevin bacon. The two power actors do a great job with this movie! It keeps you interested all the way through with a twist for sure! A lot of people can relate to the characters for the most part I think.
B009VB97EY|1.0|pure trash pure trash pure trash pure trash pure trash pure trash pure trash pure trash pure trash!  Hated it!  Not worth the money!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This book was something different than my usual read, and even thought it took me some time to get adjusted to the story line and the characters, I love it now. You have to get through the first &#34;hump&#34; of the book, as my co-worker said. Pun intended.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I love the big numbers, at last one calculator than I can use without problems of hitting the wrong key.
0545265355|5.0|I bought them  before the movie. Catchy books I recomend them to every age group. You will find yourself following the Hunger Games craze. great author.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I think temple run is a exstrodensrey game. its not to easy but its not to hard its right there int the middle. I think more people should get it.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I absolutely could not put this book down. It interested me and I became enthralled with the characters and the plot. I would highly recommend this book to anyone looking for something similar to 50 Shades of Grey. However, I do believe Sylvia Day is a better writer.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Read the first book and loved it so much I moved onto the second book! Can't wait to finish this book and begin the next!
B004L3AR0K|5.0|Funny, Sad This movie has it all. Two great actors! Interesting story. I would recomend it to teens and adults due to a few sexual things in the movie.
B001NHN7TU|4.0|Loved it in the 80's, story and humor sill holds up! Kevin Bacon young and energetic. Great fun!<br />Spawned sequels which don't hold a candle to this original.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|This was probably my favorite of the three books in the series. A lot of people complain about the author's style of writing, however, I love the book and the writing for what it is...a good read.
0312330537|2.0|Oh, my Lord.  Yes, the descriptions of Bombay were good.  But I knew by Page 22 (where Lindsay meets Karla) that Roberts is a very immature writer and I would gain little by slogging through the rest of this overwritten, self-regarding mess, except that I had to, for my book club.  I did my duty.  Now I have to think of something to say, if I'm pressed, that doesn't sound angry.  I looked at the photo of Roberts on the back cover of the book.  I have no trouble believing he's an ex-con.
B00005BJ2O|5.0|If you love the music or the movie. GET THIS. its all your favorites from the film. My favorite track: COME WHAT MAY
B004WJRF6C|5.0|What can you say about Paul McCartney?  He is perfect.  I had this album when I was younger, and love having the CD in my collection.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|This series is so interesting and offers something different than your typical read. I'm usually not interested in this type of story, however, I gave it a try and loved it!
B009C7JS14|5.0|This is my favorite weather app, because it has everything I need on one page. It has proven to be very accurate.
B00005JKGZ|5.0|A Classic Garland Film! I've loved it since a child, and bought it on DVD now so I can enjoy the restored and clearer version of it. A story about love, family christmas, and a fair among others. A true jem.
B008GXHOFW|2.0|We have had many problems with loading this game to play it.  Instructions are insufficient.  4-year-old enjoys manipulating the spiderman character, but that's the extent of our enjoyment of the game.
B00846REIS|5.0|I read the 50 Shades of Grey book series and loved it. When I was done, I wanted more and this book series by Sylvia Day is just what I needed! Very interesting plot line, characters, and steamy love scenes.
B008HK3XU4|5.0|Just what I needed to keep my Kindle Fire HD safe from the world as I know it.<br />It feels so good to be able to close it up and know that it is protected!!<br />Love the color and feel of it too!!!
B00005QZ7U|5.0|If you love a good love story and great music watch this movie! beautiful acting by nicole kidman and ewan mcgregor. WARNING! this movie will make you cry!!
1606863622|4.0|\\"Dear John\\" is a very easy, fluid read. It as just the right amount of suspense to it in a way where you arent sure who the characters are going to end up with or end up as. The not-so-happy ending is the perfect plot twist to end the book. Sparks takes you on a journey with each individual character. The reader watches the characters grow and watches their relationships bloom and falter. Very interesting twist to a cliche story.
B003Y5D776|4.0|I Think This product was very good. It allowed be to get sound out of my Macbook Air without being an expensive fix. The only problem i have with it (though i don't know if it's actually the air) is that sometimes it'll not show up on the computer and i'll have to re-plug it in. Other than that, it's a great product!!
0547884591|5.0|I first read the 4-Hour Work Week after a friend had a random PDF of it (sorry, Tim!). I was hooked. That book alone has saved me DAYS of my life.<br /><br />After the 4HWW, I read the 4-Hour Body and it was my Bible for getting back into shape. I probably turned 30 people on to that book (hopefully that makes up for the unpaid PDF) and many have seen great success.<br /><br />Anyway, about the 4-Hour Chef:<br />- I always like to cook, but hate having random ingredients around. My food almost always goes bad. The recipes in the book have very FEW ingredients. I'd encourage you to buy the ingredients for one recipe at a time. It's easy to get over-zealous with this stuff.<br />- As other people have mentioned, this is not just about cooking - there is all sorts of great information about learning. I'm planning on learning the guitar in the next couple weeks and I'll be using Tim's principles.<br />- I made the steak recipe in the book the other night and it was AWESOME. Easily one of the best steaks I've ever had.<br /><br />Get the book, you won't be disappointed.
B001OQCV6A|5.0|if you love these hot guys, you'll love how funny they are together in this movie. Truly clever and funny movie.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|this was a quick read - i had a hard time putting it down.<br />stimulating, mysterious, a deep and hopeful scape of heaven one could only dream (or die) to experience.<br />a rather accessible yet technically adequate description of the scientific and medical conditions precipitating his experience.<br /><br />i personally experienced a surprisingly profound series of ... moments of deep spiritual resonance (? how do i explain this ?) while reading this book and i encourage anyone to see whether or not Alexander's experience resonates with them.
B005P4PAVK|5.0|I just got into this show this year and it is awesome and funny I do tell other people to see it
B008K8VDPU|4.0|I got this so I could play duets with my grandson on our tablets, and it allows me to do that very nicely, with a few other options as well.  I like the built-in songs that you can play along with (either the right of left-hand parts).  There is a choice of some musical instruments to pick from, but I find they don't alter the sound much on my Samsung Galaxy Tab, that's why I didn't give it five stars.  I am happy with this app and recommend it.
0783225482|5.0|I've watched this since a kid. I'm a huge fam of Meryl Streep so I think this is one of her funniest roles. Some may say the movie is a bit cheesy but if you're like me and enjoy that kind of humor you'll love the movie!
B00724351S|5.0|I have enjoyed this collection very much--The many artists prove that its impossible to go wrong with a Bob Dylan tune!
B009E3EY38|5.0|Because I couldn't be there - I just watched the Bluray DVD!!!!! WOW, WOW, DOUBLE WOW!!! I saw The Who last year & The Stones the year before - and with Led Zep it proves that 40 years of practice make perfection. How good will they be in another 20 years?
B007THA4FI|1.0|This worthless book only got one star because I had to give it one to submit the review.<br />Rowlings storytelling skills, so evident in the Potter series, described characters for whom I have no sympathy and no interest. Could not read even the first hundred pages of this dreadful book. I read to enjoy, not to get depressed. If there was some lovely redemption or moral victory, it was lost on me. If I could get a refund on this horrid thing, I would.
B0013D8LOK|5.0|Do You think Johnny Depp is hot? His voice is too! He actually sings with his own voice in this movie. A lot of great actors in this as well!
B008602KQI|3.0|The movie, in and of itself, strikes an interesting look at humanity in general.  However, when a tall teenager grabs a younger teen and spins his head around killing him, this movie definitely merits an R-rating.  It's not shown off screen either.  Taking a 13 year old child to this movie is completely irresponsible.  The MPAA should be ashamed of itself.  It's absolutely amazing what they can get away with now in PG-13 movies.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Offers hours of fun for my grandson and myself! Never too old for this game. There are so many different levels and layouts that can be quite challenging!
B001C46P2K|2.0|The movieIQ and the BD Live features, which is the reason I purchased the blue ray edition, DON'T WORK.<br />Extremely irritating to purchase a product and discover the extra features don't work.
B000X1T7MS|5.0|In the interest of hearing both sides of the Islam story, read this book.  You won't get this viewpoint in any media source.
0375842209|5.0|This is one of the most wonderful books I have read in such a very long time.  The descriptions were amazing - your could just taste the words!! I listened to the book narrated beautifully - I just love someone telling me a story - I actually sat in my car in the driveway listening the the final words - and crying for the joy of it all.  Thank you, Markus, for sharing your imagination with the world!!
B008OOYALE|5.0|They are very creative with all their dragons and dragon eggs. Its fun to see all the different ones.  You don't get glued cause its on a timer and you have to wait so you aren't always on.  Wish there was a way to delete an egg if you don't want it though.  That would be really nice.
B00A3DZ61W|4.0|If you're a Star Wars fan you'll love this game. The angry build that uses the force is by far my favorite. Get this game
B0099G4Y26|5.0|This was my 1st time buying a digital cd and I am very happy with my purchase. It was great to buy the music I love instantly and enjoy it in many formats in no time. I burned a cd & sync to my mp3 for on the go listening. Plus I have a secure copy in amazon cloud. Its great!
B008GXHOFW|1.0|I purchased the app for my son.  We downloaded it and were able to see the trailer then the game returns us back to the carosel.
B005A1ER0I|5.0|Thomas Bergersen is kind of one of the guys from Two Steps From Hell. And it shows. This soundtrack is just beautiful. Music that makes you relax and enjoy life. But not so relaxed that you fall asleep. Just check it out, you'll know what I mean.
B001E5CH0G|5.0|The Blu-Ray came sealed in its original packaging and we had no problems with it working. Picture was great, sound, was great. No problems whatsoever with this disc. Great product and I will purchase many more through Amazon.com.
0307951529|2.0|Through many real life examples, the author tries to introduce the reader to the world of startups. Nothing really new or exciting, though. There are books much more better than this one.
B000YHG72E|4.0|Elf, is a charming and funny christmas film that is great for every age.  Will Ferrel brings a wonderful innocence and joyful energy to the charachter of Buddy the Elf who truly touches the lives of those he comes into contact with.
B009XY97VC|5.0|I love every album that Two Steps From Hell has released. They have a way of mixing the hard and the soft into melodies that just makes you feel good. Definitely a must have fore TSFH fans!
B0073CEC1G|5.0|I wore the tape out when I was in high school. This is a must have . . . .
B00846REIS|5.0|I loved this series just as much if not more than 50 shades. Just as sexy without the creepiness of bdsm
B0025KW29U|5.0|Anything Joss Whedon is amazing - and how can you dream of complaining when neil patrick harris and especially nathan fillion are involved!
B008458O3S|3.0|The game itself is great (I beat it) however, the phone runs hot and causes Amazon App store to use a very high cpu %'s (not sure about that linkage) to the point that if I play for too long the phone will restart itself.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This is the a grate book it I liked it so much it had  me up very late some nights just so I could see what happens.
B0067LY4WG|5.0|As Cohen ages, he just keeps getting better. If you have a chance to see him live, definitely do it. He's a master of language and music to evoke emotion and take you to a broader plane of understanding the human condition in the context of what has real meaning.
B00705GEO4|5.0|Excellent lyrics, roaring crescendos, and strong historical root. An exceptional accomplishment for any band, and even for Sabaton, it still surpasses expectations. Long Live the King and 1648 both stand out as memorable and impressive tracks. 10/10.
B00917IQFY|5.0|Another great effort by Graham Parker. Even though it's been many years since they recorded together they haven't lost the beat and GP's wit is razor sharp as ever.
B003VSVWA0|5.0|Cohen fans will want this in their collection. It's always great to see the artist in his own words. There will never be another one like him.
030758836X|5.0|A CAN'T PUT IT DOWN STORY  THE WRITER KEEPS THE MYSTERY SOLVING UNTIL THE END AND THEN THERE IS THE SURPRISE ENDING...  GOOD STORY  CUDOS
B000W91RUG|5.0|Where it all began! Got the entire set for a gift and absolutely LOVE IT! This show is hilarious...hour and hours of laughter and fun!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|The Hunger Games trilogy is wonderfully entertaining. The characters come alive and become like old friends. You really care about what happens to everyone. The entire story deals with some intense topics that make you think and the ending was unpredictable (to me, at least). I've read the whole trilogy a few times and it's just as good every time, even when you know how it ends.
B009RI4FRU|5.0|Never seen anything like this movie. It's great! It's hilarious and the color scheme in the movie blew my mind.
B003L77G6A|5.0|Got the entire set for a gift and absolutely LOVE IT! This show is hilarious...hour and hours of laughter and fun! Definitely recommend! The gift that keeps on giving!
B003O86FMW|5.0|I love the Hunger Games trilogy. The characters are engaging, the story is exciting, and you can't wait to read every chapter.
B005LAJ16I|5.0|Giving this series 5 stars is the easiest thing I ever done...HOMELAND is simple the BEST show on TV right now. I recieved my DVD in a timely matter and I have shared it with others. THANK YOU, AMAZON!
B002N5N4M6|5.0|Got the entire set for a gift and absolutely LOVE IT! This show is hilarious...hour and hours of laughter and fun!
B004GYY714|5.0|So easy to find and tune in to whatever music you're in the mood for....!  Almost like having Sirius/XM on your Kindle Fire.
B008458O3S|5.0|This game brings a ton of puzzles of increasing difficulty. After you complete it, you unlock another full set of &quot;bonus&quot; puzzles, which are even more fun than the original!
B001FB4VXU|5.0|Got the entire set for a gift and absolutely LOVE IT! This show is hilarious...hour and hours of laughter and fun! I watch one of my season disc each night and go to bed happy!
B00A3DZ61W|5.0|Anything Angry Bird is fun and this is no let down.  A brand new twist on the Angry Birds theme. Can't wait to see whats next.
B001DF68MA|5.0|We originally bought the same item at ToysRus and ended up getting a second one for our second child. This is a great bike seat. Super easy to install on a woman's and a men's bike and the kids love it. So much more fun than sitting in the back of the bike and starring at your back the whole time. The kids get to see everything and everywhere we go parents are asking us about it because they think it's a great seat.<br /><br />You will have to get used to riding with it though. It's a little awkward at first, since you have a pedal a little wider and getting on and off takes some getting used to since you have the seat right in front of you. Other than that it's a great product!!
0547884591|5.0|I've never read a cookbook cover to cover...and I still haven't!  What you've got here is NOT a cookbook.  Just like 4-Hour Body was not another fitness book and 4-Hour Work Week was not another self-help business book, the 4 Hour Chef is in a class by itself.  If you want JUST a cookbook, buy something else!  Personally, I've got enough of those already, taking up space on my shelves.<br /><br />The 4-Hour Chef is like a long conversation with Tim - though the metaphor falls a bit short as a conversation alone would leave out the incredible photography and sidebar graphics featured throughout this book.  Due to the conversational style, you will find yourself going off on tangents.  I guess I don't see this as a negative at all as long as the 'off the beaten path' bits are interesting and helpful - which they are!<br /><br />What makes this a 5 star book though is not just great writing, great content and pretty pictures.  To me, The 4 Hour Chef earns the 5th star due to the high 'replay' value and lifestyle impact I can predict for many months and years down the road.  As Tim tells you time and time again, cooking is used in this book as a framework for a more important conversation about how you design your life - a life where learning can be one of the keys to happiness.  Enjoy this book.
B008HTQ28K|3.0|This is a typical Grisham read; fast moving, tonque-in-cheeck humour, etc but we end up with our innocent protagonist teamed up with &#34;traditional&#34; drug dealers having the moral high ground above all governmental agencies? Before commencing to happly everaftering. Really? If this is now Grisham's outlook on life I'll spend my money on other authors, thank you.
B009329Y30|5.0|I believe there is real love out there for everyone. This movie was a very heartfelt love story I plan on seeing again.
B002BWP49M|5.0|So I do not really care about the movie, but I ordered it for my girlfriend and for $10 with the prime 2 day shipping. I must say i am very pleased with how quick it arrived. I ordered in a the 23rd and it was expected on the 28th  well i checked my mail on the 26th and low and behold the package is in my mailbox ready to be wrapped for Christmas. I will by from seller again. I recommend buying this for anyone of interest.
B00004SPVE|1.0|Love the movie and wanted it in my collection but it came from England and wouldn't play in my DVD player.
B008602KQI|5.0|The movie is excellent! It touches on so many ideals and wrong thinking by our society.  Sadly it portrays what some think our society is coming to.  I love Catness because she's smart, innovative and a smart A$$.  I identify with her wanting to protect and defend verses attacking, but there comes a time when it's enough and its time to fight back.  The movie is very Rambo and Point of no Return meets Blue Lagoon in that she's stuck, she can hunt and she's cunning.  It really is a must watch but don't leave the room because there's so much dialogue in it that's &#34;Telling&#34; the story and you can't miss a second of it.  I hope you enjoy like we all did
B009CPES4I|4.0|I enjoyed the movie because I could identify with the retired folks.  I enjoyed the photography in what I hope was Mumbai.  I would like to think I learned something about contemporary Mumbai culture.  The only negative is that the story line is a little thin.
B00007E7K0|5.0|It does exactly what it should it replaced the lens cape I lost for my Canon it fits well and stays on with no problem.
B009NPKTN6|1.0|Don't waste your money. Thought the worst thing would be Tom Cruise playing a rocker. It was the plot and the music that was lousy too.
B005NJU8PA|4.0|I'm thrilled to finally get another 4-hour book, this one will probably become my personal bible for learning/teaching.<br />The only thing preventing me from giving 5* is that many of the recommended items, restaurants etc. are not available to me, as I'm from Europe (and/or are very expensive to get). It was expected, but is frustrating nontheless. The other unpleasant matter is that if you want to follow Tim's Slow-carb diet, you basically need to become meatarian from top to bottom. And I prefer vegetarian food, which complicates things.<br />No worries, you can never please everyone.<br /><br />Now on the positive side:<br />I love the principle-based approach, real-life examples and a lot of gear recommendations (yes, even if I can't reach most of them).<br /><br />The book was worth it's $5 in the first 15%, when I realized an important point about human learning.<br /><br />Will read again and again.<br /><br />P.S.<br />Since I own only Kindle versions, I intend to buy also hardcovers when the finances allow me to. It'll be our family heirloom :-)
B009NPM5Y2|1.0|Horrible movie!!!  Don't waste your money, it is the most ridiculous over the top dumb movie with no plot or point!
B009EAO38C|5.0|The name Piano Guys is a bit of a misnomer. One &#34;guy&#34; plays the piano and the other generally plays the Cello. But they are not what you would think. They put a fresh touch to each piece they do, adding other sounds into the mix. The Cello player sometimes taps his instrument like a drum. Some songs have a full orchestra. They perform an eclectic mix of songs. &#34;Moonlight&#34; has an almost techno or 007 sound on the classic sonata.&#34;Cello Wars&#34; is a cello /Starwars mashup. &#34;Peponi&#34; is an African variation on Paradise by Coldplay. &#34;Rolling in the Deep&#34; by Adel is a nice instrumental version. They play the popular song &#34;Titaniun&#34; and the old classic &#34;Over the Rainbow/Gift to be Simple&#34; medley is nicely done. There are other great pieces as well. This album is fresh and creative where modern meets classic for a winning sound.
B009CG2YDE|5.0|This game is pretty basic but it is a pretty nice game 2 play if you are bored and need something to kill time with
B000F8O35U|5.0|The only thing I didn't like about this is the price. $50 is a little steep for a DVD, however my little girl wants nothing but this movie for Christmas so that's why I bought it.
B00081912E|3.0|I love this movie it is a great film but the version I purchased here was scratched making the watching experience not that enjoyable since at one point I had to take the movie out and clean it to see if that would help.  It was straight out of the box.  I had the same issue with another movie I purchased.  The actual movie I love it!
B00005JLKB|5.0|Buy all seasons for $9.99 each and save about $50 compared to buying the &#34;complete collection&#34;.  Just search each season and look for the $9.99 version.  It's the same as the complete collections, but cheaper.
1582406723|5.0|this book was bought as a gift. the person seemed to enjoy reading it. its a great gift for someone interested in the tv show
0547884591|5.0|The more I read of Tim's books and blogs, the more I see him as a superbly inquisitive schoolboy hell-bent on seeking out and savoring every last morsel of life. I enjoy the fact that he latches on to brief and intense periods of study and brain dumps the results onto anyone who may find it useful. That is how I learn best, that matches up to the way I have always done things, and that is why I enjoy reading his stuff.<br /><br />If nothing else, this book will teach you how to make a steak worthy of a mouthgasm. That alone is worth the price of this book. I went out to my obnoxiously-sized freezer that houses my grass-fed half-cow, pulled out a big steak, and made that buttery shalloty Jesus tears of goodness that he simply calls \\"Bavette Steak.\\" Make this and people will give you their car keys and Facebook passwords if you promise to feed them again.<br /><br />I have always loved cooking and am pretty damn good at it, but this is a whole other beast entirely. There is actually more of a slower-paced, sensual vibe about this book, which I didn't really expect, particularly because its intention is to teach you the most efficient way to get a desired meal. I can now say that I have learned the most about cooking from Ruhlman's Twenty and 4HC, and they totally turned my concept of cooking upside down. I always find it amusing how someone can whisper some small but profound detail in your ear, and it permanently alters how you think. I know this is probably making me sound like a hippy (or worse, a hipster), but it's the only way I could realistically put how this book changed my viewpoint. Now I'm on another one of my rabbit hole quests to dig into the cookbooks and dinner plates of the professional chefs featured in the book. In fact, I now have a reservation at the French Laundry and I'm probably going to fantasize about that for the next 2 months until I can get my mouth in there.<br /><br />The only thing I wish Tim expanded upon was the language learning. I found the explanation of his Japanese acquisition and auxiliary verbs a little lacking, but whatever, I have a brain and a thing called Google, so I friggin looked it up and found myself some charts. I forgive him for this because the book has \\"CHEF\\" in the title, not \\"POLYGLOT.\\" Though 4-Hour Polyglot might be a good book to write (you are most welcome for that awesome idea, by the way).<br /><br />Other things I enjoyed:<br /><br />I found the sections on hunting and pulling out a deer's guts to be fascinating and totally primal, and it was something I had never seen because I was raised in a place where nothing but coyotes and rabbits exist (no, not the future - just the desert). I also learned how to start a proper fire - which appealed to my inner prepper - and how to crack open sea cockroaches, which thoroughly grossed me out (yet the deer entrails did not, go figure). I also chortled at the Mario Batali pistol-whip quote. You will too when you read it.<br /><br />I can see that a lot of time and passion went into this tome, and I will make the assertion that there is something in 4HC for everyone to love and absorb.<br /><br />~Stephanie<br />Epic Beauty Guide *comund the explanation of his Japanese acquisition and auxiliary verbs a little lacking, but whatever, I have a brain and a thing called Google, so I friggin looked it up and found myself some charts.

B00000AOUD|5.0|Great live performance included as well. The original insert of the St Cleve Chronicle is great.  A miniature version of the album insert.
B006LSZECO|3.0|This book started out slow, then began to pick up about halfway through.  It kept my interest from that point on, but ended a bit abruptly and without a really good ending.  Did not like it as much as I had hoped based on the reviews I had read about it before purchasing it.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|I enjoyed the book, but it was not the &#34;Page turner&#34; I was expecting. However, as always, Grisham spins a good tale.

B000SW16NU|5.0|A wonderful look at a man who never thinks God is talking to him (in a world full of people who are sure they have the word of God) and yet he is the only one that lives as God would have us live.
B00005MP58|5.0|This is the best adaptation of Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice ever! Did I mention Colin Firth? Don't need to say more than that! But seriously, it is truly excellent, and if you haven't seen it, you should see this version. When PBS recently featured Jane Austen on Maserpiece Classics, they used A & E's version (this one). That has to say something.
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|Tina Fey is amazing & it is easy to imagine her reading this book to you.  I wanted to be her best friend after completing this book.  Definitely recommended.

B008AK8FHM|5.0|I have had several NDEs and all though I am a believer, I found the experiences Dr Eben Alexander had were accurate descriptions of what I have experienced on the other side and were compelling evidence for those scientifically inclined to give reports of continuation of consciousness after brain death another look!
B003ZDZ1WG|4.0|I bought this cd as a gift. I am not much of a country music fan, but I made a playlist of country music (from another's collection). The more I hear this album, the more I like it. The gift was appreciated.

B005FMZWD8|5.0|I need this product and it is very good choose, I like so much my choose and  I recommend from my friends
B004G600A4|4.0|I purchased this after seeing it in the movie theater. It is the story of Rapunzel when she escapes her tower. Entertaining. Good addition to your disney movie collection.
B0014D6PCO|5.0|Batman was never my fave, but this film made me a believer. Incredible performances all around and a fantastic trilogy.

B008Y1YKE4|4.0|I think youung kids would especially love this movie. It is funny, and batting towards a good family movie all around. Take your everyday goofball son who is the son of Santa and goes out on a journey of his own to deliver a present that was missed by mistake...this is a very heartfelt film and gives you great laughs. I'd say it definitely targets from the toddlers up to at least age 9 but I loved this movie and I'm 20! Definitely a good buy and lengthy too. I think anyone could enjoy Arthur Christmas. This should definitely put a smile on your childs face.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|Mahjong is fun and also challenges the mind of elderly users.  I like the ability to go back and try to improve my score.  Thanks for this free app.
B004IY6API|5.0|Been looking for this for a while. It was in excellent shape and came with no peoblems. I would buy again.
B004YM6JI2|5.0|The was a great deal for a complete season.  Supernatural Seventh Season is a great addition to my collection.  Thank you for such a great offer.
0439023491|4.0|If you thought 'The Hunger Games' was full of drama, a real page turner, then this one you'll read in a single sitting. Be sure though that you buy Mockingjay with it because when you reach the end you won't be able to stand the cliff hanger!
075669812X|5.0|This book looks amazing and people will be blown away by not only the content and detail inside, but it comes with a minifig!  The Lloyd Minifig is usually close to $10 on its own, and I paid around that for this book on Amazon.  It's a no brainer to purchase the book here.<br /><br />The content lists ALL of the sets, figures, etc., for the Ninjago series.  Some of the sets aren't in stores anymore, but kids will be able to see them in this book.  My son, who is seven, is in love with this book and has literally read it cover to cover over and over in the two weeks he's had it.<br /><br />If you are shopping for a great gift for a kid who loves this show and are afraid to get them a Ninjago Lego set that someone else might get them, buy this book!!!<br /><br />**Side Note:  I'd recommend if you get it for little ones, open the minifig for them because it's built into the cover of the book and they might tear the sucker open.
0670034711|5.0|This book will take you to far away lands without the need for a plane ticket. The detail and writing is beautiful and creates the image of fine are in the mind. Informative, powerful, fun, compelling. A MUST READ.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|I love John Grisham books.  A Time To Kill and Runaway Jury were favorites, but this was a good one too. Full of twists and surprises - so I got just what I knew I'd find.
B005ZOCF5E|5.0|Very fresh and inventive. I have read his entire catalog and was thrilled to see the vitality that he brings to this new universe. The characters are well drawn and the action outstanding. There is a lot of time for contemplation as we trudge through the Martian landscape or sit for coffee with an android. The ending is slam bang space opera with a lot of interesting physics and I am looking forward to part 2 which is out in 2013. Keep up the good work AR!
B0083P1QUM|2.0|I have read all of Patricia Cornwell's books.  Over the years I've gotten more and more disillusioned by the fact that her characters all have a chip on their shoulder -- people never have just regular relationships.  They all come across as angry -- someone is always trying to make Kay look bad,  Lucy is always angry and we never really know why, and Pete is a mess who has become very hard to have any sympathy for -- which makes them all unlikeable after a while.  I also thought this book spent way too much time trying to impress us with techniques rather than with creating an interesting story.  That's the trend of her books now - making sure we are impressed with what she knows about flying helicopters or that she is a gourmet cook. This book also has her lusting after a new co-working while being suspicious of her husband and one of his co-workers. Pathetic. If Kay Scarpetta went into therapy and got herself together, perhaps Cornwell could return to writing good books.
B00881PPTO|4.0|I have not tested this mobile app for a reservation yet, but it looks well-organized and very useful. I am happy to get it ad-free. What I can vouch for is Kayak's search results. As a former frequent traveler, I often found that Kayak turned up lower fares than competing sites (Expedia, Travelocity, etc.). Over recent years, most such sites have converged with the others on their feature sets (grids, alerts, etc.) and their fare comparisons. But almost every time I compare fare results, Kayak comes out best.
B0083GPDBO|2.0|A great idea for a movie, getting special powers from the alien source and some pretty good graphics, but the thing of making it look like someone was filming it with their ccamera was very very bad. disjointed, etc.
B0093QDGEO|3.0|I wasn't expecting this movie to be as good as it is.  There were only 2 moments that were groaners or WTF? moments.<br />It's an enjoyable, funny movie, that moves along well.  The plot is light, but not too simple.
B006TLFIAQ|5.0|I liked it, a lot. Lots of great action. A great bunch of actors and the locations were also great.
B009IJJB8G|5.0|This newest version of Sherlock Holmes is very fun and interesting.  The lead actors are very good, with on-screen chemistry, and work well together.  Episode plots are plausible and sometimes intricate. Added to my &#34;must see&#34; shows list.
B005V4FJC4|1.0|This must be the most disappointing Christmas album ever. Two really gifted vocalists, a great selection of songs, and just about THE WORST interpretation and arrangement of said songs I could imagine. How do you make \\"Silver Bells' grim? How do you take all the swing out of \\"Blue Christmas\\"? After Zoe's gorgeous, simple few phrases of \\"Baby, It's Cold Outside\\" in the movie Elf, I was really excited to hear her do the whole song; but it's a weird draggy interpretation with no joy in it whatsoever.
B007THA4FI|2.0|The book was just ok. It was hard to follow in the beginning with the introduction of so many characters, but the book did fall in nicely at the end.  I must say that I was  A little disappointed since the Potter books were so great.  I think J.K. needed an outlet to swear and introduce sex.

B009CVC1NC|5.0|Michael Monroe Lewis (born 1960) is a financial journalist and contributing editor to Vanity Fair; he has also written books such as  [[ASIN:B008V0C6LW Liar's Poker: Rising Through the Wreckage on Wall Street Pub in Penguin Bks 1 edition by Lewis, Michael published by Penguin Books Paperback]], [[ASIN:B003CGRL74 Panic: The Story of Modern Financial Insanity (Paperback)]], etc.<br /><br />He states in the Prologue to this 2010 book, \\"When I sat down to write my first book... I hoped that some bright kid at Ohio State University who really wanted to be an oceanographer would read my book, spurn the offer from Goldman Sachs, and set out to sea. Somehow that message was mainly lost. Six months after 'Liar's Poker' was published, I was knee-deep in letters from students at Ohio State Univerity who wanted to know if I had any other secrets to share about Wall Street. They'd read my book as a how-to manual.\\" (Pg. xv)<br /><br />He observes that \\"The presence of millions of small investors had politicized the stock market. It had been legislated and regulated to at least seem fair. The bond market... experienced no similar populist political pressure... Bond salesmen could say and do anything without fear they'd be reported to some authority. Bond traders could exploit inside information without worrying that they would be caught.\\" (Pg. 61-62)<br /><br />He records that \\"[AIG's Joe] Casssano nevertheless agreed to meet with all the big Wall Street firms and discuss the logic of their deals---to investigate how a bunch of shaky loans could be transformed into triple-A-rated bonds... The AIG FP traders present were shocked by how little thought or analysis seemed to underpin the subprime mortgage machine: It was simply a bet that home prices would never fall.\\" (Pg. 89) Later, he adds, \\"the most overpriced bonds were the bonds... that Wall Street firms had tricked the ratings agencies into rating most ineptly. 'I cannot f_____g believe this is allowed,' said Eisman.\\" (Pg. 101)<br /><br />Another trader recalls, \\"But the more we looked at what a CDO [collateralized debt obligation] really was, the more we were like, 'Holy sh__, that's just f_____g crazy. That's fraud. Maybe you can't prove it in a court of law. But it's fraud.\\" (Pg. 129) Another said, \\"They weren't satisfied getting lots of unqualified borrowers to buy a house they couldn't afford... They were creating them out of whole cloth. One hundred times over! That's why the losses in the financial system are so much greater than just the subprime loans. That's when I realized they needed us to keep the machine running. I was like, 'This is allowed?'\\" (Pg. 143)<br /><br />He notes, \\"Goldman Sachs did not leave the house before it began to burn; it was merely the first to dash through the exit---and then it closed the door behind it.\\" (Pg. 209) He concludes, \\"The big Wall Street firms, seemingly so shrewd and self-interested, had somehow become the dumb money. The people who ran them did not understand their own businesses, and their regulators obviously knew even less. [Traders] had always sort of assumed that there was some grown-up in charge of the financial system whom they had never met; now, they knew there was not.\\" (Pg. 244)<br /><br />Not quite as engaging as Liar's Poker, this is still an interesting and engaging book about the recent financial crisis.<br /><br />Another trader recalls, \\"But the more we looked at what a CDO [collateralized debt obligation] really was, the more we were like, 'Holy sh__, that's just f_____g crazy.

B00A3AUGEW|3.0|Some of the songs on this album are exactly what I would have expected to hear from Phillip, and some aren't (disappointingly so). I don't know how much say he had with this CD, but it seems the record label gave him about 50% input, when they should have gave him 100%. The album itself is very remeniscent of a Dave Mathews album BUT it sounds very much like Phillip Phillips singing. He still has a great voice and that saves some of the songs. I'm somewhat disappointed because I really wanted to love every song on the album, but just couldn't.
B00785P2QC|4.0|Fun and a bit challenging. A few too many &quot;upgrades&quot; from the first version. It's not necessary to purchase to play the game.
B00A131VJA|4.0|This CD is what a normal fan would expect from Christina. The ballads are great and most of the dance tracks are fun. There is one track that unneccessarily vulgar but other than that it's a good album.
B0064NTZQ2|4.0|\\"A different kind of action-thriller, Nicolas Winding Refn has directed a fine piece of film that combines an independent/art-house vibe to its surprisingly simple plot but intriguing soundtrack, cinematography, and characterisation. While cold/distant and off-key at parts, Gosling makes a star with a deeply involved character that is more than head-smashing and little dialogue.\\"
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I love that this syncs up with any device I have.  Christmas shopping so much easier to do with checklists!
B009NQKPUW|4.0|\\"Without being familiar with Alien, the initial reaction I received at my first midnight screening for this film was well worth it. It is the kind of film that leaves the audience boggling with questions and it all works well than probably AvP (Alien v. Predator).<br /><br />The acting was prime especially from Rapace and Fassbender. Even when some may view David as cold, it is all integral paying as a homage to HAL-9000 (2001) and his performance serves as a reminder of the future and its dependence of technology (no hints/spoiler but he is empty in one part). The somewhat minimal special effects, reasonable time length, Oscar-level cinematography, and scenery is phenomenal, better than Avatar (which ain't all that good/look over the Cameron hand-kissing hype) especially when considering everything is centrally located to one location (often touching on minimalist points than the extravagant and grand). The opening has an ethereal quality about it and its calming yet tense soundtrack all complements the mood of the film. The idea that it is a horror is quite contradictory to the film's particular core- the idea of space exploration and research into new life and signifies itself as a human futuristic thriller about the importance of ideas and peril in the face of scientific discovery. It follows along the lines of other great films, but not to the level of celebration by critics, like Moon (neat, cerebral film from David Bowie's son- Duncan Jones), The Island of Dr. Moreau, Pandorum (which is very similar), and Fantastic Planet (a classic but not-very-good animated fantasy.<br /><br />In regards to particular criticisms, the story is grand but slightly choppy involving the man behind the spaceship that Charlize Theron finds is hostile as well as the troubling figure known as The Engineer who has a rather faint significance here beginning and ending. The film does lack a sense of a stronger foundation in the opening but is forgiven with the insight into discovery of a new planet and the R rating was particularly too high for the film's rather infrequent yet disturbing images and the film feels altogether tamer compared to many R-rated films and even PG-13 films like Casino Royale and Taken.<br /><br />A newer notice is at stake with the many haters-and-lovers who view Prometheus in a mixed fashion. The film as a whole is more positive in terms of film criticism when you consider viewing it from a perspective that does not have much familiarity with the Alien franchise and/or science-fiction. Patience is best a virtue when viewing a film that is as contemplative and gradually tense as Prometheus. Give it a go, but like any film, come with an open mind!\\"a new planet and the R rating was particularly too high for the film's rather infrequent yet disturbing images and the film feels altogether tamer compared to many R-rated films and even PG-13 films like Casino Royale and Taken.<br /><br />A newer notice is at stake with the many haters-and-lovers who view Prometheus in a mixed fashion.

B008AK8FHM|5.0|The author writes this book with the intention to prove to his readers that he has made every attempt to challenge his experience thru his knowledge and experience as a doctor only to realize that there are more and more experiences by his patients that he originally dismissed and now can be seen as further proof of a heaven.
B0034G4P1W|2.0|\\"First off, this film had so much expectations- its brand recognition, animation style, quirky vibes, and British mannerisms. Surprisingly for Aardman, this has to be their weakest but most technically advantageous feature-length film since Flushed Away and The Curse of the Were-Rabbit. I am sorry to say but the film suffers from a stodgy plot, lackluster humour, an unusual fast pace, and lack of development in characterization. What makes it stand out is their signature animation style and accompanying 3D effects. Get a DVD and watch The Wrong Trousers, A Close Shave, and Chicken Run instead. Even Arthur Christmas, one of their CG works, fared better than this one in terms of story.\\"<br /><br />PRO: Strong aimation style and details. 3D effects. Choice of music. Occasional satirical/historical points (esp. Jane Austen, Queen Victoria). 3D effects.<br />CON: Structure and execution of story, themes, plot devices, and humour is flat. Pacing is typically uneven. Deceiving title and name for the British version/title (\\"In an Adventure with Scientists.\\"). Iffy marketing campaign. Action and thrill feels middling and same.
B0090YHSFC|5.0|this game had me puzzled at first, but once I figured it out it was alot of fun! It is challenging and different from your typical video games. You need hand/eye coordination as well as logic/planning insight. 5 Stars!
B00AE2IJIE|5.0|\\"After second viewing of Laika Animation's second film, the people behind Coraline and The PJs (when known under Will Vinton Studios), not only was it even better but I experienced and appreciated even more the highly intricate animation process, designs, and storyline. Even before seeing it a second time, this is by far the best film I've seen in 2012 along with Tim Burton film Frankenweenie in terms of best animated works. It is almost like 2009 where this year brought forth many interesting works on the table. So far, the best moments to recollect are the homage to 80s horror-comedies and the more subtle, mellow moments that go against the mania and frenzy shown during the riot and witch-encounter scenes. Eerie, imaginative, and audacious (in terms of horror themes and perceptions of death and its edgy Goonies-esque humour with its widely-debated jock Mitch). If ever in doubt about the field of animation, don't be harmed to give ParaNorman a try for your DVD or rental collection. You won't be disappointed, unless if you're prudish or ultra-conservative or against the so-called notion of \\"kid's entertainment.\\" Midnight film at best with Gremlins, Shaun of the Dead, or Howard the Duck on too.\\"<br /><br />CONTENT ADVISORY: Due to horror images, morbid or bleak themes, and suggestive dialogue or humour (like the infamous gay jock Mitch), parents are advised that the film may contain moments felt inappropriate for younger audiences, hence the PG rating.
B004SJ3BCI|3.0|Angry Birds Free has too many ads especially those large black friday ads and I'm sure more to come for the Holidays. The game at times seems to do what it wants and not what I want it to do.
B0098VYCCE|3.0|\\"As a spin on the Grimm fairy tale and as a stand-alone dark fantasy, it functions much more effectively on a moderate basis than the flamboyant Avatar. In terms of its premise, it functions in bringing a dark and enjoyable environment that works to separate the Disney cliches attached to the film along with some intriguing set designs, laugh-out-loud dry humour from the dwarves, landscape shots, and action featured in a clear, non-cinema verite style. Don't let the mixed reviews disorient the experience for I came in with an open mind and I thought worked better-than-expected with a touch of classic magic found occasionally in a Peter Jackson or dark Jim Henson picture.\\"
B009E3EY4M|5.0|Since I was unable to attend the concert in 2007....it's the next best thing. Sound quality is amazing on my home theater.
B000NI8F5G|5.0|\\"First viewing was not as strong as the second time when I got to know more about its groundbreaking story, special effects of the time, sense of humour, and future tie-ins with the French silent film The Artist. An intriguing and ambitious effort on the part of Donen and Kelly in coming up with this crazy yet delightful musical. Who cannot miss but the classic scenes involving him 'singing in the rain', 'gotta' dance', dancing with the scarved woman, and dancing with Cyd Charisse. All scenes accompany an already legendary and strong film even with inconsistencies and a slightly rushed and muddy third act. Above all, it is one of those American classics you cannot compromise. Even with it being hailed as one of Hollywood's best works, don't take its message seriously. The film is best seen for fun and for film aficionados alike.\\"

B0079J28NW|4.0|\\"Yellow Submarine manages to win over its surrealist, psychedelic edge with impressive and abstract visuals/animation of its time and legendary soundtrack. It is the kind of film that you watch while on drugs (but don't!). It does suffer from story/plot-based mechanics and overuse of limited visuals but the film eclipses its negative points by being what it was meant to be as a clear metaphor for The Beatles' quirky nature especially during the Sgt. Pepper Lonely Hearts Club Band era. It almost leads you to believe how much animation has to offer especially in the world of music of this calibre. As a person interested in animation, film, and experimentation, this is recommended or required viewing. I'm glad Disney did not try to distort the film's creative spirit with 3D motion-capture animation and also for not being done with much digital software.\\"<br /><br />PRO: Psychedelic and imaginative spirit. Music soundtrack. The Beatles featured throughout. Strikingly vivid and austere visuals. Special effects. No use of LSD during the showing.<br />CON: Occasionally limited use of animated visuals. Sometimes uneven storytelling techniques. Odd ending.

B00782O7IY|5.0|\\"One of the finest films of 2011 is the only film in 2012 that I have came to revisit with family. After a second round, the film still maintains its near sheer excellence as a clever and slightly twisty homage to the dead genre. Dujardin makes a convincing performance as Valentin and the film makes it all the more worthwhile with its thematic devices, mood and tone, soundtrack, lightning and scenery, film print rendering and slight grain, and mime-like humour.\\"<br /><br />P.S. Does anyone think Jean Dujardin have a Clark Gable kind of look or way about him?
1451696191|5.0|Many people think that they can watch movies and get just as much out as if they had read the book. With some books that works. This is not one of those books. Don't get me wrong the movies great, but the book is just beyond words. If you haven't read this; read it. Charlie thoughts and narrations are amazing and somehow everything he says just makes sense - even the simple things. The Perks of Being a Wallflower just.. set me free. This is the kind of book that will stick with you for years after you read it.
B008Y1YJ90|4.0|\\"Aardman's second venture into the world of CG animation is surprisingly stronger in story than Flushed Away and the fourth W&G film. It is intriguing (especially its geographical aspect), funny at parts, neatly designed and digitalized, and irreverent that makes for a good, modernized version of Frosty the Snowman or a Rankin & Bass special for the new age.\\"
B004U8VWLE|5.0|Lives up to its legend. Natalie Portman is astonishing and deserves the award she won. Twists, turns, and more. Bravo!
B005LAII12|4.0|\\"While not intended for children, Ted does not fail to impress with its ambitious concept, animation, R-rated sensibilities for a Roger Rabbit-like film, and MacFarlane-branded humour that does not fail to falter through the antics. On another side, the story and the so-so comic emotional moments work to function like a proper comedy not like a corny episode of Family Guy. Now, the modern-day jokes about Jack & Jill and Taylor Lautner and the sort of rushed ending doesn't work for a film that looks like it can stand the test of time. If you like Toy Story, which is obviously a classic, mixed with South Park: Bigger, Longer, & Uncut, and Howard the Duck, you'll love Ted.\\"<br /><br />Like the title suggests, this is an R-rated film. Most of your teens would have heard this kind of language and dialogue at school or college but if they love and aren't prone to do drugs, sleep with several people, play stab-the-hand, and cuss like a sailor, then give this gem a round on the DVD player, Netflix, etc.

B0085A9HXS|5.0|\\"Violent, gritty, well-photographed, and action-packed Indonesian thriller that has all the pack of a punch as a hardcore martial arts film and a somewhat realistic SWAT raid. Nothing sanitized here, folks, this is the kind of stuff British men love to see after going to the pub. One of the best and most exciting films of 2012 so far.\\"<br /><br />PRO: Intense, brutal/bloody action sequences. Minimalist yet grand approach. Lacks use of CG and SFX. Made even a chance in multiplexes with it in Indonesian. Themes about teamwork and strategy.<br />CON (Spoiler alert): Lacks some part toward the end with the elder and the brothers.
0547884591|1.0|Tons of fake ratings have been posted on the first day that this book came out. These are over 50 five star ratings that have never rated anything else. That is shameful, please do not encourage this type of behavior. That is all.<br /><br />I guess it isn't all, this review was quoted in the NYT Tech Section article written by  David Streitfeld. Nice to see I'm not the only one reading about this problem with reviews.<br /><br />\\"Two weeks ago, Mr. Ferriss brought out his third book, \\"The 4-Hour Chef.\\" Published this time by Amazon itself, the nearly 700-page tome came equipped with many five-star reviews posted on the date of publication. Only a few of the reviewers said they had gotten advance copies. Once again, some readers saw something suspicious. \\"Tons of fake ratings have been posted on the first day that this book came out,\\" posted a reader who goes by carmex. \\"Please do not encourage this type of behavior.\\"
B00A6PD9I4|4.0|\\"Pixar has done it again and brought somewhat of a revival to a slightly fading record of films like Toy Story 3 and Cars 2. Well, in the end, they thought the story of a rebellious young princess would be the framework of a Disney film but hasn't with its unique elements of neat and high-level graphics, not needy of a man scenario, and the historical component respectable to 12th-century Scotland. Like many Pixars, this one will always be in the conscience of someone who wants to work there. Don't fear the critics but bear in the mind that this isn't Toy Story or Monsters, Inc.-level of greatness. If you like Mulan or Princess Mononoke, you'll love Brave.\\"<br /><br />P.S. In some way or form, the film might be more interesting if having a Scottish Gaelic/Alba language track. Only enhances the experience and Pixar, from some's standpoint, wouldn't mind enhancing authenticity hopefully.
B0063IH60K|5.0|a wonderful way to pass some idle time, especially when waiting in a doctors office, etc. and it keeps the mind alert.
B009GEBBNQ|3.0|\\"Think a Thor 2 meets X-Men, The Expendables, Justice League (DC Comics rival), Watchmen, and The Incredibles. Grand, highly action-packed, and fun but rather average escapist filmfare that manages to be smart and savvy and filled with one important and appealing factor- variety! The concern here is that while there is so much to offer, the hype and excess sometimes may leave people feeling exhausted and wanting for more. Going to see The Avengers/Marvel Avengers Assemble wasn't intentional but it was just something to see at the time at the cinema. Everyone rocks on here especially Thor, the Hulk, and Captain America.\\"<br /><br />PRO: Swift and detailed action sequences. Scenes involving Thor, Captain America, and the Hulk. Inclusion of science and engineering fiction. Cinematography. Special effects.<br />CON: Lacks much in terms of a dynamic storyline. Feels average and same as a whole.
B009NQKXYK|3.0|This was a solid Sci Fi movie.  It was character driven, it had an excellent tech background, and they were trying to answer significant questions about the human condition.  It didn't get a better review because the main antagonists motivations weren't enitrely clear or believable.  I felt like the main bad guy (And the secondary bad guy) had to be the way he/she/it was because well... they needed a bad guy to do those things, or it wasn't a scary movie.<br /><br />Additionally, I was a little disappointed to see a team of &#34;scientists&#34; and &#34;professionals&#34; making really bad rookie mistakes, and having really poor judgement which led to their demise.  I think its much more interesting (and sympathetic) to see intelligent, and really competent people struggle (and perhaps come to a bad end) because the antagonists where even more clever and competent.<br /><br />The movie wasn't as full of suspense as I found Alien to be.<br /><br />On the plus sides, I thought the acting was decent, the discoveries kept me engaged, and the plot twists were interesting.
B005LLSNNE|5.0|Do you really need a review to know how awesome this show is? Season 5 i get each episode the day after it shows and its all of 1.99.
B0049P1ZZQ|5.0|A wonderful and entertaining allegory about the right-wing takeover of the Republican Party, by racist blowhards who self-identify as the \\"Tea Party!\\"
B000GDH9JQ|5.0|Although it is dated during  the cold war the dancing is excellent. It provides a view of how things were during that time for people who did not live during that time.
B008BQ8VOC|5.0|Great acting; intriguing storyline; nice character development.  Couldn't ask for more.  Surprised it doesn't get mention for awards on TV.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|This book was pretty good. Not a great Grisham book, but it was interesting.I would tell anyone to read it
1400069289|4.0|I quite liked this book.  In fact I chose to buy my coworkers their own copy.  Understanding what motivates positive/negative behavior was very informative.
B008Z9YGEE|2.0|Movie was very disappointing after reading the book.  No character development at all - you didn't feel anything for the characters.  Should have skipped the control room scenes (which were NOT in the book) and concentrated on what WAS in the book.
034580404X|5.0|Found these cheaper on here then I have in any stores!  I loves these books they are awesome! Hope they have for to come.
B004KAB43I|5.0|I have grown up watching the two movies for the Bridget Jones's Diary series. I love the movies and always have, so I decided I HAD to read the book. I loved it. Every page had something amusing, if not Jones's commentary on her calorie and cigarette intake to how she responded to different situations in her life, even in her head. Loved it! Not just a great chick-flick, but a perfect read.
B005JZBPHS|5.0|I absolutely love the look of the box and how the whole season is in one package. A great show at a great value!
B007J4T2G8|4.0|Content is hot and heavy, but good.  A bit slow to get going.  You really get into the story line more in the other books.
6305878323|5.0|Excellent price for an excellent movie. Definitely recommended for anyone looking for a good movie to watch with the family.
B004FOA84A|4.0|played this game I thought it was fun. only thing is it only took about 2 hours to complete. wish there was more to it.
B00992CF6W|1.0|I bought this app and it wouldn't even install I don't know what is wrong but I think it could be the app
B000JPRPAO|5.0|Great. Love this movie. You will never catch the real nappster. Awesome cast and story line. The video quality was also very good.
B000093FLA|5.0|I liked this movie.  And, I didn't have issues with Brad Pitt.  LIked this one better than Lock, Stock & 2 Smoking Barrels.
B004AQR29C|3.0|I liked the action, dialog was weak, plot was predictable.  Men will love it, women...not so much.  It is RED without a plot.
B0000B1OFL|4.0|I liked this movie.  Loved the minis.  Enjoyed the extras, including the driving school.  Too funny the clip between Charlize and Statham.
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|Great game to play, a lot of ads though. good for all ages. my son loves it as do i
B002ZG999U|5.0|I LOVED this movie.  I watched Rocky, Die Hard, Rambo when I was in high school.  Jet Li and Jason Statham are favorites.  Overall, better than what I ever expected!!  Can't wait to watch Expendables 2.
B0064BWDRW|5.0|Could not put it down.<br />If you have read the previous books you will love this one, if this is your first, you'll be hooked.<br />Can't wait for more.
B0063IH60K|5.0|this game is old but still the best game ever its good for the kindle fire because you could turn the screen and it goes where u go but computers dont
B008O9V4C2|4.0|\\"Sunken Condos\\" is Donald Fagen's look at getting older. He slyly refers to himself as a \\"burned out hippie clown\\" and as being \\"ready for Jurassic Park.\\" If \\"The Nightfly was his look at a nostalgic past, \\"Sunken Condos\\" is a look at how a grown-up loses the starry eyes and gets trapped in the \\"Memorabilia,\\" calling them all \\"souvenirs of a perfect doom.\\" If you think that the music should match all this, you'd be fooled, because like \\"The Nightfly,\\" Fagen is at a relaxed and jazz-funk mood. For the 64 year old Fagen, this is a spry and loose album, filled with impeccable playing yet accessible songs.<br /><br />Given my thoughts that \\"Morph The Cat\\" was inaccessibly complex for a pop-music album, the \\"Slinky Thing\\" that is this album is a delight. Fagen and his cohorts (special honors to guitarists Jon Herington and Kurt Rosenwinkle) lay down a funk groove like the best of Steely Dan's memorable songs, all while acknowledging that real musicians are playing these riffs and not some kid on a laptop (who seems to be the antagonist of \\"The New Breed,\\" where Fagen loses the girl to a techno-whiz. Or he backtracks to the days of Prohibition as he becomes a mob-runner for \\"Good Stuff,\\" making up people and places that harken back to the days of \\"Dr Wu\\" or \\"Gaucho.\\"<br /><br />Through it all, \\"Sunken Condos\\" doesn't lose the sly nods to his audience and old fans. This is most obvious on the odd cover of Isaac Hayes' \\"Out Of The Ghetto.\\" Turning a piece of super-funk into the kind of mysterio-sheen that Becker and Fagen always did best, even it's got to be one of the oddest choices for a cover he could have made. Contrast it to \\"The Nightfly's\\" rework of Dion's \\"Ruby Baby\\" for the effect of being transported out of one zone and into Fagen's world. It's a world that can't be held into the compression of MP3's or pre-processed expectations. \\"Sunken Condos\\" is a return to form for Donald Fagen and is sure a welcome pool in a desert of wiz-kids and sine-waves passing for sophisticated musicisticated music
