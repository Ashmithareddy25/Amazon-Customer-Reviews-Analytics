B003IVDPC8|3.0|I'm about 20 minutes into the DVD and cringe every time Carole King tries to sing and recreate some stage connection.  It's nice that JT and Carole are together for nostalgic reasons, but don't expect a good performance.  The sound mix is annoying as mentioned by others.   Loud drums sometimes, then the audience.  Buy the DVD of James Taylor's live concert \\"One Man Band\\" and you'll be a lot happier.  Even James Taylor's talent and voice can't save this.
B000O174CM|5.0|The movie version of Dreamgirls is a great ensemble piece. Everyone of the actors were excellent! The singing was fabulous! I've watched this movie many times. I love it every time. It's fast paced and fun. Although people say it's a biography of the Supremes, the originators have constantly said it is not. It's about a girl group rising to fame with one standing out above the others. The cast was perfect including Jamie Foxx as Curtis. He's charmingly slimy. Eddie Murphy was terrific as Jimmy Early. A man at the top of his game, totally full of himself, watching his dream of bigger stardom pass to someone else (this time a girl group) once again. Eddie Murphy was definitely not his typical comedy guy, but portrayed an out of the box showman with real talent whose demise showed a darker, deadlier side of show business.Watching the movie at home, Jennifer Hudson still gets a standing ovation. Her powerful singing voice and brash but vulnerable character gave her a role of a lifetime that definitely deserved all the awards she received. Beyonce disappeared into her role as Deena. You don't see Beyonce. You see Deena. Her beauty was mesmerizing. Anika Rose was delightful as the third Dream. Sharon Leal added classy sophistication to the Dreams. Keith Robinson as C.C. had a velvet chocolate voice. All the players, including the smaller roles, Hinton Battle, Danny Glover gave depth and class to their parts and the movie. The music flows flawlessly with the dialogue. We are so used to flawless (digital) singing today that period music might seem raw or pitchy to some. The music was real and the singers sang!
B004DMNT2W|4.0|If you are looking for a small case for just a camera and two memory cards (SD sized), this is a good choice.    It is about 6.5 inches long, about 3 inches across, and about 3 inches deep. It is designed to hold one of the beer-can style camcorders and has two small pockets on the inside to hold 2 SD-sized memory cards. The front padding is about 1/4 of an inch thick, and the padding on other three sides is about 1/8 of an inch. The back also has some stiffening to make the case more rigid. There is an elastic band sewn into the interior of the bag about halfway up the length, obviously to help secure the camera or other item being stored.    The case zippers open down the front with a good quality zipper, and has a great rubber reinforced pull which holds the pull string loop open and cushions the finger when using it. Nice design feature.    The handle is an inch wide loop of material which is secured on one end by a hook-and-loop strap, and can also be unfastened and used just as a regular wrist strap. When fastened down with the hook-and-loop strap, the case can be put on a belt or pack strap as well. I am a bit leery of trusting hook-and-loop fasteners too much, so the ability to slide a belt through the handle itself makes me feel better about carrying the case that way. It should be quite secure even if the hooks let go or are pulled apart.    The case is made of two different kinds of nylon fabric, a Cordura-type, and a shinier, slicker type. It seems quite well made and sturdy.    All in all, it is a good, solid case for minimal gear carry.

B004LGPBZI|4.0|A day in the life of brothers Noel and Liam Gallagher has more drama than a season of Glee, but they<br />still managed to keep Oasis going for about fifteen years before their creative and personal differences<br />got the better of them and Oasis, one of the most critically acclaimed bands of the last 20 years, was no<br />more. Noel Gallagher's songwriting genius gave us a handful of decade defining hits like \\"Wonderwall\\"<br />and \\"Don't Look Back in Anger,\\" but his ever-growing ego forced fellow Oasis members Gem Archer,<br />Andy Bell and Chris Sharrock to side with Liam, the younger brother, and form Beady Eye.<br /><br />\\"Different Gear, Still Speeding\\" may not have the same songwriting prowess of Oasis' glory days, but<br />thanks to Liam Gallagher's love affair with The Beatles and everything else `60's, Beady Eye manages to<br />bring back the retro British Pop feel everyone adored on the Oasis classic \\"(What's the Story) Morning<br />Glory\\" infused with a certain energy and excitement for the music that many Oasis albums since have<br />lacked. This newfound enthusiasm may be, in part, thanks to the combined songwriting efforts of Liam<br />Gallagher, Archer, and Bell who have each individually penned singles for the last three Oasis records.<br />Gallagher's trademark vocals give the music familiarity, but the band members' collective independence<br />from Noel Gallagher's dictatorship breathes new life into their music.<br /><br />Opening with \\"Four Letter Word,\\" \\"Different Gear, Still Speeding\\" leads off with one of the best displays<br />of Beady Eye's rejuvenation. Perhaps a message for brother Noel, the chorus states \\"I don't know what<br />it is I'm feeling, a four letter word really gets my meaning. Nothing ever lasts forever.\\" Fans of Oasis<br />may relate to the lyrics of Beady Eye's debut record less than if Noel had a say in them, but the music is<br />a fresh take on classic rock `n' roll.<br /><br />The upbeat tunes continue with \\"Millionaire\\" and the first official single off the record, \\"The Roller.\\"<br />Although \\"Millionaire\\" is less catchy than either of the tracks that surround it, the song offers one of the<br />most original sounds you'll hear on the album. A bit of a country twang to the guitar mixed with closely<br />doubled vocals reminiscent of most John Lennon recordings provides a pleasant break from the straight<br />forward, kick drum driven songs that make up most of \\"Different Gear, Still Speeding.\\"<br /><br />Although the whole record offers many tips of the hat to The Beatles and The Rolling Stones, none is<br />more blatant than the track \\"Beatles and Stones\\" which repeats the line \\"I'm gonna stand the test of<br />time like Beatles and Stones.\\" Sure, ballads like \\"Kill for a Dream\\" and \\"The Morning Son\\" are weaker<br />than those of The Beatles, Stones, or even Oasis, but Liam Gallagher and company offer plenty of<br />justification for the statement on \\"Different Gear, Still Speeding.\\"<br /><br />Beady Eye's debut is an album of perspective. Listeners looking for another Oasis record may find<br />themselves disappointed at the lack of thought-provoking commentary hidden in the lyrics, but those<br />willing to accept Beady Eye as an entirely different band will likely be drawn into the music. Producer<br />Steve Lillywhite, who has worked extensively with U2 among many others, still gives Liam's vocals the<br />feature, but he finds the perfect balance between each of the players. The members of Beady Eye have<br />been held to Noel Gallagher's rules for a long time, but \\"Different Gear, Still Speeding\\" is their collective<br />declaration of independence.<br /><br />Similar Artists: Oasis, The Verve<br />Track Suggestion: \\"The Roller\\"is less catchy than either of the tracks that surround it, the song offers one of the  most original sounds you'll hear on the album.

B0033AX1YG|5.0|Gary Moore was certainly one the great guitarist that is among the few one-of-a-kind talents worthy of mention with the likes of Hendrix, Clapton, Stevie Ray, Jeff Beck, etc. I own and have viewed the other Gary Moore Live at Montreux 1990 numerous times and am always blown away by his execution of hitting those additional lead notes that sets the great ones aside from the mediocre.<br /><br />Gary is one of the few artists that is equally as powerful and amazing live as what comes through in his studio recordings. Now that Gary is gone, any video of his work should be sought after for years to come as I believe his playing should be considered legendary. This DVD/CD set fills in the gaps quite well from others available.<br /><br />If you are already a fan of Gary Moore or just into great guitarists like myself, this DVD/CD set is a must and I'm sure it will be one of the DVD's you will find yourself pulling off the shelve regularly.
1439102724|5.0|FIRST SENTENCE:  One sunny, crisp Saturday in September when I was seven years old, I watched my father drop dead.<br /><br />As I sit here listening to the very mellow CD that comes as a bonus with this book (a song corresponding to each chapter), I'm still blown away by this book.  So much so that I'm ignoring my planned review schedule to let people know about it.<br /><br />The publisher's description, well, it doesn't capture this book .. at all, really.  This book is about so much more than reproductive issues or same-sex marriage or any of that. I mean, it's in there; it's the premise of the book, but ... wow ... I was totally blown away by this one.  A book that makes you laugh AND cry?  Even thinking about it afterward brings a tear or two to my eye.  A little more on the plot (and I promised myself that I wouldn't put spoilers in, because many of the happenings that really affected me would qualify as such).<br /><br />Zoe is in her forties, a music therapist married to Max, a landscaper. They both have infertility issues, and have been unable to conceive naturally.  After 4 unsuccessful IVG cycles and 2 miscarriages, they lose another baby at 28 weeks due to a placental abruption.  With other health issues that crop up during the pregnancy, Zoe is advised that it would be an extremely high risk for her to attempt another pregnancy.  When she asks if she can, Max leaves the session .. and her.<br /><br />Max is a recovering alcoholic who falls off the wagon after the divorce that he asked for.  He is living with his older brother Reid and Reid's wife, Liddy, both born-again evangelicals who attend the Eternal Glory Church, where Clive Lincoln is pastor.  Reid and Liddy have their own fertility issues and have lost five babies pre-birth.  Max and Liddy are good friends, both of them with a fondness for old B-movies, and Reid, wealthy and successful, has always been there to help Max<br /><br />Clive Lincoln runs protests against gay marriage and abortion, and when Reid and Liddy have him over to talk to Max, Max is not receptive.  Then he has an accident while driving ... DUI ... and calls the pastor.  He becomes a member of the church.<br /><br />Vanessa Shaw is a 34-year-old school counselor who has worked with Zoe before on the case of an autistic student at the school.  When Lucy DuBois, a suicidal, depressed teen whose parents attend Eternal Glory Church, proves to be beyond her reach, with parents who don't believe in psychiatry, she convinces Lucy's mother to allow music therapy.  Zoe begins working with Lucy, and a great friendship with Vanessa develops.  Shortly after Zoe goes through another health crisis, their friendship unexpectedly blossoms into something more.<br /><br />Vanessa and Zoe cross the Rhode Island state line to get married in Massachusetts, and during a talk, Zoe remembers that she still has 3 frozen embryos left; she can still have the baby she wanted so badly, only it will be with Vanessa.  When the infertility clinic tells her she will need to get a consent form from Max, she takes the form to him, knowing that it shouldn't be a problem; after all, the reason Max left her is because he didn't WANT any children.<br /><br />Max says he will think about it, and goes to his pastor with his worries about the child living in sin, etc.  (Here's one of the jaw-dropping moments):  Pastor Clive puts a bug in Max's ear about how HE should file a suit for possession of the embryos (can't tell you the rest; it would be a spoiler).<br /><br />Suddenly Wade Preston, a lawyer and evangelical Christian, enters the picture.  This will be a precedent-setting case, so as Zoe is served, dirty tricks abound, some of which made me gasp.  The media is drawn in, and Westboro Baptist Church members enter the picture as well (this is the group that protests at military funerals, saying that soldiers are dying because gays are allowed in the military).<br /><br />While Max, who apparently isn't listening to his conscience, is being used as a publicity ploy, a courtroom revelation regarding the contract with the infertility clinic crops up that could change everything.<br /><br />I LOVE Zoe's mother Dara ... how friggin' Zen she is; how much she loves her daughter ... she is just such an offbeat person, as evidence by the following exchange between her and Zoe:<br /><br />\\"My lawsuit was on Joe Hoffman's radio show,\\" I say.<br />\\"I know,\\" my mother says.  \\"I heard it.\\"<br />\\"You listen to him?\\"<br />\\"Religiously . . . pun intended.  I tune in when I'm on the treadmill.  I've found that, when I'm angry, I walk faster.\\"  She laughs.  \\"I save Rush (Limbaugh) for my abdominal crunches.\\"<br /><br />While Max (hypocritically) commits his own sins while painting himself as a moral, upstanding Christian, he's allowing others to point fingers at Zoe and Vanessa - putting them through the wringer, characterized as immoral reprobates unfit to raise a child ... a child that he knows he can't raise.<br /><br />The novel's point of view alternates, with varying chapters being narrated by Zoe, Max, and Vanessa ... with one more at the end.<br /><br />No matter how you feel about same-sex marriage or homosexuality in general (unless you're someone who starts foaming at the mouth at the thought of it), as a human or Christian, at what point do we stop moralizing and judging others?  This novel, by showing both sides of the debate, will make you think, even if you've never thought about it before.  It is a truly emotional read - you'll smile, laugh, get angry, get sad.  This book makes you FEEL .. and any story that does that is worth the read.<br /><br />QUOTES (from an ARC; may be different in final copy):<br /><br />I usually only do three quotes, but there were just too many good ones to stick to that number<br /><br />You can argue that its a different world now than the one when Matthew Shepard was killed, but there is a subtle difference between tolerance and acceptance.<br /><br />. . . it's pretty clear to me that Max has been chugging whatever Kool-Aid the Eternal Glory church is offering.  There's something just off about him - something Stepford-like.<br /><br />I don't believe you can wake up and suddenly be gay. But I do believe you can wake up and realize that you cannot spend the rest of your life without a certain individual.<br /><br />\\"This is different, Vanessa.

B003Q6D2BE|5.0|The movie \\"Red\\" was very entertaining and enjoyable.  There was a significant amount of action and the plot and story line albeit a little far fetched was engaging and kept your interest.  A nice balance was kept between all of the stars that were in the movie, none of them were slighted with the time in the movie.  Over all a good movie, action packed and one that you will enjoy....
B000JQU4TW|4.0|The digital version (free) is quite good.  There is no table of contents, but it's not really needed for this work.  I only noticed a few typos, barely enough to interrupt the read (and comparable in number and nature to a physical book).
B004L3AR0K|5.0|When I saw a preview for Love & Other Drugs, I knew I had to see this.  Jake Gyllenhaal and Anne Hathaway are such versatile actors, so I had high hopes for this film.  They played their parts perfectly and I was instantly hooked by the story.  It's funny, heartwarming and extremely entertaining.
B003UCPEJ2|5.0|I am largely in agreement with the reviews that gave this set five stars.  I was a little worried, given some of the reviews, that some of the CDs might not work, or be blank.  I do not have SCAD capability, so that did not make a difference to me. I have played at least part of each of the 60 CDs, and they all have worked for me.  I am writing a review to try to counter a couple of bad ones I have seen on here.    When I was a kid living in a rural area in the 1960s, my family inherited a bunch of reel to reel tapes my grandfather had collected, which included a number from this set. While I have not seen or heard some of these recordings for 35 years or more, some of these were the reasona I first got into classical music. (Those reel to reel tapes were a lot of work though!)  While it has been fun and nostalgic to see those album covers again, mostly I just can't get over how good most of these CDs sound.  It is amazing to me that given the rather primitive recording technologies available when compared with today's capabilities, how they were able to get such good initial recordings.  Since some of these performances are historic and as good as we are likely to ever get of some of these pieces, it is really fortunate that they are now available and restored such that the audio quality of the recording is not an issue, at least for me, in deciding which version of something to listen to. All I can say is that those RCA engineers back in the late 50s and early 60s must have been amazing.  While this current restoration is very very good, I doubt it could have been accomplished had the original recordings not been as good as they were when initially made.     I would also like to comment on the packaging and how cool I think it looks, and how user friendly it is for such a large number of CDs, when compared to a lot of box sets I have or have seen. The accompanying booklet contains a great amount of information and a lot if not all of the original liner notes.  Itwould be too much to single out any particular CDs, except to say that none are bad, and a lot of them are exceptional.  This was no small project to produce, and I think it deserves a big hats off.  I only wish such a great collection were available for some of my other old favorite non RCA recordings, at such a reasonable price.

For example, he details the recruitment of Friedman, and then skips three years ahead to the recording of CTE, I'm sure Mustaine had quite a bit to say about the actual recording of RiP and the subsequent touring, but it isn't mentioned at all.

B0042RUMEQ|5.0|Now this is a review from someone who literally just listened to the album and who had never even heard of Nicki before today. That might sound strange but I tend to stick with the stuff I grew up with Pac, Biggie, Jay, Eminem and a few others. I saw that Em was on a song so I listened. I liked it. So I tried the rest of the album. This is not strait lyrical Hip-Hop but if you enjoy talent, catchy hooks and better than average flow this album is great. Hip-Hop snobs will get up in arms because well the kind of hip-hop they enjoy just doesn't appeal to a large audience and in some ways is musically very bad. This album may be heavy on pop but it is also heavy on creativity and pure musical talent. If you don't at least find a few songs on this album you enjoy then I think you must not really enjoy music and would probably be better served reading poetry at the corner coffeehouse for an occasional free cup.

B000IYV1ME|2.0|If you like movies like Winter's Bone, No Country for Old Men and etc, this is probably for you. I hate movies that are too slow. While it has a pretty good script, the director forget that movies are meant to be enjoyed by viewers. You may like this movie but I don't.
B001AQT0ZO|5.0|I am not used to watching movies with Shakespearean dialogue. It was weird. Funny even. But I had to enable subtitle to read what they were talking about. It took me a few millisecond to process what was being said. But as a whole, the movie is actually really nice. Very good \\"acting\\" too. Bluray quality is awesome.

0670022411|5.0|I read a lot. I mean, A LOT.  If I'm not engulfed in a good book I get antsy, so when I read about ADOW in a People magazine review I thought \\"sa-weet!  I gotta get it!\\".  I downloaded the ebook (I agree the price was a little steep) as soon as I could and just devoured it.  I read during any free second I had - in the grocery store line, waiting for a train to pass, you get the idea.  There is quite a bit of science and history, and frankly it could have used a little more sex (not enough to make it, like, smut, but if you read the book you'll get what I mean), but that was something that made the book even more interesting.  Someone mentioned that it was part DaVinci Code, part Harry Potter and part Twilight.  I think that was pretty on point.  Now onto something else to occupy my time until the follow-up book comes out!

0060936223|5.0|Well, hundreds of people have already rated this book, but I wanted to add yet another 5-stars to the pot. I enjoyed this book perhaps as much as any memoir I've recently read. I will admit I knew little more about Patti Smith than her 70s pop hit, \\"Because the Night.\\" Now I know she was first a poet and an artist before she cracked the ranks of rock'n'roll. Knowing that, I probably should not have been surprised at her eloquence in this volume, her memories of being young and in love in NYC in the 60s and 70s. Because this is a book that is, quite simply, beautiful in its language. Smith's portrait of her two-decade friendship and yes, love affair, with artist/photographer Robert Mapplethorpe is an exquisitely tender and nostalgic one, and yet also clear-sighted and realistic. RM was perhaps best-known for his pornographic images of the S&M and rough trade homosexual life. Smith knew all of this, and she admits she couldn't completely understand this dark side of her one-time lover (and former Catholic altar boy), but her descriptions of their long and deep friendship, and especially of Mapplethorpe's final illness and death from AIDS are, in the end, enough to break your heart. Say what you want, JUST KIDS is, more than anything else, a love story.<br /><br />There's a lot of name-dropping here, which might annoy some people, I suppose. But I loved all the connections here - the early days of 60s artists and bands, obscure and famous - The Holy Modal Rounders, Television, Blue Oyster Cult, Todd Rundgren, Andy Warhol, Sam Shepard (one of Smith's lovers for a time) and others. It was undeniably a magical time in pop music and the arts, and Smith's story gives you a fascinating hard-scrabble worm's-eye view of it all. A terrific book, that deserves the NBA for non-fiction it won. I suspect it will be around for a long time.
0307386171|3.0|Don't recommend this book to your mother.  It's 1962 England, and two virgins, Florence and Edward, have just begun their honeymoon in a resort inn.  Somehow their marriage has, in their minds, plunged them into adulthood and freedom, following their chaste, almost Victorian-style romance.  However, from a sexual standpoint, Florence is completely unprepared and disgusted by the thought of penetration.  Edward, on the other hand, has refrained from self-pleasuring for a week, which, for him, is a lengthy abstinence.  He is beside himself with lust, but some of his crude pre-marriage advances caused weeks of sulking on Florence's part, so that he is understandably cautious.  This book is so short that it's hard to say much without giving away the climax, pun intended.  Suffice it to say that there's a major communication breakdown between these two, perhaps reflective of their socio-economic gap.  Florence is an ambitious violinist from a chilly but wealthy family, while Edward has had a rural upbringing and is somewhat directionless and volatile.  I'm not sure what the author is trying to say here, except that perhaps Florence is more buttoned-up and Edward more emotionally transparent because of their backgrounds, but I don't really think those stereotypes lend much to the story.  More to the point is that they both seem to suffer from the common delusion that their partner is a mindreader.  Certainly they have not yet learned that marriage means constantly having to say you're sorry while you gulp down your pride.
B0021L8V0M|3.0|High octane action galore but the story is uneven and even unsatisfying in certain parts.  Flashbacks to the love story give the tale some texture but it's not enough.  Jolie isn't very believable to me as an action hero when she starts going hand-to-hand with people bigger than her (maybe if she did judo instead of direct attacks) which takes away from believability for me.  I would only recommend this if you like action scenes over story or you just like looking at Jolie's pretty face.  DIALOGUE/CHARACTERS: C plus to B minus; STORY/PLOTTING: C plus to B minus; ACTION SCENES: B plus to A minus; OVERALL GRADE: B minus; WHEN WATCHED: February 2011.

Amazing at home, in the car, in the gym, wherever! The track featuring In Flames is reason enough for a purchase, but luckily the rest of the tracks kill as well. Buy now, you won't regret it!

B003R0LBVW|5.0|This was my first Kindle book, and I enjoy the reading apparatus very much.  I first heard of this book on Oprah's show, and as usual, when Oprah recommends a book, I know that it must be a good read.  Freedom was beautiful and engaging. I could not put the book down until I finished reading it. I will definitely read more of Jonathan Franzen' books.
B003R0LBVW|1.0|I am total bewildered as to why so many reviewers recommended this book. Guess someone bought someone off. I was very disappointed but struggled to finish the book just in case it would end with some redeeming quality, it didn't so was a total waste of time.  My recommendation? Don't waste your time. Way over priced and over rated.
B003V1WTMM|5.0|When I started reading this book, I was looking for a great romance, instead it turned out to be the story of a sad  and lonely life.  Those three sisters, how else could their lives have ended?  They were too old for living, and could only hope to die on their own terms.  That was sad but beautiful.  I did not expect the story to end any other way. Well written, I did not just like the forwards and backwards that happened frequently.  In the end it all connected. I look forward to reading more of Kate Morton's books.

B001UV4XFG|2.0|Many classic films have had sequels that were more successful than the original: Godfather II, Star Wars The Empire Strikes Back, Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom, and Lord of the Rings Return of the King.  However, the makers of Twilight: Eclipse decided to do away with such comparisons and made the exact same film a third time.  Yippee.  3 down, 2 more 'films' left.  Keep strong everybody.
B001M5UDGS|5.0|The cast are colorful, the director is amazing, and the overall story is (though sad) fantastic. Niel Patrick Harris delivers a quirky, lovable Villain, Felicia Day plays a quirky-but-not-as-quirky girl and Nathan Fillion portrays an arrogant, meat-headed Hero. I had actually seen the movie before realizing it was Joss Whedon's, and that just made it all the better.

0316017922|4.0|This is a wonderful book, but you may only need to read the first half. It gets really repetitive and he makes the same points over and over. Otherwise, I feel like I learned a lot and got a great, new perspective.
0316044695|3.0|The men in this story and the rest of our military are heroes that deserve all the thanks and praise we can give.   Remarkable men.     I am sad that such remarkable men were sent on such a poorly planned mission.     I had to stop reading.  I felt like they never had a chance and the military gambled with their lives.     An important book if only to point out the unfathomable cost of war.

1932100660|5.0|It all started with Dr. Joel Fuhrman's Book - Eat to Live: The Revolutionary Formula for Fast and Sustained Weight Loss from there I ordered the book he wrote before<br />it - Fasting and Eating for Health: A Medical Doctor's Program for Conquering Disease.  I ordered the hard covers because I reread them and used gluestick to<br />add cloth ribbon to inside the back cover and use as bookmarks.<br /><br />Dr. Fuhrman referred to The China Study in his books so I went to the source and have read it once and have started over for the another read.<br /><br />Wow!  America, I am disappointed in how we are so corrupt that our food pyramid is based on politics not science.  Essentially eating like Adam and Eve is the road to great health.<br /><br />Our health care system is failing and getting impossible to afford.  We are getting bigger and sicker and the doctors and hospitals simply can't make money if we just use nutrition to<br />avoid/reverse disease.  I like to see all situations in a positive light but I am angry that there are doctors out there that try to spread the word and treat patients using<br />good nutrition that are silenced due to greed.<br /><br />I am buying this book to give to family and loved ones and hope they are as encouraged as I am to spread it's message.
0060775858|5.0|As a children's book author and mom I admire the writings of Margaret Wise Brown for years. Margaret created one of the most beloved children's book that has held a special place in our hearts. I remember reading this countless times to my girls when they were younger. I think it's a timeless story and helps young children feel more comfort before bedtime. I know with my youngest daughter she had fears of the dark and bed time was anxiety provoking for her. We had to read Goodnight moon each night. Both my girls loved looking at all the little details in the pictures and finding and saying goodnight to all characters and objects in the book. They especially enjoyed the goodnight nobody page! What a clever ending to a creative bedtime story. It's a must have for any young child!
0385341008|4.0|This is a cleverly written, sentimental story about the effects<br />of World War II on a very specific group of people.  The value of<br />human ingenuity is highlighted, as well as the ability of people<br />who suffer to move past their suffering and create new lives.<br />Charming.  Moving.  A very good read.  A study in human nature.
B00164KYV4|3.0|Reminding me of the American version of \\"Love, Actually\\", this film is a pleasant way to spend a couple of hours. It is a montage of a number of well-known, good actors playing out romantic entanglements that don't even begin to challenge their talent. But never mind that - it's a sweet little film.
B0016OOS16|5.0|I purchased this a little while back on a whim, and have not regretted this since. I use this with Lightwave 3D for quickly navigating the around in the scene. It's also great for animating the camera, giving your camera that \\"handheld\\" look. Highly recommended.

B00127RAJY|5.0|I bought this product a few months ago and at first was a little intimidated so I had a slow start. After a 2 weeks of using the DVD I started to see amazing changes in my posture, energy, on the scale and #1 a change in my confidence.

030726999X|5.0|I finished the first two in no time at all.  Then I went after the \\"Hornet's Nest\\" which I obtained from Amazon. All the characters were there and they led me around the Swedish countryside. The list of individuals was fantastic and the parts they played, their characterizations and names brought memories of  Swedish colleagues in my field. It was a romp that only Stieg Larsson could create.<br />My only regret was when I finished the last page. Then  my wife picked it up and her adventure began.
B002P4VUMQ|5.0|As everyone else surely says, \\"Jason is an awesome talent\\", and just a great guy as well.  The kind you'd like to hang out with.  This DVD is great, but so is the DVD included with We Sing, We Dance, We Steal Things, although it is less impressive in it's recording quality, cinematography, and venue choice.  There is something very cozy about the \\"club\\" look of We Sing DVD, more up close and personal too.  Just buy both, you'll be glad.
0743270754|5.0|A simply brilliant history of the political rise to power of Abraham Lincoln contrasted against those who were his adversaries, would eventually run against him in the election of 1860, or supported his opponents. All would eventually be part of his cabinet. It concentrates on the four main characters who would were his competitors and adversaries then eventually his allies; Chase, Bates, Seward and Stanton. While normally I'm not a big fan of political histories, the storytelling ability of Doris Kearns Goodwin is so successful that I thoroughly enjoyed the entire book. The narrative flow is easy to follow, well paced for the more casual reader but is still insightful and thoughtful in it's evaluation of Lincoln as a great mediator and team builder. Very happily recommended for those with any interest at all in American history.

B003UBTX72|5.0|This book is written in a very colloquial manner, as if you were  sitting with Richards and drinking Jack Daniel's with him while he   detailed episode after episode of his fascinating (no exaggeration!) life.    This is the kind of life people make movies of - crazy and amazing !
B002ZG98LO|3.0|OK, now I saw this movie on opening night in theaters and my first reaction was WOW what a ride!! Then I watched it again, bought it on DVD and noticed the more I keep watching it, the more flaws I'm noticing. I mean, the first time I saw it I was just happy to see a new Predator movie, I've been a fan since the first came out and ever since I've been reading and collecting the comics and watching the movies and even made a couple fan edits for my own personal use of the AVP movies. Now with that said what was so disappointing with this movie and why does it get worse each time I watch it? Well because for 1 this movie tries so hard to be the original when it's not and second of all this is a sequel, but most the time it feels like a remake. I liked the cast, I liked the idea of a game preserve on an alien planet, but the planet hardly even looked alien. This movie is very unoriginal and honestly as much as Paul Anderson's theatrical release of AVP bugged me, it doesn't bug me as bad as this one. At least Anderson tried something original and being PG-13 or not, AVP brought more to the table than this movie. I'm sorry Rodriguez, but as a die hard Predator fan, your movie does not live up to the hype you tried to give it. Predator 2 is 100 times better and more original then this movie and as much as I want to like Predators, it just feels average!  Okay, enough of the bashing now, let me get to the good things.... The first fire fight at the Predators camp, the cast, the predator hounds all though I do feel they were used way to little, they could've been a great addition to the movie, but the attempt to introduce them kinda fell flat.. Okay more good things... The show down with the Death Row inmate, the sword fight and the Classic Predator vs Berserker Predator fight and the final showdown. Still all the good stuff fell flat because those scenes felt rushed... All the talk of Super Predators, there are no super predators in this movie, if you're a Predator fan andyou want to see a Super Predator, watch AVP-R, fast forward all the teen drama, turn up the brightness, or do like me, make your own edit of the movie and watch Wolf in action, now he is a Super Predator. These predators are just as novice as the ones who got killed so quick in the Paul Anderson's AVP movie.. Sorry for offending anybody who might've liked it, but this here is just my opinion. 3/5 or 7/10 is how I rate this movie, just above average and that's me being nice because I'm a big predator fan...

B000BW7QWW|5.0|If ever there was a series due for continuation, it would be Firefly. This amazing show suffered from a string of circumstances that caused it to be cancelled even before all of the filmed episodes of it's first season had aired. This didn't stop it from developing an enormous cult following. The dedication of these loyal fans, dubbed \\"Browncoats,\\" contributed to the release of a follow-up film, \\"Serenity.\\" These same fans, their numbers boosted over the years, have risen up again to resurrect the series. Please, if anything is sacred, Bring Back Firefly!!
0756404738|5.0|Rothfuss did it again with this book. It is my opinion, and the opinion of many others, that Patrick Rothfuss is the greatest author of our time. This book is definitely worth the read. If you have time for one fantasy novel this year, make it this one, and you will agree.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Firefly was an amazing show that never really had a chance to shine. It was aired out of order, had little to no advertising, and had it's time-slot changed partway through it's run. This caused the series to be cancelled without all of it's already filmed episodes being aired. But this didn't stop it from developing an enormous cult following, whose lobbying efforts contributed to the release of the follow-up film, Serenity. These loyal fans, dubbed Browncoats, have risen again to demand that Firefly take flight again! So we ask you, PLEASE bring back Firefly!!
B000E0VKXW|5.0|We bought this movie for my daughter when she was born.  When she was bout 1.5yrs old she really started to like it. She would want to watch it every day.  She couldn't talk yet but she would place her finger to the side of her nose like Dick Van Dyke does at the beginning when he says, &#34;punc...tu...ality&#34;.  For some reason she loved that part.<br /><br />The opening of the DVD menu was also a treat for her watching the big coat rack come out of Mary's bag.  She would exclaim, &#34;Whooaaa!!&#34;.<br /><br />Now, she doesn't watch it every day, but when she does watch it she likes to sing all of the songs.
B004FP1WX0|2.0|Well I didn't waste 90 minutes, but I'm not sure I would recommend it to anyone else.  It was an interesting story, but at the end I felt that I was given nothing over the expected result of anyone who has ever been on these sites.
B003O86FMW|4.0|It seems to me that the most difficult thing about writing a trilogy must be in striking a coherent balance between the three books.  Too often it seems as if the trilogy is actually written up as one very long novel and then broken up into three parts almost as an afterthought resulting in all three books feeling entirely too dependent upon each other to ever feel like strong individual novels.  The Hunger Games trilogy is not in any way exempt from this problem, but it does manage better than most.<br /><br />In general, Catching Fire is a faster-paced and inevitably more rewarding read than the first novel, as it concentrates much more on giving life and depth to the number of secondary characters both new and old as well as continuing the excellent world-building begun in the first novel without spending a lot of time re-hashing old information.  As before, the story is told solely from Katniss' point of view and thus the motivations and goals or other characters are shrouded in mystery throughout which lends a great deal of tension and suspense that wouldn't be there otherwise. As with the first novel, however, the book also struggles a bit because of Katniss' limited pov which doesn't allow for much development of any characters that she does not directly interact with for extensive periods of time. Never is this weakness more evident than in the development of Gale as a character and the subsequent weakness of the romantic sub-plot. Fortunately, as this sub-plot is not the primary focus of the novel, this doesn't detract to heavily from the novel as a whole, but the book is always at it's weakest when it lingers on Katniss' conflicted feelings for Peeta and/or Gale as a result.<br /><br />Another place where Catching Fire falls down a bit is in it's role as the second book of a trilogy. As is often case with the second novel of a trilogy, Catching Fire often feels like the first part of a larger novel rather than as a solid novel in its own right.  It spends a great deal of time setting up a lot of plot threads most of which, in the end, haven't quite come together thus merely serving to set the stage for the final novel in the trilogy. Consequently, it often seems as if you're seeing the best the series will have to offer without any clear resolution on any of it.<br /><br />All that said, Catching Fire is a hell of a fun read with an fantastic mixture of adventure, romance and intrigue.  The themes, while mature, are never so mature that I would feel uncomfortable in recommending the series for teenagers as well as adults.  Overall, I found Catching Fire to be well worth both my time and money which is a lot more than I can say about most books these days.  If you've read [[ASIN:B002MQYOFW The Hunger Games]], I highly recommend picking it up.a great deal of time setting up a lot of plot threads most of which, in the end, haven't quite come together thus merely serving to set the stage for the final novel in the trilogy.

B0041T4ML4|1.0|I did like the \\"idea\\" of this story but the actual story itself was flat and boring. Reading this book was a chore so it took me so long to get through it. I think this could have been a wonderful story if the characters were a little more likeable, some of the references to things were explained better (like I wasn't 100% sure that a windup girl was a term for a genetically produced person until the end. I was thinking she may have been part robot. The kink springs could have been explained more. I mean how does a boat run on a spring alone?) and if the author would have not used Thai words and phrases throughout the book. I got tired of looking them up so I'm not sure what part of this book was even supposed to be saying.<br /><br />I can't recommend this book. It was one of the worst I have ever read. The only character in this book that I cared the least bit about was Mai and she wasn't even in it very much at all. I felt sorry for her but I really could have cared less if the rest of them died.
B001EC2IXK|5.0|Cool Hand Luke.. Certainly the best of it's kind; placing on raw full display, in masterful style, strength, along an incredibly simple and grounded storyline. Incredible acting by all. Brilliantly written dialog. Movie made for Newman. A timeless classic movie. Can watch this movie 20 times, just as good, every time. One of rare few movies that feeds a person's spirit. The lessons? There are many.
B00427X9WI|3.0|`Eat, Pray, Love' is an average film with a decent message and as I haven't read the book I can only review this film based on it's own merits, rather than comparing it to the message the book imparts.<br /><br />This film follows Liz (Julia Roberts) after she divorces her husband and travels to Italy, India and Bali as she tries to find some meaning in her life.  She learns about herself, makes some friends and has some amazing experiences, like travel will often do for anyone.<br /><br />I hate to say it, but this film is overly sentimental and whilst the basic message is a good one (being true to yourself and finding god within you) this film feels like it has to spell it out for you as if you are stupid and can't grasp the message being rammed down your throat at every turn.  This may sound harsh and I don't mean it to, as this is perfectly watchable and entertaining, but I don't know why film makers feel the need to dumb things down to such a degree that they almost insult the viewers intelligence.  The `meaningful' voice-overs spelling things out particularly started to grate by the end of the film.<br /><br />Roberts is pretty average in this film and Bardem is probably the best of the actors here.  Saying that, Richard Jenkins is very good as well and deserves a mention.  The direction is ok and is certainly very glossy and shows the countries off to spectacular effect (like a glorified tourist advert for each destination), but it lacks a certain depth and, like the film in general, it feels rather superficial.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong, this film is good enough and certainly has something to offer, but it has no nuance and isn't as `deep' as it likes to think it is.  The book may be a whole lot better, but judging this is on it's own merits I'd say this is a good but not great film and it is worth a watch; just don't expect too much and you should be fine.<br /><br />Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page.
B001EL6EHC|5.0|I can't imagine anyone feeling something is missing in this box set of \\"Casablanca\\". It's simply wonderful.  The commentary is great, and so is the disc of extras. You even get a luggage tag and other little goodies. Sit back and enjoy the film.

B001AUKUTU|4.0|The cd starts with an hallucinating  keyboard sound that opens the first track \\"night people.\\"All of Dio's elements of  sorcery, imagination and  top notch heavy metal are there. The solos are challenging but melodic and the structures of the songs are inspiring. There might be some weaker moments in songs like \\"I could have been a dreamer\\".....maybe. It is not a rocker or a ballad. It is a very reflective song. But all in all it is classic Dio. No apologies and go - for  - the  - throat metal. it does not have the five star treatment due to the couple of weak moments as stated before. But all in all if you are into Dio....You Dream Evil!

B002MQYOFW|4.0|At its most basic, [[ASIN:0439023521 The Hunger Games]] is about a group of children being forced into a game of survival in a hostile environment where they are required to eliminate the competition in order to survive.  Thus, at its most basic, it is not all that different from [[ASIN:1421527723 Battle Royale: The Novel]] which is really what interested me in reading it in the first place.  That said, once you get past that basic premise the two are very different books though both are really quite excellent.  Like Battle Royale, however, this really isn't the sort of book that will be everyone's cup of tea.  If the basic premise turns you off, this probably isn't the book for you no matter how good I or anyone else says it is.  Because, as the premise suggests, the action is occasionally pretty brutal, the themes are quite mature and not everything is going to turn nicely and not everyone is going to survive.  That said, it's a damn fun read packed with plenty of drama, action and suspense and well worth your time if dystopian fiction with a survival beat is your thing.<br /><br />The Hunger Games takes place in a dystopian future where a single city called the Capital is the seat of government and rules over the twelve districts and the people within them.  The people of the districts are incredibly poor and often starving, forced to spend their lives in the service of the Capital through the production of goods and by laboring in the industry which is the specialty of their particular region.  Many years before the beginning of [[ASIN:0439023521 The Hunger Games]] there was a 13th district which attempted to overthrow the Capital and was summarily destroyed.  As a reminder of the Capital's overwhelming strength, two children from each remaining district are selected to participate in the annual Hunger Games, a game of survival from which only one child of the twenty-four participating will return alive.<br /><br />The first in a trilogy, The Hunger Games works surprisingly well all on its own.  So much so that the remaining two books in the trilogy are more a pleasant surprise than a necessary part of the overall story.  That said, if you enjoyed it as much as I did, you'll almost certainly be excited to dive into the next book to discover the fallout of the events of The Hunger Games.<br /><br />There is a great deal in The Hunger Games to love as the world-building is solid and the pacing, while a bit slow in the beginning, quickly steps up as the contestants for the games are chosen and the real action begins.  Action which is tempered with intrigue as the games are portrayed as being not only a way to keep the Districts in line, but also as the height of entertainment for the citizens of the Capital.  There is a lot of pomp and circumstance that leads up to the actual games which adds an interesting dynamic to both the games and the characters participating in them.<br /><br />As the story is told strictly from a single point of view, that of Katniss of District 12, the development of secondary characters does suffer as Katniss takes very little notice in people she isn't readily invested in.  That said, the entire story being told from her POV does help ratchet up the tension and suspense since the motivations of several other major characters are never entirely clear. As a result what might otherwise be a weakness seems a fair trade-off especially in this first novel where there is so much else going on that knowing too much about the supporting cast might just bog things down.  I imagine it will become a larger issue going forward, but for now it's a pretty minor complaint about an otherwise awesome book.ly well all on its own.

B00005YU1O|5.0|After a few friends suggested I watch this movie, I was blown away. It is a truly great movie. The animation style is awesome and interesting (same style as a Scanner Darkly, which was also done by Linklater.) It explores the concept of reality and dreams. Are in a sense sleep walking through life or dream walking. This is a movie that you should watch multiple times to soak in all the gems prevalent throughout. It's a great foray into different types and topics of philosophy. Be warned if you don't like philosophy or philosophical conversations, this movie isn't for you (As one reviewer didn't like the philosophy \\"Shoved down his throat\\"). It is alot to take in at first and worth the repeated viewings.
B004NYQYNQ|5.0|From start to finish this album is a testament to what good music should sound like.<br /><br />Crisp, poignant, vulnerable, melodic and soulful.  You can tell Adele crafted this album carefully because such attention to detail is paid.  Personally I haven't seen songwriting of this caliber in popular music in a long long time.  She is a throwback to a time when artists wrote poetry to music and people could relate in their own lives making this album, in my opinion, an instant classic.<br /><br />From the thumping beats indicating a sense of urgency in \\"Rolling in The Deep\\" to the whispful and pulsating landscape of \\"Set Fire to The Rain\\" to the BRIDGE.. THE BEAUTIFUL BRIDGE in \\"One and Only\\".. the kind of chord change/structure that gave me goose bumps the first time I heard it.. to the loungy rendition of The Cure's \\"Lovesong\\" and the heartbreaking and deeply personal \\"Someone Like you\\" Adele takes you on a journey with her.  This is the album you put on and live your life to.  The kind of album you put on to garner inspiration and ultimately, heal.<br /><br />This is the kind of album that can mend a broken heart.  And I would like to thank Adele for breaking through where many other artists have tried and failed.  Personally I didn't care for \\"19\\" all that much but \\"21\\" has made me a fan forever.<br /><br />&lt;3
B004PGNB1K|5.0|There are so many reasons why this book is worth reading. I could mention the stunning breadth of the Rothfuss imagination. The scope of the racing plot. The muted horror you'll feel that only worsens as you veer wildly from an intimate perspective of a passionate, intense young Kvothe to watch the terrible 'cut-flower' quality of the man he'll become, a man who's patiently waiting to die. But there's only one reason that's really worth a damn in the scheme of things.<br /><br />It's a dastardly good story.<br /><br />So many people have commented on how this plot sprawls around, how it seems lumpy and tangled and simply messy. Every writing style has it's pros and cons, so I agree, it is not neat, but I think you really just have to enjoy the journey that Rothfuss is taking you on. If the places where Kvothe journeys to and the adventures he experiences are only possible through this monstrously growing plot, then I say its worth it. The transitions between places are not as awkward as some people make it seem, but really, while I am very much hoping the third book will tie up the myriad loose ends, I'm going to say I've already been satisfied where this particular book is concerned.<br /><br />The world building, particularly the culture of the Adem was mesmerising to me. I LOVED that particular place, frankly speaking this is where I felt spellbound, where I felt I was being taught something of human nature, where I was given a display of his remarkable insight into what western culture is and is not...<br /><br />Plus it's so funny in places.<br /><br />Definitely worth reading.
B002ZCY7PU|5.0|Got hooked on Chuck while I was deployed with the USAF.  We had up through season 2 available to us, so had to order this as soon as I got back home.  Not quite as fun as the first two seasons, but I have faith the writers will bring back the fun in season 4.
B000YDG5W0|4.0|Just received these boots and am happy with them so far. They seem well made and look good with jeans or other casual pants. I read the reviews and ordering a size smaller than what you normally wear is good advice. These boots are a size smaller and fit perfect. I would recommend these boots...
B002N5N4MG|5.0|This is one of my favorite comedies on TV because it makes me feel like I'm not alone in being a huge nerd. Sure, you could complain that the characters reinforce the general nerd stereotype, but really, that makes it easier for viewers to engage and feel some familiarity with the characters. I particularly like the evil Wil Wheaton character, where he plays a diabolical version of himself. What I like about this Blu-ray version is the extra interviews and the tour of the set. I love the little extra peek into how they make it.
B000KF62MK|5.0|This DVD originally came attached to X2 I believe. I was expecting another behind the scenes docu about the film franchise. Boy was I surprised! This DVD has nothing to do with the films! This has to be the most in debth feature about the X-Men comic book franchise in existance! If you are an X-Men comic book fan, you gotta get your hands on this DVD!!
1599218011|5.0|This is a fantastic book.  The book Crazy, Sexy, Diet is just that and more.  It gently promotes a seemingly crazy life change that leads to a sexy and more confident you.  The diet part is researched well, through Kris's experience and scientific proof.  It was easy to read and was hard to put down.  I was a vegetarian before reading this book and now practice a plant-based, vegan diet; I think it is beneficial for anyone looking for an uplift in life and recommend it whole heartedly!  I've already purchased it for two other people in my life.  :)
B0007Y89ZM|5.0|What an amazing group the Eagles are.  This was my 1st item purchased from Amazon.com and I am extremely pleased with the quick delivery, packing and especially the price.  I love the Eagles, had seen this DVD before and now proud to own it.
B00402FGEE|1.0|I live in Australia and purchased the Stargate Universe Blu Ray Version. On arrival it is Region A and not suitable for Australia.  I did not see anywhere on the ordering or website order that it would be unsuitable. Frustrating as it is useless to me and now sits in a cupboard gathering dust. Be awre as I think Amazon should have highlighted the unsuitability. Sending it back is too much hardwork so I have wasted the cost of the purchase and will be sticking to buying in Country in Future.  This is the first time I have have been disappointed with Amazon
B004PGAQMW|5.0|This movie kept us laughing.  It has a great message and also a bunch of twists and turns.  We loved it.  We purchased it thru the digital download so we can begin a digital library.  So far, next to Netflix, we are loving the download option.
B0028MBKVG|2.0|while the bookjacket is alluring, i was often disappointed with mcdougalls excessive exxagerations, hyperbole ad other unnecessary details. only a small portion of the book is actually about the tarahuamara.  i was quite disappointed with the authors many embellishments presented as fact but were quite obviously not so.
030746363X|5.0|After reading the 4-hour workweek, I learned about Tims plans to create a new book: the 4-hour body.  Before it was out I pre-ordered the book and have not been disappointed. It's a clear, concise book, not feeding you the lies and verbal diarrhea that we have been fed over the last decades: no meat, brown bread, exercising for hours, the g-spot, etc.     Much like his first book, Tim tells you how things work and, more important, how you can get results. All based on experimentation and communication with similar minded people. After reading it I bought 4 more copies to give to friends 'who need it'.    Tim, thanks.
B003HC8I5M|3.0|How about you going back to the 70s and some progressive rock? You know- the music you played a big part in creating. Why do you do the motown scene- makes no sense. It's been done far better by those that were part of it. You aint part of it Phil. Sometimes I don't understand musicians- i.e. Pebozo and his Weird Al daze.
0547258305|5.0|I started reading Graceling because a colleague said he had heard it was good. I will admit, at first I was a little unsure at how much I would like it...

B002ZG98C8|5.0|\\"Machete\\" is easily the best movie of 2010 I've seen. It has it all, including action, over-the-top violence, and even a well-told story. But it also has Jessica Alba, Michelle Rodriguez, and Lindsay Lohan as the action chicks, too. Plus, the movie isn't just about Machete, but rather all of the major characters are given the chance to be as important as the main star. (Maybe it was to give Trejo less lines because of his lack of long-time acting experience? Or maybe it was to truly let the star power shine.) \\"Machete\\" is one of the rare movies I can say I wanted to watch again as soon as it was over. Easily a five-star movie that not only lives up to the hype of the Grindhouse trailer, but surpasses it.<br /><br />The only thing that sucked was the lack of Bonus featires on the DVD. Not even deleted scenes or the original Grindhouse trailer! No bonus content, whatsoever. I like many, may have missed \\"Machete\\" when it was in theaters, but trust me, this is a kick-@ss movie worth seeing!
B00001W9G0|5.0|This film begins in the middle, goes back to the past and then moves to the future. Brilliant movie. Both lead actors do a fantastic job. A very poignant ending. Barbara and Robert's characters are from different worlds and show how easy it can be to think that doesn't matter.The sort of movie I could watch more than once.
B001676320|5.0|First, I have to say that even though there are some songs from both groups that I like, but never enough to buy their albums. But concerts are just different, some of my favorite artists, their concerts were just a waste, from poor sound/lighting/video/etc. Now that said, after reading the reviews on this dvd, I decided to see what $18.00 would get me.  I was just so impressed, the two groups together, how they shared songs and just made the stage come alive- I am watching this on my 220\\" panasonic system with Klips reference speakers all around. Even at this size, the picture did not disappoint. From the opening number, you are just absorbed into the energy- and yes- they were having fun as they should. It brought a strong feeling that will keep you coming back to watch over and over again. It reminds me of Hall & Oats live at the troubadour (blue ray), and Sting- Live in Berlin (blue ray).  Picture quality from these two are,,, well, I can count the threads on the microphones screws, the scratches on each guitar, to the veins in their throats. Sound,  I have not capped it out but the mix is fantastic, and if you have the sub, you will be moving furniture!  The other 5 star reviews are just dead on and I appreciate their feedback giving me the initiative to purchase this concert. Welcome to my system Chicago/EWF!
6303393977|5.0|This is an oldie but a goodie. It doesn't hurt that the two male lead actors are Paul Newman and Robert Redford. Allie Macgraw is perfect as the girlfriend. Seeing it for the second time after many years I wasn't as sympathetic to the ending as I used to be. My only critiscm is the choice of music but in it's day it would have been cutting edge. It is hard to discuss the storyline without giving away the ending, but if you are seeing the film for the first time, it is well worth the wait.
0316776963|5.0|Arguably the most famous work in the canon of David Sedaris, Me Talk Pretty One Day has the kind of stories Sedaris fans will love, and Sedaris-virgins will love to discover. Since reading Naked and Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim, I've been amazed by Sedaris's talent for turning mundane life into fascinating explorations of the human experience, and have made it a passive goal of mine to read all his six books. With stories centering around family members or childhood figures (each with the kind of clear, constant voice you can effortlessly hear inside your head as you read), Sedaris must have an incredible memory, detailed diary, or convincing imagination. While those expecting to hear heartthrob stories of excitement and adventure will be disappointed by the National Public Radio-ready prose of Sedaris's books, everyone will be able to appreciate the mastery of his writing and brevity.<br /><br />Some of the stories contained in Me Talk Pretty will be familiar to listeners of NPR's This American Life, which I believe speaks more to their strength than their redundancy. The book contains quite a bit on his experiences in France (touched upon in other works), and has a bit too much Andy Rooney-esque nostalgia at times, but Me Talk Pretty is Sedaris at his best.<br /><br />Continued at: [...]
B002VPE1AW|5.0|The parallels between the storyline in this movie and the destruction of the native American tribes in US history is striking.  Like the Na'vi, most native American tribes had belief systems which described a living energy in all things -- plants, animals -- an energy that is shared between the people, the land, the animals and the plants, the entire ecosystem.<br /><br />The only difference in this movie is that unlike the \\"civil\\"ization of native tribes in the history, marginalized to oblivion, the natives in this movie rise up for the rights of all. This movie reconciles the consciousness of America to our own powerful religion -- that all men are created equal.  A phrase written when one man could own another as property.  It was a phrase we still struggle to live up too and this movie gives a cathartic sense either that the past can be righted or, at the very least, if we had it all to do again, stronger hearts would prevail.  We would chose to act on our powerful principles and give rights to all ideas and all peoples.<br /><br />The real power in this movie is its depiction of universal truths.
0393338827|3.0|In his latest book, The Big Short, ex-investment banker Michael Lewis exposes all that I suspected about the financial industry: that it is essentially a bunch of vastly over-paid, type-A 20/30-year-olds greedily gambling away the public's money on bets they don't understand in ways that are not socially productive, safe in the knowledge that should they fail, they will be furnished with a lavish golden parachute and a government bailout. I find something intrinsically parasitic about people who go into a finance career hoping to make names for themselves betting other peoples' money and collecting salaries exponentially greater than the worth of their labors.<br /><br />The form of the book is a drifting narrative following various real, but unknown players in the financial collapse, illustrating what went wrong and who saw it coming. As the fodder for an eventual movie, it's pretty compelling (see: The Blind Side); and it's a nice and breezy read. As an academic look at the crisis, why it went wrong, and what should be done, Lewis is all platitudes. Missing this key component in a discussion of the financial system leaves an empty story and the reader wanting.<br /><br />Continued at: [...]
B004AHNIGM|4.0|Great release by Gregg Allman. This album grows on you. Allman's voice is still strong and comes through on all these tracks.
0316044695|1.0|First, the good: Lone Survivor offers a rare glimpse at not only the training and operations that SEALs go through, but also a play-by-play look at the thinking of one SEAL during the most dangerous and traumatic operation of his life. We see how advanced SEAL training prepares its members to be effective, resourceful, and tenacious killing machines, even when faced with insurmountable odds and overwhelming force. These men take only the most dangerous missions and accept only the most daring, strong, and pain-tolerant among them. Marcus Luttrell and his ghost writer convey all this in a very approachable style any aspiring SEAL can appreciate, and it will doubtlessly be turned into a movie one day.<br /><br />Now, the bad (and there is a lot of it): First, this book might better be called \\"Glenn Beck goes to War\\". As Luttrell and his men are scoping-out a terrorist stronghold, he would have us believe that while he fears neither Al-Quaeda nor the Taliban nor death itself, the one thing that haunts his dreams and raises the hair on his neck is... the American \\"liberal\\" media. Specifically, he believes that the media would vilify him for killing terrorists and somehow whip-up criminal charges against him. When a bunch of unarmed goat-herders happen upon Luttrell's position (possibly revealing them to the Taliban below), Luttrell quickly suggests (and proudly recounts his suggestion) that kill them (a War Crime). Only for 'fear of what the Liberals might say' does their commander decide instead to let them go (possibly leading to the Taliban discovering the SEALs a short while later). Luttrell immediately regrets the decision, lamenting \\"I felt like such a Liberal.\\"<br /><br />continued at: [...]
B000W7JWUA|5.0|If you haven't tried this game, you have to try it.  You learn careful management of your resources, careful trading and then of course... the unknown luck of the roll of the dice.  I think this game provides hours of fun.        Just don't get overly competitive... from what I've heard, it has caused strains in people's relationships, within families, partners, etc...  but if you like a little competition, this is a fun game.
B000008LJ5|5.0|Firstly I'm a big Thin Lizzy/Phil Lynott fan.  I have owned all the releases, at some point, on Vinyl and have, over a number of years been replacing them with CD issues.  I bought the original CD re-issue's and then the 1996 remastered versions of the 1974-1980 releases (Nightlife - Chinatown).  I was reasonably happy with those remasters but thought they could've been done a bit better, I found them quite bass heavy.  I've only just become aware of the 1993 Metal Blade remasters of Black Rose, Chinatown, Renegade, Thunder & Lightning & Life \\"Live\\".  The only available remasters of Renegade, Thunder & Lightning & Life \\"Live\\" as far as I know are the 1993 Metal Blade issues, which I have recently purchased.  So for Thin Lizzy fans the Metal Blade reissues sounds fantastic compared to the original CD reissue and the 1996 remasters, Phil's voice has been brought to the fore and there is a good seperation and clarity of all the instruments, the bass is improved but not to the point where it takes over.  Now to the songs,the 1st 6 are classic hard rocking Thin Lizzy songs, full of emotion, with a hint of fun on Leave This Town.  Hollywood and Renegade are my favourites.  Then there is a change of style for the last 3 songs, Fats and could be taken from the Johnny The Fox era, Mexican Blood is a hybrid of Thin Lizzy and the sound of Phil Lynott's two solo albums.  The last track is a return to Thin Lizzy style, but the keyboards soften it up.  All in all an excellent Thin Lizzy CD.
0142405787|5.0|I read this book years ago, and this is the only Alex Rider book I can come back to read. Don't get me wrong they are all great for all ages, but Scorpia is a masterpiece. This is the only book of the series (not counting the last one that comes out in a month) that has a special twist and gives the reader a different setting and story. Can't wait for the last one to come out!!
B0041KKYEM|5.0|This was the best movie I've seen in a long time, who knew that the world of dance was so competitive and cut throat, Natalie Portman's portral of Nina was amazing!! The part where her legs became a swan's legs I had to rewatch it again, I was amazed at this movie and I can't wait to see it again!! Twenty five stars!!
B004PP15NC|5.0|We never learn what spell Zatana puts on the champagne or where the Lemur lands, but Justin Hartley is unbelievably hot in the can can outfit.  If anything, his masculinity supercharges the outfit just because he's that cool in his own skin.  Well done.  Glad that Cloe gets to keep her guy this time.  We'll be looking for great things from Alison, Tom, Justin, and the rest of the crew.  Just one or two good saves before you call it quits huh?  This one was pretty cobbled together and lacked a little super power.  Can't believe the super ideas are all gone yet.

0465011047|5.0|This is the second book I have read about North Korea in the past year.  My curiosity about the country grew after hearing a story on NPR (about the book Nothing to Envy).  I found this book to a very short read, mostly because I couldn't put it down.  The story will leave you feeling great empathy for those who suffered, and continue to suffer, in North Korea.  Many times I put the book down, simply unable to believe these things took place at the same time I was growing up in rural America.  I would definitely recommend this book to anyone interested in non-fiction/history/politics.
B0044XV3QY|3.0|I was disappointed in that it did not show the entire extended version, just outtakes of what the extended version that was shown in the theaters showed.  I could have bought a regular version with the special outtakes for a lot less money.
B003Q6D25K|4.0|This was a decent sequel, but no where near as terrifying as the first.  They did a great job linking both together, but everything was strangely back to normal after only three weeks after the terror they endured...but again it's just a movie.  Overall I would recommend this flick to any fans of the first film, but I for one found the first one to be way scarier than this.

B004FD398S|5.0|This is a great 3D movie,  and a must have as some of the other folks have said. This is by far the best 3D movie I have in my collection. If you are reading this review, then you are probably considering buying the 3D version. This is only my opinion, but if you are like myself and as you were sitting in the theater watching this and you thought to yourself \\"I would love to watch this in 3D at home!\\" then this is worth every bit of $150.00 and up. You won't regret it, but you have to be careful when choosing the dealer.   Everything was fine, I ordered it, it took 2-3 days to get to my house. No problems.....until I received it in the mail. I put it in the PS3 and it wasn't 3D!!!!!It was the Blu-Ray that had been put in an Avatar 3D box and then put back into the plastic sleeve. I had just spent about $230.00 all together on this and felt like passing out. I try really hard not to make stupid decisions, but this one wasn't looking very good. I wrote the dealer and explained what had happened and that I was extremely angry and that this was going to have to be taken care of. I was afraid that they would not have the 3D version to send me, and that they would blame me and say that I switched the discs. It was a bit traumatic. They wrote me back a few hours later and said they would take care of it. A few days later I received the 3D version of the film.        So the reason I am writing this review is to let the honest people know what some of the dishonest people are doing. The Dealer explained that they have run into several instances where people buy the Avatar 3D starter kit and carefully remove the 3D version replacing it with the Blu-Ray version. They then either return it claiming it has not been opened, or they sell it, as to not get stuck paying the $150.00-$400. So I just wanted to give you a heads-up. I got lucky with the dealer, because they were honest. I fear that some people won't be so lucky. A few things you can do is try to buy from the dealer who has more ratings, this in no way guarantees you won't be ripped off, but usually the dealers with more ratings have more experience and may be easier to deal with. For this product I would not deal with a start-up dealer, too risky. You can also write the dealer and have them check to make sure the 3D disc is in the case before they ship. Good luck.
0393338827|3.0|I read this book after reading The Greatest Trade Ever - both books follow some of the same charachters, like Dr. Michael Barry and Greg Lippman - but i was shocked that Lewis chose to essentially ignore John Paulson who placed the biggest sub-prime CDS bet and ultimately made by far the MOST money.  Paulson's story in the Greatest Trade Ever is more interesting than any character introduced in this book.
0670022411|4.0|after reading several of the negative reviews on this book i felt i should say something. I agree Diana does spend too much time eating sleeping ect and not having some resolution at the end of book 1 is a let down. Every book in a series should be able to stand alone. But even considering these facts I still think this a great book for her first try. I felt there were very good ideas and that this book brought something new to the table. I didn't see it as a romance book as other's have stated. I am interested to see what she does with book 2. Since i read many of you comparing her to j.k. rolling let me remind you that in the first book in j.k. series she also has a week voice and dragging plot lines as she wrote more books her voice as a writer became clearer, stronger, and finally at the end one of the best authors i have ever read. I think what matters most about this book is that the author has some different ideas and plots to build on, if she finds her voice and edits the second book down to only the most essential plot lines she maybe able to hit a home run out of the park, and i for one hopes she does.
1594484775|3.0|Hello,    I should preface this review by pointing out that I am an avid Hornby fan. I've read High Fidelity at least 300 times, and the other novels at least 100.  I understand and adore his prose, and I comprehend the themes implied and even try to acknowledge his own experiences through his fiction.    Juliet, Naked, however, is not one of his finer novels. Although it is well crafted, and has a solid base, it feels like it drags on for page after page,  without really going anywhere. The premise is 300 pages long. By the time the plot starts to advance in any meaningful way - to develop the characters  constructed in the awfully long premise - we're less than a hundred pages until the end of the book.    The novel feels like a short story, unnecessarily elongated to form a boring and uneven book that could've been just as easily digested in fifty pages.    Again, I take nothing away from Hornby. He [along with Blake Nelson] is my favourite writer. I can open up High Fidelity at any page and engulf myself in  the genius that is Nick Hornby. I can feel the story move in A Long Way Down, and find the details within the characters and their inherent predicaments  in About A Boy. Even Slam makes a case for itself when taken for what it is.    Juliet, Naked was heralded as Hornby's return to original form; another novel about romance and music. I was looking for another High Fidelity and I got  a GOOD, albeit drawn-out, short story turned novel.    Buy the book if you're a Hornby fan. If not, buy High Fidelity.    Thanks for reading.

B003UESJH4|5.0|So many great reviews have already been written summarizing the contents of this film. To avoid redudancy, I will, therefore,  direct my comments as to how incredibly inspiring a movie this was to me personally trusting that there are many others who feel the same way:<br /><br />Colin Furth's performance as the future King George VI was truly phenomenal.I went to see the film with my husband just two weeks after undergoing major surgery. Although weak and still in some pain I could not help but cheer (from the back row of the theater) at the successes the future King (whom Colin so skillfully portrayed) was able to make to come to grips with a frustrating speech impediment. Furth's performance truly deserved his being awarded the Best Actor Academy Award.<br /><br />As a Licensed Clinical Social Worker myself I cannot help but admire so many individuals in the world who without formal clinical training are able to motivate individuals to \\"be the best that they can be.\\" I was later disappointed that Geoffrey Rush who played the legendary speech therapist Lionel Logue did not also win the Best Supporting Actor Academy Award. He truly deserved it. Logue's own story was so inspirational and should be motivating to all those currently who work with servicemembers returning from Iraq and Afghanistan. His ability to help shell shocked Australian soldiers returning from World War I without formal training was something truly to be admired.<br /><br />Also to be most deeply admired is the 73-year-old gentleman who wrote the screenplay (David Seidler).  I especially loved the comment he made at the Academy Awards when he admitted that his mother had once told him that she felt he was \\"going to be a late bloomer.\\"  As a proud Englishman, he respected the wishes of the Queen Mother and waited for some 28 years until she had passed away before he wrote the screenplay for this film. Having had to overcome a speech impediment himself he understood intimately how difficult an achievement that truly was.<br /><br />I will be honored to own a copy of this film ordered from amazon.com and I recommend it to all those who ever had to overcome a disability when the pressure to perform well despite all is so great.as.

B0043KK4N6|5.0|Well, loved the movie went twice and would go again so what's the next best thing to do? Buy the film sound track. Quality recordings, quality classy songs , for me top lyrics and brought back the film images right in to the room where the CD was being played. What more can I say. See the movie and buy the track.

B004HGBUXE|3.0|Lucinda has the uncanny ability to take her gritty voice filled with pain, mix it with reverb on her guitar, and make the hair stand on the arms of a grown man, only to finish him off by breaking him down to tears. This is why I love her music and this is also why I selected her last release as my personal favorite of all new releases that I purchased by any artist in 2008. That Little Honey album had the right mixture of uptempo rockers and tear jerkers like Rarity to have me rank it right up there with Car Wheels. Of course, I also got into her darkest years with World Without Tears and Essence, which were quite chilling. As for West, I never bought it and never even wanted to download anything from it, so I use that as her least enjoyable effort.<br /><br />After waiting more than two years for the follow-up to Little Honey, I pre-ordered the special edition about a month ago. However, when sound clips were finally released two days before the official release, I changed my mind and cancelled the order. The sound clips would have one believe that there are only two uptempo songs and the rest seemed like the demons from her Essence days had come back to haunt her again. After cancelling, I just could not believe what I had done, so I considered downloading the two uptempo songs. Naah! That was equally unfair. So I picked up the cheapest version without the Kitchen Tapes. It turns out that there were five more songs that were keepers for me, and five I can still live without.<br /><br />Okay, so now you are wondering which ones never made the jump to my car's iPod. The third cut Copenhagen should have never been included, in my opinion. A few other reviewers totally missed the boat on this one, perhaps because they never read the nice little lyric book full of nice pictures of people holding up \\"Blessed\\" signs. It is very obvious that Copenhagen is about her own feelings on the day that she found out that a very close person to her had passed away. She happened to be in icy cold Copenhagen in October when this happened. I can relate to this zombie-like feeling because I was in the French West Indies when I had something similar happen to me. Did I write a lyric about it and share it with the whole world? Absolutely not! Yes, Lucinda, this is great stress relief, but keep these very special songs to yourself. I also don't need to be reminded of how I felt in Martinique way back in December of 1992.<br /><br />The next cut that I skipped was Soldier's Song. Now this is a great and powerful lyric that has Grammy written all over it. There is only one major problem. Once you hear the very sad ending on the first listen, listening again becomes an excercise in self-torture. No thanks! Continuing on, Sweet Love drones too much for me, and I really am not a fan of anyone's sappy love songs. The same holds true for Kiss With Your Kiss, which is not a bad song, but just not my cup of tea. As for Convince Me, I just cannot get over the number of times she sings \\"Please\\" and I won't even count how many times from the booklet.<br /><br />Now for the good stuff! The title track Blessed is classic Lucinda and one of the cuts that I initially did not even want to download. There are numerous comparisons of where one can find blessings from the most least likely sources. The song slowly builds up to an extended instrumental crescendo, almost like gospel music. Buttercup is also classic Lucinda and one that I initially liked. This is yet one more song of her dealing with no-good men, with her winning. Seeing Black is quite uptempo, but questions why someone took their own life. Songs like Ugly Truth and the very haunting Awakening would have one believe that the Essence demons are back until one reads the lyrics a bit closer. She has beat the demons and has come out victorious, thank God!<br /><br />With my favorite seven cuts ripped to my car's iPod, the reduced-size album is much more enjoyable, because all of the humdrum cuts are all interspersed on the album. Try this approach and many of you naysayers just may find a lot to like on this album. Car Wheels or Little Honey it is not, but it is also much better than West. But by all means, every Lucinda fan should at least buy this entire album and avoid the sound clips. The title cut alone is worth the price. New fans should start elsewhere.and many of you naysayers just may find a lot to like on this album. Car Wheels or Little Honey it is not, but it is also much better than West.

B000BNI99K|5.0|I love Rod Stewart's Great American Songbook set vol.1-vol.4. The music is great and fun to dance to and puts everyone in a great mood. I highly reccomend it to anyone who enjoys revisiting the old classic love songs and a wonderful, happy, nostalgic,time.
B00117S4GS|5.0|If it didn't have a cult following, you would feel the need to begin one. This show is a riot, sometimes scary, sometimes hysterical, sometimes tragic. Great casting, good stories, fantastic music.
B000FBFN1U|1.0|I read the first two installments of this project with some enthusiasm thinking I would likely enjoy it since it was being made into a TV series and I enjoy some fantasy works.  And I did enjoy them for a while.  But this book goes nowhere and I am sick of the characters.  I want some resolution and I understand there are at least two more books after this one.  It goes on and on ad nauseum.  This whole story could have been done in a couple of good books instead of dragging it out so interminably.  I can't finish this book and I am sure I won't read anymore of Martin's work.  I get the strong feeling his writing is more about the $$$ he can pull in from poor suckers like me, than about producing a good, readable tale.  Enough is enough.  I have better things to do and read.

B0002NRRAG|4.0|This is a very fine album, full of surprises and sprightly innovations for fans of Madeleine Peyroux.  A strong introduction to her work.  For someone new to her work, I found this album had a lot to offer.
B003XU75QG|5.0|This album blew me away. The only complaint we have is that it's too short!! We want more!! For 16 years old, this chick is amazing. The band as a whole just rocks. Its a bit raw but that is part of the charm. Anyone who wants some new rock music check this out. Your ears will be so happy they aren't hearing rehashed pop trash. This is my new favorite band.
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|This is the third and final novel in the trilogy.  It is fantastic!  It neatly ties up everything from the first two books, (except where the heck is the sister???)  Lisbeth Salander is one tough cookie and my new hero!  Enjoy!
B000003R7G|5.0|This album along with Dummy are classics... If you're a portishead fan and are a stickler on sound... pick this up.
B0015DROBO|5.0|I loved this book.  There were a few \\"dry\\" places, but you get through them pretty quickly.  Some of the story is pretty sinister, so I wouldn't recommend this for anyone under 17.  Be prepared for a lot of Swedish names, (they can be pretty difficult to pronounce for a lot of Americans).  Just enjoy the book.  Oh, and read the other two as well, (The Girl Who Played With Fire and The Girl Who Kicked A Hornets Nest).
B0034G4OUO|5.0|Dwayne is way to mean to get in front of!    He be the man!    The man to remove your head...    I would love to talk about it, but it caught me offguard and I want that for you too!
B001NLKT60|5.0|This is the sequel to The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo.  I love this book as much as I loved the first one.  This one is more sinister than the first one and there were some parts that gave me the creeps.  I used to read a lot of Dean Koontz and Stephen King, so that's not easy to do.  This book is not recommended for younger readers.  Or anyone with a heart condition.  Or anyone prone to flashbacks.  Enjoy it and make sure you read the other two, (THe Girl With The Dragon Tattoo and The Girl Who Kicked A Hornets Nest)!
B002ZG9774|4.0|I dont like musicals at all, but I do like Cher!! This movie thankfully wasnt singing throughout the whole movie, however they sang when necessary!! I have to say this movie has a great soundtrack, lots of lights, glitz and glam!
B00163XX0O|5.0|This novel is great in that it portrays a classic anti-hero within a futuristic, bizarre world. The society that Burgess creates is both intriguing and sadly believable, and there are many questions that the reader is left asking about agency, violence, and humanity in general. Alex, the main character, goes through a maturing process, which makes this a good example of a coming-of-age novel. For that reason, I would recommend this book to both teenagers and adults that are interested in the sci-fi genre and want to have a brain-twisting, creepy experience. However, Alex speaks in a language called Nadsat, which is a mix of English and Slavic-based slang. It can be difficult to understand, especially at first, so I would not recommend it to people who are not willing to put a little effort into the novel to get something out of it. It is also extremely violent, so the faint of heart might want to find another book with butterflies, rainbows, and the like.
B00009NHC5|5.0|If you want to see a great suspense thriller, Wait Until Dark (1967) is it. This classic stars Audrey Hepburn, Alan Arkin, Richard Crenna, Samantha Jones, Jack Weston, Efrem Zimbalist, Jr., and Julie Herrod. Basically, the movie is about heroin that is smuggled inside a doll at a Montreal airport. When a con woman, Lisa (Samantha Jones), notices a man spying on her, she gives the doll to a total stranger named Sam Hendrix (Efrem Zimbalist). Hendrix is a photographer who has a blind wife named Susy (Audrey Hepburn). The heroin-filled doll ends up at this couple's residence in New York City. Some con men try to take advantage of the fact that Susy is blind and do everything they can think of to get the doll from her. Do they get the doll?<br /><br />The music by Henry Mancini is perfect for this '60s suspense thriller about drugs. The instruments seem to be a little out of tune and the music off key. It fits the atmosphere perfectly.<br /><br />I thought Audrey Hepburn played her role brilliantly. She was nominated for an Academy Award for her performance. She was a great actress. She was pretty and cute all in one, an unbeatable combination.<br /><br />This DVD is in widescreen format. The extras include a short 8-minute feature called Take A Look In The Dark, where Alan Arkin and producer Mel Ferrer (Audrey Hepburn's real life husband at the time) talk about how the movie was made. A feature called Stage Frantics describes the transformation from a stage play to a movie. You can read the \\"Warning\\" word-for-word that movie theaters posted about what was going to happen in the closing minutes of the movie. It's quite interesting and a sign of the time period this movie was made in.<br /><br />I highly recommend this movie to fans of suspense thrillers and fans of Audrey Hepburn.
B00021R7CG|5.0|By Dawn's Early Light is a great movie about nuclear war, morality and the human condition. James Earl Jones, as always, is one of the more dynamic characters in the movie.  The movie is about the struggle between doing what is strong, and what is correct.  It was made for TV so is only available in standard def.  Cinematography isn't amazing but it isn't bad.  For the price it's worth watching at least once.

0756404738|5.0|I picked up a copy of The Name of the Wind at a bookstore while randomly skimming the shelves for something new. I hadn't suspected that I'd end up staying up all night long for the pure and simple fact that I couldn't put it down. I waited for years to finally get my hands on a copy of The Wise Man's Fear, which would normally mean that with all the hype and anticipation, I was bound to be disappointed...    I wasn't.    What can I say? I laughed, I cried. I neglected sleep, work, and friends once again just to see what happened next. I must admit that the story does have a small sense of middle-of-the-story drag, but that didn't keep me from loving every chapter. And honestly, as the second book in a three part series, that's to be expected. Tensions grow, conflicts appear and are resolved, we learn a little more of the legend of Kvothe, but the big questions are not yet answered...    It's going to be a long, long wait for book three...
0385341679|3.0|I just didn't love this book.  I felt like the series started losing steam after the 3rd book (the 4th book just didn't seem to move the story along much)-and the 5th book was probably 150 pages too long--yes I get it, earth is still in chaos, the sinsar dubh is still creating havoc and there are monsters, move on already.  I started not liking most of the characters; there aren't any real \\"heroes\\" among them, they are all \\"the end justifies the means\\" kind of characters (with maybe the exception of Christian) with no particular honor.  I compare my feeling about the 5th book to my feeling after watching the last episode of the tv show Lost- a \\"That's it?  What about the rest of the things that didn't get answered?\\" kind of feeling.  I guess after waiting well over a year since book 4 I expected a neater/tidier/more complete/more succinct wrap up.
B00356CO1E|5.0|I am a mother of 4 young children and was in the worst shape of my life. I don't think I could even locate an ab muscle after 4 kids.<br /><br />I am maybe 20 days into using this workout, and just bought Episode 2 today to mix things up. After Day One I could hardly make it up or down our apartment stairs. But I kept on and by day 4 or 5 it really does get better and you already feel stronger. I took a friend's advice and allowed myself to eat as much (healthy) food as I wanted in the first 2 or 3 weeks, just to build muscle and support myself. Now I am reasonably restricting while using the workout daily. I have to voice my opinion- contrary to other reviews- that you should not sell yourself short and only do this every other day. There is nothing unreasonable about this level or workout/ impact/ cardio for 20 minutes each day. You can do it!<br /><br />I love how quick it is to complete, I love to break a heavy sweat every day, and most of all I love how I feel muscles building all over my body! I didn't take beginning measurements but things already fit differently and more importantly, I feel great. Just try it- my first week I used canned goods as weights until I bought some- just jump in!<br /><br />I look forward to having some variety with the other levels. The only annoying thing about this workout is Julian saying the same things at you when you're working your butt off day after day.
0307266303|5.0|I love the book so far. After having foot surgery in the last three years, this might be good information for my recovery.
B0033TJATW|5.0|Of course as soon as I recieved this DVD I watched it. I happened to be babysitting my Five-year old Nephew at the time and he loved it just as much as I did. He loved \\"Badder\\" the idea of a kid dancing like Michael Excited him. He wants to learn to dance like that now. He also loved the fact that Michael turned into a car and then a spaceship during the \\"smooth criminal\\" sequence. I think watching it with him was way better than watching it by myself. I got to litteraly sit there and watch someone become a Michael Jackson fan.He would even get upset if you couldn't see Michael for a second. The best part was when Michael was playing with the kids in the meadow, My nephew looked over at me and said, I bet they have fun playing with him, I think he makes kids happy. I was like, YES! he gets it. Like Michael believed innocenct can see the truth. After it was all over he told me that Michael Jackson was awesome. I loved hearing that. So if you have a little one in your life that you would like to spend quality time with and possible make a Michael Jackson fan, BUY THIS DVD and watch it with them. If they are anything like my nephew hey will love it and say some really sweet things that you will definatley want to remember.  Also just watching it will be a great experience for anyone. You get a nice little glimpse at what was going on in Michael's head. It has a great message about good over coming evil. Its fun to watch and if you like to see Michael smile and laugh you will love it. It is definatley a must have for any Michael Jackson fan!
B0019OP0GU|1.0|Nothing against Amazon.com, but I did not like this movie as there is one scene where all three of the girls are in the circle and making a promise about getting their names in the history books, and one girl ends the promise with \\"Amen\\".  The other two girls look at her suprised that she said \\"Amen\\" because they have never said \\"Amen\\" before and she responds that they need help and she does not care where it comes from.  This was VERY disappointing to me.  It seems that people only call on God when they need help and then walk away once they have received what they needed.  So, I was no longer interested in watching the movie.
B000FIMG68|5.0|We enjoyed the season but founds some flaws in the disc which were disappointing since they were suppoded to be brand new.  Just ordered the third season and looking forward to finding out what happens next
B003PIUBZS|5.0|I aggree  there is overuse of the cgi blood (very unrealistic) and the often misplaced sex scenes.  I loved the way it was used in the movie \\"300\\", and in some of the episodes, such as the pilot episode, but its seems to quickly be used as a time filler.  When the acting and story line are the main feature, its great, as are the plot turns and fight scenes.  The actors are very good especially Andy Whitfield (hope he has a speedy recovery).  Even though at times it's like a comic book or graphic novel come to life, most will enjoy this very good gladiator series. R.I.P ANDY WHITFIELD
B00475AYJQ|5.0|In the interest of my sanity - this will be a fairly brief review. I got this book yesterday, on March 1st - and just finished it a few minutes into March 3rd. No spoilers contained, it should be fair to say.     I could rate this book as either one of the best pieces I have ever read, or one of the most frustrating. I obviously went with the former, because it was only frustrating in all the right ways. Sometimes it seems that you have something in this story completely figured out, but then it's either not mentioned again or a resolution was brought about that annoys you with how wrong you were to think it could be otherwise. The most damning piece that could be said against The Wise Man's Fear is that you know that so much is put on hold because there is another book of equal or greater length yet to come.      That previous paragraph was necessarily vague, and I'm sure everyone will have their own points where they felt the way I did.      To provide this with the semblance of a helpful review; The Wise Man's Fear is, if you read book one until your eyes hurt - exactly what you want. You will have to force yourself to stop reading, and you will treat this book as if it were as rare a treasure as could be found in the University's archives.
B00111YM5G|2.0|Beautiful to watch.  I agree that it's  similar the movies \\"the Crow\\" and  \\"Prophecy\\" and very dark and moody, but it suffers from a horrible story line, bad editing and directing.  Shame, it could have been good in the right hands.

B000FQIRXQ|5.0|\\"David Copperfield\\" is something of a modern fairy-tale. The titular character, like so many other heroes, is a boy born into tragedy. His father dies before he his even born, and while he lives a relatively happy life for the first eight years or so with his mother and Peggotty, the kindly servant of the Copperfield family, his fragile existence is shattered when his mother remarries a horrible, controlling man named Edward Murdstone, who becomes the quintessential \\"evil stepfather\\". He and his sister take over the household, taking advantage of Mrs. Copperfield and abusing David mercilessly with corporal punishment. David endures horrific tenures at a boarding school, beatings by his step-father, and the pain of losing his mother to illness before he is sent away to paste labels on jars of bootblack at a factory....and that's just part 1!    Part 2 is nonetheless fraught with troubles, and follows him as he makes his way through adulthood and confronts the tragedies and joys that come with it. The character of David Copperfield has always been one of my favorites from any of Dicken's books. He does not make his own story, but has his story shaped by the actions of those around him. His steadfast resoluteness in the face of adversity is admirable, if not inspiring, and his diligence and aspiration for something more in life, no matter how low he has sunk, ultimately leads him to his own \\"happily ever after\\"; not like Pip in \\"Great Expectations\\", who largely comes to nothing because of his own shortcomings.    The story is typically Dickensian, with dirty London streets, heart-tugging tragedy, and plenty of cruel adults who wreak their vengeance upon innocent children. There are light moments, of course, and as far as plot goes, this one isn't nearly as dark and bleak as \\"Great Expectations\\" or \\"Oliver Twist\\". For one thing, it actually has a good ending for just about everyone, a rarity in most of Dicken's other works.     The BBC evidentially put a ton of time andmoney into this production. Everything looks so authentic, from the sets down to the costumes. Much of it was filmed on location, and even what wasn't still appears in perfect continuity to the time period. The score, composed by Robert Lane and interspersed with several classical pieces, is simply beautiful, and avoids sounding either cheap or overproduced for a film of this scale.    If you've been turned off by previous Masterpiece productions because of their lack of proper casting, than you'll be pleasantly surprised by this one. Everyone is perfect for their parts, and give solid, believable performances. Many will criticize for the abundance of British film royalty, but the way I see it, the reason those people are so famous in the first place is because they're so talented, and when you're trying to adapt a Charles Dickens novel, you need good actors to do the job. Some of the standouts include Maggie Smith as Aunt Betsey Trotwood, Bob Hoskins and Imelda Staunton as the irrepressible Mr. and Mrs. Micawber, Pauline Quirke as Peggotty, and Amanda Ryan as Agnes. Nicholas Lynhurst gives a suitably slimy performance as Uriah Heep, and becomes a villain you want to hate. Ian McKellan is equally as despisable as the vicious headmaster, Mr. Creakle.     As for David Copperfield himself, Daniel Radcliffe gives an astoundingly good performance in the first part of this film as young David. He was only ten at the time, but is as good or better than most of the adults, and plays his part with an incredible amount of pathos and emotion. The looks in his eyes are truly those of an old soul in a child's body. How anyone could even pretend to be cruel to him is beyond me. Because of him, Part 1 is made even more compelling. That may account for the slight let-down feel of Part 2. Oh well. If only they had been able to find an actor as talented as him to play David as an adult, then this production would have been absolutely perfect.    All in all, this is the best PBS Masterpiece production I have ever seen, and certainly one of the best Dickens adaptations. If you like good, well-produced British drama, don't fail to see \\"David Copperfield\\". You won't be sorry!
0061706620|4.0|Very happy!  I'm new to the show and can't watch them fast enough!  Now I can go flipping through that all important journal along with the characters on the show.  It's like a sing-along book, but with screaming and guns!
1594202842|1.0|Provocative, but an essentially useless 'manifesto'!  Here's my take on  Chua's 'tigerism' :  I will BET MONEY that if she had a son, her Jewish husband would have stepped in EARLY on and yanked her chain so hard her HEAD WOULD HAVE SPUN all the way back to Hunan Province. Additionally, she's a phony.      We' have all been around people like Chua.  They personify the jabbering stage mother, here as a Chinese-American Gypsy Rose Lee who lives vicariously through her children while insisting that this book is about her 'journey as a mom'.  While I understand, and SHARE the notion having  'high expectations' of children, her preposterous narrative in this missive WILL come back to haunt her  at some point in the lives of her daughters.  While they're still quite young - the jury is still out.  And since she has made them both fodder for the reading public to 'evaluate' over time, there can be no conclusion drawn here other than that Chua likes attention.    Her narrative is disingenuous in the extreme, and I suspect that she's ill prepared to answer for what she has done.  In the few interviews I've seen, she seems to be backpedaling when her despicable commentary towards her children is met with incredulity, followed by frank revulsion.  Her persona of ultra acceleration is more than just energy.  Her persistent and endless nervous energy makes her seem  as though she's fueled by stimulants. This makes her unwatchable in the extreme.  Ms. Chua seems unaware that  ALL immigrant parents suffered when they landed here.  Those who saw and comprehended that education was the only way out excelled.   We get that. Since Chua wants to take her place amid accomplished Chinese, she really must take a breath and then  take a page from the fame of another Asian parent, Ming Tsai.  Ming NEVER has to write a book to expound upon his parenting techniques, quite Asian indeed.  It's EVIDENT when his parents appear on his show that the respect and love he has for them is palpable.  And his realization that life is about SO much more than Food, academics, violin lessons, piano lessons, ad infinitum, ---go ahead and fill in the blank.  Sorry Ms. Chua,   Your book is unconvincing.'  It's all about YOU, YOU and YOU.  You have sacrificed your daughters in order to try and recreate some manner of life which no longer exists.  Of this, you'll be certain during the next decade or two.  While you've been living in the past (your past), the world has changed.  Respect and regard for your ancestors is still viable, but NOT by command performances by  little hearts so easily BROKEN.  The simplest lesson here is that our children want to please us and they'll DO ANYTHING to do that.  You have missed the point, sadly.
B004J713JW|4.0|I am sure that this will be a great concert to watch on DVD (Blu-ray no less), but I just want to know why this package does not include the CDs of the show as well? It appears that you have to purchase the standard DVD in order to get the CDs. Not good in my book.

0316098337|5.0|I'm going to miss little Jack now that I've finished reading his story. The book was a sad wonderful story of a bond between mother and child in desperate times. You'll be pulled into the \\"room\\" and feel like a prisoner right along with Jack. I think the author wrote very well and chose the best way to present the story. At times I thought I knew what was happening next, but was surprised every time. Once you read this, it'll make you think hard about how you feel about your own home and your kids.
B0041KKYDI|5.0|Didn't want to watch this, I was dragged into it by my wife. What a surprise. Having read the actual story when it happened, I couldn't imagine the movie being too interesting. Guy's arm gets stuck  under a rock and he saws his arm off to get away. I never imagined that film could convey so many emotions. When he decides after a couple of days to amputate his arm but his knife is too dull, then it really gets interesting. Great acting and cinematography. A+++ all the way around.

You've got nothing to lose.  There are a lot of principles in this book I've applied over the years with great results.  Anyone who reads this book will be able to take a few things away that will improve their life in some way.
031603438X|1.0|Disappointed, disappointed....As one person wrote surprisingly \\"The fact that he remembers is amazing\\" He probably remembers it as well as he remembers Brian. Thought after all this time he could just speak the truth and shame the devil. Not so....such a shame.  My biggest question after reading this is, after all these years does he still have to lie so much about Brian?? Guilty conscious?  There are those of us that still remember Brian....And with all the Brian lies, how can anything else be thought of as being true? Why write a autobiography and lie?? Would have reviewwed this -5 stars but it was unavailable.
B0001GMIOE|1.0|I recently purchased a backup BP-511A battery \\"by Canon\\" from Amazon.com.     I noticed it looked different than the one that came with my 40D when I ordered it, but it said \\"by Canon\\" so I ordered it anyway.    The BP-511A pictured on Amazon is black with white lettering painted on it.  Is this even a Canon product?    The one that came with my 40D is dark grey and has Canon lettering etched into the top of the battery.    When I received the battery I immediately thought something was wrong.  It was a black battery with NO writing on the top, \\"sealed\\" in a flimsy \\"Canon\\" package.       Upon further inspection I noticed the package could be slid open easily.    I looked at the underside of the battery and there were Canon stickers, but no number etched in the box like my original.    The battery cover had the battery charge indicator, so I think that was the only real part included.    I don't think Amazon should sell or allow the sale of batteries that are questionable like these.  I'm pretty sure they are not \\"by Canon\\".  Another user even posted pictures below the battery showing how to tell fakes.    Come on Amazon, fix this mess.

A sign of a good book, no? The flashback retelling was quite original too. The 2nd book could make this one better or kill the series, here's hoping for the former.
0439023491|5.0|I picked up this book, and it the other two in the series after over hearing a couple talking about it over coffee.  I devoured all three in the span of a three day weekend.<br /><br />So to say I enjoyed it is a bit shy of an understatement.  Well written, with engaging characters that continue to grow and change throughout the series. (something that other YA fiction seems to shy from to a degree)<br /><br />Parents be warned, there is a lot of violence and death in all three of these novels.  Not simply side characters, but at times, characters that are well placed throughout the books.  Readers on the bottom side of the YA age brackets might find some occurrences in these books a bit overwhelming.  This trilogy is best read with an adult, and hopefully questions about mankind, humankind, war and what we do to one another in the name of control and power should arise.

0439023513|5.0|I picked up this book, and it the other two in the series after over hearing a couple talking about it over coffee.  I devoured all three in the span of a three day weekend.      So to say I enjoyed it is a bit shy of an understatement.  Well written, with engaging characters that continue to grow and change throughout the series. (something that other YA fiction seems to shy from to a degree)      Parents be warned, there is a lot of violence and death in all three of these novels.  Not simply side characters, but at times, characters that are well placed throughout the books.  Readers on the bottom side of the YA age brackets might find some occurrences in these books a bit overwhelming.  This trilogy is best read with an adult, and hopefully questions about mankind, humankind, war and what we do to one another in the name of control and power should arise.
B000K5ZHMG|5.0|Excellent, well done, first rate film. McDowell was at his peak in this film. He played the part of the sick and warped caligula, to a tee. The scenes were fantastic, and up to par in the attempt to create Rome the way it really was. I know boring movies that are dragged out to the point of driving one coo-coo. This film kept me interested to the end. I saw it in the theater when it first came out, and couldn't wait for it to come out on vhs or cd. Helen Mirren was gorgeous and sensuous in all her beauty and skills. Yes, this one I will watch again and again, and advise all to purchase a copy.

0061726826|5.0|It is hard not to compare Delirum to Westerfeld's Uglies series.  Not that that is a bad thing, both are very good and if you have not had a chance to check out Westerfeld, I highly recommend it.<br /><br />\\"It has been sixty-four years since the president and the Consortium identified love as a disease, and forty-three since the scientists perfected a cure\\"<br /><br />First, you have to admit that is quite a catchy way to start a book, especially a book aimed at young teen readers.<br /><br />Lena Holliday is nearly 18, the year in which she is to undergo the treatment that will prevent Amor Deliria Nervosa, an insidious disease that affects your mind so that you cannot think clearly, or make rational decisions about your own well-being.  In only 95 days, she will no longer have to fear that this disorder will affect her and she will be able to lead a perfectly normal life without the dangers of love and not have to face the madness that those from the old days had to endure.<br /><br />Set within the borders of Portland, Maine, an area sealed to prevent the spread of this disease, Lena lives a controlled life, a life watched over by the Regulators who are always on the lookout for symptoms of this disease.  She looks forward to not having to live in fear that her mind and body will one day turn against her.<br /><br />Not wanting to live the quiet desperation that her mother faced, when three unsuccessful procedures left her uncured, Lena looks forward to the security of this life changing procedure.  That is until she un-expectantly meets a boy that will forever change her belief, a boy that will show her a world that she has never known, a forbidden place that offers beauty and wonder.<br /><br />Lauren Oliver grabs you quickly from the beginning and slowly weaves you to a climatic ending that has you wanting to grab her by the collar and shake her until she tells you want happened.  I have not been this impressed by an ending in quite a long time and I commend Ms Oliver for piquing my curiosity.

B004L3AR0K|5.0|LOVE AND OTHER DRUGS is based on Jamie Reidy's highly regarded novel 'Hard Sell: The Evolution of a Viagra Salesmen' and as adapted for the screen by Charles Randolph, Marshall Herskowitz and Edward Zwick (who also directs). It is a little jewel of a film.  If the portion of the film that deals far too long with a silly Radio City Music Hall show of Pfizer Pharmaceuticals training program bores the audience (it should have been severely edited for many reasons), it is worth the wait for the actual romance story that follows.<br /><br />Jamie Randall (Jake Gyllenhaal) can't hold a job, preferring to focus on womanizing, much to the disdain of his wealthy obese brother Josh (Josh Gad), and his parents (George Segal and Jill Clayburgh in a role that was to be her last). Jamie best friend Bruce (Oliver Platt) joins Jamie in becoming a pharmaceutical rep for Pfizer and the two are placed on the road to push Zoloft and Zithromax, finding that the market is hoarded by Trey Hannigan (Gabriel Macht), an Eli Lily  salesman selling Prozac.  Jamie encounters Trey in the office of Dr. Knight (Hank Azaria), studies Trey's success and his own failure, and in the process encounters a patient of Dr. Knight, the free spirited gorgeous Maggie Murdock (Anne Hathaway) who has been with both Trey and Dr. Knight.  Jamie's lack of success pushing Zoloft suddenly reverses when Pfizer comes out with Viagra: Jamie is a natural to be the leading salesman for this new enhancing drug - or is he? There is a strange chemistry that develops between Jamie and Maggie and despite their unlikely qualifications as relationship candidates, each finds in the other the qualities that turn wild one nighters into a solid love affair.  Maggie has Parkinsonism and that aspect alters the way each approach the relationship.  But it is the magic of how this blossoms into one the screen's best romances that is the gift of the film.<br /><br />The story is frequently disrupted with sidebars that are supposed to provide comic relief but in the end simply take up too much space away from Jamie and Maggie.  Had the film been edited to clean its shelves the way Jamie cleaned the physicians' sample shelves of Prozac the total product would have been even better.  What the film brings into focus is the enormously maturing talents of Gyllenhaal and Hathaway: they may just be the next great Hollywood silver screen couple.  This is 'a fine (and sensitive) romance' and well worth watching.  Grady Harp, March 11f but in the end simply take up too much space away from Jamie and Maggie.

006112429X|5.0|I had to read this book for my A level English literature course and at first I was apprehensive as the first few pages weren't inspiring. And I'd say the first third of the book is pretty week, but I struggled through that first section and I am truly glad I did. The second two thirds were a true piece of literary genius. I love it and everyone else I know who has read it feels the same. The second half is very thought provoking and I found myself thinking about the book and it's interpretations long after I finished reading a chapter or two. Whether I'll ever reread I'm not sure as I think the impact this has the first time you read can't be repeated but I really would recommend as the second half is so moving and inspirational. I actually chose to write my coursework on, along with most of class, because we felt there was so much to say about it - This is one book you need to read yourself as to just describe it like some of these reviews doesn't do it justice.     I'd say just persevere as the first half is rather self indulgent but it does pave the way for the second half as you aren't expecting how drastically the book changes!!
B002ZG993Q|4.0|I recall reading or hearing somewhere that \\"The American\\" isn't quite what you expect.  I never gave that much thought until I watch the movie.  The promos for this movie depict it as an action and/or suspense film.  This is somewhat misleading and why trailers/previews at times can either praise a film or condemn them before they are released.  I can say that I really, really enjoyed this motion picture.<br /><br />I am not going to rehash plot detail, because many other reviewers have done a nice job of providing a summary of this flick.  In contrast, I will betray my former statement by saying George Clooney plays a Jack, a hit man who finds pseudo sanctuary in Castel del Monte after a situation of his turns sour in Sweden.  Jack escapes Sweden and after speaking to an old contact ends up in Castel del Monte.  There is more to the movie, such as the Swedish hunting Jack, the duplicity Jack has towards his lifestyle, theology, romance, deception and redemption.<br /><br />This movie isn't fast paced and is not action packed.  It is very minimal in nature and in many ways mimics an art house film.  I found this refreshing because it wasn't a CGI fest and an unintelligent piece of cinema.  There are lush shots of the landscape, images are framed almost like \\"still life\\" and there are periods of time where there is little dialogue.  I wasn't very surprised by these elements since this movie was directed by Anton Corbijn.<br /><br />Anton Corbijn has spent most of his career taking photographs and directing music videos.  The former and the latter bless the creative process of this movie.  This would explain the artist cinematography, framing and little dialogue.  There are two scenes in particular that imitate videos that Corbijn has directed one with U2 and one with Depeche Mode.  Corbijn is the creative director for both of these bands and has been so for twenty-five plus years.<br /><br />As for the acting, I felt George Clooney provided a solid performance as an ambivalent hit man questioning his \\"purpose\\".  Clooney provides most of his acting without and/or little dialogue, which I felt was captivating.  Violante Placido was very good as Clara, the prostitute that Jack becomes involved with.  I must note that Violante Placido is a gorgeous woman and drips with sexuality.<br /><br />This movie might not be for all tastes (and that is okay), it is slow paced, at times moody and has some film noir element to it.  Notwithstanding, \\"The American\\" proves, if nothing else, a movie can still use the basic elements of the human psyche (theology, revenge, hope, sex and redemption) and display them in a moving and intelligent manner.his \\"purpose\\".

B00005JOA0|4.0|I have come to enjoy the work of Toby Stephens since his performance in the Masterpiece Theatre version of \\"Jane Eyre\\". This was another interesting tale from the Bronte' era.
B003UYUQZW|2.0|So many things I wanted to like. It looked like a wonderful adventure movie. But it was so boring. Hardly any adventure. All the actors can do better. AUGH! However, quite a beautiful movie. But, if you like these arabic/persian movies, stick to classics like Thief of Bagdad or Disney's Aladdin or 7th Voyage of Sinbad. Sorry to mention those great movies in this review but you need an alternative!!

Confined to a wheelchair due to his injuries the war veteran can no longer take sexual care of his good looking wife. Enter the male, cocky, jerky, gamekeeper. He wants to pound her and guess what? The sex sceens are decent in lenght and there are a few good lust sceens  I enjoy the plot in this film and I'm currently looking for other titles of the same nature (cheating wife).
B004ETVAH0|5.0|I can only give 5 stars but this is such a superlative set of music.  You cannot leave this page without buying it!  At the moment, the price ($10) makes an amazing bargain.      This is the Jeff Beck album I always wanted.  20 songs, live, and he just blasts his way though every one like a Ferrari on a test course. If we could somehow climb into a time machine and take this music go back 40 years, several of these takes would have become canonical.  E.g. Walking in the Sand. But there is not a bad cut here. I especially love the fact that all the cuts are old-school short and you don't have that post-vinyl-era bloat where 3 minute songs become 5 minute songs.     Buy it!
1439107955|5.0|An excellent book.  The author has that rare gift of being able to explain a very complex topic in a way that is clear and without having to resort to layman's terms.  His passion about science and medicine is infectious, much of the time you forget you are reading about a dreaded disease.  Perhaps you won't come away from this book any less fearful of cancer but you will better understand not just the biology of it but the great effort and vast sacrifice that is required to tackle any life threatening illness.
1594202842|5.0|I loved this book.  I didn't always agree with how she raised her children, but admired her courage and honesty in writing such a powerful book.
B004I2K4E8|3.0|My primary critique is of the DVD itself and not so much the content.    All I received is a bare-bone Blu-ray DVD. No history, playlist or background information like found in the 10th Anniversary.     The 25th may be fine for those familiar with the story line, have read the book or seen the performance on stage; but, IMO, not for a first time viewer of Les Misérables.    We have seen the play on stage in London and a USA touring production. I prefer the cast of the 10th Anniversary performance.
B002NOAF9W|3.0|OK, to be fair, I have to say that I haven't yet bought the remastered version.  But I definitely will.  I was at this concert (I think it was Thanksgiving week at Madison Square Garden), and even if there is just a LITLE remastering, I want to hear it.  Besides, the DSD (aka Super-Audio CD or SACD) versions of their studio albums sound amazing, with all the errors in speed during pressing finally ironed out.    But for those of you that have this new version, only you can answer this 1 important question:   Is Janis Joplin on it?    See, during the show I was getting thirsty during Ike and Tina's set.  I was pressed up close to the stage, close enough that I could see through Keith's lucite guitar.  So I made my way all the way to the back to get a soda.  Walking back towards the stage, I noticed something strange - the crowd was surging forward, which they hadn't done at all during the other Ike & Tina songs.  Then I realized the stage was drenched in strobe light, and Tina was singing Land of a Thousand Dances, and there was some strange creature next to her swinging her long hair wildly and - Holy Crap! Its Janis Joplin!    Now before you ask, I wasn't stoned (still too young), and yes I was sure, because that was the last song in the set, and when the house lights came up, Janis was roaming around the bleachers on the side of the stage.  She very kindly obliged my request for an autograph.    But the strangest part of all is this: NOT A SINGLE REVIEW of this box set mentions if this was the recording that is at the end of Disc 3.    So please, if you have this, put your headphones on (cans, not earbuds,please) queue up that track, and see if you can hear Janis' unmistakable wail alongside Tina's huskier, deeper voice.  Then please, let us all know!!    P.S. On the original recording, it was Janis who shouted the reply to Mick saying  \\"You don't want my trousers to fall down, do you?\\"
B004HGBUVG|5.0|So \\"Blessed,\\" one of the best albums she's ever released, every note she sings pure class!     she doesn't get older, just better.
B001CTUI8M|5.0|Great concert.<br />Within Temptation doesn't disappoint.<br />Been waiting to see this for a long time.<br /><br />Blu-ray visual quality was excellent, audio had a few drop out spots but not enough to take away from the overall experience.<br />Loved it.
B0002O37RM|5.0|I first heard this CD in Seattle while visiting some friends.  This music was perfect for adding to the ambience -- was more than \\"just background\\" but less than dominating.  Just good, interesting but non-instrusive jazz -- great music for socializing with a small group of friends.
B001G0MFOM|1.0|Just recently purchased season 5 and 6.  WTF happened?  Seriously...where did the good show go?  After season 4 this series just turned to total crap.  Sorry to put it that way, but in my opinion the writers blew it.  Season 5's pacing was all off, characters were disjointed and seemed lost.  Plus what is with this single white female thing?  Come on...you actually pulled a Jenny Schecter on your own show and couldn't come up with anything original?<br /><br />Than we get to season 6 and it didn't get better, it got worse.  You had only 8 episodes to fix the mess that was season 5 and instead of giving us a decent original ending you went for the old \\"Who Shot J.R.\\" paradigm?  Seriously?  Plus, as many others have all ready said, you had the characters all over the place doing uncharacteristic things which took this show to a whole new low.<br /><br />Sorry to say this as well, but, the last two seasons was a total disgrace and dishonor to the GLBT community.  You managed to make it seem like we're all crazy, driven by sex, untrustworthy, and incapable of making commitments.  Just horrible writing, and unoriginal drivel, and the finale...total garbage.  My cat can puke up hairballs with more originality than the stuff you gave us.<br /><br />I sat and watched the season 5 and season 6 episodes with my girlfriend and was telling her what would happen long before they would happen.  Why was I able to do this?  Because it was that unoriginal, we'd seen these stories before in other shows!<br /><br />After season 4 I think the writers and producer were only in it for the money and could careless what they did with the show, the characters, and the story.  If anyone else is planning on getting this series I would highly recommend only getting the first 4 season and do not even bother watching season 5 or 6.  Season 5 and 6 and just pure garbage and a money grab.
0060090367|5.0|This is the 3rd book by Marian Keyes that I read. I am totally amazed by her stories, and it was not different with \\"Watermelon\\". Well, since it's Keyes' first book, it is not as deep and complex as the ones that came next. That being said, if you want a light-hearted, sweet, smart and funny story to read... go for it! I felt so excited about Claire's life... I was so into it! It was hard to read the last page. I totally recommend it!
0142404128|4.0|There's a lot going on in Charlie and the Great Glass Elevator, Dahl's lesser-known followup to Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. After all, this is a book involving a space hotel, a carnivorous alien threat that's very proud of its spelling abilities, a President dominated by his nanny (who's also his vice-president), a pill that makes people younger (to the point where they go into negative ages), and any number of other oddities and goofy asides. The plot of the book is loose, to put it mildly, but the looseness allows Dahl to pack the book with silliness and absurdities, including a budgetary officer who's working hard to balance the budget on his head and a most cunning fly trap. Does it all really cohere? No, not really. And there's a somewhat nastier and grouchier tone among the adults throughout the book, as opposed to the anarchic but sweet story of Chocolate Factory. That all being said, the book was still a huge hit with my four-year-old, who absolutely loved the silly tone of it all and reveled in how goofy it all was. As for adults, it doesn't hurt that Dahl has nicely sarcastic tone towards people in power that works on adults without ever being risque or smarmy. Is it as good as Chocolate Factory? Not at all. But it's still a fun little dose of whimsy and fun, and worth checking out if you enjoyed the original. (A note, though: some points of the book, most especially the conversation with the Chinese leaders, haven't aged so well, especially in these more culturally aware times. But they're easily skipped without missing much.)
B00127RAJY|5.0|Other reviewers weren't kidding when they said this was a tough workout video...I am a relatively fit person (among those that are looking to lose weight), and I was literally gasping by the end of this workout. Jillian does not let you rest! She keeps you going the entire time. It's just 20 minutes, but you really do work every second. The 3-2-1 (3 minute strength, 2 minute cardio, 1 minute abs) combo really exhausts you.<br /><br />I have found this to be very effective in losing weight. I joined Weight Watchers about 1.5 months before getting this DVD, and doing these workouts is what helped me see the largest weight loss since joining the program. It's only 20 minutes but it is more of a workout than my previous elliptical routine! It's like Jillian says on the tape - \\"This will take the place of hours of phoning it in at the gym.\\"<br /><br />I was afraid Jillian would annoy me because I've never watched The Biggest Loser and I know she has a rep for being tough. But I actually found her really motivating! She is really there with you. At one point, she even says \\"I know you're really tired right now and you want to shut off this DVD.\\" It's really motivating! You want to try harder because of what she says.<br /><br />I highly recommend this tape. Workout 1 is definitely challenging enough. Workout 2 is also tough. I have  yet to attempt Workout 3, but I can only imagine how exhausting it will be! And how much fat it will blast. :-)
0156347113|4.0|Loosely associated thoughts on Keynes's \\"General Theory\\"<br /><br />1) The General Theory is a landmark work in the science of economics.  If you agree with the general conclusions or deny them, you cannot deny the influence of the work.  This is the same with Keynes as it is with Hayek or Friedman or Fischer or Marx or Smith.  This work, as the others, are part of the cannon.  Keynes was wrong in places.  He was right in others.  Different schools of thought may disagree on which place is which.<br /><br />2) Part of the power of the work is that it is set up in response to an orthodoxy that is no longer demode.  Poor professor Pigou is beat over the rocks for his poor understanding of economic phenomenon.  Pigou is a minor figure in history were Keynes not to attack him; instead he has an immortality that is undeniable.  The only possible problem here is that Pigou is a straw man, as most contemporary readers will have to rely on Keynes's characterization of Pigou's positions.<br /><br />3)  To get into terms of contemporary financial debate, Keynes was in favor of a financial transition tax, which we would propose as a \\"Tobin Tax\\" nowadays.  Not that I'm a Keynesian, but within the context of capitalism I tend to agree with the economists aligned with his tradition more than the other side(s).<br /><br />4) This is a big point, but Keynes acknowledges that the book is intended for professional economists.  There is a lot of stuff here that is opaque to the lay reader.  S/he might need a class on the topic to walk him/her through the arguments.  I know I had to brush off my calculus to get through large sections.  It might have better to have been on a white board.<br /><br />5)  However, a lot of the stuff is accessible.  Keynes is a good writer.  He had to be, considering the group he ran with.  He was the square in the hippy house, but a certain style is evident in his writing.  Though a large part of the chapters is devoted to the mathematical basis of his argument, he still explains what he is talking about.  This comes at the end of the chapters in surprising little nuggets.  You can't escape his beautiful metaphors, especially his most famous one about the market, where the function is to find \\"what average opinion believes average opinion to be\\".ument, he still explains what he is talking about.

B003Q6D2B4|5.0|It's a great movie. We've watched it at least 3 times. Great cast, great action and a lot of funny lines without being stupid. Not a boring moment in the whole movie!
B001TKD4ZI|5.0|I didn't expect much, as it was a freebie when I got the book.. I'm dying to continue the series at the moment and want to see how Roman manages to have children and how all the others find their mates and to what extent Vampirism is kept a secret
B002ZG999U|3.0|With the great cast I expected more from this movie. It was full of action but some of the scenes with Sylvester Stallone in action were almost painful to watch. I think his age is starting to show or they did not do a good job filming it. I would not buy it again.
B000EULJLU|5.0|I bought this the day it came out... so many years ago...and put it in my car stereo. It has only come out a few times, and has spent at least 95% of the time in there compared to my other CD's (even TOOL). It has been my favorite TOOL album since about six months after it came out, so yes it takes time to grow on you. It was awesome at first, but it only got better with each listen.<br /><br />The packaging is totally cool, it's 3D! It comes with an optical pair of lenses, that you look at pages in the book which come out in 3D. Stereoscopic, I believe. I can't wait to see what the next album will be packaged in.<br /><br />Right in Two is the best Tool song ever. Ever.
B004LRZ2YC|3.0|I guess I don't know what \\"horror\\" means anymore. I thought the movie was slow paced and for a movie called, \\"The Best American Horror film in 20 years\\" I just didn't see it. The movie as everyone else said is about an 11yr old boy who is bullied at school but forms a friendship with the mysterious stranger. There was nothing about this movie that stood out to me. I'm just happy I used a promo code for it or else I'd be wanting my $3.99 back
B00000099Y|5.0|This is Tool's first album to have a high production value, IMO. The previous two were awesome, but a bit under produced compared to the current TOOL standard. This ablum sits right in the middle, and has some great songs. 90% of the time I listen to TOOL is as a complete album play through, not piecemeal.<br /><br />Third Eye is just epic.
0307272702|5.0|I've read his other GCBC, and realize that this is somewhat of a layman's guide.    Gary IS 95% right, but I'll point out a few problems I have.  For the average American, insulin spikes from CHO is the main problem.  Too much low-fat, wrong headed advice from poorly formulated   epidemiological studies and too much frankenfood.    However, there are a host of other hormones at play, and for many  people with stubborn fat problems, even zero carb doesn't work.  I think the book fails to acknowledge that total calorie consumption  and exercise have an important SECOND ORDER effect on body weight,   along with things like stress, mood, environment, etc.    There are more recently discovered ways that your adipose cells can   absorb fatty acids even in the complete absence of insulin   (look up Acylation Stimulating Protein).      Another problem is the simple treatment of modern disease as entirely  caused by CHO consumption.   Heart disease is a multi, multi factor disease,   and the connection between insulin and it hasn't been nailed down.  Diet-wise, there is probably more of a connection with modern wheat than  sugar, and some suggestions that vegetable-oil vs. animal fat causes CHD.    Gary also doesn't address the whole cholesterol hoax, and makes a few  statements about such-and-such lowering bad cholesterol levels.  All the recent studies (SEAS, ENHANCE, GISSI, AURORA, JUPITER, etc)  show almost no connection between cholesterol-lowering and mortality  reduction.    Anyway, my gripes with the book are very minor and technical, and it   deserves to be read.

B000MRAAJM|4.0|I purchased this Planet Earth Blu-ray without seeing it prior to purchase.  I had heard such amazing comments from my friends that had watched it that I had to have it.  Once I started watching it I was a bit disappointed since it's a compilation of the best Nature snippets from BBC.  I'd already watched the majority of the 4 Blu-ray set and actually had another Nature BBC Blu-ray that had some of the exact same footage.  I still highly recommend this documentary because it's beautiful and touching.  The picture is so crisp and clear.  If you are an avid Nature watcher then be prepared to have watched the majority of this program.  The narration by David Attenborough is amazing and truly draws you into the magnitude and beauty of the Earth.

0670022411|3.0|I thought the first third of this book was original in plot and very well written.  The middle is when the plot began to sag and IMO, never recovered. Only a few characters ended up being well developed and their relationships became cloying unbelievable.  I think 1/3 of the book could easily have been edited out; I'll take a miss on the rest of the trilogy.  \\"The Radleys\\" is a much better read for adult vampire lit.
B001IBIHQ4|5.0|I have decided to buy this mini TV series for showing to my family and friends because some of us have experienced the horror and barbarism of the Imperial \\"Bungsai\\" Jap armies when they invaded my country of birth, then British Malaya in 1943. These savages inflicted harm, rape, plunder and massacre throughout South East Asia, until the two Jap cities - Hiroshima and Nagasaki were nuked at the expressed order of President Harry S. Truman thus these brutes sued for unconditional surrender.  There were then loud  cheers throughout the land of South East Asia when finally these brutes laid down their arms and bowed  to the landing couquerors...the British troops to which their fellow POWs were traumatized and tortured by the japs...Cheers!

Most of the recipies yield a 1 - 2 qt. amount, just perfect for my ice cream maker.  Can't wait to try them all out, well maybe not the beer ice cream.

1400063515|3.0|This book is full of good ideas, but is almost unreadable for the average person.  I tried to get my book club (all college grads) to read it, but they found wading through his sloppy syntax and muddled prose (despite his attempts to lighten it with shots at everyone from the French to Paul Samuelson) too much to bear.  None of them could stand to finish reading it or even finishing listening to the CD version.  The book could have been half the length with good editing.  He is self-absorbed and obviously has a huge ego; all of that stuff could be cut.  He mixes good examples with poor ones (e.g. the polio vaccines were discovered through deliberate efforts, not by chance or serendipity).  The Microsoft vs. Apple example was mentioned earlier.  If he had compared MS-DOS to CPM-80, that was a matter of pure luck.  I am glad he pointed out the Black & Scholes debacle.  Many of the ideas in this book are in \\"The Drunkard's Walk,\\" a book that is far more readable.  Overall, it was a drag to read, even with the fundamentally good message.  If I had not recommended it to my book club, I would not have bothered reading it all the way through myself.

B001N1DPDE|5.0|Overall, I think The KaBar Becker BK-2 \\"Campanion\\" is an excellent knife. I was very happy to find that KaBar is producing the Becker designs again. I like this knife so much I recently bought a second one for a back up. I bought my first for about $57 from Amazon.com. I think this is an excellent field/utility knife that would also certainly serve well in a survival situation.     It's a very robust knife, just a hair under 1/4 inch thick, full tang*, weighs about a pound or so, holds an edge well, and it's not too hard to sharpen. It's made of 1095 steel, coated with a smooth black protective coating. I have the second version, which has the tang extended slightly beyond the handle into a pommel useful for pounding. This is a very solid knife which holds up well to: cutting, slicing, scraping, chopping, batoning, and even digging, prying, hammering, and cooking. It is heavy.      The original handle scales are black \\"Grivory,\\" which is fiberglass impregnated nylon plastic, I believe. It's very light and strong and should be impervious to weather, but the handle scales are where I have my main criticisms. First, they are a comfortable shape and fit my hands well, but they are quite smooth. This can be easily fixed with some skateboard tape or other wrapping, or by scoring or checking the handle scales with a file or Dremel tool. Second, as many others have noted, the handle scales can come loose a little too easily. The scales are fixed to the knife with three hex-head bolts and nuts. Apparently these are not well-torqued at the factory. This can also be easily fixed in several different ways. Simply using a hex key wrench to tighten the bolts; or wrapping with tape or cord as I mentioned above also works. My solution was to remove the bolts and coat their threads with LockTite, then properly torque them down again. They haven't loosened at all since I did this.     The knife comes with a black Kydex sheath which holds the knife well and includes a nylon belt loopand retention snap strap, although the Kydex holds the knife very securely without the strap. The belt loop will fit belts up to five inches wide and is removable in case you want to attach the Kydex sheath to your gear with its grommets and slots. I believe the sheath would hold the knife securely without the retention strap even in a tip up position.     Finally, I'd like to add that although I'm very please with this knife as it came from the factory, I have modified it a bit. I replaced the handle scales with the Micarta version that KaBar sells about $40. They are a little heavier and of course they add quite a bit to the overall cost of the knife, but they do improve the grip, since they're \\"rougher\\" than the original Grivory scales. They fit perfectly with the original nuts and bolts, but as I said above I used LockTite on the bolts when I installed the Micarta grips. So far I'm very pleased with the improved grip. They also seem to slightly improve the sheath's grip on the knife, which was already very good. Of course, I also think they improve the appearance of the knife, giving it a more \\"organic\\" look and feel. I also added a short 550 cord lanyard.     *I said full tang above, and I believe it does meet this definition, but I did find, when I removed the scales, that the tang has two cutouts between the bolt holes. I suspect this was done to improve the balance of the knife. I don't believe this affects the structural strength of the knife at all.
1439102813|5.0|'Still Alice' is a very poignant and beautiful book about Alzheimer's Disease.  Alice, a Harvard professor of cognitive linguistics, is diagnosed with early onset Alzheimer's disease at the age of fifty.  This book is about the cognitive decline she faces along with the fact that she retains her essence, her deepest self, despite the disease.<br /><br />Alice's profession is all about language.  \\"She thought about the books she'd always wanted to read, the ones adorning the top shelf in her bedroom, the ones she figured she'd have time for later. [[ASIN:0199535728 Moby Dick (Oxford World's Classics)]]. She had experiments to perform, papers to write, and lectures to give and attend. Everything she did and loved, everything she was, required language.\\"  Alice isn't ready to become a victim of this disease or have others see her this way.  On the other hand, she can't stop the progression of the disease despite exercising, taking vitamins, anti-oxidants, and pharmacotherapy.  She realizes that at some point \\"she would forget how to eat an ice cream cone, how to tie her shoe, and how to walk.\\"  She'd be incapable of enjoying the things she loved.  No matter what the age of diagnosis, Alzheimer's eventually kills all who receive its diagnosis.<br /><br />The book examines how people with Alzheimer's are looked at as outcasts while people in our community with other diseases are supported and helped.  \\"She didn't want to become someone people avoided and feared.\\"  Alice puts a plan together that when the pain of the disease outweighs the pleasure she gets out of life, it's time for her to die.  She has a plan in place but when the time comes, will she have the faculties to use it?<br /><br />The interaction of Alice's family and its dynamic is carefully examined.  Alice's Alzheimer's is genetic and her children have a fifty-fifty chance of carrying the gene.  If they carry the gene then they have a 100% chance of getting the disease.<br /><br />Along with the novel and the beautiful story of Alice, the reader learns a lot about Alzheimers and the crippling effects it has on its victims.  I was especially taken that parts of the story were told in the first person with Alice discussing her own illness or listening to others discuss her as if she wasn't even in the room.  Her relationship with her children, especially her youngest daughter, is deep and powerful.<br /><br />This book is not only entertaining but it is consciousness-raising and educating.  I highly recommend it.he beautiful story of Alice, the reader learns a lot about Alzheimers and the crippling effects it has on its victims.

B0046MOVD0|5.0|I personally bought this item only because i already bought it in a local store here. Where they only sold the 3D version of the film. Which did not have any bonus features. While i am always intrested in movies which use a lot of effects and stuff like that, i really wanted to get more then just the film in 2D, 3D or real 3D. So i bought this \\"normal\\" version from Amazon. It did not disturb me at all that it did not have dutch subtitles, because i understand english with ease.    Overall, i like this blu-ray version more then the 3D one, simply because it has bonus stuff.    But i think it would have been better to have a special edition (steelcase?) with 2 discs. One with the 2D and real 3D film, and the other disc with bonus material.    But i got both now so im satisfied.    Kind regards.

We have had this on VHS for many years but it is extremely worn. This was just a another wonderful addition to our collection.
0810997827|5.0|Jeff Kinney is a genius.  He has captured the essence of being a kid.  Greg Heffley's adventures continue in these books.  I've read the earlier ones too.  They are meant for younger readers, but who cares?  I reckon they are better from an adult perspective, knowing that embarrassment can't kill you and no one except you will remember all the stupid things you did.  It also shows just how much parents don't get kids.  This was brought home to me in \\"Dog Days\\" when Greg's Mum organises a \\"Reading is Fun\\" Club.  Exactly.  The illustrations are perfect - a  few lines that add so much to the text.  Highly recommended.

0385342047|4.0|I've been a Kinsella fan since I read \\"Can you Keep a Secret\\" which is not part of the Shopaholic series, but still wonderful.  She writes with a breezy style that is laugh out loud funny.<br /><br />Beccy, who is the Shopaholic of the title, is warm hearted but scatty, coming up with one harebrained idea after another.  She means well but somehow others don't quite see the world as she does.  By this stage in the series she has acquired a lovely husband Luke and a cute daughter Minnie and has parlayed her addiction to designer wear into a great job as a personal shopper.  If you are already a fan, this book will not disappoint.  If you haven't discovered Beccy and her wacky ways, this is as good a place as any to start, and you'll be hooked like the rest of us.
B004EQAVHI|4.0|Spoilers:    The big secret in the film is actually revealed very early on and though not overly shocking, it still leaves you feeling morose about the whole thing. The movie follows three friends all the way from school where they are told constantly that they are 'special', to adulthood where their lives coexist once more until they reach a certain point in their life. Throughout the film, all three characters know what their purpose is in life and what we, the audience never know is, why nothing is ever done about it. Theirs is a difficult fate, but they treat the knowledge with a kind of indifference that left me cold. Why do they never run away? Is it because they have so little knowledge of the outside world? No money? No connections? How did they get to the school, and where did they come from? All unanswered questions, but it doesn't completely detract from the film.    Carey Mulligan just steals the spotlight in the subtle, yet endearing role of Kathy. Her heart was broken long ago by her two best friends, Tommy and Ruth, played by Keira Knightley and Andrew Garfield. She hides it well and continues to live day by day knowing there isn't anything she can do about the situation. On top of what is already planned for the trio, she is clearly still reeling from her unrequited love, so she decides to take a job as a Carer, the role that is explained further in the film. Once she takes the position, she doesn't see her friends for ten years. Once they are reunited however, it is clear that many things have changed.    I read someone's review that mentioned Never Let Me Go is just a bad remake of The Island. Well, how very wrong they are. The Island is just bad, the characters bland and robotic. Never Let Me Go is so much more than that. In this dystopian reality, the characters do not question their purpose, and they are not afraid. Though their lives may be limited, they still allow themselves to feel and to live and I think that is what makes the film so depressing because it really connects and resonates with viewers. This is not a film for everyone, it is slow-paced but never lacks for drama and emotion. I really wish it was more well-known because it truly is a little gem of a film.
B001N26GFM|5.0|I had read this book, and thought the movie was wonderful, I felt it was a wonderful way to show my children how the german people thought about the concentration camps, and they saw the typr of propaganda used to make them feel that they were doing the opposite of what they were doing.

B002TLSSXO|5.0|I loved the colors and the elevated lip at the back has come in handy.  No more nasty trivets or dirty countertops!  Also, I like to keep some of my utensils next to my stovetop in a utensil holder and this was a cute way to purge some of my old hand-me-downs and get something fun and functional on display.  They have held up well after some abuse too.  No discoloration, warping etc.      A difference I noted when using them is that the spoon is a bit shallow and the spatula is a bit narrow, but after working with them I actually like them this way.  It makes them a little more versatile.

0061726826|5.0|\\"Hearts are fragile things. That's why you have to be so careful.\\"     For seventeen years Lena has only known one world. A black and white world where it's one thing or another. People are either cured or uncured, there are praised regulators or hunted sympathizers, you either penned inside the electrified fence or an invalid in the Wilds outside of the fence. But the one aspect of her life that is neither black or white is love a deadly, infectious disease - Amora Deliria Nervosa - that has spread fear and panic.      For seventeen years Lena has been living a safe life, going to school and endlessly preparing for evaluation day, the day that determines the rest of her life: what she'll study at college and even who she will spend the rest of her life with. Until the day of her evaluation where a herd of unruly cows and a golden-haired boy botch up her evaluation. So much for getting that high score she was hoping for.But that wasn't even the strangest part. The strangest part was the golden-haired boy who stood overlooking the incident head tilted back laughing. Life suddenly changes for Lena, her safe life is about to become a whole lot more dangerous than she had planned.     Lena has found herself breaking curfew, sneaking out, and going to unauthorized parties - parties that have the potential of being raided, and worst of all wrapped in the arms dancing with the same golden-haired boy she saw at the labs - Alex. Lena should be worrying instead of dancing - worrying how that dancing alone, yet in a boys arms is a punishable federal offense, especially since she hasn't been cured yet. But at that moment Lena can't seem to think, care about that - all she could think is that the deadly deliria is slowly, surely sinking into her.      As their relationship spirals into something wild and wonderful all the fear the has built up inside of Lena suddenly dissipates. That is until this forbidden romance is found out. Will Alex and Lena's love for each other to keep them together, will Lena be sent to crypts to rot and die, or worse will she be sent to the doctors to be cured risking the possibility of losing, not only Alex, but also herself?    Lauren Oliver has written an original novel centered around a common concept: love. Delirium is a thought-provoking look into a society that is so fearful of love, that it is actually devoid of it. With the ability to stir up raw emotions, Oliver captures her audience, not just with an enticing storyline, but with her lyrical writing. Readers are bound to get swept into Lena's mind and world, it won't be long before readers themselves begin to feel the touch of deliria.     Told through Lena's perspective, her voice is real and inviting which will ultimately lead readers deeper and deeper into her life, personal thoughts, and the corrupted world she lives in. This is a story that readers will immediately gravitate towards because as similar as it is to the world we live in, it is vastly different. Evenly paced, Oliver builds a vivid world that readers can easily picture in their mind's eye.    Delirium is a heart-wrenching romantic suspense novel that will leave readers gripping their seats waiting to see what will happen to Lena with both fear and anticipation. Oliver really knows how to, not only instill emotion within her audience, but also feed off it at the same time.

0756404738|5.0|The Wise Man's Fear is a great book.  It is a great book of three parts.   The first part is that it exceeds any expections as a second novel by a beginning author with clear and marked development shown.  The second is the greatness of the words themselves.   They make even the casual reader pause and re-read a choice passage or phrase... savoring the feel of the prose like the taste of the topping on premium icecream.   Third, it is a greatness that you will find yourself recalling again and again, even to the point of writing a cheesy review on a web review section.

B0041KKYDI|2.0|I never felt that way. I love Danny Boyle but this movie was terrible. Maybe I have to rewatch it a few times. I did think The Beach was terrible the first time I watched it, along with 28 Days Later. Honestly, this movie disappointed me. Maybe James Franco was a bad choice to play Aron Ralston. I felt like I was in the cave a half hour. Honestly, this was a lazy effort. If someone expected Danny Boyle to work a miracle with this movie and make it entertaining, they should get their money back. There was absolutely no creativity. No one will remember this movie in 3 years. His mother was looking for him. The girls were sort of expecting him. Why not interject the movie with some flashback scenes, to take the viewer out of the cave, then interject them back into it, for emotional purposes?    I'm offended that this was nominated for any award.

They did a great job with the action, the storyline, and the acting was great, but if you were a fan of the original TV series........this was not the A-Team.  Nobody can replace Mr T (No offense Rampage).  Like I said the movie was good, but it just didn't feel right.  If you want to see a good action movie, then I recommend that you see it, but if you are a fan of the series, you might want to pass on this one.

This movie had a kick butt opening sequence and faded off from there.  It was like the writer had a great idea for a movie (the beginning sequence) and then had writers block after that.  I thought it was ok, but if you are not a fan of the series, I would just rent it.
0307455874|4.0|I checked this book out at the library and read it in two weeks.  I liked this book because Obama has given me a new perspective on liberals.  After reading this book, I understand why liberals hated George Bush.  They feel that him and other republicans overused their power when they they were in power and trampled on the Dems rights by refusing to compromise with them.  It is ironic that when the Dems took over the Presidency and both houses of Congress, you could honestly say the same thing about them.      I also liked the very end of the book when Obama talks about Michelle and his kids.  I never knew he was such a family man.    That being said, I disagree with Obama's viewpoints on how to save the country and help the less fortunate.  I truly believe that he does care about people who are suffering, but I don't believe that the government should get involved.  The people who lost their manufacturing jobs and were forced to take lessor paying jobs at Wal-Mart.  First of all, there is nothing wrong with working at Wal-Mart.  Secondly, you can get promoted at Wal-Mart.  Thirdly, if you really have to have a good paying job, why not leave the town you live in and move to an area where you can find a better paying job?  Why couldn't these people save while they were working at their better paying jobs for rainy days like this?  They know that the government will rescue them from their bad choices.  When the government continues to pay for unemployment, these people are forced to stay where they are at and are limited in their choices for jobs.  Plus, the people who are working have to pay taxes to support them.    When Obama talks about the government giving money to students for college, I was thinking about my own personal story.  I stayed with relatives, worked 22 hours a week, got a discount because one of my relatives worked at the college, and didn't take one cent from the government to pay for college.  I took summer classes every year for three years (if Iwould've gotten money from the government that wouldn't be possible) and I got a degree.  When I graduated I couldn't find a good paying full time job, and I was grateful that I didn't have student loans to pay off.  My point is that if I can do it without the government's help, others can too.  I finally did get a decent paying job and am now working to save for my daughter's college fund.  When the government says that they are going to pay for people's education, parents are less likely to save for it, so more people end up relying on the government.

B001QWBM62|5.0|I've had my H4n for a year now and am very happy with it. There is, however, one thing that anyone who needs fast access to the recorder should know. The H4n does a memory check during boot-up and the more memory you have the longer it takes. Boot time with 2GB is 11 seconds, but increases to 19 seconds at 8GB and a whopping 45 seconds at 32GB. All of my SD cards are Transcend and the 32GB is Class 10(fastest) while the smaller ones are Class 6(slower) , so that it is not a matter of memory speed, just the time it takes the H4n to do the check.

B003XF1XOQ|2.0|Overall a very poorly written conclusion to a promising trilogy.  It almost seemed as though this book was written by a completely different author!  There was very little character continuity or themes carried over from the previous two books in the series.  I loved the first two books, but honestly wish I had never read this one - it ruined the entire series for me.    Things that bothered me about this book (no spoilers):  *The character personalities have completely changed.  There is little reason to believe that the events of this book would be any more traumatic than those in the previous volumes to merit such complete changes.  *Little to no conclusion on either the personal or societal aspects to the trilogy.  *Long passages on inconsequential characters or events, which fail to move the plot forward or serve any purpose.  They just seem like they are there because the author needed to reach a certain word limit.  *Poor writing that leaves you confused about what is happening.  This never happened in the previous books.  *Unrealistic responses to trauma and death.  When people die (especially in YA books), loved ones mourn.  I understand that in times of war you become numb to death.  But this book took that a little far, in which mourning apparently doesn't exist.    I only gave this book 2 stars on behalf of the excellent predecessors in this series.  If you loved the first two books, do yourself a favor, and stay far away from this one.
B0042RJWTC|5.0|Such a lovely copy.  Box is well made and colors are great.  I would purchase from this seller again.  Fast shipment and well wrapped.
B002ZG98UA|4.0|Dont Remember How long it took to Come but now that I got it,I've watched it and everything is up to expectation.
B00004KD1L|3.0|Great CD to let plat from start to finish. Nice chill anmd relax music to play on any ocassion. At work as background music or at a small get together with friends. At The River is my favorite track so far.
3551551677|5.0|Harry Potter und der Stein der Weisen ist sehr gut! The book came earlier then expected which was fantastic and it was in excellent condition. However it was not a first edition so a bit dissapointing, but I suppose it would cost more money for a first edition. Otherwise I was very impressed.
B002ZG976U|1.0|This movie totally ripped of the movies Showgirls, Cabaret and Chicago.  The only difference was those 3 films were fantastic.  I have never been a fan of Christina Aguilera.  In my oppinion she over-sings and her voice can be used as an alarm on an alarm clock.  I had to plug my ears throughout this movie.  There was no character devolpment in any of the characters and the dialogue was amatuer at best.  Totally cliched and streotypical.  You could actually predict what the next person was going to say.  I also didn't like how the \\"dancers\\" in this movie resembled nothing but cheap strippers and prostitutes.  There was no class or sophistication with any of them onstage.  They all reminded me of The Pussycat Dolls, yuck.  I love Cher and I really only enjoyed seeing her.  Too bad she had to be in this terrible movie.  The music was awful as well.  I think I would have liked this movie better if Britney Spears played the lead.  To some it up, I still remember the part when Xtina Aguielera was was seeing the Burdancers for the first time in the club and tears welled up in her eyes.  All I was thinking at that point is what she wanted to say or was thinking and that is \\"I want to be a hooker just like them.'
1594202842|5.0|I was really curious to read this book because there had been sooooo much buzz over it. I was pleasantly surprised. Though I felt that some of the language was simple, perhaps even a little dry, I felt that the story that unfolded was entertaining. In the end, this Tiger mom learned a lot, and her daughters excelled in life.<br /><br />I think that for people who anticipate being mothers, it is a great read, and for those who are into literature, this is likewise a good read. It taught me a lot of how the other half lives...especially the Chinese-American lifestyle and the paradox that they face in self-identification.<br /><br />I also couldn't help but agree with some of Chua's assertions about how American parents are lazy in their efforts of discipline, however, I do not believe in the extent of her rigidity. But the fact that so many American children come out entitled and without discipline cannot be overlooked.
B00080DIWE|5.0|I use this for airbrushing my scale models. Works as advertised. The only thing I wish it had is a clip system in the center of the flat stand to hold motorcycle frames etc for painting. I end up using wall poster tack to hold it on and it works great. I would suggest this for any scale modeler who uses an airbrush.
B0042JTDXK|2.0|I've been a fan of Josh Grobin and his magnificent voice since first seeing him on Ally McBeal years ago.  I look forward to each album, but Illuminations is a disappointment and just not up to par with his others.  I find it to be a very dark, depressing collection of work (though I love \\"War at Home\\").  I sincerely hope he returns to inspiring music with his next release.
0312360266|4.0|When I saw the French translation of the book, I knew I had to read it in English -- I'm a French who never read a translation from English. Some YA books are so cliché -- all the more when the story takes place in a school -- that I wasn't sure at first this one would be better, but, after reading it, all I have to say is: try it, it won't deceive you.    Here is the summary:    \\"When sixteen-year-old Zoey is marked by the Tracker, she knows her old life is over. Now she has to leave her friends and family to join the House of Night school, where there's only one subject Zoey needs to study: Vampire 101.    Of course, there's always a catch, and this one's nice and simple: if you fail, you die . . .\\"    First of all, the cover: it's sober, elegant, and the pattern of the UV spot varnish made me think of a fence. Maybe to depict Zoey's imprisonment: the school isn't just that, it's also a prison where students can die -- not quietly -- if they weren't really supposed to become vampyres, and a place to begin anew -- every student can change his first name when arriving, some of them show real bad taste.    Zoey is part Cherokee by her grandmother, and it has its importance because the Native American's god Nyx come to her after she was marked to give her powers. What does \\"marked\\" mean? She was chosen to become a vampyre, or to die. To say that her mother doesn't take the news well would be a huge understatement . . . she'd rather let her daughter die than to see her go to the vampyre's school. She even calls the familial shrink to \\"help\\" Zoey. Problem is: Zoey will die if she doesn't go to the school, so, she flees to her grandmother's -- an understanding woman -- who saves her by leaving her alone at the House of Night school.    The school, the school, I mention it everywhere, but, what is it exactly? A place where each student has a counselor: Zoey inherit Neferet, who is also the High Priestess of Nyx, the Goddess of vampires. But it's also a place where the students too feeble to become vampyres die. Zoey finds friends in her roommate and her friends -- who really are clichés -- and enemies in the Dark Daughters and Sons -- the local brotherhoods, thanks to the High Priestess in training, Aphrodite. She doesn't like the fact that Zoey shows more power than she during the monthly ceremonies.    Here is a short list of the problems encountered by Zoey at school: her \\"human\\" ex, her \\"human\\" ex-best-friend, a new love, new social rules, etc . . .    I'm eager to read the Second Book of Zoey's adventures and to tell you what I thought about it!    Here is the link to this review on a French website specialised in fantasy and sci-fi reviews: [...]
B002TLSSXO|5.0|Very innovated and love the fact that they all come in different colors.  No more hunting in drawer after drawer for the correct utensil.
B003VR5PPY|5.0|Excellent game, Excellent story, characters, everything is cool, game play suits very well for the DS and I must say this is one of the few games rated M for the DS, great game.
0670022411|5.0|Just received it and have not read it yet! WHY they<br />want me to review it is beyound me!!
1582701709|4.0|THE BOOK REVEALED SOME THINGS THAT YOU CAN ACTUALLY TRY FOR YOURSELF.  iT MAKES YOU MORE AWARE OF YOUR SURROUNDINGS, BUT THE SURPRISING THING ABOUT THE BOOK IS IT DIDN'T REALLY MENTION THE CREATOR AND SOME OTHER THINGS i DIDN'T AGREE WITH BECAUSE IT MADE IT SEEMED LIKE IF YOU FOLLOW THAT BOOK YOU COULD FORGET ABOUT DEPENDING ON WHAT'S IN THE BIBLE.
B001IF252M|5.0|Since this is one of the only adapters you can get, and its from Apple, of course it works great. Really easy to use and hook up. Your Mac automatically recognizes it as soon as you plug it in.
B000R8YC18|5.0|Pretty short review here, as the title of my review pretty much says it all.      I recently watched for the first time in years this movie along with \\"Five Easy Pieces\\", and \\"Dog Day Afternoon\\"    The contrast in the the quality of these films and the acting in them by De Niro, Nicholson, and Pacino respectively was almost shocking in comparison to most of the movies/performances by these actors in recent years  (with maybe a couple of exceptions here and there).    Does anyone else remember when these guys were actually actors??
0670022411|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book.  It kept me interested from the first page and I could not put it down.  I hope this is the first in a series of books and not the only one about this family, because I would like to read more about their adventures.
0756404738|5.0|Simply said, The Wise Man's Fear (TWMF) is amazing.<br /><br />The second book is a clear continuance of the first, unlike some sequels which seem to entirely switch styles. I am thinking, of course, about The Hobbit to The Lord of the Rings and The Sorcerer's Stone to The Deathly Hallows disparity.<br /><br />The most recommendable quality of TWMF, though, is its ability to connect to the reader. For instance, it made me weep as it poked at my broken, tender parts only my closest family and friends have ever seen. I laughed as if TWMF were my best friend telling me jokes only we understood. And, I was truly and utterly terrified of the Cthaeh, though this may not be the case for everyone.<br /><br />I, however, would gladly jump into the book, burn the Cthaeh alive, and slit my own throat afterwards to keep the rest of the world from its poison.<br /><br />On a less dramatic note, I thank Mr. Rothfuss for his familiar and gentle wrapping up at the end of his books. If it were not done thusly, I would go crazy with grief over the fact I had finished his books and must wait for the next one to come out. As it is, though, I am filled with wonderful reminiscences of the Adem, an urge to do my yoga and grappling techniques, and a burning curiosity about sign language.<br /><br />Glean from this what you will. It is, after all, a freely given gift offered without obligation, let, or lien.
B003L7DK74|5.0|I just love these guys.  My stepson turned me on to them and after seeing a few episodes I couldn't wait to see the rest.  I'm sorry they stopped making them!  They're funny, witty, unique...really out there.  None of the fluff Hollywood adds to productions.  Much more raw and real.  More Janis Joplin than Julie Andrews, y'know?
B0038BBA4I|5.0|It's not often you find an album you can listen to over and over and over (and over) again.  Here it is...
B004EBT5CU|5.0|Adele just gets better and better with age.  Now, I am a HUGE fan of her debut album `19', and it's a rarity for an artist with such a defining debut to actually come back and surpass all expectations with their sophomore album.  Even Damien Rice, who is above and beyond superb, couldn't top `O' with `9'.  Well, `21' is, quite possibly, the best album I own...and I own `19', so guess what that means?<br /><br />Yup, Adele tops her best with this collection of beautifully focused and executed GEMS.<br /><br />If you aren't familiar with Adele, then you really need to acquaint yourself right away.  From her smoky British accent to the way her voice separates when she reaches the heights of her vocals, piercing the heart as well as the eardrums (in a good way), it's just a total joy to listen to her.  She is one of the best artists working today, delivering a great homage to the late great jazz and blues singers of yesteryear while adding her own modern spin, enough to elevate her material and make her relevant and accessible.<br /><br />Just listen to the blistering opener, `Rolling In the Deep', for further proof that this girl has it all.<br /><br />`21' features a lot of softer moments for Adele.  `Someone Like You' closes the album with one of my favorite songs from the artist.  With a piano laden musical arrangement, Adele laments over the loss of a lover who has moved on with sincerity and beautifully registered remorse.  `Don't You Remember' adds elements of folk rock, giving her a bit of a country vibe (which suits her beautifully).  The way her voice rockets skyward on the chorus is impeccable.  `Take It All' reminds me of `19' a lot.  It is beautifully sung, but I the midst of `21's impeccable lineup, the track feels like filler to me (but that's just me).  Still, soft, sincere and beautiful to the ears.  `Turning Tables' is stunning, totally highlighting Adele's silky voice with a simple yet stirring musical arrangement.  You can feel her frustrations within the relationship she is lamenting, her voice delivers so much emotion.<br /><br />I just LOVE `Set Fire to the Rain'.  It is such a brilliantly crafted track, delivering an almost pop sound throughout the verse structure, emphasizing Adele's accessible vocals (and giving her relevance in this pop obsessed culture) but then she hits the chorus that is so far superior to any and all pop tracks released by these `Pop Princesses' today (the control she manifests on every word is BEYOND stunning).<br /><br />There are still the bouncy jazz throwback songs here, like `Rumour Has It', that just color this album with such playfulness.  I love the apparent Motown influences on `Rumour Has It', a song that is just so much fun.  `He Won't Go' is certainly catchy, and the R&B vibe just settles so nicely on Adele.  I love `I'll Be Waiting', which reminds me a lot of something Anthony Hamilton (love him) and Joss Stone (love her) would conjure up if they ever collaborated.  The soulfulness, almost gospel quality, is just undeniable.<br /><br />And that brings me to the best and worst.<br /><br />The worst, for me, is the cover of `Lovesong', and this isn't to say that it is bad because it isn't.  My only complaint is that I've heard it covered much better by other acts.  In fact, both 311 and Snake River Conspiracy have covered this song with vastly different yet equally brilliant results.  Adele sings it beautifully, but it just seems too simple to really stand out as impressive.  The best, for me, is `One and Only'.  Seriously, the song gives me chills.  I instantly think of the late greats when I hear this song, the aged (vintage) quality of the track just drips all over my eardrums, and that chorus is so pristine, so heart-swelling; I can't help but fall head over heals for it.  The growl in her voice just adds so much emotional umph to the song, and the message is relayed with ease yet and earnestness that swells in her heart and mine.<br /><br />So, I think you know whatI think you should do right about now...BUT THIS ALBUM!<br /><br />For those of you interested; my ranking:<br /><br />1) One and Only<br />2) Rolling In the Deep<br />3) Someone Like You<br />4) Set Fire to the Rain<br />5) Turning Tables<br />6) Rumour Has It<br />7) Don't You Remember<br />8) I'll Be Waiting<br />9) He Won't Go<br />10) Take It All<br />11) Lovesongyou interested; my ranking:    1) One and Only  2) Rolling In the Deep  3) Someone Like You  4) Set Fire to the Rain  5) Turning Tables  6) Rumour Has It  7) Don't You Remember  8) I'll Be Waiting  9) He Won't Go  10) Take It All  11) Lovesong
B000U1ZV8K|5.0|I am not reviewing the movies in this DVD, the have been out for years, what I'm saying this 4 movies in one DVD package, the entire Lethal Weapon series is an great deal, at a very low price. Good extras too.
B002XTBEDI|5.0|Both Cranford and Return to Cranford are very entertaining.  Great for Family. The story and cast were wonderful.  I recommend this film to anyone.  BBC did a great job on this one.
B0002Z0EYA|5.0|I bought this as a gift for my father who had not seen the movie.  He recently watched and was in love!
B00275EHJG|5.0|This is a fantastic movie.  The kids can't get enough of it, and I find myself watching it with them whenever it is on.  It is very witty and fun for all ages!
B001GCUER0|5.0|Mad Men is my guilty pleasure.  My brother gave me season 1 for Christmas '10 and I immediately purchased 2 & 3.  Currently waiting for season 4 that I pre-ordered a month ago and won't get until April.  DVDs came in perfect condition and shipping was very fast.  No complaints whatsoever.
0764113496|4.0|Good book. Contains all of the conjugations for each and every verb. The only thing that would make a revision better would be to include a sample sentence for each verb with the translation to help learners of this language
B002ZG994U|5.0|I work in a library that has dvds for rent after seeing this film I liked it so much that I just had to have it .I have since watched it several times. I love fun movies and this is one of them. I also love getting them for a good price.....AND DID
0385343248|5.0|There is no better author than James Clavell.  All of his books are top of the line.  Once you get started, it is hard to stop.
B00064WSNW|5.0|This is one of my all time favorite albums.It's an awesome album from start to finish.  I hadn't listened to it for a while and once I got it just couldn't stop hitting repeat.  I forgot how GREAT this album is.  I HIGHLY recommend it.
B001UV4XUG|5.0|What impressed me the most is that this movie is unlike any other. It doesn't end like you expect it to, nor does it have the happiest ending. Both of the main actors are interesting and take some time getting used to, but I found they fit their parts perfectly. Before purchasing this though, I would recommend renting it first. If you like really happy endings, then this probably isn't for you. It's one of the first things that's said in the movie: \\"This is not a love story.\\" This movie is very different, but that's why I love it. It's become one of my favorites because it grabs your attention and gives you something unexpected.
B00364K6YW|2.0|Pride and Prejudice is a wonderful story, and Colin Firth is great.  The original was beautiful, but the color on this dvd is terrible.  I sent it back.
0439023483|5.0|I'm probably a bit older than the intended audience from this book being in my mid 30s, however I enjoyed every minute I spent reading this series. I was concerned at first reading the first book that it was dangerously close to being a teenage version of The Running Man, but it's so packed with so many vividly wonderful characters and completely new ideas you really can't say that at all. The pacing of the books is also fantastic. Your heart will race as the main character fights for her life. In fact, all of the characters are really well written and thought out, it's hard to not get close to them by the end of the books making your eyes sting a bit every time they get hurt or die.
B00133KFGW|5.0|Bought this movie for a friend and they love it so much. Ordered form amazon.com and got so much in return.
044654146X|5.0|A good book. Jam-packed with new knowledge, it combines history while simultaneously explaining why Israel is how it is today economically. The stories brought up are vivid and still come to my mind now.
0756404738|4.0|I really enjoy PR's writing style.  He is very clever, has a great sense of humor, and passionate as well.  I enjoyed reading about the primary character's development and meeting some new people in that world.  I think this series has incredible promise but I hope PR does not get caught up in excessive prologue.  There were aspects of the book that did not seem to really move the story along and were somewhat repetative.  I also think it would have been nice if he hadn't telegraphed the story arc regarding his Aunt quite so blatantly.  Make us work a little bit!  I have no idea how long this series is going to be.  I know the story is supposed to take 3 days, but that will only bring us to the present day, and the present day seems like it is in a helluva fix so my guess is more books after that?  Please, don't drag this out for several decades (yes, I'm talking about GRRM and RJ here)! I did like how a few chunks of story (the trial and his trip to the Maer notably) were excised but with the possibility of a return once PR's kids might go to college!
0316098337|4.0|Pros:  * Easy read  * Original topic  * Great \\"food for thought\\" about various subjects, such as breastfeeding, the meaning of freedom, isolation, imprisonment, human trafficking, child safety/overprotection, wastefulness, how parents and adults explain the world to children and how they interact with children, how media is used, etc.    Cons:  * Narration in five-year-old voice was confusing and hard to read through, at first, but you get used to it.  However, you may continue questioning why the narration is childlike in some passages and too \\"grown up\\" in others.  So, there's a lack of consistency.  * Due to the narration choice, the \\"food for thought\\" mentioned above is either underdeveloped or not developed whatsoever.  Perhaps if the mother's voice had been used more, the subjects could have been more deeply explored.  Then again, it's fiction, not philosophy.      Overall, a great read.  Though, a bit depressing if you think about how this \\"story\\" is a grim reality for women and children who are abducted worldwide.
B003UESJF6|5.0|My eight yr old son an I  came back from our gym workout to find this movie @ our door.  We had been trying to rent this on our cable channel(the say they have Movies first..lol)My son was so excited,but it was almost bed-time.  I made him a deal that if we hurried we could start the movie an finish it after school. The Movie was so good, an  had a good teaching to be told( good over evil,an about feelings)  That we just went on with the Movie to the end. (We never stay up for movies.)  This was a good movie which im sure will be watched again an again.  I already have grandchildren lined up to get to grandma's  house to see MEGA MIND...........Thank-you again  Amazon for having fast release of new movies. We won't be depending on our cable network for that anymore......
B002VECM6S|5.0|My husband wanted to go see this in the theatre, thinking that just because Sandra Bullock was in it (one of my favorite actresses) I would want to see it.  I'm sorry to say I didn't go (my loss), but happy to report that this movie is now in my top 10 movies of all time.  Why?  Because it doesn't focus on football, but on what it means to be charitable and to have integrity AND it does it without crude rude humor and foul language (both seem to be major features of other sports-movies).      The movie has just enough football that it added to the story rather than dominated it.  They get double points in my book for injecting humor into the usually boring practice sessions (loved it when he stopped practice to look at the balloons).      The movie was well cast.  I was surprised how at how good Sandra Bullock looks as a blonde.  It was nice to see her eyes and pleasant to see her in a role where her wardrobe suited her - a major upgrade from her usual roles.  Her accent sounded natural to me and she did a great job in the acting department.      I didn't really know much about Tim McGraw, but had rather low expectations in light of those who have tried before to cross over from music to acting.  It was a pleasant surprise to discover he has talent.  I also watched his episode of \\"Who Do You Think You Are\\" because of his role in \\"The Blind Side\\" to see the 'real' Tim and enjoyed that as well.     Quinton Aaron, the young man that played Michael Oher, did a great job!
B000AQBAUI|5.0|Right Up there with some of the Best 70's Bands Ever. The original record just sold on eBay for $4,300.00  US dollars. The UK Hard rockers that came from a blues background. With a great singer, Peter French who was on Atomic Rooster-In Hearing Of. This CD is Very Heavy And Very Good. When you hear it \\"CRANK IT UP AND BLOW YOUR DOORS OFF\\"
0143118706|2.0|To begin with Committed is barely what anybody would consider to be a follow up to EPL. If you were in love with EPL and were just looking for an extension to where her story had left off, you won't find it here. Committed is a weak compilation of her research on marriage and her whiny diatribes on why she isn't fit for the institution. I barely got through this and kicked and screamed the whole time.    There is no way that this book can truly even be defined as a memoir. In all reality this would have made a better diary entry than literary work. Don't read this book just to satisfy your nostalgia of EPL, you may ruin it.
B00002ND77|1.0|Great acting by Denzel but the movie was over three hours long, far too long for a movie about a man that could have been summed up in five minutes. Didn't get the Rodney King beating at the beginning since it happened much later after X died, maybe Spike wanted to sensationalize? That's what he is good for. Just in case you do not want to spend three and a half hours watching a boring movie I will sum it up for you:<br /><br />- Malcolm X was obviously a confused man, banging white women and then telling others that it was the \\"white man\\" trying to seduce blacks...<br /><br />- Malcolm X was a definitely a racist and a radical and deserved every bit of harassment he endured, hate goes around and comes around.<br /><br />- Malcolm X degraded other black leaders notably Dr. King calling him an \\"Uncle Tom\\" and preached against his non violent protests. Even though Dr. King was fighting for rights in the South while Malcolm was safe from most of the racism in Chicago and NY.<br /><br />- If you watch some of his later clips you could see and hear the hate in his voice instead of the portrayal of him being more humble and changed at the end of the film as spike did.
B002ZG993Q|4.0|Definitely one of those movies he likes to make that few people would want to watch. George said he now has the clout to make these kinds of movies and this is a perfect example. It is surely not the flash bang of a Michael Bay extravaganza or a romantic comedy or a typical spy thriller.<br /><br />I would have to classify it as a thinking person's thriller. George plays a kind of assassin who makes specialized weapons for other assassins. He is extremely paranoid and with good reason. The problem with this piece is that a whole lot of nothing happens for a good bit of the movie. It is slow. Yet at the same time, there is really a lot going on. It just creeps up on you. As he hides out in the small Italian town, he does this one last job. He is warned by his handler not to make any friends, which he does anyway. That gives me the impression that the hooker he meets and falls for is a dead woman walking.<br /><br />Someone is leaking his location and as the movie progresses, it becomes clear that there are only so many characters it could be. Is it the priest that befriends him? Is it the hooker he falls for? Is it the female assassin he is making the weapon for?<br /><br />What I didn't like is the final scene that a glass-is-half-empty person would say is a bummer ending, while a glass-is-half-full person would say well... maybe, just maybe... As the audience, we suffer through all the slow buildup for that? I know many people would get angry at the slap in the face, while others would say \\"What do you expect?\\" In a way, I hate movies like this one. Still, there were things about it I liked well enough to go above three stars. I will not go as far as five because of the ending. I loved the European scenery. After living in Spain for 10 years, it all feels very familiar to me.<br /><br />If you are into artsy thinking-type movies and don't mind ambiguous endings, you might like this one. Otherwise, you're probably better off going for something a little less ambiguous.
B0018OASZE|5.0|Such a great record and sounds even better on vinyl. i would recommend this for any one who likes music, it spans so many different genres and Adele's voice is stunning.
B001IF252M|4.0|lower that Apples price and easy to use.    Just plug in and it works well w/ you laptop and Tv.
B003UESJFG|4.0|I think the easiest way for me to sum up if I feel whether or not this is worth watching or not is to say this:  my bf and I both like animated movies but he far more so than I do (or at least he's way ahead in watching them than I).  We both like comics though I am way ahead in reading them than he is.  We decided to pop this disc in late one night bordering dangerously close to his bedtime, I was far more interested in seeing it than he was.  He informed me if he got too tired or if it couldn't hold his interest, no worries, he'd not be offended if I watched it without him / didn't want to break it up into a two day movie spree.  He watched it in one sitting and only got up when they broke into dance and song at the last minute just as the credits were starting.<br /><br />You really don't need to know much of it -  It tackles most of the oldest  questions that lead to debates amongst comic nerds, most notably:  What will the villain do if he truly rids himself of the good guy to battle?<br /><br />Its one part original movie, one part spoof / tribute to the good old classics we all know and love, one part super predictable.  Mix those together and you oddly enough get a really fun movie, but only if you really like the comic book / super hero genres in general probably.
0307001466|4.0|As an artist I would purchase this book for reference, but I got it as a gift for my friend's little niece that reminds me of the one illustrated here. Of'course I had to take a peek at the work, and Mary Blair is always timeless and her artwork here is a great example of her non-Disney material.  The only criticism I have is of the construction* of the book, I guess in today's market the price I paid for a mid century reprint somewhat justifies its quality. However, I would have given 5 stars had it not been for this.     *I feel that proper care is required.  I can already see the gold outer binding falling apart in the near future, and the pages were not aligned with the front and back hardcover and protruding out.
B004EBT5CU|5.0|I am an Adele fan and I have enjoyed her music from day one. 21 is a great followup album to 19. Her vocal styling is showcased as always and she gives us I do enjoy it when she incorporates her own interpretations of well known songs like she did before with Dylan's \\"To Make You Feel My Love\\" and this time around it is \\"Lovesong\\" I appreciate artists writing what they know and at 21 Adele knows a thing or two about heartbreak and regret but not in an overly melancholic way. Some of my stand out faves are He Won't Go, Lovesong, and Someone Like You.
0670022411|5.0|This is a fantastic beginning for a new tale into the world of witches, vampire, daemons and even us humans.  I can see the history professor in the writing and as a lover of history, this brings depth to this novel.    I enjoyed the interaction good and bad between the characters, and found the coversations very interesting.  Harkeness writes like people speak, fast and furious sometimes and others at a slower pace, and there is the stillness between the lead characters that leads to your own visual interpretation of the moment.  This novel was a visual feast of writing.  Writing should make mind pictures and this novel does that.  Heaven only knows how this could be written as a screenplay.  Can hardly wait for the next chapter.
B003AO1SVS|5.0|There is not a single weak track on this entire album.  This is my first Black Key's album, but it won't be my last.  Fantastic.
B00000DOZ0|2.0|Despite the enormous reputation, this album is a failure. Although some of the material is quite nice, like 'Turn of the century', a whimsical medieval song, generally the performing and production is sloppy.    On most of the songs the band's playing is rushed and Jon Anderson is singing as fast as he can to keep up. Some songs, like 'Parralells' are a complete rambling mess. Go on! Say I'm just a prog-hater who doesn't get it. But that's just an excuse for weak, messy songs that aren't performed well, even if they are 'complex' or 'prog' or whatever,    The sound on this album is really bad. The vocals are somewhere in the background (can't comment on the remasters and stuff) and some slushy mix of bass/guitar/synths are all whirling around in the foreground as fast as they can.     'Awaken' is a nice song that needs a better performance than this one, although it is still good here. It is a 15 minute 'epic' with some beautiful instrumental sections and is a well-written melodic song, some powerful moments. However, I like the ballads 'Turn of the century' and 'Wondrous stories' even better, mainly because they do a better job of performing and arranging them.     Overall, a weak album, but some good moments, some good inspiration, so maybe it deserves an average rating. Rating **
0062020889|5.0|Ken Follett is one of my favorite writers, and this book does not disappoint. I was enthralled in the story from the first page. The story line involves a conflict between Israelis and Arabs in 1968, and is full of turns and twists that will keep you on the edge of your chair. This is a highly entertaining book and I recommend it.<br /><br />Ali Julia review
142312166X|5.0|I love the percy jackson series, and this was great. It has a lot of extra information on the characters and it has 3 short stories that haven't been published before. I really liked all the short stories, one was better than the others, but the all added more knowledge to the overall series. and one of the stories adds information to the new series \\"the heroes of olypmus\\" I really enjoyed this book, and would recommend it to fans of the series
B001AQO3Z6|5.0|It's true, there is no conventional plot or vocalized narration.  So what!  Koyaanisqatsi is a non-stop epic sequence of cinematic vision with an awe-inspiring musical score.  This movie is almost designed to test the limits of Blu-Ray!    Design elements from Koyaanisqatsi laid the foundation for movies made even today.  From visual sequences to musical scores Koyaanisqatsi pushed the limits of film.  Musical score from Philip Glass; Fancis Ford Coppola as an executive producer - you can't go wrong!    The content in this film is as valid today as it was in 1982.  It is already digitized to 1080i.      We've waited long enough.  Please MGM, it's time for Koyaanisqatsi on Blu-Ray.
0525423273|5.0|Reviewed for [...]<br /><br />I'm not sure where I first heard of Anna and the French Kiss, but everything I have heard has been positive. Actually, positively glowing would be more like it. While I don't review many YA books for My Comfy Chair, my curiosity was piqued, so I picked up a copy.<br /><br />At its base structural level, this is pretty standard YA romance fare with heartthrobs and heartbreak and misunderstandings. What raises this book so far above its genre is the sheer appeal of its characters, and the believability of their reactions to the people and situations they face.<br /><br />Anna Oliphant is looking forward to her senior year of high school in Atlanta, but her newly famous father decides to send her to a boarding school in Paris. Rough life, but Anna isn't happy to leave behind her best friend and familiar life. What follows is a blend of humor and melodrama as Anna falls for the gorgeous &Eacute;tienne St. Clair with his to-die-for English accent and his very steady girlfriend. He even seems to like her back, but throughout the tumultuous, emotional year, they can't seem to get on the same page.<br /><br />As I said, standard fare, except that Stephanie Perkins has imbued these characters with all of the anguish, but little of the angst, of real teenagers coming of age and sorting through their feelings for parents, friends and love interests. Instead of rolling your eyes as the latest complication keeps Anna and &Eacute;tienne apart, you find yourself cheering them on.<br /><br />There is enough sexual tension that very young teens might be uncomfortable, but not enough that parents need worry. After all, what Anna longs for is indicated in the title. You'll have to read the book to see if she gets it.<br /><br />I heartily recommend this for teenage girls who will love both the exotic &Eacute;tienne and the city of Paris which provides a backdrop to the story, although not from a tourist point of view, but a teenager in a strange land point of view. I even think teenage boys might be interested, if only to get a glimpse of what the girls around them are really like. Of course, I couldn't blame any parents who picked this up and couldn't put it down again either. I was supposed to save it for a trip, and couldn't stop reading it.<br /><br />Five Stars!to get a glimpse of what the girls around them are really like.

0451147960|3.0|I am a big fan of Ken Follett, I read every single book he wrote. I was excited to find this book written early in his career, a book I have not read before. But I found it boring. It was the only book of his that I have not finished.  Some day I might take it with me on vacation where I would be forced to finish it by not having any other options...
B003XF1OJK|5.0|I loved this book. Eric did great in writing it. i read this book without playing the game and still loved it!!! Full of action and adventure it is a MUST READ!!!!!
1439102724|5.0|Wow. I'm still breathless after finishing this book. Ms. Picoult has been one of my favorite writers for a long, long time, and I look forward to each of her books. This one doesn't disappoint in any way. The story is graphic in many ways and hard to read simply because it's so powerful. You feel for (almost) all of the characters. And the ending made my head spin. It was simply perfect. Thank you, Ms. Picoult, for having the courage to write a wonderful book about a controversial subject. This is one of my top ten books of all time.
1594202842|4.0|Dear Amy,<br /><br />Thank you for writing your story. I am inspired. Mostly by your brutal honesty. This dilemma has plagued me for years. I see the failure in the 'western' model. And I see the wrong of the 'Chinese' model. The terms 'western' and 'chinese' are both stereotypes and don't represent everyone. There is widespread acknowledgement, even in the book, of this fact.<br /><br />Parental leadership, a child's free will, and the influence of the world, all together makes for one difficult task with so many differing approaches and philosophies. I don't agree with Amy Chua's choices but commend her for putting her story out there for transparency, to be corrected and criticized.<br /><br />Amy Chua writes with candor and wit her tribulations on the home front trying to steer her two daughters toward personal success using 'Chinese model' parenting techniques that horrify the typical American. I found myself laughing out loud, sharing passages with my own family.<br /><br />Truly, being a mother always makes one vulnerable to attack because there are strong opinions of opposition. Please readers, lay them all aside. It's worth the read just for cultural awareness.
B000WGWQG8|5.0|Thank you for sending my John Adams series ontime. The quality is 'like new' as claimed and I am very happy with my order. Your the best!
B0041KKYDI|5.0|This is one of the most compelling films I've EVER seen, and, so far, I've seen it four times.  Word of mouth seems to label \\"127 Hours\\" as a movie about a guy who cut off his arm; it's SO much more.  Aron Ralston's courageous story of survival, determination, hope, good and bad fortune, glory, and love of family, adventure and the environment along with revival and rebirth is the most inspiring and glorius episodes I have encountered.  From his near death prophetic visions, to his struggles with the elements & lack of food and water to his creative handling of his close encounter with death, I found this film a well produced, amazingly acted and perfectly directed retelling of one man's struggle with the elements that brought challenges that even the most determined outdoorsman could overcome, let alone survive.  The screen play is as imaginative, inspiring and emotional as Mr. Ralston's book, BETWEEN A ROCK AND A HARD PLACE. It's rather sad that due to lack of cinematic time, the film ends with Aron's triumphant rescue, since many new challenges awaited him, like Aron's stuggle with bone infections, which are inspiringly detailed in his book. Without a doubt, \\"127 Hours\\" is now my favorite pieces of cinema creativity, along with Aron Ralston's inspiring life and epic story of survival and living.  As far as the DVD release goes, it's a gem...at least the blu ray edition I got from Amazon is!  Commentary by Danny Boyle, Christian Colson & Simon Beaufoy is revealing, fun, informative and appropriate!  Deleted scenes are interesting, and include a very lengthy and more detailed alternative ending (although it's wonderful to see, the ending used was the appropriate one); the \\"Search & Rescue\\" featurette features the real Aron Ralston, his mother, and various other actual people from the absolutely timely and miraculous salvation of the amazing Mr. Ralston, who must have more character than most others on earth...for instance, when the chopper landed to take the exhausted, near-dead, dehydrated, hiker away, Aron was worried about soiling the helicopter's seat with his blood; \\"127 Hours:  An Extraordinary View\\" is another wonderfully detailed featurette that is an involved and interesting 'making of...' document.  I still can't figure out why the unbilled short film \\"God of Love\\" is here, other than no one could figure what other DVD to stick this thing on...but the good news is you can just skip it.

B0044430H8|5.0|The highest compliment I can give this soundtrack is that Reznor and Ross clearly put a lot of thought and effort into this score without making it sound overproduced or clunky. It has depth and is enjoyable for several listens. There are passages that will stick with you, but it is not annoyingly repetitive.
B004DK49DW|5.0|The album of the year. No more, no less!  SD's music has grown mature and the arrangements and production make this album their best by far.  I'll be in Paris early July to see them live, for sure!
B004POVBRS|5.0|I purchased and watched all of season one and season two because I came across this show after season three had  already started. I was so amazed and couldn't get enough of fringe. I think this is science fiction at it's very best and it is one of the best shows on all the major stations. I hope and pray it doesn't get cancelled. I think that would be a big mistake for Fox.

B0042JTDXK|5.0|I am always on the prowl for more Josh Groban or Sarah Brightman recordings. My wife likes how I get the new CD & she can play it before most others even know it is available. She now plays it almost daily. She has EVERY CD that Josh has cut, mostly purchased through Amazon.com. I like how I can find MUSIC & BOOKS easily & read reviews on the older ones.     She says this CD is all new music & she likes it. She just heard on TV that Josh is going on TOUR again. We will hope we are on his TOUR ROUTE?

B003HFWRMO|2.0|In this book, Robert T. Kiyosaki and Sharon L. Lechter encourage tax evasion via vehicle of corporation (spend all your pre-tax corporate money any way you see fit and then  let the government tax you on the remaining pennies), corporate malfeasance by the old radical conservative attitude of \\"eat the poor because they will waste their money if you pay them above poverty level\\", disregard for labor laws. The author praises his \\"rich dad\\" who not only takes advantage of everyone he hires, including the woman he calls \\"like a mother to him\\", paying them all below minimum wage or nothing at all, as well as firing any employee who'd notify the authorities of this criminal mistreatment.<br /><br />Sure, rich dad talks a good talk about making sure to be legally getting rich, but his actions speak louder than words, as he gleefully and ruthlessly takes advantage of children paying them next to nothing, oblivious or irreverent to and of existing child labor laws. He is consistently rude toward anyone who's not rich, and calls the author's own birth father \\"a lazy thief\\", since Kyiosaki's dead works for the government. The author is fine with all of that, rejecting his real father simply because he struggled financially and was never rich, though his father was always there for him in whatever way he could, tried to teach him honesty and diligence in work, all these values conservatives want us to learn but seldom practice themselves.<br /><br />The book is so radically conservative it makes Sean Shammity look like James Stewart by comparison. The subtitle of the book is \\"What the Rich Teach Their Kids About Money-That the Poor and the Middle Class Do Not!\\" and for a good reason. The middle class and the poor simply would not want their children to grow up selfish, law-breaking and greedy narcissists Kiyosaki's \\"rich dad\\" wanted him to be, plain and simple. The overall message of the book is: get rich or you're nothing, get rich so that you can get away with anything in this country, as the rich often do and then get rewarded for their immorality with Republican-pushed, undeserved, tax cuts. It screams of wanton desire to make everyone else your slave.<br /><br />Is it all bad? No. The author's economic and accounting lessons are actually very helpful to an extent that we all learn to tell a liability from an asset (thus the 2 stars). However, that I could have easily learned from accounting or economics books. If you are a radical conservative you'll love this book. But if you have any concern and compassion for your fellow, you'll read it and donate it at your local Salvation Army, which is exactly what I am going to do with it.

B002MQYOFW|5.0|I was conflicted about reading this series when I first heard about it; it sounded violent and horrific.  The concept truly is, but the book was so good, I read it in one sitting.  Not for the squeamish, but it could be used to fuel classroom discussion (or family) about society today, what could make a society devolve to this point, and numerous issues of humanity and what it means.

0679805273|5.0|This book has a grown-up message in the form of a story that kids will love!  My daughter received this book as a gift when she graduated from Kindergarten.  Although the message was bigger than what she could really grasp at the time, the story is filled with emotion that kept her interested with each turn of the page.  From the excitement of seeing new sights to the slumps of reality to escaping the Waiting Place to being alone and then hiking on to success!  In a children's story, Dr. Seuss challenges readers in any walk of life to push on through the hard times because we all have the potential to move mountains.

B001OQCV2E|2.0|As a person who loves disaster flicks I was so looking forward to seeing this latest entry from director Roland Emmerich (especially since I already have most of his films in my collection).  I'm sorry to say I didn't add this one to it.<br /><br />I don't know that anything could have saved this glorious mess of mayhem.  Recasting?  A better script?  Cut the length?  Judicious editing?  I knew I was in for a bumpy ride right from the start, all those nonsensical snippets, itty bitty scenes that didn't add up to anything.  It took a half hour before someone bothered mentioning that \\"the earth's crust was destabilizing.\\"  Even then, what exactly did that mean and why was there no sense of heightened urgency about it?  (This is what put the ho-hum in hokum.)  They kept flashing the years gone by before anything was actually done about it, it being the science mumbo jumbo barely mentioned at the start.  Wow.  This was one cold, aloof, action film; when it wasn't straying into outlandish comedy courtesy of Woody Harrelson & John Cusack.  Half of the cast was taking everything deadly serious, the other half either looked lost or were going off on their own, it didn't matter what this picture was about because it soon felt like a free-for-all.  Not because it stopped making sense but because it never really started.  Example: if the whole idea was to preserve humanity and what animals you could, would you start with saving all the old folks beyond procreation and leave the young behind?  Worse.  They had years to come up with this plan and that's the best they could do?  After about the second hour I was beginning to think a better plan would be just to let everything go to ruin and call it a day.<br />I don't even want to talk about Oliver Platt (normally one of my favorite actors).  Or the lounge act that sings \\"It Ain't The End Of The World.\\"  I'm still trying to decide if that was meant to be ironic or inadvertently stupid.<br /><br />Insert a heavy, disappointed sigh...all those fantastic special effects in search of a better movie.  What a waste.ic special effects in search of a better movie.  What a waste.
B0041G683W|5.0|Great purchase! Lea Salonga's \\"I Dreamed a Dream\\" was stirring and brlliant.  Her voice has matured from when she played Eponine.  Is it possible for her to be my favorite Eponine AND Fantine of all time???  The Jean Valjean quartet singing \\"Bring Him Home\\" during the encore was EPIC!!!  Alfie Boe certainly has a new fan in me. (The \\"high octave surprise\\" hits you like nothing you have ever experienced before)  Colm Wilkinson will always be Valjean in my mind and in this encore performance, he brings every emotion to the song.  The man could almost sing with his face alone - he is that good!  In spite of Nick Jonas and what I feel was a miscast for him to play Marius (which is so blatantly pointed out when Michael Ball delivers his first note during the incredible encore), I will maintain my 5 star rating. The blu-ray picture and sound quality were incredible!!  As a huge fan of the original cast recording and the 10th anniversary concert, I highly recommend opening your hearts to this fresh and captivating take on what is probably the greatest musical of our time.

1594202842|3.0|I enjoyed the straight talk for what it was worth.  Americans surely benefit from direct challenges, and even somewhat specious ideas can be entertaining or provoke thought.  My rating reflects a balance of my enjoyment of the narrative versus her transparent illogic that made me slightly ill.    Let me get this straight:    \\"Tiger Mother\\" married a Western man from a permissive, left-leaning but hyper-ambitious Western family, who formerly believed in an anachronistic Western religion, and agreed to raise her kids as members of that religion, even though the husband is not \\"remotely religious?\\"  That's an interesting start.    \\"Tiger Mother\\" aspired to have her children become experts on Western musical instruments in scores written by Western geniuses to perform in front of Western audiences in musical halls made possible by Western entrepreneurs (Carnegie) and attend Western institutions of higher learning.      \\"Tiger Mother\\" relatives came West and stayed West where she has spent her entire life.    So the inferior Western system created Mozart, Beethoven, pianos, violins, Michelangelo, DaVinci, Carnegie, Rockefeller, Jefferson, Madison, Lincoln, antisepsis, surgery, steel, engines, airplanes, lightbulbs, electrical transmission, automated locomotion of all sorts, the typewriter, eyeglasses, rubber, modern chemistry, biology and physics, in short, virtually every meaningful invention imaginable...to this day, all of it from the West, including all the cutting-edge new scientists...all advancement from life being nasty, brutish and short to widespread wealth and freedom, all from the West, virtually none of any of it from China...I challege you to name a small handful of meaningful inventions, art or advancements to come out of China, versus the self-evidently countless millions out of the West...but Chinese parenting is superior?    Interesting.    I feel three stars is extremely generous.  Go back and rewrite conclusions.  Immediately.

0312370849|2.0|Just finished reading this book for a book club tonight. I was really into it for the first half, and I didn't mind the way the short chapters jumped back and forth from the past to the present. I found the chapters from the past, with Sarah's story, to be interesting, with not a lot but enough suspense. However the book was dreadfully predictable and so unbelievable. As others have mentioned, the characters were flat and cliche'. I just did not believe that a woman who seemed otherwise happy with her life would have her life turned so upside down by this assignment for work, and how predictable and convenient that the apartment she was about to move into was the same apartment Sarah had been taken from (gee, didn't see that coming *sarcasm*). After Sarah's story abruptly ended, it was all down hill from there. I did not care about or believe Julia. I found her completely self absorbed and SELFISH! I did not believe she would truly become so invested in finding out about this woman (we are never led to believe that she is privy to all the details of the same story we are). I did not believe the father-in-law Edourd would become so affected by the story only after Julia makes it her life's mission to find out about Sarah. And she didn't care in the least about opening up a sad past for people who either had moved beyond it or didn't know about it, it was all about her and her desire to find out more. I predicted nearly every step of the story, and literally rolled my eyes when the baby's name was finally revealed (duh). The back and forth with William - he won't talk to her, then he does, then he disappears again, then comes back, then (once again) will he talk to her? snore! And they both just happened to have had divorces and move to NY? I also agree with the others, the writing was juvenile, almost insulting in places. The book had a lot of potential but fell very flat. Kind of wishing I had spent my time reading something else.

0312370849|2.0|This book is about an interesting and important subject, the holocaust and the response to it by the non-Jewish civilian population in France.  It starts in an interesting manner, with the narration switching back and forth between a contemporary woman, researching the holocaust in France for an English language journal, and a girl of French nationality and Jewish ethnicity during wartime Paris.  This narrative form is a little difficult to adjust to but also interesting. The little girl, being taken away by the police during a roundup of Jews in Paris helps her younger brother hide in their apartment to avoid being taken away. What becomes of him when she cannot return for him is the mystery of the first half of the book. However, at about the middle of the book, we find out his fate. At this point the author abandons the dual narrative device, and we are left wondering the fate of the sister. The solution to this mystery is the plot driver of the second and far less satisfying half of the book.  The writing seems to deteriorate into a \\"how do I tie up all the lose ends in this plot I have created?\\" plot-driven melodrama.  There is no further character development and the whole thing lurches on in what might as well be a TV or movie plot. Very unsatisfying and ultimately shallow.
B0014QNGA0|5.0|I enjoyed all of the selections on this CD.  It was strange, however, to hear Juan Diego sing the \\"La Fille\\" \\"Ah mes amis\\" in Italian.  I prefer the French version because the phrasing is better suited to the notes.  Nonetheless, the singing is, indeed, spectacular.
0739380338|5.0|I was scepticle about this series after seeing the movie Percy Jackson Lightning Thief. Don't get me wrong, the movie was good but it didn't really impress me as great.     My daughters told me to try the books because they were so much better. I got the audiobooks because I drive a lot in the Atlanta, GA area (more like sit in traffic a lot).     I agree with their assessment that the books are great!! Almost makes me want to go back to my early teens and relive the adventure of growing up (without the monsters of course).
B00006OA8C|5.0|I got this album super quick on standard shipping from GoHastings. Thanks man! Ordered it on Tuesday, got it today (Thursday). Now for the record. Marvin Gaye was a genius at composing music! The Funk Brothers, a group of jazz musicians who did all the recordings for the Detroit era of Motown (1959-1972), were even bigger geniuses!! This is one of those classic albums that everyone should have in their music collection! Every single song has a sick groove and a flow that can't be matched. From \\"What's Going On\\" to \\"Mercy Mercy Me (The Ecology)\\" on side A to \\"Right On\\" to \\"Inner City Blues (Make Me Wanna Holler)\\" on side B, the whole album is phenomenal and runs smoothly from one song until the next. This album is for Marvin Gaye what \\"Abbey Road\\" was for The Beatles. Just one flawless masterpiece! There is a funny story to the music. If you've seen the documentary; \\"Standing In The Shadows Of Motown\\", you'll know this about the album's recording sessions. If you haven't, find it on Amazon and buy it. It's a great little documentary. Anyway, Funk Brother bassist, James Jamerson, originally didn't want to do the recording but did so out of respect for Marvin Gaye. Marvin found James at a club James was playing at. James was pretty drunk when Marvin found him. James was so drunk that he couldn't even sit down let alone stand up. So they gave James his bass and he lied down on the floor and played the opening track for \\"What's Going On\\". Most people can't play the bass line for the song and James Jamerson did it lying down on the floor, stroking the strings only with his right index finger! If that doesn't make you want this record for the awesomeness that was James Jamerson, I don't know what will! Trust me, you want this record in your collection! Future generations need to listen to the classics of artists like Marvin Gaye, real music is a dying art it seems today.
073936474X|5.0|I was scepticle about this series after seeing the movie Percy Jackson Lightning Thief. Don't get me wrong, the movie was good but it didn't really impress me as great.     My daughters told me to try the books because they were so much better. I got the audiobooks because I drive a lot in the Atlanta, GA area (more like sit in traffic a lot).     I agree with their assessment that the books are great!! Almost makes me want to go back to my early teens and relive the adventure of growing up (without the monsters of course).
0230710077|5.0|Loved it. The history is so good, then he adds the personal life stories and makes it even better. Seriously, when is the next one due out??
B004EBT5CU|3.0|I loved Adele's first album, but very disappointed in the new one. Some songs are just hard on the ears, as wonderful as she sings. I usually wait to buy until I can listen to samples, but there were none on a preorder, and figuring this album would be as great. Not so for me... Yet her concert is sold out in Seattle in a day???
B00475AYJQ|5.0|A few pages of \\"the name of the wind\\" makes clear that it was no ordinary novel.<br /><br />The writing clear.<br />The choosing of words mastery.<br /><br />The story and characters suggestive of wisdom earned painfully and seldom shared, innocence to make old remember their youth, and more fun and memories than anyone can refuse.<br /><br />And yet, like a shared secret, knowledge of the novel was shared primarily by word of mouth and twitter updates and amazon reviews.  A long book deserving to be reread - and many of us have, twice, thrice....more would lessen the experience.<br /><br />And, now, at the start of the work week, one or two years after most of us have read the first novel, a publisher releases a ~1000 page sequel.<br /><br />I'm waiting to find out that the stock market has tanked as everyone has called in sick and that there is a silence punctuated by nothing more than the quick moving of pages across our great land.  Not true?<br /><br />Well, then, perhaps it will simply take year or decades before the trilogy earns its place and name as a modern classic of fantasy literature - a deep and penetrating statement on the nature of being young and the value of wisdom, and the paradox that gaining one reduces the other.<br /><br />And, yet, how much we so wish we could keep both.
B001TH8UUA|1.0|I bought two of these cables back in August. At first, they worked great. However, one of the cables broke in November, and now the second one I purchases is starting to flicker and show signs of breaking as well. They are inexpensive, but now I have to go and buy new ones again. Definitely not worth the price.
0060930349|5.0|I originally bought this book on Kindle.  After reading it about one quarter of the way through, I found that I really want it for reference material. I love my Kindle, but find it just a bit cumbersome for my use as a reference tool, so I purchased History of the American People in hard copy.  Now I can pick it up anytime and using the index I can easily find what I want to review.  I refer friends and family to this book quite often.  I love it!  The material is presented in a straightforward manor and I find it to be accurate.  I highly recommend this great book.
B0006GAOCW|5.0|Great acting from the well selected cast. Who wouldn't want to see this love story.
B0041KKYBA|5.0|While the framers of the American Constitution knew they were creating a Republic for the rich (voting was linked to property ownership),  they'd all roll over in their graves if they saw this extraordinary indictment of who we are today.   \\"Inside Job\\" is a portrait of a criminal state in the state of luxuriant, stinking decomposition.   If this film is to be believed (and so far I've seen no evidence to suggest it should not), then Ancient Rome had nothing on us.    Every American should see this now.     And every American should ask their elected officials when the indictments will start rolling in.    Otherwise, we are in desperate need of those true patriots-- the kids in Egypt who overturned Mubarak-- to teach us once again the meaning of liberty.    What else to do?   I told Harvard I wouldn't give them any more money until they got rid of Larry (the scam) Summers.    Columbia University should probably just bury itself somewhere under Central Park if they don't find a way to give Glenn Hubbard what he deserves.    Nice little Glenn:  hope he's enjoying his millions.  The idea that a man like that should be allowed anywhere near students gives me the creeps.    Why not just bring back Sam Giancana and Al Capone and let them teach business school?    And if congress (or Obama) won't get out of bed with the filth,  why not just replace our elected officials with the call girls the bankers gave so much of our money to?  The girls seem a lot more honest (and even at $3,000 an hour, reasonably priced) than Hubbard, Summers, Mishkin, et al.  After all-- those guys cost America its future, and its soul.    Of course the rot began long before the story here-- even before Ronald Reagan, the \\"man who sold the world (as William Kleinknecht put it in his brilliant analysis of the great lie of the \\"great communicator,\\"  America's real Wizard of Oz).   But Reagan is the ultimate villain here-- and properly deserves the role he will play when history is written:  the man who destroyed America.
B0013527I4|5.0|Although it arrived in a timely fashion this product couldn't get to me fast enough. I was so excited when I saw it available! I grew up with The Muppets, so this was nostalgic perfection! Fozzie Bear, Beaker, and the Hecklers still make me laugh hard enough to produce tears. For those familiar with the muppets : it's a wonderful trip down memory lane. For those who aren't familiar: it's timeless and endearing enough for you to enjoy. Good, clean fun for ALL ages!
B003N5VOUO|5.0|This is the second Indian movie I seen (Slum Millionaire was the 1st one) and I must say is the best drama movie I seen so far, to describe it best this movie is a combination of \\"Rain Man with Forrest Gump\\". Highly Recomended
B0011UBDTK|5.0|This is a phenomenal series to own. I was a bit nervous to order an entire collectors series instead of the individual seasons. It was one of the best purchases I have made: prompt delivery, sturdy packaging, used product was in tip-top shape, and there is nothing edited or omitted from the originally aired episodes. The DVD's are held in sturdy pockets, complete with individual episode sumaries, and pictures of the cast. It's essentially a chic, pink velvet, 3-ring binder of fabulousness!
B000000OF6|5.0|If you like Queen you will absolutely enjoy this CD collection.  Queen is just fantastic even after  all these years.  Very satisfied with this purchase.  Highly recommend for those that enjoy talented groups of the past that still 'rock' even today.  Talent never ages and this CD is a classic example of one of the best!
B00428CPUY|2.0|As much as I love Clapton's music I have to say the best Crossroads was the Dallas one. I have DVD's of Dallas, the 2007 and 2010 Crossroads events and this one is the most disappointing one. I've never been so sick of seeing Bill Murray trying to be funny. After the 2007 Festival I would have thought they would have ditched him trying to MC the event, he was so poor. And Cheryl Crow? Gimme a break! Someone needs to rethink this and go back to Texas with the original format. Clapton, Beck, and ZZ Top rock but after that.....
0618918248|2.0|For us who were brought up in atheist or agnostic milieus and have since pursued careers in the sciences, Richard Dawkins has done the favor of binding all of our cherished conceits conveniently between the covers of a single volume.  Here we will be reassured that we are of like mind with the 93% of elite and enlightened members of the National Academy of Science who do not believe in a personal god.  It will be averred that our favorite arguments against the existence of such a god remain unassailable.  We will be reminded that the traditional arguments in favor of religion are not only philosophically unsound, they are unscientific.  At the end of this book the sense of self-satisfaction is complete.<br /><br />But this was not the author's objective.  \\"If this book works as I intend,\\" he says, \\"religious readers who open it will be atheists when they put it down.\\"  One anticipates, then, breaking the horse gently, gradually tempering him to bridle and bit.  But just a few pages later Dawkins comments on \\"the weakness of the religious mind,\\" a characterization that seems poorly calculated to win such a mind to his point of view.  A short distance further on he refers to the Hebrew god as \\"the Old Testament's psychotic delinquent.\\"  This is among the gentler salutations found throughout the book.  In fact as you read this thing it's hard to overcome the impression that rather than persuade the religious, he seeks instead to bludgeon them.<br /><br />One of the author's gripes about religion, aside from its failure to conform to rationalism, is \\"society's exaggerated respect\\" for it.  Dawkins' exemplar of this is the 2006 case of the Danish cartoons of Muhammad.  He recounts the apparent conspiracy to whip up resentment among Muslims worldwide and the resulting riots and abuse, including murder, of Christians and Westerners.  \\"In response to all this frenzied pandemonium,\\" comments Dawkins, \\"decent liberal newspapers deplored the violence and made token noises about free speech.  But at the same time they expressed `respect' and `sympathy' for the deep `offence' and `hurt' that Muslims had `suffered'.\\"  Dawkins then wonders at the \\"disproportionate privileging of religion.\\"  \\"What is so special about religion,\\" he asks, \\"that we grant it such uniquely privileged respect?\\"<br /><br />This is not hard to figure out.  It was not a case of the \\"privileging of religion\\" generally but of Islam in particular.  And the responses of newspapers were not out of societal regard for religious faith, Islamic or otherwise, but rather concern over provoking further violence among Muslims and putting more people at risk.  These were editorial decisions, and it can be debated whether or not they were prudent, but they are not evidence of privilege.<br /><br />The absence of special privilege for religion is particularly true in America.  Dawkins is British, and things might be quite different in Britain, but here in America we have the First Amendment, pursuant to which we say and print things critical of religious faith, religious institutions, and religious people all the time, e.g., Dawkins' book.  It is such a commonplace, in fact, that it hardly merits notice.  We have even gone so far as to have displayed works of \\"art\\" such as Andres Serrano's \\"Piss Christ,\\" a photograph of corpus and crucifix submerged in the shutterbug's own urine.  Despite the potential religious offensiveness of this image, it was not suppressed.  In fact it was supported partially at public expense, and the debut was widely reported in the press.  (Artistic acclaim was glowing, religious acclaim less so, but still Christians somehow refrained from worldwide riot.)<br /><br />The difference between public attitudes toward religion in America and Britain is the subject of a particular puzzle for Dawkins.  \\"[T]he United States, founded in secularism, is now the most religiose country in Christendom, while England, with an established church ... is among the least.  Iam continually asked why this is, and I do not know.\\"<br /><br />This is not hard to figure out either.  While the front-line Anglican clergyman of Britain has become (Dawkins quoting one Giles Fraser, vicar) a \\"tea-drinking, gentle eccentric\\" who \\"represented a type of religion that didn't make non-religious people feel uncomfortable,\\" there remain in America clergy from numerous sects who sincerely and energetically believe.  If Britain's establishment clergy demonstrate they lack commitment, you can hardly expect more from the laity.  In contrast, many American clergy are eager to sweep up the leavings of unserious churches and make of them believers.  And despite the scientific advances of our time, a fervent promise of salvation or call to moral purpose, however fantastical, will persuade far more people than will an appeal to morally indifferent science.  Benighted these converts might be, but if Prof. Dawkins seeks to persuade them, he might wish to take into account some results from the science of psychology.<br /><br />But he would rather demonstrate the obtuseness of religion by recounting the long history of religious corruption, the foolishness of belief, and the power of rational counter-argument.  All of us who have tried this know how easy it is and how pleasing to press a foot on the neck of an intellectual inferior.  All of us who have tried it also know how easy it is for this tactic to give offense.  Which may account for some of the \\"hatred and misunderstanding of atheists\\" that Dawkins cites, documentation of which is kept in a database maintained by the Freethought Society of Greater Philadelphia.  One shouldn't hate atheists, of course.  Disagree with them, sure; debate them if you have time and inclination.  Likewise one shouldn't hate theists, and perhaps Dawkins doesn't, but as is evident in this book, he certainly holds their views in solid and public contempt.  It does nothing to lessen any supposed hatred and misunderstanding of atheists that their most prominent spokesman makes himself obnoxious.am continually asked why this is, and I do not know.\\"<br /><br />This is not hard to figure out either.

B000VR824S|3.0|For me, as much as I liked Bill Murray in SNL and his movies, I was feeling like this was his event instead of Clapton's. Murray was more of a waste of film footage as he introduced guests and met them back stage. The act that blew me away was the bass guitar player for Jeff Beck. Tal was amazing! My advice to Clapton and the producers is to take it back to Dallas without Murray and recapture that magic. Dump Bill Murray and this would have been rated rated higher by me.

B0032JTV6U|5.0|My son who just turned 13 loves Glee and has watched every episode from the 1st season so he's finally caught up!  We only started wacthing it about the 3rd episode of the 2nd season.  The music is not really to my taste, but for a 7th grader watching high schoolers, I guess it seems really cool to him.  What makes him happy, makes me happy.
0061245097|5.0|After serious issues with the ending in the first book, I am happy to say that the author has redeemed herself with this book.  I was not happy with the way Cat left in the final chapters of the book before this one, and I was hesitant on reading the rest of the series because of it.  I didn't want to get my hopes up again in this book and then the author pull the rug out from under me at the end.  Good thing she didn't or I might have screamed!<br /><br />In this book, we flash forward four years into the future.  Cat has been working for Don at the FBI group that is not well known. She is basically doing the same thing she did with Bones, but she is now working with humans as her back up.  When Bones shows back up in her life, everything starts to go crazy in Cat's life.  She is hurt, elated, scared and angry all at the same time.  The feelings are the same with Bones who feels that Cat deserted him instead of trusting him.<br /><br />With kick ass fight scenes, witty writing and additional shockers to add to the story, this book surpassed my excitement from the last book.  The characters have grown and in turn have made relationships more concrete and lasting.  Friendships are developed, family is exposed and love scenes that will keep you flushed and hot all night long! (Go Chapter 32! RAWR!)<br /><br />After reading One Foot in the Grave, it is safe to say I am officially hooked on this series.  I am intrigued and in love with the characters that captured my interest from book one and in this one!  I still have my favorites, and I still have my least appealing characters, but overall I am sucked into the world of fantasy and romance that this author writes so well!
B004EBT5CU|5.0|I love this album. it is the first CD I have bought in probably 2 years and I enjoy it more each time I listen to it.
B000JQU1VS|5.0|Like some Kindle owners, I downloaded this book because it was free. Why not? I just got around to reading it and it's fantastic. Doyle's writing is old style, but oddly enough it's refreshing. It will challenge your knowledge of the English vocabulary. It doesn't hinder the ease of the read but makes you think how words can be used that you just don't see today. Watson's narrative adds to the flavor of the story. My only regret is that I waited so long to read these stories.     This kindle version has some errors when it was digitized, especially when the British Pound money is referenced. There is no index to pick a story. Some words that Doyle uses cannot be found by the Kindle dictionary for a meaning, strange but true in this version. If these minor flaws do not bother you, then this free version will suit you. If you prefer these conveniences, a $2.00 Kindle issue is still a very small price for a very enjoyable read.
B0034G4P7Q|5.0|If you are an entrepreneur you will be inspired by the work ethic and dedication of Zuckerberg.  Although, a lot of the scenarios have been sensationalized, the overall message is real; that is, work hard, make tough decisions and never look back.
B003LDKUSK|4.0|This is one of those classic children's books that stand the test of time. Good story, sweet and wholesome with good illustrations. This book is on the longer side, but we have not had a problem keeping interest in it. While the illustrations are lovely the illustrations are a bit muted with all of the color in books on the market today. And, as such I have noticed our DD doesn't ask as many questions about the pictures as she does with other books. But it is still a great story.
0312330537|5.0|This book was so well crafted, so completely realized, that I still find myself wondering what happened to some of the characters in it, like I do with Stephen King's \\"The Stand.\\" The only difference is, these characters are real. I haven't read a book this good in at least 15 years, and I've read thousands of them. Having traveled to Bombay (now called Mumbai), I can picture all the places the author talks about in this story, but I never imagined such insanity could take place. The author's firsthand accounts of his rise through all levels of the Indian mafia are incredible, especially considering he's not Indian. Every scene, whether it takes place in the dirtiest of slums or the wealthiest of mafia houses, is so well written that I feel an immediate, visceral connection. The main character (the author himself) comes off like a combination of Jason Bourne, Jack Reacher and Robin Hood. The action is intense. There are scenes of pain and torture in one of India's worst prisons; of altruism and goodwill in one of India's biggest slums; of fear and politics in the skirmishes between India, Pakistan and Afghanistan; and of love, friendship and loss. All are connected by one thread: redemption. The author's tale is woven around his friendships, whether with a cab driver, an assassin, or a mafia don; and how all these friendships shaped his life in India.  If you like books that are extremely well written, full of action and adventure, and have a decent amount of sex and violence as well, this book is for you. I simply cannot imagine that one man had so much happen to him, or that one man made so much happen to (and for) others.

0545265355|5.0|This is by far the best book series I have read in a while!  The very beginning of the first book was a little slow and I started to worry that the whole thing was going to be that way but then it took off like a shot and I was completely addicted!!!

B0034G4OUY|4.0|Take with a grain of salt. I had no interest when this came out in theaters but it was a buck at redbox, so why not I asked myself. Not being that big of a fan of Dwayne \\"The Rock\\" Johnson already, it is quite difficult to see him in films and find him enjoyable. After selling his soul to Disney movies it seems he's is back to action. Though being no special actor, a revenge film is a much better choice for him in my opinion, who does not like vengeanance? The Rock reminds of Stallone in the newest Rambo. The only reason I could fathom the movie was because Rambo did not talk much throughout the movie, just brutally killed everyone. Ha, now this film is better because the Rock doesn't talk much if you catch what I'm saying. I would not look for \\"stand-out\\" acting performances besides Carla Gugino in the film, the others are nothing special. I found her enjoyable and attractive. There are no actual names given to characters in the film either which was interesting. There is literally DRIVER, COP, and THE KILLER. You could have called the movie that and gotten away from it. \\"The Driver, The Cop...The Killer\\". The title comes from the killer's wife asking if the driver (the rock) was as fast as him...A simple reply of \\"Faster\\" is then said. The action in the film is quite good though. The film itself does not really having many dull moments at all throughout it. There are quite a few head shots that look very realistic without the new CGI blood that everyone uses nowadays, which was nice to see. There is a semi-understandable, yet very unbelievable story about getting revenge on the people who killed his brother, but its a movie so take it with a grain of salt like I said earlier. I'd rent too, before purchasing. This one might not be for everyone, but for me (someone who did not expect much at all) I enjoyed it surprisingly and did not fast forward. I hope I've been helpful..<br /><br />-Cam
0143034901|5.0|I bought this book just by a chance at an airport on my way back to home..just to spend my flight reading something. At the first pages, I knew I had done very good to buy it..It was a book with several layers waits to be discovered..It was a delight that the taste of which will never be forgotten..
B0009HKH6Q|3.0|The dvd audio and video are excellent.  This is a memorable film , not a great one.  This is a film of my youth , as such it is part of my anti aging therapy.  Possibly Mc Queen's coolest performance.  I watched it several times as soon as I received it,and will continue to watch it,  it is worth watching.
B004MMEIK0|4.0|I really enjoyed this book. It has a good story and had some great dialog which had me laughing more than once. Yes, it's another vampire romance but one of the better ones.  I'm disappointed that the subsequent books in the series are so expensive for Kindle.  To the publisher: drop your price in half and I'll buy all of them.  At the current price, I won't buy any more. :(
1423389409|5.0|In my limited experience with Fantasy books, I have come accross many great books with amazing world building, fantastic and awe inspiring magic, character development.. They always made me hungry to learn more about the world, magic or the characters.. Until I read Name of the Wind, I thought I would always want more details and explanations in a book before I could properly appreciate it. But, Name of the Wind and Wise Man's Fear made me realize that With an awesome flow of words, stories with in a story how a story should be told the proper way, so that we can just simply listen to it and be in awe of it and understand everything by instinct rather than by reason or lengthy explanation by the author.. Thanks much for the magical weaving of words that always leave me breathless with anticipation, Pat.. We all owe you one.. :)
B00005ND42|3.0|I love the violin performance on this recording, but the overall sound quality of the recording causes me to wish for a more modern recording. First, the background hiss (artifact of the 1962 analog recording technology?) is quite annoying during the gentle, quiet passages. I can't stop hearing it, as much as I'd like to focus on the performance.  Second, the piano voice seems muffled compared to the amazingly vibrant texture of the violin.  I do like ruggedly textured recordings (such as those by the Giardino Armonico) and Oistrakh's violin quality here fits that bill nicely.  Sadly, the recording engineers did not capture Oborin's piano nearly so faithfully, unless they closed the piano's case so as not to overshadow the violin.  Perhaps the felts on the piano were intentionally tuned to create a duller tone than my ear prefers.     In any case, this is definitely an ADD recording, not a modern DDD recording, and sadly a hiss is audible in the subtle passages.
B0012Q732O|1.0|The movie 10,000 B.C is one of those movies that you should listen to the critics about. On Yahoo it has a C- rating by Top Critics. I was like who cares,the critics are always wrong, right. Well, I should have listened to them for sure. It did have action, but Roland Emmerich messed up on this one. First of all the Earth has not been around for 10,000 years. Second off, the movie was poorly made and really annoying at times. Don't see one of the worst movies that has a huge budget and has nothing good to talk about.<br />Story:F<br />Acting:F<br />Action:D<br />Direction:F<br />Visual effects:D+<br />Rating:D
0670022411|4.0|I enjoyed A Discovery of Witches.  I bought the audio version because I never have time to read.  It was a little slow to start, but the main character, Diana Bishop, is very likable.  She is smart, strong and moves through the story with purpose.  I didn't feel as if the characters were making choices that seemed so contrived it seemed stupid - like other books in this genre.  (Sorry, I hated Twilight).  This book is slow paced, not action packed - although there are some very turbulent scenes.  It's not a \\"sit on the edge of your seat\\" story.  It's a leisurely paced story about self discovery, love and breaking down social discriminations.      I will not give any plot details because other reviews have done a better job than I could.  But I will say that the end of the story definitely suggests a 2nd book to follow.  It's the second book I really want to read!  The potential of the next story is more interesting to me and if she writes it, I will defiantly read it.       That is how I judge whether I think a book is good or bad.  Did this book blow my mind?  No.  But it did make me care about the characters.  I want to see them succeed and I want to spend more time with them and find out how it all turns out.  If a book can make me want to do that - it's pretty good.

B003R0LBVW|1.0|I seriously don't know what the hype is about for this book.  The writing was dreadfully slow and the plot was a pathetic woe-is-me house wife story.  i walked away from this book furious at the time and energy I put into finishing this book.  Take my advice & dont waste your time.
B002RWKSII|4.0|My 2 favorites groups while growing up in the 1960's were the Beatles and the Beachboys. (I along with a few million others probably!)...Now, after all these years, The Beachboys are still fun, but still mainly for their adolescent audience..The Beatles> well , the timelessness of the their best 50 or so songs, may place them in breathing distance of Gershwin, Porter, Mercer, Etc...Though Brian makes a valiant and fine effort here, most of these renditions just do not fly, though they do sound OK as fairly rusty versions of old Gershwin tunes. His voice is OK, but burnt out, though the choirboy backgrounds do strike a note of old Beachboy fun! The choirboy a cappelos sandwiching the album are excellent, and top out the rest; plus the neo-Gershwin/ Wilson update of \\"Like in the Love\\" is a real and excellent neo-BeachBoy sound...As for the rest, though listenable, and well above most aging rockers efforts to re-do old standards, they just don't compare with best, and \\"I Got Rhythm\\" is a bit embarrassing, somewhat like the 1960's 4 Seasons version..\\"Can't Take that away\\" is cute, but really an adolescent version. The rest perhaps a B-...But for introducing these songs to the post-50 set, many still in the \\"Stones\\" \\"Hendrix\\"and \\"Zeppelin \\"  mode, Brian offers a fine service, and as noted, a most valiant attempt. Check Peggy Lee's \\"Can't Take that Away..\\" or Ella Fitzgerald's monumental and magnificant  Gershwin Collection with Nelson Riddle (from the late 1950's), for the difference between Brian's semi-du-op versions and the real thing for grown-ups....Also, Brian's tribute to his late brothers Carl and Dennis in the linear notes was heartrending for this old/ geezerish Beach Boy fan!
1439107955|5.0|This is an exceptional, chronological and highly focused book which is highly readable.  Unfortunately the world of cancer research, while populated by amazing individuals, is so fraught with egos and politics that much of the good work, I fear, will not easily filter down to help so many of us.    I am very struck by the fact that many advances have been made (and failures not discontinued when they are identified) and we never hear of them in the media.   One can only guess that there are many agendas occurring in addition to the egos and politics.  I am hoping that our author does not give up on his following this pursuit and continues to care that advances are available.    Those reviewers who wrote that this was a real page-turner are right - I have not put this down since I got it.    Keep on Dr Mukherjee - I am glad we have professionals like you.  I recognize the personal toll that this work takes and am extremely grateful to those laboring in this field.
B001GOVW4M|3.0|I found this one and the rest of the set not so user friendly at first but after getting into it and getting to understand how it is set up, you can find what you are looking for but still some things needed more explanation because of ambiguity in the English language.
B0013D8LCW|5.0|This film is so beautiful & heart warming that having hired it from the library I had to buy it (from US Amazon as there isn't one in Australia!). It will always be a favourite film of mine, not just because I can relate strongly to it personally, but because the theme of love conquering all is timeless & close to my heart. Intelligently written & acted, and beautiful cinematography, challenging society to overcome it's homophobia/general bigotry, but it has humor too... Enjoy!
B004B63M1S|1.0|...that paints anybody in favor of border security, and against illegal immigration, as blood-thirsty psychopaths.  This movie is ludicrous even by cartoon standards, and it just gets more ridiculous as it goes along.  If you can get past the anti-American agenda, though, you might just enjoy this trashy exploitation picture for what it is: an obviously tongue in cheek fantasy, that has absolutely no basis in political or social reality, or in logic.  Me? I hated it.

B003Q6D25K|2.0|I am one on those who hate the hand held camera gimmick as much as the staged \\"reality\\" TV. The first film I literally gave away to a complete stranger. In this film we discover why the demon comes to the house-maybe. There is no shocking final scene as far as I can tell. The goofy stuff starts shortly after Hunter is born. The house is ransacked, except for his room. So the family installs cameras in all the rooms, as well as walk around with a hand held camera all the time, plus a few camera shots that didn't fill either description, such as the OUIJA board scene.<br /><br />The house keeper suspects an evil spirit is in the house. The daughter thinks it is a demon from mom's side of the family after Hunter, and mom thinks it has something to do with the fact her and her sister cleavage used to hold seances. Dad is a skeptic and doesn't believe much of anything and the dog just barks. This is dad's second wife who seems only slightly older than his bikini daughter.<br /><br />The plot behind the movie isn't have bad but instead of having a sound track, a decent camera crew, and a token shower scene, we end up with another hand held yawner that bored me to tears as I spent half the time watching a pool crawler. OH LOOK! It got out of the pool! I suggest you read the reviews and fast forward to day 12 or so, to avoid rigor mortis.<br /><br />No sex, no nudity, a few F-bombs, no terror, no horror, no blood, no gore.
B00127RAJY|5.0|I have been a distance runner for some time but wanted to add something to my routine to tone up, to move out of a plateau. I am more interested in overall toning than weight loss and let me tell you, this video ROCKS. It may sound silly but I can easily run 6 miles with not too much effort because I've been doing it so long. I thought the Jillian DVD would be a breeze. WRONG! I still huff and puff through it in that awesome way that lets you know you are busting through a plateau.    I'm in almost at week 2 and already I see so much change in my body. You feel an overall tightness and toning by week 1 and after that it's so fun watching your body change. I read other reviews here saying don't wait to move up in levels, so I followed that advice. Do L1 one day, L2 the next, L3 the third day, then go back to L1 and do it all over.     The 20 minute time limit is genius because it keeps you coming back every day. I will update this at week 4 but so far my review is for anyone -  no matter what your fitness level - to get this dvd. Even for those who are already in shape, these workouts are fantastic.
B002VPE1WK|5.0|I followed the reviews and came upon this great bag. This is now my third camera bag, I had a cheaply made terrible construction bag, then I bought the lowepro slingbag which I love, but if I put too much stuff in it, then I get this awful shoulder pain, I still use it though, and would buy again!<br /><br />But this bag... this is like Felix the Cat's bag... you can put just about anything in it!!  Just to give you an idea, I put my nikon d3000 + 4 lenses, a fish-eye adapter, all the little accessories and filters, my mp3 player, huge skullcandy headset, my phone, and in the second pocket I can fit my Macbook 13 inch that has a Speck case. (Yes, it's a very snug fit, but on emergency situations where I can't really travel with too many bags it's a great option to have) oh and the magsafe and adapters for the mac, AND my kindle!. The construction is very well made, and far from not liking the Amazon tags, I love them, it looks like a regular backpack so it doesn't attract as much attention as a Canon or Nikon bag, and I've used it for other purposes as well. All in all, it's my fave bag at the moment.<br /><br />The support belts are comfortable, but I guess on a bigger person (I'm 5'4) or larger person they could not fit. I can fit it on my husband though and he's 200lbs. and not so tall. I haven't used the side straps... but I'll try to give an update when I do.

B004M6BQ9W|4.0|The critics were definitely wrong about this. This was very entertaining. Christina did a fantastic job. I think critics are out of touch with what people really enjoy and consider entertaining, and once that happens they really have no place in the movie industry.
B000R9EG3Q|4.0|This is absolutely a must read! Especially if you are a single mother raising a son. It is  absolutely encouraging, heartrending, and inspiring. Here was a man exemplified pulling yourself by your bootstraps. Its just makes you feel like don't ever give up hope because anything is possible. I must admit during the course of my listen at times it's a little humdrum. However, that is certainly not a implication of the entire book. Those are only parts. The story in its entirety is wonderful. Its gave me an insight of where the president came from, who he is,  his ideas and thoughts. I certainly have a new found love and admiration all the more. Love this President Obama! I am recommending that my brother and mother read this! Especially my brother.

Every time I try to download Inception via itunes, it comes up with an error message after a few seconds that the download was interrupted and I need to resume the download.  I resume it and the error comes right back up again.  itunes replaced my copy but it still doesn't work. It's the first time a download hasn't worked and every other thing is downloading fine on itunes.  My MacBook is completely up to date on software for everything--don't know if it's a Warner Bros code processing problem or an itunes problem. UPDATE:  I contacted WB and they sent me a code that worked fine.  Must have been the code.

1439102724|2.0|Music therapist Zoe Baxter and her husband Max, want desperately to have a child and all their failing attempts are starting to take a huge medical, financial and emotion toll on their marriage. When she suffers a heartbreaking stillbirth well into her last pregnancy, it is the final straw for the marriage and Max walks out of the house and out of their life together. Dealing with both these losses, very depressed, Zoe finds herself turned around by the friendship of a counselor at one of the schools she works at, a friendship that turns quickly (perhaps too quickly to be really believable) into a romance. Add to that the fact that her new love is a woman, Vanessa.<br />Quickly (maybe too quickly again) married in Massachusetts, the couple decides to get use the frozen embryos Zoe and Max have in storage to try and have a baby together, with Zoe's new spouse carrying the child. But when she goes to Max to get permission, she finds herself in the middle of a court case, being sued for custody.<br /><br />While I admit I have not read a lot of Ms. Picoult books, I totally loved My Sister's Keeper...and not just for the amazing ending. So when I read that she had a new book coming out, and the topics sounded so interesting, so timely, I was thrilled to get my hands on a copy. I opened the package and started reading it immediately.<br />Rarely have I been so disappointed in a book. Not for the controversial subject matter, no, not at all!<br /><br />On Zoe's side, the characters are almost saints, noble, good, selfless people. Even her lawyer, who will soon be getting a halo no doubt, is just such a nice person. How can you not agree with her? Zoe and Vanessa are so nice, how can we not want them to win?<br />On the ex-husband's side, everyone is evil and conniving, with totally selfish and nasty motivations. Max is a weak fool, with a reoccurring drinking problem, being used by others for their own, selfish, evil reasons. His lawyer is so loathsome that he only lacks a waxed mustache to twirl as he laughs a creepy laugh, to be complete. Yes, it is hard to portray people we really disagree with as decent people, with valid arguments..so much easier to paint them with a broad, ugly brush...and results in a book that could have been so much better.<br /><br />I think this books starts by exploring some serious and timely topics that deserve better than the caricatures that the author descends into in the last half of the book. I don't think we get far in a discussion, as individuals or as a society, by just painting 'the other side', whatever that might be, as fools or idiots or evildoers. If you agree with the author's point of view and just want that reinforced, you may like this book and not see a problem. If you really want a fair and comprehensive exploration of some of this issues, something that makes you think, maybe makes you take another look at both sides, you will have to look elsewhere.<br />Rarely has a book disappointed me so much for what it could have been and was not, because the author decided to take the 'easy' way out.as he laughs a creepy laugh, to be complete.

B003J27WFW|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this video because it really dealved into the very beginnings of the band, especially with the early home movies of Alex chatting with his parents and jamming in his home.  Then there is the great amount of time that Neil gave to being interviewed for this.  Since he so rarely does interviews it was great to hear what he had to say.  I was also really impressed with all of the artists that they got to speak to regarding Rush's influence on them (who would have thought that Kirk Hammet was such a fan).  It was such a wide variety of artists it just blew my mind.  This is really a must see for any and all Rush fans.  You will thoroughly enjoy it.

I thought that the Blu-ray SKU always contained premium special features. I was mistaken. Be sure to check the specs if you want the special features and not just the movie.

0743496736|2.0|So I admit, this book was a page-turner for me. I read it quickly and I found the plot interesting and not completely overdone, and the writing wasn't terrible. After I read it a second time, though, it really started grating on me.    I have two main complaints with it, and they were big ones. The first was that Picoult thought she was being deep and profound, and you could *tell.* Each chapter, each section, ended with a line that was unnecessary, a comment that didn't contribute to the story or flow at all but was put in there to emphasize that this was a thought provoking, insightful piece. However, these lines did was annoy me. I like stories that really make you think, not stories that repeat their points over and over and want to look like they're saying something.    The other issue was even bigger, and that was how heavily the author relied on cliches and stereotypes. I am a high schooler. I went to a public school. And high school is nothing like she described. It was just completely unrealistic. Yes, bullying exists, and yes, it sucks if you have no friends, but the social stratification is NOT this distinct and NOT this superficial and NOT this set in stone. Popular kids are popular because they have a lot of friends, and as a general rule of thumb, people who are total jerks do not get that many friends. I admit, maybe it would have happened as she portrayed it in Middle School, but by high school most people have matured and are at least more subtle about their bullying. The stereotype of Alex (the judge, the mother) was also tiresome. Yes, I understand she doesn't know how to talk to her kid. This isn't an uncommon problem. And yes, I understand Josie doesn't feel she has an identity. Well you know what? 90% of America feels the same way, and they deal with it. While this could have made the characters easy to relate to, they never did anything but whine, and so it simply made them annoying.    It's not a terrible read, really. It's just not exceptional either.

0061726826|5.0|Lena has been told all her life how the disease of Amor Deliria Nervosa (aka love) is dangerous. It is the disease that caused her mother to take her own life. Lena has been counting down until she is old enough to take the procedure to be cured because she doesn't want to end up like her mother - she wants to be happy.<br /><br />That changes when she meets Alex. Alex is wild and different and through the words he says he makes her feel beautiful. When Lena feels herself becoming infected, she starts to wonder whether the disease is really as dangerous as the government makes it out to be. As her procedure draws near, Lena has to make the choice of whether she wants to live this \\"happy and pain-free\\" life that will happen after she's cured, or find a way to escape and be with Alex without getting caught.<br /><br />Lauren Oliver has created a world that is believable and slightly unsettling. It's hard to imagine a world that has banned \\"love\\", but through Lena's eyes the world becomes horrifyingly real. Lena is the perfect character to tell the story. She has been harmed by the disease with her mother's suicide, and she can't wait to become cured so she doesn't have to worry about becoming infected. As Alex shows her that love isn't as dangerous as everyone thinks it is, Lena grew exponentially as she started to question the world she has grown up in.<br /><br />The story and pace had me hooked from page one as Oliver created this original \\"Romeo & Juliet\\" style story. It contains plenty of ups and downs that kept me turning the page. I can't wait until the next one gets released so I can find out more of Lena's story.

B0037KMHRY|4.0|I loved the movie and thought the music in it was great!<br /><br />So, it was a no brainer to go out and buy the soundtrack.  I'd hoped that the songs on it would've been full length and not just the bits as included on the film.  But, no, that's not the case.  Those songs were not full length ones cut down to fit the movie rather, they were soundtrack songs from the outset.<br /><br />Okay, I can deal with that.  I'm not happy about it but I can deal with that.<br /><br />After purchasing the thing I then learn there's a \\"deluxe\\" version that has all the tracks.  What?  Oh great.  Pretty sly, that.  Not happy to see such slithery marketing like that.<br /><br />Ah well, I do like what tracks are on this one.<br /><br />But, it could've been better.<br /><br />My recommendation is to buy it used.  That way, the pain of getting the lesser version won't be quite so much...
B003PIUBZS|5.0|Wow!  Riveting entertainment with some technical imperfections.  Many of the special effects are pretty obvious and the producers' decision to use an abundance of splashing 'blood' was a mistake.  Some sex is useful in the development of a story about ancient Capua and its major gladiatorial school but, in the case of 'Spartacus', its excess use verges on the gratuitous.  A comparison with the excellent--and also highly sexualized--HBO series 'Rome' is unavoidable and, overall, 'Rome' seems to be the more expensive and historically accurate production.<br /><br />Nevertheless, the above criticisms are relatively minor when compared against the pure movement, excitement and color that is 'Spartacus'.  The acting is very good and the plots excellent.  The writers take us on a tortuous journey characterized by deceit, murder and jockeying for power.  The gladiators are, in a sense, pawns in this very Roman struggle.  Their lives and deaths are to honor their Ludus and elevate the House of Batiatus.  The gladiators, themselves, go through a ruthless winnowing process.  Those who survive may become great champions of the arena with egos that swell to the near bursting point.  For many of these men, champion status is literally more important than life itself and, amazing as it may seem to us today, gladiator-slaves become sports' heroes the likes of which the world has never seen before or since.<br /><br />At the same time, 'Spartacus' let's us into the pain and privation of people who have been ripped from their private lives and sold into slavery--people who are no longer people.  Perhaps this is the point of some of the sex scenes.  Many of the women depicted are slaves ordered to service gladiators and others.  Much like the gladiators, who have little control over their quivering lives, female slaves don't have control of even their bodies.<br /><br />The gladiator/actors used in this film don't closely resemble the known biotypes of actual gladiators.  The actors seem to have undergone a bodybuilding regime producing low body fat and rippling muscles.  Actual gladiators--to judge by ancient drawings--seem to have been bulkier men with thicker waists.  My guess is that gladiator training was very different from bodybuilding and, not remarkably, the aim was quite different.  Strength and stamina would have been important, of course, but some body fat may, in fact, have not only increased stamina but may have actually added some marginal wound protection.bodybuilding regime producing low body fat and rippling muscles.

When he returns home, he decides to build weapons to help others rather than harm. He continued to work on perfecting his Iron Man suit and the results are really cool.     Jeff Bridges is the villain, Gwyneth Paltrow is ok but kind of boring as his assistant, and Terrence Howard, who I really like, plays his part well as the military friend of Iron Man.     Great special effects, good plot, cool techonological stuff. And really really cool cars. Good humor too. I love the suits, I love his cars, and I thought it all really well done.    We often have a tough time finding suitable family movies without tons of sex and profanity. This was great!
0802473156|5.0|I thought I understood love but not as well as I should have. Gary Chapman does an excellent explanation of five love languages. I have found these to be useful in understanding people and being better at building relationships. If you're married and wondering what happened to the love, read this.
B003UYV08E|3.0|I watched Iron Man 1 two nights ago and Iron Man 2 last night with my two teenage boys. I really enjoyed Iron Man 1 but didn't find Iron Man 2 as good. I did like the special effects though and found Robert Downey Jr. even better in that his character's sarcasm was very comical. We liked him a lot in it but just didn't find the movie as fun and interesting. The second half is better than the first though but I found the first half kind of boring.    In Iron Man 1, Downey plays Tony Stark, the owner of a company which builds weapons. He gets captured in Iraq and a magnet is installed in his chest to prevent him from dying. He uses this magnet in an invention, an \\"Iron Man suit\\", to excape from his captors who are forcing him to build a weapon for them. When he returns home, he decides to build weapons to help others rather than harm. He continued to work on perfecting his Iron Man suit and the results are really cool. Jeff Bridges is the villain, Gwyneth Paltrow is ok but kind of boring as his assistant, and Terrence Howard, who I really like, plays his part well as the military friend of Iron Man. I really enjoyed Iron Man 1 because of the great special effects, good plot, cool techonological stuff. And really really cool cars.     In Iron Man 2, Stark has now disclosed to the public that he is Iron Man and the fame has gone a bit to his head. The government wants his 'weapon', his board loses confidence in him, his friends become increasingly annoyed with his behaviour, and the magnet in his chest is poisoning him to death. Paltrow is back as his assistant, Pepper, but I don't like her character as much in this one; too harsh. and Downey of course is back as Tony Stark. But in this movie, Don Cheadle has replaced Terrence Howard as his military friend. I like Cheadle but much preferred Howard. Samuel Jackson is great as usual as is Mickey Rourke who plays the villain, but Scarlett Johanssen's character was boring and very unrealistic (yes, even for a super-hero movie).     I did enjoy the background about Stark's family and father, especially when he discovers a message left to him by his father which can save his life. And Robert Downey's character is even more enjoyable in this one ie wittier, more sarcastic, more foibles.     So, my conclusion is that it is still worth watching though not as good as the first. A good family movie though and quite funny.
B004APVI1G|5.0|This is not just a great storyline, but the colors of this movie are outstanding. Totally loved the effects of the 3D, just great. I can say, sitting next to my daughter we were doing the head dodging, body jumping and reaching out to grab things as the floated by our faces. The quality is just amazing. I found myself watching the credits at the end of the movie. Just an excellent all around movie. Totally was impressed. This movie sparkles and shimmers in all the right aspects of the special effects and over all design of the movie. Totally recomended.
B004BLJQOK|4.0|Chloe Grace Moertz will be a super star one day. Chloe did a terrific job as the lead vampire girl in this movie. I loved \\"Let the right one in\\" and I love \\"Let me in\\" as well. I just love the friendship between the two kids. You almost wish you had a friend like Abby when you were a kid. If you love horror movies this is not your typical horror film. There is a love story mixed in with the gory scenes. Also you are actually sympathetic to the killer who happens to be the young girl. This is what makes this story so unique. Not only are you hoping for the killer to get away you are also feeling sympathy for her. Abby is vulnerable even though she has super human strength. Chloe Grace Moertz rocked in \\"Kick Ass\\" she also did a terrific job here, as a vampire trapped in a 12 year old body. Chloe Grace Moertz has made very wise decisions in choosing her films. Just like Natalie Portman stayed away from kid movies, so far Chloe has done the same. I believe this gives her an advantage over other child actors. Some child actors are stuck with the perception they can only do kiddie movies. Chloe has already jumped into adult movies and is doing better than some adult actors. This is an excellent movie to add to your collection. If you saw \\"Let the right one in\\" this movie has some differences that make it also enjoyable. Ejoy this film and watch as Chloe becomes a star right before your eyes.

030746363X|5.0|What a weird book - and I mean that in the best possible way - it covers a pretty diverse set of topics, from biochemistry to female orgasm, but somehow it all makes sense.  I got hooked by the insulin-hacking diet concept, which seemed too good to be true, but I've dropped 20 pounds so far, so there must be something to it.  Even if you don't buy every claim, it's a joy to read about Tim's fearless self-experimentation - and who knows, you might lose a few unwanted pounds in the process.
076790592X|5.0|One of the most recommended books for life lesson. It reminds us of our most-basic-need of love and acceptance; and our most-needed attitude towards life, to be grateful.
B002RKRTGO|1.0|I agree with the previous reviewer.  I had begun reading the story from a book and had reached the end of chapter 2.  Back at home I loaded the free version on my Kindle and found that not only was the legend of the baskervilles that the client reads to Holmes missing, but the more recent newspaper account as well.  Pay the two dollars and get the complete book.  Who knows how much else is missing.
B003F3NDWG|5.0|I bought this series for my wife, not thinking I'd be that big into it (I'm generally not one for cop shows).  I'm pleased to say that I was wrong.  This show is great: terrific interplay between the characters (especially Fillion and Katic), the plots are well written and fresh, and the arc of tension between Castle and Beckett is entertaining to watch as it develops.    And for those of you who remember Fillion in his FIREFLY days, there's a little bit of homage to that in this season!    Definitely recommended, even if you're not a big cop-show person.  It's worth the buy!    J. Dean, Author [[ASIN:B001S2RBFG The Summoning of Clade Josso: The first descent into the Vein]] and [[ASIN:B00486UDGS The Summoning of Old Velt: The Second Descent into the Vein (The World of the Vein)]]

B004GF244K|5.0|This is a very interesting DVD Concert , I first heard one of the songs on the radio, the D J mentioned the video and I purchased it at some time in the future. Let me tell you what this Concert Rocks and is fascinating to watch as I am sure that it took quite some effort to pull off. Eric Clapton seems to be the main ring leader and I just cant explain how awesome the songs are performed the many various musicians that are involved. If you like Quality music buy this and put on the stereo sound and I am sure that you will be pumped up and singing out loud before the show is over. Great show really great show.
B00011RPB0|1.0|If I could give no stars for this movie, I would.  This movie has to be one of the worst I've ever managed to sit through.  In fact, I barely managed to sit through it.  I guess, I kept hoping a plot would actually appear.  The only movie I ever seen that was worse than this one (that I actually managed to see the whole thing) was the Batman & Robin movie with George Clooney.        I wanted to watch it because of good marks that Hollywood and the critics gave it and sat down thinking this would be a great and moving movie.  But I found it utterly boring and struggled to watch it to the end.  The actors are usually wonderful in what they do(LOVED SJ in Girl With the Pearl Earring), but even they need something to work with.  Bill Murray is one of my favorites, but this was clearly not the venue for him.        If the plot was about how hopeless and boring and meaningless life can be, then making a movie that was hopeless and boring and meaningless is not the way to go.  Tell a story, you silly people!!!!  This was a complete waste of time and film and the critics who love it so much need to seriously sit back and take stock of what makes a good plot and good characters and why we go to movies in the first place.  Of course, a movie can have deeper meaning to it (and should), but that should never get in the way of the story.  This story was ever so much about Hollywood patting itself on the back for being so cool and trendy and uber-intelligent, similar in some ways to another movie \\"I Heart Huckabees.\\"      To each their own, I guess, but if you like a movie with some action, some comedy, some pathos, some drama, and doesn't exist solely to take itself seriously...give this one a pass.  The popcorn was more interesting.
B002ZG99TK|4.0|Taking a cue or two from 1985's Runaway Train, Unstoppable is a breezy, flashy, yet undeniably entertaining Tony Scott vehicle.  Scott favorite Denzel Washington plays a veteran train-man who, along with rookie Chris Pine, find an ordinary work day going straight down the toilet when an unmanned train carrying toxic chemicals rages through western Pennsylvania.  Such things as story, character development, and even the laws of physics to a degree are inconsequential.  Despite that though, Unstoppable somehow manages to work regardless.  Washington and Pine are both insanely likeable, the action is wonderful, and the film is surprisingly suspenseful as well.  Rosario Dawson is also on board as a driven operator guiding our heroes along, and she fares better than anyone else here other than our two heroes.  All in all, Unstoppable is a fun blast while it lasts, and you can't really ask for much more than that.
B00009RGBS|2.0|Chicago, 2002 film    The movie opens at a nightclub. A young woman returns for her turn on stage, and sings. Roxie watches from the audience, then leaves with her boyfriend for her apartment. Did Fred lie to her? A bad career move. The police show up to question the husband and wife. Then we get a song to interrupt the story. The victim was a furniture salesman known to them. Was Amos a sap for confessing? \\"I'd kill him again!\\" \\"Once is enough.\\" Roxie is brought to \\"Murderess' Row\\" in Cook County Jail. Then we hear a song. [The changing format suggests a split personality.] \\"He had it coming\\" isn't entertaining or interesting, it just pads out the movie. \\"Murder is a form of entertainment in Chicago.\\" The all-male juries never hanged a woman. [Not true.] Roxie needs a good lawyer: Billy Flynn never lost a case. [Did he only take the cases he could win?]    Billy Flynn wants $5,000 to represent a client (love doesn't pay his bills). This \\"satire\\" doesn't amuse me. Amos stands by Roxie. Do they mock defense lawyers? Can they raise money for the defense by selling items owned by the accused? Can they generate sympathy with a story about her life? Rehearsing the witness' story? [They all do that; a trial is like a play where the audience decides on success or failure.] The song by Roxie seems deliberately tasteless. The next song plods along, and isn't funny or entertaining. [Was this deliberate?] Velma sings and dances. \\"Lay off the caramels.\\" Next Billy gets another client. [An unbelievable story.] Miss Baxter seems unusually feisty for a millionaire heiress. A tasteless story? Another boring song that takes up too much time. Is the defendant's dress and demeanor part of the act? Does the conflict between Roxie and Billy seem real? Another tasteless act with Catalina. [What is wrong with the writers?]    The trial of Roxie Hart begins. \\"I'm scared.\\" Is it all show business or another tasteless and ignorant statement? Roxie explains her \\"illicit relations\\". Is she well-rehearsed? What an act! \\"There ain't no justice in this world!\\" There is a surprise witness in court. [A jailhouse snitch?] The cross-examination of Velma Kelly is educational. [Note how this `evidence' was developed.] And so the jury delivers a verdict. [Would married men have sympathy for a man who fools with a married woman?] Then there are shots on the courthouse steps. Another sensation to capture the attention of newspaper readers. Billy Flynn never lost a case. [Did he access that diary?] And so \\"Andy\\" returns to his world, and this overlong musical comes to an end. \\"Isn't it grand?\\" Is there a future for Velma and Roxie? There is no business like show business.    I'll bet the original 1927 drama was better than this expensive production. Maurine Watkins wrote this play as a drama student at Yale. She had been a reporter for the Chicago `Tribune', and not in sympathy with the true crime cases used as a basis for her play. \\"The Girls of Murder City\\" is more educational and entertaining than this musical. Some people say they got away with \\"murder\\" but if you can justify a killing it is not murder. Maurine Watkins supported a religious college and was not a \\"Mary Sunshine\\" reporter like those who wrote for the Hearst press.
B0034G4OUY|3.0|Faster doesn't offer much in terms of explanation as it begins, nor does it have to.  After a man only refered to as Driver (Dwayne Johnson) is released from prison, he goes on a vengeance-driven spree with no remorse and little emotion involved.  On his trail are two cops (Billy Bob Thornton and Carla Gugino) and an ego-centric hitman (Oliver Jackson-Cohen), but even they can't derail Driver's mission of revenge.  The more that Faster reveals as its story progresses, the more interesting it gets.  That being said, the more that Faster progresses, the more predictable it gets too.  Still though, Faster delivers in terms of solid action set-pieces, and you can't really ask for much more than that.  Not to mention that it's good to see Dwayne Johnson in an R-rated action movie instead of more family-friendly fodder, even if the film's script squanders most of Johnson's charisma in favor of an emotionless demeanor.
B004MMEIK0|1.0|This book doesn't reinvent anything in the romance genre, but it still would have been a great read if the writer could have only breathed some life into her pages and her characters. While she had a few good ideas as far as the storyline, not giving anything away here by talking about the choco or diet blood to which some of the \\"hilarious\\" references might be aimed, she just never seemed to make the story become an escape for her readers. I never cared for the characters at all and I easily lost interest in the book a lot. Only purchase if it's free.
B00005U122|5.0|While I make no claim to being qualified as a reviewer of DVD or other media, I must say that this is my all time favorite music DVD. The sound on this is incredible, the songs are a mix of those I remember from back in the days of Pink Floyd but served in a new manner filled with excellent vocals and instrumentals from artists who were not a part of Pink Floyd. Roger Waters, one of the front men for Pink Floyd, stands strong on his own with the talents of these artists. The background visuals were stunning.<br /><br />I first saw this at a party and immediately asked the host for the name of the DVD, knowing that it was one I had to add to my collection. Well worth the money, it is a DVD I enjoy frequently. Roger Waters still has the voice and musical ability that leaves the viewer appreciative of his unique talents. The other vocalists and guitarists are a great fit and add their own unique talents to the songs featured. In a word........awesome!
1856697061|5.0|I purchased the first volume of Pattern Magic, and liked the approach the author takes to revising a sloper into an innovative geometric clothing design. I could draft a sloper but didn't know how to use the sloper to create a fashion design pattern until reading Pattern Magic. (A sloper is a basic fitted clothing pattern used as a basis for fitting fashion patterns.) This book filled a gap for me. By the way, Pattern Magic is translated from Japanese, so the format may be different from other sewing books you have read.<br /><br />I bought Pattern Magic 2 because I found the first volume so helpful. The approach is the same in both books; taking a sloper with darts taped closed, planning the geometric design for the garment and marking the design lines on the sloper, cutting the sloper so that it lies flat (this creates darts/pleats), and drafting the fashion pattern on a fresh sheet of paper by tracing around the resulting cut sloper.<br /><br />The last few pages of the book includes some small-scale slopers which can be copied or traced if you want to practice with paper on a small scale (the first volume also includes these mini-slopers).<br /><br />This book illustrates different geometric and pleated shapes for clothing/fashion design. The designs are a basis for helping the reader understand how to adapt a 2-dimentional sloper into a 3-dimensional clothing design. This is a book for advanced learning on how to create your own original designs for patterns that fit; it is not a book of ready-to-stitch patterns, instead it is a book of examples of how to transform slopers into patterns. The examples shown are detailed and illustrated.<br /><br />Overall, this is a helpful book for a clothing designer or advanced or professional dressmaker who wants to go beyond slopers. There are good beginner books on drafting slopers, so if you have not drafted a sloper, check out a more basic book detailing how to draft a sloper. The clothing designs shown in the first volume are different from those shown in this volume. I do not have a preference between these two volumes, but I particularly liked the pleating designs which are detailed in Pattern Magic 2.me are different from those shown in this volume. I do not have a preference between these two volumes, but I particularly liked the pleating designs which are detailed in Pattern Magic 2.
B002ZG99CC|2.0|This is another unnecessary remake starring Jaden Smith. The first was \\"Day the Earth Stood Still.\\"    While the choreography was decent and the viewer got to see some decent Kung Fu., I had many problems with this movie.  First the title. KARATE KID which had NO karate. More like the Kung Fu kid.  Why is this set in China?? It came across as a big ad for tourism to China.    This movie was basically a pale immitation of the original movie with the original lines \\"forced\\" into different scenes of this movie that did not capture the magic and drama of the original.  Jackie Chan was not charming but was simply bland. Pat Morita gave great charisma to his character. Every scene with Morita was memorable.  Jaden would not be in this dreck of a movie if his parents weren't bankrolling him. He is unlikable and his character is a punk.  The original character was a decent kid who was placed in a challenging situation.  The friendship theme seemed so pale in comparison to the original  Every thing seemed so scripted and just simply a carbon copy of the original.  The love interest scene was weak because the characters were too young. It would have worked a little better if the actors were older.  The bad guy instructor should have spoken some english. He also had no presence either.  The final winning point scene was much better in the original. The famous crane kick.  This version had some video game style kick that looked too flashy.  Again, the choreography was decent for the most part. It was the scripted acting and ripped lines that made this movie a blah fest.  Again hollywoood takes classic movies and remakes them into crap.  Another movie to add the the long list of bad remakes.  Next time, save us the money and simply re release the original into theaters.
B0045FTR0K|3.0|At 5:19 on the first track, some players (even high end models) will just jump to the 2nd track rather than playing the entire 7:06 of the song. Universal claims this is a player issue (yea, sure). The player I have is a Sony ES5400 which retails for $1,500.
B002ZG999U|4.0|This was a great action flick, lots of nods to other action flicks. I enjoyed the Stallone - AHnold scene. That was a great nod to their flicks.  The story was pretty basic, toughguys hired to get a job done, changes of alliances lots of explosions ect.  It was cool seeing all the main action stars from Stallone to Statham to Li.  Lots of fun injokes like Randy Couture's ear joke.    I would have liked a more climactic fight scene between Austin's character and two or more of your action heroes.  Other than that, this was a great \\"toughguys kickin butt\\" movie.  I reccomend

B001VNB54A|4.0|Stephen Spielberg and Tom Hanks did a slam-bang of a job creating The Pacific.  It has no equal, except, perhaps Finding Private Ryan, and for their equally brilliant Band of Brothers.    Forget about John Wayne's war dramas, forget about M.A.S.H., nothing compares to these three magnificantly produced war films.  I remember being blown away by Twelve O'clock High but it was a remote battle. Remote in that the men who fought and died did so off camera. Not so in The Pacific.    Clint Eastwood's Flags of Our Fathers and Letters From Iwo Jima were both excellent but I would place The Pacific, Band of Brothers and Saving Private Ryan a notch above Eastwood's fantastic duet.    All of the above have meticulously recreated the dirty and bloody aspect of war. My closest (fortunately) encounter with war has been to hear my brother in law recount his experiences in the Phillipenes during WW II.  He was in a special 50 Cal machine gun unit that saw heavy action there.  After taping his account (for the Library of Congress) I sat back and counted my blessings I missed that carnage.    As I watched Saving Private Ryan, Band of Brothers, and The Pacific, I again thanked God I was lucky enough to be born at a time that placed me between all wars.  The Pacific reiterates, time and again, what sacrifices our service men and women have made to give us the freedoms we enjoy today.    Well done.
B004FQKY5Q|5.0|Speak To Me did it for me... again.  This is what Roxette has been all about for me. I like all of their songs, but always on the first listen of one of their new albums you know from the first few notes that you've reached a gem. \\"Speak to Me\\" has that classic Roxette energy that we all love, I see it kind of like perfume ads from the 80's, you feel a level of danger and foreboding, like black jaguars and velvet (Per's part) and then here comes Marie from the clouds with her crystal clear declaration which is a positive and inspirational tone. It's that balance of light and \\"dark\\"/dangerous energy that makes the track great (listen to \\"Do you get excited?\\", and somewhere near the end they both come together in harmony.<br /><br />Per's musical writing seems mathematically perfect... the songs follow normal patterns (ABBA) etc.... the notes and runs are just where you would expect them to be - that's what makes them stick in your ming, and so much fun to sing in the shower. Even the timing and notes of Marie's \\"scat\\" interjections are perfect. Some think this makes songs simple, but it takes a genius to write songs like this. There are often amazing elements like many key changes etc. which some would say are impossible in one song, but you just sing along and don't even notice, and Per makes it work.<br /><br /> I'm a 37 year old professional, and people laugh at me sometimes when they learn how I like Roxette, if I could only get them to listen to tracks like this...<br /><br />I love when I have someone in the car and a track like this will come on, and they'll be like, \\"who is this, it's really good!\\" then they're sorry when I tell them it's Roxette.... lol
1439102724|4.0|What Jodi Picoult does well, she does REALLY well.  Her novels never fail to pull the heart strings, open the mind and capture the reader from word one.  Her talents cannot be denied and should not be underestimated.  Picoult is no weakling when it comes to being the heavy in terms of hot bed topics.  She just grabs whatever is making waves and weaves a story that, yes, leaves a mark on the reader.    I devoured this book, as I do with everything Picoult publishes (minus the comic book things she tried that left me scratching my head...I passed on that one).  I won't hash into what the book's about, clearly you can gather that information from the 8 other reviews and, of course, the synopsis.  But I will say this book follows the Picoult-formula to a T...heavy topic, likable and unlikeable characters, court drama, a last minute loop followed up with a happy ending.  Picoult doesn't depart from the tried and true, so this title deserves a full 4 stars based on the story, not the originality.      In today's word people are often lead by misnomers passed down from generation to generation, some as old as the Scripture itself.  That, in a sentence, is this novel.  What Picoult does really well here is open the eyes of her readers, and by doing so, opens their hearts.  The topic of same sex marriage hits the nightly news religiously (no pun intended) and her take on that, bringing it home and making it real for the reader regardless of his/her own personal experience, is something EVERYONE should read--regardless of which side you fall on.  Mix that up with a little infertility on both sides of issue and you'll be as compulsive as I to find what really defines a \\"happy ending\\" for everyone.    So...I'll leave it at that. This book is worth it, every little penny.  You won't walk away disappointed, heck you may even walk away a little changed and lot more informed.    On a side note: I bought this title on my Kindle and ergo missed the accompanying CD, so if you're goingto miss that, buy the hardcover.
B002ZG981E|1.0|Watching this movie was like snorting castor oil up into your sinuses.<br /><br />Just when I couldn't take any more, I checked and there's 1:06 to go!  What punishment!<br /><br />Can I put my finger on what irritated me so much?  Let's give it a try:<br /><br />1.  Premise not believable.<br />2.  Even if you buy the premise, its execution was not believable.  (Would dreams be so grounded in physical laws and realistic settings, and feature such clear-headed thinking?)<br />3.  Watching criminals try to succeed at something evil and nasty for two and half hours was unpleasant.  When is Hollywood gonna learn?  People don't like rooting for the bad guy, even if he is Leonardo Di Caprio.<br />4.  Did anybody really give a toss what was going on between Di Caprio and his wife?<br />5.  The script that's too clever for its own good has certainly been done before:  but this one was utterly predictable.  The final clincher:  \\"What is real, and what is not?\\" you could see coming from a mile away.  A lot of the movie's so-called \\"intelligence\\" boiled down to making jump cuts without any explanation, something it couldn't have done had it been a book.  In other words, the filmmakers were trying to be confusing.  It's more artsy that way!  It gets people talking!<br />6.  Yeah, one of the most confusing movies I've ever seen, for sure.  I hate confusing movies.  If I'm in the mood for something that convoluted, I'll just read a book.  It's true I only watched this once and a second and third watching might clarify much, but who would bother?  It's too unpleasant to watch.<br />7.  The whole \\"dream within a dream within a dream\\" thing might have worked well on paper, but by the time it hits the screen, the any possible poetic magic is lost:  you're just looking at a street scene.  It's like it was the audience's responsiblity to periodically remind themselves how wondrous the situation is, since the movie was unable to relay that visually.<br />8.  The fact that this movie is essentially 2:30 of unrelieved chase scenes gets on your nerves pretty fast.  Remember how Shakespeare would help to break up tension with some low comedy?  Not Nolan.  It's unrelenting, so you check out emotionally before long.your nerves pretty fast.  Remember how Shakespeare would help to break up tension with some low comedy?  Not Nolan.

She won't take any other pacifier and they are easy to lose and impossible to find in the dark.

B0042JTDXK|5.0|If you are expecting the \\"Classical\\" Josh Groban this is not it.  Here he takes a different turn.  The songs are mostly a similar speed and about every other one is in English.  The interesting thing is the use of his voice.  His voice ranges from normal, to head voice, to falsetto - an interesting combination of sounds.  I think you will either love the effect or hate it.  I do think it would make an amazing voice training CD.  In fact there is a musical transcription of this CD scheduled to come out approximately April 1.  I like the effect and have discussed this CD with my voice instructor.  The mixture of Italian in the CD perhaps distracts or is perhaps there to attract those who are expecting those types of songs.  I would like to see him do an album with just the more modern English songs and see where it leads.  Josh - please consider making this album.
B0030ZOYHC|5.0|Holy crap was this a beast of a movie! I had seen some episodes of the anime but I was too young to understand. After watching this, I've begun to understand a bit more (apparently the movies are trying to make things more clear) and I've had an awesome time enjoying the movie itself.  Evangelion 1.11 You Are [Not] Alone has a perfect blend of action, humor, and drama! Not to mention the animation is excellent, everything looks so clear! A definite must for fans of the original series, those who weren't that familiar with the anime series (me) or for anyone who just wants to watch a very good anime.
B003TQKVGU|4.0|Much of the writing or information in this book would be considered an earlier version of the book, 'The Secret'.  This copy does have chapters in it that you can forward to ... an improvement over a previous review. Even if you  think some of this is silly or mundane, it's a decent read for something a bit more uplifting. If you come away more open minded, willing to look at life differently, or just a bit more optimistic after a short read, it's certainly worth the price paid.   I like to go back and read individual chapters that are more meaningful to me,   so it makes this an inexpensive and positive purchase.

B003ZSJ212|5.0|Lucas is going to change the Special Editions around. For one, the effects look like crap anymore, he's not going to be happy with that. I also fully expect him to actually add in the deleted scenes, I don't see him just throwing them on a second disk.    He often wears a \\"Han Shot First\\" shirt to conventions... so hopefully he'll fix that. Honestly, if he switches that back and takes out the Jabba's Palace rock scene or whatever, I'll be perfectly fine with the S.E.
0756405890|1.0|I was actually given this book by a friend. Before reading it I looked around and saw how critically acclaimed it was. The Onion AV Club said it was the best fantasy debut of the decade. Needless to say, I was really excited about it. After reading it, I felt angry and betrayed (never, ever felt that way about a book before). I was angry at having wasted my time reading it and I felt betrayed that so many people/organizations reviewed this so well.    The other 1 star reviews have already trashed this book thoroughly, but unfortunately they are lost in the shuffle. Some of the flaws people have outlined I don't really mind. For instance, the anachronistic terms...I've never had an issue around an author using the term 'gunmetal' to describe a color in a medieval setting, that kind of thing. That's not enough to inspire enough hate for a 1 star review. I hated on this book for having a Mary Sue main character and terrible, terrible writing (see Liz's July 2009 review for some examples). I actively disliked Kvothe by the end of the book. If the supposed hero can elicit that kind of reaction, the author has done something wrong.    I've seen some criticisms of these negative reviews along the lines of \\"Why does this person only have a couple of bad reviews? They must be fake and/or hate everything.\\" People aren't inspired to write reviews of things they find average or mediocre. Personally, I wouldn't even if I really loved a book. With something like Game of Thrones, there are already 8 billion positive reviews...no need for me add another. With this book, I read it based on positive reviews. I expected so much more. That's why I'm posting a negative review. If this stops one person from wasting their time, then it was worth it.

It was really good. I loved Jace as I have read in other reviews that most people do. I loved his cocky so sure of himself attitude. This book has it all, action, adventure, a little romance. I loved how the author brought all the mythical beings into one book. Clary is a strong character and I enjoyed her story. Alec I did not really care for, but can't like all the characters sometimes. Clary, Simon, Isabelle and Jace just make me laugh. I loved the shadowhunter world, it was somewhat unique and fun. The middle to ending of the book has a major twist. I did not see it coming and almost put the book down because I could not believe that Cassie would change the story and characters like that. I loved Jace in the beginning but towards the end I thought he became to soft and weak. I hope he is more like himself in the next book. The plot flows really well and it's just a great start to what is I hope a wonderful series.
B001IBIHQ4|1.0|I didn't like it.  I watched only one disc of the set.  I was greatly disappointed.  Sold it to Media Play for what I could get for it.
0312600844|3.0|This novel pushes readers' buttons, but why?  Should a novel seduce or disturb?  Do you want elevated prose or journalism?  Pearls of wisdom or raw data?  To me, Freedom has touches of James Jones, Mailer and Roth, and lots and lots of Oprah, Ricki Lake and Roseanne.  Two sections are in the style of a woman undergoing analysis. Her therapeutic self-evaluation becomes the novel's.  Morality isn't equal justice or reciprocal liberty the way men have traditionally argued it, but the weighing and weighting of feelings: are yours authentic, borrowed, warped, reversed as to subject or object? whose feelings have been hurt and how much by withholding, abandoning, seducing, betraying? and; blame is measured in both motives and pain. The characters' arguments are endless as those of a child who knows intuitively how \\"maybe\\" proves everything and nothing.  Truth is in psychological causes, not political ones; and, real men melt, like Turandot.  A few stock villains, some with star turns, drop names like \\"noble lies\\" and allude to ends justifying means, but sweet talk (and cookies) carry the action forward, transcending such problems. The family romance is central; public life is picaresque.  Seeing all this privileged psychologizing as, say, serving/ serving up a reader's reaction formation with a regress taking in the real world, would spin War and Peace, but it seems more likely a kind of irony.  Reflexive theories aside, this is America at one of its babbling, boiling over, Brownian motion bests, make of it what you will.
0062064304|5.0|Today I recieved 'The art of District 9: Weta Workshop'    I have to say I'm really happy about it, the content is great, and the design of the book itself is very very nice.  It feautures everything from organic characters concept design, to weapons, typographies, logos, and lots of details. Thick pages, and beautifull images.    :D
B004DK5CW4|5.0|I bought this as a gift for our GrandDaughter and she loved it! We had movie night at our house complete with the lights out for the full theater effect! The movie was very enjoyable,especially the scenes with the horse running freely. I am thinking of buying a copy for our own personnel use.
0756404738|5.0|Most books, even very enjoyable books, have obvious flaws. I've read hundreds of fantasy books and it's common to find a book with a great story idea but the author isn't really a masterful writer. Or a book has solid writing but the characters are shallow stereotypes. So I was blown away by [[ASIN:0756405890 The Name of the Wind]], the first volume of this trilogy. The ideas were compelling, the world and its various cultures were well thought out, the characters leapt off the page, and there was even a fair amount of dry humor. I was pleased when I heard that the other two books of the trilogy were already written. I figured they'd be released shortly thereafter.    Well, it turns out that \\"already written\\" was a bit overgenerous. Patrick Rothfuss had a lot of editing and rewriting to do. I fumed at the delay because I was so enthralled by the first volume. Eventually I started to worry: how could the second volume match the standard of excellence set by the first volume?     I'm pleased to say that, if anything, Wise Man's Fear is a stronger volume than Name of the Wind. With the character of Kvothe already well established, Rothfuss is able to dive in to some of young Kvothe's most exciting adventures. He does a great job splitting the story between more mundane relationship-driven parts and the big payoffs of splashy magic and exciting fights. The story never bogs down, the pacing is wonderful. We see Kvothe using and expanding his skills and knowledge in ways that are entirely consistent with what has come before. There's no cheap \\"and suddenly I found the magic sword\\" deus ex machina moments.     A recurring theme is to juxtapose legend vs. reality. There's the legend of Kvothe himself contrasted with his current mundance existence as Kote the innkeeper. There's the legend of the Chandrian and the Amyr, and Kvothe's frustratingly slow path to find out any facts at all about them apart from children's stories. The legend of the fearsome Adem mercenaries vs. the slow reveal of the truth behind their fighting prowess and their mysterious silence. And of course the legend and reality of the fae Falurian, whom no mortal man can resist.     He has done such a good job setting up various sub-plots that I can't imagine how he can satisfactorily resolve them all in the final volume of the series. I have to admit I wouldn't mind if the series stretched to a fourth volume. It's simply that good.
B000F3A7LE|5.0|A lot of things have been said about Robert Fripp's EXPOSURE lp. [...]The cast that Fripp assembled and the shear talent in those musicians really shines through and, makes Fripp shine as well. Let's face it. You wouldn't be looking into purchasing this CD if you didn't know a little something of Fripp's past. What happened in between King Crimsons RED and  EXPOSURE was a journey that Fripp needed to take in order for him to explore his own creativity beyond his past musical outings and step out from behind King Crimson. I remember when i first listened to EXPOSURE and i thought to myself that, this was the new sound, the NEW WAVE so to say. Bowie (having worked with Fripp) took full advantage of this sound  with his albums LOW  and HEROS. Aided by Fripps monster angular guitar playing, Bowie created a sound that many tried to duplicate but couldn't. For anyone interested in this CD, Robert Fripp totally demonstrates where he is going, what he wants to do musically and that he is not afraid to take chances and explore the unknown. For those Crimson diehard fans who hated this and anything that followed \\"HEY, IT'S YOU'RE LOSS\\". This is a powerful statement both musically and culturally. Shall i be so bold as to say that anything Fripp works on as a solo artist is a prelude to the inevitable, an exploration of sound. No matter how you look at it, EXPOSURE is a dramatic step for Fripp. A step that, for the true Fripp fan, was a very appreciated recording. If Fripp was trying to make a bold statement with EXPOSURE, i believe he hit the ball out of the park. I'm not going to breakdown each song or each of the musicians in this review because EXPOSURE speaks as a whole. EXPOSURE won't disappoint, it will though enlighten.
B000FCKGPC|5.0|I saw so many bad reviews on this 4th book of \\"The Song of Fire and Ice\\" series....and I have to say, GRRM had me spinning again.  I can't tell you how many times I said aloud, \\"Whoah, did not see that coming!\\"  Oh, this story has so many twists and turns....he could take this anywhere....I saw hints of where this story is going.....my only disappointment is that he had to split this book and supposedly the next one was due out im 2008 and its now 2011....lets finish the story, for pete's sake!....

This is no disney performer. This kid is serius.
B00079FUI6|5.0|We're on season 7 at the moment and what an amazing 7 years its been since the very first series! I'll admit their have been some low points but most of the time Desperate housewives has always managed to keep its place as one of televisions most successful shows. I hope we see season 8, its probable we will though, so don't worry.
0307454541|5.0|I have to say that I am utterly amazed at the negative comments here. I read 5-10 novels a month, EVERY month, and found all three books to be very refreshing and enjoyable. I honestly have to wonder at the level of intelligence that these readers posess. It IS a little more challenging read than your typical novel, and that is something for which I am gratefull. I believe someone with a capable mind will find all three books to be the kind you will NOT be able to put down. I work full time and finished all three in a week. WISH THERE WERE MORE! The characters are amazing.
B003PIUC02|5.0|Spartacus Blood and Sand, instantly became one of my favorite shows!  I do not watch much TV, but this show has Action, Violence,Blood, Drama, Sex, and everything that makes me want to watch more!  Spartacus the TV show takes place before the revolt lead by Spartacus, there is not much historical information from this time, but the story is crafted well around the information.  This show can get really intense and graphic, so be forewarned.  It looks even more incredible on Blu-ray, totally worth watching!
B003JTHESA|5.0|At first I hated this album but... it grew on my after while, you have to give it time. Even Janick Gers said that it will take time for people to like it. He said how everyone hated Stairway to Heaven by Zepplin when it first came out but now everyone loves it. I agree with him, it took me awhile to like it but after about 3 weeks to a month The Final Frontier is an awesome album! tracks 2-9 are good, track one (satellite 15... the final frontier) would of been better if Bruce had more to the chorus than (the final frontier ohhh the final frontier)
0756404738|5.0|This was just absolutely amazing.  Took me 18 hours and I finished the book.  His characters are so detailed that the reader is brought into the story.  I really can't wait for book 3!
0307272702|5.0|Suprising,Amazing,Enlightening.What else can I say.  The writer has gone above and beyond providing facts to back up his theory.  This is not just a \\"One Mans Opinion\\" regarding why we gain weight and how to lose it.  The whole concept of modern dieting and recommended foods ,gets a thorough  examination on why the program has failed to deliver the desired results.   I am already seeing the effect of the recommendations by Mr. Taubes.  And enjoying my newfound diet. Everything that is spelled out in this book seems to be working for me. Thank You, Thank You....
B003YFIUW8|5.0|Fantastic read. Briliant use of language to make the reader truly believe that a five year old child was writing.
B004DK5CW4|5.0|This was a great movie. I especially liked the fact that it was a decent movie without vulgarity. It was family-friendly, exiciting, and heart-warming. I am glad that a wonderful movie can still be produced that doesn't have to promote sexuality, immorality, violence, vulgarity, etc.  Great Job!!
B0042FZWC0|2.0|I usually wait a few months after reading a book like this to give a review. However, this is the first time submitting a review for Amazon.     When I first read this book I was semi-entertained. However, I recently went through this book again and found many reasons why I should not recommend this book. This book is filled with some enteraining ideas. Some. However, its mostly filled with boring stories of how great life can be if you just think his way. What the author doesnt realize is that the life he describes may get you hijacked onto a somalian pirate ship (if you have that kind of time). The author talks about the great humanitarian missions he embarked on. Also very boreing.     Just read the conclusion the author comes to in the last chapter:    \\"I'm well aware that some of the ideas in this book will not be eagerly received by a general audience. If you've read this far, you already know that I'm not interested in reaching a general audience-but since this book is designed to help you challenge the status quo, you might as well know how the status quo will respond.\\"    You wrote an entire book and this is the conclusion you come to? Dont waste your money on this book.      Here is how the book is structured:   - Creating a remarkable life: Author assumes we are sleepwalking in this world, and we must  set our own life terms. We must fight authority and no follow conventional ideas.     - Reclaiming work: Author talks about competance and tries to make the case that Grad school is a waste of money and time, author recommends reading blogs instead (summarized). Also gives weak personal finance advice (advice is not worth the $ spent).     - Power of Convergance: talks about creating your legacy.
B0025UHKNS|5.0|Recently bought this for my son. He loved it. He had it up and running in no time at all and found it very easy to work. He's used it every day since he got it. Would definitely recommend it to anyone.

0670022411|2.0|I thought this book was a book of lost potential. It COULD have been the adult version of the Twilight saga. Yet, it was repetitive, at times boring/annoying, and full of cliches.     #1: If you've read Twilight, do you know how Bella is very mopey and stubborn, refusing to get out of the way of danger, putting numerous people/creatures in danger by doing so, and then lamenting what a selfish person she is...before she does it again 100 pages later? Yeah. That's the main character in this book, Diana. She's a witch, btw.    #2: If you've read Twilight, do you know how Edward is very stoic and secretive, torturing himself for loving a girl he wishes to eat, yet tormenting himself by constantly placing himself in positions where he must fight his animalistic impulses...before he does it again 100 pages later? Yeah. That's the other main character in this book, Matthew.     #3: Matthew seems to have conveniently over his 1000+ years of living ended up best buds with the greatest thinkers, scientists and astronomers in world history (Think the diminutive Will...for William Shakespeare). While this might have been funny one time, it is used SEVERAL times over. It's corny. Also, Matthew, like the vampires in Twilight, has accumulated an incredible amount of education and wealth, and therefore owns chateaus and sports cars.      #4: There were LOOOOONG scenes of tortured abstinence (Twilight-esque...again)where I literally flipped 15 pages before getting to the next scene. This was not a one-time deal. There were quite a few conversations or scenes that dragged on far too long to hold your attention.     #5: VERY REPETITIVE. For the entire book , there are about 3 climactic scenes. Between, the other hundreds of pages are flirtation and angst between the two lovers, and a very butchered, manipulated history of alchemy. Most of the abstinence plot line stems from the fact that witches and vampires are not supposed to love each other, a key driver in the plot. There are alsopages and pages of Diana taking a bath (not erotically. just the author wants you to know she bathes, apparently) and sleeping, eating and taking another bath, sleeping and eating. Over and over. With dialogue.     #6: The explanation of witch powers and history, and science tied into the plot make this book everything that it is, and that's not much. These provide the only components of the book that make it distinctive from the very many other books of this genre to come about on the tail of Twilight.     Overall, it's an indulgent, easy read. It won't challenge you (it's not meant to, but it probably won't really entertain either), and when you're done, the only reason you'll want more is because the book stops at the oddest place known to book endings. Maybe there is another book coming, but if not, the ending is ridiculously unsatisfying. Basically, the way the plot runs, and with the foreshadowing, a big show down is expected that never materializes.     I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS BOOK. With some better editing and more creative writing, it could have been a good thing.Too bad you can'tn do do-overs in publishing.
B003O86FMW|5.0|of the hunger games trilogy this is BY FAR the best book! I have read the series many many times and everytime i love it EVEN MORE! even though you have to read the hunger games before you read catching fire and you really should read mockingjay after so you know how the series ends if it wouldn't make since i would only read catching fire. And for the record i am team peeta all the way!!!!!!!!!!!!! Go Peeta!!:):D:):D:):D:):D:):D:):D:):D
B004L3AR0K|5.0|Outstanding mature drama with plenty of lighthearted moments.  Hathaway's performance was Oscar-caliber and she was robbed by not at least being nominated.    Perceptive and pointed screenplay that was both hilarious and touching at the appropriate moments.  I was amazed that Pfizer sat still for some of the barbs they took, though it was also a great plug for their products.  No surprise that it cast the meds field in a generally unsympathetic light, but no cheap shots were taken (I'm sure Mikey Moore would not have approved of its even-handedness.).  One scene (using actual Parkinson's patients) was so on-the-money about the trials endured by both them and their spouses/families that I'm sure it will be used for actual Parkinson's workshops.    Don't miss this one.
B002JVWR0Y|5.0|I bought this season of Dexter used, but you would never know it. The package and the DVDs were in great condition. Also, it got here within in the week I ordered it. This was a very good purchase, and I would recommend this seller to anyone.
B0042U94UQ|5.0|It is a good movie appropriate for all ages. My family enjoyed it and my brother who is 21 even wanted to buy it. It's a fine movie. It's not exactly as inexpensive as it COULD be but I'd say it's worth it.
B004DK5CW4|5.0|An excellent movie if you like horse racing. Tells the story of Penny Chenery's love of a special horse and how she and Secretariat saved the farm from bankrupcy. Lots of Secretariat races with a look alike. Black and white original Triple crown races shown after the movie.
B002PNAY9C|3.0|Now, I am a person who enjoys books that are long (too an extent), diverse characters (too an extent), several viewpoints (too an extent), and attention to detail (too an extent). This book had everything it needed to satisfy my needs and then some.     My problems include:   Eragon is so damn complicated that it keeps me from understanding him. He is vegetarian but is as blood-thirsty as they come. Especially, when he captures his prisoner from the Razac cave and wants to kill him.     The pacing of the story is incredibely incosistent. The dwarf \\"section\\" is too long to make sense. Did they really need that in the story to have everyone agree? Granted, the ninja dwarves will probably be back but still. The sword creation part is also too damn quick. they made a \\"Supa-Dupa\\" sword in under a day?And then they find the extremely hard to find metal so fast?     Length is something I enjoy. Trust me. But even I found this a tad too lengthy. Along with the spasmic pacing, it seems to go on forever.    Overall, I enjoyed this. It may seem like I did not but it was a fantastic book. I like attention to detail and such. By this book, howver, only if you read the past books.
B000066744|5.0|Tim Roth, equisite music. What's not to like?  I cannot believe this film just disappeared.  I actually never heard of it until NetFlix recommended it to me.  I was astonished! The costuming, the colors, the story, and, of course, the music all transport you to a magnificent otherworld where you not only understand why 1900 never sets foot on dry land but you want to join him and live your life in his perfectly splended world of water, beautiful people and music. I was totally carried away on waves of delight and wonder for the entiregty of the movie.  It is truly enchanting to those who can appreciate quality entertainment that relies on consumate acting, well-written dialogue, a truly compelling story and some of the most beautiful music I have ever had the pleasure of sharing. I only had 5 stars available, but I'd give it more if I could.
0765326353|5.0|When I first saw that Sanderson was releasing the first book in a projected ten book series, I decided to hold out. I liked (not loved) his Mistborn series and I lost interest in WoT long before Sanderson even became involved. Also, I really didn't want to get caught up in another series that wasn't complete and have to wait years to follow characters that I grew attached to(George R. R. Martin, anyone?) But after reading the reviews posted here for The Way of Kings, and not having anything else to read currently, I decided to borrow this book from my local library.<br /><br />WOW! I should not have held out for as long as I did! Although I have always given Sanderson credit as one of the best world-builders in the fantasy genre, what really impressed me in this book was his masterful character-building. Character-building is a dealbreaker for me, it doesn't matter how great the world is or how inventive the magic system is, if I don't care about the main players in a novel, I lose interest. There are four central characters in this book and, while I enjoyed each storyline, \\"Dalinar\\" and \\"Kaladin\\" were my absolute favorite! Dalinar is a a high prince and a tired war veteran who just may be going insane, and Kaladin is a slave who has tremendous leadership qualities and an unusual amount of good luck. Towards the end of the book, Dalinar does something that is so noble and selfless that it gave me goosebumps!<br /><br />After devouring this book in less that a week, I returned the copy to the library and immediately bought a copy for myself from Amazon, as I am sure to read this one a few more times! While I am still slightly resigned about being in the middle of another epic series, this one is definitely worth it! Sanderson now ranks in my top three authors, along with Martin and Rothfuss!
B0010358CQ|5.0|I have been doing online shopping a long time and my experience with this seller and with the item (and it's quality) was 110% excellent. The DVD was in perfect, store condition and it plays perfectly and nothing was missing. Shipping was also fast. Wonderful buy!
B0034G4OY0|1.0|This movie was a real disappointment.  I went in thinking \\"oh a nice little movie about people who can talk to the dead, this should be interesting.\\"  The reality; it was the slowest, most boring movie ever made.  It started out really good in the beginning starting with the huge tsunami but ever scene after that seemed to drag on and on.  I felt like I watched the same scene for over an hour.  Finally we get to the end and you're thinking \\"oh, how is this going to change Matt Damon's character?\\"  Answer: It doesn't change anything.  It left you with a cliff hanger and two actors staring at each other smiling.  It felt like watching a commercial for anti-depressants.  The only good part about this movie were the twin boys and their story.  Everything else could have been cut down severely.  I wouldn't waste money to see this movie in any shape or form.
B000ETQR3Q|5.0|The Nerf Longshot is an awesome dart gun. I have had it for five years and it still works great, and is one of the most powerful Nerf guns I own. The gun comes with 2 clips with 12 darts and the front barrel attachment, I also want to mention it really does shoot 35 feet unlike the longstrike. Overall great gun 5 out of 5!
B003L77GH4|5.0|I actually don't like the twilight series at all but this series had me captivated with the way the actors played their part. Especially Damon and Katherine ( ahem Nina, Paul, Ian, Candice).... Superb! I was hooked! Each Episode Gets You Gripped to what is yet to come. It has everything from romance, to heart break , and revenge. Its a must for all Vampire Admirers. Its something fresh that keeps me interested. I am not a teenager by any means but still me and my Boyfriend come home from work and go straight to the DVR to watch the current Season. Its Great I hope it can keep the intensity going all the way through the end. I recommend Blue-Ray for Crisp better quality. You Must Have This If You Are a Vampire Diaries Fan! I know I am! The intense depth of How Ian manages to portray Damon is fascinating. I can't wait for Season Three to continue. Its a All Star Cast and to think we never heard of these people before Vampire Diaries! Granted I have seen Ian in Lost but he has so much character as Damon. Klaus is just as good too! I hope they continue to keep the energy flowing....
B002VPE1XY|3.0|I bought this case at the same time I bought a digital camera, online at Amazon. I trusted that since Amazon recommended it with this camera, it would fit. It was off by just enough to make it impractical for the camera. I had to shove and push and shove and push to get the camera at least covered by the case, but couldn't close it. Off by about 1/8 inch after all that. Nice case, but useless to me now--plus I returned the camera--not a great camera! It's a waste of money to me to return the case. I did love the book I ordered on that same order, so at least one out of three items was fantastic. Ah, the perils of shopping online. I learned a valuable lesson: visit my local camera store. It may cost a bit more but I can get advice from a person who knows what he/she is talking about, and try my purchase out for myself.

I have used and abused this knife since I bought it and it has held up and even kept it's edge thu it all. I recently purchased a set of micarta scales for it which I love. They are not a needed item since the ones that come with it are good but the micarta ones look great and feel a little better in my hand.

B004FQKY5Q|5.0|Definitivamente este es uno de los duetos mas extrañados en los últimos años, muchos éxitos entre los 80's y 90's una voz de Mery impresionante, este CD es muy bueno vale la pena, el disco 2 es para coleccionistas como yo material en vivo 12 canciones impresionantes, esta edición son de las que después uno dice lastima que no lo compre ahora esta fuera del mercado, próximamente en mi pagina [...] pondré el video unboxing de este gran disco!
B004LGPBZI|4.0|I wasn't entirely sure what to expect when I got my copy of 'Different Gear, Still Speeding'. I had previously heard the first single, 'Bring The Light', and was not particularly impressed with it, but not turned off by any means. Then I heard 'Four Letter Word' and 'The Roller' and thought they were fantastic rockers that would define this album. To my unfortunate surprise this was not the case.<br /><br />I am a long-time Oasis fan and love every single entry in their catalog, and normally I would not even mention Oasis in this review and look at Beady Eye in its own respect. However, I cannot shake Liam's howling for months prior to the record's release how 'Different Gear, Still Speeding' will be \\"better than Oasis\\" and that soon enough people will be naming their children 'Beady Eye'. The album just didn't live up to Liam's hype, but I honestly never expected it to. Oasis is a definition of rock & roll music, while Beady Eye, though containing veteran musicians, is still in its infancy.<br /><br />Putting aside the Oasis/Beady Eye comparisons and reviewing this album as originally intended, it still came as a slight disappointment from the band. Gem and Andy are both excellent songwriters and Liam's voice has noticeably regained its power since the latter touring days of Oasis. There are some true gems on this album, but a lot that feels like filler. 'Wigwam', the longest track on the album clocking in at 6:39, still manages to be forgettable.<br /><br />It is very clear what this album was trying to be: a hark back to 50's and 60's rock & roll oldies, and there's nothing wrong with that - those were defining eras of rock music evolution. However, what lacks with 'Different Gear, Still Speeding' is the same memorability of those oldies that influenced this album. Everything sounds very polished, unlike the dirty, raw sound of (sorry, again) Oasis that made us fall in love with them.<br /><br />In sum, I really wanted this album to blow my head off. It failed to do that, but it still gave me some good toe-tappers and my fix for oldies-inspired rock & roll. Beady Eye will never rise out of the shadow of Oasis, but they do not have to in order to make great music. There's a bit to take away from this album, and a bit to leave behind. Ultimately, I am disappointed it didn't live up to Liam's hype and my hopes of a truly rocking album. Still a solid record and miles above the majority of mainstream rock today, which is why it still gets a 4/5 from me in spite of its underwhelming nature.<br /><br />I'd recommend a thorough listen, but if you are an Oasis fan you may be confused and disappointed with this one. If you can treat Beady Eye as a separate entity as I have, you will find enjoyment from these songs. You may not be swept out from under your feet, but you'll bob your head back and forth; I'll still be playing this one time and time again. I'm hoping that prior to the inevitable Oasis reunion Beady Eye pump out a sophomore album with a few more rockers.<br /><br />Personal favourite tracks:<br /><br />- The Roller (possibly the best song of 2011)<br />- Four Letter Word<br />- Millionaire<br />- Wind Up Dream<br />- Standing On The Edge Of The Noise<br /><br />-----<br /><br />Next day UPDATE: Well, after at least 4 or 5 complete listens of the album, I must say it has grown on me. I got over the initial surprise and confusion to be able to enjoy a great album. There are still a few things that keep it from getting a 5, however, so my rating stands as is.ome good toe-tappers and my fix for oldies-inspired rock & roll.

0838577016|5.0|As an undergraduate studying neuroscience at a technical institution, this book has been a phenomenal source of information for every single one of my courses. This is also the book that I see on nearly every one of my professor's book shelves, and I can very easily see why. Kandel's book takes a scientifically literate read from the neuron to cognitive functions and everywhere in between, leaving no detail behind, and approaching each topic from a rigorous, investigative point of view. I not only learn neuroscience from this textbook, I learn valuable lessons on how to be a neuroscientist.
B000H5V8DG|5.0|For those (like me) that are skeptical about purchasing this box due to faulty packaging referenced in many previous reviews.  I'm not sure when they started this exactly - but newer copies of the box have the individual DVD's packaged in thin plastic sleeves that prevent scratching.  All of my discs look brand new, without any glue or scuff marks on them.  I'm not sure if there's any way to tell from outside the box if it's a newer or older pressing, but it does look like Buena Vista finally addressed the situation.  I'm guessing even if you do receive an \\"old\\" version of the box that has scratched discs they would be willing to replace it with this one.
0061801313|4.0|Firstly, I couldn't find these books' coleccion in Spain, even if I was looking for it at the best book stores in Madrid.<br />Then, I decided to buy on Amazon and I realized it was cheaper than any other place.<br /><br />Besides, when I bought it, I selected the cheapest option for receiving, which means to wait almost one month to receiving (at least, it is what Amazon said when check each sending option), but I received all books y ten or twelve days. I was completely surprised.<br /><br />Also, all books were new and did not have any damage.<br /><br />I will buy again at Amazon next time. Thanks. M.

B002ZG980U|5.0|As other reviewers stated this is a good movie.  But I wanted to bring attention to the original score by Hans Zimmer.  Though he didn't win an Oscar, the dramatic score really fit this movie.
B001AQO3QA|3.0|I don't really want the entire trilogy.  The first one was scary (really scary).  After that they were just comical.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|alas, the final book. so sad! It didnt turn out the way any of us expected but it did come to an end. Which makes me sooo sad. I was hooked on these books, couldnt put them down and now its over. Whats next suzanne collins???????????
B001E45XT4|2.0|After viewing a bunch of reviews for the Gamecom 367 closed ear gaming headset, I was pretty excited about getting such a great deal on what seemed like a universally praised set of headphones. I was not happy with what I received to say the least.    Sound  The sound on these things are absolutely horrific. Even if you are not an audiophile, you'll immediately notice that THERE IS ALMOST NO BASS. I thought it might have been a driver issue or my laptop had its audio settings set on \\"0\\" for bass, but it was neither; it was the headphones itself. At medium frequency to high frequency sounds, the headphones do a mediocre job. Yes, you CAN hear most sounds when gaming and they'll benefit you as opposed to having no headphones. But I own a cheap pair of Sony headphones (which I now still use to play counterstrike and ps3 games) that I had purchased back in 2005 and those possess better sound quality than the Gamecom 367's.    Comfort  An even weaker feature to these headphones are how they feel when you put them on. The cups are locked in place and unable to rotate in ANY DIRECTION, a serious design flaw. After 20-30 minutes of wearing, my head hurt even after trying to adjust the cups numerous times. I had seen the tigerdirect review where the guy said he had worn them for 3 hours straight with no discomfort. Absolute bull. No matter how thin your head is around the temples, the cups literally CLAMP onto the sides of your head. I've gotten dizzy after wearing them after an hour. There is absolutely no way anybody can be comfortable wearing these headphones. The velvet padding is a plus, though barely helpful since they're smashed against your temples.    Microphone  This is perhaps the only good thing about these headphone (aside from the velvet pads), but there is no way in hell it'll make the headphones worth buying. The sound quality on the microphone is great and when I teamchat with my buddies, they can hear me just fine. I even tried recording myself with the microphone on this headset and there was practically no background noise. This is a plus but the only plus.    All in all, I am SHOCKED by how many people consider these headphones a decent set of headphones for its price. It has horrible sound quality and only people with thin heads can find any comfort by the deathgrip the cups have on your head.    BUYER BEWARE. STAY AWAY FROM THESE HEADPHONES.
B000YIGNKE|3.0|Marcy Gomez, who gave this production four stars, lists some flaws very well. However, I'll point out the additional problems that made me rank this lower (perhaps even closer to two stars).      (1) I found it jarring that the actress stared into the camera constantly. I suppose they were trying to do something artistic, showing us inside her soul and all that. However, I groaned in prophetic anticipation whenever she did this (which was very predictable).   (2) I found her fluttery trembling kiss at the end laughable. Was she a butterfly? Was this the reason she always stood with her mouth half open?    (3) I won't comment on Sally Hawkins' ability to act. However, I don't like her Anne. I think this has partly to do with the interpretation that this production takes and partly with the actress.          (a) This production seems to make Anne weaker than she really is (or as I imagine her to be). For example, she makes a side comment to Lady Russell passively aggressively blaming her for the past, but then says she doesn't blame her friend. When she misses dinner with Wentworth to watch over her nephew, Anne gazes longingly in the direction of the main house. She spends time carefully choosing her dress for that dinner. While this definitely could have happened, and I wouldn't have faulted Anne for it, this production seemed to emphasize her weaknesses rather than her strengths. Where's the part where we get to like her, not just feel sorry for her as she apparently wallows in self-pity and martyrdom? I know they were going for suppressed emotion. I get it. I just don't think this was well done. I end up more embarrassed for her than anything else.           (b) The actress is pretty unattractive. I thought that they'd perhaps follow the novel and show at the end what a change comes over her appearance upon renewing her relationship with Wentworth. Nope. That never happens. She stays unattractive. They didn't do her favors by giving her some pretty dowdy looking clothes. While Anne isn't supposed to be a beauty or an extravagant girl, she isn't supposed to go around looking so poor. I was able to ignore the fact that Hinds (in the 1995 version) is far from gorgeous because the adaptation felt so true to the original. So, I think I could have done the same here with this Anne, if I had found this Anne likable. (As a side note, while the lead actor here is pretty handsome, I wasn't overly impressed with his acting. It just seemed to suit the purpose. Maybe someone can convince me otherwise.)     This interpretation didn't work for me (and I'm not a purist). Part of the charm of the 1995 version, to me, was it was able to give you a taste of how dull Anne's life was after refusing Wentworth. So, yes, it felt a little slow. However, it was very much in keeping with the tone of the novel. Instead of distracting you with the beautiful scenery at Lyme and some of the wonderful music like this production does, the 1995 one focused on Anne and Wentworth and the quiet intensity of their feelings. You didn't need magic camera work to manipulate.
B00136JU7Y|2.0|This is just another review about how it was redone. I bought this before buying the 1995 version. This has way too much drums and bass. I am usually one of the last people to normally say such a thing as you cannot have too much bass and drums. However, the original album was done with the right mix of everything, never forgetting Randy Rhoads. The original sounded cleaner. This sounded more overproduced and out of sync at times. Since I listened to this album hundreds of times as a teen, it was ingrained in my head. I knew instantly that something was wrong even after hearing it years later.    The type of sound system you have determines how apparent that it was redone. Your handheld MP3 player may not make a difference. However, a high-end home or car sound system will bring out the blatant differences right away. It is very obvious. A couple songs don't have much difference but my biggest annoyance was the killing of Randy in \\"You Can't Kill Rock And Roll\\".     Since getting my 1995 version, this version will just sit on my computer, taking up space. It is out of my library as of now.    The original album is one of my all-time favorites. This version is not that album that Ozzy fans loved. I do not like this reproduced, remastered, or re-whatever version. Period.

B004L3AQFG|5.0|This is one of the most compelling films I've EVER seen, and, so far, I've seen it four times.  Word of mouth seems to label \\"127 Hours\\" as a movie about a guy who cut off his arm; it's SO much more.  Aron Ralston's courageous story of survival, determination, hope, good and bad fortune, glory, and love of family, adventure and the environment along with revival and rebirth is the most inspiring and glorius episodes I have encountered.  From his near death prophetic visions, to his struggles with the elements & lack of food and water to his creative handling of his close encounter with death, I found this film a well produced, amazingly acted and perfectly directed retelling of one man's struggle with the elements that brought challenges that even the most determined outdoorsman could overcome, let alone survive.  The screen play is as imaginative, inspiring and emotional as Mr. Ralston's book, BETWEEN A ROCK AND A HARD PLACE. It's rather sad that due to lack of cinematic time, the film ends with Aron's triumphant rescue, since many new challenges awaited him, like Aron's stuggle with bone infections, which are inspiringly detailed in his book. Without a doubt, \\"127 Hours\\" is now my favorite pieces of cinema creativity, along with Aron Ralston's inspiring life and epic story of survival and living.  As far as the DVD release goes, it's a gem...at least the blu ray edition I got from Amazon is!  Commentary by Danny Boyle, Christian Colson & Simon Beaufoy is revealing, fun, informative and appropriate!  Deleted scenes are interesting, and include a very lengthy and more detailed alternative ending (although it's wonderful to see, the ending used was the appropriate one); the \\"Search & Rescue\\" featurette features the real Aron Ralston, his mother, and various other actual people from the absolutely timely and miraculous salvation of the amazing Mr. Ralston, who must have more character than most others on earth...for instance, when the chopper landed to take the exhausted, near-dead, dehydrated, hiker away, Aron was worried about soiling the helicopter's seat with his blood; \\"127 Hours:  An Extraordinary View\\" is another wonderfully detailed featurette that is an involved and interesting 'making of...' document.  I still can't figure out why the unbilled short film \\"God of Love\\" is here, other than no one could figure what other DVD to stick this thing on...but the good news is you can just skip it.
B004NFB4EO|5.0|I love this song - great lyrics, wonderful beat, just makes you want to get up and dance. Another amazing hit from Lady Gaga!
B003XOAJ6K|4.0|I'd give it five stars, but then what do you give Rio? So it's stuck at four. Sorry guys. If you are interested in this, you probably already know the album, and it's a great one. It's got house, rock, rock-house, house-rock, great dance songs, and the most unique Duran Duran song of all (All She Wants Is). Land is a great tribute to \\"For Your Pleasure\\" era Roxy Music, and I suppose Palomino is too. Some folks don't care for the artier side 2, but I dig it. Maybe a bit too strong a piano sound on Too Late Marlene, but that's about it. It's great to have the singles, b-sides, and remixes in the same place (the remixes of Big Thing and I Don't Want Your Love are superior to the album tracks). I haven't watched the video yet, but that's nice to have.<br /><br />If record companies had put together awesome packages of art, music, and video like this 10 or 15 years ago, the album and cd formats might not be on their deathbeds. But they are. These will be nice keepsakes of the era. Or just download all the songs. They are worth it.
B003YWUTJI|4.0|The CD meets my expectations, then some.  Norah Jones' voice soothes the soul, and with this collaboration with other icons is totally a bonus.
B004I2K4E8|3.0|So I am a huge fan of this show, I have multiple recordings and for years loved watching the 10th Anniversary Dream Cast concert. I was so excited when I saw this was coming on Blu Ray and I bought it without even watching any previews or reading any reviews of the actual London concert.<br /><br />Is it a good concert? Yes. The staging is impressive and the Blu Ray treatment gives you flawless video and audio quality. The performances are good but nothing like the stellar performances of the Dream Cast.<br /><br />There are a few notable exceptions, I will keep this disc and treasure it for Lea Salongas performance as Fantine. Her pristine voice and great acting ability knock her performances out of the park. A great treat to see her 15 years after the Dream Cast going from Eponine to Fantine . And speaking of the Eponine, Samantha Barks did an amazing job in that role. She was completely unknown to me before this and had huge shoes to fill in my mind and to my shock and immense pleasure she did just that. The last note in On My Own had me standing up and cheering. I won't say she is better than Lea Salonga in that role but she absolutely holds her own.<br /><br />Nick Jonas is a complete distraction in this show. His Marius has none of the depth that previous performers have given that role. His singing skills are not up to par with the material. Being fair though he did do a DECENT job on Empty Chairs at Empty Tables, but it no way has the impact that the song normally has on me. He brings down many of rousing anthems and really keeps them from reaching the soaring heights they normally would like. One Day More is the song most affected by his lackluster performance but Red and Black and Do You Hear The People Sing are equally watered down.<br /><br />There is a saving grace on this disc and that is the finale after the show ends. They bring back the original 1985 cast for One Day More and it had me leaping out of my seat. Also the original Valjean sing Bring Him Home with his contemporary was quite stirring. Having Michael Ball on the stage reprising his role as Marius reminded me how it should have been.<br /><br />There are some things on this disc that are magical and worth owning but as a whole it was flawed in my opinion.<br /><br />So the end result is this, I will be keeping the blu ray for Lea Salonga and Samantha Banks performances however I will also be ordering the 10th Anniversary DVD which has finally been re-released after being out of print for many years.<br /><br />My wish as I said in the title of this review is that the 10th Anniversary Concert got the blu ray treatment.as quite stirring.

B003UYV08E|2.0|More is less in a disappointing follow-up to the 2008 Marvel Comics blockbuster. &#34;Iron Man 2&#34; lacks the qualities that made the original so engaging. The inimitable Robert Downey Jr. and a stalwart cast are wasted in this overlong, badly paced superhero saga. Jon Favreau's once-sharp direction goes on autopilot — weighed down by Justin Theroux's needlessly cluttered, drawn-out script. Plenty of CGI overkill, yet precious little excitement. The already-planned &#34;Iron Man 3&#34; has nowhere to go but up.
B004MMEIK0|2.0|I was looking forward to this book and was intrigued by the story-line, which was very interesting in the beginning, but one third of the way through, it just lost it for me. The intriquing story-line fizzled and turned into predictable mush. There was no humor and so help me, if Roman said, \\"God's blood\\" one more time, I'd have thrown my Kindle across the room... But, I love my Kindle, so I didn't do that. Had it been an actual book, I would have. :)
0060090383|5.0|I've read three or four of Marian Keyes' books and while I've enjoyed them all, this one is my favorite by far. Which is strange because I thought I was not going to like it that much, since I am typically not into books about addictions/drugs/drinking. But Rachel and the other characters are so fleshed out and universally relatable, and the story is both funny and moving. If you're hesitating at all, give it a chance and I don't think you'll be disappointed. I couldn't put it down.

B000001GXB|5.0|The piano sonata is a little drama in itself, each one evoking some theme or emotion.  In this case Beethoven is a romantic master expressing his deep feelings and agitated spirit on it´s own scores.  The same way Pollini knows well how to extracts and show us this deep an diverse emotions wrote dryly on the pentagrams.  If you like this platform and Beethoven, this set is a delight, masterly played, getting all the strength of a young and blood Pollini´s in a crystal clear recording. Highly recommended.
B0002J4ZWS|5.0|I was determined not to watch another \\"prison\\" movie chock full of violence and man-rape, but people kept suggesting this movie, so finally at the age of 30 I watched it. I can honestly say I was blown away. Riveted from beginning to end. This movie is a \\"prison\\" movie, but also much more. If you've never seen it, take a chance.
B0042U94UQ|5.0|Great movie! Both my 9 yo daughter and 12 yo son loved it. Plus it has a really nice ending :o)
B0025UHKNS|5.0|This watch is amazing. As a runner in a new city, the forerunner helps me track my mileage while trying out new runs. I'm in DC where GPS can be tricky, but I haven't had any problems attracting the satellites and tracking my miles!
B004BLJQOK|4.0|What would it really be like to live as a young vampire? This film explores that topic. This film explores the dark and dreary side of being a vampire and what you would do to get your precious life-sustaining blood. This is an accurate portrayal of such an existence if it were \\"real\\".<br /><br />The two lead characters carried most of this film, and they were fantastic. The girl whom plays the vampire did a terrific job. Her character is desperate to survive. She is intelligent and street-wise. Her bloodlust is uncanny. The smell of a drop of blood turns her into a raging beast. There is no corniness or cheese-factor in her character. Remember, this is not about the fun of living forever. The relationship she develops with a weary, quiet youth has plenty of twists and turns.. and thrills.<br /><br />Also, I absolutely loved the fact that this takes place in the 80's. I remember when I first attempted to de-scramble a Rubic's cube (I later discovered you could take it apart). I remember eagerly spending every last quarter in my pocket at the local arcade. Pac-Man was everywhere... from 7-11 to the bowling alley. The spinning of the Greg Kinn record on the turntable brought back memories!<br /><br />My only complaint is that many scenes were very dark, as far as lighting is concerned. I understand that this was necessary as far as the story goes, but there were points where I could not see anything on the screen for minutes at a time... then all of a sudden...<br /><br />Oh, and I have yet to see \\"Let The Right Ones' In\\", so I am not comparing the two.. and I have nothing to compare it too.. I will check the other one out for sure since everyone that bashes this one says the Swedish original is better and this is just a fake copy.<br /><br />Justin Beiber got a haircut! All is right with the world! Until then folks...
0060936223|3.0|The only problem I had was that for some reason the book I got was cut really poorly so that all the pages are different lengths at the books edge. So, if you need it and don't care and want to save a few bucks buy the cheapest one.    The book itself memorializes the 70s so it is interesting to get a perspective from the hard rocker Patti Smith.
B000K1P66W|3.0|I enjoyed this book.  It had a lot of positive concepts that can really improve my life.  Worth the read!
B000IMUYJM|4.0|Really, it can be.  Think about it.  People act really crazy around the holidays.  They camp outside of stores in the freezing cold hours before the store opens so they can buy the latest video game system.  When the doors open, they stampede inside and literally run to the product they want.  They fight with other customers over who gets the last remaining item in stock.  People get loaded around the holidays.  When that happens, look out.  Who knows what people are capable of once they get some drinks in them.  Road rage is rampant.  The kids are excited.  The relatives are coming over.  Cookies need to be baked.  The tree needs to go up and be trimmed.  The trees and shrubs outside need some Christmas lights.  The snow needs to be shoveled.  The gifts need to be purchased.  The gifts need to be wrapped.  The CD player needs some Christmas music.  Party trays need to be purchased along with ice cream, cake, beer, wine, etc.<br /><br />So, calm down everybody.  Take it easy.  Unwind.  Sit down and watch a Christmas classic.  You know, Santa Claus Is Comi......wait, I mean, it's called Black Christmas.  Just when you thought you could escape from the stress of dealing with everything described above, I recommend this Christmas horror classic.  That's right - a HORROR movie.  If the above described things associated with Christmas stress you out and make you miserable, then you might as well prolong the misery.  Really, what's the difference?  You're already miserable, you might as well top it off with a scary Christmas movie.  Seriously though, I think watching horror movies during the holiday season actually helps deal with stress and helps one to escape for a few hours.  They work.  Sit in a dark room and be taken into another world for a few hours.  Watch Black Christmas, this original version from 1974.<br /><br />This Canadian horror movie basically is about a sorority house in a college town that is terrorized by a psychotic killer who makes many obscene phone calls.  The suspense slowly builds as the movie progresses, but the movie is never boring.<br /><br />This movie stars Olivia Hussey, Keir Dullea, Margot Kidder, Andrea Martin, and John Saxon.  This movie was really the first modern slasher horror movie.  This movie has been influential to many horror movie makers, especially John Carpenter.  You'll see similarities between Halloween and Black Christmas.  The first-person point-of-view camera technique is the main thing you'll notice.  Also, what is it with these two movies?  The phone rings off the hook!<br /><br />The movie is 98 minutes long.  The extras on the DVD are good, which include The 12 Days of Black Christmas, a documentary on the making of the movie, including interviews.  There are also interviews with Olivia Hussey and Margot Kidder.  Also included is Midnight Screening Q & A session and two newly discovered original scenes.<br /><br />Have yourself a scary little Christmas.uspense slowly builds as the movie progresses, but the movie is never boring.

0525421580|5.0|I loved and adored Will Grayson, Will Grayson, not only because it was fantabulously awesome, but also because my latest string of read books (about five or so) have mostly been disappointing with most of them only rating, at most, a three. And right when I was losing faith in books that are very kick-ass and full of win, along comes Will Grayson, Will Grayson which, you guessed it, kicked-ass and was delightfully full of win.<br /><br />I loved every single character. I identified so much with Will Grayson number 1 because I was a bit like him in high school. I was outgoing and so not shy with my friends, but when it came to the mass population of my school, my general motto was \\"Shut up and keep your head down\\" (Of course, that was only in my freshman year of high school. After that my problem became not having the ability to shut up once unleashed. But that's okay I celebrate my flaws). I also loved Jane because, let's face it, there's a bit of a music snob in all of us. I was a little bit iffy about Will Grayson number 2 because at the beginning he had a little bit of the Holden Caulfield 'tude going on and I think Holden Caufield was full of crap, so therefore was annoyed by him. However, after a while, I did end up loving his character, too and feeling massively bad for him and his depression.<br /><br />While all these characters were amazing in their own right, I do have to say that Tiny Cooper was my favorite. He was just so wonderfully gay and I love wonderfully gay people. I find the out and the proud so great and courageous. And Tiny Cooper was all of these things with an amazing voice and with the ability to write the most amazing high school musical in the world of high school musicals (yes Tiny's musical beat out the crap that is Disney's High School Musical and beat out Glee, just a little bit). I loved the musical. Frankly, I want someone to recreate this musical JUST so I could crash it. But not crash it in the way that would ruin it, but crash it in the way that I would just jump in telling everyone that my name, too, is Will Grayson and I appreciate Tiny Cooper. I would be singing, clapping, and crying with the best of them.<br /><br />So, Will Grayson, Will Grayson? Full of all things that are fantabulous and awesome. It was also funny, poignant, and just heartwarming in the extreme. Amazing book all around.t I would just jump in telling everyone that my name, too, is Will Grayson and I appreciate Tiny Cooper.

B001AQO3QA|5.0|This is aliens at its best! Great picture, sounds amazing and I am even surprised to say this is how it was meant to be seen! with picture perfect clarity and the perks of the blu ray sharpness it almost makes it like seeing it for the first time, of course if you care about such  things, maybe the massive amount of extras would make you want to go the way of the blu ray, and if that also does not get you exited about it, well then i suppose the original extended versions on dvd will be enough. I have to admit that once I found out about this collection I waited very patiently for it to come out to own every alien movie (although I already owned alien and aliens special edition) but that is because the extras and the video quality really interested me. If it also interest you an absolute buy!
B003ZHQVJO|5.0|This album from Kid Rock shows how talented he truly is.  I have never purchased any of his previous albums but I listened to this online a little bit and I decided I would give it a try.  It is one of the best decisions I have ever made.  This album is full of outstanding lyrics and music.  Can't go wrong in buying this album.  Thank you Kid Rock!
0670022411|5.0|I usually don't leave reviews, but this book was amazing!  Very enthralling characters and the plot progressed beautifully.  The characters were very human (startling because they were all creatures) and evoked a wide range of emotions in the reader.  Absolute must read for fantasy/romance readers!!
B003EYVXXW|1.0|AGORA was not well presented. The characters were not fully developed, the story misrepresented historical facts, the camera work was not exceptional and the scenes were at times disjointed. The average viewer may find the setting and historical background confusing. I would not recommend this film.
159102594X|4.0|I liked this first book in the law trilogy. It introduces the major characters and keeps the reader interested. The characters are well defined and rich in scope. I would recommend this book to fantasy readers.
0525951652|5.0|This is the first KF novel I've read. What a surprise. I'm mad that I've been missing out all these years. A totally enjoyable read. The characters came to life and the story was captivating. I couldn't put it down. I'm a new fan and can't wait for more.
1599218011|1.0|I've been struggling with many health issues including Fibromyalgia and chronic pain and fatigue. I decided to try everything to get better. I really like Kris. She has a beautiful personality. However, after following verbatim her suggestions initially I felt good but slowly the fatigue got worse, followed by joint pain and weight gain. I gained about 12 lbs in three months eating lentil soup and soy and vegetables. I had to increase my antidepressant. After a while when things got so bad I went to a nutritionist who put me on a Paleo diet. I now eat healthy fats from pasture animals with my organic veggies. My fatigue is gone and the weight has fallen away. I was SO HUNGRY being vegan and couldn't think straight (and trust me I was eating a ton of quinoa and lentils and all that jazz). I am doing so well that I am off the antidepressant and I can no longer say I have fibromyalgia. I think this diet is dangerous and from my experience I've concluded that humans should eat meat. At least if I can beg you to eat eggs and fish. I think it's a nice positive book and she's an inspiring person, but be careful this isn't based on science, and if you are sick and looking to get better I just beg you to have an open mind. If you have fibromyalgia, or are even just hoping to lose weight, look into Paleo or Primal Blueprint, the paleo/primal diet the best thing that's ever happened to my health and wellness.
B002ZG994U|4.0|Although it was brought to my attention by my wife (the boss), that the whole Hannibal/Face Dynamic could have been better acted out.  But overall good picture.
B003HARV3Y|5.0|I bought this DVD for my great-grandson who has read all 5 books in the series.  But I enjoyed the movie too and have watched it several times.
B002ZG97RY|2.0|The blu-ray transfer was very poor and the way they filmed it was horrible. The plot is interesting, but the way it's filmed is annoying. No one in my house enjoyed it. Matt Daemon was good as usual as well as most of the other actors. I think this letdown falls on the director and editing.
B000IONJH4|1.0|it just makes the peanuts and sesame seeds visible.<br /><br />I'm reminded of the line from the wild bunch...<br /><br />\\"I don't care what you meant to do, its what you DID that I don't like\\"<br /><br />Many things are wrong and or just plain shoddy about this movie. Suffice to say it was forgettable when it came out, and I tried to watch it recently on hd (maybe I missed something the first time) but it seemed worse than I could have remembered.<br /><br />Too bad the Jodorowski Moebius version never came about
B000TCEU4Q|1.0|After a year and a half of using it, it started to fail. One of the sensors attached to the axis of the levers, started to send jittery signals to the point of becoming unusable. This is because of the terrible quality of the carbon disc potentiometers used as position sensors. I fixed it removing the bottom cover of the device and applying some silicon based lubricant to the potentiometers using a syringe. This fix made it work fine for only 10 days. I definitely recommend not to buy this short life disposable item. Saitek must do something about this issue. Good thing I didn't get the yoke and the rudder pedals.
B0000029DD|5.0|I love this cd, I play it in the car so much my kids are sick of it but I dont care he is such a wonderful singer and his music just makes you feel good!!!
B003CNQPNS|5.0|One of the best made for TV series with one of the shortest runs. It was great to be able to obtain the complete series of one of my favorite TV series of this era.  The thing that strikes me most now is that the show still is enjoyable to watch today even with all the filming and stunt advances used in today's productions.  It has withstood the test of time.  Street Hawk is a great series for fans of action films.
B0032Y8XH8|2.0|This is a group with a lot of potential and a powerful sound; but the songs I found to be a bit angry or depressing.  Maybe their next album will be better, if the song writer falls in love, instead of singing about how she done him wrong.
0316098337|5.0|The first couple chapters start out a little weird, and I almost thought of quitting, but I'm so glad I stuck with it. I was totally hooked and ended staying up way too late to finish. Very suspenseful, and a totally new premise for a book, I think.
B0042RUMJG|5.0|For anyone that likes Sting and his music, this is a must and a great live concert. Well worth the purchase.
0316098337|2.0|Unfortunately, the \\"voice\\" that the author gave to the child is inconsistent in its use of language; broken sentences and improper grammar interspersed with more sophisticated polysyllabic words that few if any real five-year-old boys would use. It was weird how babyish Jack was in the Room, and then in the second half of the book he is much more articulate. Very annoying. Also, why was everything Door, Rug, Skylight, Wardrobe. It was all just so aggravating.
0307346617|4.0|A fun, rollicking good time, among the best in its class. The author has a little too much fun with political stereotypes sometimes, but overall everything comes together rather well.
B000Q6GUW0|5.0|Having finished The Wire and BSG I had been looking for another television series to get into. A friend recommended Dexter. I must admit that the initial premise didn't strike me as something I would like - a show where a serial killer is the main character - how was that going to work?  Well it works quite well, though the writers do have to cheat a little - more on this in a minute.  At present I'm half way through Series one and I already know I'll be getting series 2 - why?    First, the writing is superb - American networks have been making some amazing series for the last decade or so - The Sopranos and The Wire being probably the best tv I have ever seen, there's also been Lost, BSG and Mad Men. One of the big advantages tv enjoys over standalone movies is that the writers can spend more time developing characters and filling in back-story to make it a richer viewing experience. If it's handled well it can be very rewarding and Dexter certainly shines in this department.    Second, acting. Superb throughout but obviously Michael C. Hall carries the show - if he can't make the main character work then the whole house of cards falls - he succeeds brilliantly making Dexter a perfect study of conflicted urges.    Third, plot. The first season story arch concerns the ice-truck killer but it is really also about introducing the character of Dexter. How do you make a serieal killer someone who you want to spend an hour each week with?  In my view, as mentioned above a certain amount aof cheating is required.    Cheat 1: You never actually see Dexter torturing and killing anyone - you see the lead up and the aftermath but not the act itself. Would we the viewer find Dexter such an endearing character if we saw his violent acts play out on the screen? I doubt it.    Cheat 2: Dexter's victims are portrayed as being the embodiment of pure evil. It's made clear to the viewer that anyone who Dexter kills deserves it. Reality is rarely so black and white.    Ultimately, Iguess that even though I recognise I'm being manipulated somewhat by the writers, I'm enjoying the show too much to care. I'd have no hesitation recommending Dexter. It's a smart funny, well written and superbly acted show that deserves the critical praise it's been getting on these pages.
B001GWK2MC|1.0|Used once and then took it to my daughters house and the second time we aired it up the exterior walls would deflait as fast as we aired them up.
0756404738|5.0|As a sequel to The Name of the Wind (2007), Patrick Rothfuss has woven a tale that feels shiny and new, while fitting to one's mind like favorite chair to one's bottom. From the first page of The Wise Man's Fear, I feel a welcome return to Kvothe's world, a meeting of old friend's - all of whom are waiting with bated breath to hear the legend continue.<br /><br />Kvothe's adventures around the University are familiar and a delight to read. All of the characters are back and with Kvothe have grown in every way. The real fun though doesn't begin until our narrator takes us off to explore the world. Fair Felurian. The Adem swordsmen. The mysterious Amyr. Life among nobility. The Chandrian. Denna.<br /><br />I can not do this book justice with my words...it's pure emotion. I laughed out loud, I nearly wept, my heart thundered in my ears and the cold leeched into my bones. I've never read another book that had such power over me, save The Name of the Wind. The author's prose is strong, sleek, and drives forward at a breakneck pace, but then slows, becoming ponderous, gentle and relaxed. It's astounding how much control this book has over the way I read it...often I felt like a boat on the ocean, the currents taking me where they will according to their own desires. All I could do was hang on.<br /><br />The Name of the Wind<br />The Wise Man's Fear<br /><br />These books are a must-read for any fan of literature. Comedic, tragic, languorous, intense. Everything in between. Enjoy the journey. I envy every single person who has yet to read this book - the first read-through was indescribably magical, and can never be experienced the same way again.
B004AHNIGM|5.0|I am definately enjoying this CD, it is a collection of old school blues types songs, definately not what i would have expected from Gregg, all though I saw him do one of the songs on tv and heard his interview were he discribes the type of music, so i knew what to expect.  I would recommend this CD, you might want to listen to a bit of it to make sure you are okay with this type of old music.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|For the last twelve years I have listened to so called Star Wars fans whine and cry about how Lucas \\"has ruined my childhood memories\\". All I have to say is if you don't like the new movies don't watch them. If you don't want to pay for the new releases and new material or the added scenes... then don't! Last time I checked I didn't think it was a requirement to be a Star Wars fan. Appreciate the story, appreciate that Lucas after 34 years is still getting fans. If nothing ever changed neither would the fan base the stories would die with the aging fans that are still trying to hold on to their youth for some strange reason. And for the record for all of you that think that Harrison Ford is just as upset as you about the state of the galaxy did you see the Crystal Skull? I rest my case!
B00127RAJY|5.0|I just bought this dvd a couple of days ago and let me tell you...Jillian works you! I'm not out of shape, I usually jog 4-5 times a week and she had me panting and sweating! Jillian is an awesome trainer..there's even a few times in the dvd where she mentions how she wishes how her abs were more defined and how she is not very flexible. It makes her more realistic to listen to because she's not just preaching at you!   Someone mentioned how negative she is...she's not at all! It's very similar to listening to a drill instructor yelling \\"DONT QUIT\\" and \\"YOU CAN DO BETTER\\".   After my workouts, I definitely feel the burn!     Although I LOVEEE this workout I DEFINITELY would NOT recommend this to those who are severely obese/out of shape or have bad knees or back. The workout is rough (even Level 1!!) and I can't imagine someone who has joint problems even attempting this (lots of jumping jacks, squats, jumping in place) or someone who is severely over weight being able to do this.     If you do get this don't be discouraged!! I couldn't do a push up at first (which is in this dvd) but I just did my best (even if I couldn't keep up with Jillian) and every day I do the workout, I get better and better at it!!

I can't wait to get to the dieting part so I can  start. I do like the realness of this book it keeps my  interest.I would recomend it to others who are looking to change their life and  loose weight and or gain muscle and get healthy. It would be even more awsome if it was like one of those talking books lol.                                                                  me in mass
B001QWBM62|4.0|My old Marantz PMD600 lost its ability to run on batteries just as I was heading overseas, so I bought this unit in a hurry and in a leap of faith, and have been very pleasantly surprised.  The balance between the mikes and the processors is obviously a key element in the sound quality, and in the unit's ability to handle peaks, like church bells, is very good indeed. I have been running it on stamina mode (??) since I got it and have made several hours of recording without budging the battery meter; the Marantz eats four AA batteries much faster than the H4n does with its two.   On the caution side, the unit is hardly tiny - about the size of a small brick, and more than you can comfortably carry in, say, a shirt pocket.      So the $450 Marantz is on the fritz after five years; let's see how the Zoom holds up.
B004BBDHEK|5.0|After waiting for so many years for a new album,I'd say: He did it again!   I loved this new album. Eletronic sounds and some lyrics give a totally refreshing mood to the listener.   But even with so many surprises, we can still identify in each song the \\"pure\\" Yanni music.  Fans from all over the world will be able to enjoy this new album and for sure add to their favorite Yanni's collection.  [...]
B0041KKYBA|5.0|When I saw \\"Inside Job\\" I was seething and my stomach started turning with fear, because it made one thing perfectly clear: nobody has truly learned anything and the next crisis is just ahead and it will be even worse. I sort of knew all this, but it was depressing to see that my own personal estimation was right.    The documentary is well researched, well structured and unlike the documentaries by Michael Moore (which have also its merits) tries to stick mostly to the facts which is really more then enough to make anybody angry.  I thought I had a pretty good idea of what had been going on in 2008 and before, but this documentary showed me that things are a lot more worse. The Oscar for it was very well deserved and I honestly hope that more people will see it. I hope that some television channels will air it at some point for free, because this documentary needs to be watched. The way things are I am expecting a second part to this documentary and three more years or so.

B000002G30|5.0|Back in the early 2000's, Monster Magnet was pretty much a band that I overlooked. Out of all of their songs, \\"Powertrip,\\" \\"Look To Your Orb for the Warning,\\" and \\"Heads Explode\\" were the only ones that kept me engaged. Now, I delved deeper into their music, and immediately I was hooked. Monster Magnet has become one of my all-time favorite bands (alongside Deep Purple, Korn, Lynyrd Skynyrd, and Mad at Gravity). So far, I've become a satisfied listener with 4-Way Diablo, Monolithic Baby, and Powertrip. Dopes to Infinity is close to perfection. The music is just right for my ears. \\"Look To Your Orb For the Warning\\" is my top favorite from this album (not because of The Matrix, trust me). \\"Dopes to Infinity\\" is a fantastic introduction to the album, and \\"Negasonic Teenage Warhead\\" deserves to be a single. From \\"All Friends and Kingdom Come,\\" straight to \\"Vertigo,\\" it's a completely satisfying experience.<br /><br />It's too bad that Monster Magnet isn't very famous around the world. Looks like the music only applies to a specific taste. Despite that, I'm glad that I've explored the band's musical world. So now I can fully enjoy their music anytime.<br /><br />Grade: 10/10<br /><br />Also from Monster Magnet<br /><br />Powertrip (10/10) [[ASIN:B000007QDK Powertrip]]<br />Monolithic Baby!

B000G6R7B8|5.0|I love this watch.  I have been looking for just the right watch for the last 4 years, I even bought a Victorinox for more than twice the price, that I like, not love.  You get more than you pay for, though it is an automatic and you will gain or loose some time.  Mine seems to be .01 sec fast... but in reality, I'm not a super spy, and I have a cell phone, so maybe once every week or two I set it back a min as needed.  If you really wanted you could take it to a trusted jeweler and have it \\"tuned up\\".  But for the price, the movement is beautiful and the clear backing is mezmorizing (sorry 'bout my spelling).  The styling is perfect, has an old school feel with modern \\"slickness\\", as my father would say.  The face is smaller, which was a selling point for me... there seems to be a big watch trend, I hate that.  I wear my watch 24hrs/day 7 days a week (I do take it off to take a shower though), the size of this face is perfect; form, style and function.  The only thing that I did to it was replace the band, I love the NATO style bands, the fit can be tailored perfectly.  I LOVE THIS WATCH, and though I am drunk on this fabulous time piece at the moment, of course, I see myself wearing it for many years to come (the last watch I had was a timex and I wore it for 5  years till the battery died).    P.S.  I know that 5 stars is  almost cleche' but I feel that it is appropriate here.
B004INNRFK|5.0|I was highly entertained with David Foster's previous \\"Hitman\\" production. In \\"Hitman Returns,\\" he provides us with another opportunity to marvel at his genius. With a wide variety of musicians and songs (although not all of the songs performed are Foster's), I am more impressed with this program than the last. My only complaint is that the CD only includes a minimal amount of music performed on the DVD.
B00070DK1E|4.0|I am glad one of the other reviewers indicated that you do not have to like every song on a Tull album. I have found that with several of his efforts but the songs that do hit make the album a classic. Steel Monkey as far as I am concerned is a blow you away fast paced rocker. Barre does some amazing technical work on an electric guitar and this song really shows it. By the way his contribution on Farm on the Freeway is also spectacular. When I first heard that song I almost thought his electric guitar was acoustic at the start of the song. He is incredible and do not believe otherwise!    Jumpstart starts out cool but it ventures all over the place and as far as I am concerned has a 7/10 rating at best. And lastly, I see at least one reviewer gets a real charge out of Budapest and the rest of the album but I just dont see it. I would agree however the Steel Monkey and Farm on the Freeway could knock Metallica out of the ring just by themselves.     It is OK Tull fans, you can pick certain songs on Tull albums to like. I rather think Tull would even expect that.
B0016ITO98|5.0|This is a perfect Christmas movie to watch with the family. My kids will set and watch the whole movie, even the black and white version. I love it and highly recommend it to anyone who hasnt seen it before! It will become an instant family favorite.
B00026W82U|3.0|RIOT ON AN EMPTY STREET, the second album from the Kings of Convenience, keeps the quiet, folksy beauty to the music: the acoustic guitar and vocal harmonies blend seamlessly into one. But despite solid efforts like \\"Homesick\\" and \\"Surprise Ice,\\" it doesn't seem quite as magical as their debut QUIET IS THE NEW LOUD. After a few repeated listens, I figured out why: the songs are so pretty and nice that they don't sound new. \\"Cayman Islands,\\" for being about an exotic locale, sounds like it could have come off of their first album; the same goes for \\"Stay Out of Trouble\\" and \\"Gold in the Air of Summer.\\" I suppose Erland Oye's solo album, with its mix of folk and electronics, has somewhat spoiled me. The female vocals on \\"Know-How\\" and \\"The Build Up\\" start to correct this, but not quite enough. Elsewhere, \\"Love Is No Big Truth\\" has a disco beat that seems at odds with the rest of the song (it makes a little more sense of \\"I'd Rather Dance With You,\\" though, even if the lyrics are a bit silly). Good? Sure, but not as strong as QUIET IS THE NEW LOUD.
0525951652|5.0|This book was recommended by a very good friend who suggested that I read Pillars of the Earth by the same author. After reading it and then the next book I was hooked. I ordered Fall of Giants and was very pleased with every aspect of the book. The three books of his that I have read have all averaged around 950 to 1000 pages so he has to keep you entertained. Once again a very good read.

B003EY7IRC|2.0|SPOILERS                  After following the series this long, I was disappointed. Meandering and too many WTF moments. I flipped many pages and even then it took me two weeks to read it, when normally I would take a vacation day to read the entire previous ones. I Felt robbed about still not knowing more about Barrons and will be extra po'ed if this moves another series.  And I just could NOT buy  characters whom I really enjoyed from the Highlander series in their roles, didn't seem to fit into FEVER genre. It was especially lame when the entire families were brought to live at the clubs. So much to complain about that then was even a let down. Even his reason for wanting the book was a little too cliche.     Very disappointed, but happy i downloaded rather than buying the HC
0061353248|4.0|Dan Ariely, the James B. Duke Professor of Psychology and Behavioral Economics at Duke University, writes about \\"the hidden forces that shape our decisions\\" in Predictably Irrational. This book is not as diverse as some of the other behavioral economics books out there, but Ariely makes up for breadth with depth. Many of the subjects tackled are explored in detail.<br />Ariely writes about how he first became interested in the field of economics. You can skip the introduction to most economics book, but Ariely's story is worth reading. Ariely received third degree burns on over 70% of his body as an eighteen year old. His experiences in the hospital, including three years of recovery and therapy, convinced him to study what shapes our decisions.<br /><br />For the most part, the subjects Ariely tackles will keep your interest. Some of the broader financial subjects, like supply and demand, could have been tightened. The information is good but too much time is spent explaining the experiments used to prove it.<br /><br />Ariely spends a lot of his time in the more traditional economics arena, albeit with examples that make the subject interesting to anyone. Unfortunately for the reader, the most fascinating subjects are also the shortest. There are at least two chapters that I will refer to in the future, one on the influence of arousal and the other on the context of our character.<br /><br />In Chapter Six, Ariely tackles arousal. Ariely concludes that we make bad decisions when we are controlled by lust. Not just bad decisions either . . . he shows how right and wrong become very gray when we are trapped in temptation. He offers two solutions, but focuses in on the second. He concludes that the best way to avoid bad decisions is to avoid putting ourselves in that situation. Some parents have decided that once they teach their kids to say \\"no\\" that their job is done. This book easily disproves that theory . . . it is often the parents job to say \\"no\\" so their children will be protected from uncontrollable situations.<br /><br />Another great chapter covered the influence of the Ten Commandments on cheating. Long story short, reflecting on any part of the Ten Commandments was enough to stop cheating. Ariely goes on to test the same with different honor codes and has similar results. The results seemed to have surprised the experimenters. Right and wrong prove to be powerful influencers . . . there is much to reflect on here.<br /><br />Books like this are important for people of all walks of life to read. This book is recommended for anyone who is interested in why we behave the way we do.uncontrollable situations.    Another great chapter covered the influence of the Ten Commandments on cheating.

0596009208|5.0|I am currently enrolled in  a beginning Java course in college. The textbook was a PDF that I printed out using their ink and paper, 900 pages! It was rated on Amazon as the worst textbook and I really agree. Head First Java was written so that I could understand the concepts in plain English and they made it fun to read. I have NO programming knowledge and this book has been my go to reference book for my weekly assignments. Great job and well worth the money!
0142410705|4.0|This was my first John Green novel and I had high expectations.  I'm not exactly sure why, maybe because of his personality on his vlogs?  I don't know, but in the beginning I felt a bit disappointed.  It felt like it moved a little slow.  It was a tad bit boring.  But I kept reading and the book completely redeemed itself!  It wasn't long until I was laughing hysterically and sharing pieces with my husband (who actually laughed, and NEVER laughs at books when I read pieces to him).<br />I knew, just knew, that John Green had to be a pro at creating a unique characters, and he totally was!  Colin reminded me of Sheldon from The Big Bang Theory.  Not as extreme, and much more like-able, but still similar in ways.  And I loved him!  He was that great character that really jumps out at you.  And his friend, Hassan was the same way.  Between the two of them there were plenty of laughs.  Hassan was more of a funny guy, and Colin definitely was not, but in all his seriousness he still said some funny things.<br />The story line is different because the two take off on a road trip and end up in a tiny town in Tennessee and that's where almost the entire story takes place.  They end up staying and they both kind of 'find themselves' there.<br />This book was overall quite good, but I really had to push myself to stick with it in the beginning.  So that's just a warning, hang in there if your not feeling it, the second half is WAY better then the first!<br /><br />[...]
B003YFIUW8|5.0|This book was an amazing read. It took a little getting used to reading how the book was written, from the perspective of a 5 year old, but once I got going I could not put it down. There was one part in the book when I was sitting on edge, I was ridiculously nervous for the characters. This book is a must read!

B00155GDXC|4.0|Initially, the form of The Reluctant Fundamentalist by Mohsin Hamid seems forced. Surely it will restrict what the author can achieve. By the end, however, the form has become a crucial part of the plot. The turnabout then works very well indeed.<br /><br />Changez has returned to Pakistan from the USA, where he both studied and worked. He is in conversation with a foreign visitor to his country. Apparently they are sitting in a caf&eacute;. The visitor is probably an American but, surprisingly, the conversation is entirely one-sided. Basically, Changez tells his life story, eventually relating in detail the conspiring events that led him to his current preoccupations and status.<br /><br />He was the child of an upper class family in Lahore. He was a bright thing from the start and when the time was right a place at Princeton beckoned. He excelled and was offered a job with a business consulting group, where he learned much more than merely contemporary jargon. He also fell head over heels in love with an American girl, herself a gifted student with a desire to write. She wanted to tell stories, beginning perhaps with one featuring herself and describing her former boyfriend's struggle with terminal illness. Initially at least she seems newly besotted with her new Pakistani friend, with Changez's unexpected and wholly foreign politeness, good manners and dress sense all creating favourable impressions.<br /><br />The silent listener absorbs all this without comment as he and Changez await their food in a Lahore restaurant. Everything looks rosy for our graduate and the listening tourist seems to respond to the raconteur's story. The narrator then begins to describe a new era, an era that began on September 11 2001 and the destruction of the World Trade Center in New York. The Reluctant Fundamentalist's tone changes abruptly as the world and the individual's place in it seem to need reinterpretation. As things turn out, Changez returns to Pakistan, where he takes up teaching. And still our listener absorbs the story without response.<br /><br />The book's denouement is both surprising and satisfying. The form that has seemed to be a handicap suddenly contributes to the experience. We are left with an enigmatic, open ending where surely something will happen. Mohsin Hamid perhaps allows each of us to fill in some blanks.<br /><br />Mohsin Hamid's The Reluctant Fundamentalist is quite a short book. It possibly just exceeds the novella form. But in a succinct and sophisticated way it addresses and comments on some complex issues. Its methods are both sympathetic and involving. Its efforts convince the reader without being didactic. It is thus a significant achievement.ner absorbs the story without response.    The book's denouement is both surprising and satisfying.

B000SGGUWS|5.0|Pretty Little Liars is a grea show.  If you want to know what happenes the show is better than the book.  The reason the show is better, because it more decriptive.  Also, the book is good, but it is harder to get a good picture in your head.  So if you want you wantto know why I am saying that the show is better than the book is I am a teen and I prefer the show better.
B004GNYGTI|5.0|\\"SALT\\" was the most exciting movie I have seen in a while. I am definitely a movie buff, but lately I have been disappointed with recent films. Then I watched Salt, and I was blown away. I was thrilled that the language was PG first of all. And Angelina Jolie's performance was absolutely stunning. I love the fact that she does her own stunts. My attention was kept throughout the entire film, and I was on the edge of my seat wondering what was going to happen next. I can usually predict pretty much how things are going to turn out, but with Salt, I was surprised at every turn. I would recommend this movie to anyone, even if they aren't into action/thrillers! I give it a TEN!
B004L3AQFG|5.0|An emotionally gripping tale of survival. Probably the only movie that has one actor in it that is entertaining. considering that almost all the movie takes place in one spot James Franco grips you in his performance, Danny Boyle is amazing directing also taking that one spot in the canyon and making it come alive. Amazing movie.. A must see for EVERYONE
0061706620|5.0|I loved this book.  It was like getting in the head of John Winchester.  He tells you about his life, his children and hunting.  I could not put it down.  It was great!
0061726826|5.0|From beginning to start, this book had me sucked into the world in which Lena and Alex live. It's suspenseful, heartbreaking, and so good that I wanted to reread it as soon as I finished. Lena is such a relatable character that she comes to life almost instantly. And Alex? Every girl who reads this book will swoon over him. If you haven't read this, read it, love it, read it again.
B004LSO6YI|1.0|As one reviewer mentioned, this was shot in 12 days.  Believe me, this is no lesbian Scorcese.  It feels not only like it was shot in that amount of time but that watching takes that long too.  Ponderous, exhausting, cliche-ridden, heavy-handed.  I could go on and on and I really don't like giving a bad review to a heart-felt project like this.  But if you have an IQ over 12, it's really rough going.  Buyer beware unless you're looking for a really bad camp classic.
B002HJ9PTO|5.0|This mic works extremely well for our purposes.  It is lightweight (hardly noticeable) and the belt clip makes it easier to move about with.  The recording quality we get on the camera using this is excellent.
B002VPE1AW|2.0|As so many have stated before on here, this is a stunning movie. Thats where it ended for me. Im just amazed how gullible so many people were to this mess. It was too long and it felt like a mish mash of so many other films. Cameron comes off as a serious hack. He should have spent a little more time on the screenplay/story itself. The writing was bland, boring and quite amateur. I found myself even cringing at the dialogue especially Sigourney Weaver's. Best way to describe Avatar- Its like a very pretty girl with rotten teeth and bad gas.....
1572816112|5.0|This is far and away one of the most exciting decks I have used. Not for the faint hearted, and great for reading yang natured souls. The deck does require that the user understand the origin of the meaning of Tarot, as traditional visual clues are hard to find.<br /><br />This is a very powerful deck for the professional reader. The card stock is sturdy, the finish is easy to handle, and they shuffle well.  Easily a collector's item for those who love exotic cards. I will write an in depth review in the near future.
B002ZG980U|4.0|One of the things that attracts some people to science fiction (and repels others) is that its stories are usually based on \\"WHAT IF--?\\" premises that are NOT parts of our \\"normal reality.\\" Much early \\"sci-fi\\" or \\"SF\\" was disparaged as crap because the premises overwhelmed both the story arcs and the characters--and the writing also was often very poor. In recent decades, a better balance has been found by hundreds of authors and dozens film makers, and both the TERMINATOR series and ALIEN series, for instance, are now highly respected classics.<br /><br />INCEPTION, I felt, is better than average but has at least three weaknesses--no, make that four--no, five. For one thing, the story arc is trite and its ending derivative (think Terry Gilliam's BRAZIL, 1985). For another, at its own \\"inception\\" we viewers are given material that coyly/pseudo-artfully prefigures some ending scenes but does not logically hold up (Ken Watanabe as an old man in BOTH spots). Thirdly, very often the exposition of the \\"What If--?\\" is clunkier than 20 speed bumps in a new housing development--the action grinds to a halt while one \\"expert\\" explains some new aspect of Dream Management 101 to another \\"expert,\\" just so we viewers can eavesdrop and become informed. Fourthly, we really are NOT made to care much either way about the success or failure of the \\"mission\\" (a kind of caper involving a sub-category of industrial espionage) NOR about the happiness or misery of the main character, a somewhat charmless widower who wants to live with his young children (played by Leonardo DiCaprio). And the back-stories of the other characters are non-existent, so of course we don't care either way about them. And fifthly, the whole notion of creating the \\"inception\\" of an idea in a business rival's head rests on a shakier foundation than trickle-down economics: any kernel of an idea put into anyone's brain can sprout and grow in any of 57-million directions--NOT just the one narrow direction that is desired by the paymaster (played by Ken Watanabe).<br /><br />On the PLUS side--this film has fast-action and good CGI special effects in many places. It IS a decent mind-game with four levels of action that flash round-&-round in kaleidoscopic fashion--and then go to a fifth level. It IS way more mature in its psychology than James Cameron's AVATAR; it makes much more sense than the MATRIX series; and it's far, far, FAR superior in every respect to M. Night Shyamalan's THE LAST AIRBENDER.<br /><br />But I would still sooner rewatch STRANGER THAN FICTION (Will Ferrell, Helen Mirren, Dustin Hoffman). The only reason I put INCEPTION back into my DVD player the next day and sped past scene after scene to the end again--was to satisfy my curiosity--as to how LONG it ran. SPOILER ALERT: the version I watched ran 2:20:47--which is more than I'd have cared to sit in a theater, especially if I had bought a large cola.he paymaster (played by Ken Watanabe).

0061537969|5.0|I read fiction constantly - about a novel a week - and I cannot remember the last time I was so blown away by a book.<br /><br />It's funny, when I first picked it up, I wasn't sure I'd like it. A story by a dog? A reference to \\"Marley and Me\\" on the jacket copy? I was on the fence and it was really only when I read the first few pages that I realized I was hooked and had to continue reading.<br /><br />The voice of the dog was fantastic and believable, the characters were well-drawn and multidimensional, the story itself riveting and moving. I actually cried reading it. Several times I put it down in my lap and just said, \\"Wow\\". A truly great piece of literature changes the way you see the world. This book does that so beautifully, you feel like you've lived within it, been through the experience yourself.<br /><br />A MAZ ZING!!!!!
B002WYJHBA|5.0|Pleasantville may be one of the most underrated movies of all time.  Superbly acted, beautifully directed, scored, and executed, no movie depicts the socialization of \\"family values\\", the American Dream, and gender roles in such an exciting, fantastical way.  Of course, it goes on to touch base with other hot issues like racism and generation gap, and there it arguably  starts to lose its potency, but no matter who you are or what issue you're interested in, there's something to take away from the powerful imagery and storyline that debunks the \\"ideal life\\" depiction that is shoved down American throats via 1950's television.<br /><br />Because color plays such a crucial role in the success of this film, Pleasantville is unsurprisingly a must-own Blu Ray.  I mean, the entire movie is based on suddenly seeing the world in high definition color - it's like a BD fanatic's fantasy.  It's also obvious the filmmakers were excited about releasing the film in HD because the transfer appeared to be taken at least somewhat seriously.  I won't say it's the greatest, most stunning transfer I've ever seen, but it's certainly powerful enough that you FEEL the 1080p working its magic.  Much of the movie is in black and white, but still grays are exquisitely decipherable, whites are bright and crisp, and darks are appropriately deep and textured.  When color does start to appear it does so with a splash, crash, and bang.  Reds are SO rich and greens appear alive.  Blue is vast and yellow is is particularly captivating.  The full experience of Pleasantville practically DEMANDS Blu Ray technology.  It's hard to imagine I ever watched this movie on a standard DVD, you miss so much of the magic and power a single color can have when you see it in standard definition.<br /><br />My overall opinion of the Blu Ray, having not bothered watching any special features (though there are some interesting ones, including audio commentaries), is that it is simply a must-own.  I'm sure someday down the road there will be a 20th anniversary edition or something that will have a slightly better transfer, but I don't think it's worth waiting for.  I consider myself a bit of a Blu Ray snob (I refuse to watch DVDs anymore) and it would be hard to imagine seeing the movie in much better clarity.  It looks gorgeous, the aspect ratio is 1:85:1 which means the picture will fill the entire (wide)screen, the audio is lossless and impressive, and most importantly this Type of movie is just MEANT for BD.  To watch it any other way would be a crime.will be a 20th anniversary edition or something that will have a slightly better transfer, but I don't think it's worth waiting for.

B001EN71CW|5.0|Before buying the Blu-ray set of this series, I had read some negative reviews on Amazon (as well as some positive ones). I'd never seen the show before picking up this set, although my brother owns the DVDs. Comparing the two, the Blu-ray set is greatly improved over the standard definition set.    Detail is generally real high with a lot of appropriate and natural film grain. The series was shot on 35mm film, so I'd expect it to have a filmic appearance. In this regard, it does not disappoint.    CGI effects shots don't look as good, as I suspect due to the age of the show that they were done in a much lower resolution and then upscaled for HD. They don't look great, but they don't hamper the enjoyment either. The only way to make them look any better would be to redo them, and I doubt Fox cares enough to put money toward such an endeavor.    If you have the DVD set but like hi-def detail and film-like quality, I'd say it's worth the upgrade. It definitely won't disappoint.    The show itself? I'm only four episodes in, but I'm enjoying it immensely! I dig westerns and I dig sci-fi. Or rather, I should say I dig \\"alternative\\" sci-fi. What the hell that means, I'm not entirely sure, but I'll take a show like \\"Farscape\\" over a staple like \\"Star Trek\\" any day.
B003EY7IRC|5.0|This series has been one fantastic book after another. I read a lot of good books by good authors and even Monings Highlander books were good, but this series was beyond expectation. She threw me through so many loops trying to figure things out but it was worth every agonizing truth learned to get to the end. There were some unanswered questions still at the end, but she intended that. It was well worth buying the harcovers for a collection.
B004EBT5CU|5.0|I had been waiting for this album and it has certainly has been worth the wait! Adele is back with some of the most beautiful melodies, intriguing and soul stirring lyrics and an absolutely STELLAR voice! Track, after track the music on 21 pulls you in, paints a picture and takes control your heart and ears as the music engulfs you. This album is a brilliant tribute to the influences of Blues, Country, Rock, and Soul! I am eagerly anticipating being there at her live performance when her tour hits the Metro NY area this coming summer. Bravo Adele! BRAVO!
0385342039|4.0|I read the first \\"Shopaholic\\" novel and loathed it with every fiber of my being.  I can't believe the same author responsible for inflicting that atrocity on the world could also write a book that I enjoyed so much. \\"Twenties Girl\\" asks you to accept the premise that a girl is hanging out with the ghost of her dead aunt, so you really can't start looking for plot holes - just go with it, you will definitely be entertained. I have read a few reviews that noted the book was too long, but I couldn't disagree more - I read it in a few days, and was sad when I was finished.  I laughed out loud quite a few times, and couldn't wait to see what happened next.  The main character is kind of a ditz but she's likeable, the mystery is interesting and the solution is satisfying (although I would have done something different regarding the ultimate fate of the necklace). There is also a cute romance.  This is a perfect beach book, or somthing fun to read as a \\"palate cleanser\\" in between heavier novels.  Enjoy!
B002ZG999U|3.0|Good movie but it felt about 20 minutes too long. Maybe I'm just older now but all the noise started to get old also. Don't get me wrong - it is worth watching you're a fan of the genre or the actors but I would watch half one night and the other half the next.
B004AKCMD4|5.0|This is a great movie for all ages. Great graphics great storyline and this with a 46 inch Samsung LCD and surround sound creates a great movie.
B0034G4P7G|2.0|Let's face it, Facebook is not exactly the most dramatic of subject matters. Watching drunk college students typing frantically on keyboards may be your idea of a dramatic narrative - if it is this is for you. Curiously, the film looks and feels just like Zodiac - a crime film about a serial murderer. The scenes are drenched in somber, mysterious shadows as though vampires are afoot. The pasty faced fools who have somehow become the hero ideals of our generation are seen leaping about with Oriental 'hos of one type or another, while \\"the adults\\" all appear bored out of their mind. Most strange of all is the music, which is often so loud (obviously to make up for the lack of drama) that is actually drowns out the dialogue! A bizarre and totally useless film that tells us nothing about anything. Even the title is a bore. \\"Social Networking\\"? What does that mean? Is that what the film is about? I don't see much socializing in this film.
0439023521|5.0|I'm not one for writing long reviews.  I am however an avid reader at about 2-3 books a month.  However I haven't read a book in a single sitting in many years.  I cannot wait to get the second book.  I hooked me straight from the start.  Amazing writing, engrossing story characters you fall in love with.  You will not be sorry.<br /><br />Update...After reading the last word on the last page of the 3rd and final book, I lingered there not wanting to close the book as I felt I was saying goodbye to some real friends.  Collins has written a series so engrossing I am sorry to see it end. I honestly feel emotional about saying goodbye to this characters.

B002T921AC|5.0|Very talented kid. He is the only solo artist in the World (since Beatles, but they are a band) to start out with an album that topped the charts! He is also the only artist that got popular through the Internet!    Justin can play 4 different instruments (never had any lessons), rap, dance and sing at the same time with perfect quality!    My favorite song is personally \\"One time\\", Justin's smooth soothing light voice reminded me of the King of Pop (of the Jackson 5).    Not only he is a good singer but also a beautiful person - His personality, his smile, his face, his hair is flawless!     After seeing his movie \\"Never say Never\\", my respect for him only increased, he is very honest and dedicated to his fans, something I have not seen in others artists.    Justin Bieber = PURE BEAUTY + INSANE TALENT!    Totally recommended!

B0037AGASG|5.0|This second part Justin takes it to a whole new level!    The songs \\"Baby\\", \\"Somebody to love\\" \\"Never let you go\\" are my most favorite songs.    Flawless voice, flawless looks. His light voice has a \\"soothing\\" feel that even makes guys weep.
074322454X|5.0|This book goes hand in hand with the HBO mini series \\"Band of Brothers\\".  It also fills in the blanks that HBO didn't include in the mini series.  This is another well-written Ambrose book.
B004LGPBYY|3.0|I actually did not know this album was coming out, so I didn't hesitate to buy it-being an Oasis fan.  Though I new this new band wasn't Oasis, I listened with without judgemental ears.    The songs are very fresh, and the music overall has a clean quality to it-the guitars kinda jaggle a bit without the heaviness and it almost seemed like Noel was missing...and he was I reminded myself cos it wasn't Oasis. The songwriting wasn't very complex, or angst but I do like the four letter word as the opener cos it's a good track to let the gates flow-very oasis like.  One previous review made the comment that these are basically ex back up musicians (with exeption of Liam)in a new band trying to be lead musicians...and I agree.     In my opinion the songs do lack the complexity, hooks and edge that an experienced band leader may bring to a group, but overall it is a decent effort, and if they keep at it should get better. I really do appreciate that this lp had 13 songs, so they did not lack in ideas and each song was really unique-though at times the songs seemed to me more like very good demos-something was missing still, maybe a hook or a definitive sounding solo.    Overall I give this record a 3 of 5, but an 8 of 10 for effort.

B000FC1KBG|5.0|In love with this lady.  I did her steps with my first child then for some reason totally forgot about them with my second, until he wasn't sleeping or napping--just screaming all day and night.  I grabbed this book reread it in one day and now my son is completely napping and sleeping on his own.  Her key is putting them down to sleep at the \\"right\\" time before you miss your window-boy does it work!  I have read numerous other books this go around, but again, this is the only method that works for us!
B003PIUBZS|5.0|Enjoyed it very much. Originaly watched it on Starz and liked it so well I knew I had to own it . Have watched it over and over. Everyone I know who has watched it loved it. It never grows old.
030745455X|5.0|WOW!  This book really does blow the first one out of the water.  So good I was up all hours of the night finishing it (on a work night, no less).  Buy it -You won't be disappointed!
0670022411|5.0|I'm not sure as to why there are bad reviews here, but if you have a true love for mystery, romance, fantasy and history as I do, this book had it all! Could not put this book down and I'm so hanging on edge for the second book! I became immersed in Matthew and Diana's life and where they where going next in there adventure! I highly recommend this book!!! I never thought anything could make me say BETTER THAN TWILIGHT, but this has done it for me! Love this story and hope the author doesn't keep me hanging for long ! Highly anticipating next book! I love the added history in this novel!
B000FBFN1U|1.0|I own this whole series (or what there is of it so far) and I LOVE it.      HOWEVER:  the kindle editions of ASOS and AFFC DO NOT INCLUDE CHAPTER BREAKS!  This is just plain stupid.  The first two books include chapter breaks.  If you forgot someone's name or wanted to reread a section it was pretty easy to skip chapters.  No can do with the last two.  1200 pages of text and no way to jump ahead or back other than page by page.  IT'S AWFUL.    Buy the paperback.
0316174483|5.0|This was such a great book for my kids! Fun, easy activity with adorable results that can be kept as keepsakes of the kids little fingerprints!  We will be using it for ideas for fingerprint crafts for years to come.
B000U0F7RG|5.0|I have enjoyed the Gilmore Girls and like the option of having it close at hand.  The packaging isn't the best, but the price versus the single years is better.  The \\"barbie doll box\\" affair is hard to store, too.  But the value is great.  Enjoying!
B001B7CNXI|5.0|The packaging was in great shape.  I really don't like to pay extra for shipping so I always select the standard or whatever is free, but this order was shopped promptly.  I appreciate that.
B001FB55LW|4.0|This review is simply about the product purchased directly from Amazon and not about the movie itself.    The product title that I am reviewing is: \\"Yes Man (Two-Disc Special Edition)\\" and the current image of the DVD cover states that this is a \\"Two-Disc Digital Copy Special Edition\\". This however, is incorrect. This product only contains one disc and no longer features the second disc, containing a digital copy. According to the back cover image, the second disc was only available through \\"April 06, 2010\\". Personally, I don't really care about having the digital copy, but I thought future Amazon customers should be aware.
B004856SQ8|5.0|I can appreciate prompt and efficient service.  The packaging was perfect and I received it in a timely manner.
B0041KKYDI|4.0|After seeing the film in theatres twice, I decided to order (directly from Amazon) this excellent (in my opinion) film by Danny Boyle. While, as with any film, I mostly bought it for the main feature, I was also interested in the background of the film and was looking forward to watching the Special Features listed as part of the product description:<br /><br />\\"- Feature Commentary by Director/Co-Screenwriter Danny Boyle, Producer Christian Colson and Co-Screenwriter Simon Beaufoy<br />- Deleted Scenes<br />- Search & Rescue: Actual events that aided the search and rescue of Aron Ralston<br />- 127 Hours: An Extraordinary View - A unique collaboration between the director and actor<br />- Disc 2: Digital Copy\\"<br /><br />However, the single disc I received only contained the commentary and deleted scenes. Neither of the featurettes were on the disc and there was no second disc containing the digital copy. After speaking with an Amazon representative and researching this a little bit, I discovered that these features are only a part of the Blu-Ray product. So, if you're into Blu-Ray (I am not, but that's a whole other story), then you will get everything you ordered. Unfortunately, the DVD comes up short, at least based on Amazon's description of it. Needless to say, I was a bit disappointed with the product I received.
B0036TGSIK|5.0|This was a Birthday gift.  I had a difficult time finding it at a reasonable price in the stores.  This gift was last minute, and considered extra.  I didn't want to pay too much extra.  Well to make a long story short (too late!), I found it on Amazon and received it on time for the birthday, in perfect condition.  I can appreciate this extra care and effort taken to have my item delivered quickly.
B000KX0IOA|4.0|I used this to supplement a unit I teach to my Sophomores. It was definitely worth the purchase. The students were able to see and learn more about India's partition from Gandhi's perspective.
B002ZG9774|5.0|There aren't many musicals anymore. All of the reviews I read on this film were crap. After seeing it, which is why I pre-ordered it, I cannot at all understand the critics' attack on this great movie in any way. There's really nothing bad I can say. I knew I was going to see a musical. Music is all great. Sure it's a \\"small town girl goes to the big city and makes it big\\" story; but, with its own twist, and a cool surprise happy ending. It is extremely enjoyable and so fun. Cher, Christina, Stanley, Cam, Kristin, Julianne, all did an awesome job in this film. It reminds me of when I was way younger and went to the movies and came out feeling like I had a really great time and escaped from the world for a couple of hours. Scenery was beautiful, costumes, music. It was a great time and I'm glad we have our own at home to pop in and watch now and then and share with friends. There are some great one liners from all the characters. Cher's songs, especially the Golden Globe winner were awesome and Christina singing the Etta James tunes and the ones she contributed rocked. So, if you want to see a great musical with ear and eye candy and fun for the heart & soul, be sure and see it.
B003UGLCIA|5.0|I have loved this movie from the first time I saw it and I was only twelve. The extended version makes it so much more creepy.  No other compares.
B003L20ID8|4.0|Considering all the garbage movie critics have to sit through in a year, it's pretty amazing when a film that's smarter than most hits theaters and makes a bit of an impact. Independent films are one thing, but major ones released by bigger studios are even a bigger deal when this occurs. I think that's one of the reasons Inception was so great. Creativity and intelligence are two things that are usually lacking from blockbusters. The Adjustment Bureau is a film that has a bit more to it than you're probably expecting. Based on \\"The Adjustment Group,\\" a short story by Philip K. Dick (Blade Runner, Total Recall, Minority Report), The Adjustment Bureau has probably already caught your attention either because you're a fan of Dick's work and/or the movies that were adapted from it.<br /><br />The film's charm is definitely in its explanation for things. The way the bureau works and how they function is a wonder in itself. You'll never look at a door or a man wearing a hat the same way again after viewing the film. Perhaps the most interesting is Thompson's explanation of how events in history like The Great Depression and The Holocaust came about. The story is very imaginative and different from the norm, which is always a fantastic change in pace when it comes to film. At the same time though, those who like having absolutely everything explained to them will probably be disappointed. The Adjustment Bureau explains enough to get the wheels in your brain turning and leaves some things open to your interpretation, which could hurt someone's overall opinon of the film depending on the viewer.<br /><br />I've never been the biggest Matt Damon fan. My favorite memory involving him was the Team America parody that he wasn't even involved with, but I think of that \\"Matt Damon!\\" line every time I see him on screen. However, he did have strong showings in both Hereafter and True Grit from last year. He keeps the trend going here. David seems to be a guy who was once fueled by speaking in front of hundreds of people and politics, but has now replaced that void with Elyse. The chemistry he has with Elyse, despite feeling somewhat brief, is one of the driving factors of the film. Anthony Mackie winds up being the most memorable bureau agent mostly because he has an emotional tie to David, but John Slattery and Terence Stamp have some pretty noteworthy performances as well.<br /><br />I have the impression that a lot of people will write this off as a Men In Black ripoff, but The Adjustment Bureau is a bit more clever than either Men In Black film. The films surely have their similarities, but The Adjustment Bureau deserves to be given a chance. I think it'll surprise a lot of viewers.<br /><br />The Adjustment Bureau is easily the smartest live-action film to be released in the first few months of 2011. With a solid cast, a hefty helping of creativity, and just an absorbing experiencing overall, The Adjustment Bureau is bound to leave a lasting impression when it comes time to look back on the best films of the year. The film leaves you questioning how much of your life is really left to fate and chance. Films seem to leave an impression that lasts longer if it makes you think or strikes a cord or hits close to home in some capacity. This film does that and then some. It comes highly recommended even if you have your reservations about it.t of hundreds of people and politics, but has now replaced that void with Elyse.

B000BNI90O|5.0|There's not much I can add to the previous detailed reviews. I will say this, that at the moment of writing this, that there are 2 sets left(I dearly hope for your sake that there is a restock) and both those sets are near $160. I ordered mine in December 2010 and only purchased this because I was given a gift card (I had always deemed $50 to high but now I know differently).  Immediately upon receiving the soundtrack I was struck by the care put into the presentation of the packaging and the booklet accompanying it. the Presentation follows from the example laid down by our beloved Tolkien himself, Peter Jackson and Howard Shore in their dedication to perfection. As you know, there are 5 discs of music in this set which I promptly downloaded to iTunes in 320kbps. It is excellent music, so you need excellent headphones. End of statement. Laptop speakers or any headphones/earbuds under $100 really insult the artists work that went into making the superior sound. The LotR experience isn't cheap, so don't you be.  You won't buy this if you aren't a LotR fan. That is one reason the price is such. I had always heard from people that it was far too pricey(it certainly is now!), but for someone to buy this, they would likely have to be a LotR enthusiast. 3 hours of music is a lot for anyone. The price per song for me in this set was around 75c, 25% lower than that of iTunes. I won't comment on the music because you obviously know that it is all the emotion and passion of the film without the visual. You can buy all the theatrical soundtracks for around $30 to get a sample. This is the first set from the three films, I am happy to say that The Two Towers and The Return Of The King: Complete Recordings are in transit to my house right now. Once I had the first I knew I needed the last two.   As a last note, I eagerly await the details of the Hobbit films to be released in 2012. They too are going to be made with the highest quality and attention to detail that will surely fascinate people as it always has.  Thanks goes to the originator of this fantastical journey, Tolkien himself.  I will end now and continue listening to the music I have previously commented on.
B003Y5H53S|5.0|Director Gore Verbinski has put together quite the filmography over the years. His first feature film was the family comedy Mousehunt, which he followed up with the R-rated action comedy The Mexican. He also jumped on the successful remake bandwagon before the trend really took off with The Ring. It was the Pirates of the Caribbean films that teamed the director with the hottest actor in Hollywood today; Johnny Depp. Perhaps it's because those films made over a billion dollars at the box office or because they just had fun working together or a little bit of both that Depp was chosen to voice a talking chameleon in Verbinski's bizarre yet spectacular animated adventure known as Rango.<br /><br />Rango isn't your average animated film. That fact will become abundantly clear during Rango's opening monologue amongst his \\"friends.\\" The film is actually more adult than any of the trailers let on. Within the first ten minutes of the film, Rango has a rather lengthy conversation with some fresh roadkill. In addition to that, the last half of the film is much darker than the first half. Maybe it's the countless number of bats with gatling guns strapped to them, Rattlesnake Jake being one of the most menacing animated villains in years, the film using its fair share of both \\"hell\\" and \\"damn\\" quite a few times, the film not shying away from the use of nooses, or, God forbid, animated characters smoking, but Rango just doesn't feel like an everyday, run-of-the-mill film put out by Nickelodeon.<br /><br />Rango also wears its western references on its sleeve. The old time saloons, tumbleweeds, stare downs before a gunfight, and a town's utmost desire for both a sheriff and something to believe in are proof of that. But perhaps it's Timothy Olyphant's cameo appearance as The Spirit of the West that is both the biggest homage to westerns you could possibly think of and the biggest surprise of the film (at least as far as his appearance goes). Well it's either that or the Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas reference. Both are equally amazing.<br /><br />This has the atmosphere of an animated film that was made for adults. It's very off-balanced in the best kind of way, but a lot of the references and humor are sure to go over a child's head. Some of the characters in the film talk really fast (mostly just Rango and Beans at times) and while Rango is goofy enough to make the kids laugh, the subject content involving the town of Dirt certainly seems to be aimed towards a more mature sense of humor.<br /><br />Rango is the first animated film from Industrial Light & Magic, the special effects company that did computer generated effects for the first three Star Wars films and the effects for the T-1000 in Terminator 2 among countless others. The film looks phenomenal. There were times when Rango looked like he was walking in an actual desert. While the characters weren't quite as detailed as the owls in Legend of the Guardians, they still looked incredibly realistic or as realistic as talking animals could possibly be.<br /><br />Rango is one of the most eccentric animated films you'll ever have the pleasure of sitting through. Its homage to westerns combined with its explosive action sequences, an endless amount of hilarity, tender and sentimental moments that actually make you feel sorry for a talking lizard, and even a little bit of romance pretty much has all your bases covered as far as genres are concerned. Rango is a dark, witty, and entertaining ride that's also fairly mature for an animated film. All in all, Rango is easily the best movie of 2011 so far.s Vegas reference. Both are equally amazing.

0061537969|5.0|Just finished re-reading this book. Didn't cry quite as much as the first time around, but it still had the power to move me to tears. Such a great story, and so well written.     I love the juxtaposition between the racing metaphors and the story of Enzo and Denny. Nicely balanced. The pace of this book is masterful. The philosophy is brilliant. The tension of the story is beautifully countered by the bits of comic relief.     If you have ever loved a dog, I think you would love this novel. Highly recommended.

Its a concept album with very good lyrics and amazing musiv and sound. And when i say amazing i mean AMAZING. Its too excellent - perfect - superb. Tyhe guitars are amazing with very melodic aggressive guitars and they really know how to paly quality and good music. The vocals are one of the best i have ever hear. I cant decide which song is better than the other. A must for all.
B004AP09CU|5.0|I'm struggling to come to terms with folks who claim to be Bruce Springsteen fans griping about trivialities. No vinyl, $1.29 a song, etc. I'm ashamed of you, you're just not close to the bar \\"The Boss\\" raised so high back in 1978 while \\"raising a Cain! I'm sorry for anyone who can't understand the significance of a MP3 Remastered \\"Darkness On The Edge of Town,\\" man I feel as blessed as I did when I first heard this wonderful album on vinyl back in 1978. It takes me there all shined up, renewed, like a new dime spinning in the 78 summer sun. Just a shot of that howl down the ages from \\"Something in the Night,\\" has ignited a million bonfires in the hearts of the faithful, and newcomers who have found what it's like to peer over the edge and take a giant leap into \\"The Promised Land.\\" Bruce never quit or complained, he just bore down and kept \\"The Promise\\" to keep on livin' and still go \\"Racing in the Street.\\" If ya wanna come along toss me your car keys, just sit back and let's take ride to the sea and wash these sins off our hands.\\". I would discuss how great this album is, how much depth and emotion it contains, the powerful message spilling over the edges like the splendor of a fresh new day, but I won't. It's better that you wait in agony, for the first notes to register in your ears, and embed in your heart.... It's better to realize the wonder of where we now stand, and the ethereal past from which we have emerged via who many consider the greatest musical artist who has ever walked the earth, picked up a guitar, gathered others with him and set out on a journey to change the landscape of rock n' roll or all time \\" delivered. The Boss and the E Street Band at their absolute peak,this and  21 peerless songs, a great lost work recovered and easily one of the best albums released in 2010. What? So there you have it, a \\"promise, what more do you really want from life?
B00009L1UP|4.0|After their masterpiece Operation Mindcrime they came with this album. It is a very good album with great songs. My favorite songs are Empire and Anybody Listening (What an amazing song). The production is very good and the sound of the guitars are <<the something else>>.  must for Queensryche fans and an album that most people in the metal scene will like.
B001N26GFM|5.0|This is an amazing movie. Although it didn't get much recognition, it definitely deserves it. Bruno, the 9-year-old son of an SS officer, who was moved to the countryside, next to a concentration camp, is completely oblivious to everything that is going around him. He seems somewhat naive - almost a little too naive, when everything around him is against Jews and for the Nazis. He makes friends with one Shmuel, a boy in the concentration camp, wearing 'striped pajamas,' who lives in the 'farm.' Bruno thinks Shmuel is lucky, being able to 'play' with so many friends and to wear 'pajamas' all day. He sneaks food and games for Shmuel, and eventually begins to learn about the differences between him and the people behind the fence.    If you are planning to read the book as well, the book is more seen through the eyes of a young child. The movie is definitely for an older audience, and show Bruno's family more as a unit than the book does.    Although the it's rated PG-13, it might not seem like it at the beginning. The subject that this movie is dealing with is very delicate, but I think that the director did a great job of handling it. Although the movie never explicitly shows what happens to Bruno and Shmuel - you can find that out for yourself - you get the gist of it, and I think that is the worst part - not in a bad way! The movie really makes you think and gives a lot of food for thought. Be forewarned, tears will come! The book and movie are slightly different, but they are both worth taking a look at. There is a great message to be learned in the movie, like the subtitle says: innocence lost, humanity found. The ending of the movie is extremely sad, but the message is very powerful and you will not be disappointed.
B002RWKSII|4.0|Fabulous!  Brian goes to another level.  And, the timelessness of Gershwin shines through these arrangements.<br />But - a caution to \\"classic heads\\" - it's Reimagined, not Performed as George wrote it.  Only disappointment was the Rhapsody in Blue cuts are way too short!
B000FBJAOG|5.0|As a good scout always says be prepared, and with this book everyone will be.       This was the first Â«zombieÂ» book i had ever read, and to put it short it was awesome.   There are some wonderful tips in this book, if ever you are attacked by zombies. Such as the best gun to use is a semi~automatic rifle, the best transportation is a bicycle, and many other tips.    The way Max writes makes it seem that its real, or maybe he knows more than he's leting on
B004IM14RY|1.0|Some of you may reasonably assume that you can't go wrong with a movie that only costs 99 cents. Well, you are wrong. Ryan Reynolds, as always, is pretty bad as an actor. However, the script and the plot don't help him at all. The film has to many cliches like a cell phone that works, but then doesn't work at the just the right moments, people that put him on hold, etc. For some reason, he is equipped with a lighter, a pen, an empty wallet, and a cell phone. I hear that he has other things in the coffin with him, but I couldn't watch anymore of the film. Most of us would realize that there is a limited supply of air in a coffin, but Reynolds keeps lighting the lighter to make phone calls. The cell phone provides its own light, so why use a lighter every time you make a call? This is one of the many puzzling things that I noticed during the short time that I watched. Also, I can understand that any person would panic if they found themselves locked in a coffin and buried in Iraq of all places, but some things really don't make sense. As a military contractor, he doesn't realize that the U.S. government won't pay ransoms for captured personnel. Also, he seems to want to antagonize everyone he calls to get help. On one call someone asks him for his social security number. He gets angry and starts asking why they want it instead of simply giving it to the person. I mean, how else are they going to be able to identify you as the appropriate person (he lost the security number that was given to him by the contract company). I don't know about you, but if I was given an emergency number to use in case something happened while working in Iraq during a war, I would make sure I memorized it, tattooed it on my skin, and do whatever else I could to make sure it is available in case something happened. In the end, .99 cents is way too much to pay for this movie. I would have been a lot more upset if I paid full price at the movies theatre, but it is just .99. I could have gottensomething from the .99 menu at my local fast food joint. A chocolate Frosty feel kind of good right now.

0142410322|1.0|While it's true that CHARLIE AND THE GREAT GLASS ELEVATOR picks right up where CHOCOLATE FACTORY left off, it does not continue on the same fun-filled path.  There are adventures in space, a fight with an alien species, and many other senseless adventures which may work well in another children's story (or stories, since many of them do not work well in the same story).  There is no central, cohesive plotline.  There are no lessons or morals.  The most glaringly absent item from this book is the sweetness and charm of its predecessor.  I'll not read this again nor will I recommend it to anyone of any age.
0156027321|4.0|Although I have never regretted buying any of the books I have purchased in my life, Life of Pi is one of my most celebrated possessions. I now have two copies, one to lend to anyone who wants to borrow it and another to be kept neatly exhibited in the top most rack of my personal library.(I keep two copies of all my favourites.)   What I loved about the book was the phenomenon behind the story. Often one comes across people who have lost more than one( sometimes all) of their family members in accidents. I invariably fail to estimate their pain or imagine how they cope with life after being deprived of everything precious in life - all the love, care and affection. This book is based on one person's most unique way of dealing with such a loss.   The book captivated me in more than one way. As soon as I finished reading it, I started again; I wanted to read it in new light - now separating imagination from reality. Sometimes I stopped to ponder whether a certain incident was real or fantasized. Moreover, the imagery is so vivid that after reading this book I feel that I am as familiar to the Pacific as any voyager is.   I recommend this book as a 'Must Read\\".
B000HEWEJO|5.0|Frank Capra's timeless tale of life, love, and limits continues to transcend generational barriers and probably always will.  Though often and incorrectly referred to as only a Christmas movie - it is that but so much more! - IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE brings to life a simpler time in American life and culture, the best of which we're always trying to get back to.    One thing that really amazes me is that the hero of the movie, George Bailey, was not allowed to serve in World War II, because he was 4-F, a status that drove some men to suicide!  And here it is, 1946, right after the end of WWII, and our protagonist and hero is 4-F!  I often wonder what that did to the morale of many of the 4-F men who desperately wanted to serve.    For many of us who live in small town America, there is an even greater connection and appreciation for Bedford Falls and its inhabitants.  No, George you can't leave that crummy old town.  You need it as much as it needs you.
1934356557|5.0|\\"SQL Antipatterns\\" by Bill Karwin is a collection of 4~7 page chapters, each neatly organized into:  1) Here's something people often need to do  2) Here's the stupid solution they often come up with  3) Here's why that's a bad idea  4) Here's what you should do instead    The nice, bite-sized chapters along with the \\"standalone\\" nature of each are reminiscent of \\"Effective Java,\\" another favorite.    Among other cuteness, the author refers to foreign keys that relate to multiple tables as \\"promiscuous\\"... I give extra points to anyone who can weave a little innuendo into an SQL text.

031603438X|5.0|This book is a very sincere recollection of life stories. The good, the bad and even the bitter. As a lifelong addict to the Rolling Stones music I read this book very slowly. There were a lot of references to music and artists that I wanted check again. The glamour and mysticism of the Rolling Stones used to obscure the fact that there have been some terrifying moments in their lives. I got a new angle of viewing the stones and how much on the edge they had been at times. And again, they key element of the book that struck me in was Keith's sincerity.         D.

B0031YJFCQ|3.0|I really felt this way about the whole series... everyone was either super good or super bad.  There was very little gray regarding these characters (except perhaps Blomkvist being a poor father, which is passingly acknowledged in book #1). Generally speaking, I hate these types of books and usually I roll my eyes and I have to force myself to finish them (once I begin a book, I must finish it).  Yet, that didn't apply to any of the books in this series.  I continued to read them, compulsively. I knew where it was going, I had a very strong hunch who would win the day and yet I looked forward to any moment I could spend reading the book. I do agree with one reviewer who felt the plot meandered a bit in this last book.<br /><br />It is like a Law & Order episode where the majority of the time is spent preparing for trial and that is also where the climax occurs (and to be fair, it is a very well-done).  And also like Law & Order, you wonder if there might be a monkey wrench thrown into the heroes' plans at the last minute as you watch them plan and prepare in the name of \\"truth and justice\\"(don't worry, I won't tell you)<br /><br />So, I guess the author did what he was supposed to do: he allowed me to lose myself in a story and perhaps I should give the book 4-stars for doing that...but there were just too many mental \\"eyeball rolls\\" as I read how amazingly smart Salander was, how wonderfully non-judgmental Blomkvist was, how efficiently competent Berger was and how kindly selfless Palmgren was...(sorry, if the spellings are way off, I am going off memory). Maybe 3.5 stars?
0767827902|5.0|It's been forty years since this film debuted, and I have a strong feeling that there are still some towns like this one, small and fading and filled with sad, lonely, desperate souls. The town in this movie is changing, and we are privy to the ramifications. There's been so very much said and discussed about \\"The Last Picture Show\\", and it's understandable. It's a strong, confident piece of cinema with some great acting and writing and craftsmanship.<br /><br />There are some powerful moments in it, and even more importantly, there are a few quiet moments in it where characters speak volumes to each other without uttering one word. This is, more than anything, a character study, and you could argue that one of the characters is the town. Now, on the surface it seems that not much is going on here, but in reality there is a lot happening. It dawns on you as you get pulled in.<br /><br />A couple of standouts linger in the mind after viewing this film; Cloris Leachman is outstanding and understated for the most part in her role. Also, Ellen Burstyn shines as a woman who once knew love but all too briefly. Both actresses are excellent here. But this is definitely an ensemble piece, and newcomers to this film might be taken aback by all the familiar faces.<br /><br />Suffice to say that any film buff worth his or her salt should experience this wonderful tale of Americana in a state of flux. It is a beautiful black and white movie, and a poignant one... a gem. And it never fails to bring a few tears to my eyes.

0071636080|5.0|\\"The Presentation Secrets of Steve Jobs\\" explores the methodology of what is behind one of the great corporate communicators of this generation. For years now, audiences have sat in amazement as Jobs does his annual Apple and MacWorld presentations with minimal slide shows and maximum impact. Gallo deconstructs what makes these presentations uber-effective and how you can learn from these examples to improve your public communication.<br /><br />The first, and most obvious method, is utilizing the `less is more' philosophy, which Jobs is the master of. Often times Jobs reduces his message to a single word on a simple black backdrop to make his point. As with \\"Innovative Secrets,\\" Gallo explores the beauty of simplicity and how it is easier said than done. At one point, the author compares the speeches of Jobs vs. tech rival Bill Gates and illustrates how Gates gets mired in longer sentences with harder words, employes `lexical density' and falls victim to the `fog index,' while Jobs keeps is short, tight and simple. Gallo goes so far as to analyze Jobs right down to the phrases, gestures and even the pauses that Jobs makes to burn in his message. The book gives helpful hints on how to assemble, rehearse (and videotape) your presentation in advance to have the best chance of making the most impact on your audience. For the many people that are looking to study what makes a Jobs presentation \\"insanely great,\\" this is clearly the book for you.
1439102724|4.0|Even though I've read all of Jodi's books and knew how this one would unfold by page 120, I still enjoyed it.  Sure, it follows her standard formula (shifting perspectives, controversial topic, big court battle), but she presents her stories in an approachable and captivating way.<br /><br />Two cent summary: Zoe and Max can't have a baby together, so they get a divorce. She ends up with Vanessa.  Max becomes a born again Christian.  So there are the major themes: infertility (and pro-life/choice issues), homosexuality and religious fundamentalism.  I thought Jodi did a great job describing the heartbreak and desperation of Zoe's infertility.  There were some unsavory characters like the evangelicals, whose zealousness was frustrating and came off as ignorant.  I was not thrilled with Vanessa's introduction, which felt like a long justification of her sexuality and its effect on her lifestyle and relationships. Although I predicted the path the novel was going to take, I was pleasantly surprised with the final outcome.  It delivered exactly what I have come to expect as a Jodi fan.
B000JIJPZY|3.0|Cute, for a little while.  My baby is 4.5 months old, and I highly doubt this will be used after he starts sitting up.    the \\"pillow\\" for the headrest and for supporting a child to sit up is a complete and total joke.  I would never leave my baby sitting up with that thing around, it would just help him fall over.  Also, the pillow has no way to stay in place while he is laying down or sitting up.  It slides all over the place.  In fact, I have no idea where it is now.  It was an annoying to keep up with it.    The mirror is another joke.  So tiny, I don't see how a baby can even see in it.  Fisher price must have been using leftover pieces from other mirrors, it's so small.    I can see that as my baby learns to grab better, that the velcro on toys won't be staying up for long.    However, all that negative said, it does keep his attention for a little while.
0439023513|4.0|I love this series, and recommend it to everyone. I read Mockingjay, and closed the cover thinking. Really!?! I wont spoil anything, but know that the first few chapters are slower going than The Hunger Games and Catching Fire. As usual with this author (Read all of the Gregor books as well) the last 2-3 chapters are a riot of events and chaos. I liked the way it ended, even if it wasn't exactly what I expected. There are several *gasp* moments, upsetting moments, moments of pure bliss, etc, all that I have come to expect from Suzanne Collins. Although I liked this book, I know an equally obsessed Hunger Games reader and she denies this books existence. If you are wanting a finally, it provides. If you are wanting a perfect, not messy, happy ending...you are reading the wrong series. If you have read book 1 and 2, that should not surprise you. The only real complaint about this book that I have is that there are a few events that I would have like to have more details on. Sometimes, something in this book happens and you are thinking, \\"Oh, that is going to play an important role later.\\" only to find that it is either never revisited or a summary is given after the events unfolded behind the scenes. ((((((*Slight spoiler* Also, I am a Katniss/Peeta fan, and he is just not in the book enough.))))))    Over all, I loved this book and really can't imagine how else it COULD have ended, or SHOULD have ended. Expect a roller coaster of emotions and viewing characters in a new light. Some you loved, my disappoint, and some you hated, may end up being a new favorite.    Hope this helps!  God Bless!  -Big Time Reader
B004EBT5CU|5.0|This album is amazing. Adele is amazing. Her lyrics, her singing, her everything. Not one song in this cd is bad, each song in it's own right is perfect. Her voice is earth shatteringly good. Mind you though, the one song in this cd that i cannot give enough of and i cannot cry whenever i listen to it is \\" SOMEONE LIKE YOU\\". WOW! You can feel her pain and her words ring true within each note that she sings. It's everything i hope for it to be and much more.<br /><br />THIS BETTER GET A GRAMMY NOMINATION FOR 2012.
B003Z39G0O|5.0|OK, I admit I do love the show, but I wasn't expecting much from the CD. The soundtrack is awesome! There are several songs (Obsession, Cut, Bloodstream) that should be on the radio, although they are more indie than mainstream. I would recommend this CD to anyone that enjoys the Twilight soundtracks (New Moon is my favorite).
0670022411|4.0|I really loved this first book from Deborah Harkness and cannot wait for the next one.  The book started a little bit slow but then quickly built up steam.  Not only are there twists and turns as you come to understand the world she's portraying but you really come to understand and root for the characters she introduces.  A splendid blend of plot and characters.  I read quite a few series about mythical beings (witches, werewolves, etc.) and this is one of the best so far.  I strongly encourage you to try this book out.
B003LD9P4K|3.0|In itself a wonderful registration of what must have been an awesome show. With the exception of \\"Tiger in the spotlight\\" which is too silly to talk about, the set list is exactly what you'd expect. And after 25 or so years, ELP is still a great and very professional band (even though they - once again - appear not to be talking much to one another).    Plus: This may be the only chance to see a Moog #1 synth live in action. With the promise of crisp pic and audio. And the pic quality is very good indeed.    Minus: I have an issue with the audio mix, though. The rear surround speakers are way too loud and drown out the front speakers including Greg's vocals. And the bass guitar is hardly audible - you would be forgiven for believing this is a synth & drums outfit. My subwoofer didn't even kick in. I found myself downgrading to the PCM stereo mix to improve my listening experience. That is not what you'd expect from a HD-Master sound track.
0756404738|2.0|Spoilers Ahead.<br /><br />Let me start by saying I rather liked the first book, it had issues, but it was interesting, a fresh world, interesting storytelling, good magic system, but that cannot be said of this book.<br /><br />1 - Too long, nothing happens in the first 25% of the book (I read the Kindle version) other than some problems with the cardboard character Ambrose which is a pointless subplot that leads nowhere, and adds nothing to the story. The middle part of the book, where they are wandering the woods looking for the bandits was much MUCH longer than needed, full of filler, never-ending tales and boring exposition, it introduces and tries to flesh out 3 characters that are not mentioned anywhere else in the book, and I say try, since the characters are extremely dull.<br /><br />2 - At the rate Kvothe story is progressing, this series will not be a trilogy, or the 3rd book will be 2 thousand pages long and rushed, its been 1673 pages between the 2 books, and only 2 years have passed in the story, Kvothe the storyteller is around 28 I believe, the younger Kvothe is 17 at the end of the book.<br /><br />3 - The underlining plot does not move an inch, there are several references about the Chandrian in the book, but they consist of Kvothe receiving a reproduction made by a girl of a plate depicting the Chandrian, and for some reason one of the Chandrian was leading the bandits in the woods under a disguise. There is no interaction with them, no further information about them, nothing relevant to the plot, I can't stress this enough, NOTHING.<br /><br />4 - The first book presented several interesting questions, what happened to Kvothe to make him end up at the inn, waiting to die? what about the strange insects that are attacking the country? What is going on with the Chandrian? and many others, NONE are answered in this book.<br /><br />5 - Again too long, this book seriously needed an editor, its about 400 pages too long, and I'm being generous, edit the University parts where nothing happens, edit the long, pointless travels through the woods, edit the part with the Ardem, edit the parts with Danna, it just repeats the same thing over and over.<br /><br />In any case, if you read the first book, I doubt my review will change your mind about reading this one, just remember I warned you.the long, pointless travels through the woods, edit the part with the Ardem, edit the parts with Danna, it just repeats the same thing over and over.    In any case, if you read the first book, I doubt my review will change your mind about reading this one, just remember I warned you.
B000002JSJ|2.0|The songs in this album are for the most part long and not<br />very commercial; that's why you rarely (if ever) hear them on<br />the radio. I only like three of them: Tea for one,<br />nobody's fault buy mine and Achilles last stand. I enjoy<br />their last album much more.
0143118706|5.0|This is a great book to read! I bought it because I really love Eat. Pray. Love movie AND a book! Not too much of a plot in Committed, but very deep and philosophical ideas, conversations, and reasoning about relationship and marriage in particular. I learned a lot from this piece!
B00475AYJQ|2.0|Sorry, have to disagree. Read the first book and just finished the second. Bought the second 8 minutes after it was available so one could say I was looking forward to it. It was weak. At best it is setting up he next book which I will also buy but only because the first was Soooo great. Have basically stopped caring about the main character. Can't imagine how 57 people have already reviewed the book unless they didn't actually read it. Sorry but it is pretty weak. Rad the first book because it totally rocked.
0618918248|4.0|\\"Could we, by training and practice, emancipate ourselves from Middle World, tear off our black burka, and achieve some sort of intuitive - as well as just mathematical - understanding of the very small, the very large, and the very fast? I genuinely don't know the answer, but I am thrilled to be alive at a time when humanity is pushing against the limits of understanding. Even better, we may eventually discover that there are not limits.\\"    Richard Dawkins is a British scientist, world widely known for being an atheist and fighting for atheists' rights. He is also an acclaimed biologist and evolutionist (although I think both are utterly connected), emeritus professor at University of Oxford's New College, where he was Professor for Public Understanding of Science from 1995 to 2008. Most of his published books are in defense of science, reason and humanism and, therefore, he is also the founder of The Richard Dawkins Foundation for Reason and Science.     I always thought of Richard Dawkins as a militant atheist (and I still do, in fact), though I agree that his arguments in favor of reason and science are legitimate and certainly well-thought and developed (I still think you don't really have to think much to trust science, anyway). In this book, he criticizes and supports the inexistence of God, described in most Holy Books of modern religions. But the main purpose of his work is to put down supernatural faith in every sense. He divided his book in ten chapters - probably to make an analogy to the biblical Ten Commandments - and, in each of them, he treats an issue of the existence, inexistence and need of God and religion (and he does it pretty well).     If you are a believer, this book won't change your mind. In fact, this book probably won't even touch your faith - or shouldn't, anyway -, whatever is your creed. This book will, of course, show an atheist (and a very well-knowledge one) view on life, the universe and everything else. Pretty interesting, uh?I admit I am no atheist myself, though I tend to act like one sometimes. I am mostly agnostic, or whatever you call someone who doesn't give a damn about if there's a God or not (or at least I try not to give a damn about) and I find it much better to have this behavior. One of the reasons I consider Dawkins a militant atheist is that he is always trying to preach atheism the same way priests and pastors preach gospel - in fact, some people told me this book would change my mind on Dawkins militancy, but it didn't. I find it much easier to live a life not caring if other people think they have an imaginary friend (or if there's actually one) or if they don't and think that's just paranoia. And he kind of criticizes agnostics for not giving a damn, I agree with him in a few topics, such as how religion has destroyed - and still is - mankind and hidden its potential for scientific development - you know, I'm very fond of science myself.     Dawkins uses biblical controversies provocatively to make you think - or even better, reason - about if there's an all-powerful God which is both evil and good and shows that the same argument used for the existence of a supernatural being may be very well confused with psychiatrically studied patterns of mind. He even sometimes laughs - and it is pretty laughable, if you want my opinion on this matter - at some creeds still held by people who think religion holds all truth there is, such as Adam & Eva, Earth's 12.000 years, the world-wide flood and some other things many people take as absolute and irrefutable truth.     Dawkins uses some really good and solid arguments pro-science and against religion - and I do agree with most, if not all, of them -, though he's a very lousy reality checker. I mean, he is good at describing and perhaps philosophizing a world with no religion at all. Reality isn't free of religion. In fact, society still holds a very and powerful tie with supernatural beings and powers. It is an unarguably fact. Dawkins seems to avoid this and offers no solution; he's just criticizing religion, powering up science and imagining what the world would be if people abandoned their beliefs. The fact is: it is not going to happen soon. We have to deal with religion and unfortunately this is the way it's going to work for the next *many* years. I'm not saying we, nonbelievers, should just sit down and watch the world burn with unreasoned faith, but we should at least respect if we want to be respected. Most of world still believes and we are a minority. If we wish to be respected, we must respect. It's pretty much what democracy holds itself.     Anyway, this book is a great read. I recommend it for religious or non-religious people who wish to have a quite unique view on Dawkins' view of believing. Just don't go out and tell him or every atheist to burn in hell because you don't agree with their views. Perhaps this book will even help you to understand what atheism is.    80/100

1433523922|5.0|When my NIV study Bible started falling apart I began a month long search for \\"The Best Study Bible\\". I have been an NIV fan for many years but I missed the poetic flow of the KJV So, I decided to check out the other versions. After hundreds of articles and reviews comparing the most popular versions I settled on the ESV. Now to decide which one. I looked at 3 versions, the MacArthur study bible, the Ryrie study bible and then the ESV Study Bible. (I had also looked at some NKJV study bibles)    The Review:  As stated \\"This Bible is BIG\\" and has a lot of pages.  Pros:  1. Print: the print in this bible is very big. I wear glasses and can read this bible without them.    2. The leather cover is very nice. It has a soft yet sturdy feel to it.    3. High quality paper was used to print this bible. I almost wish they had used a heavier paper which would have made it better for note taking and marking but then the bible would have been even heavier.    4. The bible has stitched binding and looks to be very sturdy. I am impressed at how thick the stitching is.    5. This bible is over stuffed with info. Not including the study notes, this bible is really packed with historical facts and useful information. Book pre-faces have all the standard info and much more. Notes are included throughout along with some of the best color pictures (drawings) and maps I have ever seen.    6. An AWESOME feature is that it also has an access code for the ESV Online study bible. This website has been completely thought out and designed with the user in mind. It has everything I could possibly want in an online study aide. You can add notes, highlight words or passages, put in your own refs, a great search feature, Audio bible reading (with a choice of 2 different readers) and I am now in the habit of listening to my daily reading as I read because you can hear the readers emotions as he reads the scripture, all of the study notes and maps/info of the printed version, and quite a few different reading plans. And probably more that I haven't used yet.    7. The Study Notes:  The NIV has useful and somewhat detailed notes but they have a sterile feel to them. Sort of like reading a dictionary. The study notes in this bible are outstanding and my primary reason for choosing it. They are personal and have an opinion. \\"GOD IS!\\" As you read them you can feel the writers love and admiration for the God we serve. All the notes that I have read so far approach scripture from a fundamental viewpoint and while giving you the in depth study information they retain a personal and emotional feel to them. Example from study notes:   Gen. 1:1-2:3 God's Creation and Ordering of Heaven and Earth. The book of Genesis opens with a majestic description of how God first created the heavens and earth and then how he ordered the earth so that it may become his dwelling place. Structured into seven sections, each marked by the use of set phrases, the entire episode conveys the picture of the all-powerful, transcendent God who sets everything in place with consummate skill in conformity to his grand design.    Cons:  1. No red letter version  2. No thumb index tabs  3. IT IS BIG  4. Finding a bible cover for it was hard. But the Wordkeeper ® Ballistic Briefcase Bible Cover from Christianbooks.com fits just fine.    Overall I am very, very happy with this study bible. I believe it will be my best friend for many years to come.
B000A1SZ2Y|5.0|After seeing some amazing macro photos taken with a Panasonic FZ35 like mine, and this lens, I ordered one from Amazon for myself.  For the FZ35, an adapter is required, and I also bought an Adorama 46mm Step-Down Adapter Ring on Amazon to go with this lens.<br /><br />This combination is easy to install and take off, and gives my camera new capabilities that it never had before.  The focus range is very narrow, so it takes some practice with this lens to learn how close to get to the subject.  Basically, I learned that I could leave the camera in auto-focus mode, and move toward my subject until things came into focus.  A small movement closer or away will change the point of focus, so for example, if you are taking a front-quarter view of an inchworm, you move a bit closer or further away to change the focus point from its tail to its head.<br />The lens causes some vignetting at the wide end of the zoom, so I zoom in very slightly to get past that.  It seems that the more you zoom, the tighter that narrow focus range becomes, so I use the widest zoom possible while still being zoomed in just enough to eliminate that vignetting.<br />I'm still a novice at this, so I may not be doing it right, but it works for me.  I'm sure the experts can tell you more about how to use it.<br /><br />Anyway, for a minimal investment, you can carry this lens with you and get some photos that you just couldn't get any other way.  Like me, you probably won't use it all that often, but when you do, I think you'll agree that the results are worth the small investment.

B003OJBWGK|4.0|One day at the rock climbing gym I heard Best Coast's \\"Boyfriend\\" and couldn't get it out of my freak'n head. I usually just download a song I really like instead of buying the complete album(I'm cheap that way) but I decided to gamble and pick up \\"Crazy for you\\". I can safely say I'm pleasantly surprised but not blown away by it. Best Coast is one of those bands that only do a couple things but they do them really well. The majority of \\"Crazy for you\\" consists of sort and sweet fuzzy pop songs about unrequited love. Singer/song writer Bethany Cosentino moans and coos about the one that got away or the one who doesn't understand her affections. She has a very haunting voice that sounds great with reverb. They have a very unique sound that can send chills down your spine. If you like shoe gaze, surf rock or self-deprecating love songs then Best Coast is for you. Put it in when the sun is setting, roll down the windows and just drive.

B003UESJHO|5.0|Mark Wahlberg laboured a long time to get this biographical film about \\"Irish\\" Micky Ward made, with himself in the title role as the boxer.  The result is well worth Wahlberg's investment, and one hopes he finds sufficient reward in that, despite what I imagine was a personal disappointment in not getting an Oscar nomination for the role.  The film did find considerable favour with the Academy despite that, earning seven nominations and an eventual two wins, becoming the first film to win two acting Oscars since fellow boxing drama \\"Million Dollar Baby\\" in 2004, and the first film to win both supporing acting awards since \\"Hannah and Her Sisters\\" in 1985.  For people not interested in sports films, \\"The Fighter\\" is a very atypical example of the genre.  With David O. Russell directing, perhaps it could not help but be atypical; Russell has a reputation as a hard man to work with, but Wahlberg seems the exception to the rule, having made three films with him as of now.  Spoilers follow.    Micky Ward (Wahlberg) is a would-be contender in Lowell, Massachusetts in the early 1990s when we first meet him (the film plays a bit loose with the passage of time; it begins in 1993, and the last event it depicts occurred in 2000, but it doesn't feel like anything near that amount of time has passed).  He has potential, but has never quite managed to go anywhere, and the clock is ticking (if this sounds a lot like \\"Rocky\\", it is, but then, this really happened).  A big part of Ward's problem is his career management, which is in the hands of his mother Alice (Melissa Leo), and his trainer/half-brother Dicky Eklund (Christian Bale).  Dicky is a former fighter who once lasted a whole fight against Sugar Ray Leonard, a moment of glory he relives obsessively even as he wastes away into drug addiction and general aimlessness.  Then there's his seven sisters, a hilariously-accent chorus to the family drama.  Into this environment steps Charlene (Amy Adams), a bartender who Micky hashis eye on.  Charlene and another trainer/police officer, Mickey O'Keefe (played by the real Mickey O'Keefe) demand that Micky break with his family in order to get his career going again.  Complications ensue.    Sports movies are a fairly formulaic genre by now, boxing films especially (boxing is also, incidentally, the Academy's favourite sport, to go by their nomination history).  Director Russell's approach changes things up; this is really more of a family drama than a boxing drama (though there's still plenty of that, for fans).  Micky's career is a family affair, and he has to find a way to reconcile the opposing factions.  In a lot of movies, this would be a fairly cut-and-dry issue, and it initially seems to be here as well, but Alice and Dicky, despite all their problems, do get their due, and Charlene is not pigeonholed as a flawless angel.  This greatly benefits all the characters.    Wahlberg, as previously stated, ultimately missed out on a nomination for his passion project, whereas his costars Leo, Adams, and Bale got nominations (and wins, in two cases).  His is a quiet lead performance (Roger Ebert remarked that Micky may have the least personality of any boxing movie protagonist he'd ever seen, and that wasn't meant as an insult to Wahlberg; he's just not a showy person, in a family otherwise full of vocal individuals), but the film wouldn't work if his performance didn't.  Christian Bale increasingly seems less an actor than a force of nature, once again shedding weight to play a character; Dicky is a skinny bundle of nerves, always moving, and whenever he's in a scene it's hard to take your eyes off him.  The Best Supporting Actor statuette was well-deserved.  Both Amy Adams and Melissa Leo were nominated for their work, with Leo winning for her turn as Alice.  Leo's is an equally showy performance.  Adams impresses in a part very different from her typical image.  A slew of character actors do well in supporting parts.    Highly recommended.
031603438X|5.0|One of the funniest books I've ever read -- filled with great stories, colorful cast of characters, terrific sense of language.  He's bright and often very insightful, despite having indulged in much foolishness.  A joy to read for a glimpse of Keith's sheer love of the music and life.
B000JMKQX0|4.0|Even given that he borrowed the format from Studs Terkel, Brooks still manages to build on the basic concept with the distinction and sharp characterizations of each person he profiles from chapter to chapter. The style of writing changes as each character steps forward; the location is vividly brought to life, and bit by bit a complete and sharply-defined landscape emerges. While the characters never become, say, literature, they certainly make an impression, from the man locked up in the asylum, to the ones I found most interesting: the glimpses of North Korea from the South, (a place I've been, and which frankly seems far too close to Brooks' vision than one would like), China, the former Soviet Union, and most strikingly, not just the submarine----but the bottom of the sea! The episodes that take place in the ship breaking yard and on the submarine was very striking, but it's the little details that leave you wanting more----the mention of the drowned cities in China, where the epidemic may have begun, the disappearance of an entire nation into its tunnels, the things mentioned in passing as background to the larger picture. I could go on and on and on but...I think I'll have to reread it again.
B0045U9WPU|3.0|I have to say this story was very well written and fun to read.  It wasn't a page turner but it was still fun to read.  I did have some issues with the story though.  For one I saw the ending coming. I kept hoping, reading and thinking that it would be different.  It wasn't and that's one of the reasons why the book didn't get five stars. I know two more books are coming in this series so in that respect the author had limited options to keep the story moving forward but she choose the most obvious ending.  I wish the ending would have shocked me with something I wasn't expecting.  So in that respect I was let down.  Of course I'm already thinking about what will happen next and am worried that it will be what I think it is.  Hopefully the surprise comes in book two.  Secondly certain things kept bugging me about what the main characters were doing.  Always meeting at the same house?  Okay, this is a very controlled society and Alex is an invalid who smuggled himself in, however, it never dawned on him to switch it up?  It was driving me insane through the whole story.  Third Lena finally wants to leave and not have her cure.  Definitely took her long enough to get to this point but then Alex has to go on some extra risky trip back over to the Wilds by himself first which I never understood, it seemed like a bad idea and it was.  It was all leading to the same conclusion and I was getting angry with the characters for being so stupid.  It was as if I was watching kids play with fire and they got burned.  All you can think is have you learned nothing?  Still the detail is good and their world is really boring and sterile so the characters seemed to match it.  Meaning no one really get's excited.  Life seems gray.  I do however think this is inline with their environment.  I expect people to be different in the Wilds.  As an aside Hana was interesting from the point of view that she didn't jump at leaving when presented with the option. She seemed to be one person wholiked to live in color.   Lastly I wanted to understand the cure itself better.  Yes, it's a brain operation behind your ear and it only works when you turn 18.  Why?  I don't recall my body chemistry changing the day I turned 18.  However it is mentioned that having the procedure sooner is dangerous.  It also left me to wonder about the segregation concept of boys and girls.  If a boy or girl fall in love does that mean the cure doesn't work then?  Are they the failures she writes about?  Meaning when you are actively in love, like Lena's mom was, is that the reason the cure didn't work on her?  Your brain chemistry isn't right for the cure to work?  I also had a tough time with understanding how the family unit still worked.  It was explained but I still couldn't buy it.  I was confused by Carol.  I also thought it was interesting that she got jumpy during the raid and angry at Lena for disobeying her.  It might have been helpful to have an understanding of what feelings people actually still have.  To me it just seemed from the writing that they wouldn't care if their houses burned down and their families were inside.  Who cares they feel nothing.  Your world is gray after the cure.  You don't get angry.  But you only get angry if you care?  I would have liked to have that explained better and why everyone in the US agreed to this in the first place.  Was the US over thrown?  I have a lot of unanswered questions that even the book of Shhh didn't answer for me.  Then again maybe in this society where no one asks questions or wants answers the questions I have cannot be answered until the next installment.    Good read but it should be less expensive for a Kindle.  I will wait till all the books are out to get the next one.
B003O86MY8|5.0|Expect the totally unexpected from David Garrett. Pieces you thought you knew well take on a whole new sound in a whole new dimension. The violin remains the violin, yet David Garrett gives the selections on this CD a new personality - a combination of haunting beauty and tempting youthful attraction. His interpretations resurrect the inspirations of the composers to give them new, vibrant life.
B001UV4XHY|5.0|If any popcultural product could be said to have dominated the first decade of the 21st century, it was \\"Harry Potter\\".  Between 1997 and 2011, the only years that did not see either a new book or film released were 2006 and 2008, and two years (2003 and 2007) had both.  Now, the saga is drawing to a close, with the seventh and final book being split into two films, staggered between the winter of 2010 and the summer of 2011.  At the helm once again is David Yates, who, when all is said and done, will have directed fully half of the films in the series, making his by far the most distinctive directorial imprint (though his borrows quite a bit from Alfonso Cuaron's tenure).  The decision to split the story in two has inspired two different sets of opinion, with some saying it drags things out and other welcoming the extra time.  I fall into the the latter category; the expanded canvas, in my view, allows the story to really breathe in a way that even the best of the preceding films (\\"Prisoner of Azkaban\\" and \\"Order of the Phoenix\\") did not.  Spoilers follow.    The preceding film ended with the death of Albus Dumbledore (Sir Michael Gambon), the greatest light wizard in the world.  This is akin to America's nuclear arsenal vanishing midway through the Cold War; any sense of balance of power has vanished, and Lord Voldemort (Ralph Fiennes) is moving quickly to finish the overthrow of the Ministry of Magic and kill Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe), the only potential threat to him.  Harry and his two closest friends, Ron (Rupert Grint) and Hermione (Emma Watson) have a quest of their own:  locate and destroy the four remaining Horcruxes of Lord Voldemort, which will render him mortal at last.  They have, unfortunately, very little sense of how to do this, and when Voldemort's forces come after them, they end up on the run, cut off from most of their allies.    Indeed, isolation is the key theme of this first half of the story.  The previous films were set mainly aroundHogwarts, which pointedly does not appear in this film at all.  Most of the supporting cast put in only brief, though usually memorable, appearances towards the start of the movie, and a few, such Professor McGonagall (Dame Maggie Smith) are absent entirely.  Yates and screenwriter Steven Kloves actually heighten the sense of isolation compared to the novel, where it was already pronounced - between leaving the Weasley residence and visiting Malfoy Manor, our heroes don't encounter a single friendly wizard, whereas in the book they met a few, and the wizard radio broadcasts have become merely a tally of missing or dead wizards.      Thus the weight of the production descends almost entirely on Radcliffe, Watson, and Grint, the young actors we've been following for a decade.  By now, these roles fit them like gloves, and they all do the best work of their young careers here.  Watson, who was the highlight of the early films in particular, is amazingly expressive here.  Radcliffe has what is in some ways the blandest role, that of the hero, but he does an excellent job with it.  A frequent fan complaint about previous films was how Ron lost much of his more serious material in favour of comic relief - Rupert Grint finally gets some really meaty dramatic material here (as well as some of his usual good comedy), and shows real skill in his handling of it.  The supporting actors, ranging from other young actors like Evanna Lynch and Matthew Lewis to experienced pros like Helena Bonham Carter, Jason Isaacs, and David Thewlis, all do their usual capable work.  Some, in particular Lewis as Neville, will get their big moments in the second part of the story.  The technical aspects of the production are, as one would expect, flawless.    Highly recommended.  Assuming Part 2 keeps this level of quality, and I see no reason to think it won't, this will go down as the series' strongest entry.
1401216676|5.0|This edition with the hard cover is amazing... Thew story and artwork are just remarkable.  If you Love batman  or the joker this is a must have!  in your collection.

B003954I9C|5.0|I really love this CD; it's upbeat but also has some great ballads.  It's an interesting mix of pop and dance beats, which breaks up the predictability of the album.
B001THMIGC|5.0|~~~one of my favorites!    when the movie came out, years ago, i went to the theatre several times to see it.  i realized recently that i needed to own it and purchased the dvd through amazon.    strange. confusing. wonderful.  captures the viewer.    christopher nolan is a great writer.    guy pierce is the perfect actor for this film.    i'll be watching it again and again, now that i own the dvd.
B000UDJS2S|4.0|It's evil vs. \\"kinda evil--ok, working for the devil and doing the devil's bidding even though he killed by daddy but other than that I'm not such a bad guy.\\" I don't know the comic character, but enjoyed the movie for what it was. Make sure you watch the interview with the teen punk chick who was saved by ghost rider. I can't imagine any bad dreams from this, but it was a fun movie to watch. Your date won't be snuggling up next you out of fear, but you can't have everything. This is one of those movies to watch on DVD with a great sound system and rumbling bass, and bowl of popcorn sprinkled with M&M's. Way to go Nicolas Cage!
B004H4XAXO|5.0|I really got hooked by this book after a few chapters. A satisfying story, and looking forward to the next one! A few minor clunky items, with some magic descriptions sounding like a physics puzzler video game. I liked the mix of characters, and the gradual revelations of the major plot twists in the last third of the book.
B002ZG9774|5.0|so i bought this movie expecting it not to shine because of all the negative critic reviews, but when i watched it i was loving it! this is such a great musical! it is fun and delivers to exactly what it is a FUN MUSICAL! i was very impressed by christina's debut acting skills and loved all the other cast as well. the make up, the costumes, the dance routine,the music, the glitz the glam, so much fun! with blu ray all the details of the make up and costumes are so clear it makes it that much inviting. so if you love great music great talent and feel good movie i highly recomend this!
0670022411|5.0|Thoroughly enjoyed this combination of witches,vampires,daemons, scholars and oenophiles.  Do not pick it up if you like a quick conclusion with cookie cutter characters. This is a book to savor, as layer after layer develops and matures in both plot and protagonist. Also, I would recommend having a glass of wine and a few snacks handy while you read. The settings are fresh and unusual, the history intriguing and the characters are memorable. Do not be put off by the few reviews that talk about it dragging. There are many of us that do not feel a story has to be told all at once- quickly before we loose focus- we can let the characters develop. A great start for a trilogy. I am VERY eager for the next installment.
B002KQ6BT6|2.0|Long book, using the exact same narrative...full of cliches and repetitive in context. Not a big fan of Dan Brown but I think he can do better than this...not read unless you really had nothing better to do
B004LGPBZI|4.0|It was in the infamous 1994 interview, which was dubbed Wibbling Rivalry, with the fueding brothers Gallagher that showed the world how the two founding members of the soon-to-be biggest rock band on the planet Oasis got on each other's nerves, and pretty much hated each other's guts. And it was the response of the younger brother with apparently the bigger attitude of the pair, and of course the better singing voice, to the final question from the interviewer, \\"Do you have any recurring dreams?\\" to which he cunningly responded with, \\"When I take over the band!\\"     It's taken Liam Gallagher 16 years for his dream to come true. Amazingly though, none of the original members of Oasis are still around, including Noel, who after 15 years of graciously putting up with Liam, walked out after a fiery confrontation backstage in the fall of 2009. It wasn't too long afterwards that Liam, Gem Archer, Andy Bell, along with newly recruited drummer Chris Sharrock decided to continue making music together as a band under a new name, Beady Eye, courtesy of Gallagher Jr.     With all the hype building up for their first album as a quartet, thanks to the many interviews with the band members, and the string of promotional singles released, Beady Eye looked like they were going to be the saviors of rock `n roll music, and a different but equally as genuine music entity as Oasis. The first taste of Beady Eye came in the form of Bring the Light, a classy but not extraordinary homage to the classic rock sound of the 50's , from the fast piano to the girls singing backup, where Liam, who wrote the song, seems to be paying homage to the most popular words ever used in rock songs, `baby' and `come on'; the word `baby', I must add, was once mentioned by Noel as a word he refuses to use in his songs. That was followed by the wall of sound, and most classic Oasis-sounding track on the album, the Andy Bell penned album opener Four Letter Word, a song which got me thinking Rock `n Roll Star. And finally, there was the cool Gem Archer written foot stomper The Roller, which as it turns out is the coolest track on the album in my opinion.     Different Gear, Still Speeding is a delightful album. It's not the greatest thing the guys can come up with for sure, but it's definitely one that will get them noticed, with more than one potential hit single. The country influenced Millionaire, another Andy Bell song, is a fitting second track. Bell's finest moment, though, on the album is Kill for a Dream, a potential follow-up single with possibly the best beautiful lyrics on the album, \\"Life's too short not to forgive, you can carry regrets, but they won't let you live, I'm here if you wanna call\\" And there's also the ballad The Beat Goes On, with equally inspiring lyrics, \\"Walked off the stage, faded away in through the clouds, to the gig in the sky, and when I arrived, the angels were singing a song, yeah you know the one, are you singing along?\\" Gem Archer shines on the psychedelic mini-trip Wind Up Dream, a song that's made catchier with the `woohs' and `ahhs' as well as the harmonica part; it's also a song that sounds like a missing track on The Beatles' Rubber Soul album, and that, of course, is a good thing. Gem also has the hard rocker Standing on the Edge of the Noise, a song that sounds under produced on record but would probably sound exciting live, and the 70's glam rock influenced Three Ring Circus, which sounds great. Liam makes his mark with the majority of the songs, 5 to be exact. The first is the not-so-surprising Beatles and Stones, where he declares that he will \\"stand the test of the time, like Beatles and Stones\\" and rightfully so; I mean what other lead singer in Britain's past 20 years has had such an impact on the music scene than Liam? Sadly, the song itself is a mediocre track and will not stand the test of the time. Then there's For Anyone, a song taken straight from Paul McCartney's textbook of ballad writing, with its infectious simplicity, and the semi-epical and longest track on the album Wigwam, a song that I just can't get enough of lately, with its \\"shalalas\\", and second half of Chris's aggressive drumming and Liam repeating the line \\"I'm coming up\\". Liam also has the closing track The Morning Son, a delightfully touching ballad that seems to be directed at John Lennon, or perhaps Noel Gallagher, \\"he's in my mind, he's in my soul, he's even in my rock `n roll.\\"     In conclusion, Different Gear, Still Speeding is a good start for Liam and co.     Recommended     B
B004L3AQFG|5.0|4.5 stars for the film, 5 for Ralston<br /><br />One of the most intense magazine pieces I've ever read is Ralston's own tale of his harrowing adventure/nightmare in Outside, September, 2004. I can still recall reading it while laying in bed in a little cabin on a cold night in the Rockies and feeling so luxurious just being alive, and wincing in vicarious pain as Ralston told his tale. I assume you know the tale, but if by some fluke you don't, stop reading this now! And avoid other reviews, friends, reading the video box, etc, because if you were to see this film without knowing the story ahead of time, it would probably blow your mind forever. Rarely has a true story seemed more dreamlike(or nightmarish) than Aron's.<br /><br />Happily, Danny Boyle and James Franco do his tale justice with this starkly real yet phantasmagorical film. Boyle's direction is typically shining and surreal, using sun flares on the lense and various other techniques to bring home the vast grandeur of the Utah canyonlands, and though nothing compares to their phenomenal impact in person, this film (and a fine blu-ray transfer) does a good job at giving us a hint. Likewise does Franco bring Ralston to life, with a very fine performance that never grates or feels Hollywood. He conveys the suffering, and the humor, well, and I believed him.<br /><br />But what really stands out about this film is Aron Ralston. Maybe most of us would have it in us to do what he did...but I doubt it. There are epic feats of endurance, and then there's cutting off part of your body by yourself and rappelling down a cliff in a desert and stumbling to safety. I like to think I could do it, but could I? That's the question this film and story raises, and I get a little edgy every time it comes to mind, as I still hike the high wilderness solo, without filing a flight plan. Part of me frankly enjoys the knowledge that one misstep and it might be curtains: life becomes heightened like never before, and the rewards are for me worth the risks. But then again, I don't climb in totally remote slot canyons. I've had a couple moments alone at 13,000 feet where death was a very real possibility, and they woke me up to a startlingly large extent, but trapped under a rock for four days in the desert? Not sure I could do what Ralston did. And watching this fine film of the feat, and knowing what steps the mind would have to take to get there? A vivid, deep experience, and I cried a couple times just thinking about how much our loved ones mean to us when the chips are down; Boyle's finest moments here are those dream sequences, and the connection with Trainspotting and other Boyle classics becomes clear. The man loves those who live way out on the edge, and he's not quick to moralize about the inherent dangers. He knows what it means to crave more, ever more, of what we love most.<br /><br />Which is why still some of us persist in risking it all for something magical that's out there: we want to become part of it. Which seems insane...until you've felt what's out there, and felt it stir what's in you. Then it makes sense, as much as it can. The human spirit demands adventure, new limits, stretched boundaries, and sometimes that leads to Aron Ralston's predicament. Which doesn't make him right or wrong, but just a person looking for more than most of us. And seeing as he's still climbing and loving the wilderness, it seems safe to say that, despite the high price, he continues to find it.<br /><br />There's a little gore here, but really very little, so don't let that dissuade you. What really matters in 127 is heart, and there's plenty of that in both this film and in Aron Ralston. Rarely has a real-life ending been more satisfying; now there's a kid who's going to see some beautiful places! Blessings to you and your family, brother.risks.

B004GGQMRY|5.0|Comment: This is one of those movies that you kind of stumble into. You have heard about it but forgot what it was you had heard. You see on the box that it is associated with 4 Academy Awards. It's raining (or snowing) outside so you decide to take a chance. Well... buy the end you have a warm feeling inside and you are glad you took the time to see the movie. Dustin Hoffman plays his part \\"most excellently\\". Tom Cruise plays \\"the strait man\\" and again \\"most excellently\\". If you haven't seen this movie, you could do yourself a favor. It is no in your face high tech action movie... just a good story about brothers. A GOOD story about brothers, enjoy.
B00475AYJQ|5.0|Finished this book last night.  I couldn't put it down.  An excellent read, and I can't wait for the next book.
B004DK5CW4|4.0|This is a beautiful movie. The animals as well as the scenery are magnificent. The story towards the middle bogs down a bit, but it ranks in the top 25 of all movies centered around animals in our book, and probably in the top 15. This is appropriate entertainment for your entire family.
B003C1QIO6|4.0|This is a mellow and nice CD.  I like to have something calm and easy to listen to as we're eating dinner, and I think this is great.
B003L20IFQ|1.0|Have been wanting to see this movie even though my friend warned me about it. When Amazon Instant Video offered it for 99 cents today, I just had to watch it.    The movie begins in darkness. We hear someone breathing. A lighter turns on. It is Paul Conroy (Ryan Reynolds), a man who is a truck driver in Iraq.  He is gagged around the mouth with cloth. He is inside an old wooden coffin and can not get out. Dirt is on the lid. He screams for help.  He is able to loosen the rope from his hands and ungag himself. He finds a cellphone by his feet. It is 6:12pm.   Able to get the cellphone, It is an Iraq phone. He calls 911. It is in Youngstown, Ohio. He calls Linda. She is not there. He calls the F.B.I. He also gets a call from a person that put him in there.    Can anyone believe him and help him?  Cast also includes the voice of Jose Luis Garcia Perez, Robert Paterson, Stephen Tobolowsky, Samantha Mathis, Ivana Mino, Warner Laughlin, Erik Palladino, Chris William Martin, Kali Rocha, Mary Songbird, Kirk Bailey, Anne Lockhart, Robert Clotworthy, Michalla Petersen, Juan Hidalgo, Abdelilah ben Massoo, Joe Guarneri, Heath Centazzu, Tess Harper.    I watched this movie on Amazon Instant Video On Demand. When you are done watching this movie, press ESC on your keyboard to go back to your normal screen.  You might also want to see [[ASIN:B003V19CKO 83 Hours Til Dawn]] (1990).
B003YFIUW8|3.0|When you first begin to read this book, the voice of the narrator will blow you away. Donoghue writes amazingly well from the point of view of the child. However, as the plot deepens, the narration gets a little tedious. In fact, I would say that the point of view ends up hindering the novel. And then there is the plot itself, which is somewhat empty. All in all, this was an entertaining read, and I would recommend to anyone to read at least the beginning (you'll certainly be hooked)!
1400079144|2.0|I did finish the book, and I do have to say that it did hold my interest at times, but there were several times that I put the book down in disgust because I think that Dan Brown in a better writer than this. There were just a lot of things that \\"brilliant\\" people, hopefully, would not do. The worst of which, in my opinion, was that Katherine, the brilliant scientist sister would have trusted someone that she met only that day, and invite them into her very expensive, exclusive, elusive laboratory.   I hope that the next Dan Brown book is better. It is my opinion that he is up to the task.
B002RL7W9W|3.0|my 5 year old son played with it once.  I helped him set them all up, and then he got bored, and we have to be careful b/c the parts are so TINY!!!!  it's ok, my son just isn't into it very  much.
B0036EBARO|5.0|Excellent album.  one of my favorite Goldfrapp albums.  its sad to see people rate it so low due to their personal musical preferences...truly its not for everyone.  the music is simply great, but in a very 80s way.
B0010SKUYM|5.0|The flashback sequences (most of the book) are fantastic and it never feels like something happens just because it will help the story. In fact the author points that out several times. \\"Now if this was a storybook, it would have happened like THIS, but...\\" or something like that. The sequences set in the present weren't as interesting mostly because they left so many unanswered questions. Really really good overall, though.
B001GKJ2E8|5.0|I am 66 years old and love action movies, westerns, vampire etc.  I thought this movie was great.  It had me talking to the TV etc.  I recorded it on my DVR but I will buy the movie to watch again so I can get the theater experience.
B00466HM28|4.0|Akai MPK Mini Review    MPC Pads: The MPC Pads on this unit are solid rubber. This means they can take quite the beating. They also light up which is purely for \\"looks\\". They can be assigned Notes, such as, C2, C3, D4 ECT.. In fl Studio you can set the MPC pads to play drum sounds, and have the keyboard play any Synth VST( all at the same time).. The pads are also Sensitive(the faster you hit, the louder);however the pads can not keep up with rapid hits.  I rate the pads a 4 out of 5    Key Board: The are springy, and feel cheap. They are also sensitive to speed.The keys feel they might break if you lift them up(why would you do this? On accident!). They also do not play any sound if you push it to slow. I rate them a 3 out of 5    Nobs: Perfect! 5 out of 5    Quality; This product feels like it will last 3 years, 5 if lucky. (if you don't drop it). It feels sturdy, but light. I am satisfied with this product.. THIS IS MY FIRST MIDI OR SYNTH>> I AM NEW TO MAKING MUSIC
B004EBT5CU|5.0|Outstanding album from a real artist.  Strong vocals with some catchy tunes combine to make a great album.  A fresh breathe of air in a music industry that is so infatuated with synthesized sounds and processed vocals. She has an incredible voice, and I for one am hoping she'll be around for many years to come. I highly recommend this one.
B002VX3RCW|5.0|I bought this toy for my son for Christmas when he was just about 6 months old. He LOVES it! This is his favorite toy by far. He is always chewing on Sir Prance A Lot's feet and loves the crinkly sound they make. This toy keeps him entertained for a long time! I am tempted to buy a second one just in case anything happens to the first.
B004HWR406|3.0|The rise of Zuckerberg and Facebook is an incredible story but the movie fell short in trying to capture it.
B004132HZS|5.0|I loved these 3 Sherlock mysteries. They take place in modern England but they have touches of the original in that, unlike all modern movies, there's no gigantic love angle. It's a pretty clean series, actually. No noticeable language, sex or drugs, so you can concentrate on the acting, the camera angles and the plot...The plots admittedly are not the best one could wish for, but entertaining enough.  The friendship between Sherlock and Watson is nicely done...I don't understand exactly why they dumped Watson's limp and title, but...not a biggie I guess.
B0000AK7AB|5.0|This dvd should be in every collection of great movies. We loved it the first time and  actually re-watch in at least once a year. Good old fashion love story between man and pig.
B000BB1MI2|4.0|I bought this for my wife who absolutely loves this movie and is a big fan of Johnny Depp.  She is very happy with the product and I'm sure will be watching the movie often.
B0047IIYQI|5.0|I bought the CD for M&S last year and I love it! They are very original. I received the deluxe edition and immediately listened to the live version. LOVE IT!! My favorite song is Dust Bowl Dance and the live version blew me away.
0671646788|4.0|Most all people think that getting a job and rising up the employment ladder is good, which it is.  Thinking Big give a whole new spin for entrepreneurs. The book explains when you think about starting a new business think nationally or globally.   I highly recommend this book along with The E-Myth by Michael Gerber.
0316098337|3.0|I was excited to read this book based on reader reviews and the subject sounded interesting (a \\"ripped-from-the headlines\\" type of story).  But I found this book kind of annoying, with few really interesting parts.  I didn't care for some aspects of the story being told from the young son (Jack's) perspective. The ways that Jack phrased many things and the ways he referred to things got kind of old.  The repetition of what they did each day was so long that it became boring, and while it did reinforce their extremely boring existence, it didn't make me want to keep reading more of the same thing.  I did find the parts involving Old Nick (the captor) pretty interesting, and when the escape became part of the story that also kept the story going.  But it stalled again after the escape and there were many pages still left.  Overall this book is over-hyped.
B001EN71DG|5.0|What a great set and I am totally happy with my purchase.  Once again Amazon comes through with a great product at a great price.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Wow. This is definatley my favorite book. I could not put it down. The first page got me hooked. I just finished reading all 3 of the hunger gaes books and i am astonished. worth my time and money. they will release a movie in March of 2012. i recomed these books to anybody who can read the english language. if you are old and dying read these books before you die. not a joke.
0670022411|4.0|I have just finished reading A Discovery of Witches yesterday and couldn't wait to write my review and share with you all how much I really enjoyed this.    I would not usually pick this genre but i'm so glad I did. Harkness has really captured my interest and I can't wait for the sequel...please let there be a sequel!!    Dr Diana Bishop renounced her witches heritage many years before, or so she thought, but her witches senses had never been too far away from her work or her life...even if she did not initially realise this. She is well credited in her field as a professer at Oxford and sometimes I struggled to understand the whole concept of the spellbound book 'Ashmole 782', luckily with the pace of the story line I was able to catch up quite quickly. Diana must learn more about the power she holds and develop her strengths in order to become the powerful witch she is destined to be.    Matthew Clairemont wastes no time sliding into Dianas life, but is it for all the right reasons? This is all revealed as the book goes on. An enegmatic Vampire who gains Dianas trust (a bit too quickly for such an inteligent woman). She is very soon in over her head with witches, vampires and daemons who have appeared in her world in order to find out the secrets held within Ashmole 782...Diana holds the key to where these creatures decended and their survival depends on this book.    So much time was spent developing the many secondary characters, which I suspect is due to the fact there is going to be a sequel, that at times I lost a bit of interest and hoped that the next page would reveal more of the plot to me. Now that I know all the characters I think the next book will actually reveal a real plot and not just a build up storyline. If it was a movie you would definatley be looking to watch part 2 immedaitely.    It is definatley worth sticking with this book and appreciating all the characters and the plights they each face in order for Diana and Matthew to be together ina wolrd that wants them to stay apart.
B004M6BQ9W|5.0|I was sorry I didn't see it in the movies on the big screen, I loved it, so much flair, and good story line, good music, good voices... whats not to say about this movie? I will watch it again in the future.
1449382673|5.0|The O'Reilly Head First Python is very well done and a valuable guide to get started with one of the hottest software development languages for taking advantage of the new forms of computing on the web.  I had already completed the Head First Programming book (which is also excellent) and wanted to learn more about Python programming.    What I enjoyed about both books is the highly interactive nature of the learning.  There are lots of examples that you build upon early in the book.  The examples quickly get into the more exciting areas of the web such as linking to social media platforms, accessing web content, and developing applications on cutting edge platforms like the Google App Engine (GAE).    The examples are fun and each one helps you build context to tackle more complicated problems.   I highly recommend this and Head First Programming as a way to get started with web and cloud based computing.  The book is excellent for a novice and also very useful for someone like me who has not programmed for 25 years and is just curious about this as a hobby.  O'Reilly publishing has continued to innovate in making technology accessible to the masses.
B0019N8P2W|5.0|We pre-ordered this set as soon as it was available on Amazon, and it doesn't disappoint. My wife and I loved this series when we were younger, and it still holds up. Who can resist this lovable deadpan snarker? Not me.
B00127RAJY|5.0|I've tried a lot of exercise DVDs, and hated them all.  I tried Jillian because a friend had gotten amazing results and suggested it.  For the price I figured, why not?  I ABSOLUTELY LOVE this DVD.  I'm still only on the first tier, but I can already feel the changes starting in my body after just a week.  My stamina getting through the work-out has improved already.      I love the way Jillian teaches.  She acknowledges that its hard, and she is NOT peppy, and omg isn't working out fun????  I have fibromyalgia, so a lot of repetitive movement is difficult for me, but I feel like just when its starting to be TOO uncomfortable, we switch to a new exercise.      I really am truly in love with this DVD, and I've been able to stick with it longer than any other program in the past.  AND I actually look forward to doing it.  Which isn't something I thought I would ever say!
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|Picks up right where the last left off. Best of the three books, in my opinion. All my questions about the characters were answered and I could not put it down.
1439102724|5.0|As an infertile 50-something mom of an adopted gay son, this book spoke to me so personally, it was as if Jodi was speaking directly to me! The questions posed by the religious right about homosexual activity (nature vs. nuture) are issues I've been over the last 10 years since my son came out to me. I was intrigued by the idea of music therapy, also, and want to research it more thoroughly now. Jodi has done again what her books usually do for me; help me make connections to my real world, while I live the struggle of each of her characters. I was transported back to my own encounter back in the early 80's with an IVF attempt that did not succeed, to the joy I experienced when my husband and I were finally able to adopt a sweet, smart, loving little boy; and the confusion and fear of a mom who worries that her gay son will encounter all the prejudices and evil that people can muster out of ignorance and their own fear. Thanks for a compelling read, Jodi - keep up the great work! This is definitely my book club's read when I host in June!
B0001UL7RY|5.0|This is a great cd. It is obviously the best album she had before she released, \\"Goodbye Lullaby.\\" The lyrics, vocals, and sound are all great. Really great effort put into this album. 5/5!
B000U618C8|5.0|I find it marvelous that Mr.Gonzalez was able to drop an album more than a few years after his first that sounded so remarkably similar. And you know what? The similarity is fantastic. His vocals may be emphasized a bit more on \\"In Our Nature\\" than his debut \\"Veneer\\", but the combination of his lyrics, the mellow and haunting acoustic guitar, and other miscellaneous sounds yet again makes for one amazing record. Buy this with no regrets. You won't be able to stop listening.
B000002I77|4.0|Althought I don't really love the funky sound, I find this album to be brilliant. The guitars are outstanding and Jan Hammer on the keys is really on fire. Naturally the drums are  perfect, as usual.
0061562408|5.0|This is a great love story in so many ways.  If you've ever wondered what went on in a dog's head, this could give you an inking.  I recommend this to dog lovers and nondog lovers alike.
B00006JDVV|5.0|I don't mean to say this is the greatest movie of all time, because its not.  I went to film school and have seen a lot of movies in my time, but for some reason this one I can just watch on repeat and it always makes me happy, not to say that this is exactly a happy film.  It brings me hope in the ability of the human race to be itself.  We are a waring people, and even though the Christian Bale Character is far from it, there is still this battle readiness that he has to rise to because that is what the world expects of men.  The American seems to have scared off some viewers as either being unrealistic/ because no one saw warriors as being that all or nothing viking types, or too scary because humans are the worse evil of all according to some points.  I admit that this movie did not reach for the stars, but what makes this movie for me is all the little details.  I love the ways the dragons were handled in this film.  I thought there would be more from the way that the trailors made it look, and I remember teh first screening thinking about it, but that fades in subsequent viewings because there are all these moments, like the star wars retelling, with live stage actors.  Star wars is an amalgimation of Greek and Japanese stories retold from a land far far away, but when all the texts books that would have gone away, the story gets recreated.  I know that to a lot of scholars this is a travesty for human history, but I think its what most would pass on, similarly to how the dragon myths got passed down.  I think that everyone behaves realistically, especially the dragons, which seem to have a team of biologists considering every art choice for the film.  This movie is about survival and it does make me hopeful to human strenths.
B004M54NWU|5.0|Thought this was a very heartfelt film. All you heard about it was all the nudity but really the important part was how moving it really was. made me cry made me laugh. I loved it all.
0525423273|5.0|\\"Anna\\" is such a refreshing change to a lot of the YA that is popular right now. No vampires or werewolves, just a simple story of an American girl in *swoon* Paris trying to discover who she is and how she feels.   I am 29 but could not stop squirming and giggling as I read. Remembering what it was like to have crushes on boys, hoping they like you back but also not wanting to lose a friend. Imagining walking the streets of Paris with a beautiful boy...I think that would make any woman's heart jump!  Everyone in the story is so real and genuine. These are the friends you had growing up - or if you are young, the friends you have right now and a lot of the problems you actually face. If you don't fall in love with the characters or the story then you will surely fall in love with Stephanie's description of Paris as seen through the eyes of a 17 year old girl for the first time.  Now don't get me wrong, I am a fan of wizards and boarding schools with moving staircases, but reading about the magic of love, of Paris, of the real world...I think it meant more to me. I would definitely recommend this book for anyone and am buying another copy for my 16 year old cousin!
B004DK5CW4|3.0|[[ASIN:B004DK5CW4 Secretariat]]  For the horse racing fan, especially those who enjoy the Kentucky Derby, this bio-pic of a great horse is very entertaining.  The family issues while very real are dramatically slow.  In all, this film is appropriate for the whole family to watch together. It entertains, teaches historical fact and offers family value discussions, while giving the racing fan some great race scenes and the history of a great horse.
B000MZHW40|5.0|\\" People were made to be loved, things were made to be used. The problem of our world today is that people are being used and things are being loved\\"<br /><br />The Quote mentioned above is a perfect motto/message for what this movie stands for. Diamonds have been known to be found in certain parts of Africa. Big Companies, Establishments, Business men etc ... All have set up an eye to get the best of Diamonds in order to sell it for the rich and willing therefore making themselves one of the richest people in the world. But Diamond trading is more than just an 'honorable' Business, in a matter of fact its far from being 'honorable'. Sometimes people will do anything to get these stones, the wealth and fortune it brings with it even killing and turning against their own blood.<br /><br />Solomon Vandy (Djimon Hounsou) like many other Native Africans lives a poor living as a fishermen but he's a simple man and a caring family man who has an Optimistic view on life as long as he have his family around and can provide the basic needs to survive nothing in the world should matter much 'even the political and the constant war troubles in Africa'. However life turns upside down for him, once the rebels \\"RUF\\" attack his village they not only burn his house and held him captive they also separate him from his family and soon enough he finds himself in a camp digging for diamonds in order to sponsor weapons for the anti-government who were the source of his misery. While he is digging he finds a 'large' and 'rare' diamond, In it Solomon sees his 'possible' escape from the camp so he buries it secretly where no one can find it.<br /><br />Danny Archer (Leonardo DiCaprio) is a white - African ex soldier who works currently as a diamond smuggler for one of the biggest Diamond Companies on the market. However in exchange for some money and Military protection Danny has sold his soul to the devil, he is also under the threat of getting shot and killed everyday enough to make him tire of his life. So, he wants to get out of Africa and go somewhere else, a place where he don't have to kill and get shot at constantly a place where he can be at 'peace' However to do that he needs the money.<br /><br />Maddy Bowen (Jennifer Connelly) is an American Journalist who is investigating the Diamond trade in Africa or what's also known as the 'Blood Diamond' trade and is seeking the truth, she is sure that there is some illegal activities involving the Diamond Business but the problem is she got no proof to back up her story.<br /><br />The three meet and they all need each other to get what they want or to achieve a purpose. Solomon wants his family and old life back again but he can't do it without the help of Danny Archer who is willing to help him if and only if he would lead him to the Rare Diamond he buried, However he too can't do this without the help of Mandy Bowen who as a journalist has access to certain places but she also has a price in return she wants Danny to provide her with information and documents about the 'hidden truth' involving the Diamond business.<br /><br />This movie is Emotional and really gripping. I Like it when Hollywood makes Strong Movies like that who explain the hardship of life and Open the eyes of people to what's really happening in the world and how Greed has filled some souls with hatred and bitterness as well as destructed other people's lives.<br /><br />The Acting was superb also. You got amazing performances from the lead actors. Its really easy to see why Leonardo DiCaprio has gotten an Oscar nomination for this role, I thought it was well-deserved even if he lost but hey not all spot lights are shined on DiCaprio Djimon Hounsou does an Excellent job at playing the native African American who is just like many others a mere Victim in a cruel world.<br /><br />I really enjoyed this movie. Its much more than I expected. So believe the reviews they are true and not Overrated.<br /><br />Another Similar Movies Irecommend :<br />[[ASIN:B000NIVJF4 The Last King of Scotland (Widescreen Edition)]]descreen Edition)]]
B0036S4C6G|4.0|\\"Time's a goon right? Isn't that the expression?\\" Jules had drifted over from across the room. \\"I've never heard that... time is a goon?\\"<br /><br />A Visit from the Goon Squad<br />Apparently so. Which makes Time and the passing of it the very loose theme that loosely weaves this quirky, rock n roll laden book into coherency. Listed time and time again on numerous reviewers' and authors Top Reads for 2010 (many of them found on the very necessary Book Site The Millions - like here and here ), usually incorporating the words; punk rock, drugs and rock and roll, 1970s music and washed up punk rockers - and the attraction was instant.<br /><br />Unlike many books that try to set themselves against a backdrop of a nostalgic musical era, The Goon Squad was a compelling, quirky, sometimes uncomfortable read. Structured as a series of short stories, the central characters each have the voice of protagonist, as the story zig zags through time, the speaker's identity not always immediately clear, clues as to the existence or age of children, state of marriage or mind the indicative clues.<br /><br />At the centre of this time shifted story is Bennie Salazar, once a 1970s Punk Rocker, in the present, a washed up producer struggling on both the musical and matrimonial front. From there the stories spiral outwards, taking in Sasha - his kleptomaniac assistant, Scotty - the once musically talented, now virtually homeless trash collector, Dolly the tortured publicist, Kitty the B grade celebrity... and the list goes on.<br /><br />As time lurches backwards and forwards, from the early hay days of playing punk rock and slam dancing, through turbulent twenties and thirties of broken love and friendships, drug and mental abuse through to the misery and acceptance of middle age, we follow and slowly warm to these broken characters as they fight off the tyranny of the inevitable Goon Squad that is time.<br /><br />With an ending that will please any true music fan, this should get a look in for your top reads of 2011. And if you're accused of being late to the party - just blame it on the Goon Squad.<br /><br />\\"Time's a Goon right? You gonna let that Goon push you around?\\" Scotty shook his head \\"The Goon won\\"<br /><br />Robot Rating: 9/10 (and yet another contender for Top 5 Books of the Year)you're accused of being late to the party - just blame it on the Goon Squad.    \\"Time's a Goon right?

B004AHNIGM|5.0|Most of the songs are covers so minus half a star. However, the selection is nicely suited to Gregg's voice which has never sounded better. This CD is refreshingly a little different from the usual Allman Brothers sound. In light of the poor efforts put forth lately by some of the other old greats, this CD is tastefully done and a real pleasure to listen to. A close second to his fine 'Searching for Simplicity' CD. Well worth it - thanks Gregg!

B002LB8U26|5.0|Have never been a big fan of romantic dramas, yet CITY OF ANGELS is an exception. The premise of this [[ASIN:B00005JKI7 WINGS OF DESIRE]] (1987) remake: there's unseen angels among us who escort our souls to their next existence when we die. These ethereal beings are not necessarily trapped for all time in a netherworld of subservancy to the living.<br /><br />Seth (Cage) is one such spirit. He watches surgeon Maggie Rice (Ryan) trying to desperately save a man that he's come for, sees her look right at (and through) him when she fails, and instantly falls deeply in love with the lady. Seth follows and eventually makes himself visible to the chronically insomniac Maggie; he longs to be able to touch, to comfort and to be with her.<br /><br />When Seth discovers that another of her patients, Mr. Messenger (Franz) is a fallen angel who chose to become mortal so he could marry and have a family, he must decide on either eternal life alone or a finite one with Maggie. The choice seems obvious to Seth but cruel fate intervenes. This love story has an incredibly sad and ironic ending.<br /><br />The always compelling Andre Braugher, fresh from [[ASIN:B002BLNGTS HOMICIDE: LIFE ON THE STREET]], has an interesting small role as a fellow spirit. His fixed, big-eyed stare makes it clear that angels never blink. (Nick Cage has extended scenes where he keeps his eyelids from fluttering.)

B00004CZPF|5.0|Two of his best concerts ever. While Tubular Bells II is great, Tubular Bells III is out of this world. I would have given anything to be out in that audience, rain or no rain. The only downside to this DVD is that is region coded for Europe, so I can only play it on my laptop; unless I want to go out and buy a non-region coded player. I looked for a long time, trying to find one coded for the US, but this product was never coded for the US region.
B002ZG9774|3.0|BURLESQUE had some fantastic choreography and music and what was there, should have been enough to make this a memorable movie for years to come. Yet, the choreography and movement and design of those numbers was ruined by an editor that tried to get too cutesty with his editing skills. Every 3 second and every drum beat, there's an edit, or a different angle, not just on one or two numbers, but every single musical number is edited like they came from the MTV school of editing. Not to mention, they would cut away from numbers to do montage moments of storyline which was really unnecessary.<br /><br />BURLESQUE has its problems with story, like the fact that Ali (Christina Aguilera), goes from being an Iowa diner waitress to Los Angeles without needing a single moment of practice or trials in order to be as good as the girls who are already performing. We the audience are just supposed to believe that she is just one of those few people in the world who don't have to work at it, their just plain good. Sorry, even Christina Aguilera didn't become Christina Aguilera without some work and struggles.<br /><br />The script is pretty vanilla as well, which makes it even worse that they took up moments of dance and music to break away from what was happening on stage to show us montages of pointless stuff, like Aguilera sleeping, or Cher talking about her mortgage paying woes. All of which was covered adequately enough with dozens of other scenes.<br /><br />Bottom line though, people came into BURLESQUE wanting to see the singing and dancing, and what was there was exceptional if you don't get nautious with the rapidfire editing and the moments of conversation or montages that break up the performances.  The creators of BURLESQUE and the editor of BURLESQUE got overly creative and should have just let the music and dancing do the talking, instead of trying to spruce up already great numbers with spastic editing.

B0041KKYEW|5.0|There aren't many words to describe Black Swan. The only ones I have been able to come up with are beautiful, thrilling, haunting, and delirious.  From the moment the Fox Searchlight intro began rolling until the end credits I was completely captivated by this film. The way the plot shadowed the basic summary of the Swan Lake ballet was done very well. It was one of those moves where the outcome is given to you in the theatrical trailer if you can catch it; \\"I had the craziest dream last night about a girl who was turned into a swan, but her prince falls for the wrong girl and she kills herself.\\"  Natalie Portman shined as Nina in ways I didn't think she could. I have been a fan of Natalie for many years and this was by far one of the best, if not the best, performances I have ever seen from her. Her ballet skill surprised me and you could tell she really did train to make herself appear like a true professional dancer. Her transformation from a \\"white swan\\" image to that of a \\"black swan\\" was phenomenal. I truly believed that her spin into absolute madness and her loss of reality was real. I couldn't imagine anyone else winning the Academy Award. Natalie deserved it 100% and I hope those curious to see why she won do so. Truly a great, dedicated performance.   The symbolism was marvelous; the scratches on Nina's back, the bleeding fingers, the feather-like barbs in her skin, the bloodshot eyes, etc.. The barbs served as a reflection of Nina losing her grip on being a \\"white swan.\\" It wasn't until the dance of the black swan that we saw the barbs turn into feathers completely transforming her into the swan. And although it took me by surprise the sexual aspect also fit in with the symbolism. The director's instruction was for Nina to touch herself and try and free her innocent perception and mindset. You see as the plot progresses Nina becoming more comfortable being seductive and sexual with herself and, as it turns out, with Mila Kunis' character, Lily. As shocking as the scenes were they did flow with the plot perfectly. If they would have been toned down and/or excluded the film would not have been the same.   The musical score was fantastic, as well. It had main elements of Tchaikovsky and the original ballet but was a little twisted. As a fan of classical music, and Tchaikovsky in general, I was very pleased with what Clint Mansell did with it.  I love the way Black Swan had glimpses of the horror genre. It isn't horror in the way of being a typical slasher flick but the psychological aspect makes this film truly creepy and it keeps you on the edge of your seat. I got goosebumps quite a few times while watching this movie. Absolutely chilling and brilliant. I can't wait to own it.

1878424319|5.0|I just purchased my third copy of The Four Agreements.  The first two copies were either lent or given to others. It is, indeed, a practical guide to personal freedom. You learn that you must be honest with yourself and with others; you learn to not take things personally; you learn that other people have issues that are not related to their relationship with you.  I suggest this book to everyone who wants to be more at peace with their relationships with others.
B001PB3RU8|5.0|This is not what I was expecting at all - I was frankly expecting something boring - with slow ballad after ballad, but instead Florence + the Machine sincerely surprised me. I love the music, and I just kept thinking throughout about how amazing her voice is. Of course, naturally one's singing voice is an instrument, but she uses hers on another level. Her voice is amazing! This album rocks (literally and figuratively)! I highly recommend this album!

I don't know much about this singer. I know only that her voice has deepened, become smokier, her delivery more impassioned since her Grammy-winning,\\"19.\\"  She has a powerful voice, with incredible range, that adapts to virtually any genre. As author or co-author of many songs, she tells a story with each verse, and communicates joy, suffering, contrition or healing with each note.    I am old by the standards of this industry. I'm not \\"the demographic\\" Sony/BMG expects; but I love this album. One listen to \\"Someone Like You\\" and I was a goner.      \\"21\\" proves that an album can be a huge commercial success, and a work of art, too.

B004G6009K|5.0|I was really skeptical when I sat down to watch 'Tangled' with my 6 year old daughter, as I feel the quality of Disney movies has really, really gone down since The Lion King came out in 1994.  There were the rare exceptions like Mulan in 1998 and the incredible Lilo & Stitch in 2002, but overall the glory days of Disney were in the past.  I heard that 'Tangled' had gotten great reviews, and man were those reviews right!!!<br /><br />This isn't just a good movie, but a GREAT one that excels in all areas which are important with 1 small exception:<br /><br />- animation is some of the greatest I have ever seen, it's absolutely gorgeous<br />- story is fresh and new, a great new spin on an old story<br />- score is spot on throughout<br />- voice acting is exceptional<br /><br />The only caveat I have is that the songs were very good, just not on the level with the Lion King, but this isn't a fair critique.<br /><br />I have no qualms with recommending this movie to EVERYONE.  A rare CGI movie that has a feel that isn't CGI and another gem that is on the same level as Pixar.  With great movies like this and Dreamworks 'How to Train Your Dragon', Pixar finally has some really competition, something that only is a win win win for the consumer!!<br /><br />***** HIGHLY RECOMMENDED

B001OQCV6A|1.0|I have a suggestion, which, I'm certain, someone may have voiced before: to allow \\"negative stars\\" - maybe red or black ones. For some \\"products,\\" so bluntly tasteless, one star just don't cut it.  I always tell to those \\"modernizers:\\" get your own story! You want to create another Jackie Chan style flick, where characters go on banging each other with baseball bats - go on, there's no crime in that.  But why mutilate the work of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, why smear the image of Sherlock Holmes, who is dear and important to the millions around the world.   Some say: avoid this movie, like a plague. I say, don't just ignore it. Protest actively! Classic writers of the past created immortal images for us. They have been nurturing generations of readers.  Demanding respect, protecting their work from \\"martial-art-ization\\" and \\"shao-linization\\" is the very least we can do for them.  Hands off the Baker Street!
0307272702|5.0|After having read a previous book by this author, I followed his advice and lost 50 pounds within two months, with dramatic improvements in my cholestoral profile and general health.  He is clearly correct, both based on the evidence he cites and personal experience.  This is an extremely important book.  I also highly recommend his prior book, though it is much more detailed and requires more effort.

0756404738|5.0|Patrick Rothfuss' writing in this book is absolutely amazing, it has a great flow and is just written so well. His writing is so addictive, I literally couldn't stop reading. The one night I actually didn't sleep, so I could just keep reading. The characters have amazing depth, even ones that aren't too important. The world is very original, and the story telling surrounding it breathed life into the world.     For criticism, the book is a little slow at times, and Rothfuss makes some very confusing/annoying choices in the story. At one point, Kvothe skips this whole section that sounded pretty awesome when he was shipwrecked, and a whole trial. Kvothe explains why he does this, but it doesn't explain why Rothfuss does this. He skips action/story heavy sections that could have taken up a hundred pages and takes a lot of time writing about every little detail about mediocre/boring events. I can only hope that Rothfuss might write some short stories to fill in the blanks. My only other complaint is that the characters sometimes feel very stubborn and stupid, while this does make them real, it can still be annoying. Most of the time I was okay with their choices but at one specific point I really felt like it was artificial, just a way to move on with the story. Specifically when he parted ways with the Maer and his new wife Lady Lackless. Also regarding the Lackless chick, the foreshadowing is pretty heavy that she is Kvothe's aunt, but they seem completely oblivious to it. I mean, she hates the Adema Ruh because her sister ran off and married one of them leaving her old life behind (which is exactly what his mother did). Also when Kvothe first meets her, he says her face looks really familiar but he can't put his finger on why (again because she looks like his mother). So either I'm crazy, or that is one of the plot points for the third book. Also I wish that Kvothe would go visit his old mentor from the beginning of the first book, it seems like that character has completely disappeared.     My last complaint is that again, there isn't a beginning middle and end to this book. It's just a continuation of Kvothe's story, or it could even be seen as an anthology of a series of short stories about the adventures of Kvothe. While this works for Kvothe telling the story in that world, it's very annoying for people reading the books in this world, especially if Rothfuss is going to take another 5 years to write the third book. In the end, the wait will be worth the masterpiece he's writing, but it still sucks. I'll probably just have to read them again before the new release so I remember everything (I did it this time and it worked pretty well).    Now onto something that didn't have anything to do with Rothfuss, but instead his publisher. I would have loved to read this on my kindle, but because the price was absolutely ridiculous for the ebook I instead bought the hardcover version. I understand that the hardcover price on Amazon isn't the list price. However, the publisher should realize that at what they priced the ebook, it would be less than a dollar cheaper than the hardcover. Who in their right mind would buy it? Personally, I won't buy any ebook priced higher than the list price of a paperback, which means eight dollars. Furthermore, I will never ever ever ever buy any ebook priced higher than ten dollars, I absolutely refuse. I mean there is absolutely zero production cost in an ebook, they should never price it so high. Hopefully the publishers recognize this and change their strategy.     So in closing, everyone that enjoys Fantasy should read this book, in fact I think anyone that likes a good story should read the Kingkiller Series. While the world is very fantasy based, the story itself in genre defying, and should resonate with everyone. I absolutely loved the book, and now I'm depressed because I have to find something else to read that will most likely pale in comparison. :)
0811729117|5.0|Carius tells like he saw it in the war years.  This is a unique perspective on the tank battles of WWII.  I may be wrong, but I believe that there are no other books written by Tiger commanders.  Perhaps Willi Fey could be counted, but that is more about other tankersand less biographical.<br /><br />This book is an absolute must for anyone interested in the history of the Tiger tank.  It includes some great photographs.
B004DMNT2W|4.0|I was really looking forward to getting this camcorder case, but I was a bit disappointed when I got it.  I expected my Canon ZR960 to fit into the case; it looked large enough to accommodate the camcorder.  However, it wasn't.  It's more for a Flip-type camera; those would fit in very nicely indeed.<br /><br />The case itself is wonderfully made.  The stitching is solid, straight, and even.  The zipper is heavy duty, and the strap is solidly made.  It has a velcro attachment, which I always am a bit leery of; I always worry that the thing is going to fall off at just the wrong time.<br /><br />For a small video camera, this would be a great case.  It's padded and would hold a Flip with no problem.  There would be room enough to store a few memory sticks and other do-dads in there with no problem.<br /><br />Just don't expect to get your small miniDV camcorder in there.  It just won't fit, as I found out.  As far as the roomy attribute, I marked it down because of my expectations; it could easily be five stars if you put a small camera in there.
B0017JKEL8|5.0|Intelligently written, thoughtfully cast, brilliantly art directed - and hugely metaphorical.  The various DVD sets are a huge treat because you can watch one episode after another and the DVD extras are as intelligent and thoughtful as the show itself.
B002JH3TW8|5.0|I have two of these cables to support some older 400 FireWire drives on new Apple hardware with 800 FireWire ports.  These work flawlessly.  The connectors and cable material are high quality.  There may be some older equipment that may not be supported as suggested in other reviews, but read the specs by Moshi and the specs for your equipment.  Pin out could play into whether there is support for a specific device.  For the reports that reference \\"it broke\\", I cannot imagine the quality of this cable adapter being subject to breakage unless you drive your truck over it.  Great cable.

B008Y768XO|5.0|I knew when I began watching this movie that I had seen it before but it had been a long time.  I am in love with this movie.  I love dogs but this story is amazing.  The loyalty and love this dog has for his owner is so special.  I would certainly recommend this movie.
B0034G4P7Q|5.0|So many times we hear about a great film and how it's the best thing ever! Only to be left so disappointed by yet another over rated movie, however The Social Network does not fall into that category, because yes the critics praise has been worthy, The Social Network is one of the best films to come along in quite a while!     The first thing to say is that this is not a film about Facebook, yes its based around its creators Mark Zuckerberg and Eduardo Saverin, but what it really is about is how their invention came between their friendship. The way the film is set up works really well as far as story telling goes, Mark Zuckerberg played by the brilliant Jesse Eisenberg is involved in 2 cases at once, one involving co creator Eduardo Saverin played by Andrew Garfield and the other case involves Cameron Winklevoss and Tyler Winklevoss who claim they asked Zuckerberg to design a social networking site for Harvard and claim that Zuckerberg took their idea. Eduard Saverin is also involved in that case.     It says alot for a movie that features a lot of dialogue that The Social Network never becomes confusing, boring or hard to follow. This is helped brilliantly by Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross amazing score for the film. Director David Fincher(seven, fight club, zodiac) really brings out the best in all the scenes and to listen to his commentary on the film is amazing.     The Blu Ray comes packed with extras such as Fincher's Commentary as well as screenplay writer Aaron Sorkin along with the cast. On disc 2 there's a brilliant feature called How Did They Ever Make A Movie of Facebook? Its over one and half hours long and shows a great insight on how they made the movie including the difficulties that they had to over come, it also show what a great director Fincher is. It shows him and Sorkin discussing what they think would work better in different scenes. You also get Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross talking about the creation of the award winning score and how toughit was to recreate \\"In The Hall Of The Mountain\\" for the famous Henley Royal Regatta scene, they include two versions, one that made the movie and an earlier version that didn't.     The Social Network is a film you will come back to watch more than once, it features a great cast even Justin Timberlake playing Napster Founder Sean Parker plays his role very well. It really is one of the best films to come along in a while and you will not be disappointed!

B0034JGBM0|4.0|Now everybody knows Jack White can be a little bit different but there's no doubt about his talent whether it be with The White Stripes, The Racounteurs or latest band the Dead Weather however how much do we actually know about the other half of The White Stripes, drummer and some time vocalist Meg White? Its safe to say all we really know is that she used to be married to Jack and is married now to Patti Smiths son. So with this new documentary Under Great White Northern Lights do we suddenly get to know her better and find out what she's really like. Well the answer is NO but this documentary and live cd are well worth purchasing anyway     Filmed live on the Canadian leg of their 2007 tour for their album Icky Thump, we follow The White Stripes around on their tenth anniversary tour as they do things like play the worlds shortest gig(only Jack White could pull something like that off)Jack who is a keen bowler has them play in a bowling alley, on a boat as well as a on a moving bus! However its the relationship(or lack of) between Jack and Meg thats the real selling point of this documentary. Meg is really shy and you can tell she does not like being followed around by the camera. Of course after this Canadian tour they cancelled their US leg of the tour as Meg was suffering from acute anxiety so are we really watching Meg meltdown before our very eyes? One of the highlights is when Meg break down in tears as Jack performs White Moon in the studio.     The documentary is wonderfully shot in black and white with a hint of red by film maker Emmett Malloy, the live footage is great and shows what a great live band they have become and shows how that two people playing can be as just as loud as a full 5 or 6 piece band. It leaves you wanting to see them live again sooner rather than later.     The cd features 16 songs recorded from the same tour and dips in to their expansive back catalogue but it's really the excellent documentary that's the selling point!

0545265355|5.0|In a dark and foreboding future, Katness' father dies in a mining accident leaving the family destitute. The teen must hunt to feed her family.  But hunting is illegal and she is in mortal danger. Then the unimaginable happens. Katness' sister, Prim, is choosen for the HUNGER GAMES. The annual event that pits two children from each of the twelve districts to a fight to the death. For in this gladiator style event - there can be only one victor. Katness steps forward to take her twelve-year-old sister's place and the story accelerates into a whirling maelstrom of deadly weapons, fiendish arena traps, and high fashion.<br />.<br />The story has many twists and turns as we follow Katness on her adventures.  Told in first person present tense, Collins grabs the reader at the first page and never lets go.  I spent many a midnight hour reading this amazing trilogy.  Collins's narrative is compelling and the world she spins echoes a future that we might share.<br /><br />The trilogy is PG for graphic violence but most young readers see much worse on broadcast TV. Boys will enjoy the male characters and Katness, but the girls will love it for the devotion to the feminine in a world that kills its own children.

B000B5XOYI|3.0|Okay we all know that by the time they got to making Batman & Robin (Batman IV)it was just a total shambles.  But, these are all \\"Special Edition\\" versions (2 Disc Sets) which means loads of extras (about 18 hours worth to be exact!).  Granted, if these were single disc editions I would probably only get the first two movies individually.    I say wait for the price to drop to around the $20 - $25 mark and the snap it up.  The extras do make it worth while.

B003VPWXRO|5.0|Portia deRossi's book is the most accurate account of what it's actually like to struggel with anorexia that I've ever read. She details everything from her diet, to her workouts to the grave effect that her diet had on her body, and also the long hard road to recovery. I have read this book front to back 4 times already. So well written; you can feel a true emotional connection to her experiences.
0756404738|5.0|In short:  If you liked the first, you will probably like this one as well.  They are both great.    What I like most I think is that the story really focuses on Kvothe.  This is hard to find in epics this size...usually readers are tortured with 8-20 different characters, most of whom are just irritating interruptions or \\"plot development\\".  I hate this.  When you have a good character, why is it a bad thing to stick with them the whole book?  I love the first person perspective, and the fact that Mr. Rothfuss doesn't mind skipping over some bits to continue the story at a better pace.  If he says it wasn't worth going into (such as his first boat trip), who am I to argue?    Thanks for a great book.  Very enjoyable.

The young men were scared but they still did their job.<br />War is bad no matter what.<br />This is a movie you must watch, to see how scared these kids were but yet they did what they had to do to survive.<br />I give this movie 5 stars.
B000054OTY|3.0|This edition of \\"One-Eyed Jacks,\\" by Echo-Bridge Entertainment, appears in general video quality pretty much identical, if not entirely identical, to the edition released by Brentwood Home Video \\"Exclusively Distributed by BCI Eclipse LLC\\" as part of a four-video collection entitled \\"Legends of the West.\\" One difference is that this Echo-Bridge edition gives more vidoo chapter options but also, unforgiveably, starts the movie a few notes into Friedhoffer's magnifican musical score, which is a bit like starting Beethoven's Fifth Symphony a few notes in.  There is some color washout in a scene early on with Brando, Malden,etc.ins ide the bank, but otherwise, except for video purists, it is certainly much better than not having this masteriece at all.  If you can find the \\"Legends of the West\\" collection (which also includes \\"The Sundowners\\", set in Australia, with Robert Mitchum; \\"The Big Trees,\\" with Kirk Douglas; and \\"Vengeance Valley,\\" with Burt Lancast, if things like cutting off the first notes of a magnificanet score drive you nuts, you'd be better off with the \\"Legends of the West\\" collection if you find it.  Surely \\"One-Eyed Jacks\\" deserves a restoration and since it is reportedly Martin Scorsese's favorite western, perhaps one day he might shell out the fortune to restore this classic.  However, other than annoyingly cutting off the first notes of the score, this appears to contain the movie though with the aforementioned color washout in the bank scene.  It is a truly magnificent movie with awesome performances by Brandon, Malden, Ben Johnson, Slim Pickens, Karty Jurado, Pina Pellecer, and all the rest.  If you like Brando in this, be sure to look him up in \\"The Appaloosa,\\" which, to my knowledge, is the only other western featuring him as the protagonist.  (He is a villain in \\"The Missouri Breaks\\" with Jack Nicholson as the ptortagonist.)  For Karl Malden doing another great villain perfromance in a western, don't miss \\"Nevada Smith\\" with Steve McQueen, Brian Keith, Martin Landau as a heavy, and Susanne Pleshette.

B00127RAJY|5.0|A week into this video workout and I could already see results! My arms weren't as flabby, my inner thighs didn't touch as much, it is truly amazing. I've tried Tae Bo, various fad diets and programs, but Jillian is true and real... it's pure no-nonsense exercise! Truly inspiring and within about a week I lost 3 pounds. I haven't finished with the program, but as soon as I get close to the end of April, I will post full results. You have to try it, I bought it for four bucks and I haven't seen this improvement on my body in this short period of time.
B001DTPZNY|4.0|I know this one's gotten some bad reviews, professional and amateur alike, but I'd like to say a few words on its behalf.<br /><br />I agree that the plot is a little far-fetched, to start.  I can't deny that.  Mind-control?  Psy warfare?  Aliens from another dimension?  You could have justly titled it Indiana Jones and the Crazy Plot, I admit.  However, most of that comes in near the end, at which point you're hopefully already happily settled into the wild adventure, frantic chases, plot twists, father-son bonding, more chases, and typical Indy humor which this film is chock-full of.<br /><br />The entire opening transition, from kids in a hot rod to a race with military vehicles (my family used to OWN a Ford like that, I swear!), to the revelation about who the \\"military\\" folks really were, to Indy's appearance, to the Area 51 warehouse, to the alien, and finally through the incredible sequence with the nuclear test has to be one of the best (if not THE best) Indy openings ever.  And it all somehow blends together!  Great editing.  Who could fail to be amused by the familiar gleam of gold in that OTHER crate at the warehouse (tip of the fedora to the first film), or the rocket-sled ride, or Indy's \\"Oh, this can't be good at all!\\" at the test site, to the landing of the flying fridge?  Great, great stuff.<br /><br />The lengthy sequence at college beginning with the all-too-serious looming threat of McCarthyism and ending with the fantastic motorcycle chase also had many great moments.  Being chased by the KGB through an anti-Communist rally?  And what about the kid in the library asking Professor Jones, lying next to motorcycle on floor, a question about his Anthro homework?  Terrific.  I was impressed by Shia LeBoeuf as his son, he somehow managed to suggest what a real offspring of Indy and Marion would be like.<br /><br />And Marion herself...so great to see Karen Allen back in an Indy movie.  The resolution of their abruptly-terminated relationship through a series of spats and back to the old love and affection was a really heartwarming aspect to the movie, as well as a funny one.  I admit I had a little sympathy for their Russian guard who begged them to \\"Shut up!\\" in the back of the truck.<br /><br />The entire action sequence on the way to Akator, racing through the jungle on a variety of vehicles and using a variety of weapons on one another, was another action high-point.  A swordfight between people in two high-speed vehicles?  What about the wonderful Cate Blanchett as Irina Spalko wielding her sword against Mutt, criticizing his technique as that of a \\"young man eager to start but finishing too soon?\\"  Cate was definitely a fine villain and a high point of the film as well.<br /><br />I'll admit that things became a bit more absurd and confused near the end (surviving THREE falls from waterfalls?  The endless crosses, double-crosses, and triple-crosses of his buddy Mac?  The whole \\"interdimensional beings with a flying saucer\\" concept?), you can't deny it was a wild finish.  The postscript, the wedding (finally!) between Indy and Marion, was a nice conclusion, finishing the film on an up-note.<br /><br />I still put this film third, behind the first film and \\"Last Crusade,\\" but I put it close behind those two and WAY ahead of the ridiculous \\"Temple of Doom.\\"  Well-worth seeing, whatever the purists say about it.back to the old love and affection was a really heartwarming aspect to the movie, as well as a funny one.

B004GNFSO0|1.0|I love history.  I love stories about overcoming obstacles against overwhelming odds.  I thought this book would be one to add to my list.  I will say this, I finished the book against my own obstacles of the obvious errors against truth. First, the author was not part of such a team.  We was released from Russia well after he states that this had taken place.  That started my slow, but steady disregard for this book.  The character, as I will call him, would be humbled by this experience.  However, anytime something positive takes place, he is the one responsible for the outcome.  The opposite is true when a negative situation occurs, it is always the fault of the other members. Almost everything is glaringly wrong.  Yes, the Russians were bad.  Yes, they sent millions of people to their death.  Yes they used to torture, but that is pretty much where the accuracy ends.  If you can get past the issues and look at this book at a purely literary stand point it is tolerable.
B004DK49DW|5.0|It may be that I am a long time dedicated Social D fan, but like a good bottle of wine, this band gets better with age. Many of the songs that I heard over the past couple years at live events are on the album. Mike Ness and his crew did it again! If you are on the fence about buying this album, let me tell you its a sure thing. If you buy and dont like it you should probably stick to something you are more familar with like Kenny G or Yanni.

006092988X|5.0|Betty Smith's A Tree Grows in Brooklyn transports us back to an earlier time, the early part of the 20th century in one of the most famous places on earth, Brooklyn, New York.  Here masses of relatively new working class Americans came to make their way, dreaming about the endless possibilities while working hard to make it through the day.<br /><br />In this faraway place we meet the Nolan family, Katie and Johnnie who marry young, love, work hard, and bear two children, Francie, young, impressionable and sensitive to the hard world but aware that beyond her neighborhood's confines is a gentler world she wishes to enter, and Neeley, tough and tender at the same time but rambunctious and anxious to live for the moment.<br /><br />Johnnie Nolan makes his way as a singing waiter.  He is liked by everyone for his friendly, respectful and thoughtful ways.  As a father he encourages Francie, his \\"prima donna\\" to follow her dreams, and he encourages her fancies just as he lives in his own--that the impresario will discover him one night as he works, and all his wishes will come true.<br /><br />In order to keep her home together, Katie Nolan does not have the luxury of dreams.  She works as a janitress in her building.  She loves Johnnie, but she does not like his drinking nor the idea that she cannot depend upon him.  Her sense of responsibility makes her appear hard, and in some ways she is, but she feels she has to act as she does if her children are to have a better and easier life than she has.<br /><br />Katie's mother, who can neither read nor write, insists that the family reads the Bible and William Shakespeare.  Each night they read whether they understand or not, for she knows that somehow it is education that opens doors to a better world.  It is Francie's intention, in fact, to read her way, alphabetically, through the books in the library, and she reads voraciously.<br /><br />We meet Katie's sister, Sissy, with her peculiarities.

030746363X|4.0|First, I have to say that I AM a big fan of Tim.  Second, I wish his methods worked for me. I'll still give him 4 stars.<br /><br />So, my boyfriend and I decided to follow the techniques in this book in order to achieve our new year's resolutions like the majority of the people out there.  My bf had bought the 4HWW and lives very happily by it.  He's a fan and suggested I'd be a fan too after reading his second book, 4HB.<br /><br />So I did. And I became a fan.  I read the sections of the book most appealing to me, and was excited and ready to start the diet.  I took measurement, bought groceries and supplements and started counting down the days until Saturday (my cheat day).  The first week we were both cranky and cold (haha!).  The second and third weeks, progress was visible (my face got thinner), but nothing else really changed.  On the other hand, my bf had lost close to ten pounds by the third week.  I had lost maybe 1 pound.<br /><br />It's been almost two months for me now on the Slow Carb diet.  My boyfriend quit because he was LOSING TOO MUCH WEIGHT.  I wanna kill him.  Everything Tim suggested is working VERY WELL for my boyfriend, but not at all for me.  His testosterone has increased- the whole thing about Brazil nuts and whatnot IS working.  The 15 minute orgasm?  It gives guys peace of mind, but women?  Ehh.  It's a mechanical approach.  Intimacy and romance are more important and effective for most women.  It's QUALITY, not quantity guys.  If a woman knows that her boyfriend just wants to beat his record time, it makes her feel like he doesn't care about her at all.  This actually PROLONGS the orgasm from happening or destroys it completely.<br /><br />Back to the Diet...<br />I am going stronger on the 4hb than ever because I am determined to make this work, but unfortunately, I have had no progress.  I GAINED TEN POUNDS.  I am curious and furious.  I'm curious because I want to succeed on this diet, and have taken all the necessary steps Tim recommends in doing so.  I even stopped taking my birth control thinking that it might be interfering with weight loss.  I have been thinking maybe I should get more blood work done even though  I already had blood tests taken and the doc said nothing is wrong with my thyroid.  What else can I do?<br /><br />Things I am Doing:<br />Eating high protein breakfast within an hour of waking<br />Eating 3-4 meals a day of the recommended food.<br />Drinking TONS of water.<br />Drink 1-2 glasses of wine before bed 3- days a week.<br />Doing recommended exercises 3-4 times a week<br />Taking the PAGG stack as reccomended<br />Taking Coenzyme Q10<br />Meditating/yoga<br />Properly bingeing once a week and ONLY once a week on Saturday<br />* Basically, I am doing everything Tim says to do.  I have index cards all over my kitchen with tips and meals and times, etc. PLEASE WORK....<br /><br />Things I am Not Doing (but Tim says are not totally needed)<br />Taking ice baths/doing the ice pack thing<br /><br />Now I will say, occasionally when I am on the go, and I didn't pack a lunch, I will have an Atkins Advantage bar or Think Thin bar- both with at least twenty grams of protein, 2 grams of sugar or less and less than 5 grams of carbs.  I only do this about twice a week though, and I don't think it's enough to stall my entire two months worth of dieting.  I am also really tired a lot- I take a 2 hour nap in the afternoon, and I get about 8-9 hours of sleep each night.<br />Maybe my cortisol levels are higher than average?  I meditate and keep myself active to melt unwanted stress away.  But?  I really don't know what else to do.  I'm thinking of going back on my RAW food diet- which provided the fastest, best results, in my opinion.<br /><br />Before I do that though.... Can anybody help?

B004MPESSY|3.0|Do not be fooled, this movie is very intense and will elicit strong emotions from its viewers. If you enjoy a good revenge flick this may be for you. If you cannot handle a very graphic rape scene I would stay away.     As for the movie in general, I'll give it credit. It really makes you pull for the girl who is harmed. You not only see her change mentally but physically as well. The antagonists are drawn up well and the acting is pretty good, especially from the protagonist. I never saw the original, so I can not compare the two. I will say from reading other comments that this one is a bit more believable--- probably (aside from the sheriff's randomness of trying to plug people with his own shotgun from his squad car, can you say forensics?). Not a bad movie though, the girl is pretty damn righteous.
B00127RAJY|4.0|This workout is a great starting place. It is nice because it has 3 levels that are packed with strengthing cario and ab workouts. I felt stronger and thinner after one week. I don't like that the video does not let you skip right to the main menu on startup so you have to listen to her spiel about her workouts every time you put it in.
0684833395|4.0|Like most who have read this novel at different times in their lives, the first readings are not nearly so fulfilling as the reading once the silly arrogance of college life has long been left behind.  This book means more to those of us who have matured because the institutional insanity so cleverly articulated by Heller in this novel is more pervasive today... and not just in the the military. I think it takes decades of living before some of the truths in novels such as this meaningfully reveal themselves.  When I was required to read this in an American Lit. class in college, I pretended to understand it, because I was full of myself.  Now, looking back, I realize I didn't understand it then at all.
0756404738|3.0|I just finished the book this morning. Without giving anything anyway that wasn't mentioned in the item description/amazon review, I'll say that the pages devoted to Kvothe's dealings with Felurian and the Adem consume too much of the book. Altogether, there is much of waiting and wishing for things to happen throughout the story; not enough happens to need over 1,000 pages. I feel this book needs distilled down to around half the size.  I have read the likes of George RR Martin, Robin Hobb, Tolkien, and Scott Lynch. The Name of the Wind is one of my all time favorites. My reading it four times through still left me wanting to read it again. After my first read of Wise Man's Fear, I am left wanting.  My fear is that Book 3 will not regain the magic of the first.
B000RC129Y|5.0|This book is a classic. By sharing a well-constructed but brief and very personal memoir, Stephen King illustrates what he does best: he tells us a story. The reader learns \\"how he got there.\\"  In the second section, the portion entitled \\"On Writing,\\" King again describes, in basic and simple terms, his \\"toolbox\\" as a writer and what all writers should have at their disposal. The nitty, gritty of the craft of writing. And as someone who has sworn allegiance to Mssrs. Strunk and White for over 50 years, I admire his homage to this classic of grammar and style.<br />Unlike how-to books, which are largely repetitive and non-specific, he describes clearly how these particular tools work--for him. The reader/potential writer can extrapolate and customize from there.<br />In the final section, painful and personal descriptions of his near fatal accident in 1999 are painted with the same talented brush storkes as the rest of the book. As a teacher and a writer I often use this book as a reference text for writers, both as required reading and opportunities for discussion. What he has to offer applies to all genres--memoir, fiction, fantasy, horror, nonfiction, essay. His book is not only readable but entertaining.

B0038M2AZA|5.0|This is a great movie.  Well acted. I was especially impressed with her tenacity in facing cowboys who obviously were not thrilled about having a woman tell them what they needed to do not alone one that seemed rather weird.  They were really mean and I'm sure it wasn't easy.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I have not been able to get emotionally attached to characters since the Harry Potter Series. For years I have been searching for a book to move me in the same way J.K Rowling's world of magic has moved me. I found that in this book. The Hunger Games made me fall in love with the characters :) I suffered with them, I laughed with them. I was finally able to embark on the journey and feel something extraordinarily special. This book is captivating.
1416550550|5.0|Beautifully written!  The alternating time periods of the chapters are fascinating and help to weave the connections between the characters as they search to solve a family mystery.  The characters are all very well developed and  are all absorbing in their own time periods.  Kate Morton slowly and skillfully unravels the mystery as you read, incorporating fairy tales to symbolize the events that occurred.  It reminded me of reading fairy tales as a child, except this one is for adults--I loved it!  Definitely want to read other books by this author.
B000O8OTNC|5.0|I wasn't sure what to expect with this one, but it is a great little tool. It is So light you almost cannot feel it in your hand, but yet, seems well constructed, and does not look like something that would fall apart. I used it to touch up a couple of near sharp knives, and to do a complete sharpen on a very dull old knife.  It did a good job.  Not as good as a professional knife sharpening, but as good or better than any other \\"10 second sharpener\\" I have seen in the past.  I was very impressed with it for the price, size, and weight.
0425200469|4.0|What constantly surprises me about reading Agatha Christie (apart from solving the mystery) is how the most important clues seem to absent-mindedly stick in my head even though there's misdirection everywhere else. Death on the Nile is involved. There are stories within stories, all overlapping one another, and I wasn't able to keep track of it all on the first read. The book itself seems to acknowledge this complexity by resolving the separate accounts one at a time at the story's finale. And when it came time to reveal the murderer... alas, all the clues were right there the whole time and it made perfect sense!<br /><br />The location of Egypt and the Nile is intended to represent an exotic, away-from-civilization locale, which mostly succeeds. Egypt during this period might very well be a vast track of empty desert with local merchants scattered throughout because that's how it's portrayed in the book and not much more.<br /><br />And as always, Poirot is the grand-master of human observation, with just the right touch of conceit, which makes him a pleasure to read.
B000YABIQ6|5.0|This is a sleek and well made series I highly recommend for those who like amazing stories of the 60's. The wardrobe and makeup are perfection. Its sexy and interesting. The characters are very exciting to watch.
B003DZX3SA|5.0|For just about $12.00 my 2 year old daughter recieved her now favorite movie. She puts on her yellow dress and little yellow slippers and dances to all the music. It's so nice to watch something that doesn't drive me crazy. I'm a HUGE disney fan and grew up on all of the movies so this was just another one to add to my little ones collection. Great buy:)
B002ZG98FU|5.0|I think this movie is a HILARIOUS chick flick. So fun! Just dont take it too seriously. If you want an Oscar winner, look elsewhere, but this movie is a blast!!!!
B001ECDVYK|5.0|Tarantino at his best. One of the greatest trash movies around, very funny and open minded. The DVD has English and Franch subtitles and audio tracks only.
B001RCD2DW|5.0|I purchased these headphones looking for a crystal clear, flat sound for post-production audio mixing. I do just about everything from acoustic signer-songwriter, to metal, to video-post and I love these headphones so far. It takes a bit to get used to not having the \\"proximity effect\\" with closed back headphones. It's more like having high-quality speakers in an acoustically accurate room. A note about the \\"attributes stars\\"... these are OPEN back headphones, so you will hear other noises in the room, and others can hear when you're listening to music. There are many benefits to open-backed headphones for engineers, but if you're looking for something that isolates, avoid open back!
B000002KCV|4.0|To me (having listened to all of Neils albums in my teenage years) this is like the last of a special batch that started with his great 'Everybody knows this is nowhere' album. Better said, the last of his golden period. Of course i love other stuff that came after, like Rust Never Sleeps. But up to this point there is a greatness in his writing, his voice is at it's best and his band (Crazy Horse) is still going strong ... the best he ever had (the perfect band for his style). Yet this is somewhat different than what came before. The songs seem a bit more acoustic driven, mellower and melodically richer. Not  many in the hard rock mode in this one. It reminds me of Harvest but with different 'production' (on most songs Neil is doubled with female voice). Anyways, it's definitely one to get if you crave for Neils 70s stuff.
B004M54NWU|1.0|Do yourself a favor and don't waist your time and money watching this movie. Look into rotten tomatoes and other review sites and you will see that this movie is a waist. I didn't believe it, and I truly waisted $3.99 plus 110 minutes of my life.
0393338827|5.0|This book is a must have if you want to understand the inside workings that helped bring down the American economy in 2008.     My buddy borrowed this book and would not give it back until he finished it (only a couple of days later).     The swearing in it is excessive, but I guess that is how those guys really talk.
B003Q6D2BE|5.0|This movie was not exactly what I was expecting. Sure I figured action adventure which it certainly is but it has a lot of humor in it. Though not Oscar material it is a great way to spend a couple of hours. Where it is and it isn't exactly what you thought it would be it certainly doesn't hurt the movie at all. The big surprise is that the cell is all older actors and an actress not what one usually sees in youth driven Hollywood. That being said I found it to be a nice change of pace. (Just so you know, I am 46).The acting was very good with out being over done. The action was crisp...though I am sure some of you would think that it was violent, very violent. However, it is what you would expect in a movie like this. The humor works well and is in the places where you would expect it. Again it is not over done and you never get the feeling that they are playing for laughs. It is exactly how real life would unfold. You find yourself laughing because what is happening is actually funny and in a way you can relate to it. This movie does have a story and the story does make perfect sense, you just have to let it unfold and you are rewarded. Also this movie has an excellent cast,so much better than most movies and they all do a terrific job, so much so you are sorry when the movie ends. For me Karl Urban was the draw and I was not disappointed with his performance. He actually made feel that he enjoyed every thing about giving this performance in this movie, which of course made me enjoy this movie even more. All and all this movie gets a solid 10 out of 10 from me. It has action, adventure, humor, violence, and a love story well make that two love stories, how can you go wrong.
B004EBT5CU|5.0|God but I do not know where to begin when describing Adele's new album \\"21\\"...<br /><br />I do remember seeing her for the first time in Q magazine.....I believe Madonna was on the cover promoting her brilliant \\"Hard Candy\\" album and I opened to the second page and saw those haunting eyes and expression on this beautiful face and thought that this was someone very special....and then I purchased \\"19\\" and was struck by a totally original and beautifully expressive voice, the likes I have not heard in many a year.<br /><br />Adele's newest album builds on her first success by leaps and bounds and constitutes quite an achievement for one so young.  I hear many influences, the most direct to my ears being the great Dusty but listen and you will hear traces of Aretha, Janis, Billie, and even, in terms of truth and soul Garland and Piaf....all the while being a totally individual and brilliant talent all her own.  Nobody sounds like Adele today and when you hear her you instantly know who this voice belongs to.  This ain't no media pushing commercial pulp!!!<br /><br />Listen in particular to Take It All, Set Fire To the Rain, Turning Tables, Lovesong, Rumour Has It, and the sublime Someone Like you and you will hear a voice and artistry that will be in it for the long long long run....please Adele, don't prove me wrong!!!!!<br /><br />Luigi ~ NYC
0805017593|5.0|Another classic book from Bill Martin Jr. and Eric Carle!  Polar Bear, Polar Bear features a new batch of interesting animals and their sounds, too.  Both my boys love this book just as much as Brown Bear, Brown Bear and Panda Bear, Panda Bear.  My 2 year old particularly loves the vibrant pictures and repetition in the text.  It took him no time at all to catch on and now he can recite the whole book!  He also learned all his colours with the help of these books.  A must for anyone with a toddler or preschooler!
B0045U9WPU|5.0|I accidentally purchased this book but the minute I read the first sentence I was hooked. I read this book in about 7 hours. It was wow I mean a world free of love full of fear of the deliria? It is just incomprehensible but at the same time strangly believable. I couldn't believe that people would cut out their feelings yet I could understand their fear of the uncontrollable. Again just ... wow. At times I just wanted to grab the characters and shake them while yelling &#34;Are you NUTS??!!&#34; I couldn't believe the ending!! I wanted yell &#34;Idiot!&#34; all the while wondering what is going to happen next???????????!!!!!

0316067601|5.0|Up close and personal account of a Navy Seal and his experiences from his lifelong dream of becoming a Seal, to the defining battle of \\"Operation Redwing\\".  This is a first hand account of what really happened.  Even though I may not agree with the authors politics, he is an American Hero in every sense of the word. I found this book hard to put down from the first page to the last. Really puts into perspective of what these guys do out there \\"for us\\" -often paying the ultimate sacrifice, to protect us (the American people). This book should be a must- read for everyone!
B00475AYJQ|5.0|I've been a fan of Mr. Rothfuss for several years now, since I first read \\"The Name of the Wind\\". To be honest, I had my misgivings about the sequel when I began reading it on my kindle about ten minutes after it went on sale. As I worked through the story, I felt a strange dissonance, as if something were wrong with what I was reading.     By the time I finished the book, I was satisfied with what I had read, but I still felt like something was slightly off. I didn't want to think that it was the book itself, so I started jumping back to parts I had highlighted.     It wasn't that there was anything wrong with \\"Wise Man's Fear\\", but  rather in how I perceived it. What I had before me was a piece of writing that had fooled me on first glance. My own preconceived notions on what a story about Kvothe should be were the problem. The first book affected me so deeply, built such a powerful image in my mind, that the different tone and content of the second just didn't match up.     Much like the characters in his works, the story of Kvothe itself changed and grew. I had to make myself see it--this story is about Kvothe growing up, making mistakes, and experiencing the world in a wider way. \\"The Wise Man's Fear\\" is just as good as the first book, if not better--but for different reasons altogether, at least for me.     I laughed hard many times, I had tears come to my eyes. I read the words herein and looked at myself in a different light as a consequence. Mr. Rothfuss has proven once again that the best fiction, whatever the genre, has something deep and true to say about the human condition. He goes beyond stating those truths, though, because his care with words and story makes you search and discover within yourself.     In short, you look at the inner turnings of your name, the entirety of who you are, and ask--What would I have done in Kvothe's place? Would I have made his mistakes, would I have had his creativity?     Overall, a moving piece of work by a man who isa master of his craft. Five stars.
1439133948|3.0|Yay - Miles is back - the hyperactive dwarf, imperial auditor from Barrayar.<br /><br />For those who have read, and reread, the Vorkorsigan saga this is a welcome return. Bujold has spent the last few years on other (very worthwhile) projects and it is great to see her return to Miles.<br /><br />But I didn't a sense in this book that he was really back. The plot is lacks the twists and turns of the previous series. While he is still impulsive and a general menace to ordered society, he doesn't quite get into as much trouble. Some aspects of the story seem underdeveloped and even under explained.<br /><br />The book comes to an unexpected ending, which suggests that it is really a prologue for a whole new series. I really hope that is the case. It would be a shame to loose such a wonderful character.
B0014U4X3U|4.0|Awesome price for Jane Austin.  Much less than you would pay for hardcover editions.  No page numbers, and a couple of typographical errors-which was too bad, but otherwise, I am very happy with this purchase.
0670022411|4.0|Plot Summary:  Eminent historian Diana Bishop is in Oxford doing research for an upcoming keynote address.  She's also a witch, but having long denied that fact, she's unprepared for the consequences of summoning a bewitched book from the Bodleian's collection.  Diana can feel the magic thrumming through this ancient little manuscript, and so can a lot of other creatures apparently, because the library is soon beset by more witches, daemons, and a disconcertingly attractive vampire named Matthew Clairmont.  They all want this book, and since Diana is the first person to successfully summon it in more than a century, they want her as well.    (All Souls Trilogy: Book One)    A Discovery of Witches is a meaty paranormal romance that promises to be as intricate and involved as an urban fantasy series.  Don't be fooled by its conservative cover.  This is for readers who love romance, adventure, and vampires, and not necessarily in that order.  I kind of shudder to think what a non-romance fan will say when they innocently stumble into Deborah Harkness's vision of a Romeo-Juliet love affair between an ancient vampire and an unschooled witch, but that's not my problem since I AM a big romance fan, and speaking as such I can vouch for its quality as a paranormal romance.    A Discovery of Witches deviates from its brethren with the racy covers by devoting more attention to world building, and less time in the bedroom.  This makes the story more approachable for a wider audience, but I still maintain that this is for romance fans through and through.  The core of the story revolves around Diana and Matthew's burgeoning relationship, with passages like these (pg. 135):    \\"You mustn't romanticize vampires.  Knox may not have your best interests at heart, but he was right about me.\\"    \\"Other people don't pick my friends-certainly not bigots like Knox.\\"  My fingers began to prickle as my anger mounted, and I shoved them under my thighs.    \\"Is that what we are, then?  Friends?\\" Matthew asked.    \\"I think so.  Friends tell each other the truth, even when it's difficult.\\"  Disconcerted by the seriousness of the conversation, I toyed with the ties on my sweater.    \\"Vampires aren't particularly good at friendship.\\"  He sounded angry again.    \\"Look, if you want me to leave you alone-\\"    \\"Of course not,\\" Matthew interrupted.  \\"It's just that vampire relationships are . . . complicated.  We can be protective-possessive, even.  You might not like it.\\"    \\"A little protectiveness sounds pretty good to me about now.\\"    My answer brought a look of raw vulnerability to Matthew's eyes.  \\"I'll remind you of that when you start complaining,\\" he said, the rawness quickly replaced with wry amusement.    Nothing in the story is terribly original, but the solid execution makes up for that deficiency in my mind.  I was wonderfully entertained each time I went back to it (at 579 pages, it's no lightweight), and furthermore the story took an interesting fork at the end that tantalized me without frustrating me.  The jacket flap says that this is the first book in the All Souls trilogy, and I am looking forward to the second installment with keen interest.

0385341679|4.0|Plot Summary:  The cliffhanger at the end of Dreamfever was a doozy, and we pick up with Mac right where we left her last -- alone and shattered in the Silvers.  Having lost nearly everyone who matters to her, Mac cozies up to the Lord Master, her greatest enemy, to seduce his secrets out of him.  When that plan fails, an unlikely band of adversaries unite together to trap the book, but each group has their own end goal, and it remains to be seen whether anyone has the power to control the Sinsar Dubh. Along the way Mac starts to doubt her own identity.  Is she just a sidhe-seer, or something more sinister?    (Fever Series: Book Five)    Well, that was certainly an explosive conclusion to Karen Marie Moning's Fever series.  While I found Shadowfever to be a nearly irresistible page-turner, it also had a few dull patches here and there that had my eyes glazing over.  It had this surprising duality that kept enthralling me and frustrating me at the same time, but my love for this book far exceeds my nitpicks.  I can't help observing that this is the second robust book I've read this week that could have been 100 pages shorter and pleased me even more, but that seems to be the trend with successful series these days - their popularity and page counts bloom in tandem.    Ms. Moning has been building up an inordinate number of secrets and mysteries throughout the Fever series, and thank goodness that Shadowfever answers them all.  There would have been some serious mutinies amongst her fans otherwise.  I won't divulge any secrets in my review (check the spoiler section below for more), but she managed to insert some obvious and not so obvious twists that rewarded her faithful readers.  The ending was just as satisfying as the journey itself, and in that respect, Shadowfever is a triumph.    More than any other installment in this series, Shadowfever was overflowing with moody introspection, and therein lies my main issue with this book.  It's actually quite dull to watch a character mentally chase her own tail over and over again, and Mac spends far too much time inside her own brain box.  Things really heat up when she interacts with others though, and her relations with Barrons practically pop and sizzle.  Ms. Moning excels at raw eroticism that feels deliciously dirty without crossing the line to crude and uncomfortable, and the bedroom scenes will make up for every unfulfilled innuendo we've endured during the first three novels.    I highly recommend this series for urban fantasy aficionados, and for those of you who can't get enough of Mac and Barrons, the last page said that Ms. Moning is working on a graphic novel adaptation.  Given my past experience with GN adaptations, I'll pass, but I will be very interested in whatever series Ms. Moning decides to spin next.
0743496736|5.0|Jodi Picoult is known to tackle controversial issues in her novels, as evidenced by her novel \\"My Sister's Keeper\\", and she does it in a superb manner. \\"Nineteen Minutes\\" is a rare specimen of a book that allows you to take one controversial subject, a high school shooting in the small town of Sterling, and provides you an insight on how it affects all of the people surrounding it - be it the victims, the shooter, the parents of either, and even the law-enforcement involved. Picoult manages to take a subject filled with horror and violence, and infuse it with character, strength and courage in the most sensitive and humane manner possible.<br /><br />Peter Houghton, a 17-year old who'd been bullied since his first day of kindergarten, wakes up one day and decides that he could no longer bear being a victim. He carries four guns, two pistols and two shotguns, into his high school and within the span of Nineteen Minutes, he lines the school halls with ten dead bodies and several injured victims. His story is intertwined with that of Josie Cormier, a former friend of Peter, now a popular girl who is part of the \\"in-crowd\\" and in a relationship with Matthew Royston,her controlling boyfriend - a girl who finds herself feeling alienated even by those who she is closest to, her popularity coming at the price of never knowing who her true friends are. Also, tied to their stories are that of Peter's parents, who find themselves tearing down and examining every act of theirs as parents to see if it was their fault that their son is now, what most would call, a monster. And the story of Josie's mother, Alex, who feels like she has failed as a parent for a totally different reason.<br /><br />\\"Nineteen Minutes\\" will surprise you, make you cry, and sympathize with each of its characters. It will not provide you with answers, and is never \\"black or white\\" - but this story will also not prevaricate, and will force you to make your own judgments on who you think stands to be punished - the bully or the bullied? The murderer or the victim? The child or the parent? Personally, I feel that Nineteen Minutes should be mandatory reading for teenagers, so that they can understand what impact their actions could possibly have - be it pulling someone's pants down in a crowded cafeteria, or shooting out in a public high school. This book rattled me a little (at times, a lot), thinking of what my children would have to go through once they would reach high school, but it also made me want to try that much harder to make this world a safer haven for my future children - to understand them, regardless of how different they might be. I highly recommend this book to ANY and EVERY one! :)r the bullied? The murderer or the victim? The child or the parent?

B0031SU2Y2|4.0|\\"Welcome\\" begins with a 17-year-old Kurdish refugee Bilal's attempt to get smuggled into England. He is on the last lap of his long road to reunite his girlfriend Mina now living in London with her family. When Bilal's attempt fails, however, he finds himself stuck in Calais, the closest French town to England across the Channel.    The opening part of a French drama \\"Welcome\\" might remind you of a 2002 film \\"In This World\\" directed by Michael Winterbottom, but as the story unfolds, you will realize that \\"Welcome\\" is more about the unlikely friendship between two people than the journey the young protagonist takes. Bilal (Firat Ayverdi), though being a poor swimmer, takes lessons from the local instructor Simon (Vincent Lindon, \\"Pour Elle\\"). It doesn't take much time for Simon to see why Bilal is so eager to learn swimming. Bilal is going to swim across the Channel to meet his love.    The film's story is told with a very low key and somber approach. Though dealing with a political subject matter like illegal immigration, the quiet film refrains from shoving a message down your throat. \\"Welcome\\" is carefully crafted with an eye for detail that makes the two major characters Simon and Bilal vivid and complex.     \\"Welcome\\" benefits from compelling performances from the cast, most notably from the stars: newcomer Firat Ayverdi as Bilal, and Vincent Lindon as Simon, whose original motive for helping the Kurdish boy might not be totally altruistic. Simon still loves his estranged wife Marion (Audrey Dana), a schoolteacher who also works as a volunteer helping refugees. Is it that Simon only wanted to impress her?    \\"Welcome\\" is an engaging drama that maintains its dramatic tension throughout, greatly helped by the strong acting from the cast and the believable characters you really care.
B00364K6YW|5.0|I absolutely adore this version of Pride and Prejudice. Colin Firth is amazing as Mr. Darcy and the story line maintains a nice tempo. It never drags on or skips over the important parts. If you are going to buy this classic, this is definitely the version to buy. Also, plan on watching it all at once. It is impossible not too! The restored version of this series is really worth the money. I already had the original version on DVD, but decided to get this one too. I was not disappointed. The restored version really makes a difference in the quality of picture and the colors are a lot more vibrant and rich. Also, the sound is a lot better - the dialogue is a lot crisper.
B00005JNBQ|1.0|Why only one?  It isn't a good movie, I have never been compelled to sit for the whole thing, having seen it piecemeal but never all together.  Honestly it should be a .5 star film, but it doesn't hit that level of suck, it has some funny parts (the shooting of a cow in front of a school bus full of young children is hilarious) and it has a weird premise (that the main character is a totally unlikable loser with no redeeming features), but it has no plot, like \\"Fast Times at Ridgemont High\\" with all the likability and identifiable characters drained away and replaced with weirdness.  And when you remove Phoebe Cates nipples from a movie and replace them with Jon Heder, we all lose.
B0031RAOVY|5.0|Professor Wilson finds an abandoned dog at the train station one night. No one claims the dog and Wilson keeps him. In doing research, he finds the dog's breed to be an Akita and names him Hatichko. Hachi, as if knowing this man saved his life, bonds with Wilson and accompanies him to and from the train station every day. One day the professor doesn't return because he has passed away, but Hachi still waits for him at the station. For the next nine years, the dog's loyalty never waivers in memory of his friend. He arrives in the morning and waits until late but the professor is not coming back. Based upon a true Japanese story of a loyal dog whose statue sits in the Shibuya train station, this is a beautiful tale of loyalty and kindness.
B000AYELVU|5.0|Prior to \\"The Dark Knight\\" there were only 3 movies that could contend for best Superhero film ever, \\"Iron Man\\", \\"Spiderman 2\\" and this film \\"X2: X-Men United\\", of those three I take the position that this is the best one.    I have seen it numerous times and own the DVD.  While it lacks the action many normally demand from a film involving super humans, it replaces it with a great deal of subtext, making Magneto, Wolverine, Ice Man, and Rogue into potent three dimensional characters which really display iconic arch-types for people belonging to a minority group under siege.  The Radical who is willing to wipe out the majority; the Knight Errant who just wants to be left out but is drawn in by his desire to find a place and do what is right; the New Indoctrinate who has to deal with the bigotry and confusion of not only society, but his own family; and the Untouchable, who is the supreme outcast, considered a lower distasteful class that by contact drains the purity of the majority.    This movie is deep.
B002ZG98Z0|4.0|Although not quite as good as the first movie, I loved revisiting the girls. You see a different side of Big. Suspend disbelief and you'll enjoy the Dubai sequence.<br /><br />Have Carrie and Big settled into domestic bliss? Is Samantha as outrageous as ever? Fans of the series will still love it. Look for cameos featuring Liza Minnelli and Penelope Cruz.
B002VPE1PW|5.0|I love this sleeve! It fits nicely for my Acer Apsire One AOD255. I also find it nice that you can open it all the way and use it as a cover to block the public view of what kind of laptop/netbook/electronic you have.

B0029QRA1U|5.0|I'm really pleased with this turntable. It plays my records beautifully and only took seconds to hook into my home theater system. My only complaint is the short RCA connector which wasn't an issue for me because my turntable sits on top of my surround sound box, but I could definitely see it being a pain if that weren't the case.    All in all I am 100% satisfied with my purchase and am glad I chose this product!
079073463X|5.0|Visually a work of art, this film is based on a 13th century European legend about a beautiful maiden (Michelle Pfeiffer), a stalwart knight (Rutger Hauer) and a pickpocket (Matthew Broderick). The knight and the lady were once lovers, but a curse by the jealous Bishop of Aquila has left them \\"always together, eternally apart.\\" By day, she is a hawk; by night he is a wolf.<br /><br />This one has a great storyline and interesting characters. Philipe's (Broderick) conversations with God add a wonderful dimension to the film as does Leo McKern as the old monk.
B003XQRZ7E|5.0|can't listen to this enough, has to be one of the best cd's of 2010 - joe & co at their best BRILL :)
B002ZG977Y|2.0|I loved the classical clash of the Titans ,so when i heard of a remake i said !wow! this should be good. Unfortunetly this did not live up to my expectations . The story line changed some what from the original in my opionion, and develop way to fast. tHE Graphics are okay but all in all a huge disppointment to me.
B003UESJFG|5.0|This is an all-around great movie.  There is something for children and grownups alike.  The voices are outstanding, especially of Will Ferrell, Tina Fey, and Ben Stiller.  The story is well told.  I find the main idea to be, that villains (criminals) and heroes (cops) are really on two sides of the same business and cannot exist without each other.  The visuals are superb, with incredible details, especially of crowds, crumbles of buildings, and dust.  The sound is as good and detailed as it gets, and it surely takes advantage of all speakers.  Highly recommended for 90 minutes of fun.  I have been smiling for days as I recall some funny lines, and think about the deeper meaning of the film.
B000001ELB|5.0|Some of the best Kiss songs from over a decade, as the name suggests, pure Platinum.  The guitar riffs take me back to my youth, I love it!
B0035G5IOE|3.0|To me the voices made this movie.  George Clooney and Meryl Streep did a fantastic job.  I did not like the story much, because it seemed repetitious and boring.  The stop-motion animation was done before and better by Nick Park.  Watch it once if you have nothing better.
B002ZG99N6|4.0|I liked Town.  It had good action sequences, and a decent story line.  Sometimes the story line got a little slow, but thats okay because it's still an action movie at its core.  I bought it because a friend of mine said if I liked the movie \\"Heat\\", I'd like this one.  This movie didn't come close to the action in Heat.  However, it's still decent, and worth at least one watching.
B00407PNY2|5.0|Watching this again many years after it was originally released was still fun. Exciting story and the car chase scenes in San Francisco are great. Too bad McQueen died so young. . .
B00006879E|5.0|I bought this CD after hearing several musicians playing covers of 'secret' on YouTube.  I wanted to learn the original version, and then got hooked into the other songs on the CD.  Great CD overall.
B001IBIHQ4|2.0|I couldn't even finish watching it. The acting and directing is dismal, the characters dull and uninteresting. I did not feel like I was there, in the South Pacific in 1942. You could make an animated movie with those stick figures speaking in monotone computer voices and it wouldn't be any worse. Not even in the same league, not even in the same universe as Band of Brothers. Big disappointment!
0061726826|2.0|WARNING: SPOILERS ABOUND IN THE BELOW REVIEW.     Delirium, Delirium, Delirium, let me see, what can I say about you that doesn't involve laments of failed expectations, fits of insurmountable rage, and copious amounts of hair-tearing? Really, you started out wonderfully, with prose that, if not ground breaking, was at least nice and beautiful at times. You had a great character in Hana, who, by FAR, was my favorite in the entire book. You had a decent lead in Lena, who, if not very interesting, seemed to at least hold her own in life.     Well.........on second thought, not really. In the beginning, she panics at the slightest thought of disobedience, which really annoyed me, although I get that you were trying to convey the depth of her unquestioning faith in her society, and contrast that with her eventual change of heart and disillusionment with her faux-utopia. Still. Don't you think the story might have been bucketloads more interesting had Hana been the main character? Imagine the daring escapades! The crackling wit and vibrancy! The ability to be her own person, and not be some dimwitted puppet to be pulled along by the strings of society and Alex and family? Lena made me mad. She was so...pathetic, I guess, is the word I'm looking for. Sure, maybe she had moments of bravery where she took the initiative, but good Lord, those rare moments were always heralded by endless paragraphs about how brave she was to have stepped up to the plate. But anyways, I'm not the author so it's not my call.     I started Delirium, and in the beginning, everything was good. Great, in fact. The writing was great, the story promising, the characters interesting. It keeps going, going, going this way, until we get to that inevitable point where our young heroine meets her One True Love for the first time.     And hey!-still going strong.     Lena meets Alex for the first time in a cow stampede in the middle of her evaluation, and I gotta say, it's unique. And what's even better, she goes home, and she does NOT obsess over ZOMGBBQ-mysterious-hawt-guy!!!11 At this point, in my head, I'm already cackling and fist-pumping and telling myself that yes!- this might well be a kickass story, jaw dropping, ground-breaking, worthy of five stars. But shortly thereafter...she goes for a run with her BFF Hana and meets One True Love again, and bam, like that, the story goes downhill.     For one, it's that insta-love crap again, where is absolutely NO basis for their love, and if there is, it's as flimsy as gauze (I was going to make a crack here about our economy, but naaaah). They meet maybe twice and suddenly they are each other's One Tru Undying Forevar and Evar Eternal Luv(tm), and I'm sitting here raging and screaming WHAT? Because the reason that Alex is smitten with her is because many years ago, he played Stalker McStalkypants and saw her running near a shop where he was working. And according to Alex, who is evidently blind, Lena was just sooooooooo \\"awake\\"! And if Lena is awake, then I ask you, what of HANA? They were running together, and Lena, repeatedly, throughout the book, has always said that Hana was so much more vibrant and confident than her, and yet Alex ignores 100000-wattage Hana and goes for Lena? Timid, obedient, boring Lena, who is as \\"awake\\" as I am at 3AM in the morning? Bah, humbug.     And then after they discover that they love each other dearly, the story just consists of a lot of waxing poetic about how lovely love is and whatnot, interspersed with paltry bits of action and actual points of interest. When I end up cheering because the heroine gets caught by the baddies, because her plans have been quashed because their love's been found out, well, that's bad. I think I was supposed to have gasped in fear and dismay and said oh noes, right? Because I was supposed to have been invested in their love story. I might be alone in this sentiment, but I was completely sick and tired of the endless smooching by this point, and wasgleeful when the regulators locked down their hideout and foiled their plans. Oh, and I was disgruntled when Lena ended up escaping.     There was another problem. This world...was meh. There was no true worldbuilding going on here, as practically required when one writes a dystopia. I could imagine Portland, but that was all. What, exactly, is this world of yours? The other cities? The other people? The other countries? The government? Surely the United States cannot be the only country left standing in your world. And even if it is, who, really, is the oppressor here? One of the greatest problems I had with this book was the lack of villains present. There were only the mooks. The red shirts. The expendable soldiers, the brainless minions. There was never a Big Bad here, and I found fault with this because I like it better when there is a figurehead for evil/bad/wrong around. Where is the Mayor Prentiss of this world? The President Snow? The Voldemort?     I will say this, though. Delirium is very readable. The pages practically flip themselves, despite my nitpickings and issues with the story. Oliver's writing is very accessible, pretty but not overwrought like the classics of old.     Anyways, look, I get that the entire premise of this book is that in this society love has been deemed a horrid disease, and that Lauren Oliver's point was to show us that NO, that's wrong, love is great and powerful and showstopping, but I feel like she could have done it without relying on such worn tropes as instant love and Twilight-esque romance and despicable dependency (I cannot live without you! I shall die if we ever part! etc, etc). Lauren Oliver has a lot of promise, that much is evident, but in my eyes it was wasted here. What could have been an amazing story about love and defiance and free will and humanity was degenerated into a mushy mushy goo goo sop of a love story.     That said, I aim to continue this series for four reasons.   1) Pretty book titles. Delirium, Pandemonium, Requiem. Music to my ears!   2) Pretty book covers.   3) Pretty writing.   4) The stray, fragile chance that Alex might die or that Lena might grow some cojones or that we get to see more of this world (Europe! Asia! Africa!) or that the love story might fall apart and Hana might become the main character.
B0040JHWKS|3.0|This was very refreshing to go back and hear music like this; esepcially in today's barrenness in music. Some tunes on this cd make it worth a purchase; but not the purchase price. Way too steep for tracks that did not make the cut.  Also,outside of a few tunes I feel this is very ordinary for Bruce's standards.   Even the tunes I liked lacked a bit. 'Save My Love' was wonderful...but 2 minutes long???? It needed a refrain, or another few verses and tack on another minute or two. The end of the song could have been a transition...but it just dies right then and there?  Overall, mind you, I am somewhat pleased with it and glad I found it. However, if I had to do it over again, I'd simply download single songs.  I know this review may tick off some of the Boss devotees...and I am one...but it is what it is. There is a reason these songs did not make the cut; although how \\"Racing in the Street\\" did not at least make 'The River\\" or something is beyond me?
B00028HBKC|5.0|Gibson does an exceptional job in this film depicting Christ's life, especially his final hours, but I still don't think we will ever be able to fathom what Christ went through so that we might be saved. He did it not for Himself, but for you and me! He humbled Himself, and He came to the earth not to be served, but to serve and to save to world. No better example of what love is than Jesus Christ. Relgions offer lots of things, but Christ offers a relationship with God through His sacrifice. Nobody else in the history of the world has claimed to be God and proven it. He said He would be betrayed and killed and He was. But most significantly, He said he would rise again after three days, and He did! Jesus did many other things while He was on earth but if that in itself isn't enough to prove He is God's son, I don't know else can. John 10:10
B003ME15CS|5.0|Let me start by saying I liked Rated R.  Many people weren't fans because it wasn't the \\"happy, bubbly\\" version of Rihanna's music they were used to, and cast the album off without giving it a fair listen.  This CD takes those songs many thought were too slow, and makes them into quality remixes.  After hearing Loud, I wish she'd would've taken some tracks off of this album and released them instead, because most of them really are ~that~ good!    Stand out tracks:  Russian Roulette   Wait Your Turn  Photographs (wish they'd taken Will.i.am's part out of it though)  G4L  **Firebomb - hands down the best track on this CD - AMAZING remix to this song  Stupid In Love    In all, if you're a Rihanna fan, but felt the songs on Rated R were too slow for your tastes, get this album - you'll love it!
B0041KKYEM|4.0|Addiction has always been a common theme in Darren Aronofsky's films.  Black Swan is no different.  Obsessed with perfection, Nina (Natalie Portman), a ballet dancer, struggles immensely when she is given the diverse role of the Swan Queen for the ever famous ballet, Swan Lake.  While she seems ideal for the part, her only fault is in portraying the role of the evil Black Swan.  Her strive for perfection creates a whirlwind of frustration, tension, and paranoia that will either make her or break her in this dazzling film.  Unlike most of Aronofsky's films, it is not just a story about obsession and tragedy.  He turns the Black Swan into a dark, Gothic horror film that is unlike any other movie this year.  Don't be misguided by it's feminine appeal; Black Swan is a provocative movie that you won't be able to get out of your head for days.  This film gets two enthusiastic wings up!

0156030306|5.0|One of the most recent classics is also one of the best, and it will not bore you to tears.  I've read it twice and remembered, again, why it was such an amazing book.  I'm shouting from wireless rooftops here for everyone to read it!    And as for those posting reviews who just can't get past the smallest obstacle that takes them oustide their own sheltered lives (especially those who felt so compelled to mention that this made the \\"banned book\\" list), I don't know what to say....Did you even read it?
1416583432|4.0|\\"Inside of a Dog\\" is a kind of measured, careful appreciation of dogs.  Unlike books by dog trainers, which focus on changing dog behavior to meet our expectations, this book concentrates on what is known about dog's physiology, behavior and senses to postulate a way to appreciate dogs \\"as dogs\\".    Make no mistake, Horowitz is a dog lover... but she is also a scientist.  She extols her own dog with excerpts from a notebook of sensitive and tender observations of her pet.  But she assiduously avoids the kind of florid, anthropomorphic writing that you'll find in the writing of those are infatuated with dogs as an extension of themselves.  Therefore the reader is spared the goopy prose of a J.R. Ackerley (\\"My Dog Tulip\\"), or the pseudo-philosophizing of a Vicki Hearne.    You won't find \\"Lassie\\" or \\"Rin Tin-Tin\\" here, but you may be reminded of your own lovable, floppy-eared pooch.  For those who like to be entertained by dog antics, this book probably won't be lively reading.  But if you are really interested in looking into what makes your dog tick, and deepening your sense of a dog's intrinsic value, this book will do just fine.
1593272200|5.0|I had no idea there could exist a book like this. I love it.   I think the author struck the exact right balance between what to cover in detail and what the reader should be expected to know (or learn elsewhere).  You mostly get down-to-earth prose explaining how things work, why they work this way and what you must pay attention to.   The programming examples are examples to follow.   I expect this beautiful work to positively impact the future of the linux community.
B00012QM8G|5.0|Spielberg's film is one of the most moving I've ever seen.  The realism can be disturbing at times but the performances are first rate.  If you want to see compassion in action, watch this story of Oskar Schindler's WWII effort to save as many Polish Jews as he could.  Amazing!  It's no wonder this film won so many awards.    From the \\"amc filmsite\\" review by Tim Dirks […]:    \\"Schindler's List (1993) is Steven Spielberg's unexpected award-winning masterpiece - a profoundly shocking, unsparing, fact-based, three-hour long epic of the nightmarish Holocaust. [Italian-American catholic Martin Scorsese was originally slated to direct the film, but turned down the chance - claiming the film needed a director of Jewish descent - before turning it over to Spielberg.] Its documentary authenticity vividly re-creates a dark, frightening period during World War II, when Jews in Nazi-occupied Krakow were first dispossessed of their businesses and homes, then placed in ghettos and forced labor camps in Plaszow, and finally resettled in concentration camps for execution. The violence and brutality of their treatment in a series of matter-of-fact (and horrific) incidents is indelibly and brilliantly orchestrated.     \\"Except for the bookends (its opening and closing scenes) and two other brief shots (the little girl in a red coat and candles burning with orange flames), the entire film in-between is shot in crisp black and white. The film is marvelous for the way in which it crafts its story without contrived, manipulative Hollywood-ish flourishes (often typical of other Spielberg films) - it is also skillfully rendered with overlapping dialogue, parallel editing, sharp and bold characterizations, contrasting compositions of the two main characters (Schindler and Goeth), cinematographic beauty detailing shadows and light with film-noirish tones, jerky hand-held cameras (cinema verite), a beautifully selected and composed musical score (including Itzhak Perlman's violin), and gripping performances.     \\"The screenplay by Steven Zaillian was adapted from Thomas Keneally's 1982 biographic novel (Schindler's Ark), constructed by interviews with 50 Schindler survivors found in many nations, and other wartime associates of the title character, as well as other written testimonies and sources. Oskar Schindler was an enterprising, womanizing Nazi Sudeten-German industrialist/opportunist and war profiteer, who first exploited the cheap labor of Jewish/Polish workers in a successful enamelware factory (Deutsche Emailwaren Fabrik or D.E.F.), and eventually rescued more than one thousand of them from certain extinction in labor/death camps.     \\"Before the film was made, Spielberg had offered Holocaust survivor and director Roman Polanski the job of making the film, but Polanski declined. Since then, ten years later, Polanski made his own honored Holocaust film, the Best Director-winning The Pianist (2002). Stanley Kubrick abandoned his own plans to make a similar film in the planning stages, called \\"The Aryan Papers\\" - based on the Louis Begley novel Wartime Lies.     \\"The unanimously-praised film with a modest budget of $23 million deservedly won seven Academy Awards, including Best Picture, Best Director (the first for Spielberg), Best Cinematography (Janusz Kaminski), Best Adapted Screenplay, Best Original Score (John Williams), Best Editing (Michael Kahn), and Best Art Direction. It also won nominations for two of its male leads: Best Actor (Liam Neeson) and Best Supporting Actor (Ralph Fiennes), Best Costume Design, Best Sound, and Best Makeup. Other organizations including the British Academy Awards, the New York Film Critics Circle, and the Golden Globes, likewise honored the film. It was the first black/white film since The Apartment (1960) to win the Best Picture Academy Award, and the most commercially-successful B/W film in cinematic history.\\"
0316067938|5.0|I couldn't put it down. I'm a 36yr old woman and reading this was my little secret. The story was entertaining from start to finish. All I can say is I wish there was another book after this one, I miss the characters.
0393061310|5.0|At this point, more than a decade after the publication of this book, there's little point in my repeating its basic thesis. Suffice it to say:<br /><br />(1) Diamond clearly loves his topic. He tells his sweeping story in a way that shows he is fascinated about these big questions and excited to give big answers.<br /><br />(2) Despite what other reviewers have said, Diamond never says that his environmental and geographic thesis can account for everything in human history or that other factors were never involved.<br /><br />(3) This is one of the most fundamentally anti-racist books I have ever read. Those who think there is a pro-Western bias here aren't reading the book carefully enough.<br /><br />This is a fascinating book.
B003ZDZ1WG|4.0|I quite enjoy The Band Perry's debut cd, The Band Perry. They write most of their own music, have good lyrics, harmonies, and a fairly unique sound. Here's a breakdown of the songs:    1) You Lie - Fun sing-a-long, hate song to an unfaithful fiancee. Some great one-liners and creative lyrics. 8/10    2) Hip To My Heart - Their fist hit! Another fun song, with Kimberly singing very sassy and declarative. 8.5/10    3) If I Die Young - Wonderfully touching song, superb lyrics. About how Kimberly has led such a good life so far, so she would be okay if she died today. I love this song so much because it's a topic very rarely covered in music, and it is super unique sounding and the lyrics are real and honest. Great song. 10/10    4) All Your Life - The best love song on the cd. Slower song that focuses on vocals more that music production, which works out great in this case! 9/10    5) Miss You Being Gone - not that bad, but You Lie has very similar meaning and is similarly uptempo, and I kinda like You Lie better. But I do love hearing the guys voice for a line on the chorus, it adds a nice touch. 6.8/10    6) Double Heart - I really don't like this song. Stupid and un-relatable lyrics, and the music/beat sounds wrong for the song and is mildly annoying. It's about hating a guy because he got your name tattooed on his arm, and you think he's moving to fast. 2/10    7) Postcard From Paris - Written by the Perry's, Jeff Cohen, and the lovely Kara Dioguardi, this song is sweet. It's pretty good, but not one of the standouts. 7/10    8) Walk Me Down The Middle - Again, no real strong feelings about his one. The music is pleasant, the lyrics are good enough but you probably won't remember this song a day after you heard it. 6.5/10    9) Independence - The more I listen to this song, the more I like it. The chorus is super catchy, and you'll be singing along after just one listen. Even though you won't understand it, because all I heard in the chorus the first time was \\"shooting like a gun, a gun, a gun\\" and then I didn't understand the song at all. But anyway, it's about a small town girl leaving the town of Independence to find her independence. Cool concept I guess. 7.8/10    10) Quittin' You - Love this song. Love the lyrics. Catchy music, hooks, and lyrics. That's a killer combo. 9/10    11) Lasso - Second favorite song on this album. It's a slow song, and oh-so-beautiful. Kimberly's singing is impeccable. On many of their other songs, the lyrics are fairly quirky, and that's what makes them fun and unique. This song is more of an honest, straight-shooting type song, which is a great contrast to the rest. Also, they have some good metaphors here. 9.5/10    Overall, it's a good album. In summary, the best songs are If I Die Young, Lasso, All Your Life, and Quittin' You.   If you like songs you've heard by TBP on the radio, you'll probably like most of the songs on this album.  Happy listening!
B004INNRFK|5.0|Recorded live at Mandalay Bay this picks up where the last \\"Hit Man\\" left off. A few of the performers from that concert return (Kenny  G, Charice) but most of them are other performers that David Foster worked with during the past four decades like Kenny Loggins (whom he first met when he was hired as an audition pianist for Loggins & Messina), Donna Summer, Natalie Cole, Ruben Studdard, All-4-One, Michael Bolton (whom he loves!) and much more. There is also a preview of the new Betty Boop musical he is working on which sounds interesting and much more. I hope he does another one!
B0011NVC98|5.0|Didn't read it when I was supposed to, way back, but this looks like the 'real thing' and is very well made.  The major theme is that people often get ahead partly through some kind of misdeed or succumbing to a temptation, but the consequences will never stop haunting and hurting those you care about.  That's what seemed to resonate with me, at least.  The nudity was not gratuitous and the special effects were great and not overdone as in many movies about 'sagas.' Hope you give it a try and enjoy it.
B0009FJ23C|3.0|Movie is from the book by Aynn Rand and the plot follows that of the book closely - considering that she wrote the screen play I guess you should expect that to be the case even though she later claimed to hate the movie.  The book took Rand seven years to write and get published without any changes by the publisher's editors and it is much better than the movie.  The depth of the characters protraited in the movie is too shallow and the disjunctive scenes makes the movie plot hard to follow.

B002IW8V0E|5.0|The talent, pure talent from souls whom were actors not vocalists-Total entertainment, joy and fun. Thank You. Meryl was well Meryl,completely. Abba, family fun, great story,just makes you feel alive. Singing when you don't feel like it because life has taken over. Disney and there is finally a MOM. A classic.
B002ZG980U|3.0|At first the storyline is confusing, but then you slowly understand the premise of dreams being within dreams. The dream team's main goal doesn't seem important at first but it does take on a sense of urgency as the story unfolds. It also interweaves Dicaprio's character's own dilemma, which is sad. The special effects are fascinating. It's a good mystery, so I liked this movie.

B0016CTX1S|5.0|In all the classic rock I've listened to growing up no one beyond The Rolling Stones themselves have as much range. This album along with the rest of The Stones collection have flown under my radar but when I got this and was listening to it I was amazed. I before had listened to Sgt. Peppers by The Beatles and I admit liked it but as I grew I came to realize that The Beatles although talented individuals in their own right were creating a lot of music that sounds the same and blends into one blah and Sgt. Peppers reflects that. Now this album has all the tracks jump out at you and to me anyway, all these songs can stand alone. Here is my track breakdown:    1. Sing This All Together 3/5 my least favorite sounds to Beatlesque to me but I've heard it has Paul and John in it singing back up.  2. Citadel 5/5 gritty raw guitar with Mick's \\"I'm the singer bastard!\\" singing in it, kind of bluesy psychedelic.  3. In Another Land 5/5 a good \\"Lucy in Sky\\" like psychedelic track that has better lyrical content and musical execution. Truly an unknown great of theirs that hides on this album.  4. 2000 Man 5/5 one of the first split half songs where one half sounds different from the other. The first half gritty solid guitar slinging and the slowed second have kind of bluesy and folky. Truly a great track and one of my favorites on the album.  5. Sing This All Together (See What Happens) 4/5 seriously a trip that seemingly goes by fast.  6. She's a Rainbow 5/5 a touch of orchestral and psychedelic mixed in excellent emotion and one signature piano track this track is one of their elegant legendary licks for a reason.  7. The Lantern 5/5 this leans on the psychedelic folk side with piano that makes it kind of a ballad sounding song. Overall a good track that also makes it apparent that even with an acoustic guitar The Stones can melt your face off.  8. Gomper 4/5 pretty hard to hide the sound of the 60's here with a sitar but still a solid track but not as good as the rest of thealbum, this with Sing This All Together and Sing This All Together (See What Happens) are the few tracks that date this album.  9. 2000 Light Years from Home 5/5 an electronic master piece that rivals Space Oddity by David Bowie gives this album a space like orchestral near closer to this album. This particular track made me want to get this album.  10. On With the Show 5/5 reminiscent of the background singing in Yellow Submarine by The Beatles this is an odd but neat closing to such a nearly timeless album.     Overall this is a great album and because of this album I've gotten hooked to The Rolling Stones licks and I shall get and listen to the rest of their collection. This album has a lot of range compared to other albums at the time. The Rolling Stones to me don't seem to be credited to have so much of a range, but this album reflects a lot of the range they do have. One of the best albums I've heard of all time.
B001NEK2GE|3.0|Build quality is top notch.  Keys feel mushy (is that a word?)  The size of the analog stick is terrible.  Is it to much to ask for a PS3 or XBOX controller type stick?  It would be alot more comfortable.    Overall I just didn't like how this feels.  Why do the key tilt down?  I think it would be more comfortable if the key setup would be tilted like a traditional keyboard.    The LCD screen is a cool concept.  But really... who's going to look down at that screen to find game information when every game displays them on a HUD of some sort?  And if you need that LCD screen to remind you what game configuration you're using well then... you're doing it wrong.
0307388921|4.0|This is the first book I read by Chuck Palahniuk and thought thus far of what I read of his material this was his best work. All be it the only other one I read being Snuff and tried the infamous Fight Club this was better of the three. Now I've gotten Pigmy, Survivor and Haunted sitting on my shelf but this was pretty good. The reason for a 4 star rating is due to this being good but not great. I've read more extensive sophisticated language in other books with a lot more lyrical writing. Overall if you did what I did this book which was read about half of it put down for a while then finish it, it is a grand read otherwise your stuck with a good tale but maybe slightly above average vocabulary and that is reading his descriptions of diseases being a med school drop out.
0670022411|5.0|Really enjoyable read, didn't want to put it down!   Can't wait for the sequel.  Author has a really authentic voice and the characters aren't too corny.  Loved all the surprises and twists.

B00406UK7S|3.0|This could have been a B+ but it was so violent, it started to get comical. Why does Hollywood do this? They get a good topic with great cimatography and ruin it with excessive cheap sensationalism. I give this movie a C+.
0385341679|5.0|The characters in the book were so intense and full of secrets that after finishing the book I felt like the characters were some of my best friends. Barrons is strong, mysterious, and gorgeous. (the man is every woman's dream)  Then you have Mac. She is young and full of pain and hurt when she starts her story. When reading how she got to Dublin my heart ached for her. She was so strong and didn't even know it. It is really rare for me to have that kind of connection to a story, but Karin sucked me into this series quick.     Its hard to describe the story line because of the many surprises and turns the book takes. (with out giving away the whole story)  It starts out with Mackayla Lane, a young woman who's world is torn apart at the news of her only sister being murdered while attending school abroad in Dublin . Mac travels across the world alone to track down her sisters murderer, when she is sucked into a world full of magic and mayhem that she couldn't have imagined in her wildest dreams. Along her journey to avenge her sister, Mac meets the amazing guys and the worst guys. She learns of a world is full of demons and monsters, as well as a covenant of women who are gifted to fight those demons to the death. Mac quickly finds that every one has dark secrets, including herself.     Warning:  This series is considered a romance and has some very graphic adult scenes in it. The book also contains very gory scenes that may not be for every one.
B002ZG9846|5.0|I LOVED this movie! It was darker than what I expected but that's what made it so great! The little girl was amazing...she made the whole movie! I will never buy another bluray from Wal-mart or Best Buy again. Amazon has the cheapest prices  I've seen online and in stores!
B002WJI658|4.0|My 8 year-old is not a collector, so he wanted this purely for playing.  Waluigi is a diffcult villian to find and I was stoked to see this one!  Upon receiving this in the mail, I was surprised to see how nicely this was made!  I purchased this a year ago and it is still as nice as when I first purchased this.  My son isn't a delicate player, so he's a happy camper, too!
B004GGQMRY|1.0|I swear, when an actor is portrayed as a gay or mentally or physically challenged, the actor and then the film is up for Oscar nominations.  I watched this movie for the first time to see what all the hype was.  It wasn't so great.  Dustin Hoffman utters a few grunts of words and maybe speaks a few lines, and Tom Cruise shows himself as a successful but greedy brother claiming that he wants to bring his brother back into his life, though he never knew him before, but you can see that he's basically appreciating his brother's candid card counting skills.  So, of course, they are on their way to Las Vegas.<br /><br />I will say though that this movie does support why I don't gamble.  Casinos love it if you blow your money on chance.  Empty your wallet on gambling and then just go home.  But, if you're someone who has mastered card counting (which I'm sure all casino dealers do), than you are asked to leave.  Even in the movie &#34;21&#34; this has been shown to be true.<br /><br />Anyway, this movie &#34;Rain Man&#34; is a slight hint above mediocre or boorish.  This proves again that I should never put my confidence in Oscar winners ever again.
0061150142|4.0|The Pact is a very emotional book. I love most Jodi Piccoult books, but sometimes the endings are a little depressing to say the least. I was pleasantly supprised to find that The Pact had a somewhat happy ending. I would recommend this book to those of you who enjoy love stories.
B001CD6FKI|5.0|we knew about rain in ninja assassin, so we were looking for more of his movies. this picture is maybe for ''speed racer'' fans, but it's a movie that can enjoy all ages movie fans because it has great actors to begin with,what gives more profesional support to this kind of movies and has a lot of elements that make it very interesting, the colors, the special effects and maybe rain doesn't have a big role but he did very well. and finally this movie make his way to ninja assassin where he play the main character. he's getting better, and he is making his name in the movie business
B0000029D1|4.0|I've tried to play this as background music, but the musicianship and song selection always make me pay attention. I would never have believed that Najee was so wonderful, though I expected pretty much what we get from Stanley Clarke, Billy Cobham, the wonderful Larry Carlton, and Deron Johnson.<br /><br />I'm a guitar nut but somehow I don't end up wandering off when Larry finishes his solo breaks. I get pulled in by Najee and Johnson's work just as much.<br /><br />I would consider this well-worth buying if you like jazz or just like to hear instruments played by a tight group of masters. You *probably* can listen to it while doing other things, but I would warn against it.
031603438X|5.0|Once you figure out the writing style - meaning that thoughts will be completed eventually in the next few pages, the book becomes a great read.  For any rock musician or guitar player it's a must read as the Stones have been blazing trails since day one.  This book covers that trail and if only 50% of it is true, well worth reading. Personnally what has he got to lose, he's sharing a life spent in truly remarkable times, much of it under the influence with the cashflow to keep it going. Like Eric Clapton mention's in his book about putting a palm tree on stage for a leaning post so he wouldn't fall into the crowd, these were the times when the record and management companies had their own rules.    The players, the sessions, the interaction between members, it's the best I've read about \\"Life\\" as a key member of one of worlds top rock bands.  Given that the writing is crude at times (and written from Keith's viewpoint) it's given me a greater appreciation for what the Stones have done for rock music.
B001O2ZW1A|5.0|The album content is five star already! however what makes it more atractive is that second disc is a DVD-Audio with multiple versions: stereo 24bits/48KHz, 5.1 24bits/48KHz and DTS 5.1. If you love hi-fi music you'll appreciate this edition!

B000059GEI|5.0|My brother served in the Navy with Donald O'Connor so this film has a personal connection.

B00008J2PG|5.0|This true story reveals only a small portion of what the Church did or did not do during WW II. History will judge over time.
B000TGJ8CQ|5.0|The plot of [[ASIN:B000TGJ8CQ Next]] is both simple and subtle. Chris Johnson (Nicholas Cage), a Los Vegas magician, can see 2 minutes into the future. A federal agent (Julianne Moore) forces him to use his abilities to find a group of terrorists with a nuclear bomb.     [[ASIN:B000TGJ8CQ Next]] is based on a Philip K. Dick story. Dick's works tended to be cerebral and explore the hidden consequences of odd plot twists, such as the ability to predict the future. This movie obviously doesn't get quite as thoughtful, but it does raise some of the issues, such whether Chris Johnson would merely become a tool of the government if he helped them find the bomb. However, I thought these moral dilemmas were resolved a bit too easily by suddenly allowing him to see further into the future.    Overall, the movie combines action with a provocative plot twist. Nicholas Cage's acting is actually not bad in this movie. I didn't like Julianne Moore's character or the way she plays her. Her agent comes across as an annoying know-it-all. She somehow seems to know more than the rest of the FBI agents combined. Other than that, [[ASIN:B000TGJ8CQ Next]] is an entertaining sci-fi flick, if not quite as thought-provoking as the story it was based on.

B000J10EQU|3.0|Superman Returns(2006) made Superman popular again in 2006, but the film itself was criticized for being \\"boring, sappy, too long, disappointing, etc.\\". Everyone from Kevin Smith to The Simpsons to Epic Movie(2007) has poked fun of it. Superman Returns is a decent movie and it's been unfairly judged. Superman(Brandon Routh) has spent five years in space looking for remains of Planet Krypton. Back on Earth, everyone has moved on without him. Lois Lane has a son and a fiance. Superman must regain his place in the world and stop Lex Luthor(Kevin Spacey)from another diabolical real estate scam.    Director Bryan Singer really put his ego aside to make the film. He also includes references to Superman rip offs such as Puma Man(1980) and Supersonic Man(1979). He also references a Turkish Superman clone made in 1979(Superman smiling through the back window of a car)! We get to hear John Williams' theme music from Superman The Movie(1978). Adventures of Superman cast members Jack Larson and Noel Neill make cameo appearances. The scenes where Superman saves people on a damaged airplane and where Metropolis is shaken by an Earthquake are exciting! Superman Returns does have pacing problems and some flaws, but it's still a solid superhero film.
0316098337|5.0|The premise of ROOM is hauntingly familiar; a young woman is stolen from her college campus by a sexual predator and held captive in his backyard for seven years. As a reader who was fearful of another gruesome tale in the vein of Elizabeth Scott's LIVING DEAD GIRL, I was pleasantly surprised by Donoghue's heartrending and brilliant novel. The story is told through the perspective of Jack, the charming five-year-old born and raised inside his mother's six-by-eleven prison, which he affectionately dubs \\"Room.\\"    Donoghue constructs a consciousness that is poignant, humorous, and never claustrophic.  Jack is as intuitive and obstinate as any five-year-old, save for the fact he has never been in the \\"real world.\\" He alternates between frustration and adoration for his mother (known to reader as \\"Ma\\") and is keenly aware of the depression that threatens her resolve for survival. \\"Today is one of the days when Ma is Gone,\\" he says. \\"She won't wake up properly. She's here but not really.\\"(60).    The Before and After structure of the novel will no doubt be unsatisfying for some readers, but Donoghue handles Jack's awakening with the sort of tension akin to dangling at the top of a free-fall ride. \\"I've been in the world three weeks and a half, I still never know what's going to hurt,\\" he observes (309). And Donoghue certainly knows how to hurt her characters before allowing them to heal. The resulting reading experience will resonate with both older and younger readers.    As a future English teacher, I can't help but hope I will be able to share this story with my students. Despite its uncomfortable subject matter, the narrative is refreshing and full of possibilities for discussion. For 10th-12th grade students, I would suggest a creative writing or visual assignment aimed at emulating Donoghue's use of perspective, as the lively and poetic language of Jack's narrative voice is the novel's most winning feature. The emotionally powerful scenes stem from Jack's inabilityto understand his mother's trauma, so getting students to read between the lines and imagine a world beyond Jack's perception is crucial to introducing ROOM to an English class. I would also recommend breaking students into small \\"literature circles\\" so they may generate their own questions for discussion. It is important to let students take whatever they can from the novel, even if it is as simple as realizing that the things Jack does not say are just as significant as the things he does say, and that there is even beauty in lost innocence.

I could watch it five times a day every day and not get sick of it.<br />I wanted to point out that this particular copy is NOT the Director's Cut, though its rating was changed from \\"PG\\" to \\"R\\". (I feel that this is a more appropriate rating anyways, whether it's Director's Cut or not).<br />I'm very glad it's not Director's Cut...from what I've read about the extra footage I don't care to see it in the least.

I really wish that they'd stick with Kevin Conroy as the voice for Batman...but I might be in the minority on that one.      Overall, a great animated flick and should be part of anyone's collection that loves Batman, DC, adventure cartoons or comic books.

B004HGBUVG|2.0|After listening to this cd three times I'd like to say: \\"You Took My Joy And I Want It Back.\\" I tried to like the music here, but it's too much of a downer.    I have all of her cd's, but this will be my last. This is a big letdown and with all the praise it's getting she'll be sure do another just like it. If she were to ever get happy she would have no lyrics for her songs.     The opening track led me to believe that I was in for some great listening, but out of 12 tracks only 2 move at more than a snail's pace and I've grown weary of her whiny vocal delivery. If you're in a good mood at the start you'll be depressed by the end of this dirgey affair.    I thought that since she was now happily married that her music would be more upbeat and uptempo, but I guess she lives in a permanent funk. I pity the fool who married her.     She should listen to the Free albums \\"Fire and Water\\" and \\"Highway\\" if she wants to hear slow rock done right.
1439102724|4.0|I finished this book in one sitting. The plot moves right along, and doesn't get bogged down in the legal setting. I also like the way Picoult left some ambiguity at the end, rather than tying everything up in a neat little bow. I've read all her books, and this is in my top three.

6305531412|5.0|This great 80's classic was made in 1988 and was directed by Robert Zemeckis and produced by Steven Speilberg.  based on the novel by Gary K. Wolf \\"Who Censored Roger Rabbit?\\", \\"Who Framed Roger Rabbit\\" is a movie about live action cartoons living in a 3d world with us, and work and star in cartoons and movies instead of being drawn.  Roger Rabbit(Charles Fleischer) is a crazy, fun-loving rabbit who as an amazingly attractive wife Jessica Rabbit(Kathleen Turner).  When Jessica is suspected of having an affair, R.K. Maroon, the owner of the cartoon studio, hires Eddie Valiant(Bob Hoskins) to take some pictures of Jessica \\"cheating\\" on Roger with Marvin Acme, the owner of toon town, where all the toons live.<br /><br />When Roger finds out, he goes crazy and runs away, so the next morning when Acme winds up dead, Roger is the prime suspect, and the evil Judge Doom(Christopher Lloyd), who has created a way to kill toons for good by dipping them in an acid-like substance called \\"The Dip.\\"  So it's up to Eddie Valiant to prove Roger's innocence.<br /><br />This movie is great for kids and adults as it has cartoons and funny gimmicks in the movie that will be great for kids, as well as some adult humor.  Which is probably why it received so much praise at the box office.  Many movies combine live-action and animation but this one perfected it.  No movie since has been able to replicate the finesse of making it seem as the animation really ties in so well with the live-action.  It included some very famous cartoon characters interacting with each other that no one had ever seen before and has never seen ever since.  For example, there is a scene where Eddie is sitting at a show watching Daffy Duck and Donald Duck playing pianos together and fighting with each other.  Or later in the movie, where Eddie is falling off a building and Mickey Mouse and Bugs Bunny show up to talk with him.  It was very groundbreaking for its time.<br /><br />The movie received much financial success at the box office and went on to win 4 academy awards, and is one of the most expensive animated films ever made, with a budget of $70 Million.  It's a cult classic that left a huge impact on our culture.  There was also talk of an unproduced prequel, \\"Who Discoverd Roger Rabbit\\".  I'm not sure if it really existed but I do know that they are long overdue for a sequel!and went on to win 4 academy awards, and is one of the most expensive animated films ever made, with a budget of $70 Million.

This original published 1912 book is THEE FOUNDER OF ALL SUCCESS, SPIRITUAL, MENTAL, EMOTIONAL & PHYSICAL books that are repetitively out right now TODAY.  Incase you havent known, the INFAMOUS NAPOLEON HILL'S FAMOUS BOOK \\"THINK & GROW\\" that pretty much made millions of millions of people SUPER RICH / WEALTHY, came from THIS BOOK.  Napoleon Hill himself even wrote a letter to CHARLES HAANEL about severity of what he laid out to the WORLD & for generations to COME (LOOK IT UP ONLINE & YOU'LL SEE THE ACTUAL LETTER YOURSELF).  The only difference is, napoleon pretty much DUMBED it down FOR MILLIONS to easy comprehend it.  But ladies and gentleman, behind the BIBLE........this BOOK is THEE GREATEST BOOK YOU'LL EVER LAY YOUR EYES ON when it comes to HEALTH, WEALTH & KNOWLEDGE ITSELF.  To even make it even more CLEAR AND EVIDENT FOR YOU ALL.........The movie & book called \\"THE SECRET\\", that explains the LAW OF ATTRACTION which many people are aware of now came from THIS BOOK, FROM THIS MAN!!!...CHARLES F. HAANEL 1866-1949.....The ORIGINATOR / CREATOR / FOUNDER of the whole theory of \\"LAW OF ATTRACTION\\".      I cant STRESS ENOUGH ON HOW SERIOUS you people are missing out on.  This IS NOT the typical book to JUST read. Its actually THE MOST POWERFUL MAGNETIC piece of literature you'll ever read if you seriously APPLY it.  Every single BOOK out RIGHT now about the MIND, LAW OF ATTRACTION, SUCCESS, WEALTH, etc........CAME FROM HIMMMMMM!!!!!!!!!!!!. LIKE, DONT YOU GET IT!?!........THIS AINT THE AVERAGE BOOK ladies & gentelman. This is LIKE A BOOK that should be BANNED completely, which actually was a rumor that it was years back. But only selfish people would do such a thing.  But people have no clue that THE THEORY about the LAW OF ATTRACTION came from this man! The bible of course already EXPLAINS THIS COMPLETELY ALREADY FOR THOUSANDS OF YEARS but most people cant understand the bible because it written in PARABLES. But for the people like CHARLES HAANEL, he understood it and like many other POWER LEADERS & WEALTHY MEN. They knew what the SCRIPTURES MEANT, its just some people were GIFTED ENOUGH LIKE CHARLES to elaborate what CERTAIN scriptures MEANT in words people can TRULY UNDERSTAND!    O.M.G. !!! - I REALLYY.....REALLY.....REALLLYYY.....CANT EVEN BELIEVE & STRESS ENOUGH HOW POWERFUL THIS STUFF IS....I'VE READ IT 3-TIMES..LIKE I CAN SAY THIS ONE MILLION TIMES AND I STILL PROBABLY WOULDNT BE AS CONVINCING TO YOU! But let me tell you something........Ima 25yrs kid....with a mind of a 55yr old man...I promise you on my LIFE, I will live up to the ABUNDANCE I HAVE IN STORED FOR ME.....most importantly, the PEACE, HEALTH & JOY that will come along with it which MILLIONSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS of people FAIL TO HAVE NOWADAYS because there are so consumed on there SUCCESS that they forgot on what really is important in life. Why you think the WEALTHY PEOPLE ARE ON DRUGS, COMMIT SUICIDES, DIVORCE RATE IS SKY HIGH, SICK ALL THE TIME...list goes on.    OKAY IM FINISHED!!........    ALL I WILL SAY IS THIS...............

B003EV6DBM|3.0|I enjoyed and thought the story lines were very well done.  Some were a little disjointed, but all in all a great ride!    I really wanted to like Matt Smith but... his intrepretation of the Doctor doesn't portray the age old wisdom of the Time Lords. I certainly do not feel any of the underlying strength that the previous Doctors portrayed and I didn't feel the confidence whereby I know the Doctor will have control of the  situation.  This was very apparent in the earliest episodes where Karen Gillian pointed out key things to the Doctor because he just didn't notice them. There is hope, Matt is likable and could be a good doctor but needs to tweak his portrayal to be less bumbling and give off more inner strength.    After viewing this season, I went back and re-watched David Tennant's series.  Case closed!  His portrayal included the eccentricity with total command and underlying wisdom.  (as did Chris Eggleston and Tom Baker of course!!!)    Come on Matt!!  You can do it!
B004EI2NM2|4.0|I confess I've always wanted to be able to write the story of a relationship in compressed form and Room In Rome accomplishes this brilliantly. In summary it's simple: two women meet in a bar before the movie commences and we see them embark on what should be a simple sexual encounter. But then... half-truths, lies, full truths, sharing of painful past experiences, sharing present joys, the fear of developing love... it's all caught delicately. Every time we think the movie is going in one direction, there's a change of pace, tone and intention.<br /><br />It would be very easy for a film like this to be pretentious but the light direction and sure-footed acting saves the day every time this risk appears to be drawing close. The two women fall in love, almost against their will, and so the morning comes to symbolize both rebirth and also the approaching of the pain of separation. Dawn is Alba's moment, and Dasha promises \\"I'll stay with you till the dawn, and then we'll say goodbye.\\"<br /><br />It's really difficult to manage the intensity of such a scenario, and the longing it involves, but the script and the cast succeed. When the Russian girl Dasha steps away from Alba we really do feel the pain of the moment. Perhaps the only two unrealistic components are (i) the empathy and sympathy each woman has for the other - in real life one or both would tend to cut away to avoid pain; and (ii) the silly \\"arrow in the heart\\" moment that visually depicts the heart-pain Abla feels.<br /><br />Oh, and as the other reviewer has noted, after about the first two minutes we simply stop noticing the nudity of the actresses - the facial expressions, the movements of the hands, are all much more engrossing. The moments of sexual activity are more tender and touching than erotic, culminating in the moment they hug each other in the bath just before Dasha departs forever. It's in no way sexually arousing but it is absolutely arousing of tenderness, love, and the pain of loss-about-to-happen. How many of us have known that moment when the beloved is still present but we know, absolutely know, they are about to leave and never come back?  This is what the bath scene captures so brilliantly: lost possibility, lost love, a sacrifice to the quotidian. At the end of the movie the two women leave the room together, to go their separate ways. An entire relationship encapsulated in a single night.<br /><br />But... at the end the movie cheats. After the women part, Dasha runs to Alba. The obligatory happy ending... without this last moment of capitulation to audience expectations the movie would have earned a five-star review. And the music is great!<br /><br />UPDATE - since writing the original review I've re-watched this movie from time to time and each time it seems to become more poignant. Yes, some of the acting is a bit clunky for a few seconds here and there but overall there's something profoundly touching about the way in which even during the moments of greatest tenderness, greatest excitement of new love, the echo of imminent loss permeates everything. Perhaps I've reached the age where, no longer believing in love, it's come to matter more and more.o-happen.

B002VT6C0K|2.0|I read about this book in a magazine review. I'd never heard of the author but I was looking to branch out so I bought the book. I have to say that I'm really disappointed, it isn't at all what I was expecting. I'm only half way through and I honestly don't think I can force myself to finish it. Most of the stories don't go anywhere, some just end without a real resolution or having made any kind of point. I'm not really a fan of short stories in general because a lot of times, they don't get into the characters in enough depth for my taste and this book is a prime example of that. I walked away from each story feeling kind of gypped, like I've wasted my time. I honestly feel like this book was a waste of money.
B00005JG6Q|5.0|what more can be said about one of the most ground breaking animes of it's time other than it is excellent and a must see.
0380730405|5.0|A can't put it down, page turner of a book. If this book were a flower it would be a hothouse flower, if it were a color it would be a supersaturated fuchsia or magenta. As I read, I am transported back in time to Manderley where I watch, trapped by my anxious curiosity and battle with morality, as the story unfolds in a jumble of reality and fantasy born of obsession and insecurity. Fabulously fulfilling!

0465092764|3.0|I bought this book as I have a passing interest in String Theory as a physics graduate from U.C. Berkeley almost 30 years ago. I haven't done any physics work since that graduation but I still remain technically and mathematically oriented. Skills and memories atrophy after so long, but I was looking for a book that complement \\"[[ASIN:061891868X The Trouble With Physics: The Rise of String Theory, The Fall of a Science, and What Comes Next]]\\" by Lee Smolin, which is a book I quite enjoyed.     As I read Woit's book I was struck by how string theory doesn't appear to address any underlying principals. Einstein described gravity as curvature of 4 dimensional space-time and most of us have seen the bowling ball on the sheet example of how mass curves space, and if you roll a tennis ball to the side of the bowling ball the tennis ball curves because the sheet is deformed. These are physical principals you can imagine, see, and understand. And then Einstein's math works to describe the physical principals. And then one can test it. Einstein's theory has been tested and been proven to be true.     But String Theory starts with the mathematics and attempts to reconcile general relativity with quantum mechanics and electro-magnetism. And this is where Woit loses a fair amount of readability. He tries to describe some very abstract geometric and mathematical principals (advanced principals requiring a Ph.D.) and the reader gets lost in gauge theories, spinors, intantons, Calaubi-Yau spaces, etc. So, yeah, there's all this math going on but where's the physics (which was ultimately his point). But you get lost in it.    By comparison Smolin's book, while also technical, provides diagrams of the concepts, including a clever way to imagine 10 physical dimensions - simplified, of course.    The last third of Woit's book becomes much more readable as he describes the failures of string theory and, in my opinion, the laughably absurd lengths some brilliant and otherwise quite accomplished physicists go to justify a theory that cannot predict anything. In other words, when Woit points out the universe we live in is one out of a possible 10^500 (10 to the 500 power, or 100,000 \\"googles\\") universes in the claimed multiverse the only explanation these physicists (many atheists) can use is that \\"God made it so.\\" Sorry, I'm wrong: we observe the universe as it is as this is the only universe capable of supporting life so of course we observe the physics we observe. (I'm tempted to look up \\"circular reasoning\\"...)     And Woit does a fine job explaining how study of string theory shuts down research in other areas of physics and claims a large portion of government funding that could be used for new, potentially more rewarding research.    To be fair to Woit he writes in his acknowledgments that he wrote the book he wanted to write at the expense of writing a book that could have more commercial success. But the reader doesn't learn this until the end.    So if you're willing to read through some tough mathematical concepts (although I don't recall reading any formulae) and let go of your brain so you can just accept what he's saying you will get a fine overview of the history of quantum mechanics, its successes, and the failures of string theory. Not a bad book at all but the non-technical may struggle with a good portion of this book.
B00004Y2FT|5.0|I love all of Ct's music and it's nice to finally have a cd copy of Watchlar, one of my favourite songs by Cocteau Twins.  This cd makes me want to re-explore their catalouge of music.  I only have Heaven or Las Vegas as of now.  The thing I love about CT is that whenever you get around to listening to them, it's like a breathe of fresh air compared to alot of the music being made today.  Their music puts you in a trance and it's cool to play their music on a rainy day to add to the effect.  the real mystery is what the lyrics are to their songs, but I think that's part of the magic not really knowing the words, you sort of just lay back and experience the mystical world of Cocteau Twins.
1601251831|4.0|I will leave all the general stuff to other people, but the two things that I liked about this book are how they lay out the monster stats and the really helpful indexing system at the back of the book. Both of them were very well done and I have found this book easier to use then some others of this type, and the rather detailed indexing system is something that I have been wanting with a monster manual of this type for ages. Thanks for the good work Paizo.
B002ZG993Q|1.0|This movie made no sense whatsoever.  I was really surprised at how bad it was.  One reviewer here summed it up in 2 words - it stunk !
1601251505|5.0|I'm a bit behind the times here as I didn't know about Pathfinder tell late last year. I will cover three specific things about this book that I liked without delving into a more general review.<br /><br />One of them is that many of the mild modifications made to the 3.5 system are the same as what I have been using with my game for years. Only now its not just a DM rule. The system seems more smoothed then original 3.5e rules. So the changes were well thought out.<br /><br />Second is that this system is compatible with my older books. So that players can still work with the older extended content from our original D&D game. This isn't really a big deal for newer players but does leave open the ability to use a lot of older content from the last ten years.<br /><br />Third and last would be the all inclusive nature of the book. In the past the 3.5e system split what was needed for players and game masters this book works like other table top RPGs with just a single book for both. You really do only need just one book for a full game and that, gives me the idea that Paizo is serious about making this a wooking system.
B0047O2HJC|5.0|As an Dylan fan since the early 1960's, I have followed the evolution of his music with mixed feelings. Lke many of my generation, I related best to his earliest work and less well to it as he 'evolved' into more of a mediocre musician from being the extraordinary poet and musical social commentator that he was. Ina ny event, this set of mono recordings is as true to his earliest releases as I recall. One man, one guitar, one amp and the simply cleaning up (analog) that was state-of-the-art in those days.<br />Early stereo re-releases were basic stereo.... One track for voice and one for sound.  The richness of larger and more sophisticated stereo technology was absent. By the time that came along, the recordings had been remastered to a degree that caused Dylan to be quoted as saying something like, \\"That's me?!\\"<br />These are the sounds I recall.... clear, true and as they were meant to be heard. Not cheap - but few things of value often are.
B001C4AFOY|5.0|The Young Victoria is simply a beautiful film depicting one of the greatest love stories in history.  Emily Blunt gives a simple and straightforward performance and Rupert Friend as Albert is wonderful. I recommend this movie without hesitation.

0439023521|2.0|Perhaps having read 'Battle Royale' by Koushun Takami before reading the Hunger Games somewhat ruined the novelty of the storyline. For those unfamiliar with it, Battle Royale was a Japanese cult classic (that eventually gained mainstream recognition) with the following premise;    The totalitarian nation of Japan has collapsed. At fifteen percent unemployment, ten million were out of work. 800,000 students boycotted school. The adults lost confidence and, fearing the youth, eventually passed the Battle Royale act. Every year, a high school class (42 students) is selected at random by the government and taken to a secure location, where they are forced to kill one another until a single victor emerges. It is meant to quell rebellion and create fear in the general populace.    Somehow, Koushun Takami makes me care more about over twenty individual characters than I cared about Katniss Everdeen. The premise of Collins' novel is hardly original and she does not add any truly unique aspects to her story that capture my attention. I've already read to death the whole 'utopia ruling over the distopia' cliche... I was also unable to relate on an emotional level the trials Katniss faced. If the whole book was supported by the awful reality of forcing children to kill one another... that requires the reader to care not only for the main character, but the victims as well. In a melee that supposedly contains 24 children, Collins decides early not to focus on more than three of them, two of them being the main characters. As this is a young adult book and the first of a trilogy, that detracts heavily from the suspense that otherwise might have been garnered over the fate of the main character.    It is in this fashion that Battle Royale shines and The Hunger Games falters. I felt nothing at all while reading The Hunger Games as young children were murdered one by one without the reader learning so much as their name, let alone any sort of back story. Katniss could very well beprancing through the prairie cutting the heads off of dandelions for all I care. There is exactly one character that creates emotional impact, other than the main two characters.    The book is rather short, and the wording simplistic. I have read my fair share of young adult novels, and Collins is not that impressive in her prose. Also, and call me nitpicky, but I didn't read any sort of review or book summary before reading this book - therefore, I spent a large portion of the beginning of the book unclear on the gender of the main character. There is also no mention made of her looks. From what I can gather, she is white and has long hair. That's it. I could not tell you what color her hair is, what color her eyes are, how tall or short she is. I like to be able to hold a picture in my head of the people and places I am reading. Collins assigns very few physical attributes to her characters, and having finished the book I cannot describe to you what the Capitol looks like, or what her District looks like, or what Katniss' home looks like. No great effort is made by the author to develop her characters and settings into things you can see. I find this incredibly frustrating.    I will not be reading the rest of the series.    In all, I'd recommend someone read Battle Royale over reading this.
B003ITZBVI|5.0|This is one of the best written Batman movies ever.    Excellent storyline, great character usage, good action scenes, great voice casting and amazing animation.    This is one movie worth 100% of the price.
B004HWR406|5.0|What can I say... One of the best movies ever!!!  I was really pulling for Jesse Eisenburg to get an Oscar for his role. If Colin Firth from the King's Speech beat him out, than it must be one heck of a performance/movie. Be ready for the ride of intensity throughout and keeping your blood pressure pumping in anticipation of what will happen next. Eisenburg nailed his character (ambitious,arrogant and ultimately successful.) Supporting cast.. Wow!!!!!  Its a must see!!!!!! Or it goes to Blu Ray/DVD just buy it, you won't be disappointed in the slightest.
B003L20ID8|3.0|I enjoyed this film, but I have to say straight off that it is in a genre and a style that I like. The performances by Matt Damon, Emily Blunt and Anthony Mackie are first-rate and it was good to see Terence Stamp in an important role. The story is pretty well summarized in the comments above the reviews and it would be hard to say more without giving the plot away.    I suspect that this will be a movie that people either like or dislike, with little middle ground. The premise is either intriguing or too bizarre to be taken seriously, depending on each viewer's philosophical convictions. However, the tale is well realized and moves along at a good pace and not the least of its charms is the tour of New York that it gives us.    I only rate it three stars for a couple of reasons. First, the original story by Philip K. Dick was only a novelette and it is somewhat short of twists and turns. Once we have grasped what is going on, which is about a third of the way into the movie, nothing much changes and it becomes a tad predictable. Although this isn't a long movie (it runs 99 minutes) the material is a little thin to keep the audience wondering what will happen next. The other issue is that the ending, although neatly resolved, is a little too pat. There is nothing left for the viewers to decide on for themselves.    I certainly feel this is a good way to spend a couple of hours. You may find that there isn't much to it beyond that.

Christopher is investigating the murder of his neighbor's dog, Wellington, who was impaled on the yard with a pitchfork. Christopher is autistic.<br /><br />Getting inside Christopher's head is a wild trip, and an exhausting one. He has very strict routines and rules\\" \\"Not liking yellow things or brown things and refusing to touch yellow things or brown things. Smashing things when I am angry or confused. Screaming when I am angry of confused.\\" He is unable to perceive emotions. Dialogs are strictly he said/she said affairs. Christopher is writing this book, so of course he doesn't mention emotions: they're foreign concepts to him. Haddon has crafted a strong, memorable voice for his unique protagonist.<br /><br />But Christopher is sharp and resourceful. And he has some very deep thoughts about life and the universe. \\"I think prime numbers are like life,\\" he says. \\"They are very logical, but you could never work out all the rules.

B001TH44VY|2.0|Looking for some musically inspiring, historical entertainment, I was disappointed to discover that the added scenes did not afford clothing. This is NOT family friendly. Its a mix of period realism and distracting porn. It would be more interesting and enjoyable with an operatic narrative approach by references the salacious details of the story rather than cheap and easy nudity.<br /><br />The realism begins in initial scenes at the beginning are somewhat violent as Salieri attempts suicide. As the camera winds through the mental sanitarium the camera captures what is likely an accurate depiction of depravity with various male tenants moaning and wandering nude, partially clothed. As I skipped ahead to the interview between the priest and Salieri, there was an odd contrast in his quarters...clean, quiet, spacious, dignified...didn't even seem like the same movie.<br /><br />Later, I lost confidence in the show when Amadeus' wife came back to solicit Salieri to help Amadeus gain a post for employment. She began to undress... I don't know if there are other similar scenes, but I didn't bother to finish the movie.<br /><br />2 stars for some good acting and great sets and period clothing and some nice Mozart musical performances. Missed a higher rating for not being family friendly, particularly the scenes of nude exhibitionism.
1440503257|5.0|As a casual fan of the Harry Potter series (with many fanatic friends) and an avid cook, trying out this book was a no-brainer. Gotta love when you can infuse something fun like wizardry into every day hobbies.    And, as a bonus, the recipes feature a lot of traditional British flair. I guess no one really gets excited about English food (I avoided it after an unsuccessful try at Branston pickle), but it's worth a try, no matter how unexciting things like \\"treacle\\" sounds. For the record, it's kind of like molasses. Whodathunk?    I tried making pancakes first and was baffled when the book told me to add lemon to milk and let it sit on the counter until it thickened. Why would I want to do that? Does it make it curdle, and wouldn't that be gross? I forcibly turned off my chef sensibilities and gave it a shot, and you know, the pancakes turned out awesome. I don't know what else I could do with that treatment of milk, but now I'm determined to experiment with it.    I would highly suggest this book to any fellow geek chefs. I can't wait to have a wizard-themed dinner party with the bigger Harry Potter fans in my social circle.
B0049OSQ18|3.0|Okay, so this entire album sounds like The Decemberists stumbled upon a few tracks that Tom Petty wrote but decided weren't good enough.  The only track worth mentioning is Don't Carry it All, which is why the lyrics are printed on the inside of the album cover.  I am afraid to say this, but in my opinion, the Decemberists reached their peak with The Crane Wife (which is still one of my favourite albums) and are currently on the decline.  I hope to see them come back with something better than this album full of Tom Petty rejected tunes.
B003Q6D2B4|5.0|What a fun movie. We enjoyed this in the theatre and just had to own it. It is a lot of fun. Very entertaining. \\"Can I kill her now?\\" The Mythbusters would have fun with a number of the scenes in here, but that is what makes the movies so much fun.
B004HD2ZIQ|1.0|Motorhead are supposed to be the band that kills the grass on your lawn, right? So since when did they become the band that's less interesting to listen to than watching that grass grow? Maybe it would be disingenuous to expect such an institution in rock to push any boundaries or take any chances, but I think it's worse that they repeat themselves. Bands at this point in their career are appreciated for the same blase reasons as new age music; the music is inoffensive and willfully nostalgic, and just fills space in a way that doesn't make you angry. Feeling dead inside yet? Please find something more challenging.
B00319ECGU|5.0|WOW, I can't believe how well these came up for movies circulating in the 70s. I thought I was sitting in the theater first run.  Except for the clothing of course. LOL   These are absolutely gorgeous.   Not all re-releases look this good and crisp in Blu-ray.  Amazing job for this set. A few people mentioned giving these as gifts.  What a GREAT gift!  But I didn't mind paying for mine, especially for that price.

B003UESJH4|4.0|The intimate look at the life of stuttering prince who soon finds himself the future King of England after his older brother, Edward VIII, abdicates the throne for an American divorcee.  Edward was the only monarch to abdicate the throne since the time of the Anglo-Saxons.  In other words a long time ago.  The quality of this picture is amped up by the quality actors, including the supporting cast.  Colin Firth won the Oscar for his portrayal of Prince Albert (Bertie) who lated would become George VI, whose eldest daughter, Elizabeth, would take the throne as Elizabeth II.  Nice touches on the prince's ailment and very nice interplay between Firth and Rush with a focus on the intimate life of the prince.  This picture was nominated for 11 AAs and won 4, most notably Best Picture.  STORY/PLOTTING: B plus; CHARACTER/DIALOGUE: B plus to A minus; EVOKING THE ERA: B plus; MY GRADE: B plus; WHEN WATCHED: end of Feb. 2011.
B003L20IFQ|1.0|SPOILER ALERT!!!    This movie is leaving me with nightmares. I was left hoping throughout the entire film that something positive would occur. There are three if at most four suspenseful moments in the film all of which make you cringe in hope this guy comes out alive. Well he doesnt....so whats the purpose in seeing a film like this?! If you want to enjoy the movie for its cinematography then thats about all you're going to get out of it. It takes place COMPLETELY INSIDE A BOX. Therefore there is no bigger picture or excitement or anything other than sadness and hopelessness in the end. I would NOT recommend this to a friend. I rather have watched another movie. I wish I could have my 1hr and 30 minutes back.
B000LTAY1U|1.0|I read several of the reviews before purchasing this watch. I knew some had a tendency to run a little fast. Mine worked great for almost 2 months. It kept perfect time. Then one morning it stopped working. The second hand would stop in the 4 o'clock position. I shook it a little and re-set it. It ran less then a minute and stopped again. I shook it again. Now, it started running,,,,real fast. It gained about 10 seconds EVERY MINUTE. It gained over 4 hours in 1 day. I let it run down, re-set it and tried again. No luck it continues to run very fast, or not at all.  It is a shame it does not work correctly because it is a good looking watch, and I really liked it ( for 2 months). Now I have to figure out who to send it back to for repair or replacement.
1439190275|5.0|We started on the Atkins Weight Loss Program the 3rd of February and this book has been extremely valuable to us. We read about the Atkins Edge, the allowable foods on the Induction Phase, how Atkins works and how to maintain a healthy lifestyle while loosing weight.  Great book!
B0034G4P7G|2.0|It's an OK movie as long as you go in knowing that its not a factual story. The movie wasn't near as good as i thought it would be, in fact, i was quite let down after finally seeing it and listening to all the hype.  I agree with another reviewer.....this movie could have been so much better if they went after more of the \\"real story\\" rather than making up half of it. Another thing was that the drinking and goofing off was way over-acted, making you think this was nothing more than a bunch of drinking and laughing stunts gone good. Also, the part of Sean Parker, was way over-done as well, portraying him as only an out-of-control partier and womanizer trying to take advantage of Facebook.  2 stars....at best.
B00475AYJQ|1.0|Not worth the money. Disappointing. I have no intention of continuing this series. This installment was a complete waste of time. There was no plot development.<br />Most of this book consisted of a nerds wet dream. Beautiful women warriors, and a beautiful fea creature that don't care who they have sex with. Half the book can be summed up in three words. Nerd Pity Sex.<br /><br />Not to mention that he tried and failed to emulate other author's styles. His failed attempt to copy Jordan's descriptions of sword fighting was horrendous. I was constantly cringing at his attempt to copy Jordan. He failed to create a believable description system for the sword fighting.
B004HYDL1K|5.0|Machete is a parody of a parody of a parody and it is extremely fun. Machete is a throwback to the old \\"grind-house exploitation\\" movies that tried to have a plot (which were always awful) and sometimes even a \\"massage\\" (which were terribly portrayed as well, although one understood what the \\"message\\" might be, whether it be as simplistic as \\"don't brake the law\\", or more sensitive subjects such as \\"rape\\", etc. In this case Latinos, which in some instances ARE being mistreated in this country, \\"illegal\\" or not, is part of the \\"plot\\" and \\"message\\"). In the 1970's these types of movies were seen, or at least attended to, for pure fun (and if one had a significant other, to play fun \\"games\\" in the darkness of the theater). And this is what Machete (along with Planet Terror and Death Proof) was intended as: a cheap, fun, exploitation flick. If these types  of movies are \\"terrible\\" that's because they're SUPPOSED to be \\"terrible\\".
0142000671|1.0|After the title I am with those that find the characters, story, ending, everything about this book without any interest. Personally I'm unable to fathom the good reviews this relatively boring book gets.
0060922583|5.0|It was with great anticipation that I awaited this book in the mail. It didn't disappoint! Michael Talbot was a great author, and I mourn his passing. He covered material about quantum physics and that our brains are holographic in their processing, and then talked about how our universe is holographic in nature. Talbot quoted the experts, and he revealed his personal experiences. He talked about psi phenomena, he was psychic, and talked about the research in that area. Talbot tied all of that together in one neat and very inspiring package. The Holographic Universe is now my number one favorite book!
0756404738|4.0|Judged against the first book in the series, I am forced to say that Wise Man's Fear is not as good. But judged against normal, mortal books - it's fantastic. An excellent book that I could not put down. I fully recommend it.     Compared with the first book: (*possible spoilers*)    The Good:    Wise Man's Fear is a funny book, and a sexy book. It had me laughing out loud numerous times, and hoping that I will one day get to watch an HBO production of the book.     The Bad:    The first book had a nimble and enchanting flow, moving from mystery to magic to thrill and adventure easily. Where other stories have killed important characters and I felt nothing - Name of the Wind had me crying over a broken lute. It was fully engaging and emotional.     Where the first book was nimble, Wise Man's Fear at times felt forced - as if the transitions from adventure to adventure were jarring and unnatural. Where the first book had many touching moments, the sequel has fewer and with smaller emotional impact.     The Indifferent:    Wise Man's Fear moves more slowly than the first. Don't get me wrong, I'm not some teenager with A.D.D. who can't sit still for 3 seconds. I take profound pleasure in character development, a thing that is increasingly rare in modern entertainment. I have no complaints about the length of the book or the time spent getting to know new characters. I'm just pointing out the contrast with the first book.
B001UV4XFQ|4.0|The movie is enjoyable and a great escape.  I have to say that I enjoyed the book better than the movie, more detail.
B0019LY5IM|5.0|This is my all time favorite TV show. I can't really tell you much more about this purchase but I guess I am happy about it.
B001ED7C58|4.0|I really enjoy the music on this soundtrack.  There is only one or two songs that I skip over from time to time.  Love the baseball scene song by Muse.
B001ECQ6E2|4.0|Quo Vadis is an entertaining film that although is a bit slow from the start draws all its force to a powerful conclusion. I think Robert Taylor was miscast for this film as he doesn't give off much of a presence, still the mind blowing sets and Ustinov make up for that and overall this film is a grand scale of old Hollywood film making that is long gone.
0140714855|5.0|It was fine I wanted a used book and I got one. It was perfectly content. It got here on time so everything was fine.
B000R209NY|4.0|I didn't mind this modern take on The Poseidon Adventure, I found it quite an entertaining film that although really adds nothing new except for jazzier special effects, it does entertain none the less, Josh Lucas is fun to watch at heroics too.  Give this film a float, it's worth it.
0312117337|2.0|these cards looked good on the computer screen, but when you have them in real life they are made from the cheapest cardboard material. Even the less expensive Universal Waite tarot set has a glossy finish and better card stock. The Osho zen tarot doesnt have a glossy finish and just feels cheap. also the book that is included has typos and not really useful for anything other than to fill up space so it looks like your getting more for your money. For $18 i expect something better. this set should be worth $10, no need for the oversized box/book. that said the artwork on the cards is well done, but this set is too expensive.
B002XMGGK6|1.0|Stupid story and violence for the sake of violence pushed from the word go, it's a movie you would sit through once and then wonder why you sat through it as your IQ starts to recover from such an idiotic film. Just rent it if you must but don't add it to your collection, you won't watch it again as your brain will know better the second time around.
031603438X|4.0|Always have been amazed how Keith Richards kept going.  I haven't finished this book but looks very, very interesting!
1451564309|1.0|I love \\"Little Women\\" by L.M. Alcott. It's a great book. Unfortunately whoever published this version left it full of spelling and punctuation mistakes! I can't believe it's sold like this. Didn't someone edit it???   Very dissatisfied and will be returing it.
B0015DYIH2|5.0|Obviously this book is perfect.  I write because I can not believe that some people have read ALL FOUR books and are still giving one star. Why would they read all of the books if it was soooo terrible with each book.  Please people.
B0042U94UQ|5.0|Loved the video!  It was great!  Amazing story line as entertainment!  Family Friendly as well!  An all-around cute story of learning what success is.
B003EY7IRC|3.0|I was expecting a lot from this book since by the last book, I was truly hooked. You do get closure to alot of the questions that you invested in for the last four books. However, I didn't really like lot of the turns this book took like when Mac decided to hook up with the bad guy because she thought Barrons died and it was literally like an hr later. Oh come on. Then there was the explanation of her connection with the book...which was almost confusing because I could have come up with a way better storyline and when you have invested so much time in to reading the series, you almost expect a better explanation. I'm very happy with the ending with Barrons and Mac however I thought there would be more time together with them. It could have been written better in more detail instead you get \\"and we spend a whole month making love\\"...boring. Christain ends up being a jerk which I didn't think was necessary. And V'lane ending was great! Overall I am satisfied with the book but there are lot of changes that I would have made if I was the author. I do recommend reading this book if you have read the rest of the books!
B0000X61UU|5.0|This is one of the best workouts I have ever done and I have incorporated the exercises into my \\"freeform\\" exercise sessions for years.  I was so happy that this became available on DVD.  I have had the VHS since the mid-90s and my dual VHS/DVD now only plays DVDs.<br /><br />I like the 10-repetition set-up to maintain maximum variety and I find it encourages me to push myself because, hey, I can do that, I just need to do it 10 times! It's interesting that I've seen more plyometrics in the last 5-8 years in other videos and settings, but they've been in this video for 18 years!<br /><br />Overall, I like the variety, the challenge, and the style of this video.  The music and settings only feel slightly dated, but have a lasting quality.  Cindy Crawford is a good host for this video.  She's down to earth and \\"human\\" in showing that she's pooped from some exercises.  It's a good break from the \\"perkier\\" options out there.
B004Q3UL2O|3.0|This wasn't a bad movie, but definitely not one to add to the Blu Ray collection.  I thought it was going to be less of a love story and more about how corrupt the pharmaceutical industry is.  Always enjoy Anne Hathaway and Jake Gyllenhaal.
1423101502|5.0|Kronus' forces are massing for the final attack on Mount Olympus (The Empire State Building). Will Percy, Annabeth, Grover, and the other demigods be able to overcome the in-fighting and mysterious prophecies and save both Olympus and all of Western Civilization? The fantastic young adult series concludes with the exciting, page-turning action, refreshing and original humor, and, most importantly, the clever reworking/reimagining of Greek mythology in the modern world, that made the series so fantastic and justifiably popular. (I cannot tell you the joy I have that an entire generation of children are growing up knowing the equivalent of a college course in Greek mythology.) A wonderful hero tale, with the spirit and universal meaning of classical literature, complete with clever twists, surprises, and themes (particularly the definitions of family, where abandoned children demand respect and acknowledgement from their godly parents). A brilliant conclusion to an original, clever, and entertaining series. Grade: A
B0042RJWTM|4.0|This is another movie I've hunted for, for a long time.  I'm an avid fan of Lee Marvin.  I grew up on a ranch in Oklahoma and lived the \\"cowboy life\\" for my first 19 1/2 years (with the exception of the gun play of course!) so I could relate to alot of the movie.  For the most part it was pretty realistic.  My father used to tell me stories that his father had told him about the open range and what happened as it was fenced in.  Hollywood usually romanticizes the cowboy's life an' it just wasn't that glamorous!  It was tedious work with long days and cold nights. Western fans will want to add this one to their collection...  I did.  The price is reasonable.
B003VDZWAQ|5.0|I think this is a good series when you watch the first couple of episodes I wasn't sure if I wanted to continue watching it because it started out a bit slow, but when everything started falling into place and you and I started understanding more it got really good. I think I will continue to watch and can't wait for season 2
B002ZG9774|5.0|I would not be afraid to take a 12 year old girl to see this, as there are some lessons here<br />and it is not a movie about being baudy.<br />The music, dynamic singing and star-powered energy give this movie an A+++ in my book!<br />The cast is CONTINUALLY & PERPETUALLY UNSTOPPABLE.
B0042816YK|5.0|I watched movie first with a friend while on vacation, I then read the book and loved both. Have since read Committed (also by Gilbert) and enjoyed all. I now look forward to watching the movie of Eat Pray Love again (Julia Roberts did an excellent job, as I expected).
0765326353|4.0|The title of this review really says it all.  I wasn't just pleasantly surprised by Sanderson's Way of Kings, I was downright shocked at its awesomeness.<br /><br />I've read all of Sanderson's published books by this point and have been critical of many of them (Mistborn book 1, notwithstanding).  Yes, this book makes some of the same mistakes as those others:<br /><br />1. A handful of brutal typos<br />2. The bad guys do exactly what you expect supposed to with token twists.<br />3. Too much unrealistic preaching by the characters used to bludgeon the dumb reader over the head with the author's points<br />4. Too many easy reveals<br />5. He tries to be too clever with his \\"witty conversations\\" which often fall flat and reek of trying too hard (especially Shallan)<br /><br />But, man, do I SO not care. Usually things like that would drive me nuts and distract me from getting pulled into the book but with Way of Kings I had no problem being fully absorbed. I enjoyed the entire read and flew through the book, never feeling the urge to skim (which is increasingly rare these days).<br /><br />The characters, atmosphere, and events of the book (as well as the depth of well developed history and cultures hinted at, not to mention some really cool ideas) made this book an absolute pleasure to read.  It left me wanting more like Mistborn or even the best of GRRM or Erikson.<br /><br />Kaladin especially was compelling (though the flashbacks could drag) with fantastic, palpable character development and very believable motivations (not to mention his uniqueness as a character).  His entire sequence was filled with action and some remarkable scenes as he battled to find a way to save his bridge team.  Great stuff.<br /><br />The Kholins were similarly fun to read being relatable and sympathetic (Dalinar's later flashbacks were some of the most interesting scenes).<br /><br />Even the ending could be forgiven its occasional predictability because it served the greater purpose of creating a great push to a very fitting end that set up well for books to come.<br /><br />I can't wait for the next book of the Stormlight Archives!  Let's just hope Sanderson doesn't butcher it like he did the Mistborn series...<br /><br />Note: I just finished reading and tossed this review up.  I will probably edit it for coherency at some later date.ooks to come.    I can't wait for the next book of the Stormlight Archives!

B0034G4P7G|3.0|an easy film to watch, pertinent to the idea of stumbling onto great ideas, following intuition and remaining true to yourself.
B0040YFR1Y|5.0|I was very happy about how quickly my order came and the condition that it came in.  Thanks!!!! :)
B002ZG97EC|5.0|This movie is so cute and funny. I love it. I bought it from Amazon cause it was the lowest price compared to Best buy, Walmart, or Target.
B004Q3SGWG|4.0|If you immediately think a film about one guy getting stuck and having to cut his arm off to escape is treacherously gross and boring, then watch this film. If you had no respect for James Franco before, watch this film. It's good! Not too gory! Nice scenery! Well. It's gory in that one part. When he cuts his arm off.
B003MC5N28|5.0|I decided to read this book because several people compared The Hunger Games to this. I can see why people would think that Suzanne Collins had been inspired with the story of The Hunger Games from this but it's not the SAME story as some have said. Both books are Young Adult but are still great stories no matter what a person's age.<br /><br />I do like this book and it's scary to think of a future like what is portrayed here. I hope that our society never turns into something as horrifying as this. Even though it's not a \\"slap ya in the face\\" kind of scary, it is frightening if you really think about how it could be. I hope I never have to live a life of \\"sameness.\\"
B0000AQS0F|5.0|My husband introduced me to this quirky little series, and I've grown to love it. The characters are continually interesting, some hilarious (think Jayne), and I don't understand why it didn't catch on. And, the bigger question: Since it's so popular now, why don't they bring it back??!!  Every single episodes brings tension, some dumb moves, and finally, the understanding of what's been going on all along. I recommend this series to anyone who likes a chuckle along with their drama. It's going to break my heart when we finish the final episode! Watch it!!
B000002699|5.0|Este cd es una producci&oacute;n muy interesante ya que se realiz&oacute; por los a&ntilde;os 60, &eacute;poca experimental para el jazz y donde Miles dej&oacute; una gran influencia para la posteridad musical.<br />Podemos apreciar dos temas de larga duraci&oacute;n: \\"SHHH/PEACEFUL\\" de caracter desenfadado y casi c&iacute;clico donde una pl&eacute;yade de m&uacute;sicos como Hancock, Corea, Holland, Zawinul, McLauglin, nos introducen en un mundo m&aacute;gico de sonidos y donde Miles - con pocas notas - nos deja en un efecto casi hipn&oacute;tico.<br />\\"IN A SILENCE WAY/IT'S ABOUT THAT TIME\\", la m&uacute;sica se vuelve m&aacute;s pac&iacute;fica, casi contemplativa, jugando con efectos arm&oacute;nico flotantes, para luego dar rienda suelta a un ritmo contagiante interpretado por estos grandes artistas.<br />Un disco realmente buc&oacute;lico del gran genio de la trompeta. A disfrutar!!!
1439152780|5.0|In her third and latest novel, The Distant Hours, Kate Morton delivers an unforgettable tale that takes us to a great home in England around the time of World War II.<br /><br />It opens with the delivery of a long lost letter which drives young Edie Burchill to investigate Milderhurst Castle, a once grand estate in England, where her mother had once been billeted as a thirteen-year-old girl during World War II. Edie is drawn to Milderhurst and its owners, the three Blythe sisters.  The elder Blythe sisters are twins and have spent most of their lives protecting their youngest sister Juniper who hasn't been the same since a fateful night in 1941.  As Edie unravels the mystery of her mother's stay at Milderhurst, she uncovers the truth behind the mysterious tragedies that have haunted the Blythe family for decades.<br /><br />The Distant Hours is an engrossing read full of family secrets and betrayal- equal parts mystery and historical fiction.
B000CNDIZE|5.0|This is another brilliant album from Sia. She may be best known for 'Breathe Me', which I love with a passion, but this album delivers so much more. It is perfect dinner party background music, but need not be relegated to that alone. I find it great to kick back at night and put this (or her live album 'Lady Croissant' which is also fantastic) on and relax to her smooth, beautiful voice and let my cares slip away. If you know her from Zero 7, or even just from 'Breathe Me', this album is well worth a try, you will not be disappointed.<br /><br />Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page.
0385040253|5.0|I purchased this book for my husband, and when he opened the box, he loved it. He had always secretly wanted it and had never mentioned it to us. The book was everything it said in the reviews. I purchased it at a great price. I am happy with the purchase.
B0001XAPY2|4.0|This is yet another brilliant animation from the Ghibli stable. It has the high quality animation we've come to expect, and has some amazing airplane and flight scenes. The story is a little slower than most Ghibli films (hence only four stars) and I found myself a little bored in the middle, but it is well worth persevering with. It is one that could be enjoyed by kids as well as adults and the talking pig makes for some amusing scenes. Worth a try if you're fan of Ghibli and Japanese animation.<br /><br />Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page.
0670022411|3.0|You will like this book if you like:<br />1. Female POV paranormal romances.<br />2. Long chases after paranormal artifacts (a book in this case) that is not found in the end.<br />3. Interesting probing discussions paralleling real scientific fact in an exploration of the root of (still not outed) paranormals; witches, daemons, and vampires.<br />4. Sloooow cooker vampire romances.<br />5. YA book endings... nothing is really resolved and ends on a cliffhanger.<br />6. A nice long thick book that gives you time to get to know the characters (my kindle said it was over 11500).<br />7. The characters had a mixture of admirable and not so admirable traits, leading to a more realistic characterization of characters.<br />8. The main character and her romantic lead had a \\"the one\\" prophecy vibe.<br />9. Only one instance of poor editing where it stated she knew something (about a breaking and entering) that we didn't think she knew and was touched on again at the that she didn't know. It was confusing for me.<br /><br />You may not like this book if like:<br />1. Female POV Urban Fantasy.<br />2. Lots of loose ends that hints to time travelling in the next book to (sigh) Kit Marlowe's time. How many other books have done this???<br />3. Books that deal with a few key issues and don't try to be everything in one book (but still manage to accomplish a lot.) This book begs, borrows, and steals a lot from the UF/PR genres - trying to be everything. If it is a series, maybe parts of it should have been revealed in the next book.<br />4. The romance (for a 30 something female) was very YA to mean. While I don't want everything in 1 book, the proportion (substantial) dedicated to the romance portion of this novel made me feel there was a lot of \\"fooling around\\" (i.e. heavy petting) and wasted page space for any real explorations of the origins of the paranormal races.<br />5. Books that manage to solve the problems in 1 book while leaving a few mysteries for the next. There were no Scooby Mysteries in this one to solve other than an identity crisis, that is resolved in 1 letter from her deceased mother.<br /><br />Viking Adult: Really? I think if you are a teenage girl who loves vampire romances, then you've hit the jackpot!!! But if you prefer a lot of magic theory, challenging story lines, with a leading female who is 30 something who is a dynamic character then read elsewhere. Heck, if you are looking for elusive magical books read the \\"Fever\\" series by Moning - At least in that series that magical book stalked Mack! I'm giving this book three stars because it was a decent PR.ty crisis, that is resolved in 1 letter from her deceased mother.    Viking Adult: Really?

B000TERDNO|5.0|This is a great collection of Billy Idols music and the best place to start if you're new to him. It has all of his best and well known hits and is perfect eighties nostalgia, as well as being great rock music as well. You'll be surprised at how many tracks you know and at how good his voice is. The last two new tracks of a live acoustic 'Rebel yell' and 'Don't you (forget about me)' are particularly good and an excellent way to finish a top CD of rocking music. Well worth a try.<br /><br />Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page.
1400063736|4.0|This is a wonderfully complex and somber novel, but beautifully written.<br /><br />McCann uses the story of Phillipe Petit, the French acrobat who walked a wire strung between the twin towers in 1974, to illustrate man's resilience, even in the face of great obstacles.<br /><br />He further illustrates it through the lives of \\"normal folks\\" going about their business hundreds of feet below the high wire, down on the varied streets of New York. Regardless of their backgrounds and socio-economic status, they all struggle with unique issues and yearn for connection with another human being. And as the novel unfolds, we learn that all of their lives are interconnected...not just by a shared witnessing of the high-wire walk, but through a series of events that unfold around it, none of which could have been predicted.<br /><br />Let the Great World Spin is a story of love and loss, of \\"life passing through difficulty in order to achieve any modicum of beauty,\\" and the human ability to find meaning even in the greatest of tragedies. It is not a light read - it takes some focus to realize the interconnectedness of the many protagonists - but it is a rewarding read, one that will get you thinking about your own place in this world as it spins round and round.
0007229674|5.0|I really enjoyed this book by Ramsay. It is very readable and he comes across as supremely passionate about his cuisine and career. It is written in his own style and reads almost as he would say it. The details of his life, his upbringing, culinary education and family dynamics make for engrossing reading and this makes for an easy couple of days reading without any deeper pretensions. Well worth a go.
B0049P1VHS|5.0|I have watched all six episodes and it did make me jumped off the couch with one scene.  I was sure I wrenched my knee flying off the couch.  It looks like they had a lot of fun making this and I hope there is another season.  It is not your typical zombie show.  It actually has a plot.  It is also a cliffhanger.  I like the characters; except for the wife, I agree, she is weak and they need to boost her character up a lot.  I find the hillbilly character very good.  He gets the job done and he is not the stupid one in the group.  It will be interesting to see if they continue the sequel.  It does keep you on your seat and in suspense.  It would definitely not want to miss a show as it comes each week.  I like seeing how they get out of each situation they come upon.  It has potential.  Seeing the First Season makes me want to see another one.  I hope they bring it back.
1844137872|5.0|This is a brilliant book looking at the humorous, sometimes political, occasionally caustic and often thoughtful artwork of Banksy. It shows his most famous pieces, as well as demonstrating just how influential his style has become. This book has some fantastic commentary and quotes from Banksy that really add to the overall package and make you realise the ideas behind the art and artist. I found the paper quality to be excellent and I have to say I enjoyed this book more than expected and it left me with a new, deeper appreciation of Banksy's work. Highly recommended.<br /><br />Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page.
B00475AYJQ|5.0|Let me start with saying that Patrick Rothfuss (PR) has created one of, if not the most tangible and surreal environments in storytelling I've ever encountered.  An unfortunate downside is that after you read PR, it wont be  easy finding other authors who have contributed works on the same level.  Speaking of which, the fact that PR is so new to fantasy seems to work in his favor.  He's hungry to make a great story that others enjoy.  He isn't simply coasting on past success and churning out books to get those $$.      To be honest it's not easy to pinpoint exactly why I enjoy his books so much.  As other readers have mentioned, his prose is among the best I've ever seen.  His characters don't simply come to life, they are alive.  Their thoughts and actions are realistic and they don't act without justification.  What I mean is, it's far easier to create a world and then construct bizarre happenings through characters which seem capable of anything and everything.  Think of the TV show LOST.  PR's world and characters are every bit as dynamic and believable, but all the more so because each character acts within the realm of his/her personality.  And what amazing and unique personalities they are.      I simply have a hard time imagining someone who enjoys a good fantasy book not liking PR.  The magic system is robust and makes sense.  There is a well defined set of boundaries that gives magic a sense of meaning and impact.  Once again, everything from the story itself to the characters coming alive in their very own and unique manners is an example of fiction done right.  As an example, I'm half tempted to get on facebook and check Kvothe's page to see what he's up to these days.  That's how real his characters are.
B000002BFL|5.0|This is one of Springsteens best albums. It is in the same vein as 'Nebraska' and has echos of 'Devils and Dust' to come. It is supremely chilled out and very relaxing to listen to, his voice perfectly pitched to tell the stories in each song. This album contains such gems as the title track, 'Youngstown', 'Dry lightning' and 'Best wasn't good enough' to end the album on a perfect note. I tend to feel that the album is best listened to in it's entirety to get the full benefit from it though. This is Springsteen doing what he does best, which is telling a beautiful story, backed by great music, simple as that. Don't buy it expecting the Stadium anthems of the 80's, but do expect some of the best music that Bruce has ever put out.<br /><br />Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page.
0439813786|5.0|I learned of this book through a strange set of circumstances.  When I read the reviews here, I simply had to have it.  My list of reasons for loving it is long.  It is delightful, whimsical, heart-felt, poignant, alluring, suspenseful, mysterious and beautiful.  It brought back vivid and much beloved memories of my son as a young boy, drawing.  As an adult, he now loves film and film history, so I shared the book with him and he loved it as well.  A wonderful engaging read--ages 8-100+.
B000P0J024|5.0|This is probably one of the most fun albums you'll ever own, period. The music is light and toe tapping and the lyrics are sung with tongue firmly in cheek. The blend of voices and styles are spot on and you'll find yourself beaming everytime you put on this CD. The DVD has some great footage of the albums being recorded, as well as some music videos. The extra tracks aren't too great, but are good for those who want more from the band. I can not recommend this album highly enough, I grew up on it and I love it just as much now. After years of being a deleted title I recommend you snap this up before it gets lost again!<br /><br />Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page.
030746363X|3.0|It might be me but I had a tougher time following Tim.  4 hour work week was so focused ... 4 hour body seemed to jump around.  Between the very scientific sections to various advice on workouts I just didn't think this was great.  I did glean quite a few ideas though and I love all the references and resources after each chapter.
0061122416|5.0|Coelho's most famous book and the first one I read. This is fairly typical of his style and offers his usual words of spiritual wisdom in an easy accessible (almost fairy story style) read. His books are very simplistic, but have some interesting philosophy and some nice ways of phrasing timeless ideas. As long as you expect an easy, innocuous read, and don't expect the lofty spiritual read often touted, then you should be fine. This is a great story, with beautiful sentiments and is worth it for that alone.<br /><br />Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page.
B004EQAVHI|5.0|28-year old Kathy H. (Carey Mulligan) reminisces about her life, starting with her unique boarding school, Hailsham.  The children were raised strictly but well cared for and raised to know they have a valuable purpose in life.  A distressed new teacher tells the children what that purpose is, but it seems they already know and accept it utterly.<br /><br />I was completely shattered by this movie; it left me shocked and saddened and very, very frightened. It's about a world in which people have extended life spans thanks to the likes of Kathy and her friends who comply with their inescapable duty, much to our horror.  Mulligan is wonderfully subtle and convincing. The script is clever and intriguing, and terrifying in its realism.<br /><br />This is an exceptional sci-fi story similar in tone to \\"1984,\\" and it's also a tender love story.  If you're looking for a thought-provoking, well-made movie, you'll enjoy \\"Never Let Me Go.\\"
B0006J28BO|5.0|This is a great film, perfect for lazy Sunday afternoons. I tend to feel that this film is aimed more toward a younger audience, although that didn't stop me enjoying it. You get the usual high quality Ghibli animation and film score, as well as a quaint story that is inoffensive and rather charming. It isn't as innovative as other Ghibli films, but it is another fine film from the respected Japanese studio. Well worth a try if you're a fan of anime.<br /><br />Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page.
B0042816YK|1.0|As an Australian,I must say that this film exemplifies some of the worst characteristics a hollywood studio wants the rest of the world to think about American women.  Shallow,narcissitic,selfish,mired in'comfort',regarding poverty as 'picturesque'[and avoiding it like the plague in India and Bali except for one sight of the ride from the airport in the case of the latter].  I wouldn't be suprised if Al Quaeda used it as part of their recruiting drivel.  It really is awful and while my wife and I watched it in elequent surprise,I reflected on the beautiful shots of the luxury ashram in India and resort in Bali, thinking of the thousands of unsung people in the world who actually do good for other people,the thousands who travel to really meet 'ordinary' people and try to help their environments.  Such a morally twisted work as this does very poor service to the view of the American middle class.  Perhaps big American studio bosses should leave deep and serious thinking to the British.  Very few of them seem capable of it.  This is why the  best American film of the last ten years remains Scorseses' 'Aviator' .A wonderful film.
0007270968|5.0|I really enjoyed this book by Ramsay. It is very readable and he comes across as supremely passionate about his cuisine and career. It is written in his own style and reads almost as he would say it. The details of his life, his upbringing, culinary education and family dynamics make for engrossing reading and this makes for an easy couple of days reading without any deeper pretensions. Well worth a go.<br /><br />Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page.
0689865384|4.0|I'm a female seventh grader. Uglies by Scott Westerfield is a realistic book set at least 300 years into the future in a world of extreme beauty. Everyone follows an ideal standard beauty and when teenagers turn 16, they undergo an operation to make them pretty. These teenagers move to Pretty Town where they can party and play without worries, schools, or rules. Teens younger than 16, otherwise known as uglies, look from Uglyville at Pretty Town. Bored with nothing to do, the uglies scheme roguish tricks on each other.    Tally Youngblood, the main character, yearns to be a pretty. After her best friend moves to Pretty Town, Tally was left friendless. Really lonely, Tally schemed her largest trick ever, sneaking into a Pretty Town party. She crashes the party, runs aways, and meets Shay, another ugly. The two become best friends. But not everything goes well. Shay disagrees with the city's system so she runs away to the Smoke, a rebellion group that lives in the wild. For years, some uglies have run away to the Smoke to avoid turning pretty. Special Circumstances want to capture the Smoke but they need Tally to follow her enigmatic directions from Shay to the Smoke. Tally is forced to travel to the Smoke on a betrayal mission or stay ugly forever, a difficult choice between friendship or desire.     While reading the book, I realized a very important message: life is more than superficial appearances. Beauty does not fix everything. Even a seemingly perfect world like Pretty Town has its dark secrets. Therefore, one should be true to oneself and not blindly follow everyone else. Especially during the teenage years when our bodies and minds grow, and emotions blossom, we should not hide our individualism because our individual experiences make our lives truly beautiful.
0684830485|5.0|This is another masterly work from Hemingway. When he gets it right, he gets it OH so right. You have more tight, evocative language that conjure up the landscapes the characters live in, and wonderful characterisation so that you fully engage and sympathise with them. This is a great look at the Spanish civil war from the guerrillas point of view, with the assistance of an American explosives expert. It has romance, chivalry, betrayal, adventure and the rougher side of human nature. What more could you want from one novel? If you like Hemingway then this is another great novel and if you're new to him, this may not be the best starting place, but you'll still not be disappointed.<br /><br />Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page.
B001NGWFQ2|5.0|There are no words to describe how much ass these guys kick with three instruments.  Except for one track where Mike Patton guest-screams, (which,as much as I love Patton, on this album is the weakest track); the rest of it is just kicking the living lights out of their instruments, in process creating beautiful, complex, deep, hard, glorious noise.  They were random played on my last fm radio page, and I was instantly hooked. If you like your music on a level that gives your inner organs deep tissue massage, than it doesn't get better than Zu. Great, great work.  I can only imagine how it must be to see them live.  Here's hoping!
B000QEIORG|5.0|This can easily be classed as one of the Foo's best albums and now with the extra tracks this album has just got better! It has some brilliant tracks, 'Monkey Wrench', 'My hero' and the anthem 'Everlong', which are all simply outstanding. The whole album is superb though, very uplifting and just great rock, perfect for those summer days out. This is a great place to start if you're new to the foo's and an excellent addition for any existing foo fans, a must have album!<br /><br />Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page.
B003PIUBZS|5.0|I had no idea what to expect when I watched this and oh my goodness it sucked me in. Wonderful (yet somewhat sad) storyline, beautiful actors, fighting, blood, and sex. There is tons of sex but who is complaining, right? If you have a free weekend, watch it. But, you will need several hours - you won't be able to stop at just one.
B003O5MOES|5.0|This is one of Springsteens best albums. It is in the same vein as 'Nebraska' and has echos of 'Devils and Dust' to come. It is supremely chilled out and very relaxing to listen to, his voice perfectly pitched to tell the stories in each song. This album contains such gems as the title track, 'Youngstown', 'Dry lightning' and 'Best wasn't good enough' to end the album on a perfect note. I tend to feel that the album is best listened to in it's entirety to get the full benefit from it though. This is Springsteen doing what he does best, which is telling a beautiful story, backed by great music, simple as that. Don't buy it expecting the Stadium anthems of the 80's, but do expect some of the best music that Bruce has ever put out.<br /><br />Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page.
B004P9GOAC|4.0|This is a $120 set available directly from Lego and authorised Lego dealers. Don't encourage these thieves who are just trying to exploit ill-informed customers. I am amazed Amazon still allows these crooks to exploit their web-site.     It is easy to cure; make the sellers display the list price and let the customer choose. But the sellers would not agree to this would they. This clearly shows Amazon is only concerned about short term profits and does not care about its customers.
0307387178|5.0|This is another gripping and highly readable book from Jon Krakauer. It looks at the life and travels of Chris McCandless as he gave up his ties to conventional society and sought a life unfettered and based on his love of the wilderness and nature. This book is interspersed with stories of other people who have gone off and sought that closer connection with nature, including one of the authors own. You can't help but admire Chris in this book, but also despair at some of his attitudes and lack of preparation. This has some wonderful quotes to begin each chapter and tells this intriguing story in a way that honours Chris' memory and ideals, whilst being completely absorbing at the same time. Well worth a read.<br /><br />Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page.
