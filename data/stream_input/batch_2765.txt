0425263924|4.0|Love the crossfire series, I really do not mind that 2 other books are coming out.  I feel left hanging? I LOVE Gideon & Eva and loved this story until the last page because it felt like this was is the middle of the story and then BAM it's over...
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is addicting in a good way!<br />The cute little minions plus hard obstacles, what more could you ask for?
B006GLMHBM|5.0|I never understood the rave of Sex in the city so I never got into it, probably.because.I was too busy being a little bit of each character. But a client recommended I watch since I was single still as what not to do and what to look for being I had already been there done that and not to be that anymore. Sooo, I ordered it on here since redbox or netflix didn't have it so here I am a big fan now! Love that I can download the seasons at a time and watch immediately.
B004Q3UL2O|5.0|The film is amazing, and funny. Recommend to everybody. Must see the movie if you're looking for something very funny.
B002ZG99TK|5.0|Since everyone else has already provided their summaries of the storyline, their opinions on the acting and everything else, I will, as I always do, only focus upon the quality of the transfer of this film to Blu Ray for the film 'Unstoppable'.  I'm a big Denzel fan but that's besides the point.<br /><br />VIDEO...The transfer from Standard Def to Blu Ray leaves nothing wanting.  While I do not have the Standard Def version to make any comparisons to, the Blu Ray version really is pristine.  There were no artifacts or aliasing in any part of the film and no noticeable or intrusive film grain.  However, while the directors tried to limit the amount of CGI effects for the train, I could tell when it was used.  Most probably could, especially when the train 777 takes that last and most dangerous curve in Stanton.  Never the less, the colors in this film are very realistic and bright and the contrast is excellent with good detailing in any of the darker areas.  In the beginning, the film appeared to have a somewhat desaturated look, especially when the character played by Chris Pine is introduced to the other track men, including Denzel's character.  After that point, color grading is amped to a very, but not overly warm hue.  Mbps appeared to average in the low to mid thirties.  Video here is really what we hope all Blu Rays will look like.<br /><br />AUDIO...The audio is DTS HD MA 5.1 and the lossless audio always makes a big difference in my book.  Dialogue is always easy to understand and doesn't do battle with the music score or foley effects of which there are many.  While there is a good amount of tracking from the front stage to the rear, you really aren't so much aware of discreet directionality of the audio as you are of the fully encompassing of yourself into both sound stages.  Your LFE channel will be working throughout almost the entire film and while the bottom end doesn't reach to the deepest Hz, it is fully present as a speeding train would demand.<br /><br />EXTRAS...Unfortunately, there are advertisements for the value of a digital copy and two previews of other films.  This makes you having to pay for ads when your money should go to even less compression and an even better transfer to the Blu Ray disc.  Also there is the typical commentaries, a doc on the making of, a feature on a few of the stunts.  There are no extended cuts or deleted scenes which I usually like to see.  The digital copy is a separate disc which is wonderful and easy to install and transfer to your computer and other gizmos.  It's a heck of a lot better than having to deal with UltraViolet and others of that type.<br /><br />All in all, if you do not have this exciting and suspenseful film on Blu Ray, I do recommend that you get it.  The quality of the disc is very good all around and the 5 stars I gave it refer to that quality and not how much I did or did not care for the film.<br /><br />All my reviews focus solely on the quality of the transfers to Blu Ray of both video and audio and I do hope that this review has been of some help to you in deciding upon your purchase decisions and that I am on the correct path with this type of review.<br />Thanks for reading.><br />EXTRAS...Unfortunately, there are advertisements for the value of a digital copy and two previews of other films.

B009XIXVU6|5.0|Like his prior two novels, Hosseini has crafted a beautiful and engaging tale using the backdrop of Afghanistan. Multiple lives diverge and intersect in this powerful story about family and the ties that hold people together.
B00AQ71FLK|4.0|a pretty good moba though I do drop from a lot of matches I'm not sure if that's just my inferior internet.  all things said I like this game
B00BEXB18M|5.0|I love Megadeth and have since High School!  I know a lot of people aren't liking this ine cause it isn't the old Megadeth like &#34;Last Rites,&#34; or &#34;Rattlehead.&#34;  Well it isn't it is new and fresh and doesn't all sound the same like Nickelback.  If you keep making the same stuff over and over again it gets old and starts to sound the same.  It is still Thrash Metal with som e new style and the riffs that Mustaine cranks out are sick!!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is Amazingly fun! Download try it if it's not your cup-o-tea delete and go back to angry birds lol DMMR is the best game!
B001QW8QYS|4.0|This film from the late 40's is as old as dirty as is the true story but it delivers a powerful gut punch to Roman tyranny and gives the viewer an idea of Christian love and faith derived from a relationship with Christ our Lord. There is a bit of fiction in there but none that cannot be overlooked in view of the marvelous results and spectacular splendor of those times when Rome ruled the world. Nero is wonderfully played by Peter Ustinov and Marcus Vanicious is a delight as well is the lovely Lydia. It has an all-star cast and is worth every minute of the three hours you will spend enthralled by it.<br /><br />I have it on DVD and will now add it to my Kindle to watch where and whenever I chose. My favorite actor is Nero (Peter Ustinov). Although his menacing evil is sickening and very real, I think he does the role justice as does his evil queen Popea. She really was his \\"evil genius\\" advising him to kill the Christians in the arena with lions and crucifixion. Horrifying yet magnificently done and TRUE. I recommend this film to anyone who wants a glimpse into those wild days when life wasn't worth a plug nickle to the rulers of the day and how God triumphs in the end as it will be in the days ahead. It's grand and colossal with superb acting by a cast of super stars and over 10,000 extras. Don't miss this one!
B0010SKUYM|4.0|This book was a recommendation of a friend after I read &#34;Song of Ice and Fire&#34;. After my initial surprise that &#34;The Name of the Wind&#34; is actually a great coming of age story with several twists written by a very talented author I was totally enchanted.
B004MC8CA2|4.0|This sounds like a most useful app.  Does anyone know whether it will be coming along for Kindle Touch and iPad?
B005LAIISA|1.0|We love the other three, but this one is bad.  Even my 17th month old watched about 30 minutes, and left to play.  He watches all the others all the way thru. They thru in every cliché and movie reference the cold, it seems more like a desperate gimmick then a movie.  The only one in the family who did like it is our 12 year old, and she watches mainly Disney, so I think she's their target market humor wise with this one.
B009MF56GC|5.0|This film plays out with the perfect mix of violence, one liners and action cliche to make it work. Unusually the second film fixes the bulk of the problems in the first. A great, albeit it dumb film you will love.
B00A6RCSKC|4.0|I love kingdom rush, but only 4 stars because you have to scroll around on screen which is annoying.  Still buy it.
B001GA1RFA|2.0|I have read all of John Green's books and absolutely loved them! Meaning, I had extremely high expectations when reading this book. In general, I just felt bored throughtout the whole book. There was nothing exciting happenning in the plot. Another element that bothered me alot were all the footnotes at the end of each chapter. I heard this is just because of the kindle edition. Nevertheless, it was still annoying. I love John Green, but I would not reccommend this book to others.
B00DURILJ2|5.0|We took a chance and bought this movie because we didn't want to wait to rent it, and it was worth it.  It kept us interested start to finish, a really good movie.<br />We thought the casting was perfect too, good acting from the four main characters.  Couldn't believe this was the first movie for the kid who plays Neckbone,<br />I don't think they could have found a kid that played the role better than he did.<br />Language and Nudity: No nudity or anything gratuitous, just kept it clean and told a story.  Language, profanity throughout the movie.
B00D41AJ7G|5.0|Got this a free app of the day and would willingly pay for it.  It is challenging but not impossible.  I feel very satisfied when I figure out how to paint each ball.  That isn't always the case with puzzle games.
B008602KQI|5.0|Had seen it before, but still enjoyed it again. Watching it again out on the deck on my PC.  I believe I could watch again, its that good.
B00BVYNSLC|5.0|What a great new show . Tatiana Maslany does a fantastic job of playing 6 Characters so differently. It is a shame many people did not see this show when it was on BBC America. This beats the cheap reality junk the networks broadcast!
B004GYY714|5.0|Very happy with it. It's on my Kindle, it's on my Iphone, it's everywhere I go! Great app for 100% ABBA Radio lovers.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I luv this game!it is like subway surfers but better!if you like despicable me and subway surfers you'll love this game!!!:)
B004J4WKUQ|3.0|This was a good bit of fun on a vacation day. The references to all of the 80's stuff was a little over the top, but it was a lighthearted read.
B000MV8DB0|5.0|Excellent vinyl with a fantastic mix of true masters. A compound of senses and sounds that will delight and surprise.
B003YTPS7O|5.0|Loved the movie.  Read the book some years ago and saw the movie when it first came out.  Wanted to watch it again just before renting a wonderful rental chateaux within spitting distance (well, maybe a tad further) of the location where the movie was shot!  Gorgeous Provence, maybe the best part of France!!!
B002TYZKIM|5.0|This is all I expected it to be.  A great documentary and very entertaining.  The music is awesome. I was very please with my purchase.
B006DPXFVM|1.0|So I downloaded this to a TiVo device, and 30 minutes into it, the picture gets corrupted, and the movie freezes. There's no going forward to a clear part. The file is bad and that's that. I think I'll rent from somewhere else, from here on out.
B0099G7KDQ|4.0|I like Mumford & Sons, but I get tired of their songs quickly. There's not a lot of variety in pacing and styling of their songs on this album I feel like and thus I get bored trying to listen to the whole thing.
B009NY43NY|3.0|The series really started slacking off over the last few books, but I was hoping that it would go out with a bang. It didn't. I liked how everything was wrapped up, but a lot of it felt rushed and there were so many typos, grammar errors as well as punctuation mistakes that I was floored! I've seen less mistakes in Indie books! So, overall it was just okay.
B00127RAJY|4.0|I can understand it she's very informative and its helping me to get stronger. I'm able to keep up and the low impact is great
B001QB9H1K|5.0|Liked his Transporter. That was the basis for me to buy this Blu-Ray.<br /><br />Have seen it.<br /><br />If I ain't going to win no Nobel Peace Prize then Snowden and Assange should share that honor in my stead even though I am far more worthy.<br /><br />Politicians all are petty little hypocrites. The pettiest are the Prez's of the USA.
0061950726|5.0|This book was wonderful. My Aunt's Mother was a \\"Orphan Train Rider\\" in the '20's. She and her brothers were sent to Noel, Missouri. Edith, the \\"rider\\" grew up working on a farm there, married and raised her kids there.As an adult, my Aunt traced her mother's family to Pennsylvania and, eventually met some of her relatives.<br /><br />I enjoyed \\"Orphan Train, a Novel\\" very much. The characters were well developed and clung to my heart. I read this book on my Kindle which I purchased from Amazon in 2009. Love it.
B0099Y2MYK|4.0|There is much to recommend about \\"Downton Abbey,\\" especially the sharp dialogue and characters that the actors bring to life.<br /><br />But the ending to Season 3 is not very well thought out.  After the final build-up to the romance of Lady Mary and her cousin at the end of Season 2, this new series fleshes out the complex development of their relationship.  But suddenly after Lady Mary has given birth to her child, there is one short final shot of Matthew Crowley's death in a car accident.<br /><br />I understand that Dan Stevens did not want to continue playing Matthew, so apparently Julian Fellowes decided that, therefore, he had to eliminate the character of Matthew, but given the arc of \\"Downton Abbey,\\" this does not make a lot of sense, at least from the dramatic point of view.  It is a let-down and very contrived.  Surely the producers could have found another gifted actor to play Matthew (with the viewers more than able to accept the change).<br /><br />The romance between Lady Mary and Matthew was one of the most interesting and touching sub-plots, and without it, I think \\"Downton Abbey\\" will lose interest (the sub-plots concerning, respectively, Edith, Robert Crawley and his American wife, Bates and Anna, and the other servants being less dramatically compelling) quickly.  One wonders how Matthew would have continue to work at saving Downton Abbey as the heir and also co-proprietor, and how his relationship with Lady Mary would have developed.<br /><br />Now all this has been  blown to bits, so to speak.<br /><br />(What about a fan campaign to change the ending of Season 3?).
B00CAJMGDI|5.0|I played violin for about 10 years and thus may be a bit more appreciative of her music, but I do love that she's got this new feeling mix of styles in all of her songs. The whole entire album is a pleasure to listen to; lively but also relaxing. So glad I stumbled across her!
B00CO8D3G4|5.0|This should be read by anyone in corporate middle management and below.  It's a much needed dose of reality for anyone who thinks their employer really values them.
B009XIXVU6|3.0|The characters in this book connect with no one including me.  I did not care about any of them, a fundamental requirement for a novel to succeed . After being so taken with Istanbul, this was a great disappointment .
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|i love despicable me minion rush, game is very very good. I can play this game all day. so i love banana and minions
0307476464|5.0|My first impression of the novel is quite positive (as I have read only 30 pages for today.)  Murakami respectively hails as one the best selling-authors in Japan and of the world to say the least.  His novels have been translated to more than forty languages.  Murakami's latest novel, 1Q84, captures a dystopian society in which morals, social and political acuity is at stakes.  It is published in three volumes, or books, and I have to say, it is no ordinary novel as it spans more than 1000 pages; yet, it is captivating and hard to put down at times. Society is in ruin. Anyways, Murakami creates his usual unique characters such as Aomame, which means `Green Peas', who is likely to do the unordinary.  Tengo, the math teacher, aspiring to be a writer and get published, is rather a fun character and relatable.  I, myself, am a person whose dream is to be published one day.  This Tengo has had a harsh memory sticking in his head, and he feels dizzy whenever it comes up. I don't want to spoil much although I am tempted.  Finally, not to forget the last character whom I felt I should've known better as I haven't had the chance in my real life to deal with one like him.  Komatsu, an editor, helps Tengo gets published (that is if I am not mistaken up till now.) This character is likeable and has ways to talk to people.  The ones hating him are more than the ones who like him.  And the ones he hates are more than the ones he likes.  Read the Norwegian Wood and you would also be amazed at how wonderful his characters are \\"alive\\" and \\"believable.\\"<br /><br />Murakami's style reminds me of his novel, Kafka on the Shore, which had been the most bizarre novel that I have ever read in my life, and one of the novels that I didn't quite actually understand.  It didn't prevent me from reading it though.  I feel that 1Q84 would be the same.  The plot could be confusing, but the style is so simple, yet imaginative. The plot involves love, mystery, suspicion, fantasy, sex, and all that is considered to lay society in ruins.  Will I be able to witness one of his characters be able to overcome the lust of ruin? If so, I'd like to see how.  If not, I'd like to see how they fall to such a miserable fate.  Dystopia is a society that is undesirable or frightening, according to Wikipedia.  It is true. In all what I see in his novel such as the traffics, the mesmerizing courage of ordinary people (who are the characters), the memories of a mother having sex with a stranger, and the passing of the Expressway, which is supposed to be used only during emergencies.  Murakami makes good use of descriptive details, which I guarantee that they are not boring whatsoever. You will want more! His world is a living breathing world and is typical of him, Murakami I mean.<br /><br />I encourage all of you who haven't read it to pick it up.  They say it rivals George Orwell's novel, 1984, which I guess the title of Murakami's novel is derived from.  I think the Q might be a homophone in Japanese or some kind of word play.  I will have to search that up. I haven't as well read George Orwell's novel so I guess I am not in a position to make a choice in which novel is better.  I am certain I will read it one day!

B006MW3UZW|5.0|As much as I dislike supporting anything to do with PBS on recommendation of a family member I ordered  Season One.  By the time we made it through disc two I had ordered Season 2.  I can now say we are the proud owners of all three seasons plus the Christmas special.  One of the best things I've watched in many years.  Will admit though to having some trouble with the English accent, but as it goes along I get better at understanding what is being said.
1846866588|5.0|It started when I found their video stories on you tube. My grandson has to watch. He loves the books also. Extra treat the books come with CD.
B008XKSW7M|3.0|Somehow I just couldn't get 'into' this film.  I don't know who cut it together but I have a feeling it could have been done much better.  There were some good dialogue / lines.  And the plot devices really weren't as out there as I initially thought.<br />I especially liked that Dad's new trophy wife had some character to her and wasn't 'one dimensional' as usually portrayed.<br /><br />In the end though it came close to feeling like time lost watching it.
B00DHNAQ2Y|5.0|Although the corky comedy side of the originals and cheesy lines that made them so great like \\"gimme some sugar baby\\"  from Bruce Campbell have been limited or cut out...... for the standards of horror movies these days this is a must watch for any horror buff. Super gory with a twist at the end you can't go wrong. Also, Bruce even helped with this flick so you know it's great!

B000XUBFE2|5.0|Perhaps the most emotional book I have ever read. Forget silly teenage romance. The love and loss here us fierce and real. Told from the point of view of death, the boom gas a new format as far as chapters are concerned but the writing us flawless. Love, hate... loss, death it never changes but fir the time period.

B00DR0PDNE|5.0|This is by far the easiest way to stream to a HDMI TV.  Set up is a breeze.  You can either use your App from the play store or use your google chrome app.  If you have a Belkin router and have problems just change your security settings.  When it streams its clear and sound is great.  Loving it right now.
B000FVE3AC|5.0|SECOND REVIEW:<br /><br />I was so impressed by this watch when I got it in the mail the first time. As you might have read, my brand new watch was broken. I really wanted this watch so I sent it back and ordered it from another company. The original company would not exchange it for a working grand diver.<br />A few days after I placed my order for my second grand diver watch it showed up to  my house. It actually came in a different box that looked pretty sweet. The first thing I did was wind the watch up and guess what, It started working like it is suppose to. I took it to the same jeweler that I took the broken watch the first time and he gave it a once over and said it was working great!<br />I have had the watch now for a couple of weeks and it has become one of my favorites. I also own a Subaqua Noma iii and it is pretty sweet too.<br /><br />FIRST REVIEW:<br />I was so excited for this watch. I spent a lot of time reviewing this particular Invicta Grand Diver. I opened the box and it looked amazing. I started to wind the crown to get this watch started and....nothing. Went to jeweler down the street and he said it wasn't working either. I own a Subaqua Noma iii and love it! I'm just disappointed now. Hopefully there isn't any issue with the return. Not sure if I just got lemon watch. :(

B0013TXA5Y|4.0|City of Bones is a very entertaining read as long as you don't try to expect too much from a series that is pandering to the YA Fantasy audience. I've read other reviews that draw parallels with anything from Buffy to Harry Potter. They want to rehash every single detail of the story that has been done before. It's really not that serious guys... As a longtime fan of both Buffy and Harry Potter, the parallels I found in City of Bones were a much welcomed nostalgia. Was it the best, most original piece of work that I have ever read? No. Still, a lot can and should be said about Cassandra Clare obviously knowing and understanding her audience. Franchises like Buffy, Harry Potter, and Twilight have left a void with the supernatural / fantasy audience and Cassandra Clare fills that void. It's that simple.<br /><br />As much as City of Bones reminds me of other favorites in the genre, it also wades into uncharted territory in many instances. It feels to me that this series leans more towards the adult end of the Young Adult spectrum. It's Harry Potter meets Twilight, with a heart wrenching twist. Not wanting to include any spoilers, I will say that I am anxious to see how the twist plays out as the story goes on. I am also excited about the discovery that a major character just happens to also be gay. The series seems to have a lot of potential for getting that right for once.<br /><br />As this is the first book in the series, a lot of time is spent constructing this new Shadowhunter universe but I believe it is time well spent. Some of the character development has left a little to be desired but that is the great thing about having 5 more books in the series. I didn't expect all of my questions to be answered in the first book and I look forward to learning more about these characters as the series progresses.
B008K6HN8I|5.0|This is an excellent app. I downloaded this to help me put some google applications for my Kindle Fire. I came across it on a video on You tube (to help with a possible chrome installation to support use of a chromecast). I am glad I did. It allows you to do everything with your files. It is just like being on a PC and gives all the tools of a good file management system. It has the ability to compress, unzip, rename, cut, delete move, send to, etc. A very versatile app. Best of all it was free!!! A great free app that runs great on my Kindle Fire.

B0085YOD1A|5.0|I had been looking for a battery usage app for my Kindle Fire for a while to see where and why my battery life seemed a little on the low side. Battery pro shows me exactly where the power is going, and helps me make adjustments to extend my usage. Very good app.
B00C391Y3I|4.0|I'm not a huge Priest fan, but I love blu-ray concerts, so I picked this one up, & on the whole enjoyed it. The loss of one star is for the very fast editing that plagues so many concert videos, but more-so for the use of special effects, which is something I dislike in a video. The effects aren't in every song, but pop up often enough to annoy someone like me who doesn't like them. Still watchable, but let's leave special effects back in the 80's where they belong.
159463176X|4.0|I really wanted to rate this book a 3.5, but that's not an option. I read and loved his prior book and it was a 5. So I went into this one with higher expectations and found myself mildly disappointed. I loved the beginning. I thought it was excellent. But the more characters and locations that were introduced it began to dilute the overall story for me. I also wasn't pleased with the ending (don't want to give it away here). This book could have been 100 pages and several characters less. So while I liked it, I expected it to be better and found me loving the first half of the book and growing tired in the second half.
B00E194KGQ|5.0|This album is easily the next album of the year, its such a musical masterpiece, I can't even describe it. Its a combo of their 3 other albums, and nothing is perfect, then we have to change that. Cause this. This is perfect.
B00BAYLRNO|3.0|This is just another disaster movie in the same genre as The Towering Inferno and the Airplane movies. The general theme is to quickly get the viewer to identify with a group of people who will suddenly become embroiled in the epicenter of some unexpected disaster.  The movie unfolds in the events to save people while using special effects to give the viewer the experience of actually being in the disaster. This is  not a bad movie, it is just predictable.
B00CWY76CC|3.0|can you sind me some more game thank you so.<br /><br /> plesas send me some more free game ok me and my wife played the game dam near all nigth long.
B008HK3XU4|5.0|I love it.  It is exactly what I expected and cannot say anything bad about it.  Great value for the price.
B00006G8G1|4.0|This DVD is not without it's flaws, the worst being the packaging. The cheap foam inserts holding the discs in place both came off during shipping resulting in heavy scuffing on both discs.Cheap,cheap,cheap! Luckily my player was able to view them with only a couple of brief hiccups. The audio/video quality is good, but not great. I've heard better audio mixes & watching 4:3 aspect ratio nowadays makes the video seem dated(shouldn't we have had 16:9 seeing as this show is 2001?). Of course the editing could be slowed down a lot, but it's not the worst I've seen.And the bonus disc is nothing to get excited about.<br />  The 4 stars are earned by my favorite Maiden line-up, playing at their best, in front of a massive ,loving crowd. It's an event well worth watching.
B009WUAK2M|5.0|Even better then 1, this was my third time watching it, but Arnold performance was very tacky in this movie,
B0051DSAP8|5.0|Gonna make this short and sweet. Mix Alestorm with some harpsichord, Gregorian monks, and a theme of werewolves and the papacy, then take away all pirate elements - then you have Powerwolf. This is my first CD buy from these guys, and I have to say, this one is a lot of fun. Gotta give credit to the lead singer to set them apart from other power metal acts - he switches from metal to monk chant on a dime. Impressive. For fans of Gloryhammer and other power metal bands that don't take themselves too seriously. Epic good time. Buy this!
0399159347|5.0|First let me say that I am vague in this review because I don't want to reveal any of the secrets that make this such a good read! I started this book at 4PM and finished it at 6:30 PM.  I could not stop reading this book! Liane Moriarty has written a story of the long ramifications of split second decisions people make when in the grasp of emotion. What was absolutely riveting to me was how the woman in this book handled the discovery of secrets in all of their lives.  Cecilia has the hardest job of the three because her husband's secret is seemingly unforgivable.  Tess learns that her husband has fallen in love with her cousin and best friend, takes off for her mother's and has an affair with an old flame.  Rachel has never gotten over her daughter's murder and has focused her hatred on a young man who she has always believed to be the guilty party.  The three women intersect through the local Catholic school that Tess and Cecelia's children attend and where Rachel works. Connor the old flame and also the object of Rachel's suspicions works at the school as the PE teacher.<br />I could not imagine how the writer would come to any kind of acceptable resolution in this book but she does. The book is a testament to the things people will endure for their children and how they are willing to act in ways they would have once thought unimaginable. Cecilia  must decide to go on living with the discovered secret or break up her family.  Tess has to take a look at how her past and present actions have contributed to her marriage breaking up and to the chances of any future reconciliation. Her relationship with Connor is going to lead to heartbreak no matter how it unfolds.  Rachel makes a terrible decision that causes irreparable harm to one person but paves the way for a measure of forgiveness for another.<br />The epilogue is like a final little knife in the heart with some of the \\"if this had happened\\" speculation it imparts. It reminds of a popular commercial where the first person did a nice thing and the second person was watching, so they did a nice thing and so on until the circle returns to the first person.  So much heartache could have been avoided if only the first thing in this book would have been an act of kindness not  malice.first person did a nice thing and the second person was watching, so they did a nice thing and so on until the circle returns to the first person.

B001NLKZUA|5.0|Pretty happy with all the extras I'm hopping that had and clary are not going to brother and sister I want them to be together everyone does and the inquisitors was going to say something but died shortly after I need to know what going on I want to know! But everything was amazing I loved it I gotta read the next one!
B00D2K40WY|5.0|I love this game!!! It is fun playing because you don't just do the clothes and make-up. You can get rid of the pimples, wash the face and do the hair to. But I recommend getting the full version because then nothing is locked.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is the best no lie... but it's really despicable that I have to wait for it to update...
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I absolutely plover the first movie and cant wait for the second one, bit I LOVE THIS GAME!!! THE BEST PART OF ALL IS YOUR A MINION!! SWEET!! you also get to beat vector and all the other baddies out there!!  sweet movie, awesome game!!
B001BKVWYG|5.0|This is very worth listening to. Watched the documentary &#34;Searching for Sugar Man&#34; and had to own the music, Great stuff
B0064X7FVE|2.0|I really liked this until they changed about a month ago. It seems now more difficult to navigate and difficult to see your favorite locations...I have kids in three cities. Go back PLEASE.
B006M4F67A|5.0|I really enjoyed this book.  I loved the characters and this interactions.  It was well written. Especially Euan, he was strong and awesomely HOT!!!  I 're liked at the end how the guy Raven turned out to be...don't want to g it as  but I just new that was who he would be.
B008JFUR10|5.0|This is a little Godzilla, a little Independence Day, a little Starship Troopers (the original), a little Transformers, a lot of Kick Ass!<br /><br />I'm not sure what people are complaining about, you knew it was a monster/robot movie, you knew it was an action film...what were you looking for...deeper meaning, really?  People are saying it has no plot, wonder what they have to say about Die Hard, Transformers or the like.  This has a plot, get rid of the monsters and not die.<br /><br />This is an action packed, go go go, type movie.  there are characters you really connect with, funny off the wall people who you laugh at, lots of action sequences, and even a part that if you are a parent will bring you to tears thinking of your child in their place.<br /><br />I really liked it...did it have times that I thought of another movie in this one...yes, see first line.  The only thing that I thought was goofy, was the \\"speech\\", too reminiscent of Independence Day, which their speech was way better.<br /><br />All in all a good Action Monster vs. Robot for the fate of Humanity movie.
B00594XOZU|4.0|On other devices Kik has been updated &amp; it is so much better !!!!! Please update this app asap !!!!!!!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|If I could I'd give this game 5 stars like 5 times!!! Addictive ...yeah i think so =) Such an awesome game!!
B00C1BU8G2|5.0|love the effects  again  very entertaining  keeps you on your toes  another good one for  the family to watch is you love  special action adventure effects
B00008J2PG|5.0|Wonderful ending where the priest shows his Christian spirit by his loving actions to someone who made his life and many others very difficult.
B0094M2GNE|5.0|Something in the way of &#34;Super 8&#34;, but much more violent, raw, and with language laced with many &#34;F&#34; words.  And it's British, so most of us Americans will need subtitles to understand the colorful, oftentimes funny dialogue.  There are some scenes involving a marijuana growing room.  So, not for kids.<br />In my opinion, it's a must see for any adult or older teen fan of sci fi.
B00DJFIMW6|1.0|Not very good quality. Starts to load then freezes, forcing me to reboot my tablet. PLEASE fix this, so no one else has this problem!
B00BUAEYVK|4.0|It was far fetched but it was an adventure as one expects from a professional like Bruce Willis, he never sat still, great move.

B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|i looked into many mouses and this one wins by far. no doubt about it. way better than the razer products
B00DEG4Z1W|3.0|I wasn't that impressed with the game... it was very cool looking at first and I thought it might be a fun game... boy was I wrong! it is very confusing and does not have very impressing control for the User... save ur time and don't get this app.
B005LAII44|3.0|I'd give this movie 3 1/2 stars. It was a decent movie but I was pissed in the first 15 minutes and that ruined the rest for me. I'll watch it again, I'm sure. I'm just very disappointed with who wrote the movie. Have they never read a comic book or watched the cartoon?
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Love this game I love the minions they are so cute and super awesome this is better than the other running games
0770435726|4.0|I found the jumping back and forward in the story annoying and only marginally increasing the tension.  It kept my attention regardless.

B000T433CO|5.0|It was funny from beginning to end.  The actors were at their best.  Eli Wallach was a delightful surprise.  It's  fantastic how some of our best actors are aging so well and still have top notch performances.  Two very different women trading homes for the holidays to very different homes sounded like something I would like to do.  And to add to that both finding love in a funny and touching way.  Cameron Diaz' character was great in her straight forwardness.  Imagine meeting a man, kissing him ( or rather him kissing you right away) and then finding yourself saying &#34; Do you want to have sex?&#34;  Then Iris ( Kate Winslet) and Miles ( Jack Black) finding they have both come out of the same kind of bad relationship where they both seemed to be a the mercy or whim of their former loves.  Then turn the tables on them and turn to each other.  More comedy than romance but a good mix for me.  I think the guys would enjoy this one.  As far as Jude Law as Graham, Iris's brother, he was charming, witty and of course very handsome.  But I don't need to tell the ladies that. I highly recommend it if you are in the mood for a movie that takes you along with it without making you think about the plot or outcome.  It just flows naturally.  Try it, you'll like it.
B00DGNO3WE|5.0|The movie, Quartet, is a wonderful look at aging and moving past an identity defined by giftings. It is poignant to see such brilliant musicians still enjoying 'making music together' in spite of not being their long ago very best. The movie subtly declares that we are more than our abilities, our looks, our economic status, or heritage. To love and be loved for just 'being' is the depth of life and purpose.
B00DNO3JUI|5.0|A film of circumstance and deeply held passions. A passion for music and her piano is what keeps a mute woman sane and music is how she expresses herself. The story is also about passion between man and woman and love that becomes overwhelming and all consuming. Jane Campion wrote, ( Academy Award for Best Screenplay), and directed, (nominated for Best Director), this fine film which was nominated for Best Picture. Holly Hunter gives a moving, Academy Award winning Best Actress performance as Ada, the mute pianist whose father has arranged for her to marry a man from the remote New Zealand wilderness that she has never met. Sam Neill plays the man who is to be her new husband. Harvey Keitel is the neighbor who becomes obsessed with Ada and the very young Anna Paquin, (Best Supporting Actress), plays Ada's daughter. The outstanding performances are what make this movie. I imagine with another cast this could have been a dud. Holly Hunter conveys every emotion and angst without saying a word. Anna Paquin was simply amazing, her performance was flawless. Harvey Keitel did a spot on Scottish accent with a strong, passionate performance. The synopsis states that the husband is callous, I disagree. He cares for Ada and wants them to have a loving relationship, but he doesn't know how to achieve that. He is intimidated by her muteness and yet can't express his own feelings in words or actions. Sam Neill gives a strong performance as the suffering husband. The stunning cinematography completes the package for this truly amazing film. One more comment, the movie is rated R for \\"moments of extremely graphic sexuality.\\" This is not true, \\"extremely graphic sexuality\\" makes it sound like a porno which this movie certainly is not! There is nudity, but there isn't any graphic anything. Graphic is a word that should be used with violence not with two people expressing emotions for one another.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Really fun and a whole probably one of the most funnest games ever but I need 9999999999 coins please from the people who made it cause I play this every day

1401225756|4.0|Haunting and bleak, this is a collection of the first issues of the Gaiman Sandman series.  A fantastical romp through the world of the god of dreams, the stories that are contained within this slim graphic volume are a terrifying jaunt along with the freed prisoner as he tries to collect his three tools that he needs to-  Well, I am not sure why he needs them, yet.  But the stories within are mature, striking, and a visual and prose masterpiece that has surprising weight and maturity in the graphic novel genre.  What I think is the best of this is that it showcases Gaiman's mastery over storytelling and the English language, as well as a surprising collection of artwork that was provided by three different artists who embody a striking vision of the 1990s in the use of mixed media in presenting the story.  These books were published in 1988, and while some of the imagery in this is now cliche, the postmodern approach and transmission of these images that were close to a decade before their time was simply amazing.  While these are great pieces, I have also read Signal To Noise and I was almost turned off by the cliche aspects of the edgy art contained therein - but I can only imagine what I would have thought about Sandman if I chose to buy these rather than some of the other books I chose to bought at the same time period as a child.  My favorite of the pieces was the horrific and disorienting \\"24 Hours,\\" which engaged my interest and enjoyment the most out of all of the pieces.  It is a masterpiece of bizarro horror and deconstruction of the human spirit in all of its faults.  I look forward to continuing the series, and I look forward to reading more of Gaiman's words as they embody this medium in some of the best ways I have ever seen.  I was first introduced to his work as a prose writer, but these books were a pleasure to read, and the artwork and the Robert Smith-like interpretation of our protagonist is simply intoxicating.  These made me nostalgic for my youth in a lot of ways - a portion of the culture of my time that I never knew existed.outh in a lot of ways - a portion of the culture of my time that I never knew existed.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Surprisingly great game. Had to use problem solving skills. Wish there were more levels. Looking forward to added levels and other games!
1400069807|5.0|This book is a valuable contribution to the expanding literature encouraging consumers to convert from unconscious (hedonistic) eaters to conscious ones.<br /><br />How many of these books will make their way into the hands of those people particularly susceptible to junk-food industry marketing? If the answer is 'very few', then this book is primarily preaching to the choir. I suppose that this is better than not preaching at all.
B009XIXVU6|4.0|I love Hosseini's books. I would give this a 4.5 just because it's not my favorite of the three but it's still a great book in true Hosseini style.
B00D41AJ7G|4.0|This is a good game, but it won't take long till I get to the end of the levels.  Quite a thought-provoking little game!
B0029LCJJS|5.0|I loved it! Could wait to watch the next episode. Wish they would have continued the series with the daughters rule.
B009DCOU9S|4.0|downloaded as faotd...so far I've completed 3 levels and I am enjoying the game...very nice graphics...good zoom...only downside is that its very wordy but you do have option to turn off dialogue
B002QRWJA4|5.0|I love the story and I do love the movie, mostly because I love Gerard Butler as the Phantom!  And Emily Rossum is beautiful and has a lovely voice.  Minnie Driver is fun and I like her voice too!  I am easy to please when it comes to movies but I think the cast was well chosen in this one and feel that they all do a very good job with their performances.  And for anyone who can't physically attend the theater or perhaps can't afford it, this is a wonderful and entertaining rendition of this enthralling story!
B00C7TAF3Y|4.0|Enjoyed it And would recommend. I admit i used the clues alot so glad they were there so i wouldnt get too frustrated<br /><br />.
B008220BP2|5.0|Nicholas Hoult and Teresa Palmer do a great job in this surprisingly good movie, which puts a twist on the zombie genre.  Hoult brings life to his undead character, and Palmer's developing affinity for R is very believable.  Supporting cast is also great.  One of my favorite rom-coms (or zom-coms).  Maybe not quite as good as &#34;Shaun of the Dead,&#34; but this comes from a different angle.  I loved this movie.
B00BM1AJIO|2.0|Why does the original Lost souls, enchanted canvas STILL show up on my device and is playable just fine?  When I purchased the FULLversion, (just recently)  I was under the impression that THE FULL version was MORE GAME PLAY?  It's not!!  In the reviews I read where it was so much better on the HD . I'm on my HD.  Also still have my 2nd generation Kindle Fire.  Both apps play just fine on both devices!!!  For the first time ever, I'm not giving a5 star review for a big fish game.  $4'99 + tax is what this mistake costed me.  Not that it'll matter, but I'm so disappointed.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Graphics are really good and it's fun to play but I don't like how long I have to wait for some tasks to be completed.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|There's a reason this game is so popular. It's easy to get started and has a fairly low learning curve, although it could benefit from a more thorough tutorial; I did find myself looking up rules and explanations online.<br /><br />It has a low frustration profile. If you're struggling to advance, there are always other objectives and daily and weekly challenges that you can focus on to change up the game.<br /><br />It's simple without being repetitive. For example, I used to hate repeating an entire level in Super Mario over and over and over just because I couldn't master one part at the end. In this game, the scenery is repetitive, but it's never in the same order ever, so you never know what's coming next; no matter how far you advanced in the last game, your next temple run will be different from the last.<br /><br />There are very few gamed that I enjoy playing for more than a few days. There are others that are overly obsessive or require too much time to master or advance. This game has a great pace that both gamers and non-gamers alike can enjoy.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|The real benefit of reading through the Kindle app as opposed to some alternatives is that the checkout process is lightning-fast. You can also frequently get free books for Kindle, so not only am I able to read more conveniently, but more cheaply, too!
B002ZG98J6|2.0|I haven't read any of the books, so my reaction to this movie (and anything I say about it) is based purely off what was on the screen.<br /><br />I mention that because my immediate reaction to Percy Jackson & the Olympians - The Lightning Thief was that it desperately wanted to be Harry Potter. Everything that happened in the first 45 minutes just felt like Harry Potter with a slight twist.<br /><br />It's not that the Harry Potter concept was  particularly original but this movie hits so many of the same elements in a similar order that it's really hard to put the comparison's aside. Particularly when you're dealing with the same director who did the first two Potter movies.<br /><br />Unfortunately for most of those elements it's weaker than the movies it gets compared against. Yes it's an American setting and it attempts a slightly edgier tone, but that falls flat given the for kids nature of the movie.<br /><br />The plot itself is blandly inoffensive, the characters and actors are fine. The special effects are adequate or better and they've managed to get a few big names in supporting roles.<br /><br />But none of that leaves a lasting impression. I can't point to anything I hated, but equally I can't point to anything that really stood out.

B00BMUVW5O|5.0|This is the story of two lost kindred souls who find each other one day and nurture each other back to health.  It gives a true portrait of life on the streets and of the effects of becoming invisible.
B005LAIHXQ|1.0|I practically started snoring while watching this movie! It is just beyond me why everyone thinks it is so great? I am a big Sci-Fi and Fantasy genre lover, so it's not that I was out of my element. I just genuinely thought this movie was an over-hyped mess. You can barely see anything on the screen through the whole movie, for one thing. (It's one of those awful films where everything on the screen is incredibly dark). I thought Charlize Theron's character was just uninteresting, as well as most of the other characters. I couldn't find anything to get excited about or be invested in, so I hung on through about 75% of the film, and then just couldn't take it anymore! Fade to black....

B007R4WENS|3.0|I have a tablet that wasn't serving much purpose since I got a netbook (which for my needs is better suited).  I loaded this on my tablet and now it sits on my piano. I haven't played in years and wanted a program that would show me the hand positions for more complicated chords.  While this is okay, the interface is a little confusing and I've been using computers, tablets and smart phones for a LONG time.<br /><br />It is a little slow but the &#34;okay&#34; rating is because there were a few chord combinations that just don't seem to be in there.  And since I just started playing the piano again after several years I hoped this would get me back up to speed quicker.  Oh well, there's always more apps. to try.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Lots and lots of family fun! We all take turns playing and accumulating coins and bananas. Very kid friendly :)

0446555002|3.0|I won't describe the plot, especially since there are at least three going on during the book.  This book is fairly disjointed and basically fills the need of getting  people their Pendergast fix.  It's sad to say, that the book is fairly unremarkable.  Certainly the writing is well done and well controlled, however the series seems  to have lost some of its allure for me.  If you've never read a Pendergast book, then consult Wikipedia and find the order of the first several.  They're definitely worth reading.  However, the later part of the series (say after the first six or seven books) has settled perhaps too comfortably into the nature of a serial, with the episodes  running together in my mind and becoming relatively indistinguishable.
B009NY43NY|5.0|Magnificent! I have been waiting for this book since the first. I can not wait to see what happens next.
B004EPYZP8|5.0|When I read the Lincoln Lawyer, I was impressed with the plot, the characters, and the fact that I had to work to figure out &#34;who done it.&#34;  This film does a good job of giving you the flavor and thrill of the book, without too much compromise on plot.  I know that honing a book and its story down to 2 hours, more or less, is daunting, but this is one of the better attempts.  McConaughey makes a better than passible Mickey Haller and Ryan Phillippe is very well cast as his dubious client.  This is one to see.
B00CKOYVG8|5.0|My husband and I compete with each other every day. He plays on his Kindel fire HD and I on my Droid. We love it.
B007VUCAVO|5.0|Great app. Works as advertised.  I always know exactly how my battery is doing. I Would recommend this to anyone.
B005GSZZ1A|5.0|I could not put down Escape from Camp 14. Even after being stationed in South Korea for several  years, I never really knew what NK was really like. This book does a super job painting the picture. Something must be done in regards to the treatment of prisoners and others in North Korea.
0307951154|4.0|Plot: Having his almost step-son arrested for murder brings Harry Hole back from the far east to track down the real killer and put a drug lord/drug ring out of business.<br /><br />Tons of plot twists, almost like a shell game, yet very low on technology.  Most of the deductions are common sense if you're paying attention and keeping track of clues.  I'm neither a fan of the heavy detective novel (which this is), or stream of consciousness writing (part of which this is).  But Nesbo makes this work.  It's my first Nesbo novel and I was relatively  pleased.  Negative comments might be that its a bit dark and brooding, but that's down to personal taste.  I'm not a big fan of anti-hero books and I would qualify Harry Hole as one of those. Having said that, I'm not opposed to doing Nesbo sometime again in the future.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|I loved both of Hosseini's first two books and this one was just as wonderful. I loved getting to know the characters and found myself longing for even more. Very well written, it will tug on your heartstrings and bring a tear to your eye.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I don't usually keep apps long because I get bored with them. This is not one of those apps. So much fun and great replay value.
B008KYOCA2|5.0|Liked this calendar as it is simple and easy to use. Very handy to have on a KindleFire and easy to look at a glance for upcoming appointments.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|The kids really love this game.  A lot like subway surfer, but they like the characters from the movie, and the extra powers they have
B005544TRQ|5.0|Way better than\\" Mad Men\\". This show has everything good, new and old. Great cinematography and the acting is spot on and a joy to witness. This coming from a successful actor. Only just began watching. On episode 6 of season one and I'm sold.
141659521X|3.0|This is a bit better written than some of Flynn's books of late, but I wasn't convinced to bump it up to 4 stars.  With any Mitch Rapp book, you are going to get 1) a terrorist  2) interfering politician(s) 3) Not much romance (if any)  4) a significant number of dead bodies (mostly bad guys, but not all).<br /><br />Flynn writes in a manner that is a cut above the average for the terrorist genre and I find his plot layouts generally credible and feasible.  He typically doesn't gloss too many details.  I did find one exception here, where Flynn hand-waved on encryption calling it \\"really high grade stuff\\" several times in about a page.  It doesn't take that much time to look up eltiptical curve crytography and 128 or 256 bit keys...one google and a glance at Wikipedia WILL do it.  In short, Flynn isn't subject to gross negligence or errors.  If you're looking for a terrorist/spy genre novel, Flynn is one of the first I'd recommend.  Make sure  you consult Wikipedia and get his books in order, because there is a small but long story arc that should be followed.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|Really fun game. I find myself playing after work quite often. super addictive. I would try it out if you haven't already.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Very captivating... I love all the books, this is my personal fav as the 3rd gets a bit dark. Loved it
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|The unfortunate thing about this device is that you have sellers who have bought up large supplies of these units to try and turn around and sell them at an outrageous mark-up.  Buying a product for $100.00 or more that retails at $35.00 is not only foolish, it lacks any common sense.<br /><br />In two or three weeks, Google will either replenish the supply to legitimate retailers or something else will have come along and the public will have lost interest in this device.  If you pay this kind of mark-up for this device, you may pay out money for something that you might not receive or what you will receive may be damaged.  If the latter is the case, you will be stuck with something that you can't use and the seller either can't or won't replace the device and they most probably won't refund your money.<br /><br />I would advise anyone considering buying from one of the sellers on here to really think about it before putting your money down.  Retailers such as Amazon or Best Buy will more likely honor their return policy and make good on damaged or defective items than most of the rip off artists who bought up these devices just to mark them up in an effort to rip off consumers.

0316228583|5.0|I have not read any reviews of this book and will not read any until I finish my own review. I also did not read a description of the book either, I wanted to leave myself without preconceptions, and let Rowling stand on her own two feet and be able to give an honest review without bias.<br /><br />First, this is definitely not Harry Potter, this is literature, or a reasonable facsimile there of. This novel is less accessible to American readers partially because of its intricacy with the details of how a small British town/village works, as well as many other smatterings of how the British social system works.<br /><br />To pick up on everything, I think you would need to be slightly familiar with the NHS (National Healthcare System), shopping on the high street, the British proclivity for petty theft, the structure of small British villages, the bus system, British lack of talent at cooking, stratification of the social structure, the charging for local calls by the minute when you're on the internet (they're still doing that?),...and on and on. There are literally dozens of things that happen in the novel that would go unnoticed by an American or not translate well.<br /><br />One might complain about the vulgar language in the book. I remember when I first dealt with the Brits in Saudi Arabia and discovered that they had one more article in the English language than we had: a, an, the, (Amazon flagged the F-Bomb...even with *'s).  Sadly, I can vouch that the \\"grammar\\" and \\"vocabulary\\" in this book is correct with the respect to the lower class Brits (and even some middle class).<br /><br />Given she was a single mum (mom for us Americans) and on the dole while she was writing Harry Potter, I wonder if we're seeing part of her view on the public dole and a lot of the people on the dole (i.e. the dole should be a helping hand, and not a support system for habitual druggies).<br /><br />I also noted a lot of references to the classed society of the Brits which doesn't translate all that well to Americans, maybe more so if you come from the east coast rather than the west as I do.<br /><br />There are some sections with so much beautiful irony its amazing.<br /><br />Much of this is narrative, but Rowling uses it effectively, and I don't feel too separated from what's going on. Her characters and their interactions are fairly engaging, and I did't have a problem getting involved with the characters. However, the characters may drive many people wild. They're pathetic, every last one of them, and clearly designed that way on purpose. There's not a single character that you would want to cheer for, except maybe the dead man.<br /><br />Where we were used to defined good and evil in Harry Potter, very few characters can be labeled as evil or nearly evil in this book. Less evolved and crass is a better description, or maybe \\"wuss\\" and \\"not a wuss\\".<br /><br />There's definitely a shotgun blast of subtexts going on about the British system: The Dole, British dentistry, lower class Brits, middle class Brits, people who disregard their doctors advice, addicts, British social stratification, obnoxious teenage boys, trashy teenage girls, there's something for everyone here to needle, pick at, and take the mickey out of.<br /><br />If you want a happy tale, this ain't it.... but if you want an engaging tale about the underside of a small British village where the plot doesn't become clear until nearly the very end, than this is an excellent tale. Set aside your notions of Harry Potter and let Rowling be a whole different author, and this book will not disappoint.n't translate all that well to Americans, maybe more so if you come from the east coast rather than the west as I do.<br /><br />There are some sections with so much beautiful irony its amazing.<br /><br />Much of this is narrative, but Rowling uses it effectively, and I don't feel too separated from what's going on.

B00BP4Z8XY|5.0|This is a fun movie to watch. The animation is excellent and the characters are a fun bunch. There's even some nostalgia for us older folks. I can highly recommend it!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love it! There are only a few things that I would change, but I'm a nit-picky person, and they are minor, random things.
B00CZAYNOC|4.0|The guitars are insane, the drums are never ending, but the vocals could have been better. Not Ivan's best; lyrics are too simple/ bland making them sound cheesy. Also, I'm torn on the remixes. I'm glad they collaborated but maybe they should have only released one version of the song. All in all, a decent album that blends into their previous albums. Cannot wait to see the route they take on volume 2.
B00C1BU7V8|3.0|Lincoln was interesting but not exciting. Too heavy on dialogue and light on action. Great information and look at what took place. Very much like a documentary.
B004A8ZWSS|5.0|Good storyline, My warped sense of humour found it really funny when I saw it on TV. I just had to have it in my film collection...
B0064X7FVE|4.0|US it everyday serves my needs, like the store warning. Check it a lot in bad weather. US on all my devices.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|5 stars are not enough - but that's all there were.  I'd rate it a 10 in a heart beat.
B00DUIBZSK|4.0|Since she is such of young artist ... I don't think I can be so critical ... I think the whole album is fun ... She is doing well with her videos from it ... I like it ... This is my first album that I bought from her ... Recommended B +
B00488SU02|1.0|It is not at all a good movie, better don't waste your time.. would have watched some other better movie..
B00632HWOG|3.0|Wish you would have had directions on how to use the app for this old man. My 2 y/o son was sending email left and right and I couldn't log out.
B007ZXK08C|5.0|What a messed up book but an absolute page turner with twists and turns all the way through. Nicely written
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|I love playing this game very easy and fast. Very entertaining and addicting. You will really like it. My seven year old loves it too.
B006M4F67A|4.0|Challenging and easy to use tiles. Easy on the eyes. tile size is good and the games have different levels.
B005K17RU0|5.0|Just what you need before you go outside!!!!  Spot on for your local or destination travel weather. A great deal for free.
B009NG1Q96|5.0|I loved this book so much and can't wait for the final book to come out.<br /><br />Plus, I am like in love with Maxon; he is just so sweet in the book. And I am curious about the rebels.
B00C7JG0KG|5.0|It's a great movie to watch with the kids. My daughter gets a little scared when she turns into the green witch but we've already watched this like 10 times!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love it  it's awesome it's cool and people who likes Despiable Me movies should get.the game and it is like temple run
B00BOUL9DM|5.0|This game is so fun and I just started this game everyone should get it for their children to learn and solve
B003Q6D2B4|3.0|Actually, I thought I ordered Red 2 bluray instead of Red DVD.  Passed it to a son and will reorder Red 2 BluRay to have both Red and Red 2 in BluRay.
B006VFLIYK|5.0|David Balducci continues to delliver action and espionage sdveture that keeps you enthralled. There are many twists<br />to Will Robies character.
B0055SWM08|5.0|I love this game it keeps u entertained for hours. It really gets your gears turning !!  Please make more versions .
B0032FPVKE|4.0|This is a perfect camera bag for carrying around my Panasonic G5, kit lens, usb cable, camera strap and the charger. The camera with the lens snugly fits inside the main compartment. I chose to keep the charger in the main compartment on the camera as the smaller side compartments aren't big enough and the front compartment will just fit the charger but the bag will look like its protruding in the front.<br />The quality seems very good. I'd say this is very good and compact bag for the mirrorless cameras. Additional lens will not fit. My panasonic G5 is a pretty big mirrorless camera and probably the biggest out there as far as I've seen. So it should fit any mirrorless camera with kit lens and the charger within the main compartment.<br />I still have space in one side and front zippered compartment and probably can fit a white balance card, 1-2 memory cards, another cable like an HDMI cable, and 1-2 usb pen drives as well.<br />For 10$, this is definitely worth it.<br />I gave 4 stars because I would've liked the bag to be just a tiny bit bigger. Nothing wrong with the bag itself.
140006922X|1.0|It't total nonsense and a waste of money and reading time....don't waste either of these yourself....unless you're short of toilet paper.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|Loved the game, wish it was longer.  Graphics where awesome,  just not challenging enough for me, would love more games like this one.
B002ZFQD0E|5.0|Most of pop music today has no meaning, isn't creative, and most of the &#34;artists&#34; who's names get legally glued to their singles that turn into terrible albums and live performances, have no talent. Finally we have a savior. Beautiful blends of modern hip-hop, neo-soul and psychedelia. If you want to spend your money on any album, it should be this one.
B005LAIIJY|1.0|Stupid<br />Even DiCaprio could not save this stinker !!<br />Slow and too long and very, very predictable<br />Don't waist your money !!!!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|love it and so does my son. we cant get enought of it. wish there was a game for the first movie
B00AKEMHCA|5.0|I have it on ninjas kiwi AND the deluxe version. I thought btd4was fun but btd5 is epic they should add co op next
B004EPYZSK|4.0|Part shoot'em up, part wonderfully wicked alien invasion, and all the CGI powers Hollywood has in its mighty arsenal, make this bad boy work.<br /><br />You like cowboys, Indians, aliens, this is your one stop shop. Fast, brutal, at times fun, always larger-than-life.<br /><br />If the title appeals to you, so will the movie.<br /><br />Enjoy!
B008CLI4N4|5.0|If your a GOT fan, then this will not disappoint !!!! Highly recommend!!!!!! Already ordered the second season and can't wait to watch it!!!
B004TI1WME|5.0|Very good calculator, tons of options and buttons.  Works very fast and well.  Its also much easier in that you can see your calculations on a list like when you use and accounting machine.  I think that is the main feature making this app distinct from others.
B0053KWDES|4.0|I ordered the fiio e11 to use with my sony xb600s and an ipod nano. it certainly gives more power for bass..<br /><br />I only wish it would be build a little sturdier but its worth the price. and I was hoping for a more customizable setting rather than only a bass boost EQ and high/low...<br /><br />otherwise good product<br />Edit: be careful which seller you choose, I don't know why but I didn't receive mine, good thing I found this amp at a local audio shop, amazon gave me a full refund
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I want more!  These characters are like family to me!<br /><br />Such a quality series & thanks for showing it on Amazon.
B004LWZW4M|4.0|Thrills, quiet moments, awesome visuals.<br /><br />I think if you like other Planet of the Apes (POTA) movies, just a little, you'll like this movie too.<br /><br />I loved the CGI--absolutely (bad word) amazing. Watching the apes glide along in the trees was truly phenomenal--awe inspiring.<br /><br />Like all POTA movies, just go into it with an open mind and let the magic of the apes whisk you away.<br /><br />If you think too much, you will slip on this movie's sizeable banana peel, and you will wind up feeling like a caged monkey and not one of the apes soaring in the trees.<br /><br />Enjoy!
B000W74EQC|5.0|If you're an adult looking for another way to enjoy this movie, find and mp3 of Wizard People, Dear Reader, download it, and play it while watching this movie on mute. It is HILARIOUS. It's a full-length narration, similar to RiffTrax. You can find the mp3s online. It's got some adult language, but it totally extends the life of the movie.<br /><br />Yes, he does it in a weird voice. But it is so funny you'll get past the voice quickly and your face will HURT with laughter.
B000VZYBZ4|5.0|Usually I only end up liking a few songs on an album but I think I really like 90% of all the songs on this record.  Very funky, cool, and jazzy.  The songs seem pretty timeless and are fun to listen to but also have deeply moving lyrics in some songs if you really listen.  I would consider this an essential album for any music collection.
B0094K1WZE|2.0|The movie was kind of a let down. The story line  was predictable.  The ending was good, clearly with hopes of a sequel.
B0099RFVXQ|5.0|Did not know what to expect but loved it.  Great performances.  a must see for sci fans at any age
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is great when you are looking for a good. It is also good for killing time and its fun to play.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|I loved the movie, but it runs a little long to fit into watching it on a regular basis, I enjoyed it though
B007R4WENS|5.0|This is one of my favorite apps.  I use it all the time while composing and teaching piano.  It satisfies so many needs.
B001ANYDAO|5.0|A friend of mine recommended this book to me.  Very interesting, eye opening in many ways.  Great book to read in your spare time.
B000SEGSB8|5.0|This much lamented historian has a panoramic and insightful vision of where Europe has come from and is now heading
B00AE9UYJ4|5.0|Love the game very fun thrilling and scary my only complaint are some of the glitches sometimes I would fall through the map and I wish there were more levels but get ready to be afraid be very afraid.
B007Q0OUKS|5.0|Gave this to our nephew who loved it. Could not wait to put together with his friend. Great gift for a Lord of the Rings fan.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|It's addictive but would have given it 5 stars if it was easier to get gru coins.<br />My kids want all the characters, but I'm not spending real money on a free game.
B008Y7N7JW|3.0|It was a fun and adventurous movie, but I . Didn't feel like it lived up to the hype.  Good for teens.
B003ZITSI4|3.0|This is an excellent book on exposure. But to follow it to its limit you need a good DSLR to practice with to completely follow it.<br />I have a &#34;bridge&#34; camera that doesn't have all the functions mentioned in the book, so I'm a little handicapped without the use of a good DSLR.
B00CTEP7O4|5.0|Completely hooked on this show! Must watch tv, engaging, fun, and entertaining. Watch and you will not be disappointed. It is that good.
1451695195|5.0|This is a very interesting book that everybody should read, It gives a different perspective on the afterlife. Would recommend.
B003Y059EK|5.0|This movie has been known for traumatizing kids back in the 80's. But now watching it as an adult, it's a pretty good movie. The special effects are amazing, truly a gem from the 80's. But seriously, don't let the kids watch this!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love this game. A friend from work told me about this game and have been stuck on it ever since. I love the graphics on it. I hope they come out with some more levels soon.
B0063M22QO|5.0|I enjoy playing making verry much.  I can spend hours playing this game and get lost from everything going on arohund me.
B007PT1PEY|4.0|I read this on my wife's Kindle. What a delight! While we had some collections in hardback growing up, I had never read the entire Sherlock canon until now. I find myself returning to it again and again. Even stories that don't usually make the \\"greatest hits\\" lists have their own charms.<br /><br />As for the edition itself: the TOC works well, if a bit oddly; it's easy to access all the stories quickly.<br /><br />The illustrations are a delight. Totally unnecessary, of course, but fun to see the artist's vision of the same scene.<br /><br />This is definitely a Sherlock to consider.
B005HSL626|5.0|Love this game, makes waiting for anything a lot easier. My 4yr old also loves it I like that we can both enjoy the game together.
B004KPX4W2|4.0|some of these types of movies show the stars so long in the tooth but this one was just fun.  We're looking forward to watchin the sequel.
B009I2UH2W|5.0|Had to get this for the iphone 5.  Charges well but the bonus is it has a USB port so I can bring my white cord and charge two phones at the same time.  Would buy again.
B0041D843M|3.0|what was so surprising was to find out how many foods that was originally told that was good for you turn out to be bad for you. Also it was a good guide for nutrition and better living.  The information back up with studies that were completed over time in regards to certain nutrition facts.  It was a great book.
B0047Y17P2|5.0|Through the many twists and curves in the case, Connelly takes you into the defense attorney's mind as Michael Haller tries to find the winning strategy and questions  all of the possibilities. He keeps you guessing and wondering just how he is going to defend his client. One of Michael Connelly's best yet.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|I originally got this game for my 4yr old...but she can't read the instructions. So I figured I'd play around with it, and I've become addicted to it ever since. The game is challenging and tons of fkidun ever for adults.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|okay, my wife started playing the game and tlld me... now I'm playing it and also got soms of tbe kids in my Youth Group playing the game... pretty fun and due to it addicting nature, playing one hour a night. :-)
B005HEDI3K|5.0|I always loved this episode and it is even better with the new CG graphics. Well worth the time to watch it.
B004GYY714|4.0|I downloaded TuneIn Radio to use on my Kindle Fire HD a few days after I downloaded iHeart Radio.  TuneIn Radio was so much more intuitive to use and worked more smoothly on the Kindle Fire HD than the other one.  I might try iHeart again in the future but for now I prefer TuneIn.
B004TI5N38|5.0|I have enjoyed many of Baldacci's characters.  As always he weaves a plot which draws the reader in and provides very believable twists.  He has a very strong hero in Puller. He resolves the story in a manner which makes me want to read the next book with Puller. I would encourage political intrigue fans to read this as I found it to be a very involved story going back to the Cold War days.
B00CDTSQZW|1.0|I have to say that I thoroughly enjoyed this show while it had its run on television. However, this is about the pricing. For only 9 episodes, the blu-ray release of Vikings at that price is WAY beyond reasonable. Whoever is producing this release needs to rethink that. Why would any consumer pay $60 for this when they can go and buy another hit show like Hannibal on blu-ray for half the price?  I hope the price goes down before release date, because I'd really like to have this.
B00A8307BG|3.0|First time I saw R.T. was 1974 and this didnt meet me my expectations. Rockers should stick to Rock or just flame out!!!
1595828095|4.0|I had hoped this would have been reproduced on comic book paper. The shiny book paper used is well done, but because comic book newsprint is not used, it takes away from the authenticity and tactile experience from reading a comic book.
B009NFHF0Q|3.0|was a fun read had a few twists i wasn't expecting. Sometimes the mystical wish it really could be is fun.
B004LL1HM4|5.0|I was born in 1958, and still cling to my folk heroes: Joni Mitchell, Loggins and Messina, Cat Stevens, Jethro Tull, etc, and of course Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young (and all versions of their band).  My teenage son introduced me to this band (Fleet Foxes), and I was bowled over.  Fantastic harmonies, unique lyrics and rhythms, and a fun addictive style.  May CSN&Y forgive me, but my first thought was that they sounded very much like them, except they did not have their pitch problems.  I also own Fleet Foxes, the first album by the band.  Both are terrific.  Give it a go.
0307704076|2.0|I went to BA conference at Calgary and won a lot of books. Thought I am a linchpin after that!!! Switch and this book are some. I got bored reading Seth's repetitive lost poem with no rhyme.<br />Why these gullible people giving him five stars while he invites them to see things as they are? Pragna<br />I invite everybody to find Kalama Suththa from Buddhist text. At least English version if you don't understand Pali<br />Remember genius marketer Jim Ron. Seth stole some of his. Jim is a clever and multi level marketer too.<br /><br />It is not fair to blame Seth for not giving a map for linchpinism. Find your way. There may be infinite ways to linchpining. Don't try to find cook books for this new found 'ism'. You got what you paid for<br />Now he scratched you brain surface.. What next...<br />Do you want retreat to Cancun for 7 days and have 'Zen' with new workshop. I am not surprised if he sells that.<br />Remember you can't always be linchpin but you need to excel at where you can be. Oh that is an art! Come on down and stay with cogs too. Hahaha<br />Please read all comments of 1 and 2 star reviews too. Then you see emperor has no cloth too.<br />I am disappointed because this could done in one blog. But cha Ching !!!

B006LSZECO|2.0|This was a FASCINATING, well written book that I was unable to put down -- but the ending was so disappointing that I almost felt like I'd been duped by reading it.
B0009FU0ZQ|4.0|... and a great supporting cast, too! Tom and Joe (he plays Reggie) express so much emotion with just their eyes! The network should have financed this as a new series.
B006VFLIYK|5.0|This novel has all the key ingredients we've come to expect from Baldacci in addition to being allowed to remain inside the mind of a trained killer. While we've had momentary visits and glimpses into the minds of the bad guys previously in other works, it was a bit disconcerting to stay there--even knowing the main character is a good guy doing bad things with the endorsement and support of his country. Read it!
B003Y7PM5E|5.0|If you liked the CD, you should hear it on vinyl with a good system. it sounds clean and localized and fills a house without the fabrication of the digital age. It's like the 2011 tour in my Library
B00D41AJ7G|5.0|a simple game, this is definitely a great app for those who like puzzles. the app runs smoothly on my Samsung galaxy 3.
B00CM9JL4S|4.0|This album has the potential to divide Orphaned Land fans.  It is certainly a back-to-basics album, although Orphaned Land never released a basic album.  Instead of centering the sound on musical variety and progression, with this, Orphaned Land have centered on a more focused sound.  The themes are darker, lyrically and musically, although the death growls are absent, favoring instead a textured Middle Eastern vocal pattern.  On my first listen, I thought the music extremely simple in comparison to previous efforts, but subsequent listens have revealed subtle progression.  The band, in short, is getting better at what they do, and they certainly showcase it here.  The downside is that the talent is much more obvious on albums like ORwarriOR or the glorious Mabool.  The upside is that this album can serve either as easy-listening in the background, or you can dive in and be immersed in the subtle but definite magic of this release.  While, to me, this is not a five star album, you can certainly tell that, despite the relatively short period between this and ORwarriOR (when compared to the gap between Mabool and ORwarriOR), this album was not released until the band was satisfied that they had put together exactly what they had meant to.<br /><br />For old fans of the band, this album is a must-have.  For those who have not heard of Orphaned Land, this album may be more accessible, but if you prefer death growls and a harder edge, seek out Mabool or ORwarriOR and enjoy.<br /><br />As with all Orphaned Land albums, the lyrics on this album are some of the most relevant and intelligent in the genre.  It is no easy task, especially, I would imagine, for an Israeli band, to attempt to bridge the gaps between the ethnic groups in the Middle East, but these guys tackle the issues with integrity and purpose.  Perhaps most incredible is that they do so without sounding overly preachy - they do not present answers, but they are able to present the issues without sounding one-sided, which in itself is a remarkable achievement.
B0040I09RM|5.0|We just got Amazon Prime and love it.  We always wanted to see Sons of Anarchy, and it was well worth the wait.  We're not happy with Breaking Bad not being on the free list though...
B00015YVD6|4.0|My daughter has been watching some series about mermaids called, really(?), H2O. So I though she would get a kick out of this movie I remembered fondly.......not. There is no explanation of why (spoiler)Tom Hanks can breath under water at the end of the film and this was the straw for her.....too bad...it was a great date movie back in the old days.
B0046B3QTG|5.0|Watched it twice in 24 hrs! Great for kids and adults. Funny and heartfelt. Well done movie! A must see!
030758836X|5.0|...can be hard to discern in this engrossing novel. Flynn is a gifted novelist who does a virtual literary striptease, revealing just enough to keep you returning for more (the book was impossible to put down for any length of time) without letting you in on the whole nine yards. You find yourself believing - and rooting for - both the husband and wife at different points, not knowing whom to believe.<br /><br />Some people liked the ending, some did not. Personally I thought it was fitting and a more complex resolution than the 'easy out' the author could have taken (I would have been disappointed if the author had gone for that low hanging fruit). We discussed this book at length at our book club at work, and it was interesting to hear all the different perspectives and perceptions of the characters. A very good piece of work with very complex, layered characters, it's a book that will have you thinking about the characters long after you finish it.<br />[[ASIN:030758836X Gone Girl: A Novel]<br /><br />  dxiffj DUI
B00004Y6NP|5.0|One of my favorite albums.  Now that my last tape deck went to a well deserved reward, I had to replace it.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This is the best game ever but if you know when 0.7.2 is comin and you have kik kik the answer to SLIMSHDY THANKS
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Great game with new updates and courses keeping it challenging!  Definitely a game to download and play.  Great challenges and tasks to complete to give you objectives and goals.
B0036S4B6M|1.0|I had only so so feelings when it came to reading this book. I bought it because I had watched the Netflix series and found it to be interesting. The book didn't hold my interest but I forced myself to read it all hoping it would get better but...... The series is much better then the book.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love this app my little brother loves this app almost as much as I do. When we all go somewhere I have to grab my Kindle fire and go.
B002ZG99TK|1.0|This was a terrible movie and a waste of ten dollars.  I'm not sure how anyone could like it.  The entire story wasn't believable and it dragged on so bad that I almost fell asleep.  If you must, do a Redbox.
B000UZPIAW|5.0|Awesome book with a great turn out in the end a can't put down kind of book sad scary but real
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Fun game for anyone. Kept me thinking and wanting more.  Levels are challenging but not complicated and allows you to use your imagination by guessing where the clues maybe hidden.
B009XIXVU6|3.0|It was difficult following the characters. Reading on a Kindle did not allow me to flip back and forth easily.
0553801473|5.0|This was well worth the wait! After the fourth book, A FEAST FOR CROWS, I was kind of annoyed that the author was focusing on characters that i did not really care about and I just wanted to hurry up and get through it. A Dance of Dragons is a different story. I was hooked at the prologue and have been trying to pace myself so that I do not just devour the book. I can't wait for the next installment. If you like epic tales about kingdoms and realms, money and power, and magic and sorcery set in a faraway time and place then give this series a read. Just make sure you start from the BEGINNING.
B00D2K40WY|5.0|This is the best princess game.  It would be nice if everything would be unlocked on the free version and not just on the version that you have to pay for.
B000002AZ8|5.0|For me it was the entering of pearl jam in the &#34;overmusic&#34; issue. this was their first album in which they did more than music. Its art is very cool.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I'M IN LOVE WITH THIS APP, SUCH A GOOD APP AND GAME! IT'S VERY FUN AND IS GOOD QUALITY TO HAVE.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This is book, would highly recommend to everyone, break out the tissues your gonna need them, I love a good book that makes you cry.
B00985E3UG|5.0|This is a very informative book and one that is hard to lay down once you start reading it.  Should be required reading.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|One of the best series - ever!  Another good show that was cancelled way too soon.  Love, love, love it!
B0045DO8LK|5.0|This Album is part of my life. it was stolen from my backpack and i now want to recover it,
B009UX2YAC|5.0|i luv how it automatically updates and thats its free with out this app my kindle wouldnt be that fun........SIKE.......my kindle be crackin but any wayz i really recommend this game
B007A2O3FO|5.0|Anything with Maggie Smith is sure to be a hit. BBC can get their message across with class and without vulgar language and undue violence.
B008ZOHCKE|2.0|Easy to use and unlike the one I replaced, it saves my work automatically.  This is a good app. Word
B0026QC0TA|4.0|good movie --- good cast --- well done. what else do I need to say to satisfy you? I liked it
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is so awesome i love it i hope u guys do to i am addicted to it there raley any ads so ots so addicting
B000063DGC|5.0|One of my favorite albums, Randy Rhoads helped define modern Rock'n Roll guitar!<br /><br />Bit old-fashioned and like to have physical media in my collection. I have it on vinyl, so is one of the few albums that I did not have in my iTunes. Time to go digital on this one.
B00DJFIMW6|1.0|so I bought the app and I watched the opening video and then it came to a loading page...and I haven't been past that. lol I have played this game on my friends ipod and SOOOOOO much fun but I wouldnt recomend it on here... still trying to get it to work lol. Also, if anyone knows how to get past that loading page pls write a reveiw because I would really like to know : )
B008XNZMOU|5.0|My students loved this and we listen to it all the time. Hope she puts out more. Came fast and in excellent condition.
B0050AV5MW|5.0|I like the epic nature of it.  A bit Genghis Khan.  Tyrion's character very well written, he's a favourite.  The book moves well, not many slow areas at all.
0449911357|5.0|I read this book all over again for a second time. I love how this story shows strong women and how it shows that love can be more than romance. It can be found in friendship too. A tall southern story with a wonderful plot. A classic for lovers of southern writing.
B004EBT5CU|5.0|Cant really say enough about Adele's style -- she has me in her spell whether she is rocking one of her own compositions or movingly interpreting someone else's. One talented young woman!
B00992CF6W|5.0|Easy to access and use - tons of fun!  We had the PC version and the keys kept getting stuck when playing the game.  No issues at all with this version.
B0011XEUP6|5.0|This is an old LP  I listen to it. Glad I have have it. Collectors item. better get you one.
B0053O89KG|5.0|Have not seen the show while it was on primetime. I was able to watch Seasons 1, 2, 3 with my premier account for free.
B0064X7FVE|3.0|The newer versions must be being created by Microsoft. It uses more power, and is slower than previous versions.  The KISS principle applies to apps!
B0018QOIXU|5.0|Cant really say enough about Adele's style -- she has me in her spell whether she is rocking one of her own compositions or movingly interpreting someone else's. One talented young woman!
1250007208|5.0|In the beginning I really thought I would hate this book because I'm not very fond of books about robots or living electronic machines, but it surprised me and I ended up loving it. Every time I put the book down I would get overwhelmed and pick it back up. I don't think I got bored at all, though at the beginning it is a little hard to catch on to what the characters are talking about. But it doesn't take long for you to figure out how they mentally group people.<br /><br />This book takes place in New Beijing near Europe. Now, in a lot of books I don't go too far into the accuracy of the geography because most books I read take place in America, but this book seemed fairly accurate. And not just with the geography, it's accurate about the government, too. (If you overlook the countries working together and the Lunar people)<br /><br />I also liked how they made it a Cinderella tale, sort of.. I could pinpoint the key paragraphs that follow Cinderella.<br />The book has a twist to it! I was predicting things left and right and at certain parts I was just like \\" OMG OMG OMG!\\" or *sucks in breath* That did NOT just happen?!?! :O<br />So in the end, the book is very predictable but you don't know you're right until you change your prediction<br /><br />There were two things I didn't like about the book. First, I didn't like the fact that the family was soo damn mean! And I know the author meant for it to be that way but I'm so kind-hearted I just flinch and get super sad when I witness bulling or people not being treated equal. So I guess that really doesn't count.<br />Second, the cover shows a picture of a leg and red heels, and you can barely see the robotic part. I would guess that it's Cinder, right?? But in the book she isn't wearing red heels like that and her leg is completely robotic. The leg on the cover looks like it had skin-grafting. And it clearly states that Cinder's leg is silver. Maybe I'm just looking too much into it...
B000NHG7BQ|5.0|Came in the mail very well. I like this movie. Everyone should get this and watch it. Kevin is great in it.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|v1.1 brings El Macho's Lair and the purple minions! My first running game and hooked from the start, and not just cuz it's so darn cute. (Watch a minion recover from running into something, poke different body parts on the start screen or in the shop). Having Facebook friends that play is a must for completing achievements, 3-5 should be enough. I've only found at most 2 of the 5 free daily tokens, but you can get more freebies thru Tapjoy. Fast, fun, and highly addictive!
B005VPRETE|5.0|I bought this for my daughter to give to a friend for her birthday.  I was hesitant, since I didn't know how much the birthday girl liked building things.  I needn't have worried.  Her eyes just lit up when she opened it.<br /><br />The set is \\"medium\\" in size.  Children will likely need some help getting everything set up to get building, but after that, will likely not need too much help doing the actual building.  The colors of the set make for some engaging discussions on the relative merits of design over realism, and my daughter and her friend had a great time trying to mix and match elements for the silliest misdesign.  The smallest pieces are a recipe for getting lost, but Lego has considered that and thoughtfully provides duplicates of the smallest bits \\"just in case\\".<br /><br />As usual, the instruction booklet is clear and makes the process required to get the \\"correct\\" (my daughter argues this point) result easy.  Easy enough that I think Lego should bid on doing \\"some assembly required\\" instructions for other companies!<br /><br />I like the fact that Lego is trying to expand their market to include those kids who aren't as interested in the typical Lego systems.  I have seen an improvement in my daughter's spacial recognition and task focus since she started building Lego sets.  Is that because of Legos or because she's getting older? Who cares! She loves her (& now her friend's) Legos.
B004EWEX9Y|1.0|The main reason I bought this was to access my Amazon videos, it simply did not work. I tried using it for youtube also and it did not work. I am so disappointed. RETURNED!
B00000J2PH|5.0|Great CD.  Came quickly  to me.  Reminds me of my younger years! It was a much simple and carefree time when I didn't have so many problems.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|HE PLAYS IT ALL THE TIME-EVERYDAY SINCE I DOWNLOADED IT....WOW...I LIKE IT TOO.  This is one of the best free downloads I have experienced in a while.
B0041KKYBA|5.0|This documentary shows how deep the corruption is in our government as a whole and how they let Wall Street ruin peoples lives. Too bad there isn't some vigilante that will go out and take care of the people that are above the law.
8170262259|1.0|I've owned both the French and English versions of this story -- and have loved it for many years.  I loaned out my Eng version and have regretted that a great deal so was pleased to be able to replace it in my personal library recently.
B00AB0Z88S|1.0|I could only take 20 minutes of this stinker (and even that much was torture) before I pressed the stop button. It is extremely boring and personally hard to understand since its narrated by a man from india. I know this film gets very good scores but IMO it sucked fat donkey. Oh, its true!
B0083Z6AH6|5.0|Wonderful just wonderful! There's a reason why Jane Austen is known all over the world. Her books are beautifully written and her stories heartwarming. It makes you rediscover and appreciate the English language for all it's beauty. She wrote in a time when the spoken word was everything. She was someone who certainly knew how to use the English language. Thank you Jane.
B000QCSA54|5.0|I would highly recommend this book to anyone. I was informed of the book in a magazine that said it was one of the best biz books of all time. Way more then a biz book. Seth Godin is an incredible author with great vision
B00BLRXDTQ|5.0|Mel Gibson was great. It has a great story line. You have to watch all three movies to follow the plot.
B008OOYALE|3.0|this game can get Very laggy on my kindle (1st gen)  and force closes it more then I would like. That said, I do like the game - the dragons are cute and most of the people I have &quot;met&quot; are very nice and helpful. it needs a few tweaked in that being able to gift only 3 people daily stinks - I have 2 kids playing this and it only leaves me 1 gold to use for neighbors - you have to keep your own list of gift givers because the game erases the names after a certain number, as of now I have a really long list that I have no hopes of ever catching up, I feel bad making people wait so long. I also wish visiting your neighbors easier - like you could go from one to the next without returning to the main page - it takes hours to go through my whole list!!!!  my girls and I are having fun building up our dragons and visiting others and have not had to spend any real money....
B004HO6I2E|5.0|Loved this movie!  Same old story, blah, blah, but damn funny.  First time I've seen Bateman be outside the &#34;Bateman Box&#34;, shall we say.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|Recommended by a friend I trust for great reading suggestions.  Our book club will discuss this soon and lots to discuss!  Grabbed me from the start and left me breathless at the end.  Super read!
B00CMQX84A|3.0|not a very good movie but the beach looked alsome  it alright i love giggles lol and seacat good at this.
B00BR1EZ3O|5.0|This was a very entertaining movie. Clint Eastwood was awesome. He kept you wondering what he was going to do next. It was both funny and suspenseful.
B009DCOU9S|3.0|A little to wordy on the dialogs. Pictures are good. Not much guidence on how to do a task. Some things dont make sense, guess thats the magic part. Search and find with movable items. Some other puzzle type screens. An ok time waster. Played thru level 14. some things won't work unless enlarged and repeated touch till it activates.
B00DW3X07M|5.0|I have listened to a lot of great recordings in my time. But this album really knocked me off my feet. Yes, it's geared toward the more fusion inclined audience. But don't let that stop you from listening this masterpiece. More keyboard oriented than Virgil's past offerings, this recording shows off great songwriting mixed with tight interplay, intricate melodies and some of the most amazing drum parts anyone will ever hear. Virgil's classical influence shines throughout several tunes: \\" Paradise Lost \\" and \\" The Fall Of Dreams \\" wear that classical influence well, whereas a tune like \\" Red Air\\" has a steady hypnotic groove with lots of guitar harmonic overtones. \\" Eleven \\" should satisfy those musicians that like their heroes to stretch musical limits, if not for the shear fun of making music that will never appear in \\" American Idol. \\"  Marco Sfogli ( of James Labrie's solo band ) and Alex Machacek make guitar contributions throughout parts of the disc to give the material a more rock oriented sound. But make no mistake: Virgil is the real shooting star in this collection of 5 star compositions. Don't hesitate. Get it and enjoy it!
B005LW5J9O|5.0|The shallow traditional mainline Protestant church-going experience, is certainly acceptable for its general comforting of the comfortable, as well as its congenial socializing, as is the liturgical ritual of Roman Catholicism, but it is neither inappropriate, nor blasphemous, to ask for some minimal awareness of the abiding substance of The Christianity Faith, for the two millennia of its existence, as human-beings have been affected, disrespected and violated. This extremely mature, sane, brilliantly researched and written Prized book, by a major scholar, ranks high on the list of the most important books I have ever read. &#34;Take up and read.&#34;
B00DULWFZE|5.0|I wasn't sure if I would like this cd, but I'm happy I bought it. To be honest, I thought the past albums were missing something - now with all 5 back together it really has a \\"complete\\" sound.  I love Breathe & Permanent Stain. I'm happy they are touring!!!  WAY TO GO GUYS
B002AOWXQ8|5.0|I spotted this on Amazon 'recommended for you' bit and saw the positive reviews here and decided I would give it a go. That was the best thing I did that day, I am new to the glorious sounds of 'Edward Sharpe and the Magnetic Zeros', but I intend to become fully acquainted after hearing this.<br /><br />They have been compared to the hippy culture of the late sixties and I don't think they would disagree. They reminded me in places of the aural joy you get in some of the songs of that time and the outpouring of love from shows like 'Hair' etc. They all have a go at singing and have a plethora of instruments including harmonica, accordion, trumpets and even a viola, but I am sure they have a few tambourines too. This is in no way cacophonous; it is a beautiful blend of nostalgia that is brought up to date exploding with the joys of life. I am a bit gushy there, but you have to hear it to get the full thing.<br /><br />Opening track '40 Day dream' is all percussion, keyboards and a riff that will pull you along effortlessly, but the mood changes on every track. 'Jade' is a low key love ode to, well Jade, who sings and plays percussion with the Zeros. Track 4 'Carries On' is my current favourite, but I love all of them. What I really appreciate is the way they all burst into song at the chorus a bit like Polyphonic Spree used to do, but this is miles better.<br /><br />'Kisses Over Babylon' is Spanish I think and just oozes emotion and 'Black Water' just keeps haunting me. This will not float everyone's boat, but if yours don't move then you really aint in touch with your inner child and have probably never hugged a tree let alone climbed one. I'm off to listen again and do some recreational medication (or have a cup of herbal tea - peace).
B007HACDLK|5.0|Very well written with a nice flow. The story is intricate, but because it is well written, it is easy to follow. I like the characters.
B00DMM3WVM|1.0|This is the only game that has frozen my Kindle no good it might be a good game but i will never know or try it again immediately uninstalled
B00C7E3EFU|5.0|Not my favorite Carpenter film, but it still beats any of the dreck being put out today. Great acting, great score, beautiful cinematography and perfect mood and tone, it truly is a classic. And this new edition from Shout! Factory has all the special features from the previous dvd PLUS a bunch more! A new interview with Jamie Lee, one with Dean Cundey, a new commentary track, a new little series called &#34;Horror's Hallowed Grounds&#34; which tours you through the locations of classic Horror films in a funny way and more and more... It really is chock-full of extras and goodies, definitely worth buying even IF you already have the special edition dvd.
B004O3YGMC|5.0|Wow I love this app. It's so amazing great job making this one guys! Totally worth the $4.99 that I paid!!!
B008P1EWIM|5.0|This is a great little app.  Very easy to use and absolutely gorgeous graphics.  I'm a weather hound and like to know what the weather's doing back east where my family is and other parts of the world.  Apparently though I'm not spelling the capitol of Iceland correctly.  See, I like to look at the weather in offbeat places. Get this app.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I have not been blown away by a book in a long time as I was by this one. Would love a sequel, but at the same time it's fun to speculate on all the f'ed up things the would do to each other.
B0059WTMLW|4.0|I love Sudoku whether it's on paper of electronic.  This version is easy to follow and even the easy ones are challenging.
B00BY8DIT2|5.0|Featuring one of the worlds greatest guitar players Joe Bonamassa and powerhouse vocalist Beth Heart you can not go wrong!!
B000063UR2|5.0|I have always loved this movie but about a year ago I was given the director's cut. It was good but not what I remembered. This copy had the version I remembered. I am very happy to be able to share this movie with my daughter so she can experience fantasy the way it used to be.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Became a big fan only a couple of years ago, don't know how I missed it.  Each actor is perfect for their character and the story line is fun and entertaining.  Not the usual sterile space ships and stations.  I wish there were more episodes.  Also loved the movie Serenity.
B00DJFIMW6|2.0|beacause when I download this app It not loading an it not loading at all. and also it just get stunk on the loading game I wait like 30 to 40 min and nothing happen. so I delete it that my case.
B00CWY76CC|2.0|Even when I got a couple hints I couldn't get past the first room.  When I solve a puzzle it doesn't let met get the hint I need to go forward.  Needs a better explanation on how the game works and better hints.
B0095ZQ36G|4.0|SHOWS that all Germans were not Nazis.  When you are ruled by fear (and madmen) you  often have little choice.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|This game is incredible! I hope they make a second game. It was well worth the money. AWESOME game for sure.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love this game because I get to play as the minion and buy clothes  for the minion, play games, and get bananas and Gru`s coins. Also you can complete missions.
B007GCY8FS|5.0|Jack Reacher is by far the best character in any series. Every novel seems to get better and better. Forget Alex Cross , Lucas Davenport , and Stone Barringtone . They are not in Jack Reacher' s league .
B0089LOG02|5.0|The author's description of the characters was so believable.  For me it was a five star because I could not wait to get back to reading it.  In addition, it very well could have happened!  Happy reading with this one!
B002GHIPYI|5.0|This review is from someone who typically buys headphones for running or noise-cancelling ones for traveling - and he/she isn't an audiophile. One may ask, &#34;Why would this be a good buy?&#34;<br /><br />Let me count the ways, let me count:<br /><br />- If you sit down and listen to music a lot in one place, these are uber comfortable for all-day wear<br />- If you are like me, you listen to music as background enjoyment. With these headphones, because of the sheer clarity and crispness - you'll love listening to your favorite songs in ways you haven't appreciated before<br /><br />An audiophile recommended these to me. I was so happy with these, I thought - why not buy more expensive ones from name brands and enjoy music even more? Truth was, it didn't happen! I bought headphones from $50 to $100 to $200, and bang for the buck, these Superlux beat them all. The sheer clarity and equal emphasis across the ranges (I think; I'm not too technical with sounds) make these headphones balanced and enjoyable.<br /><br />I highly recommend these for non-audiophiles or audiophiles who like saving a buck or two!
B003ODIZL6|4.0|When I was reading I discovered mercenary and Jesus<br />Lord God I bless your name below prayer and forgiveness of you
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I like this type of game.  It was sometimes frustrating and I occasionally tapped at random to get something to happen.  Would like more levels.
B00AIBZJLG|5.0|It exceeded my expectations. It combines different segments from touring shows and Las Vegas shows. If you can't afford to see a live performance this is a good compromise.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Please make new level. Very addicting can't wait...Please put new ones out really really soon. Picked it up and started playing tonight. Very fun challenging yet easy to catch on to
B00DYTKKGI|2.0|Only 4 patients and each is a repeat of the one before so no new activities<br />Perhaps with the upgrade pack it would be better but I don't see anything promising<br />at this point.
B00DRPVE3M|3.0|It's a good game and a good idea but if you get it for free once you run out of game tokens you have to wait a few days or BUY  more which I don't like. My advice for that is to uninstall the game then reinstall it. It's a pain but it works.
B0013TXA5Y|4.0|I wasn't sure if I would like the story but I have to say I read it in a day. There was some parts that didn't flow perfectly but it kept you turning page after page. The ending seemed a little final for a series but I have a love hate for cliff hangers. I read one reviews that really had me not wanting to read this book because I love Harry potter and I didn't want to read a poor versions of the books I love but honestly I didn't see anything that reminded me of it. Just read the book you will enjoy it.
B00992CF6W|5.0|It's that good! No, not good, AMAZINGLY SPECTACULAR! I don't know about you guys, and girls, Buy it, you won't regret it! Not  PC,  but this has earned my approval!

B00C28J2VQ|2.0|If you like blurred image ,backsides ,and ghosting you'll love this. I only review 3-D and this one you should save your money and get the regular DVD. My problem is if an actor makes a good 3-D I buy on preorder not considering that the Directors and studios are the ones producing the films. This is the last though because I'm going to start tracking the Directors.

B0064X7FVE|1.0|I don't like the new version. It is not very user friendly and the format is not very easy to understand. For those of us that have been using the website and the app for years, this upgrade doesn't make sense. I wish they would go back to the previous version
B004MC8CA2|1.0|I loved using this Bible everyday until yesterday when I opened the app and it began an update.  It totally messed up the whole thing and I can not find any way to fix it.  The only version available now is KJV and that will not even work.  The list of books is stuck on Alphabetical and won't give me the option of changing it.  As it is, the whole app is not useable.  I am highly disappointed.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|I just have a suggestion. I have harvesting all the time. your should create a 'tidal wave' or some kind of helper fish critter that will harvest for you. it could cost 1 pearl or 200 sand dollars or something to send it through and harvest everything available at that time, once. If you like the time it saves you harvesting you can buy it again. Harvesting was fun at first but its getting too overwhelming now.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|This game is well done and fun to play,the graphics are great too. My kids and I have had a terrific time playing it.

B004EAQNO4|4.0|I bough this as a gift but I did see it with her, and thought that it could have been much better than what it is.
B00D6OV57O|5.0|For sure a must have. The grave tone, the suspense, the grief, the excitement, the metals, the voices, the rare moments of softness. Everything in this soundtrack is an endeavor to take the listener to augmented levels of emotions, nobility and audacity. This is certainly one of the best original score of all time. HZ manages to impress even when using the same elements that are characteristics of his works.
0345529057|5.0|My absolute favorite book series.  You will get lost in these books as soon as you start them.  Plus this four pack makes it real convenient to read.

B00355L2TU|5.0|I've been needing a really good workout to do at home. The &#34;30 Day Shred Season 1&#34; is perfect for my needs. It doesn't take terribly long, and is definitely not boring. After I've finished the workout I feel like all my muscles have been worked and it gets my heart rate up as well.

B000089CJI|5.0|The cd arrived promptly and in good condition which is all I could ask for since it was already known that I loved the cd.
B00CRWJ5GO|5.0|I did not think it would be possible in my lifetime for a movie to surpass Apocalypse Now as my greatest movie of all time. Cloud Atlas does. Like a symphonic work of one of the great composers, the theme of Cloud Atlas is interwoven throughout the work with masterful skill and careful attention.<br /><br />Indeed there will be those who don't get it. Ironically, in many respects, the folks who don't get it are a major theme of this movie. Hence, why Cloud Atlas is such a tremendous achivement, indeed a masterpiece.<br /><br />At the time, and in its context, Apocalypse Now was also a \\"bomb\\". Upon further reflection, however, and more viewings, it became apparent to many that Apocalypse Now was a tremendous achievement in film.<br /><br />Cloud Atlas suffers from the same tragic treatment by critics and those who refuse to allow an objective perspective on a movie. Upon subsequent review, an objective critic will most likely reflect differently upon this film, once they realize what Cloud Atlas has achieved.<br /><br />Again, this movie now sits firmly at the top of my list of greatest movies of all time. To supplant Apocalypse Now for the top spot was not something I expected out of Cloud Atlas and I am so very pleasantly surprised. Thank you so very much for making such a wonderful work of art.

B00065MDRW|5.0|The era of freedom, when you can do anything you want over your instruments, experiment, create, play. Just let flow your pure ideas. King Crimson is the great audition sensation of the early years of Rock Progressive, opening a big path for many other bands. This is simple necessary to listen.

B00DURILJ2|5.0|I underestimated Matthew McConaughey when I first noticed him in as a 'serious' actor in \\"A Time to Kill\\".  He has matured and grown within his craft and this movie \\"Mud\\" shows his acting chops to its finest.  Buy this movie - worth every cent.
B00BQ1D7X4|5.0|If you are an old school alice fan, you will really like this album. William is definitly not Layne but he does really well. Jerry's music writing and lyrics are true to the AIC tradition. Just listen to lab monkey and you'll get it.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|this game is awesome except when I try to get a token pack or a bannanna pack it says there's no pack available.
B008JFUPFI|4.0|I didn't really want to see this movie. I'm not a Superman kinda girl. If I was, I prefer Christopher Reeves. The last Superman movie was awful (Superman Returns). However, I did enjoy many elements in this CURRENT installment of the Superman franchise. I liked the more science-fiction element of the movie. It begins on Krypton (sp?) and gives the audience a better understanding of Superman's origins. It actually made sense and didn't rely so much on \\"comic book\\" logic. It actually sounded plausible.  I'm not a comic book reader, but the stories behind some of these characters are so out there, I'm like \\"Yeah, right.\\" Don't get me wrong. I have enjoyed most of the movies so far that have come from comics, so no hate comments PLEASE!  I watched the cartoons as a kid. I loved X-Men and Spiderman cartoons. Although I did have to adjust to the way the characters were portrayed on the big screen. I never heard much about Iron Man, but the movies are now part of my favorites...Go RDJ!<br /><br />But I'm getting off the subject. I was impressed with Superman's back story. I liked the fact that he had a spiritual background that was brought prominently to the front. The hero is just an average person like anyone else who is searching for his identity. When he finds it, he has to make a choice.<br /><br />Henry Cavill does a pretty good job. But he was just big for no earthly reason! Well, they saved money on not having to pad the costume. I think anyone could've played Lois Lane the way Amy Adams portrayed her. And why was Laurence Fishburne in this movie at all? Did he need gas money for his jet or something? Kevin Costner was Kevin Costner, doesn't matter which movie. Loved Christopher Meloni! Ok I just like him because I liked his character on Law & Order so he can do no wrong. Russell Crowe was creepy as always. And the antagonist played by Michael Shannon was convincing, very convincing! His haircut probably added to the (whisper this now:) \\"I think he's insane\\" factor.<br /><br />I didn't give it 5 stars because some of the fight scenes were boring. How? They kept repeating the same sequences: someone's thrown into a building completely destroying it and they get up unharmed. Someone ELSE is thrown into a building completely destroying it and they get up unharmed. No variety. Nothing to make me say, \\"Did you see that?!\\" But I do recommend this movie even if you don't want to see it. It has a plot!<br /><br />More reviews at [...].<br /><br />I didn't give it 5 stars because some of the fight scenes were boring. How?

B00AQO1VYY|5.0|Guitar, bass, drums and vocals. A little saxophone. No synthesizers, no butt-shaking, and thank God, no damned Autotune. Straight-ahead Rock. It's an old recording, but the studio version is clean and sounds pristine. The live CD sounds pretty good, too. Too bad this collection of excellent musicians did not record more music together.

I really enjoyed the real world vs VR danger being so intertwined for the PCs.<br /><br />Very well done. Highly recommend.<br /><br />PS: When we get our VR world. Please give us this. A place for education to give students and teachers a safe place to learn and teach. This is what our planet needs more than a game. We need Ludus, someone please go build it!
B00BHBBSZ2|5.0|Just what I've been looking for! Can't change the background color, but there are plenty of interesting backgrounds to choose from. PERFECT for college. You can even handwrite your notes if you like. It might take a little fiddling to get used to it, but if you compare to other journaling/note apps, it's worth it!

B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is a lot of best of the movie and best of temple run put together this game is addicting and doesnt get old love it
B009LQKHIO|4.0|I thought this was a good story and I enjoyed it; however the multiple spelling and grammar errors were quite distracting for me.  I think it is too bad when an author has good ideas for a story and develops the plot well, but the editing is so poor.  I would think it would be embarrassing to the author.<br /><br />I did enjoy the story though and will probably read the next one in the series.
B00BEIYMAG|3.0|\\"The Conjuring\\" did scare me, but twenty minutes after I left the theater, I'd momentarily forgotten that I'd just seen it. While I was watching it I got a little bored and some scenes tempted me to laugh. If you've seen 1963's \\"The Haunting,\\" 1973's \\"The Exorcist\\" and 1944's \\"The Uninvited\\" you've seen three much better films from which \\"The Conjuring\\" gets its bag of tricks.<br /><br />Probably any clever film student could make something like this movie. We all know the basic ingredients: a large, old house in an isolated setting. The house should be attractive but something about it makes it ugly. It's in New England. It's autumn: cold winds blow skittering dead leaves. An innocent family moves into the house. The family is generic, without too many details; they are All-American and the audience can identify with them. They do normal things like go to the beach and watch \\"The Brady Bunch.\\"<br /><br />Their new home contains many dark and dusty nooks and crannies. There are antique curios that look a bit menacing.<br /><br />Suddenly, during a quiet night, a strange noise is heard. For some reason, no one in this family ever switches on normal lighting. Rather, they use weak flashlights or match flames.<br /><br />An innocent child arises from bed in a long white nightgown. She moves slowly, slowly, slowly, down a dark hall to investigate the noise. The scene is very quiet, very long, and very repetitive. You know that eventually the innocent child is going to come across something unusual: a vision of a hanged person, the reflection of a ghost in a mirror, or something truly terrifying, an IRS man there to conduct an audit.<br /><br />You know that at the same moment that the defenseless family member sees the unusual thing, the previously silent scene will burst with sudden, loud, and oppressive noise. The sudden vision and noise will startle you, and you will be scared. What you paid the ticket price for. Oh, and the family dog dies, birds act weird, and mom is bruising easily.<br /><br />At first, of course, everyone in the house writes off these events as mere chance. Everyone is rational and is not tempted to believe in the supernatural. Eventually someone in the family levitates or clocks stop or people feel cold or something. Just like in \\"The Haunting,\\" there are loud banging noises. Just as in \\"The Uninvited,\\" a family member is possessed by the dark energies of the house, and there is the ghost of a bad mother and a not-so-bad mother. Just as in \\"The Exorcist,\\" there will be an exorcism.<br /><br />So the team of experts is brought in. They speak some ancient language like Latin and possess arcane knowledge. I won't tell you any more because that would reveal the end of the movie to you, but I bet you can guess.<br /><br />I'll just say that at one point, the satanic shenanigans in the house reach fever pitch. Satan is beating the stuffing out of these poor fools. Any sane person would immediately evacuate. At that point a paranormal investigator, Lorraine Warren (Vera Farmiga) says, \\"Leaving the house won't help because the dark spirits have attached themselves to you.\\" OH COME ON. Vera Farmiga may as well have said, \\"You can't leave now because there's still forty-five minutes to go in the movie.\\"<br /><br />Vera Farmiga is a scintillating actress. She electrifies every scene she is in. Patrick Wilson is perfect as her husband; they have great chemistry. The movie wastes them, though. The filmmakers don't seem to realize that Farmiga's human depth and complexity are the best thing the movie has going for it, and utilizing that human power would have made their film a classic, rather than just another \\"Boo!\\" movie.<br /><br />\\"The Excorsist,\\" \\"The Haunting\\" and \\"The Uninvited\\" are all scary but they are also deep. They present big themes. \\"The Conjuring\\" avoids big themes. One character tries to kill another, and it's the kind of killing that makes your skin crawl. The movie makes no attempt to plumb these murky waters.<br /><br />\\"The Conjuring\\" misrepresents evil and Catholicism. When the Warrens arrive at the haunted house, Lorraine has a rosary strung from her wrist. Ed Warren places little wooden crucifixes around the house. In the exorcism scene, Latin is spoken. This isn't true spirituality; it's fetishism - the belief that objects and rituals possess supernatural power. They do not. Only God has power. I am a Catholic, I pray the rosary, and I believe in Satan. The force that defies Satan is not an object, a rosary, it is rather faith in God.<br />[[ASIN:B004WNTGYM The Haunting]][[ASIN:B00DZP1C8Q<br /><br />[[ASIN:B00DZP1C8Q The Uninvited (Criterion Collection) [Blu-ray]]]y waters.<br /><br />\\"The Conjuring\\" misrepresents evil and Catholicism.

B00C5W3SBE|1.0|The beginning of the movie in black and white, with its unlikely scenario, was a clue to the rest of the movie: boring and silly. The story was VERY poorly developed, and skids by on theatrics and visual gimmicks alone. There was no feeling established for any of the characters, good or bad. And the bad witch/sister turns her good sister into a bad witch worse than herself? And the good sister didn't know her own sister was evil? Please. Every opportunity to develop any part into an enjoyable, memorable, heart-felt scene, to create something believable out of something unlikely, was totally bypassed in favor of dullness. Thank goodness I rented the $1 movie, rather than going to the theater. What a let-down.
B009ANP4F4|5.0|I think its one of the better ones! A lot more dancing and free styling. This is the movie to see!
B0031Q0XCA|5.0|I love this movie, this happens with some relationships, I guess they're meant to be lol... Zooey Deschanel is a great actress by the way!

B0034DGPEU|5.0|Absolutely loved this book! It is written from two different view points but is straightforward and captivating. A sad tale of the old south, slavery, love, loss....I couldn't put it down. Definitely a little on the depressing side but I would totally recommend.

B004J4WKTW|5.0|Intriguing literary style.  The reader is &#34;participant&#34;. Wonderful escapism. If you believe in your ability to imagine, to fantasize, to sovereign puzzles, this is a captivating book. There are also practical philosophical musings to consider. Appropriate audience : precocious pre-teens, teens and adults.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|A primary goal of quantum theory is the explanation of reality and the role of human consciousness in bringing it about.  In QM, this is known as \\"the observables problem\\".<br /><br />\\"Proof of Heaven\\" by Eben Alexander, M.D., is the most scientifically well documented presentation of an NDE (Near Death Experience) I've ever heard of, and there are 10's of thousands of NDE's carefully recorded and itemized in academic compendia.  These include irreproachable reports from young children but which are, perforce, less scientifically well grounded than this one from a noted neurosurgeon.<br /><br />Coming from a standpoint other than quantum theory, viz. from his personal experience,  Alexander's insights into the interrelationships between body, mind, consciousness, and spirit (or soul), and what they tell us about reality, are extremely interesting.<br /><br />Martin Fricke, Ph.D.<br />San Diego

B009XIXVU6|3.0|Hosseini's first two books, The Kite Runner and A Thousand Splendid Suns were excellent reads.  This book was a little disappointing.  I waited for the story and characters to mesh but the stories of each character were so separated that there was no real satisfying ending.

B00DR0PDNE|3.0|The video quality isn't great and I ran into some trouble setting up, but I'd say overall it's worth $35.  Its value will increase as more services adopt their API.<br /><br />Don't buy it if you like the idea of the chrome tab mirror feature. I've tried it on several different computers and they're all super laggy.  Not useable for streaming video.
B000W7JWUA|5.0|Bought this for my brother as a gift . I have never played it before but after hearing so many ppl who were addicted to it it seemed the perfect gift for a board game lover.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|What a great novel! I haven't read a story this good--suspenseful, scary, and funny--in a long, long time. Well done. If you like NASA, SCI-FI, astronauts, and heroic tales with very well-drawn characters, read this book. You will love it.
B00CRS88IO|5.0|This was a real page turner. I loved every word. I have seen a few James Bond movies. My favorite is `Skyfall.' This book taught me a lot about 007's author and was also a great story. Fantastic!
B00CRS88IO|5.0|One of the most amazing things about this novel is Stevenson's ability to spin an amazing tile of intrigue while keeping the reader totally ensconced in the period. The historical details (architecture, fashion, societal standards) color in the era nicely without weighing the story down. Fleming by virtue of birth, occupies a rarified position in society. His agile mind and innovative ideas leads to a heart's desire of becoming a spy. Intrigue becomes a staple in his life as he courts women and danger in defense of his country. Historical minutiae and vivid storytelling combine into a thrilling read and it's easy to see how Fleming may have been the template for the spy of all times: 007.
B005D0RDKW|5.0|I went to this concert in Cincinnati and even though I was a bit disappointed with the sound of the Riverbank Arena I enjoyed the show.

B007SGM084|5.0|For some reason I waited to read the 50 Shades Trilogy.. My sister kept asking \\"have you read it yet?\\" And so finally I bought the books. I thought oh this will be good, I have 3 to read. I can take my time... But the minute I started reading 50 Shades I could not put it down. I was blown away about how truly great the story is. I guarantee that you won't be let down by these books! I finished them in 3 weeks!

B003CH9PV8|3.0|I loved Breaking Bad the first time I watched it on Netflix. I thought I would watch the whole series a second time (it's that good!) on Amazon for better quality and surround sound.<br /><br />Well I got that, and LESS! The first episode I watched on Amazon (the pilot episode) is CENSORED! I couldn't believe it! They bleeped out all of the F-bombs. And in one brief scene with nudity (where Jesse is climbing out of an upstairs window to escape the DEA raid), they digitally covered up a topless woman in the window.<br /><br />I don't like watching censored shows. Amazon should have made it very clear that their version was censored. It's not censored on Netflix, so I'll watch the rest of the episodes there for free.<br /><br />It's a great show - watch it on Netflix.

B00DJFIMW6|5.0|It's simple but very addictive and cute. I keep finding myself saying just one more time. 20 minutes later I'm still playing.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Awesome and joy come to mind after reading this book, I recommend this book to all who love reading and to all that like a good love story.
B00CAJMGDI|5.0|She is awesome!!  We love her music and listen to this album all the time.  Our 6 year old daughter loves it too.  Several of our friends now listen to her now too.
B009LH1Y1W|5.0|Very entertaining!!!  Funny, and serious at the same time!!! I very much enjoy watching Supernatural!!! :!))<br />Jensen ( dean)  is HOT ( by the way!! :)
B000SCHC0Q|4.0|This novel starts slowly, but is worth the effort. It is a window into the lives of women in Afganistan over the years from the monarchy, through the Soviets, the Mujahideen, the Taliban, and just a bit of the current occupation. More depth in characters would be good. Rasheed is written only from the voice of his wives. There was so much about him that we never discover. There is but one glimpse of Jalil.<br />All in all, a very difficult, heartbreaking, violent novel.
B00338QENI|4.0|Some of the medical background in the beginning can be confusing but overall an excellent book. I would highly recommend it.
159463176X|5.0|I liked this book almost as well as Hosseini's first novel, &#34;The Kite Runner&#34;, which caused such a stir!  This book is equally thoughtful and would recommend it to anyone with a serious desire to learn about a culture so different from ours.  It kept my attention to the very end.  Mr. Hosseini captures the human inner struggle like no other author!
B002SRQ214|5.0|Its a awesome CPU but,the CPU fan is loud i got a new one it is like 15% to get one.<br /><br />PC setup:<br /><br />Case: Haf 912<br />GPU: GTX650Ti BOOST<br />Motherboard: MSI Computer Corp.

B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Fun and sometimes challenging. It's a good kids game that will keep them occupied for awhile. A must download for all.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I am really loving this game!! Highly addictive and fun. Incredible graphics and fun to play!! It's a possible game of the year.
B004Y6MIXS|4.0|[[VIDEOID:1bb0cb29abc9a4f74d4ad5b95033a995]] AWUSO36NHA VS AWUSO36NH VS TP-LINK WN722N<br /><br />I purchase the awuso36h and then it went dead. It served me a good time. I decided to purchase the awuso36nh which is a 2w wireless adapter. This adapter was connected to my 15dbi Omni-directional antenna which is 40 feet above ground. I must confess it worked excellent until my alfa 1w booster (failed within a month). One thing for sure with this adapter it is very durable. ( I have this adapter for over a year. after my booster died I began to use this adapter alone and I picked up about 15-18 wireless access points, mostly with a 3 bar signal. my internet connection faded from time to time because of distance and interference and other factors. I decided to research on other adapters that has good receptivity and found several post as to the awuso36nha and how sensitivity it was to weak signals.<br />I also found post where the awuso36nha is good for hacking and packet injection in backtrack. i did some more digging and found some facts ,that is, the awuso36nh has sensitivity of around -71dbm while the awuso36nha has a sensitivity of -91dbm (excellent for weak signals). note these are all theoretical statements. i even read a web page that hakshop.myshopify.com as to how the auwso36nha is excellent.<br />when the awuso36nha arrived i downloaded the latest drivers from the official alfa site.I tested use the awuso36nha for six months.In addition i  used the AWUSO36NH for over 1 year. My tests and hard work came from Wireless Penetration and Comparative analysis in real life situations :<br /><br />NO. OF NETWORKS DETECTED<br />AWUS036NH-roughly 10-14 Networks<br />AWUS036NHA-roughly 22 Networks<br />TP-LINK WN722N-  3 to 4 networks ( i am assuming that the circuitry for this adapter wasn't designed for an amp with long cabling to outdoor antenna otherwise it worked well with a small indoor antenna)<br /><br />TRANSFER SPEED<br />AWUS036NH- 1 Mbps to 5Mbps for most networks<br />AWUSO36NHA- 20Mbps TO 54Mbps for most networks<br />TP-LINK WN722N- connected to 1 out of a total of the three networks in detected<br /><br />SIGNAL QUALITY (with a 5W booster)<br />AWUS036NH-Excellent (4 bars maximum for most networks)<br />AWUSO36NHA- Very Poor (1 to 2 bar signal for most networks-but was able to connect with better speeds than the awuso36nh)<br />TP-LINK WN722N- 1 to 2 bars<br /><br />INTERNET STABILITY<br /><br />AWUS036NH- unstable internet connection for weak signals<br />AWUSO36NHA- fairly stable internet connection for weak signals<br />TP-LINK WN722N- unable to test thoroughly<br /><br />RANDOM DISCONNECTIONS<br />AWUS036NH- Adapter does not shutdown randomly.<br />AWUSO36NHA- Adapter shuts down randomly, you have to manually plug and unplug adapter after a full day or 2 days of work.<br />TP-LINK WN722N- no random disconnection observed for short period of use<br /><br />HEAT GENERATION<br />AWUS036NH- Adapter gets hot quickly<br />AWUSO36NHA- adapter gets slight warm<br />TP-LINK WN722N- adapter gets slight warm<br /><br />HANDSHAKE TESTS- BACKTRACK 5 R3 AIREPLAY SUITE<br />AWUS036NH- Not excellent in grabbing handshakes- have to try a couple of times for the adapter to get it right<br />AWUSO36NHA- Excellent Handshake grabber!<br />TP-LINK WN722N-adapter gets slight warm<br /><br />REAVER 1.4 IN BACKTRACK 5 R3<br />AWUS036NH-Authentication with networks well and packet injection works fairly (16-20 pin/sec)<br />AWUSO36NHA- Authentications works well and packet injection is fast (4-8 pin/sec) however reaver sticks due to adapter random disconnection<br />TP-LINK WN722N- unable to test due to fewer unencrypted access points detected.<br /><br />CONCLUSION 1: the alfa awuso36nha is a good adapter when compared to the awuso36nh, that is, the awuso36nha provided a stable connection with good transfer speed even though it Gives A 1 TO 2 bars signal strength. On the other hand the awuso36nh provide a GOOD connection with less transfer rate and is not good at catching weak signals. so what is important?<br />TRANSFER SPEED vs SIGNAL STRENGTH?.. all two factors are important but i would go with signal strength since without signal you cannot transfer..<br /><br />UPDATE:<br />ALFA AWUS036NH IS SUITABLE FOR INDOOR USE WHERE ACCESS POINTS ARE RELATIVELY CLOSE<br />HOWEVER IF YOU HAVE A AN OUTDOOR ANTENNA, THE AWUS036NHA IF VERY GOOD AT PICKING UP MORE ACCESS POINTS AND CONNECTS WELL TO NETWORKS (DESPITE RANDOM DISCONNECTIONS AT TIMES AND A 1 TO 2 BARS SIGNAL STRENGTH). THIS IS THE ONLY ADAPTER WITH THE ATHEROS 9271 CHIPSET THAT IS BUILT INTO A CIRCUITRY THAT IS WELL DESIGNED FOR LONG RANGE CONNECTION AS COMPARED TO TP-LINK WN722N (I WILL SEE IF I WILL TRY TO  GET A VIDEO ON YOUTUBE TO SHOW THE COMPARISON BETWEEN THE THREE ADAPTER...ALL FOR NOWgood at catching weak signals. so what is important?<br />TRANSFER SPEED vs SIGNAL STRENGTH?.. all two factors are important but i would go with signal strength since without signal you cannot transfer..<br /><br />UPDATE:<br />ALFA AWUS036NH IS SUITABLE FOR INDOOR USE WHERE ACCESS POINTS ARE RELATIVELY CLOSE<br />HOWEVER IF YOU HAVE A AN OUTDOOR ANTENNA, THE AWUS036NHA IF VERY GOOD AT PICKING UP MORE ACCESS POINTS AND CONNECTS WELL TO NETWORKS (DESPITE RANDOM DISCONNECTIONS AT TIMES AND A 1 TO 2 BARS SIGNAL STRENGTH).

B004SYP5WC|5.0|Been using this app for the last month and so far it has served me well. It hasn't crashed or any thing like that. It's pretty useful and reliable.
B00E193TM2|5.0|I've been a fan since I first heard FFDP. This album is awesome like every other album. A must buy
B0064X7FVE|1.0|I loved the old version of this app. It was easy to use and I could check the weather at a glance. I will be deleting this app. If they go back to the old app or something close to it I will reinstall it.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I can't put it down.  Amazingly addicting. Both my kid and I are having a great time competing for the higher score.
0064409422|5.0|Pages are thick and glossy, pictures are in color. Excellent quality for the price. I bought 2 copies for presents.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Best book ever filled with action and plot twists this book is awesome!! Susan has really out done herself this time!
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Great game.  Can't wait for the next one. Challenging yet solvable.  Take your time and don't use the hints unless you are completely stumped.
B00D5O7BPU|5.0|Honestly, there are worse ways to spend a dollar on the Amazon app store.  I just wish they would update it already...
B006OOHYIC|5.0|This brain teaser is fun for u but work for the brain. keeps the gears turning. I wish there were 6stars
B00E193TM2|5.0|I bought this album because FFDP is my favorite band ... They are ROCK GODS!  I can't wait for the next one!

B00AREIAI8|5.0|Amazing game I love this game second best thing to a horse.. keeps getting better after every update .. I love it!!!
1439127700|5.0|It was fun to 'listen in' to what each President did and said.<br />And educational to read as well as learning what was really<br />going on.
B003204MQS|4.0|Filmed much like Blair Witch Project. each movie captivates me to see the next one! Will continue to watch as they continue to make
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|lawyer show with a big twist (one of the key players is not a lawyer) which is a continuing source of suspense.  All of the stars have distinct personalities; love that the managing partner is a sharp woman with tons of class.  The plot this season takes a definite turn when the former head comes back to stake his claim, adding another character to hate.
B003V4AK8E|4.0|This controller is quite comfortable to hold thanks to it's size and grip. The triggers may feel loose to those who are used to other types of controllers but are well built, none-the-less.The rest of the controller shares the trait of feeling sturdy and does not squeak when squeezed and etc. One small problem is that the D-Pad can sometime misfire if incorrectly pressed and multiple keys will be pressed instead of one. The sticks are incredibly accurate from my experience compared to that of other brands. One fault to this otherwise amazing controller is the charging port. This took a small amount of time before figuring out that it was NOT broken. It turned out that the problem was that the USB on the Playstation's end should not be in the whole way. In other words, it must be wiggled out slowly and slightly after being put in the entire way until the controller's buttons light up.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|my only problem with the game was that it was too short. I would love it if it came with another ten or more rooms.
B007OLYQ4E|4.0|The movie is much like the book for the most part. The end (which I will not give away is completely different), and certain parts are different but reading the original is completely worth it!<br /><br />If I could immerse myself in the world of Tiffany's I would.
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|Enjoy matching tiles. Like the automatic reshuffling. Colors are nice. Sound effects add to the experience. A pleasant way to exercise your brain.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Each time I think I have figured out how to handle puzzles and have an approach, wow something else comes along.<br />These are great to play with while watching boring tv.
B0091WFDBE|5.0|Love this movie!  Sure it's full of text book cliche's but it's just too much fun to watch the two of these guys.  Fun-Fun-Fun!!
B00BHNQ5XK|5.0|So dark and creeepy!!! creepy to the max. If you love scary movies, then you will love this movie. Watch it!
0525425772|4.0|This time around in John Grisham's latest and greatest kid lawyer novel, Theodore Boone is called upon to help prevent the loss of a friend's farming property to the local government to make way for a massive town bypass.  Obviously the project will be \\"good for the town\\" but up close there are some major problems as well as ethical and moral issues associated with it.  At this stage, all Theo can do for his buddy is refer him to his father.  And he does.  But at this stage, if this volume in this wonderful series sounds dry and uninteresting, then you would be right.<br /><br />But we forgive Mr Grisham for his apparent lack of excitement and emotional attachment to this book when we get to the half way mark when things start to get personal.  The metaphorical baddies cross the metaphorical line in the sand by doing some early survey work for the proposed bypass and all hell breaks loose.  I will say no more to protect the interests of the reader but four books in and the reader is more attached to young Theodore and his friends and family than you think.  Suddenly the pages are flying past your eyes quicker than you believe was possible and the stage is set for a dramatic battle and of course, you can't wait for the personal revenge.  Even Uncle Ike has his metaphorical boxing gloves on!<br /><br />And so I give his book a well earned four stars out of five.  If the first half contained a little more excitement, it would have been a classic.  But maybe next time, Mr Grisham!
B00D41AJ7G|4.0|A different use of my brain. The first few are fun, then they quickly get more challenging. Luckily I can progress at my own pace.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|I think this game is pretty cool with all the obstacles also there is the monster that chases you all around.
B00BEZTMFY|4.0|Another Fun Hobbit story, that theme could be carried on for books and never get old. Ian McKellen was Fabulous again.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|We love watching the program and discussing it.  The costumes, castle scenery and all is great and the plot justs adds up with each of the series units.  There is a lot to learn and much more to enjoy, hopefully they continue it to its logical ending
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Lots of fun for kids! Very realistic! My kids love taking care of the horse and entering in the competitions.
B000LPQ6DE|5.0|THE DVD SHOWED AN EXCELLENT PICTURES AND I HAVE COLLECTED ALL OF THE JANE EYRE MOVIES BUT THIS ONE SURPASSES THEM ALL. THE ACTING AND ROMANTIC SCREENS ARE ESQUISITE. TOBY STEPHEN IS VERY. VERY  HANDSOME AND EVEN RUTH WILSON WITH THAT HAIRDO IS STILL BEAUTIFUL.<br />THEIR WERE MORE INTERACTION BETWEEN EDWARD AND JANE  ROMANTICALLY  AND THEIR CHEMISTRY WAS DYNAMIC.THIS MASTERPIECE PRODUCTION TAKES YOU TO THE ERA AND YOU FEEL LIKE YOU COULD BE JANE BEING LOVED BY THE HANDSOME EDWARD.

B00AHXIC50|5.0|Bruno Mars is a true legend in the making, we are without a doubt witnessing the next MJ of this generation, I hope he plays his cards correct.
B009XY97VC|5.0|TSFH does it again with a plethora of awe inducing tracks.  All the intensity of an action movie, mixed with the subtle nuances of musical genius, and varied enough that you'll never get bored.
B00005221M|5.0|The condition was as stated, and the movie worked great. Very fast shipping. No real complaints. Overall, really happy about my purchase.
0800141660|5.0|Jane Austin books and movies are the greatest.  I have them all.  Anyone who loves to read about that era should love them.
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|I enjoy this series. The witty mocking nature of the characters and the script make the series an enjoyable experience.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I've always wanted a horse and now I can have one. you can groom it and it will love you back it's so realistic
B00CZAYNOC|5.0|Five Finger Death Punch has done it again with another GREAT album it is a must have for any fan!!!
B00BFUUMO8|2.0|What's amazing about this game is how they managed to make something as cool as dinosaurs into a game that makes watching paint dry seem like an epic adventure. At this point I'm only playing it to see what the aquatic park looks like.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|Great story, great characters. I started out watching the HBO show and wanted to read the books. So far I have not been disappointed.
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|This movie was so great blockbuster and Netflix didn't have it so I had to rent it from Amazon so my bf could see it before going to the 2nd movie I love how convenient it was. As for the movie its got everything for children and adults! Its so funny
B0031RAOVY|5.0|This film will make your heart sing - and your eyes fill with tears!  A wonderful film of love and loyalty!
B00BSBUZPK|5.0|Originally saw this on a cable show then had to purchase.  Great video with lots of memories.  I would recommend.
B00000IQW5|3.0|Older movie but not bad.  Good story and pretty factual.  Early Goodman and Dreyfus work pretty well together.  A love story.
B0089LOG02|5.0|This book brought home some of the heartbreak consequences of war and poverty and the unbelievable resilience of the human spirit.  Looking forward to Ms. Kline's next book!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Well I think this game is awsome you can get new and different brands of horse like zebra and pinto
B007ZXK08C|5.0|A real page turner - very intelligently written psychological thriller with just the right balance of pop culture.<br /><br />I couldn't put it down!
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|This series had me gripped for the entire week it took me to read. Every chapter ends in suspense only increasing your thirst to go the next.<br /><br />This series is a must buy for fiction lovers!
B00BHHIWQO|3.0|The jury is still out on this game with me. The ability to play with random opponents other than your friends list would make it better.
B00ADS90EQ|1.0|Prime instant video is a joke. The quality of the stream was so poor I could not stand to watch this movie. It would only stream at the lowest quality on my 30MB  connection. I had no problem streaming HD content from other sources at the same time so I know the problem is on Amazon's side. The movie is not available in HD on a PC but it can be in HD on an Ipad on the same network? I will not be buying any more videos from amazon until they do a major upgrade of there streaming service.
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|One of the most captivating and heroic stories I have ever read about Aerial Combat during WWII.  A great insight into the making of Bomber crews and fighter pilots from sides.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|I have read two other of his books the Kite Runner and Midnight Suns - this follows the pattern of great story telling over generations
B008XG1X18|5.0|This app was a very cleaver idea and I really enjoy it. It is very simple to use and takes little time. My family made a private page for our Christmas wishes and it made shopping the easiest ever! I highly recommend Pinterest. I've really enjoyed sharing gardening ideas on here too.
B00CISAPJS|4.0|Rented this for a family movie night particularly for my 10 year old but my husband and I were both surprisingly happy with it as well.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This is the third book of the trilogy. I liked the other two slightly better.<br />I gave a five star rating because of complex tech savvy events so nicely interwoven with the main theme of the story.
B008M87GJK|5.0|This is one of the two news apps I consistently go to when I want reliable, up-to-date information. The Kindle Tablet Edition only enhances the reader's online experience. I highly recommend this app for my fellow news junkies!
B004EPZ00C|3.0|I really liked the first Johnny English, but this one is not up to that level.  In the first  one, I began to think he was &#34;real and handsome&#34; :), but this one left that lacking
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|Gaiman is a master storyteller, and this tale is no exception.<br /><br />A middle-aged man returns to his hometown, to a farm and a neighbor family he once knew, and sits beside their pond that is really an ocean, and remembers:<br /><br />The narrator was seven years old when he met Lettie Hempstock.  When she took him to another world and brought him back.  When he faced demons and monsters and the end of the universe, and learned what true friendship was.<br /><br />As the man looks upon the ocean at the end of the lane, he remembers...<br /><br />This isn't Gaiman's best book, in my opinion - I loved 'Stardust'  and 'Anansi Boys' just a little bit more, as those stories had more charm and a sense of fun that this darker work lacks - but 'Ocean' is still brilliant, moving, and impossible to put down.  It has disturbing scenes, beautifully described, that may give you nightmares.  But you won't want the story to end.  You'll fall in love with the characters, the world, and the magic.<br /><br />Pick it up and read it.  It's amazing.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love subway surfed I play it all dontbstop can wait to china subway surfed come out<br />Subwsy surferrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr rrrrrrr rrrrr rrrrrrr rrrrrr !!!!!!!!¡!!!!!!!!!!!!!¡!!!!!!!¡!!!!!!¡!!!!!!¡!!!!!!!!¡!!!###!!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Great game especially for free. Great for kiddos and adults. Interact with your favorite cute little Mininon. Warning it is very addictive.
B00992CF6W|3.0|I really liked it but my kindle Fire HD kept shutting down when I put up a sign on minecraft that said  &quot; whale watchers society&quot; and it shut down 2 Times!!!!!<br />I'm sorry if I disappointed u guys but it's the truth! :(
B00B5DWI2O|5.0|This album was the feature album on my preferred radio station in Sydney Australia. It's a haunting at times and beautiful album that I play often and love a lot.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Such a cute game....Great graphics and you never get bored! The little minions are so cute! Anyone can play this game and it is not hard to beat the challenges!
B004J4WKTW|5.0|If you're looking for a fun and magical read, this is it.  I didn't want it to end and plan to read it again.
B007VUA7VO|4.0|This app is very easy to understand and use I have tried other apps before and had a harder time getting them to work the way this one does
B006MW3V6U|5.0|OMG, I am NOT a person who usually cares a whit about shows like this, but this series is brilliant to say the least.
B00DUGCLY4|4.0|It is a really good game but needs a skip button. That is the only thing that is bothering me because I cannot figure every single one out. Th
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|When I watch the show I am transported to a different time and place.  That is what a great show is all about.
B007PT1PEY|5.0|Never was a big fan of Sherlock Holmes until the BBC's Sherlock. Listening to Steven Moffat talk about how much he loved the character growing up and how the current series is based on the books, I decided to give them a try. I am in love. A nice long series of stories for me to read. Used to be a voracious reader, now, not so much. But still love reading; just more picky on my subjects and content. I think this will keep me occupied for a bit...... :)
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|Nice movie my four year old loved it as we'll as I did! The second one may have been better
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Who doesn't need a calculator at their fingertips a all times.  I don't have to pick up my cell phone or keep track of my calculator.
B008IYR2BA|5.0|Excellent show. Somewhat unpredictable, which is good for the viewer who likes psychological challenges. The premise of the show is quite interesting and as it unravels, it becomes moreso.
B0050PYNP8|5.0|I heard a lot about this movie its really funny everything I heard and more for the price can't beat it
B009HNDSL4|5.0|As with all other purchases from Amazon Instant Video it streams perfectly with my Roku 3. I purchased HD version & it also provides 5.1DD and if I download episodes to my TiVo Premiere it will play in 1080p with 5.1DD.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|better than temple run and I would recamend more bosses when gameloft.makes a uptate I would say also to put in more locations to go
B00CKJTOHO|5.0|Some twists and turns, that were unexpected this season, make this show even more enticing than past seasons. Definitely not for children or teens to watch. It is an adults-only show.
B00992CF6W|5.0|If you have to get all the versions of it the best one is Pocket Edition because it's the full version and its TOTLY AWSOME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is so fun. You first start in Paris then in 4 weeks u go to Beijing. Have fun playing around the world subway surfers
B003VANOFY|5.0|I was torn between these and the Corsair Vengeance 2000.  I have other Corsair hardware that I love, so I decided to go with the Corsair set first.  After two days of headaches and trouble, I returned them and got the Logitechs.  These performed perfectly out of the box, have great sound (although in regular stereo sound, the Corsairs had fuller sound, probably due to the 50mm drivers).  Plenty of options to customize your headset's function and sound.  Enough range for me to wear anywhere in my house.  Couldn't be more pleased.  Logitech knocked this one out of the park.
B0069GRIHW|5.0|I already had the best known of this band's big hits and bought it for those songs that are not as well known.  If you like the Doors this is a good collection to buy.
B00C2VIA52|5.0|This is NOT the typical genre of game that I enjoy, but I was very pleasantly surprised to find that I really love this game.<br /><br />It's surprisingly easy to learn, which adds to the appeal. Add to that the fact that you do NOT have to spend real money in order to enjoy and advance in the game.<br /><br />This one earns many highest possible recommendation.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is so addictive and fun. I would recommend this to any one who is okay spending most of their free time playing it. And also every body else. This game is a must have.
B00BIR381W|4.0|I bought this for my girlfriend, who is utterly obsessed with this TV series. I got it within the same week as I paid for it, just in time to wrap it and give it to her as a gift! Not too shabby on the price either.
1401311091|5.0|I collect books faster than I can read them so have not finished this one.  I LOVE the TV program Castle and this book reads just like the show.  My husband told me that Castle is a move in a chess game and Rook is a player that makes Castle-ing in the game possible so the cleverness is there.  Nathan Fillion's photo is on the back of the book but I'm willing to bet that the folks who write the show are really writing the books.  This one grabs your attention in the very first sentences and I have no doubt that I will not change my opinion by the end.  In fact, I just put the rest of the Nikki Heat books in my shopping cart.
B00BLF9FOK|4.0|another Arnold Movie with Action with a pretty good plot. Enjoy the Movie, and have Plenty of Pop corn!! He's BACK!!!!!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love it it is so cool you can get a chance for 100000000 coins and you can also use huverboards
B005OCFGTO|5.0|Wow, I never thought you'd be able to get 8 DVD's in a complete and sturdy package, for under $50! Very impressed by the price and shipping, got it within the same week as placing my order, just in time for movie night with the girlfriend!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|So revealing.  Very dramatic.  Everything comes neatly together and we have more of an understanding why  Christian is the way he is.<br /><br />I want another book.  The tease at the end from Christian's perspective left me wanting more!
B002SHD9E2|5.0|I have seen the Phantom in Las Vegas and this movie version is awesome!!! Really liked Mascarade scene and the voices are fantastic.
B00ATDOVNK|4.0|This is a game that has mystery and puzzles. Very easy to follow. Besides the random bodies and things popping out at you I love it. It really gets you to think about what's your next move.
B003UBTX6S|5.0|I loved reading this series :-) I was hooked. I love the imagination, and the places you went in the stories.
B00DJFIMW6|3.0|its ok it go's slow everything costs too much freezes up kindle and needs more power ups and more people and less minions
B00DIFARQ6|4.0|I have played this game several times and it does, nice! I would say &quot;GREAT&quot;, but they're some bugs to work on.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Difficult but fun. Really needs a help section. Would really enjoy more levels. Hope to see them really soon. Please.
B005ZMUXDC|5.0|This is a great family friendly movie full of adventure and a heartwarming story.  I would definitely recommend buying this movie because it is a modern take on a classic and is entertaining for all ages!  My husband also enjoyed it as much as I did!!
0385366752|4.0|Well written character development of two Gen Xers who really deserve each other. If this family lives next door to you, move.  Today.
B009DCOU9S|5.0|I've played many games with the basis as this game and this game, by far, is the best one I have ever played! Great job to the designer's!!!!!
B00E8B1P9M|5.0|Definitely worth renting! Comparable to Jar Heads.  Anyone 13 and up would enjoy it.<br />No wonder it made so much at the box office.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This has been the best book series I have ever read. I would recommend this book to anyone I know
B000Q6GUW0|5.0|I love love love this show! Super addicting and fast-paced with a great storyline and lots of twists and turns. Not for the faint of heart, though.
B00A3NQNUU|4.0|I like this game.  I do have some issues with it but overall it is a fun way to pass the time.<br /><br />My likes include all the different types of dragons and luck of the draw, being able to collect all types of items through colliseum play, etc.  Lots of variety throughtout game play.<br /><br />My dislike about this game is that i do not have facebook and was not able to save this game.  I was on a certain level and had even obtained the Kairos dragon.  Oh he was awesome!!!!!!  Next time i checked my game, everything i had done was lost and the game crashed.  Since then, i have not been successful in reloading the game on multiple occasions.  I am disappointed with that but i at least have it on my cell as a differtent game entirely.<br /><br />Please add google+ to server!!!!  I dont like facebook and refuse to use it.<br /><br />Other than that, i really enjoyed playing the game.  Very entertaining and have not been able to find anything like it!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love this game it's better than temple run and subway surfers combined you can run in different areas and in grus house but I think<br />The stuff at the shop is way to over priced other than that great game
B008HJGPVO|4.0|It is a great tool. I like the options, but wish there was one a little finer and more firm. The Fire responds too well! Still,  I am very glad to have it.
B0030B624E|5.0|I absolutely love this movie. I've made tons of people watch it, and they've all loved it as well. All the actors do a great job, and I can watch this again and again without getting tired of it. I strongly recommend it!
B009NQZVKG|5.0|I'm a big fan of Rollins' Sigma Force Books, and this new one is just as exciting as the others. We find out more about some familiar characters and meet a few new ones, with some surprising plot developments! It's always fun to see what new and overwhelming disaster to the world the team will face and how they will solve it all by the end of the book. If only we really had such talented people solving all the actual threats to our world!
B00DP3IGJ6|4.0|I was expecting what passes for a typical, modern, post-apocalyptic, big-budget sci-fi movie with Oblivion: a movie that was more suited to a bargain bin, just a hair above a 'b' sci-fi channel flick; and maybe not even that.  Loaded with trite messages about how bad humans are or how we screwed up the planet or some other tired overdone plot with all the distracting special effects the creators could junk into the frame at a time.  Instead I found myself really enjoying this movie.  It had very well done special effects that felt real and added to the story instead of becoming the focal point themselves.  The actors did a decent job, and the plot was familiar yet had some unique elements that kept it very entertaining and even gave it re-watch-ability.  I think it has wide appeal, especially to lovers of the genera.
B000GWE44U|5.0|Title says it all. Can't get over so many years have passed since the<br />release of this movie. I may have enjoyed the story more today than I did the<br />first time, which for me was all about the special effects and fright they elicited.
B008AUGEFC|5.0|The twists and turns in this novel rose above and beyond my expectations I just adore this story have already read it twice and just can't put it down
B003ZSJ212|5.0|The product was as described. Some signs of wear around the case that don't bother me.<br />Great conditions in the interior.
B00D7JGL36|5.0|The Derailers,Dwight Yoakam and now Vince Gill showing there respects too the Bakersfield sound.Between Vince Gill and Paul Franklin you can hear the respect and honor that these songs and their originators deserve.Congrats to both of these musicians on this album the only bad thing is that ther are only ten songs come on guys you have teased the fans of the Bakersfield sound now we need more .
B000VSAEYI|5.0|This is a great product -- big enough for 3 toddlers. My 2.5 year old twin girls love the slide, it keeps them entertained for hours. It takes a while to inflate but i guess that's pretty normal for a pool as large as this one.
B00CWV8TIU|3.0|Not enough character development and/ or plot twists for the high caliber billing. Great acting all around. Good enough story but could have been developed more.
B007SGM084|5.0|I bought these because everyone at work kept talking about them. I borrowed the books but just wanted to have my own copies so that i can read again and again. Well worth it. Some material in the books might not be for everyone, but I'm open minded. I think it is a very romantic story.
B007HO392S|5.0|This is Carrie with a totally different image. But &#34;Blown Away&#34; shows that Carrie knows how to express her message via. the songs she picks and sings in a way only she can do. Tx. Amazon.
B009HQ9UHC|3.0|I know it's not Angry Birds, but I wanted some elements of it at least. I don't hate this game, but I'm glad it was free. The graphics are good, it's from the makers of the original AB so it better be good, but I didn't feel it. You know the excitement of destruction and mayhem? Overall, I play this game every once in a while, but it's not my go-to game when I'm bored.
B0042TV4IW|5.0|These are great character stories set in a classic era. If you like Downtown Abbey, you will probably enjoy these.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is very fun to play an very addicting. A must have if you like the movie. I really love playing this game!!!
B007PKSN6Q|5.0|Loved it! My favorite music. THE VOCALISTS WERE ACTUALLY GOOD!<br />Music of this era was the greatest. Would recommend this cd if you
B00785P2QC|4.0|The is a great city building game. You build your city up from scratch. Its hard to get money, just the challenge I want.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|I love this game.my mommy gets up at 5am amd I still be playing the game. It gets me in trouble. I'm 7 but I still love it
B009CF7JDU|5.0|As good today as it was in theaters. Just a simple fun clean skip school flick. My 13 year old loved it.
B000001FMC|5.0|I love this group's sound and couldn't resist buying it here on Amazon. I use to borrow a relatives and decided to buy my own copy. Thanks.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is truly my favorite right now the graphics are great and you just have a great time and it makes you feel like your inside the game it's basically like temple run but a bit better because of the details so basically if your a fan of the movie it's a must have and great for all ages
B0055G9L9U|5.0|Paul is quite hilarious in spite of some foul language that somehow fits into this movie.  A great character in a middle aged alien who was hidden for years in Area 51.  A Happy Ending.
B0002SROSQ|5.0|A lot of other reviewers here on Amazon have listed a track by track break down and I read their notes before buying this album.  I mostly agree with what the others have already said.  I find that the reviews here are so much more reliable and informative than anything the ''professional critics' have to say!!  Maybe because we actually pay for the items and are real fans.  Anyway, for me Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds can do no wrong.  It doesn't matter whether I'm listening to the 'Dig Lazarus Dig' end of the Bad Seeds spectrum or the 'No More Shall We Part' end, for lack of a better description.  I love it all! I was thrilled with this album and feel that it has a little something for everyone!
159463176X|2.0|I loved The Kite Runner and A Thousand Splendid Suns and was anxious to read the newest offering. The beginning was beautifully written, but then there was too much jumping around to characters who had very little to do with the main story.  He tried to weave a larger story out of many shorter stories from different perspectives, but the execution of this idea fell flat.  For pages and pages into each new chapter, the reader is left wondering who these new characters are, in what time frame is the action taking place, and how these characters contribute to the main narrative.  Unfortunately, many of the very long rabbit trails have such a minor ties to the main characters.  I did something I have never done before and stopped reading about halfway through and just skimmed the last chapter.  Then I tried to go back and skim some of the skipped chapters, but I just didn't care about those characters because they really didn't matter.  If you have not read Hosseini's first 2 books, do yourself a favor and read them instead.  He is a master storyteller, just not in this book.
B005PWPUW6|4.0|I am a DAC novice. I bought this product because the price was right and the reviews were good. I use it with my desktop Mac and desktop speakers. BUT what I didn't realize is that this product does not have a volume control. And the volume controls on the Mac keyboard are disabled because that's what happens when you use an external DAC. There is a volume knob on the back on one of my speakers (Audioengine) and that's how I control it. It's a bit of a pain. But the sound is good
B002RI9O9G|4.0|Kind of a simple story but still a bit of a fairy tale. The main character Eilis doesn't come across as remarkable so she's easy to identify with and yet her life ends up being pretty exciting, compared with what she starts off with. I'd recommend it as a good companion to anyone making a new start away from home.
B00DU74U74|4.0|I had reservations about watching this movie, but I enjoyed it. So, I would recommend it for others to see.
B00AKOB7CG|4.0|It provided these workouts:<br />- Ab<br />- Arm<br />- Butt<br />- Cardio<br />- Leg<br />- Full ( All of the ones listed above together )<br /><br />And once you selected a workout it gave you these choices:<br />Select Workout Length   10 min 20 min 30 min<br />Select Workout Routine   ( I'm guessing here)  Upper Body, Lower Body, Middle Part ( Belly? ) and Settings
B008Y7N7JW|3.0|Good movie - held my interest but a bit disjointed at times.  I'm not sure where the creatures came from - holograms, genetic engineering, whatever...a bit too magical.  I'd love to live in a society where they have medicines which can apparently heal extreme wounds overnight but they entertain themselves in such a barbaric fashion.  That didn't bother me though.  I enjoyed it overall and just questioned afterwards.  I would give it 3 and 1/2 stars but I didn't know how to give &#34;1/2&#34;.
B00D23GXB2|5.0|I loved the Greatest Poet Alive's latest release.  Sensual, Sexual and erotic are just a few of the words that I'd use to describe his prose. Each poem release electric hues that strum through the atmosphere. His poems are electric, palpable and create the feeling of being in the room. I look forward to reading more of his works. Ladies let me give you a little tip, go to you tube and look at one of his readings before you read the book. I will let you in on a secret, you'll be able to hear his voice in your head as you read. Enjoy!!
B004G600A4|5.0|This has got to be the BEST DIsney movie in a long, long, long time. I adore all of the characters, all of the songs, and the story line. The story is incredibly well developed. Everyone in my family enjoys this movie - that includes a toddler, a teenager, and two adults over the age of 30.  This is worth owning. I bought a standard DVD and it looks and plays great. We do have a BluRay player - but I must admit - I can't really tell much of a difference between the two. The quality of this movie/product is just amazing.
B00B7Y0206|2.0|First off, when you open the app up, it shows you a mini tutorial. Then once you're done reading it, it brings you to a new .. page thing ( Still in the app ) and you paste the YouTube link where it says &#34;Paste YouTube Link Here&#34;, and once you do, you press the button right below it where it says &#34;Go!&#34;. Then it brings up a &#34;General App tutorial&#34; That just sorta introduces you. It gives you many options on how you want to download it that I find very confusing and no  matter which one I chose it didn't work :/
B009DCOU9S|5.0|A great combination of search and find and puzzles. The story/mystery is nicely done. The graphics are terrific and the occasional help is appreciated !
B0092SQ5EG|3.0|It was okay for a documentary.  Seemed pretty honest.  Might be more entertaining as a movie.  It is as I expected.
B008AK8FHM|3.0|I expected more. It was interesting. It was good. 75% of it is story and the last 25% is random yet related information about the story. The story of the &#34;afterlife&#34; seemed to be lacking more detail. But the overall book was interesting enough to read.
B000FC12SM|5.0|A good comparison between the two sexes and how they differ and have to live with one another.  The difference between the left brain in men and both sides in woman and how they work.
B00352TZCE|4.0|Got to love it when you think you are going to watch yet &#34;another one of THOSE movies&#34;, and bam...you get looped sideways! Great movie..especially on a boring night..Kate Beckinsale does a great job in trying to figure out which one and who before time runs out. Great cast of actors/actresses too. Worth watching.
B00B2V66VS|2.0|Deleted it.  Too many interruptions asking for purchases.  Cute presentation though.  Grandson didn't like it.  Will try it when he gets older.  This is more a try-out because it constantly interrupts you.
B009DCOU9S|2.0|could not even get the first item which is a box of letters.  impossible to find.  Tried every item over and over again.  Where the heck is it?  Hate to give up so soon.  Any help please?
B009XIXVU6|3.0|Given that the first two books were easy to follow with more intense details, this book seemed to be missing more to the story of the main characters. It was a good read but I was expecting more.
B004UPANGM|5.0|Haven't seen this in years..and I forgot how the one liners and antics will get you. Not a horror film(unless you are easily scared) , but more a tongue in cheek sort of movie. Grab your popcorn, drink, and sit back ready to laugh your rear off.!!
B008602KQI|4.0|I was shocked to find myself glued to the movie almost upon the moment that it started. It never looked as interesting to me as all the hype about it insinuated it was. I was wrong. The books are now on my to read list, which I'm sure are better than the movie (but books almost always are, right?) I found the characters interesting, and the story line was more gripping than I expected it to be. I would have liked more history about this post uprising dictatorship they appear to be living in, but you can only put so much in a movie. One thing is for sure, I can't wait for the next installment.
B004ZZS4CC|4.0|this is a sad book told from an uplifting point of view. I wish Jaycee is able to live a full and happy life even though her childhood has been stolen. Best wishes young lady. You have done an outstanding job surviving and raising your girls. Bless you.
6305696071|5.0|Movie that sparked a generation of Cinderella-esq movies
B005GSZZ1A|5.0|This is an amazing story about a man who escaped camp 14 and north korea. It is a must read if you want to learn about north korea and the horrifying camps inside
B00C7JGDBW|5.0|Kids loved this movie.  I really liked getting the Digital copy along with the actual DVD so the kids could download to their Kindles to watch when they wanted, but also to have the DVD to watch as a family.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|my son and I love to play this. it's very addictive and we laugh at the antics of goofy minions.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Please hurry and create more rooms. My kids can't wait.  My seven and nine year old kids were working together trying to figure out each room.
1476712042|5.0|You know how a book will be on your radar for a really long time, but then you wait forever to finally sit down and read it?  This was my case with Beautiful Disaster.  I kept hearing mixed reviews for it.  So I kept pushing it further and further back.  But then I had the opportunity to meet the author Jamie McGuire at BEA, and was able to pick up a copy of the companion book to Beautiful Disaster, Walking Disaster.  So I finally picked up Beautiful Disaster, and I loved it.<br /><br />This book is highly addictive.  Just as everyone says.  I was this close to calling out of work because I wanted to stay home and read it.  And while I was at work all I could think about was when my shift would be over so I could get home and read.  The story of Abby and Travis just captivated me.  I was sucked into their relationship, both the good parts and the bad parts.<br /><br />The main character is Abby Abernathy.  She is in her first year of college, and she is attempting to escape her past by going to college out of state with her cousin and best friend America.  America is dating a boy she met at Freshman orientation Sheply.  Sheply shares an apartment with Travis Maddox.  Travis is a bad boy.  He pretty much uses women for sex, and he makes his living fighting in underground fights at school.  Travis tries to charm Abby, and at first she doesn't fall for it.  But after losing a bet with Travis, they begin to become a lot closer, and Abby is finding it difficult to resist Travis.<br /><br />Abby and Travis are not role models.  At times their relationship is just unhealthy.  While I was reading Beautfiul Disaster I kept thinking, I hope young readers won't read this book because they'll get a bad example about what love is.  Travis isn't just a bad boy.  He has major psychiatric issues.  His behavior towards Abby at times borders between love and obsession.  But even with both Abby and Travis's issues, as a reader you can't help but want them to work out.  Because not everything about their relationship is bad.  And I think the author tries to show this.  I mean just look at the title of the book.  Abby and Travis are beautiful together, but at the same time they can be disastrous.<br /><br />The negativity and backlash this book has gotten is really unnecessary.  I get what the author is trying to convey.  It's not written for pre and young teens hence the college setting.  And it's realistic.  People get involved in unhealthy relationships everyday.  But it's how you deal with these relationships, and what you do to make them healthier.<br /><br />The end of Beautiful Disaster was pretty much the end.  I am glad that there isn't a sequel.  I don't like when authors write unnecessary sequels.  I feel that some authors do this to please their fans.  And as nice as that is, it can drag out the story.  When something is done, it is done.  However, I am excited to read Walking Disaster.  It is not a sequel.  It is Beautiful Disaster from Travis's point of view.  There were definitely quite a few scenes in which I was wondering what Travis was thinking, and why he did certain things.  I can't wait to find out these answers.<br /><br />Reviewed by Sana @ Step Into Fictionrything about their relationship is bad.  And I think the author tries to show this.

B00CDT41RY|5.0|Great film! Jamie Foxx's performance was awesome! Never a dull moment. The acting and story line were very impressive. Great movie!
B004HWYTP4|5.0|We just watched it and enjoyed the living heck out of it.  Looking forward to the next Red and stocking up on Popcorn.
B0036UMM84|4.0|I have wanted to see this movie again for a long time and hadn't been able to find it.  I had just read an aricle about Kris Kristofferson and went looking for this movie and one other that was a TV movie.  Found them both on Amazon of course!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love getting the highest score possible. it is a little addictive, but I can score 116423 with six multiplier.
B000BISBDY|5.0|The majority of Johnyy's big hits are on this CD.  I enjoy it so much, and recommend it to all his millions of fans.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|fun and entertaining. this app is way better than temple run and subway surfers especially because it is based on the movie too. hopefully they'll base it on the secound movie
055380684X|5.0|I was blown away and completely fascinated by this book!  It will alter your thinking about talent and no longer will you claim a person is successful due to luck.  Dive in, this book is excellent?
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|It's so addicting. Be prepared to spend a lot of time playing this because it's so much fun.  And the minions are adorable to boot.
B009NFHF0Q|2.0|I guess the best thing I can say is that this book was just a little too different for me.  For someone else, it may be right up their alley.  It just didn't work for me.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|at first I was afraid my favorite character Agnes would not be on there and you did awesome hard yet fun!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|A great game. A great way to pass the time. I especially love the way you can upgrade your power-ups. Very, very fun game.
B000SEIK2S|5.0|If your looking for action and adventure then this is the book for you. John Scalzi has done a great job of capturing space and space battles and still keeping a human story.
B0099Y2MYK|4.0|I don't think this season quite measured up to the other two seasons but it was enjoyable just the same.
B00ADQCBEY|4.0|The Macho police squad renders justice (unless they kill the wrong man).  The evidence they acquire won't stand up in court but who's going to court when the witness is dead!
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|This was a very very good book. It was thoughtful, nice, and had lots of bravery. I chose this rating because it was thoughtful, nice, and had lots of bravery in it. And that's just what our younger community need to read.
B001RCD2DW|3.0|I bought these about 4 months back and was very impressed.<br /><br />Yes, the bass is at a lower level compared to some heavy bass sets, but none of the bass is missing. They have an excellent reproduction of the entire range.<br /><br />My issue started though about 3-4 weeks after getting them when a rattle started in the right side at certain bass frequencies. This became worse and very noticeable, so I finally got around to having them replaced. (was away for a while before this, hence the delay).<br /><br />Just received my new headset, only to find it is now made in China. Basically any review that says they are from Austria is now outdated. My last set were Austrian made, and there is a difference in the quality.<br /><br />I will be honest, if you did not see them side by side you may not notice, but the detail has been lost (especially in the headband which is a major downgrade, even though it superficially looks the same)<br /><br />As for the sound...<br /><br />Well this too has suffered. Again, the Chinese made ones are still good by any standard, but they have lost their real edge. As I have the replacement from Amazon I can test them side by side.<br /><br />For me they are comfortable, sound great and are still an awesome pair of headphones. But they have gone downhill, which is a shame. And they are now made in China but still cost the same price.<br /><br />For me it is that tiny edge of difference between the Austrian and Chinese made sets that justify the price difference compared to other sets.<br /><br />All I can say is shame on you AKG.
B00D2K40WY|5.0|Yet another app that my 5 year old is enjoying!  I was afraid that she would not be able to understand how to play this since it is about &#34;grown up&#34; girls make-up.  She picked it right up and was soon giving the characters makeovers!
B0047Y17P2|5.0|I love Connelly's writing. His books always have plenty of meat, good character development and excellent plot progression. I like that there is usually a twist, and loves his ornery characters. Good job, Mike!

B008KP6ENE|2.0|I find some of the Amazon games for my phone just don't download.  Maybe I am just not tech savy enough, but they don't show under apps or downloads, even tho Amazon said it did.  I didn't get this one; glad it was free.
B0063M22QO|4.0|Great game to play alone.<br />I play this when I have time to kill. It lets you ponder what play to make
B0064W65UM|5.0|I'm a huge fan of the movie and finally decided to read the comic. I'm sad to say that this is my first comic but I've always loved comic based movies. After reading this I'm definitely looking forward to reading more graphic novels.

B006GWO5NE|5.0|I am always losing the one that came with my kindle, so having an extra is wonderful, and being 5ft long is great.  I now keep one cord plugged in by my bed and one by my chair.
0062255657|4.0|The first 80-90% of this book are amazing, the last 10-20% fell a little flat, kind of a lackluster ending. But I really like the time period and the setting and the language. Definitely worth a read.
B002N5N5QQ|5.0|What can I say its Sons of Anarchy! Greatest show ever.  Season Two was even better than I expected. Great Season. A must purchase.
B0080SZ0V8|5.0|This game provides continuous enjoyment!  I love a game that stimulates the brain and Azada does just that. I recommend it to anyone who likes a little challenge!

B001O9BB3G|3.0|Good book, went more in depth when it came to describing the different thoughts and relationships, but the movie was better

0060594896|5.0|I didn't I hear about this stuff sooner?  I share all of this important information with ALL of my students....:)
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Wonderful graphics and a good level of difficulty. I am looking forward to the next installment with much anticipation.<br />I recommend this game to anyone who enjoyed the Myst games!
B0094KF4WG|5.0|No Easy Day is an enthralling read about was it is to be a Navy SEAL engaged in covert operations to conduct rescue missions and take-out the bad guys. This first hand account of the mission to kill Osama Bin Laden is written with such clarity that the entire mission, from the infiltration of Bin Laden's compound in Abbotabad to the mission extraction - unfold before the reader in such a way as to make you believe you are there as an active participant. An enjoyable read that certainly heightened my respect for the dangerous work that the US Navy SEALS (and other special forces units around the world) do to make our world a safer place to live in - work that is more often than not unrecognised or acknowledged.
B003G4W49C|5.0|I have always loved this book. I've been re-reading it since I was in 7th grade and it only get better. I cannot wait for the movie to finally come out!!!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|warning you should not get this game if you don't like addiction to games, fluffy unicorns, despicable me the movie, and especially BANAANAAAAS ! if you don't like any of these things, how can you live with yourself?
0756697875|3.0|Item was listed as like new but there was some damage along the binding. My son absolutely loves the book. But the condition was not like new.
0345803507|5.0|For a time I thought these books were nothing more than a pleasureful read, however my fiancée convinced me to read them... Best choice ever, the trilogy is not only a pleasureful read, but the entangling story or miss Steele is worth the read, take it from a man who never reads books, once I started I stopped only when I needed sleep, these books are a must read!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|These are kind of silly little games but the kids love them and they are great to pass the time away when you're bored but don't have time to get into a longer game.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|its amazing I play it all the time everyone trys to get my attention but I'm so in the zone playing it.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|I was really skeptical about this book but hey since it was free I tried it and man what a surprise. great chemistry between the male and female characters.
B0067R0APK|5.0|Easy convenient I love the news and videos on the application.I am sure that you will enjoy the maps and daily forecast sections as well.
0753541637|5.0|This book reveals some of the barriers created by both society and ourselves limit women in reaching their fullest potential. Although this book is written for women, the ideas in this book should be known by everyone - no matter what path your life is following.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Excellent book, but I've come to expect that of Khaled Hosseini.  The story was heart wrenching and made me feel for the characters, as well as think about the situation in the Middle East.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|I am hooked on this series.  Watch the entire season at once.  Can hardly wait for season  4 to watch it.
B00AB7HESI|5.0|This game what you should spend your money on its so amazing you can write something then it comes true.

B000SCHC0Q|5.0|Excellent book, but I've come to expect that of Khaled Hosseini.  The story was heart wrenching and made me feel for the characters, as well as think about the situation in the Middle East.
B005Q1W10A|5.0|I watched the entire season in one setting .  I planned on watching one episode a day but that didn't happen.  Great show
B003WUYRGI|1.0|You need to use a real dictionary not some cheap old Oxford dictionary.you can bring more value ok to u
0979019710|5.0|I've listened to or read several self help books and audio programs, but never to one that seemed so reasonable and significant. It's so easy to wake up knowing that you are about to spend some intensely valuable \\"Me time\\" that is going to practically force you to become a better person. I intend on taking full advantage of anything Hal makes available to me.
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|I recommend this book to everyone who will listen.  I loved it, quite simply.  It could have gone on 400 more pages and I would have still felt it wasn't long enough.
B00A83075M|5.0|I totally loved this movie!!! I don't know what the creators smoked to be able to do such an amazing work and imagine all those different worlds showed in the movie, but keep smoking it!!!
B00E66QPCG|5.0|This eBook is a step by step guide for the \\"Simple Strategy\\", but also the foundation for ANY solid strategy that a trader would want to consider. Kudos to the author for sharing a well rounded and thought out trading method. In the eBook Markus encourage traders to begin focusing on signals that produce a 50% winning percentage and then go from there. Although some traders might be discouraged by a 50% winning percentage, I think this is very realistic based on what I'm seeing, which isn't bad for just starting.<br /><br />PROS: Dozens of charts with clear entry and exit rules. I also like the idea of volatility exits that adjust to different market conditions.<br />CONS: At first I was a little concerned about how to enter since range bars were a new concept to me, but there is a chapter on using time bars as an alternative and after I looked at some range bar charts I now understand the idea of \\"anticipating\\" a signal using range bars.<br /><br />I do feel better about trading trends after reading this book, but now I just need some more experience and practice with the strategy. My focus is on futures but it looks like the rules for Forex are the same and I like that the strategy can be traded in different markets.
B009AMANBA|5.0|Lincoln is a gift for my husband for his birthday and I know he has wanted to watch the movie.  The book, To Kill A Mockingbird, is also, a gift for him and he has never read it but, has seen the movie. Ceremonies is another gift for him along with the movie Moneyball.  Sorry that I am doing this all on one submission but, I have nerve damage in my elbows and typing is painful.  Thanks again Amazon!!
B00BWJARHO|1.0|As a lifelong fan of the book I was so disappointed.  Took far too many liberties, the wrong characters said some of the most classic lines, things that are key in the book were cut while extras were added that killed the pacing.  So sad to see such a great book turned into this.  Completly lost the spirit of the book.
B0099RFVXQ|5.0|I bought this movie to watch on the plane to Las Vegas. My husband watched it on our iPad. It made the time go faster on the plane. The movie is action packed and we love the cast of super heros.
B00B2TUKI0|5.0|Madeline has a haunting, beautiful voice..I could listen to her all day..and do at times!<br />I like her music first thing in the morning, all thru my day, and late in the evening as well..Beautiful!
B00ABLJ5NQ|4.0|Wow.  This is the first book I've read by this author.  Neil has some serious skills.<br />This story is about something amazing that happens in a man's childhood.  What happens hits so close to home that I cried, and I don't cry easily.<br />I gave it one less star because I don't see myself reading it again.<br />It showed a fresh angle on life, death and eternity.  Definitely give it a try.
B00BD62X14|5.0|This was my first CD by  Carla Bruni..I first heard her on the today Show..and immediately went to Amazon to find her CD'S..another gorgeous voice..and I love it and play it all day, will definitely buy more of her CD'S as they become available!
B005CRY2O6|5.0|Unusual but simple recipes, perfectly inspired. The flavor combinations are unique but unforgettable once you try them. I've made nearly every recipe with great results.
B005GSZZ1A|5.0|I, like many Americans have been totally ignorant of what goes on there even though I was privilege enough  to go<br />to the DMZ (one of the scariest places I have ever been). I could not put this book down and could not believe what<br />this person had endured and is still enduring because of his treatment in NK, to have that kind of fortitude puts the<br />rest of us to shame.
0783229364|5.0|I like Michael J. Fox so this is a very good movie for me. I've already watched it and it is very funny.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I used to be a Stephen King fanatic back in the day, but I got a little burned out and hadn't read anything of his in probably 20 years.  But I was looking for something to read on a recent trip, and this had such good reviews that I decided to buy it.  Boy, was that money well spent!  I absolutely loved it, and even though it's very long, I never got bored and was a little sad when it was over.  I learned a lot of details that I didn't know previously about JFK's assassination, and the fictional story line that King created around it was clever and original.  FYI, this book wasn't scary at all, so if King's other books are too horrifying for you, don't let that stop you from reading this one.
B0069G5Z9K|4.0|This is really a great game awesome time passer...but it would be nice if other were up dates for it. Pleas come out with some.
B00BU18U82|4.0|its a great game with farming. it cost money to buy the real equipment and I don't mind that but can you add some case or John deer or any kind of equpiment. and make it so you can have more equipment. my friennds think so too.  this message is for (17) people.
B00D2K40WY|5.0|Awesome game it's really not that hard but it's fun . Me and my sister both downloaded it and loved it.
B00B8R1NP0|5.0|This book is not for the queasy, as murder details are graphically spelled out. Having said that, the book IS for lovers of mysteries and thrillers, because author Todd M. Thiede has written a very compelling novel. Set in quiet, smalltown Rockton, Illinois, it begins at 2 a.m. with a man named Stephen Bjornson waking up to find he's tied to his bed and duct-taped. He looks at his wife Gwen and sees she has suffered the same fate. He feels groggy and drugged but eventually sees a man standing at the foot of their bed. The man is berating Stephen for wasting his time. He places a price on that waste - $633. The killer gets the money from Stephen and even returns change to the man who will eventually be his only conscious victim. Thus begins a very violent and bizarre scenario that ends with three murders and Stephen Bjornson wishing he were dead. It's the start of a series of similar murders that leave the small town reeling.<br />Enter Detective Max Larkin, apparently the best cop on the force. He's assigned to the case and also to a new partner - he hates it, and she's a woman at that! Jesse Fairlane is new on the job and impressed with Max. Together they will attempt to solve not only this crime but others that unfold. This includes similar cases dating back 25 years ago, and then another from 10 years ago. Could they possibly be related? They share similar brutalities and a special message left in the blood of the victims, to the effect of \\"Don't Waste People's Time.\\"<br />With few clues to go on, the two detectives work to not only solve the cases but prevent other innocent people from being murdered, just because they kept someone waiting, wasting his time. The book is the first in a Max Larkin series and readers will be glad of it. It's a very satisfying, fast-paced read.
B008AK8FHM|3.0|I truly enjoyed this book.  Very interesting and captivating, but I felt he was repetitive in his description of his NDE and of his illness.  Not as much of his after life as I was expecting.  But I do believe what he experienced was real and his recovery was a miracle from God.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is the best I love the fluffy unicorn It is the bomb. I'm saving up for the baby. I showed the game to my sister and at first she said it was dumb but then she played it and loved it.
B009DCOU9S|4.0|Fun game but too much talking. You should be able to turn off<br />The talking once not every screen. Otherwise nice game.
B0000C9ZBW|5.0|I wanted a watch with no fuzz ...<br />No date, no secondhand  - just a elegant timepiece.<br />This is iot!
B003A03RRU|5.0|Great reading a clear and enjoyable to have all of the works Of Arthur Conan Doyle all together. I think I'll try a few more old classics
0399534601|5.0|The book has a very beautiful visual graphics. It is light and deep. I'm sure it is a new way to see life. Good for teaching kids and for adults to learn. Marvelous book. Very interesting. A way of life!
B0087GF8ZG|4.0|This is a great item, works as described. It has a great light and the only thing is that the light on only lasts 5 seconds and then it goes off. It will be amazing if you could select how much time it remains on.
B002ZM74Y6|3.0|A RATHER GOOD PICTURE OF THE Mafia with a good twist on trying to put two lives-thet of mafiosi and husband-with their conflicts and disasters.I felt the narrative just stopped rather than concluded.
B00AB0Z88S|5.0|I bought this DVD for a friend with a 3D TV.  The 3D effects were amazing!  The movie itself was also very good.
B00BFUUMO8|1.0|Not good u have to buy stuff to play it. This ap is free but every time my son played it it need something for the dinosaur thst u have to buy.
B00E9HML1Q|1.0|You must be kidding. 30 dollars more for the figurine?<br />I really wish the cover to be better ...for eg the edition with<br />the lego bilbo has a wonderful cover to its disc case.
B002VPE1WK|3.0|This pack must be made for teens. It is so small that I had to let the straps all the way out just to get the waist strap below my chest??? The cross strap would not attach low enough to go under my neck. The bag would be okay for a very small dslr and a couple of small lenses, but that is it. I can't use it. I sent it back with no problem. That is why I use Amazon.com, they always take care of me. Thanks Amazon!
B00CATSONE|5.0|This book is short, but it is worth reading many other books and articles. It is that clear, simple and direct. Or you could just say the author uses pages very efficiently to deliver useful and interesting concepts in a very clear manner.<br />If you are interested on the theory of multiple intelligences, and the influence of creativity and imagination on human potential to achieve extraordinary things, this book will be a great investment of your time (and you will not invest that much time). The life of Tesla is mostly used as an interesting example that will make clear many fascinating concepts about geniality.
B000FC1HBY|5.0|This book is SO BAD ASS! I'm a really slow reader, so the fact that I finished this book up in less than two weeks says a lot of about how good of a read this was.
B0094BB4TW|1.0|Never refreshes and is always behind.  I have tried deleting it and reinstalling it and it works for about 24 hours and then stops again.  I get so frustrated with it!
B009XIXVU6|5.0|I thought that the writer told a most interesting story about unusual people, and each had their own full story
B005SEKMH4|5.0|I experienced two near burn-outs, then my brother recommended Spark. After reading the book I started excercising every morning at 06:00, 30 minutes on hometrainer pushing up my hartrate. The results are amazing, no stress experience anymore, enjoying life as never before and a brainfunction that I never experienced in my whole life.<br />It's an open door, everbody knows it, but you have to do it!
B009DCOU9S|3.0|The game is simplistic, perfect escape game. But there is a glitch on level 8 that has made it impossible<br />To go on. Won't let me pick up the blue flower from behind the rock on the left.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|defending jacob started a little slow, but became more interesting as the novel progressed.  this was a book about a typical<br />disfunctional family but progresses into a lot more.  I enjoyed it and would recommend it to anyone who likes to read books with<br />twists and turns and ends with the readers perception as a conclusion.
B0046B3QTG|5.0|Love this movie!!!!!  Love this movie!!!!! Can't wait to see the 2nd despicable me.were older and still love this movie.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This is an awesome game. So excited we got the update. I love the el macho levels. Everything about this game is so much fun.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I like the way this game offers you the option to deal one at a time, or three at a time.
B00DEG4Z1W|1.0|The game was not fun at all it was hard to do her hair and I don't like it. I got this my daughter and she said why did you get it and also I had to pay 9$ to get an upgrade and you get tricked they say it is only .99 cents but it was not I hope no one gets this app.

B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Everything I have needed in a calculator for my kindle.  Big easy simple graphically.  I am an accountant and have been satisfied with app purchase.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I bought this game for my Grandsons on my Kindle Fire.  They LOVE it and now I can't seem to ever get my Kindle back because they are always playing Minecraft on it!  Keeps them busy for hours.  I sure miss my Kindle!
B00E8G5HDW|5.0|This is without a doubt the best season of The Clone Wars series. It's great come back from a rather disappointing season 4 and is pact with action and excitement. The stunning animation, sincere performances, and solid stories will captivate audiences of all ages. Among other things, season 5 shows just how physically, mentally, and emotionally strong Ahsoka is, which was a joy to watch. Experiencing the unique friendship between characters and their journey throughout the series is a wonderful reminder of why audiences are so captivated by Clone Wars. Congratulations are in order to the cast and crew of Star Wars: The Clone Wars!
B004R6JG7Q|3.0|Remember the car chase in Bullitt?  Of course, anyone who has ever seen that movie can picture it in their minds, no matter how long it's been since you last saw it.  Remember the movie's plot?  Apart from the chase scene, it was a completely unmemorable film, with a weak plot of sorts that kinda drifted into a few minutes of edge-of-the-seat excitement, then faded off into the end (which looked like they just got tired of it so they quit and called it good.)<br /><br />That's this movie.  The driving is good.  There are two crashes of note that happen within a minute or so of each other.  That covers the high points. Plot?  Nothing to speak of.  Dialog?  Some of the foreign drivers' accents are so good you can't figure out what they're saying, but it probably doesn't matter anyway.  I watched it a few days ago, but I'd have to go back and look at the case notes to find out what this was about.  It's just not worth it to me to walk over to the living room to remind myself.<br /><br />Steve McQueen was offered the lead in the 1966 film &#34;Grand Prix&#34;, but the guy who delivered the offer rubbed Steve the wrong way, so he turned it down.  Bad choice!!  James Garner took the role and that turned out to be one of the greatest racing movies ever made.  McQueen decided to make &#34;Le Mans&#34; as a way to get back at them for doing it so well without him.  There are better reasons, like maybe you have rights to a story that needs to be told?  This wasn't the one.  It only looks worse by contrast.<br /><br />Pass on this one, get &#34;Grand Prix&#34;, and you'll never regret it!!
B00D41AJ7G|5.0|This game was so worth it!  I was hooked in the first round, and completed the game in one day because I couldn't put it down.  I really enjoyed it, I think you will too!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Awesome  great super duper awesome game best game on my kindle in my opinion. Overall just a great good little game that is really fun.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|After several months of debilitating tinnitus I finally saw a hearing aid specialist. He tested me and found the specific megahertz range that my brain waves were not getting due to my hearing loss.  He recommended listening to music such as lower registered flutes, piano, sax, etc.  I put on one earbud on and use certain relaxing sounds in that range and my brain like it, so it creates less phantom noise.  The tinnitus will never go away, but this app helps tremendously in lessening the intensity of the phantom noise.
B0043HA1K0|5.0|This is a great album. However, it's made available for free (legal) download by the artists themselves as the \\"Wake Up! Radio\\" J.Period mixtape on various websites. Knowledge is power!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|this is awesome and rad it is like sooooooo fun bro its like a fun machine I am addicted to it homie
B006FO3ERQ|3.0|Dell Parsons, now sixty-five years of age, relates his life's passage at age fifteen, in the year 1960.  Looking back fifty years can be no simple matter for anyone, and I suspect Dell qualifies as such; his clear and concise descriptions of places (inside and out) and people is remarkable.  The first few sentences tell of his parents robbing a bank and to follow, a couple of murders.  And now, the story unfolds - from Montana to CANADA.  The bank heist occurs and Bev and Neeva Parsons return home, Bev (the father) satisfied with the ease of the job.  But alas, this new career is short lived and prison is in the immediate future.  But then, it is the failure of the city, the county, whereby the two teenage children are somehow neglected and left on their own.  Really Dell, did it happen this way?  You and sister Berner visit your parents in jail, and no one inquiries as to the presence of a guardian, an adult.  Montana appears to be getting a bad rap, here.  Let's move forward:  Charley Quarters, a lipstick and mascara wearing soul, with hands that wander too freely.  Dell also says he makes every effort to keep distance  between Charley and himself.  Sorry Dell, you again leave me with some doubt; when you describe Charley, pervert, pedophile come to mind.  Is it a possibility that the unthinkable was unavoidable; come, Dell, get this weight off your chest.  Be a man.  If he molested you, confess it.  Don't just leave it out there; after all, you were but a boy at the time.  As to the murders and Arthur Remlinger, your supposed benefactor.  This reads like some dime novel; it happens, but senseless, yes; tragically unnecessary, yes.  You, Dell, are an innocent witness to the killings (why you are dragged into this event is beyond reason) and then an hesitant accomplice.  No RCMP to check the scene, no dastardly deed to be investigated; and so, life goes on, except of course for the two bodies now lost for ever more.  Anyway, Dell, congratulations: you completed school, got your degree, and a career as a teacher followed.  You married, held nothing back from your lovely wife, and fortunately, there were no children to be affected (I was near to writing infected) by the trauma of your fifteenth year of life.  I end with a line from Shakespeare's Hamlet, '...thus conscience does make cowards of us all.'
B007SGM084|5.0|Definitely a must read, a bit kinky but all in all l thought the trilogy was fantastic! Kept me interested so I couldn't put it down!
B000RW3YYA|5.0|This is a good TV show that I wanted to get for my series. It is good and funny. I hope that you get this tv show series.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|A great game,my family and I love it,love the little minions,they are cute and really funny. love despicable me.<br /><br />Good game really interesting.
B008JFUUIA|5.0|Great feel good flick. I have been avoiding all the dome & gloom movies. No need to bring myself down.
B008H6GHL0|4.0|I am not big on films without real people but I really do think these Resident Evil films are really cool. Love the games & enjoy all the films, real people or not.
B00B0A5XQU|4.0|This was a good book and the characters were interesting. It did get a little drawn out at times, but not enough to put the book down. Good for a light read and a hot cup of tea.
1781162646|5.0|I have been reading King since 1980 & have never looked back. This is a great story told in a very wonderful way.
B0009P5YXO|5.0|Exactly as advertised, this limited edition replica of the tenth doctor's sonic screwdriver is perfect. Invisible ink and UV light work perfectly.
B00452J5IW|4.0|If this does not bring back memories then somebody really has a problem. When artists & drugs & sex ran amok in California.
B007K8ILUQ|5.0|My entire life I've waited to view Fear and Desire - the masterpiece that Stanley Kubrick had tried to destroy.<br /><br />The story goes that Stanley worked to buy back and destroy every print except the one in his archives. I know that there was a print in collection in NYC but that might as well have been a world away from me.<br /><br />The Kino restoration is crisp and striking. The only drawback is the complete lack of special features.<br /><br />Now my collection is complete... It was sad,sir, to realize watching this film that it was the LAST time I would see new Kubrick work.<br /><br />Many have tried to be Stanley (there have been many pretenders - Spielberg's A.I. and Minority Report, STARZ attempt at Spartacus, attempts at Napoleon...) but there will never be another Stanley Kubrick. And there will never be another chance to see new work from the master.<br /><br />Hopefully later there will be a blu-ray with special features. But for now, this Kino Restoration is amazing.
B0000A02TZ|5.0|This is a comedic classic with great acting from a number of well known actors of the future. The college of yesteryear.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|This is a very cute game and I enjoy building the reef with all the different plants and decorations. My little sister enjoys it as much as I do and we play for hours(:
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is really cool and interesting. I've always loved horses! Also, the resolution was really clear on my kindle fire!!! The tabs confused me a little, but I got the hang of it. ;)
B008FTAAG2|4.0|I bought this CD for &#34;Blood&#34; and &#34;Adrenalize&#34; but Maria Brink's voice makes every song great! I don't listen to many rock bands with girl singers, but In This Moment is definitely not your average band with a chick lead vocalist.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love to play this game! But I'm not very good at it but it keeps me entertained. I think others should try it.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is super fun. It's alot like subway surfers but I think this one is alot better. And that's my opinion.
B00DP3IGJ6|5.0|Loved it. Is what a science fiction movie should be, entertaining, riveting, a must see experience. 5 star recommendation.  Happy...
0345529057|5.0|super great book.  Could make the printing larger for us old folks.  At any rate I would buy it again.
B00DJFIMW6|3.0|This game is awsome but when the update came it doesnt even go to one percent<br />Waited thirty minutes and still in zero
B005LUJWBM|3.0|Too technical, too tricky with too many character names to allow reader to keep on top of what's going on. The technical side might be okey for a technocrat, but I just scanned those pages. Also some grammatical errors and a number of typos and incorrect spelling. Not very well written, and perhaps one of his early attempts. Having read a number of his books, I am now ready to move on to other authors.<br /><br />Overall very disappointing compared to his other books.
B000654YRY|5.0|Now I don't have to watch this on youtube anymore. Love this band, this music and EVERYTHING is better on my big screen with my great sound system.
B004ZN9YNC|5.0|Everything great pink Floyd had to offer in the wall. These song that didn't make the cut for the wall come together the final cut.<br />If you are used to Pink Floyd's style and love concept albums this is a great CD for your collection.
B008XG1X18|5.0|pinterest is an amazing site. better than facebook, twitter, etc. it's like facebook, except you don't have to talk to anyone. :) there's something for everyone on here, and I'm not even exaggerating. And the kindle app makes it so user-friendly. there's no reason why you wouldn't want to try something that's as simple and great as this! :) happy pinning.
015206057X|5.0|Such a neat book for mommy or grandmother to read and show action while reading.  This was recommended by a very good friend.
0307716554|5.0|Cleverly plotted psychological suspense told from a spirit's second person POV, which was an usual move, but it worked for me. The ending was somewhat predictable, but I connected with the characters and thoroughly enjoyed the journey. I still, however, rank Lupton's [[ASIN:030771652X Sister: A Novel]] the better book.
B00005K3NY|5.0|It came in great condition.  this is great Canadian thriller which a lot of people have forgotten about. Great stuff.
B006M4F67A|1.0|The game shuffle sometimes resets the whole game instead of just the remaining tiles.<br /><br />You need different times to score the third star.  Times should be the same so you know what time to beat or reach.<br /><br />Poor programming.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love the game. And plus, to end this quickly... every other gaming source is intrigued by your creativity that they're all basically copied your successful idea.

B0002FR0TC|1.0|My daughter and I were so excited to watch Aladdin and I told her how good a movie it was and we put it n the DVD and blu ray player and it wouldn't play in either one I am very upset because it not only didn't work it took forever to arrive to my house I wanted to give a no star review but to ur advantage that option wasn't available. Ur one star was given in default

B00BEZTMFY|5.0|If you are a Lord of the Rings fan then this is a must have.  I have read the book several times and this movie is true to it, It is done just right and once part 2 is out then you can watch both and go to LOR and have the entire story.

B0080SZ0V8|5.0|While the &quot;story&quot; is rather derivative, the puzzles are somewhat amusing.  The world-interaction puzzles tend to have little in the way of stated goals, however, which could be confusing for some people.
1742200508|4.0|I like LP guides for their completeness, but for a typical vacationer it might not be the best use of 2.5 lbs. Lately, I've been relying on the Rick Steves guides, which benefit from being quite focussed, even though I often disagree with his taste in hotels and restaurants.
B000002P72|5.0|Recorded in Chicago in 1964, as a new audience of white rock fans was discovering the blues, Live at the Regal is B.B. King's definitive live set. His guitar sound is precise and powerful, driving emotional versions of some of his most influential songs, including &#34;Every Day I Have the Blues&#34; and &#34;How Blue Can You Get&#34;

B000JJ4PDK|5.0|B.I.G. (a.k.a. Biggie Smalls) took a gritty life experience of his hard-knock Brooklyn youth and crammed it into Ready to Die, hip-hop's greatest debut. &#34;Big Poppa&#34; is the hit sex jam, &#34;Juicy&#34; made you laugh as you danced, and on &#34;Things Done Changed&#34; and &#34;Everyday Struggle&#34; he relates gangsta tales in a voice as thick as his waistline
B004X4R49Y|5.0|I really liked this movie, it was recommended to me by a friend and I enjoyed every minute.  Based on a true story, because of a royal family twist the main character was to become King George, father of Queen Elizabeth.  He was also a human being who suffered trauma and ridicule at a young age that lead to a speech impediment (stuttering).  Fortunately he had the support and love of his wife, and through therapy and hard work he over came and went on to deliver a speech to the country as the new King when war broke out.  It was truly an inspiring story.<br /><br />I meant to rent this movie when it first went to DVD but for whatever reason never did.  I am so glad for the recommendation, it is definitely worth watching.
B00006JLX4|5.0|The quintessential American indie-rock album. The playing is relaxed, the production primitive, the lyrics quirky, the melodies seductive. But the noise-streaked sound is intense, even as Stephen Malkmus displays his love of Seventies-AM pop.
0307271080|2.0|I enjoyed this writer's previous novels and expected to like this one too, but I was disappointed. There are several reasons for this but most of all I have to say that the novel itself seems to be ambiguous, I feel like the author has tried to just pull off too much and got confused along the line covering so much ground, the result is something that is flawed in my personal opinion and slightly cliche. I say that without giving examples so as to not spoil it for someone who may disagree but a large part of the reason I say that is because I find the anti-american sediment that is floating around in novels currently from foreign authors is redundant already at this point. And I feel like begging the question why such an emphasis on hair and weaves?? I think it was a bit slow, a bit longer than necessary and ultimately redundant.

B000FC13Y0|5.0|Neil Gaiman captures the attention and holds tight until you finish the last page.  Like King and Tolkien,  it is a sad thing to close his books, and ESPECIALLY sad to finish one:  it's like saying goodbye to a close friend when you read the last page. Thank goodness for Kindle,  so using have to wait until the bookstore open the next day!
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|By far the easiest home entertainment gadget I've ever purchased. Makes it super easy to \\"mirror\\" video from the browser on my laptop, or start movies from my phone, or show youtube videos that I'm browsing on my tablet. Excellent and easy to use!
B00D6C5Y28|5.0|I first saw this film about a year or two after it came out, when I was in seminary.  I loved the retro//future look then, and the dystopian vision of a fighting an endless war on terror was chilling, even if at the time is seemed somewhat implausible.  I've returned to watch it several times since then, most recently just a few days ago.  Now, the Ministry of Information seems eerily prescient of today's NSA, and Information Retrieval's program of interrogation is reminiscent of the &#34;enhanced interrogation&#34; techniques of the Bush era.  The satire is as brilliant as ever--from those godawful ducts, to Sam's mother's addiction to cosmetic surgery--but the movie seems more timely now than it was 28 years ago.  It is a masterpiece.

B009DCOU9S|3.0|The story is OK but the characters are a bit annoying. I'm having glitches where multiple attempts are needed to pick up an object  but then it will then not interact with the intended item. Frustrating!

B009MYARIK|2.0|Not Sophie's best. Very light read with predictable plot. There was too much trivial dialogue. Disappointed in the development of main characters.
B0048KXRR6|5.0|Emma Thompson is as good or better in this movie as she was in the first Nanny McPhee film.  My 4 granddaughters range in age from 4-9, and they all love the movie!
B00D6QUJ6U|2.0|The quality of the blu ray is no better than my DVD of the same name/concert.  Looks like they just slapped in on a disc with blu ray on it and added a few bonus songs/interview. Waste of money!
B00AFEX83C|4.0|This animated film is a good movie that can be enjoyed by the entire family.  Very well done with a great cast!
B006LSZECO|4.0|Gone Girl is a pretty amazing book. I never read suspenseful or crime type of novels at all in the past so that could be why I really liked this book. I thought it was good and it was good from the beginning. however it did pick up at the middle with twists. I enjoyed It a lot and think its a good book for anyone mid teens and up to read.
B009DCOU9S|5.0|This game is great, a little slow going but since it was free I don't mind. I get quite caught up in the game.

B00BPWDMP2|5.0|I really love the energy on this CD. You can tell just how great they are together.this part of this survey is STUPID
B006LSZECO|4.0|Unusual and distinctly clever technique of storytelling. Compelling in its ability to keep you guessing early on and as the main plot twist is revealed, maintains its hold on the reader through a connection with the characters that you don't even realize you've made. Was a little disappointed with the conclusion as it seemed somewhat anticlimactic following what seemed like a buildup to a confrontational crescendo, which never really occurs. Still a fun and worthwhile read.
B00CT2P6VA|5.0|LOVE all the Quell games and this one is even better than the first two.  Get it, you'll not be disappointed.
B001AQO3QA|4.0|Excellent packaging with extras. Old school value in a video package. Many of these collections have little more than the movies but this collection is attractively packaged and contains some behind the scenes extras and add-ons that are fun and interesting. I purchased it as a Gold Box Deal of the day at a tremendous discount but this is definitely worth purchasing for movie collectors.
B004FGMDOQ|5.0|This was one of the most thought out and mind blowing stories I have ever read. The author paints vivid pictures in your mind all throughout the book and strategically weaves photos into the storyline.  This storyline is absolutely amazing and no lose ends are left untied. This book will definitely surprise you when everything comes together in the end. I recommend this book to everyone young and old because it will shock and amaze you until the end. I can't wait for the next book to be released.
B007L6VR6M|5.0|Okay, so you know a Wes Anderson film when you see it. They have a look and a feel. Visually they pop with color. Dialogue is usually clipped and clever and the characters and situations ooze a similar quirkiness. He even managed the same feel in the stop-motion animated \\"Fantastic Mr. Fox.\\" But these elements can often feel \\"schticky\\" and have in many of his movies left me disconnected or disinvested. In short, not taking them very seriously.<br /><br />Not so with Moonrise Kingdom. Moonrise Kingdom for me is a home run because Mr. Anderson's devices all work here throughout and actually help connect the viewer with the movie. The colors and cinematography work perfectly in telling the story of two angst-filled tweens running away together on a tiny (fictitious) island off the New England coast. The setting is an odd little place with odd little customs and lifestyle so the quirkiness of the characters and situations work naturally.<br /><br />The performances of the ensemble cast are also spot on and the two new-comers in the lead roles have an endearing chemistry. Mr. Anderson also treats any physicality between the kids with taste and humor and though they are both troubled and have chosen a troubled and hopeless path, you root for them anyway.<br /><br />Moonrise Kingdom scores for me because it deals with innocent, uncomplicated emotions, in an innocent, uncomplicated setting and delivers its story in a fun, uncomplicated package that is well paced, with a well balanced mix of interesting characters, beautiful locations, clever dialogue and emotions with which we can all identify. As I've said to many who have disagreed with me, \\"What's not to like?\\"
B0019NG73G|4.0|I was in Pickett's charge in the movie as a reenactor.  Did not see enough of what we did for a full week in the movie, but the Director's Cut was better than the theater version.<br /><br />If you are interested in history, this Blu-ray Disk is well worth the money.<br /><br />The Blu-ray format gives a much more vivid picture, almost 3d.
B00E9HML1Q|3.0|Would order it but don't have blu ray don't intend to get blu ray and certainly not going to pay that kind of money just for the statue.

0399255370|4.0|My grandson loved it and even more important, so did his mom.  Cute graphics and fun story for readers of all ages.
0446556750|5.0|What I liked so much about this was how Connelly had Harry Bosch as a secondary character in the book and not the main character.  It was strange enough that the lawyer and Bosch were related.  Since I've been reading the Harry Bosch books out of sequence, I'm wondering where in the other Lincoln Lawyer and Harry Bosch books does it go into more details about their relationship.  What can I say....Michael Connelly is magic.
B004J4WKTW|3.0|First off, I love fantasy. I try to be open minded about it. But while the concept was unique and some of the scenes wonderful, I felt it had some unbearably slow and unnecessary moments, and tried far too hard to be \\"magical\\". In my opinion, this would have made a better short story or novella. We really don't need to hear about every tent. Really. The details were entirely unrelated to the storyline, and felt like perhaps the author was trying to fill a word count instead of tell a story.<br /><br />Second, I felt like the author completely lost interest in her main characters at the end, and found a cheap way out of her problem that I guessed from the moment it became possible. The romance felt rushed and forced towards the end, and they only learned anything significant about each other after deciding they were in love, which isn't how love should work, to me. And then the end isn't in their perspective at all!<br /><br />The whole thing had composition problems, in my opinion, but despite all of that I did appreciate the idea behind it, so it wasn't a total loss.
044661758X|5.0|I love all the Harry Bosch novels.  Connelly is an incredible writer.  The only thing I'm sorry about is that I've been reading the Harry Bosch series out of sequence.  The book of course stands on its own, but down the line after I've collected all the Harry Bosch books that I haven't read, I may reread them in sequence.
B00CTKHXFO|4.0|This is a really superb collection of all original Metal Gear games ever released. The only reason why this will not get 5 stars is because the code for MGS1 is region locked to the US. But even for European customers and without MGS1, this is still a more than awesome collection of 25 years of one of the greatest gaming brands.
B00CL68QVQ|5.0|slow, intriguing, strange, and then a powerful boost that you we're expecting but not really ready for and doubting a bit. A great movie!
B007712XAU|5.0|I had heard about this series and since  don't pay for the pay stations, this would be the only way to watch them and I loved them.
B003YFIUW8|5.0|You would think a story about a woman who got kidnapped and raped daily for seven years would be just disturbing and awful from her five year old son's perspective, but this was well thought out and well written. I literally finished this book in three days, it was a great read.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|If Season 3 is anything like 1 and 2 it will be great.  Just received and no time to view.
B006LSZECO|5.0|The whole book was just a well thought out, clever story; however, the end was slightly disappointing since the rest of the book was clever, you'd expect that to be just as good, but it fell flat. It was as if the author just ran out of time and made it up in five minutes. The rest of it was amazing though. I couldn't put it down.
B006LSZECO|3.0|this book took a long time to get to the point, I think the writer could not decide on an ending that would satisfy everyone.<br />I was disappointed in the ending. looked like this guy could not better himself if he tried.
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|This book perfectly reflects Tina Fey as a person. It was hilarious and thoroughly enjoyable. It also gave me a new perspective on the shows and movies she helped to produce, like 30 Rock or Mean Girls. Very cool.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I cried. A lot. But I really enjoyed the characters. The banter and conversation was enjoyable. The love story was so sweet.
B003UMW68Y|5.0|A true classic and great songs for everyone to enjoy. I grew up with this movie I still have the VHS version of this but I no longer have the VHS so I thought I'd get an upgraded version of the movie. :D
B002KQ6BT6|3.0|I did not enjoy The Lost Symbol as much as I have enjoyed his other books. His best book is De Vinci Code
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is my favorite game ever you can jump over obstacles go into houses slide into a pool it is so much fun you can play in elmachos lair and run in grus lab this is my favorite game ever the graphics are amazing every time I play my kindle I have to play this
B002MQYOFW|4.0|Not a very like able topic for a story, but the author does an excellent job of putting the reader into the main characters situation.  You feel every emotion. As I read, I kept thinking how terrible this concept would be if it were real.
B0036S4B6M|5.0|Awesome book couldn't stop turning the pages. Great look into women in federal prison.Eye opening to how are prisons are ran.
B00AALHW6Y|5.0|We have been playing it over and over again in the month we've had this CD. Darius Rucker's voice is distinct and moving. Every age in my family, from 8 - 53, sings along (LOUDLY) when it plays in the car. Wonderful!
B00AFROVQC|1.0|Repetitive language, unbelievable story and inconsistent characters. Too many things happen to the main character in a very short timespan, but surprisingly none of it gets the story going, and it does not bring anything to the characters either. I only makes the whole setup completely unbelievable. The book is just terrible at all levels.
B000UR9T82|5.0|The blu-ray Spider-Man trilogy is MUCH better than I thought it would be. The picture and sound is way more AMAZING than its standard DVD counterparts and makes what I thought look so fake on DVD look so real on blu-ray. Quite the restoration and what's more is that Spider-Man 2 has both theatrical and 2.1 (which is not that much different) but still a bonus. Great picture. Great sound. Great set. Great price. My only complaint is that each movie does not have as much special features as the DVD ones which is odd for blu-ray but nevertheless get ready to be wowed!
B00BEIYMAG|5.0|Dont listen to anyone if they say its boring or not horrifying! They were properly the ones screaming but watch the movie it makes you jump and you will not be able to take your eyes away. Some bits would make you laugh i would recommend this movie to everyone. Well directed and brilliant actors and actresses.<br /> Watch now, movie of the year!
B004SI8WX2|5.0|This book should be required reading in High School and a guid in college Anthropology. There is so much society can/should learn from this writing.<br />Thank You Marlo Morgan for your unselfish sacrifice.<br />Chiquita
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love this game and glad there are different areas to enter and explore can't wait for more levels in the future.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Supper cool. You go through 3 different levels. 1 the lab then you fight vector 2 your outside and then you fight another boss 3 Dom guy's lair and another boss
1592402038|5.0|They said the book was going to have writing in it and I didn't find a single blemish! Overall awesome!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is AWESOME ! Lolzzz thx gameloft but I think dat u guys should let &quot;Gru&quot; be apart of the action (running , rolling , jumping ) and help the minions other than that the game was amazing ! ;)
B0071XO8RA|1.0|Skip the audio version.  Narration is very poor & characterizations are even worse.  Storyline seems thin & shallow but perhaps a quality narrator would improve that.  Unfortunately, has ruined any temptation to read printed versions...
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Lovvve it so much fun had a great time playing it huge minion fan love the movie all out it is a great game
B004XUMMFE|5.0|I just discovered this series while reading a review on something. Since I have Amazon Prime I went and checked it out and became hooked.  Such great writing, casting, production, special effects and overall plots. Gosh, I just love this series and ONLY ONE SEASON!!! I can't believe it that they canceled this series or that another channel didn't pick it up right away. Production did a formidable job in casting the crew for this production and the guest actors in villain roles were really great. A good number of these actors have gone to do great series (Nathan Fillion &#34;Castle&#34;, Christina Hendricks &#34;Mad Men&#34;) I've down to my last couple of episodes and then there's the movie Serenity that I can't wait to watch.  I'm sad I'm reaching the end of it though. Canceled way too soon.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game was a pure funny one I shall tell you so if you like this review play it ok
B009LH1Y1W|5.0|Awesome Series, Hoping to see more in season nine.  I was hooked on season one and could not stop till season eight was over.

B002WJI658|2.0|I'd give it a higher score if I got a legitimate plush from Sanei, but I didn't. I got mine from a Chinese seller which should've made me suspicious, and when it arrived the circle of the cap was not completely there and the upside L on one of the gloves faced the wrong way. Some facial proportions are also wrong. Word of warning to be careful of which seller you get this plush from.
B000HC2LI0|3.0|Yes ... you heard correctly.  Disc 41 says disc 41 (season 7) on the label, but the contents of the disc are from season 6.  Now I need to figure out how to get this one disc replaced.  That may prove hard, because we bought this set several years ago, and we've just now gotten that far into the set.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|good game and fun. i like think a lot of peolpe will like to play. i hope a lot of them play it.
B000ICXQF6|5.0|Bruce Willis in a not Die Hard part is very convincing. In my opinion one of his better movie efforts.
B0073LWEXK|5.0|I just finished this game and can say that I loved it!  Beautiful graphics, good story, not too difficult (some games have challenges that I really wonder if anyone would figure out on their own)! I loved having a map and a journal (so I don't have to keep writing things down on my own).  I didn't mind all the wandering about, for me, that's what an adventure game is all about. I hesitated about getting this game, but am really glad that I finally gave it a try!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I stumbled across Wool totally by accident while searching Kindle titles.  It ended up being a read I simply couldn't put down.  The story was both chilling and gripping.  It is science fiction but the compelling part about it is the ability to see how it could become science fact.  The mystery of how and why the silos came to be is ongoing and keeps the reader intrigued page after page until finally the true enemy is revealed.  If you've ever read 1984 and found it hard to get out of your head, then Wool is strongly recommended for you.  Just know that it'll keep you awake nights.
B000FC1MCS|5.0|This is not a book to read to get powerful literature. It is however, a book that is realistic in the world of autism. I think people should read this to get some perspective about people with mental health issues. Christopher feels that he is normal just like you and me.
B007Z9QP3K|5.0|This is what cinema is all about.  Conveying a moment in time and transporting the watcher to play a part.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Cant wait for season 4.They have not made it to the Great Depression yet. Should be soon.might watch Upstairs/Downstairs until then.
B0064X7FVE|2.0|I'm sure they paid a lot to mess up an app that used to be clean and useful. Some group.decided it needed to have a social component and rewards, and of course advertising. I expect they want me to engage in it, really spend time and tell them what I'm doing, give them Facebook style marketing info...WHEN ALL I WANT IS THE WEATHER REPORT.
B001NLKXK2|4.0|This is an excellent portrayal of what it must be like to go through the stages of Alzheimers for victim and family.
B0036TGT3E|5.0|I don't think there are many people who would feel that the film itself deserves any less than five-stars, so I'm mostly going to talk about the over all package. The film on blu-ray looks great. I loved watching it in high definition. The bonus features were extensive and interesting to watch. One day after watching the movie, I was up all night going through all of the bonus content, and there is a lot of it. It took me hours to go through it all, and I was quite pleased. Altogether, it's like having an extra movie about the entire making of the actual film. There were videos where they went through the creation process for the characters, what was involved in making the film, tricks they used, obstacles they encountered, how they overcame those obstacles, how the story developed over time, how the artists learned to draw the characters (hint: actual lions in the studio), how they chose music artist, how the music artist felt about working on the film and how they came up with the songs. They show the story boards, and early versions of a certain scene. I could go on and on. There are even videos discussing the making of the Broadway musical version of Lion King, and how that came to be. Even at the very late hours of night, I found it all to be quite interesting. As an amateur artist, I found some of these areas especially interesting because it gives you a good idea of what went into making this film. There were even \\"bloopers\\", haha. Keep in mind, that these bloopers are not real. They were purposely made to be released as a bonus feature just a little joke. Real bloopers like that just don't really happen in animated films because everything is looked over so carefully and everything has to be consciously drawn. They were funny. I don't know what else one could want to be included. This blu-ray disc had everything on it, and you could spend the majority of your day going through it. This is one of my favorite films, and I couldn't ask for much more. If you like this film, you should buy this. I can't think of any reason why you'd regret it.e this film, you should buy this. I can't think of any reason why you'd regret it.

B004QSQMKE|5.0|I bought this movie for my husband for Christmas. The product is just what I ordered. Wasn't scratched or anything.
B004SEUIWO|5.0|I not only absolutely love movies but I absolutely love the 1920's too! Considering these 2 things about my myself, I thought Chicago (DVD) would be a worthwhile purchase. It most definitely was.<br /><br />Not knowing about the original musical, I had no idea about what the plot would be. I expected it to be like the more current film, The Artist. It would document the jazz age and how it changed through the years. But BOY, I was sure wrong! This film is about the scandalous and dirty celebrity life of the 1920's Jazz Age. I was shocked, fascinated, and disgusted, by the characters and events in this movie. But at the same time, I found humor and fun in it.<br /><br />I especially loved the concept of a jazz show narrating the movie as it went along. It took me a minute to grasp what was going on. How strange for a current movie! I also enjoyed the casting.<br /><br />Chicago was an all around fun movie and it would be worthwhile to watch again and show to friends.
B006GWO5NE|2.0|My daughter and I are on our 2nd Kindle Fire. Amazon was great in replacing both of our Kindles and even express shipped them so we could have them the next day to take on vacation. That was 8 months ago, our new kindles just  stopped charging! Both of ours stopped. So I call amazon and their answer was to send us these new power cords with the promise that they will for sure correct the \\"faulty\\" chargers that came with the kindle. REALLY?!? Needless to say it only charges half the time, a far cry from what amazon promised it would do. Bottom line is that as much as I love my Kindle, I would never buy another one or recommend it. Amazon should be ashamed for putting out a product that they know has issues.

B003TJR2HS|5.0|I bought this to use with a Metra Axxess CRIP-01 I purchased cheaply from an auction site to install in my Jeep Liberty. The CRIP-01 only charged early generation Apple devices. Using this adapter, I am able to charge my iPod touch 3rd Gen.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|I didn't think i would really enjoy this movie after all the hype. Was I ever wrong. I watched this 2x as I hungered for it again. A must see movies suitable for many ages.
B003G4W49C|5.0|Okay so I'm sitting in the movie watching the coming attractions and I see a trailer for this awesome movie called Enders game. never heard of it before but I'm a fan of young adult fiction so I thought I'll check it out. im so glad that I did.
B00CY1JUW2|4.0|Love this band and they don't disappoint. I still find myself comparing everything they do to Rated R though. I love that they don't keep making the same record over and over. They really get groovy on this one. &#34;I sat by the ocean&#34;, &#34;If I had a tail&#34;, &#34;My God is the sun&#34; are my faves.<br /><br />Keep it up Josh. You keep make 'em, I'll keep buy'n 'em.<br /><br />Yafeelmeh?!
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Its a great game at first and after the updates it will start advertising some games that look cheap and blurry, I beleive it read, no advertisements,,, still fun!
B000FBJAEG|4.0|Really enjoyable read with plenty of action and tension.  Saved King and Maxwell until I had read the rest of Baldacci.  Great start to these characters.  Looking forward to the rest of their series.
B00AAQRNQ8|4.0|I was originally looking at a Razer DeathAdder mouse, but the reviews for it left me unimpressed. I happened to see this mouse in the \\"items similar to this\\" and instantly became interested.<br /><br />Mouse:<br />The mouse is solid and does not feel cheap. For my hand size, the thumb buttons are just right. I do tend to hold the mouse towards the back, so the button located above the roller wheel and between the two main buttons is sometimes hard to reach. (I currently use it to toggle my defibs in BF3).<br /><br />Software:<br />You have to manually download the software from their website to change the mouse settings as there is no software included with the mouse.<br /><br />Packaging:<br />The packaging is pretty slick and left me feeling good about my purchase. It comes with instruction manual, mouse, bookmark, and a case with small little weights. (I installed the weights, but it did not seem to make a noticeable difference).<br /><br />Customer Service:<br />I have been contacted twice since receiving my mouse from customer service, both times they wanted to ensure I was happy with my product.<br /><br />Cons:<br />I really do not have any complaints, but I would love it if they fixed the mouse software so it would not popup directly between my dual monitors. It is kind of annoying to have to move it EVERY time.<br /><br />Conclusion:<br />This is my first Anker product and I am pleasantly surprised with my purchase. I would gladly purchase another product from Anker.

0670022411|5.0|Scholarship, Style and a great imagination all allow Deborah Harkness to tell us the definintive story o fwitches, their world and their ways. Harkness is an Elizabethan scholar. Her main character Diana is studying alchemy, its present and Mediebal to Elizabethan past. Harkness makes us feel we are really back in Elizabethan times trying to turn pig's ears to gold and find the immortal Philosopher's stone which like the Ark of the Covenant brings immortality and power to whoever controls it. Almost every page we meet either a new witch, demon, or vampire who shakes us and propels the story forward. There is a magical book that has been lost until Diana finds it that causes a great uproar in the community of the Others. But the BIG story here, the one around which lesser stories turn, is a forbidden love story  It's the story of a growing romance between the young powerful witch Diana and the sleek, mannered, vampire with morals Matthew. This is fun, dangerous and a bit carnal, too. You want style? This is not Harknesses first rodeo. She writes with an ease and grace  that makes Discovery of Witches rise above most mortal fare. A bewitching triumph!

B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|This series captures your heart, creates suspense, and brings the alluring question of how the other half lives to life.
B00C061I3K|5.0|This is a pretty good album, in fact, it is one of the better albums I have heard this year. But it is very electronic heavy but the hit songs are very addictive.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Actually, my daughter ordered this book.  She said it was really good and I should read it.  She was right.  Although classified as a &#34;young adult&#34; read, it would appeal to a broad age range.<br />The book is about (primarily) 3 teens, all around 18, who have cancer.  It really gives one some insight into how someone with cancer, regardless of stage, deals with it, their thought process and how it impacts not only them but their families and others around them. It's not all &#34;rosey&#34; but it's not particularly depressing either. It would be a good assigned reading for a class.
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|The characters in this show are great. I am currently in law school and professors love to discuss the ethical violation that happen in this show frequently. THIS DOES NOT REFLECT THE LIFE OF MOST LAWYERS. But it is highly entertaining and will teach you some pretty true stuff about civil procedure and some substantive legal principles.
B00B7NPRY8|3.0|Not as good as I hoped. I kept thinking that something incredible would happen but it never did.This book is ranked very high on many sci-fi book lists, but it is decent at best.
B004QZ9PLU|5.0|This book was wonderful. A story that leaves you pondering long after you put it down. Intense and sad about long lost love.

0811870987|5.0|It is not your usual bird book at all.  The photographer is more an artist than naturalist from the old school. It gives the bird lover and thorough enjoyment of birds. The approach is so fantastic and exciting that you don't want to miss it.  Andrew Zuckerman is a genius.  Thank you Andrew Zuckerman!
B00A4YZWN2|3.0|Intriguing story but a dissatisfying ending. It never really seemed to take off the way the first two books did, and the &#34;conclusion&#34; could easily lead to another book, even though the main issue was resolved... I'm disappointed.
B00A3NQNUU|3.0|Fun and dragons and more fun fun fun. Facebook game. easy to do things in the game. Your going to be super happy person

Like I said WHAT'S NOT TO LIKE ON THIS ONE !!!
0316247545|5.0|This book is a fun read for kids and bronies alike, giving a lot of information on the show, characters, song lyrics, and even contains interviews with the people who worked on the show as well as Lauren Faust herself. This is well worth the money I paid for it.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game so much, i literally play it all day. Im. Dead. Serious. I mean, its so cool...hoverboards, flying with the paint cans in a cool, colorful fashion! I love it. And im glad it was created. :)

B00000DCHI|5.0|Love the song &#34;Just the Way You Are.&#34;  Bought it just for that one song really.  But then all the other Billy Joel's &#34;greatest hits&#34; were good too.
B00BP4Z8XY|5.0|Pretty decent kids movie. It tried to be interesting for children and their parents. I suddenly had the urge to go to the arcade.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book is very good and I will end up reading the whole series, thanks to the author itself! Recommend this to any one, sure they will love it :-)
B00D6BQPMM|4.0|It played off Romeo & Juliet. I so would not kiss a zombie since it had (even if controlled by nature) ate human brains!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I think the correct word for this game is addicting, it has a variety of levels, and is a fun time killer.
B004HWYTP4|3.0|It was not as bad@$$ as I was hoping with Bruce Willis and Morgan Freeman. I so don't believe the storyline between the &#34;30yr old&#34; and Bruce's character.
0440246016|5.0|Low cost way to start reading an author I hadn't read before.  I got all 18 books used and I can read from the first to the latest at my leisure.
B00AYDC5HY|2.0|I was interested due to stop motion; however, the story line was weird even for Tim Burton. I didn't finish the movie due to boredom.

B00APUYWYA|3.0|It seemed like it was mainly playing off the tail end of the &#34;High school musical&#34; and &#34;Glee&#34; audience. It was most likely a movie to help get new actors/actresses on the Hollywood scene.

B00BGIBVP8|3.0|What was in the previews was the majority of the funny parts. It was slow on delivering the plot and side characters were not fully developed to fit the story.
0812550706|4.0|Pretty good book overall.  However, the reader is asked to believe that highly gifted children can think of strategy and killing in depth.  It's Science Fiction, but I don't quite buy the premise.
B003U6BE8I|4.0|I wasn't too interested in the movie since it seemed like a tween movie. The plot was decent and that acting was on point. I would not mind seeing any other movies adapted from this series of books.
0061438294|5.0|This book is not the standard body language information.  It is well done with photos and explanations and easy to understand.  I am already noticing other people's body language and seeing where our conversation is falling flat!!  Good read!
B00CDT41RY|5.0|New storyline! Funny and serious parts. It kept me interested and definitely fits Tarantino's normal genre of movies. Deserves awards.
B00DHSK3RM|1.0|who even buy this without candy crush on there kindle. I mean come on people I would give it a good rating if candy crush was on here
0142403873|5.0|My 4 year old loves this story!  It's a good read for the parent too.  I always smile at the humor.
0618680004|5.0|I really enjoyed this book. This is actually the second time I posted this review, because the first time I did so, created a firestorm of negative comments, hopefully this time this can be avoided. Keep in mind these are my opinions of the book and I make no scientific claims since I am no scientist; however I thoroughly appreciated the reading material. If you disagree, please reserve your comments to yourself, I did not post a review to get into a mindless debate. Send your comments to the book's author. This is just a product review, similar to one buying a car, each person's experience will be different though the same product.<br /><br />The knowledge, arguments and concepts contained in this book was astounding. Admittedly, I have always had a great interest in science and this issue; however, Richard Dawkins has vastly opened my mind to a different perspective of thinking, utilizing knowledge, understanding and convincing conclusions. Every word encompassed in this material was so riveting; I was suspenseful awaiting the next sentence. This book explains some of the scientific facts, historical events, current trends, and future advancements with such prose and elegance, that my mind desired more enlightenment at every turn. His vocabulary is of the higher echelon, so a dictionary at times will be necessary; however, that is the beauty of learning, to acquire insight into that which was once unknown, but for the most part his writing is accessible for the laymen. This book inspired me so much, that I spent several days researching and absorbing additional information regarding M-Theory, String Theory, Evolution, Cosmology and Physics. This book has completely liberated my mind and has changed my life, though I was already on the path of departing organized religion, this embodiment of material provided me the additional keys to further solidify my observations. Many of the positions the author takes were somewhat previously shared in common, but it was made complete by devouring this body of work. I have been so inspired, that I have obtained other reading materials by Dawkins, such as the Blind Watchmaker, The Selfish Gene, The Extended Phenotype. I must say he is a masterful writer and a most brilliant scientific mind.<br /><br />Once again these are just MY opinions, so it is totally fine if you do not share them, BUT I do not NEED someone to explain it to me, allow me to discover additional knowledge and understanding ON MY OWN. I am a grown man, so I do not need anyone's unsolicited assistance. Thanks in advance for respecting as such.complete by devouring this body of work.

B000SCHC0Q|5.0|This book is really excellent. The writing is amazing...so beautifully written. When we think of 9/11 and the Taliban and such here in America, we have a nebulous sense of how things were in Afghanistan. But this book makes the suffering and injustices crystal clear. Big events affect everyday lives. We all know where we were when we heard about 9/11; some of us remember the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan and celebrating their withdrawal. This book lets us know how these events affected the everyday lives of the people there. But the book isn't just educational; the education is incidental to the wonderfully woven story.
B002GHHHI8|2.0|The movie was too far away from the book story to be worth the cost of the DVD. So, Dont buy it.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game is awsome you get your own world and make it you own way in creative.and you get to test your skills in survival. It will keep you entertained for hours.
B005IQZB14|4.0|An honest and mesmerizing memoir.  I'm a trail angel on the Appalachian Trail, and Cheryl reaffirmed what hikers show me--how sweet the comforts we take for granted really are.

B00COGZ8FU|3.0|Good action, a little predicable, and only slightly tracks the book.  Jack Reacher is big, bald headed guy, and much more ruthless...
B00B5HQKNI|5.0|This is an excellent movie well in the tradition of Ian Flemming greats. We enjoyed a pleasant evening at home watching Skyfall for a fraction of what it would have cost us for a night at a theater.
B00CWVGBEO|3.0|Good action, but a little silly and predictable.  The plot is a little hard to believe and the circumstances of some of the action is comical.  Just turn off your reasoning powers, sit back and enjoy Sheriff Schwarzenegger kick butt.
B000I3PA8Q|5.0|It was very funny! I loved the storyline. Let's hope that we have whales in the future, so they won't have to go through all this trouble again! Hahaha :)
B00CRWJ5GO|2.0|Didn't like the plot or the story line...  Shut it down halfway through, so much so, I forgot what it was about..
B00ANVX6DY|4.0|The movie is good.  My daughter loves Sofia the First.  The only reason I didn;t give 5 stars is because I received 2 movies and I refuse to bother returning it.  It's kind of confusing and time consuming to return an item.
B00BUAEYVK|5.0|A Bruce Willis fan and would watch him in most anything. Love all of the Die Hard movies. This one was refreshing and not a continuing saga. It was great to watch.
B00DMM3WVM|5.0|Pikpok really out done themselves with this game. The 1 person experience really looks cool. They make the zombies look real.
B000063V8R|5.0|The sets, especially this one are pricey. I still give it 5 stars because of the introduction and episode selection. The only thing I don't like is the window after an episode ends. To push the &#34;engage&#34; button, will start playing the same episode over. I have to go back to the episode selection window to select the next epiosode I want to play. In spite of that, I like everything else, and will work to collect them all.
B00BFUUMO8|2.0|I simply loved this game but i had to force stop so many times until it crashed it had to many bugs and when i tried to access it it would just kick me out this game was good . I put so much hours in it just so it could just go to waste
B00D6BN9NK|1.0|I've generally enjoyed the Die Hard franchise; especially the first film in the series.  This turkey, \\"A Good Day To Die Hard\\", was a complete waste of time and money.  It is so bad that it is just one more of those movies that I have to ask myself:  \\"Why did they even bother making it\\"?  It was an easily answered question: \\"It's the money, stupid\\".  This movie is nothing more than a con, a means of getting you to spend your hard-earned bucks and using it's past successes to lure you into believing that you're going to be entertained by another over-the-top action movie.  \\"A Good Day...\\" is loud and obnoxious and so ridiculous in virtually every aspect of it's production that I was barely able to sit through the whole mess. Among the more annoying aspects of this movie is the fact that there is not even the merest hint of character development.  McClane's son, played by Jai Courtney, is just there, a totally unlikeable character from the get go.  There is absolutely no believable chemistry between Willis and Courtney.  I never believed for a second that there was any kind of father-son bond.  There was, of course, the obligatory and woefully unconvincing reconciliation scene where father and son have to fess up that they actually love one another, etc.  Because of the animosity displayed by the son throughout the movie towards his father up to that point, it was an obvious set-up for this scene--and a wasted one.  I just had absolutely no feelings about ANY of the characters in this film, let alone this totally unbelievable father-son relationship.<br /><br />Even the bad guys stunk in this film.  Rasha Bukvic tried to play one the main badass heavies and seemed to be trying--and completely failing--to channel Christoph Waltz from \\"Inglorious Basterds\\".  He was so unconvincing that I was just sorry that he was not terminated earlier than he was just to be done with his horrible acting. I won't even bother to get into the pathetic script, dialogue and plot holes.  Suffice it to say that this wannabe buddy movie was a complete disaster from beginning to end.  I would strongly recommend that you not waste your money on watching it as I did.  If you're going to watch it, wait until it shows up as a free offering sometime in the near future.  It will still waste your time, but at least you won't have squandered your money on it.ffice it to say that this wannabe buddy movie was a complete disaster from beginning to end.

B00AO2P3GA|5.0|The Best fps (in my opinion) this game is pretty good gameloft has done it again another successful game made by these brilliant people one con is the campaign you go to the &quot;good guys&quot; to the &quot;bad guys&quot; I just wish one could stay one person but yeah other than that it is a good game FPS people who are out there BUY THIS Game.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Awesome show. Great look at historical times, the craziness of the classes & great characters that you get connected to. It's full of drama, humor, & fabulous acting. After watching the first episode we couldn't wait to see the next. My husband and I are hooked!
0525953728|2.0|Sorry, I really wanted to like this, if I could be anything in the world, it would be SEAL. But I'm a cry baby and will complain over a minor inconvenience and seek medical advise for a hang nail.  Unfortunately this book wasn't entertaining, descriptive, funny, sad, or even informative.  \\"Mark Owen\\" gave a better account of the experience in a 60 Minutes interview.

B0014BY72Q|5.0|Despite terrible acting by Michael York and Jenny Agutter, the film is fantastic.  The supporting cast is terrific: Peter Ustinov steals the movie; Richard Jordan's descent into mad obsession is great.  Superb story, fun to watch.  Carousel begins....
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Nice level of challenge.  Not too hard but definitely not too easy.  It keeps you on your game and thinking.
B003V40SGS|4.0|Full-length live action film by Disney.  Pretty good story, some funny parts.  A bit scary for smaller children.  The robots voiced by Slim Pickens and Roddy McDowell are the best part of the film.  Worth watching if you've never seen it.
B00B5A9FLY|2.0|Big disappointment: 5 stars for actors and 1 star for writers.<br /><br />Everyone especially Colin Morgan acted really well in this series, seems like their acting matured. Wish I could say the same about the writers though. The series started with a warning of how it's going to end, the disappointment started there. The writers forgot all the promises they made in all the previous seasons: great destiny, united Albion, a great king, magic restored. Everything was futile in the end and we keep wondering \\"what was the purpose of all this?\\"; wish I had never watched the season 5.
B0013F1D02|5.0|Excellent move with a captivating storyline, excellent acting and great special effects.  Funny, suspenseful, action-adventure fantasy.  Robert DeNiro's lightning pirate is fantastic and Michelle Pfeiffer's evil witch is frightening!

B0051ANPZQ|5.0|I got this as a library book, but the book was so amazing, I honestly should've coughed up a million bucks just got the book. The story is based around August, or \\"Auggie\\", a 10-year-old boy who has severe facial deformations. After spending all of elementary school at home, as well as most of his life, his parents force him to attend a private school, Beecher Prep. The experience changes him. He laughs and cries and screams and trembles through the year, facing challenge after challenge, and by the end of the year, he, as well as you, will be new. He sees the world a little different. Sees people a little different. And you will too, so heck, you better bust your tail getting out your wallet, because this book is essentially a life changer!!!<br />Oh, and I also recommend \\"Out of My Mind\\" (Sharon M. Draper, 2011).<br /><br />Erbie's Reviews, August 2013

B00CTKHXFO|5.0|I can't begin to tell you how great it is to have the whole collection of Metal Gear Solid games in one collection! I purchased a PS3 again just so I could get this game!
B009DCOU9S|5.0|Only on level 3 but it's fun so far I would recommend it's better than normal search games! Fun I would prefer to rate after playing longer but it keeps prompting me to review.
1781162646|5.0|Loved the book.  Written in typical Stephen King fashion, I was not disappointed.  Story was great, characters interesting and it's a fast and exciting read.
B004QL7K70|5.0|One of the best party movies in a long time, i strongly suggest that you give this movie a try, one of my favorites!
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|I only wish that there were more games like this! Challenging but not too frustrating. This was a lot of fun.
B000XUBFE2|3.0|I wish I could give it a half rating. I wanted to give it a 4 but just couldn't, some places it was all over the place, others it was focused. I guess I'm just not a fan of his writing style after this second book of his I read. Good history though.
B008YKGQR4|4.0|it does what its supposed to, lets me read facebook and check on what my friends are doing while in waiting rook at chemo for my wife.
B00DW39B2K|4.0|... and you won't be too disappointed.<br /><br />Nice low budget flick.  Sets and scenery were great, acting not so bad, and story is so-so.  The lemonade scene was pretty funny; for a torture scene.  Best thing about this movie is it was filmed here in Georgia!  Wish I could have seen this at the theater.
B00DAXXO98|5.0|House of cards is absorbing and Kevin Spacey is incredible. If this is the way government works, we are in trouble. . Can't wait for season 2.
B00881VLCE|1.0|This was best puzzle on market until you updated it. The 216 pieces were just right for my Kindle.  Now the 140 is not difficult enough and the 280 piece choice is too small. I wish I could undo the update and go back to the way it was originally.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Amazing book overall. I cried at moments and laughed at others. This is the kind of book you never want to end. Huge round of applause to John Greene for his amazing work. Augustus Waters- I will love you forever! Hazel reminded me a lot of Talia Joy Castellano, although they were fighting different types of cancer their attitudes were so similar. Thank you John Greene for this beyond amazing read.
B004HWYTP4|5.0|I love Bruce Willis films. This one totally snuck past me when it hit the theaters. I could not believe the first 5 minutes!!  Holy Cow!!  Who knew??  John Malkovic had the perfect role, too. Eccentric and paranoid, with a very funny twisted mind. Now I can't wait to see the sequel.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I have already purchased the Shift Omnibus. This book was very good, I highly recommend it!! You don't want to stop reading once you start. Can't wait to start Shift!
B008IBPMZG|5.0|I love the story lines and character building. It is very true to the era as far as I can perceive. Lots of turns this 2nd season! I was really happy with the ending, and cannot wait to start Season 3 (which is now free too!).<br />Thanks!
B0064X7FVE|5.0|Just confused on the points thing and It works, no problems no trouble. That's all that matters. And I can see the weather when I want we're I want.
030758836X|2.0|This book was highly recommended, so our book club read it. No one liked it. When I found out Nick's secret, the book completely ended for me. Then the ending sealed the nails in the coffin to a two star review.  I did not like any of the characters, they were so self absorbed and whiny. Amy and Nick were completely co-dependent.  I really felt more sympathy for Amy than anyone else. Her crazy parents were totally to blame for her psychosis. This opinion is based on reading a great non fiction book, Evil Genes, Why Rome Fell, Hitler Rose, Enron Failed and My Sister Stole My Mother's Boyfriend. That book describes how an early life event can cause dis-associative personality disorder and turn someone into a psychopath. Anyway, the way the chapters went from Nick to Amy throughout the book kept me reading. I read it fast and felt it was a page turner and couldn't put it down, until it unraveled with Nick's secret. Then I felt like I just had to finish for book club. Flynn likes to flesh out the insidious dark side of women, and that she did with this book, and Amy was not the only character who was that way. My biggest criticism is the development of Nick. He was such a typical guy, wants the cool girl, the cool life, and then he just bails on all of it. And since he was so typical, his staying at the end is NOT possible, it does not fit his character. Guys cut their losses and run. He held all the cards at the end,(and you know Amy would slip again like she did once in the book)so there is no reason to stay. I know many will disagree, but I found it just unbelievable. Read if you wish, but don't whine at the end. You've been warned.
B007N5YIUS|4.0|I only like it because of the adds, it's a little hard to concentrate when that add is bugging you.
B00992CF6W|5.0|It is a must bye game if you have a creative mind . Minecraft is one of the best games I have ever played I do not regret getting it
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|it's fun but the adds make it hard to concentrate. I like the fun noises the birds make and, the new level, red's mighty feathers, is really cool
B00526ZKYS|4.0|Quick read and fast paced. Love the story line but hated the ending. Can't wait til I read the next book.
B00CMQX84A|5.0|i thing that it is very cool i see this movie tree times and the movie dont will be see in mexico
B000O8OTNC|5.0|This one covers all of them<br />Serrated<br />straight<br />Really messed up or any other just needing to be restored to razor blade sharpness
B004SUWR2C|4.0|So far I haven't been disappointed. The Kindle Fire version is easy to understand and enjoyable to play. It would be a nice addition to your game library.
B0080SZ0V8|4.0|This is a simple but fun puzzle game. Only problem is many screens ard suited for larger screens.  Very small items to find or manipulate and is difficult to do on phone screens. Also does not zoom in enough to help. Otherwise.a decent game.
B0063M22QO|4.0|The Kindle Fire version of this game is very simple to use. The tiles are ornate and there are many different game configurations to play. Recommend!
B000W7JWUA|5.0|We were introduced to this game 2months ago and now we play at least twice a day.  It is so nice to be around the table with the family again.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I am a benevolent dictator. Do not fear me. You are a guest in my 8-bit kingdom. I will protect you from the zombies, skeleton, spiders, and spontaneously combusting trees. We shall revel in the majesty of my glorious domain and we shall cultivate farm animals and  build polychromatic monoliths throughout the land. We will make merry until the aforementioned interlopers return. At which time, I shall protect you again from the oh so familiar zombies, skeletons, spiders, and exploding trees,  which are not to be confused with our ever evolving arboretum. And you shall call me Lord Tyroneous and I shall call you Molly, which is the name of my ex-wife before she blasphemed her Lord and my realm and took the kids to her mom's place until her Lord \\"puts down the game and washes some goddang dishes.\\"  You are most welcome here as long as you do not blaspheme your Lord or nag about dishes or taking the trash out.
0743289692|5.0|A detailed leap into the world of fundamentalist Islam, Ayaan Hirsi Ali's Infidel begins with religious indoctrination under her family's Talal tree, we are \\"treated\\" to the horrors of religious indoctrination and the corporal punishment that invariably befell Ayaan and her sister should they fail to recite their lineages. This was crucial to their social lives in Africa, because all Muslims could be tied together by their common lineages, and they would need to know these implicitly in order to widen their cliques and circles.<br /><br />Although her mother was harsh, she was also affectionate, breaking into uncontrolled sobbing after Ayaan's suicide attempt at a young age. Sadly, the natural maternal affection between parent and child did not spare her from having her clitoris cut off (as Greta Christina accurately described). If that wasn't enough, she had to endure constant civil war and gunfire at all hours of the day. Such trauma could never leave young children unscarred. Her treatment at the lips of male Muslims during debate sessions was not much better. One can hardly expect much from a religion who treats women as expendable property (who cares if a 9-year-old bride dies during the consummation of her \\"marriage\\") and holds their testimony at half that of a man.<br /><br />Fortunately, things improve considerably for her when she leaves Kenya for the Netherlands. Incredulous at the modernity of the country, she falls instantly in love and obtains refugee status, working and assimilating herself into a new culture. Despite being ordered upon pain of being disowned to marry a man of her father's choosing, she stands up for her rights and convinces the clan elders to leave her be. Sadly, this leads to her father severing all ties with her.<br /><br />The autobiography concludes with a tragic summation of Theo van Gogh's murder and Ayaan's own escape to the United States, where she is under armed guard for leaving the religion of her birth, a faith she had no say in following. This is a true story of courage, struggle, self-assertion and the refusal to be silenced or intimidated by theocratic terrorists. A must-read.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is the best game ever it is better than temple run and temple run two I love this game it is my favorote game for sure
0399255370|5.0|Purchased this book for my young grandsons. I figured the 5 year old could read to his 2 year old brother and everyone would be happy. This book is just cute and the illustrations are wonderful. I read it before giving it to the boys and loved it. Enough subtle humor for an adult to enjoy.
1781162646|2.0|Highly padded: A short-story that rambles its way into a full-length book to sell.  Much repetition and spinning its narrative wheels.  \\"Move it along!\\" I kept thinking as I read it.
B0081336FO|4.0|Interaction of the main characters combined with the english locales and complex stories makes this series great fun and worth following
B00CWY76CC|5.0|It is a very interesting and exciting game that really made me think. It was very entertaining as well I recommend this game.
B008Y7N7JW|3.0|The book was much better. In the movie the characters were sallow and not well develop. If you did not read the book it will be hard to follow.
B00AZMFO6I|5.0|\\"Quartet\\" (2013)<br /><br />Dustin Hoffman's directorial debut is an entirely confident, measured, heartfelt and multi-layered drama-comedy situated in an old-folks home whose residents were top-flight music professionals - opera stars, orchestra members, etc. The cast is packed with classy A-list talent, actors such as Tom Courtenay, Michael Gambon and Maggie Smith, as well as a rambunctious Billy Connolly, who cheerfully steals scene after scene as a irrepressibly lecherous old-timer who was part of a legendary opera troupe. Also in the film are several \\"ringers,\\" real-life members of British royal orchestras and opera companies who play residents of the home, and who perform throughout the film. Hoffman's film explores issues of aging -- of lives piled high with lost loves, failing health and former glories -- but does so without belittling or trivializing the characters.  It's also a sweet celebration of art and creativity, and the kind of buoyant, intelligent personalities that make great art. The script and direction share a light, subtle touch, and the magnificent cast hit exactly the right tone, making this one of the most enjoyable, intelligent, mature films I've seen in a long time. Highly recommended! (DJ Joe Sixpack, Slipcue film reviews)
B00DHSK3RM|5.0|I just love this game,  I play it everyday.  No game like it. 5 stars,  if I could rate it 10, I would..♡♡♡
1451695195|5.0|After reading this book, I bought a few copies to give to family and friends who were willing to read it. I have NEVER DONE THAT BEFORE WITH ANY BOOK. It addressed questions I have had for a long time about the role of the brain shutting down, and that connection to near-death experiences reported by thousands of people. The book is written by an American nuerosurgeon who experienced the 'OTHER SIDE&#34; while laying in a coma for over a week, while being treated relentlessly by his medical friends. Made a believer out of me.
0545586178|5.0|Catching Fire continues the story with Catniss as the heroine in her home, District 12, and Peta, the hero, also from District 12.  He is in love with her, but she is unsure.  Gail, a boy she grew up with, is another possible love interest.  Gail and Catniss were saddled at a young age with feeding their families as young children by hunting in the forbidden forest.  I thought this book would be a Twilight deal where she wasn't sure if she was in love with Peta or Gail, etc.....  Boy, was I wrong.<br /><br />Catniss and Peta are showered with money after winning the Hunger Games, but their good fortune is only temporary.  Catniss gets a visit from the head of the Capitol and is told that her final act of the last Hunger Game (suicide attempt) was considered an act of rebellion.  Another Hunger Game is arranged.  This time it's a special game that includes the winners of the previous years going back decades with the same rules-winner is the only one left alive.<br /><br />This was my favorite of the series and probably one of my favorite books of all time.  Suzanne Collins' brilliance really rises to the top as she uses the Capitol's mounting oppression to push the country into a revolution.<br /><br />I don't want to give too much away because it's an exceptional book and highly recommend reading it.  The love triangle between Catniss, Gail, and Peta is only a subplot rather than the main plot.  This book is really about fighting for freedom.  Collins seems to depict the injustice of those who live in luxury while slave-like citizens struggle to eat.  Was she inspired by Les Miserables?  Is she slamming capitalism?  This book is an English teacher's dream: symbolism up the ying-yang, metaphors, similies, themes that matter, while raising the question-does capitalism promote freedom or encourage greed?<br /><br />Catniss emerges into a Joan of Arc type of character.  Peta doesn't die but doesn't escape the last round of Hunger Games.  He is one of my favorite male lead characters because he can be so raw without being wimpy.  He's sweet and thoughtful without being sappy.  He is kind without being weak.  He proves time and time again that he would die for Catniss even if she never feels the same way back.  Gail, on the otherhand, loves Catniss too, but he yearns for change and is ready to go to war rather than whine and cry about how bad things are.  5/5 Stars<br />[...]ead characters because he can be so raw without being wimpy.

B00DJFIMW6|1.0|Can't play :( Downloaded game, it plays a little movie, then gets stuck trying loading game. Wasted a lot of time for nothing.
0439023521|4.0|I read Hunger Games about a year ago, just before seeing the movie.  I enjoyed the book, but wasn't hungry to read the other two books in the series.  I wasn't sure if it was a teen romance, snub at reality TV, or political masterpiece.  The book, as all three books, was told through the eyes of sixteen year-old Catniss Everdeen, the main character who nobly takes her sister's place at the annual reaping.<br /><br />For those who aren't familiar with the movie or book, the story is about Catniss, the stand-up girl who takes her sister's place as a player in the annual Hunger Games.  The Games are kind of like a dark version of Survivor, the former TV show, except instead of an island the players are trapped inside of immense high-tech dome-arena.  The only way to win the game is to live with murder being a main part of game strategy.  To add more pressure onto the child contestants, the Capitol (government) controls the environment inside of the arena-dome through a computerized switchboard capable of changing the weather, creating a natural disaster, adding wild animals, and other ways to die.  Catniss does what she has to in order to survive.  At the end of the game she and Peta, a boy contestant from her hometown of District 12, refuse to kill each other.  They plan a double suicide while being filmed live on television, giving the book a Romeo-Juliet flavor.  At the last moment, the Capitol declares them both winners to save themselves from the bad publicity.  4.5/5 Stars
B0064X7FVE|4.0|Tired of stuff piping up all over the screen. Thought if I rated it at least one thing would be out of the way
0439023513|5.0|The last  book takes the Hunger Games out of the equation and puts the main characters, all young adults at this point, in a position of creating a brave new world.  This new world is the polar opposite of the extreme greed of the Capitol-a name that I highly doubt was chosen randomly.<br /><br />District 13 is the land of new beginnings and hope, the land where all of the fed-up citizens migrate to, the land that wants Catniss to be their spokesperson.  She reluctantly agrees since her friends that are still alive and her mother and sister have taken residency in the district.<br /><br />There are huge differences between the two different kinds of governments.  In the Capitol, the residents gorge on food and then force themselves to throw up in order to eat more while everyone else starves.  In District 13 everyone gets just enough of a food ration to survive.  The ration is based on their age and weight.  No one is allowed to hoard food.  Everyone wakes up at the same time, does the same chores, same training, wears the same clothes, and lives in the same kind of apartment.  Sound like communism?  Collins even tosses the word \\"comrade\\" around.<br /><br />While everyone is singing praises to the new District 13, Catniss smiles for the camera and spews propaganda all the while secretly wondering if the new boss is the same as the old boss.  Gail is very welcomed in the new district because of Catniss and gets his chance to overthrow the Capitol.  Peta, held prisoner in the Capitol, is brainwashed into thinking Catniss and District 13 are evil.  Can Catniss get him back to normal?  Overthrow the Capitol?  Does she wind up with Peta or Gail?  I'm not telling!  Read the book-you won't be disappointed!  5/5 Stars<br />[...]

B000F8O35U|5.0|This movie is my favorite Disney movie. It is different because it is about a mermaid and I love mermaids! The story line is great and so is the movie! It is for all ages and it is a movie you can watch over and over again! I highly recommend this movie to any one who likes Disney or mermaids!

034580709X|5.0|This book is better than the Stieg Larsen trilogy.  Be sure to put his Harry Hole series on your must read list.
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|Well did not disappoint, as good as the last, except for the ending can't wait for the follow-up. I know with that it should be off the hook.
B00AQ71FLK|3.0|The game is great love all aspects of it, there's only a few problems. The servers are constantly being disconnected, and while a game starts the game shuts me out all together.  Was working great but now it's being slow and keeps shutting me out.
B000IZ36J4|5.0|Loved the book and loved the movie!!  It followed the book very well.  I didn't really like that Catherine and Cathy were the same actress but I understand the producers wanting to keep their faces the same.
B004UID2LC|1.0|I loved this app...loved. then the update came along I ignore the update and let it happen like every other app I have. It was normal for a while then eventually the videos I downloaded switched names with the one below it. All the videos ended up being deleted since it said for every one of them that the file didn't exist. Later on I thought was something I did so I thought maybe I should try again. The videos I chose ended being deleted while they were downloading. All because the app said YouTube downloader stopped working. I tried one last time to open it but it wouldn't open at all so I was forced to delete it all together. I re-downloaded the app hoping it would work the it used to. But the same problems stemmed again. Deletion mid download, YouTube stopping, wouldn't open, and recently made my other apps stop working. It was the best app I've ever used, used to watch pewdiepie all the time but can't do so now. I looked at all the other YouTube apps but they had bad reviews, and the reviews that were good were the only ones there, the rest were bad. Telling me that the creators were the ones that created those reviews. All in all I will never find and app that was better than this on was. I hope from the bottom of my YouTube loving heart that they fix this problem so we the ppl can freely use YouTube once more without problems setting us back.
B0026QC0TA|4.0|I read the book and the movie rarely captures all you get from the book, but I enjoyed both movie and book.

B0049P1ZZQ|5.0|All I can say is it's the best tv show ever it keeps you on the edge of your seat and when an episode is over you can't wait til the next episode. Movie quality production and special effects !!!!
1451695195|3.0|Good book, with fascinating story, but the plethora of medical descriptions made it a boring in spots.  Easily put down.
B009NQZVKG|5.0|If you are up to date with the Sigma series, then this is a must read.  This might be the best one yet.  The level of detail that goes into his stories is impeccable and it is told in a way that is easy to understand as you are deeper into the story.  This book has plenty of suspense and action and the ending is just awesome!
B002L5KKK2|5.0|A strong script and story, beautiful characterizations and straight-forward cinematography that doesn't needlessly call attention to itself makes this coming-of-age story, written by Chazz Palminteri and directed by Robert De Niro a real winner. See it!

A story of a tenacious hiker that puts her mind to the task and makes it all happen, blisters be damned!
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Great story line, Superb cast! Shirley Maclaine shoud have stayed longer though! All in all, great season, I finished it in one day! (Wish there were more than 9 episodes!)
B000QRIGLC|5.0|Marcus Luttrel is the lone survivor of an outnumbered Seal Team fighting for their lives at altitude near the Pakistani border. A big battle, warriors all and an excellent read.  Definitely one of the best, if not the best, Seal Team narratives I've read!  Makes you proud to be an American!
0446672653|5.0|This book gives hope to those who have yet to find a special someone or have met and lost someone special. It gives confidence in knowing that you're fine the way you are and that, with faith, all will be well. It is very comforting to know that loved ones can repeat in several lifetimes.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|Chris Kyle is a legend and his book tells the story of big bore, long distance justice!  A great read by a true hero!
B00005JLRT|5.0|After 730 reviews, there is probably not much to add, so I'll keep it short and sweet. Nemesis is BY FAR the single best Trek movie in the entire Trek franchise!  Full stop, end of discussion.
B00E0S52K6|5.0|Love, love, love it!  A terrific mix of Buddy's life story, wit and amazing blues playing.  Great guest appearances too (you can't miss with Beth Hart as a sidekick).  I see another Grammy coming.

B00D41AJ7G|4.0|The concept is a 5 star! Love the different patterns and tools. Figuring out the sequence was really fun. But I had the app for 3 days and finished the whole thing. There needs to be more levels, or something...
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Sylvia Day can spin a story. Cannot wait until the 4th and 5th books are published. I even like like him better than Christian. He seems stronger and moe invested in Eva.<br /><br />They are both struggling with similar issues. Hope it becomes a movie!
B00709GTGS|4.0|The film is great but we were unable to view this particular disc as it is zoned for USA only.
B009NQZVKG|4.0|It started so strong and then it seemed to go to formula. The characters didn't grow in this book. Good science info.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|This is one of the better bingos. Five free games everyday...no one else gives that. Since I have a number of bingo games...it is nice to get to play everyday and not have to spend my money to do that with a free game. Most bingo games make you save their coins everyday until you can play a game.
B005H9B2CE|5.0|It's a good watch, cool scenes and doesn't get old quick. I would recommend it for sure,  somewhat of a chick Flick
B009UNGYHG|4.0|The case is very compact and well desiged. For someone like me that it's always traveling  and just tosse it in the bag it your headset will be very well protected.
030014332X|5.0|It is a must read as a summer read for an introduction to the history for high school sophomores! Highly recommend the book to students!
1423117166|5.0|A beautiful book.. A history of Disney's drawings and well put together giving a glimpse into the creativity behind the Disney movies.
B008BQ8VOC|5.0|This show is very addicting and I can watch it all day and not get tired of it. I hope it goes on for few more seasons.
