B003JBI2KM|5.0|This is a great book and the hard copy version I purchased has helped make me a better home brewer. I give it five stars but I'm not going to pay $10.99 for the Kindle version. Amazon says the publisher set the price on this Kindle version. Does the author get more of a cut from the e-version since there are no overhead costs printing an electronic copy or is the publisher just raking in obscene profits?
B007PTJOV0|5.0|This game is just like Mario Bros. I love it!<br />This game is awesome. Everyone should get this game.<br />Repeat. I love this game!
0345803485|5.0|I loved this book. I didn't understand what all the fuss was about by the media calling it \\"mommy porn\\" or \\"erotica\\"... seriously?? Anyone who has experimented in their relationship, outside of the normal \\"vanilla\\" positions and/or \\"vanilla language\\" would not be offended by the language used or the sexual situations. Likewise,anyone secure in their sexuality would not need to hide the fact that they are reading this book. It is not only about tawdry sex. It is about what Christian went through / is going through that made him who he is and Anastasia is unwittingly enchanting him to further experience outside of his twisted norms because he falls for her. The book is made to realize how each character is willing to compromise for the other. It is witty, the banter between them is funny as hell, and the tone of the book is SO much more than just sex. It is a very engaging and powerful read. you will not want to put it down until you finish it.

B0071XO8RA|5.0|Excellent writing and story line development... really tickled to see that the next gen of sic fi writers is so blessed with talent.. I was afraid the best of the best wrote in the 40s to 60s but this author shows there is  another golden age of sci fi ahead!  Looking forward to reading every book he writes!
0307269752|5.0|I purchased this book when it first came out, then was excited for the movie. The book was so much better than the movie with details and story building. An intelligent read.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I try to keep up with what's hot in books and movies - but I truly couldn't get past the stupidity and masochism hinted at in the chapter where she enters his \\"torture\\" chamber of a bedroom. I wish some of this creepy stuff would have appeared in the Kindle sample I downloaded.  I never would have paid the price for this book. I did realize, in the first couple of chapters, that it wasn't very well written. It makes references to the heroine being a fan of British novels and the Classics but there is nothing classical or magical or even good about this author's abilities.  Who says \\"That's very profligate of you\\" in a normal discussion?  And all the gasping and hitching of breaths, and inability of the heroine to take a breath before they've even kissed is so \\"teenager\\" geared that it scares me.  I hope that it sets no new standard, along side the current vampire garbage, for young women to think this behavior is in any way \\"ok\\" to explore.

B005ELZNH0|5.0|This collection is priceless. With the exception of some early things not on Columbia (only Birth of the Cool stands out to me), this includes some, though not all, of this icon's greatest materials. Miles is the history of Jazz. He played all forms, was always on the cutting edge, or so close he seemed to be at the forefront.This 20 album  (22 disc) set is a very thorough recapturing of his glory days (the best days) at Columbia. It has the classic Columbia Davis- Gil Evans material,  KInd of Blue, and the Davis - Shorter/ Bitches Brew bands.  I can't think of a bad choice in the collection. (Now I am not a great fan of Star People or Decoy, but on listening to them again - which I did as I played this whole collection disc after disc- have to admit I enjoyed each.)  This collection is a great value, and its a great gift for anyone new to jazz, or a quick way to get a lot of Miles even if only some of these in the are missing from your collection!  Do the math! These discs are cheap - buy the set give your original duplicates away! (I leave all my original duplicates in the car or at the office.)  And while everyone does not agree: I like the additional bonus tracks - adding to the length of any classic cd never bothers me, so long as the original tracks are intact. Just because the company put them on the cd does not mean you have to play them - program them out if you don't like them! This set is a rare find: true classic material, presented in a  very nice package, at a very affordable price.  Add the Birth of the Cool, from Amazon of course, and its really all the Miles you need. (But I'll bet you'll buy more, but if not, this is all that is required.)
B000RPTQ1C|4.0|This cd by Coldplay is a classic so when building our music collection, this cd was a must and are very happy to have it now in our music collection.

B007Q2N0HA|5.0|Ok, I will admit it.  I love Sylvia Day.  I've read tons of her books and they're some of the few paperbacks I kept after getting my kindle a few years ago.  So, it's not really a surprise that I loved this story, too.  (My heart is still a little bit in my throat as I write this review, actually.)  Gideon and Eva are complicated, but endearing.  I was rooting for them all the way.  And Cary, Eva's best friend, was character perfection.  I hope his story gets told as well, I know it will be a good read.  I am wishing I knew the release date of the next book in this series because I am dying for the rest of their story...<br />Edited to add: The author has stated she hopes to have the next book in the series out in October 2012. *happy dance*
1846555221|5.0|I couldn't wait to get this book & then like with all his books I inhaled it & then when I got to the end I was crushed. \\"Oh no\\", I thought, it can't be, but I think it is, the end of this series. But there are so many corrupt guys still out there, I wanted them all to get what was coming to them, but will there be a conclusion without Harry, I think not. There were plenty of twists & turns just like always, I have read the whole series & will not resell them because I know I will read them again, just like with Steig Larsson. I along with plenty of others wonder why the author chose to retire Harry for want of a better word, especially when we all waited for every book with baited breath. But I think, as with all authors all the time they can conjure up a story easily & then turn it in to a best seller it's fun, but when they have exhausted all the possibilities then it's time for them to move on to new characters & scenarios. So I wait to see what Jo does next & hopefully whatever it is we won't have to wait too long before it's translated in to English.
B005ER6SNM|4.0|Absolutely horrifying and brutal, but also has something important to say beyond what is seen on the surface. I think there will be different interpretations of this movie's message for different people, but it's still there if you can get past the shock of what you're seeing. When people are this angered and outraged by a movie, that is not real, how is it possible that we can ever truly comprehend and understand the atrocities that are committed against our fellow human beings on a daily basis- any age, any race, any gender, social status, etc. We can't. It's easier for us to write scathing reviews of a movie like this,calling it foul and disgusting and trying to have it banned, than actually stopping to think about the real violence that's going on in this world and being shocked and appalled by that instead.<br /><br />The only thing about the movie that is 'negative', of course, is how extreme the violence gets, because a majority of people will focus on that instead of the message of it, but I think it HAD to be like that, how else could the director really have gotten anyone's attention? It's not violence for violence's sake, as other reviewers have said. I personally think it's trying to be a bit of a wake up call. We've all become so desensitized by violence that things that should shock us don't. The only way to really get anyone's attention in this manner is to put it right in front of them and say \\"You want violence? I'll show you what REAL violence is like-here it is. Not pretty, is it?\\"<br /><br />Aside from the social commentary, this is actually a well directed and well acted movie. You care about Milos and what is going to happen to him and his family, and you feel the panic and terror he does as things get progressively worse. Also, the music was perfect, it built up right along with the movie. Would I ever watch this again? No. This is a movie to be watched once, and remembered forever.
B00005V1Y0|4.0|When I realized this was the movie that I had seen some few years ago, I had to have it. It arrived in great fashion and it was just as enjoyable as the first time that I had watched it with my little sister. I am glad that I was able to find it and would certainly look for others in the same genre.
B0018QOIXU|5.0|Well, this is a cd that's needs no review. If you love Adele you have heard this and if you don't own it yet you are probably one of the few left on the planet who doesn't lol. Always great for dinner party music when not relaxing listening to it on my own. Melts the stress away.

B005HV6Y84|2.0|When I watched the movies I listened to the music that was played. I wanted the music that was on the movies themselves. I was a little disappointed that the music that was on the CD was more of just random stuff that was sounded at the ending credits or not at all through out any of the films. The one that I caught right away was the last song on the CD which was Bella's song. That was one of the pieces that I was after. I think the music is OK, but I am one who wants to purchase the music directly from the movies. I am spoiled from those such as the Ghostbuster's soundtrack.

1455508977|3.0|Very strong well paced narrative. Detailed yet easy and stimulating read until it starts raining (literally, about 2/3 through) and that seems to wash away any interesting plot and character development. A solid 5-star book falls to a weak 3-star exercise in cliche novel climax faster than you can turn on the windshield wipers.

B0072GPPNC|4.0|\\"War Horse\\": Beautiful cinematography, excellent musical score, stunning production design, some great \\"Spielberg\\"-type moments and a memorable performance by Joey (horse)...unfortunately, the script is dull, cliched and sometimes, down-right corny.<br /><br />I thought the beginning was slow and the relationship, between the boy and Joey, wasn't developed strong enough for me to care of when they had to be separated.<br /><br />I didn't think the film was interesting, until the war began. The war scenes were well shot and rather exciting (and a little surprisingly, more violent than I'd expect). There's a special moment, towards the end of the film, where in the midst of war, Joey is able to temporarily, hault the bloodshed of the two sides.<br /><br />The exchanging of Joey's \\"ownership\\" throughout the film, in some cases, is kind of boring. It only really gets really sad, when with the Germans, near the end: There is a heartbreaking scene, involving another horse, that really makes you wish horses weren't really treated that way in wars.<br /><br />As a Spielberg film, it's not one of his best. It has the look and sometimes, feel of an epic masterpeice, but the script\pacing is what holds it back. There are certainly, classic moments\images in the film, but it's not enough to forgive the dis-jointed narrative.<br /><br />It's a good film, but not \\"Best Picture\\" great.
B007MNV5WU|5.0|I loved this game. Its like a new game. Besides there were two levels Its fantastic! Though I was dissapointed that I defeated it.
B005LL4U54|5.0|The movie was outstanding!  We really liked the music and this album has all the music from the movie.  Listening to the disc brings back the scenes in the movie.  The music is great--all of it!
B0063GORYU|5.0|Challenging time waster.  I don't get but one add pop up when you first open up the game. Would like to see it be just a bit snappier on the tap.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This is a wonderful tool to have. I have it on my phone & my Kindle Fire. I love the fact that it can now read aloud as there are times when my eyes just keep jumping around on the page but when I use the read aloud moore I can close my eyes and focus on the words. Thanks YouVersion!
B0075564A8|5.0|There's much to be said about \\"In Bed With Madonna\\" aka \\"Truth or Dare\\" but I won't get into the details of the film, seeing as there are already a couple of great reviews. An inside look at the grueling demands of a world tour in 1990, you see how the biggest pop star in the world at the moment handled the stress, fatigue, and let-downs of the rockstar life.<br /><br />Britney Spears tried it with [[ASIN:097245750X Britney Spears: Stages with DVD]] and Lady Gaga emulated it with [[ASIN:B005SV9X22 Lady Gaga Presents The Monster Ball Tour At Madison Square Garden [Explicit]]], but the rawness of the touring lifestyle was best showcased in Truth or Dare.<br /><br />We get to see the real Madonna: a strong-headed and witty perfectionist who takes her craft extremely serious. This documentary easily shows why this woman has had the success and accolades she has received. You can't expect success and global domination to just come to you and you take the Easy Ride [pun intended :)]- she shows that you have to work for it and once you get it, it's much more difficult to maintain.<br /><br />I have never had more respect for a woman in showbusiness- Madonna is a true philanthropist, nurturer, and most importantly someone who never pretended to be something she wasn't.<br /><br />Long live the queen.
B005FITIF0|5.0|That was a very good movie,.  I think that was one Gerard Butler's best movies. He did a GREAT job.  The makes you award just how bad it is over there in Sudan.  I highly recommned it to everybody.

B007J4T2G8|4.0|About the content ... The book was ok. It held my attention so that's a feat! The ending seemed rushed and about 75% through, it seemed too repetitive. But, it is a page turner, so I gave it 4 stars.<br /><br />About the publisher... WHAT!?!? I can't loan it??? Shame on you greedy publishers. I can't resell ebooks? I can't loan this one? I may stop my experiment with ebooks and go back to buying used books and then giving them away.<br /><br />AMazon.... It would be nice if I knew I couldn't loan this book. I certainly wouldn't have bought it. One read is NOT worth paying full price to the publisher. This is why people learn to bootleg copy written material - too many restrictions!!?
B005LAIH3G|4.0|Definitely, Disney should fire who ever was in charge of promoting this movie. As a matter of fact, the first big mistake was the title of the movie itself, because it should have been \\"John Carter of Mars\\" at least. \\"John Carter\\" as a title does not tell you much if you have not read the books before. The movie is lots of fun, the special effects are very good, the characters are not complicated and it's easy to like them, and the story is light and fun. I would like to see it again because I had a great time like everybody else at the movie theater. However, the marketing for this movie has been a catastrophe and many people will miss this fun movie. Kudos for those who were in charge of promoting \\"the Hunger Games\\" movie because they've reached a lot for a movie that is just average and won't motivate you to see it again. So if you want to spend two hours and minutes having fun, go and see \\"John Carter\\" or get the DVD, I guarantee you that you won't be disappointed. In regards of \\"the Hunger Games\\" only if you are a teen you will think it's a great movie...a teenager also thinks the Twilight movies are good, and we know they are only average at best.

0553801473|2.0|Like most of us who are huge fans of the series, this book demonstrated an author who needs to learn less is more and for us fans for having set expectations higher than was fair. Saying all that the book was a huge disappointment and I am done with this series.
B003L20IHE|1.0|I was very unhappy with my purchase. The seller listed the DVD as \\"like new\\". It was a Blockbuster movie rental which is hardly new!  They have been viewed many, many times and the case was scratched up without art. I paid $7.48 for the DVD including shipping and was able to buy a brand new DVD at Best Buy for $9.99 with free shipping! It's worth the extra couple bucks to get a much higher quality DVD.

B000C20VPA|5.0|What are the odds? Casino is a classic Las Vegas gangster film directed by Martian Scorsese. In one word Casino is: Awesome. It stars the dynamic duo of Robert De Niro and Joe Pecsi. This team made a number of great movies together, this arguably the best of the bunch.  Casino tells the story of Las Vegas: how it started and also how it ended. Robert De Niro plays Sam \\"Ace\\" Rothstein. Rothstein is a gambling extraordinaire mob backed Casino manager. His attention to detail is extensive to say the least. Throughout the film Sam explains the ins and outs of the Casino business in old school Las Vegas. Joe Pesci plays Rothstein's psychotic, visceral, and violent right hand man Nicky Santoro. Pesci really hit the mark on this one. Nicky is one of the most violent mobsters in film history.  His attitude is so over the top he leaves you terrified in your seat. Casino also includes a star studded cast of excellent players including: Sharon Stone (plays Ginger, Ace's wife, a role that earned her a Golden Globe Award for Best Actress and a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Actress), Frank Vincent, Don Rickles, James Woods, and many others. To top it off Frankie Avalon plays the one and only Frankie Avalon. This film is full of great music, style, and ultimately many life lessons. It was made at the right time in the right way by Martin Scorsese. Casino is a timeless classic. Depending on your point your view: it will make you long for old Vegas or appreciate the Disney Land is has become. Take your pick just be careful when you driving around there in the desert. According to this film, there's a lot of stuff buried out there.
B005NPBT5M|1.0|Amaxon does it again.  It is grouping the comments from ..... The Wall - Immersion Box Set, The Wall (2011 - Remaster MP3), The Wall (2011 - Remaster), The Wall (2000), and The Wall- Experience Version together as one review.  The comments are all the same for each product.  So someone is complaining that the movie is not included with the Experience Version - well, it is not supposed to be.  It is a two CD set.  That is all.  How confusing for someone who is looking for what they want.  What is Amaxon doing or better yet, why are they doing it this way?  There should be a different review for each bar coded version.  With all this distortion, I am just going to keep my original version and save my money.  The Sony version still sounds great!
B000A7DVR2|5.0|Jeff Bridges as you've never seen him before in this Coen brothers masterpiece. When the \\"dude\\" Lebowski (Bridges) is mistaken for a millionaire, also named Lebowski (David Huddleston), the dude seeks compensation for his ruined rug. He is given short shrift by the wealthy Lebowski. What follows is a typically quirky Coen brothers movie. One of my favourite films of all time and also one of the most quotable movies of all time! Although due to the language there is little I can quote here!<br /><br />Bridges is supported by Steve Buscemi and John Goodman who plays his short tempered friend Walter Sobchak. If you're already a fan of the Coen brothers and this movie has somehow passed you by then I urge you to complete your collection with this corker of a film. If you have an open mind, don't mind a bit of swearing and enjoy bowling you'll love The Big Lebowski.
B0058VA2U4|5.0|I'm a bit partial to Anthrax as you could see my 5 star rating. So this being said, there are a few tracks that are better than others.  As with any album, you have favorites like in the end, and I'm alive.  Overall I would buy the album again if I lost this one.  Would love to see them live.

B00006FDCJ|5.0|This is a western for the ages set in late nineteen century Montana.<br /><br />A saloon girl is beaten and knife-cut. Her coworkers are angry but the sheriff (Gene Hackman) does not want to do much about it. Her coworkers put up a thousand dollar reward to obtain justice, but the reward only draws undesirables and brings trouble to Big Whiskey, Montana.<br /><br />Clint Eastwood, Morgan Freeman and Richard Harris join forces in an effort to obtain the reward money. After the setting, the story is mainly about the confrontation within the trio and the sheriff and the values that emerge considering that the gun is mainly law.<br /><br />Disc two is about 'the making of' and a considerable data base of Clint Eastwood movies. Included is an episode from \\"Maverick\\" starring James Garner and a very young Clint Eastwood.<br /><br />\\"Unforgiven\\" belongs next to \\"High Noon\\". It is that good.
B00005K3NR|5.0|When did you first decide to stand up for yourself? From the opening scenes Carries is an American classic. There were many talented individuals involved in the creation of this gem. It is a classic film directing achievement. It is a classic literary achievement. To top it off it is also a classic acting achievement. Put all this talent together and you have a movie that set a lasting standard in the history of film. Carrie was directed by the great Brian De Palma in 1976. It was based on the novel Carrie by Stephen King. This was a situation that involved two masters working at the top of their respective games.  A person can say all they want about the film Carrie. If you have watched it you will never forget it. When you watch it now all the terror will return. Anyone that has lived or breathed the culture of the American individual can understand the story. Carrie is an original outsider. She is played with legendary grace by Sissy Spacek. She is confused, misguided, innocent, and ultimately hated. Carrie is essentially pushed by life directly over the edge. This was a theme of many early Stephan King novels that the film captured perfectly. The dissociation of the American teenager. On the surface this is a horror film. The truth is it's actually about life.  In the story Carrie must feel guilt for everything, even what she does not understand. The horrific outcome at the end is symbolic for all the rage a person could ever feel. The point is that no matter how ridiculous, hateful, delusional, or judgmental this world may be: a person can always find the strength to stand up for themselves and make their way. Carrie is very thoughtful film with timeless themes about the eternal struggle of the individual.

B006BG7RI0|5.0|Who are you really, and what were you before? What did you do and what did you think, huh?<br />Casablanca. 1942. Defines old school classic. It was directed by Michael Curtiz, starring Humphrey Bogart, Ingrid Bergman and Paul Henreid, and featuring Claude Rains, Conrad Veidt, Sydney Greenstreet, Peter Lorre and Dooley Wilson. This movie has a plot that appears to be simple but could possibly be more complicated then life itself.<br />The great Humphrey Bogart plays Rick. Rick owns a bar in Morocco during World War II called Rick's Cafe. This bar & casino is frequented by shady characters from all over Europe. Most of these individuals are looking for one of three things: a drink, freedom, or love. One random night it all changes when Rick's old squeeze walks in and brings all the familiar feelings with her. The only problem is that this ain't no ordinary girl. She is beautiful and she is directly connected to the resistance. Love or liberty? This film asks the big questions in a fun way. It is still going strong today and you certainty don't need special effects to see why. You can practically smell the booze and feel the heartache. Watch it then, watch it now, and watch it tomorrow: Casablanca is as cool as they come.<br /><br />Of all the gin joints in all the towns in all the world, she walks into mine.

B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Awesome, spell bounding, terrific.  You have to buy the trilogy because you will not be able to stop with the first book.  The heroine in the story is so brave but so humble too.  But she has a spirit and love for others that cannot be denied.  And her determination to protect those she loves at all cost proves it.  This story really makes you think what kind of world we could possibly be leaving to our grandchildren.  It is frightening to think about but maybe it is time to have a dose of reality.  It is a game between the haves and the have nots.

B007PTJOV0|5.0|this is a great game don't you here it calling you?<br /><br />they bribe you to give it 5 stars but this game is awesome bribe or not
B000QGAU4E|5.0|I had to view this film for a class and was prepared to be bored for nearly 2 hours. As soon as the first bomb went off this movie had me hooked. I loved this film. It made me laugh at the great chemistry between Clive Owens and Michael Caine as well as Clive Owens and the lead girl. It made me cry Michael Caine's beautiful move to save mankind. I can't believe I did not see this movie sooner. It is wonderfully made with great close ups and use of sound. I highly recommend this movie to anybody no matter what genre of film that appeals to them. Wonderful job!
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|My only wish is that I didn't have to keep waiting for my energy to build back up. I adore games where you have to build, collect, and maintain, and this is a really cute one.
B005FITIGO|3.0|To somebody very familiar with investing, money management and Wall Street politics, this movie will be interesting especially considering the fine acting talents involved.<br /><br />To the average citizen who is not familiar with economics, this movie will no doubt be as boring as watching paint dry.<br /><br />The problem ?<br /><br />The movie really does nothing more than show people stressing out over seeing their high flying way of life come to an end.<br /><br />There is no good detail or explanation of how financial models and the world of investing really work for the general audience.<br /><br />I feel failing to really scrape beneath the surface and tell the whole story will leave many viewers lost and clueless as to what is really happening most of the time.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|this game is fun,  but similar to super Mario bros. its simpler,  but still very addictive. definitely want to keep playing
0553801473|4.0|As the 5th book in the Song of Ice and Fire series, Dance with Dragons may very well be the final expansion item in the series. This is not a bad thing per-se: it means that if you understand the pattern of the books, the story has not only progressed a great degree but the scope of it has gotten bigger and bigger and bigger. Whereas the first book focused strictly on the perspectives of the Starks, Tyrion, and Daenerys, the second book brought in Theon and Davos, the third book brought in Samwell and Jaime, the forth book brought in Brienne, Cersei, the Greyjoys, the Soiled Knight of the Kingsguard, The Dornish Guard Captain, and Reek. Now the 5th book, the story being told in parallel with A Feast For Crows, brought in the main characters back, caught up with the awesome ending that book, and then continued forward. And yet, as the story has progressed and expanded at the same time, it remains manageable, compelling, character-centered, thought-provoking, and a sound emotional mix ranging from frustration with people you hate, and gratification with people you love.<br /><br />I do have a theory about why there are so many 1 and 2 star reviews. Maybe it's because this story has drifted well outside the comfort zone of many readers and they simply weren't ready for it. By now, you the reader have been consumed into this world that is clearly bigger than you, and this story does require some serious comprehension. And I guess given the shallowness of mainstream books like Twilight and the Seinfeld-Banya rivalry, people prefer material they don't have to think about.<br /><br />And that's just unfortunate, because a quality story like the one told in Feast for Crows and Dance With Dragons, both of which given a long and drawn out 2nd act, really does deserve to be told and it deserves to be credited with thought and intrigue. The series has been amazing thus far, and unlike most others, I have embraced this difference. Here is a book series that immersed me into a world that doesn't even exist, and I am now torn on several sides, trying to figure out how best to rule and control it and how I would sort this political mess out. And because there is just so much there, to the point where fantasizing about acquiring the powers of Superman and warping into the world so I can kill who I want, save who I want, and fix everything is literally an impossible task. That the only purpose in my reading of these books is because I am desperate to see what happens next and I just want to see how it ends. There is no book series that has ever done that to me. And that's what makes Song of Ice and Fire valuable, particularly Dance With Dragons.<br /><br />Now maybe after all that, you're all wondering why I gave this book 4 stars and not 5. I only give something 5 stars if I think it is either flawless or its flaws are so tiny that they aren't even worth mentioning as flaws. In this case, I was a little disappointed with a couple of the character arcs in this book - particularly Bran. He's in the beginning of the book, and then a little later, there's this absolutely epic moment that I will not spoil that has to do with him, but after that...nothing. Bran has gotten cooler and cooler throughout the story and I really wanted to see more of him, but I guess that's material for the 6th book and this story was largely centered around Daenerys. This is understandable, but also a little disappointing because even her story was a little stagnant. There was plenty there, but there was a lot of nothing happening, followed by one also crazy and epic moment that really changes things but it's not something you'd be expecting and it has somewhat rendered what were/are my ultimate hopes for her, irrelevant. Not to say necessarily that what happened was bad, just that now I'm a little lost and I'm still trying to wrap my mind around it.<br /><br />But rest assured, Dance With Dragons is a stellar installment in the series and deserves your read.

B0034G4P4O|3.0|I was EXTREMELY impressed with the \\"quasi-realistic\\" computer animation style introduced and used by this movie.<br />For that alone, I give the movie 6+ stars.<br /><br />Despite this, the movie itself lost our interest after about 30 minutes.<br /><br />Instead of any real adventure story, the movie felt like one \\"falling dominoes\\" or \\"fancy mousetrap\\" scene after another strung together.<br />By \\"falling dominoes\\", I mean those scenes that are set up where ladders fall, throw a bucket in the air, dog lands in bucket, bucket floats down waterfall, etc.. etc...<br /><br />Instead of telling a story, the scenes BEAUTIFULLY RENDERED AS THEY WERE, simply felt like exercises in manipulating computer animation with as crazy and looney scenes as possible.<br /><br />At the end of the movie, I actually felt bad for not liking the movie more.<br /><br />I mean there is TONS of hard work and talent that goes into manipulating modern computers and pixels to create such a visually impressive movie.<br />That deserves respect.<br /><br />How many nameless ans faceless people spent late hours working on this visually impressive piece of art.<br />People will remember the names Spielberg and Jackson, but what about all those dozens of CGI guys behind them that REALLY did the hard work ?<br /><br />As it ends up, as impressive as the computer animation was .... the movie felt lifeless and dull.<br /><br />I would much prefer to see a detailed and in-depth documentary on the full process of how a movie like this is made from scratch.<br /><br />I actually think such a documentary would be much more interesting than the movie itself.
0871404133|5.0|E.O.Wilson has finally exposed the creator of man- GROUP SELECTION-.  E.O.Wilson will go down in history as the second greatest evolutionary biologist next to Darwin. Like Darwin he has opened our eyes and allowed us to see our own creation.  Wilson hopes humankind will enter a new enlightenment I ALSO hope we can enter a new ENLIGHTENMENT. The great majority of evolutionary biologists reject group selection for various reasons. Even Richard Dawkins discounts group selection as a weak force. Yet he explains chromosomes as a group of genes rowing together in a boat. I am an amateur evolutionary biologist who has long believed in group selection. The human condition is now known. Many will reject it but like Darwin E.O.Wilson will prevail.  Einstein once said: \\" The problems we face today cannot be solved at the same level of thinking at which they were created.\\" Wilson has moved thinking to a higher level. This book is a must read for everyone who wishes to think at a higher level'

0345803485|1.0|Reading this book is like watching a car crash: You know that for your own good and well-being you need to look away immediately, but some sick desire to know what happens keeps your eyes peeled until they're scarred forever.<br /><br />I honestly do not understand the uproar around this book. I can sum it up for you like this: Christian Grey smirks. Anastasia Steele bites her lip. Christian Grey says jump. Anastasia Steele goes through the \\"intelligent\\" woman facade of trying to assert her independence, and then says how high. No questions get answered. And by the end if you don't want to wear Converse, drive an Audi, and strangle the inner goddess, then I don't know what to tell you.<br /><br />I know Anastasia is the poor man's Bella Swan, which is apt because the entire time you're thinking, \\"What's so great about Anastasia Steele?\\" Everyone tells her that she's gorgeous, intelligent, witty, etc., and every man in the book falls in love with her, but outside of their assertions there is no evidence to back it up. She's rarely funny. Hardly ever endearing. During a particularly violent turn in which she's about to be beaten, her biggest concern when forced into headphones is, \\"Jeez, I hope it's not rap.\\" She's singularly unappealing as a heroine, and not nearly clever enough to carry off an entire book.<br /><br />I forced myself to finish this one, but that's as far as my masochistic streak will take me. Do yourself a favor and skip it altogether.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I had heard reviews of this book on the Today show and thought I would read it.  I ended up really enjoying the book.  The story line caught my interest right away.

B0042J6VUS|1.0|This is a cheap little tripod made out of plastic. It broke within 2 minutes of trying to screw an iPhone onto it. The little plastic screw (that is suppose to screw into the camera) is glued in place and you have to twist the camera round and round. Even so, the little plastic leg (no sturdier than a straw) would not support the weight of an iPhone and completely broke. The tripod only cost about $15 but it is a complete and total waste of money. Do not buy this piece of trash.

145162445X|5.0|This is one of the best books I have read in recent years that summarizes the laws of physics and the origin of the universe in a splendid manner. The author describes as how our universe was created out of nothing; just an empty space with virtual particles using quantum physics and relativity without invoking string or brane theories.<br /><br />Moments after the big bang, a slight asymmetry in the distributions of matter and antimatter resulted in our universe. This asymmetry was extremely minute, one part in a billion, which means that there were approximately one billion photons for every proton (matter) in the universe, which is still found in the cosmic microwave background radiation (CMBR), remnants of the glow of early universe; the moment after matter-antimatter annihilation occurred. The essence of the book is that the application of the laws of quantum physics and relativity to physical reality produces facts that stun common sense. The reader begins to appreciate the author's argument and the physical laws that support it. The author also has a humorous look at the nature of things while discussing strangeness of quantum physics. At several instances he jabs at politicians, leaders of corporations, and men who profess to preach God, with hard facts of physics.<br /><br />A summary of the book is as follows: When a balloon gets blown up larger and larger at a fast pace, the curvature at its surface gets smaller and smaller, closer to being flat.  A similar mechanism called inflation lead the early universe into a long lived universe removing all its curvature. The cosmic inflation is a period rapid of exponential expansion of our universe, moments after its birth. As the energy of empty space is converted into the energy of something, the universe was driven closer and closer to being essentially flat on all observable scales. Secondly, the laws of quantum physics imply on very small scales for very short times, empty space is a boiling bubbling brew of virtual particles with wildly fluctuating fields. These quantum fluctuations ended the period of exponential expansion during inflation. That is, different regions of the early universe stopped inflating at slightly different times and the density of matter and radiation were slightly different. These small fluctuations in the density of matter resulted in gravitational collapse to form galaxies, and later stars.  It is the quantum fluctuations of empty space, the quantum nothingness that evolved into cosmos. If a closed universe had been created (with curvature); it would have collapsed on its own gravity, leaving nothing. A flat universe mediated by inflationary expansion led to a long lived universe.<br /><br />Virtual universes that pop in and out of existence, within a very short time, are interesting theoretical constructs. The virtual photons carry zero energy, and they do not violate energy conservation or Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle. Hence the formation of virtual particles from empty space is in accordance with laws of physics. The dynamics and the nature of things are not as simple as they appear from Newtonian laws of physics. For example, when an object is moving through space, the space itself evolves with time and the terms of present and future becomes relative and not absolute, according to relativistic physics, and the laws of quantum physics applies not only to physical properties of objects but space itself.<br /><br />The phenomenon of Hawking-radiation applies quantum physics to a classical entity such as black hole and this study reveals that a black hole can radiate virtual particles. Due to quantum fluctuation in its vicinity, just outside the event horizon, one of the partner particle falls inside the event horizon and loose its gravitational energy; the other partner particle will fly off to infinity clearly visible in the universe without violating in the laws of the energy conservation. The total positive energy of this particle is compensated by its twin particle's lost energy. Thus the black hole is able to radiate particles. The net effect of a particle falling inside the black hole results in its lowering of energy than before. This process progressively results in a black hole less and less energy and finally the black holes disappear out of existence. Thus the reality of something coming out of nothing during the beginning of the universe or something going out of existence from something is real.<br /><br />For every effect there is a cause, but what was there before the first cause? Vedanta philosophy reasoned from this conundrum that the universe and God must be eternal. There is no first cause, in fact causes go backwards and forwards in all directions. There is no beginning and no end. Physics offers a more convincing argument for the concept of God in the idea of multiverse. According to this, our universe is one of the several billions of universes, each with its own set of physical laws and physical reality. The fundamental forces and universal constants are not unique in multiverse physics and anthropic principle is unnecessary. Only the inhabitants of a universe can see and experience their universe, but God as an entity can see and experience all the universes.<br /><br />1.

B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I read the first two books in a matter of two weeks and couldn't wait to start this third and final chapter.  This one was finished in a few days.<br /><br />I was debating on giving it 4 stars but decided upon 5 and this is why.  I enjoyed the first part of the book and the last quarter of the book was fantastic, however the middle kind of dragged for me and I found myself kind of skimming over some parts.  With that being said, don't get me wrong thinking I didn't like this book.  The middle had to be included and I must realize not all parts of a book can hold someone's attention at all times.  The last quarter and the end more than makes up for the slow parts.<br /><br />There were a few other reviewers who didn't like the ending and felt \\"let down\\".  I disagree.  The ending was like it should be.  There was one reviewer who said if you want a happy ending, read Harry Potter.  I chuckled when I read that one but after finishing the book, I understand that response.  It's true, if you want some sappy, happy, everything's fine ending, you'll be disappointed.  The ending is as it should be, an ending.  I walked away from the book satisfied and not wanting for more.  What I liked about the end was the characters were summed up and you kind of knew what happened with them, which was good since I developed a relationship of sorts with them.<br /><br />This is a series about government control and war and neither are fun or pretty topics to discuss.  Bad things happen in both instances.  People are hurt, maimed and yes, sometimes die.  Period the end.<br /><br />The part of the end that I really loved (spoiler, don't read if you haven't read the book) was when Katniss went back to District 12, back to her victor's house and encountered Buttercup.  The cat was looking for Prim, found it's way from District 13 to their house in 12 but couldn't find his human friend.  The experience of grief Katniss finds with Buttercup is quite sweet.  Having had animals help me throughgrief and cuddle with me to comfort me gave me tears.  A very nice addition to a story full of pain and death.<br /><br />All in all, this was a very good book and very good series.  Worth reading!

B005DI65L2|2.0|I was prepared to love this book, however I am having to force myself to keep reading it. The author uses far too many words that I have to stop and look up. I find myself having to read pages over and over - then becoming sleepy and disinterested. Things I was hoping to learn about dog behavior are not present in the book.  Each subject is vague; most of it just mentioned within paragraphs of drivel. Can't recommend this one.
0765348276|3.0|Sadly i could not sympathise whit the novel and gave up after 19 pages, but seeing he won some good award, i maybe give it an other go.<br />a day later i must say the book is getting better fast.
0385535139|4.0|I have often avoided Grisham's work.  I am an attorney in Idaho, and I used to not be able to handle Grisham's mostly cynical view of the legal profession.  As I have gained a little more experience, in life and professionally, I can read this negativity and laugh at myself a little.  Although the practice, mostly, in Idaho, differs greatly than inner city Chicago, or Memphis, TN, there are grains of truth in this book that I really really enjoyed.<br /><br />I thought this book started very well and very interestingly.  A big city, big firm attorney, with five years under his belt, goes down in flames from burnout.  He goes on a bender, and joins a no name firm looking for the big score, while chasing ambulances.  Without an ounce of research, this tiny firm, in search of immense wealth and riches, tries to to take on Big Pharmaceutical.  Big Pharm strikes back with a big firm, big bucks, and a devious plan.<br /><br />In the meantime, the young lawyer finds his stride and helps real people in need, and is successful at it.  He shows how a case should be pursued, and pursues them for the right reasons.<br /><br />The amounts of wealth these big city firms charge, if realistic, is staggering. I liked the depiction of the Federal judge (Seaworth), as I know a few just like that.<br /><br />I also had to laugh at the depiction of the Senator from Idaho.  The irony is that the man was so pro-tort limits and big business, and then his family relied on a lawsuit after his untimely death.  It cut pretty close to home in these parts.<br /><br />This was a great read.  I read it in about 3 days.  I thought it was good fun, with a good mix of action, legal intrigue and courtroom battle.  I would recommend it to all!

B001G8XON0|1.0|I saw as I saw them singing \\"Smells Like Teen Spirit\\" I stopped watching. The most offensive and repugnant scene in cinematic history...must have been Courtney Love's doing. I really can't comprehend the popularity of this movie or Baz Luhrmann (the most superficial and horrid director ever).
B004RJMUJO|3.0|Open fient was bad enough. Now this bentoo or whatever it is. The permissions are jacked. I never play with my Internet on. For ad free paid version, there are too many ads.  Bentoo is an advertising site. If you worry about aggregate data, this app is not for you.

B006P0FD4W|3.0|Out of the 3 Paranormal movies, this was my least favorite. Not to say it wasn't good. The movie dates back to the 80's and follows the childhood of the women from Paranormal 2. They have to use VHS tapes & come up with creative ways to capture video like attaching a camera to a fan that rotates back & forth. The fan actually gave the movie some suspense as it panned slowly back & forth you become anxious waiting to see if there will suddenly be something there that wasn't before.<br /><br />The storyline itself was interesting. But this was much less scary than the previous 2. There is an explanation at the end about how and why everything happened which also leads to an explanation for the 2nd movie. I also noticed many scenes from the trailer were not present in the movie which was a little disappointing. Overall, it was a decent suspense movie but based on the 1st two, and the trailer, I think it could have been better. Anyone that is a fan of the Paranormal movies will find it worth watching.
B005HSL626|3.0|I love this game but unfortunetly. this is the 2nd time I've had to reinstall this game. For some reseaon after playing this game for a long time you are unable to open the game and all your blades and backgrounds you earned are erased. It took me forever to unlock all but 3 blades. I'm now mad upset and depressed.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I had no desire to read this book, but after reading about it everywhere and that they are planning on making a movie about it - I had to know what the big deal was.  I saw someone compare this to Twilight, and I can see why.  This book, I wasn't interested in reading 529 pages of porn, and I was happy to know that it is a man who suffered severely as a child and has very strong feelings of never committing to anyone, never loving someone.  Little does he know that this new woman that he chooses, he cannot escape her, she fights him for answers and for love...and she is winning.  I am proud to admit to people I read this book, there was no way I was going to admit to reading this book - but I did, and I loved it and I downloaded the next 2 books immediately.
0375842209|5.0|I read a lot of books, so it means a lot when I say that this is easily in the top 10 books I ever read.  The Book Thief is one of those rare books that everyone should read.  Those who love books just as much as I do will get special pleasure out of this book, as it follows a girl and her growing love affair with books.

B000N2HBSO|5.0|It took me two years to get through Carwardine's 321 pages on Lincoln and a few ( very busy) weeks to to read Goodwin's 750 pages.  Goodwin has a gift for bringing the characters to life and telling the story in a compelling way.  This book is much about leadership as it is about history. I am recommending it to everyone I know.
B000YXMMAE|5.0|This might sound a little weird, but In Rainbows is my favorite Radiohead album. 2nd is OK Computer, 3rd is Kid A. Generally, it's a calmer album than the rest, and I think, conveys more raw emotion. I nearly cried listening to the ending track 'Videotape' the first time. That's why, after only one listen through on Rdio, I bought the CD. It's a beautiful album, and definitely not one that should be remembered solely for its innovative business model.

0307352145|2.0|Points in the book on introverts are not eye-opening nor interesting; as most information are rather \\"common sense\\" for an introvert. Rather disappointed by the book as the title has such premise that promises great things to unleash the power of introverts.

0061122416|2.0|This is the only Paul Coelho book that I've read, and he seemed to do a good job of making it seem mysterious and parable-ish, which I understand is what Paul Coelho does. However, the entire book went something like this: main character meets someone. That someone tells the main character the story of his life, generally in a paragraph to a few pages. That someone finishes the story of his life with an Important Message for the main character. Main character continues his journey forever changed by that Important Message. Continuing his journey, main character meets someone else. That someone tells the main character the story of his life, generally in a paragraph to a few pages. That someone finishes the story of his life with an Important Message for the main character.... and rinse and repeat, for 150 pages. Furthermore, not a single one of the secondary characters is actually fleshed out; they all function as foils for the main character, and of course, sources of Important Life Lessons.<br /><br />I understand that this is not a novel, and that the secondary characters are there to move along the point of the story, not to, well, be well-developed. However, the moral of the story, was, in the end, very obvious and not at all original. Seize the day, follow your \\"personal legacy,\\" and don't forget to look in your own backyard before voyaging around the world looking for happiness. This message was cloaked in a lot of mysterious-sounding language (terms like \\"personal legacy,\\" for example) and semi-supernatural events, but in the end the book spends 167 pages and a lot of smoke and mirrors basically telling people not to take the easy route through life and to follow their hearts. This could be done in a page or less - which Jose Luis Borges (the man who wrote the 1935 one-page \\"Tale of Two Dreamers\\" on which the Alchemist is based) pretty much did.<br /><br />See for yourself! [...]... (it's in Spanish)<br /><br />BELATED DISCLAIMER: I read this book once before, and thought that perhaps I had read it too quickly and didn't take enough time to reflect on it, because I found it to be... not that great. However, upon rereading (ready to think about it's implications for my own life), I still found it... not that great. I understand that it had a profound effect on some people, and I'm not discounting that. However, it was very clearly not for me.aps I had read it too quickly and didn't take enough time to reflect on it, because I found it to be... not that great.

B004IQ78HA|1.0|With a premise this interesting, how do you go wrong (without giving the project to TimBuuuuuuuur...ton)? Weird in the worst ways, songs written by the deaf & blind in addition to awful voice acting.  The only redeeming quality is the animation which isn't that spectacular in and of itself.

I wish I had read the reviews who wrote about this issue as I probably would not have purchased it. Sure wish I still had the original video tape!
0446547603|4.0|The story is fast paced till the last 90 or so pages then it goes down the hill almost until the end. The question is why all the writers want to fill long-winded pages at the book's end?<br /><br />The plot has one too many happenstances but you'll like the story at the whole and you'll shed some tears at the second and last letter but mind you... read it when you get there.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I wasn't looking for a mind bending literary piece, so my expectations were more like when I'm standing in line at the grocery store and want to thumb through the supermarket tabloids for some fluff....I read the book in several hours while on vacation, and was totally  disgusted, there's no plot, the characters are flat, even at their most erotic best.....it's hard to believe they are going to make a movie out of this garbage, I want my money back..... I  had to give it a star to insert my editorial....Really?<br />Buyer beware, don't waste your money!
B007PTJOV0|5.0|Awesome graphics. Just like Mario only with a cute leprechan. Fairly easy to play. My 5 year old plays and loves it. Works well on kindle fire.

B007PTJOV0|5.0|I saw a bunch of 5 star reviews and I thought, &quot;these must be planted.&quot; But I downloaded the game anyway and it lived up to the hype! It's a Mario style platformer. It's very smooth and amusing to play.
1594200823|4.0|I've been meaning to read \\"Omnivore's Dilemma\\" because I've felt like I should: If you're interested in books about food, this one seems unavoidable. I was hesitant because it's become such a lightning rod that I was concerned it was going to be a highly political jeremiad against modern agriculture, which I actually think is necessary to feed the world. Reading the book, though, it became clear to me that while Pollan certainly has strong opinions of how the world should work, he is not nearly so condemning of alternative views as either his supporters or detractors make him out to be.<br /><br />For this reason, I think it's a good read. Should Michael Pollan be made Secretary of Agriculture, and should this book be required reading in schools? Um, no. Let his supporters make those silly points. He himself is not silly, and I respect that.

1878424114|5.0|This is one of my all time favorite books.  Having purchased the book in the 90's when it first came out, it was the book that initiated my spiritual journey.  The ideas are very clean and concise, prompting the reader to utilize the simple concepts and see/experience the world in a new and profound way. Implementing the 7 steps will change your life.  The book is quite small, and a quick read, but the impact is huge.

B003XF1XOQ|3.0|I'm a grandmother, but I just LOVED the first 'young adult' book, The Hunger Games.  I liked the second book, Catching Fire, a lot.  Mockingjay, however, was just okay.  After reading more than half the book, I just wanted to know how it ended, skipped to the end, and was glad I was finished reading it.
020530902X|5.0|I'm currently reading several books on writing, and this is the best one. It gets straight to the point, and it's written in such a way that anyone can understand. As you read, you can immediately start applying the different elements talked about in the book, making it the most useful guide to have.

B007J4T2G8|2.0|A friend of mine recommended this book.... God knows why.  I could have read the latest story in Playgirl/ Playboy.  Anyhow the author used the phrase, \\"my inner goddess\\" so often I wanted to throw my kindle.  Can you be a little more creative?  How many times do you have to have the character bite her upper lip.... sheesh, maybe she's hungry.  Give her some food.  If you're looking for some cheap thrills read this book but honestly it insulted my intelligence.  And Catherine, why oh why did you recommend this book!
B007PTJOV0|4.0|it reminds me of Mario bros its free and awesome I have nothing bad to say about this game I spend a lot of my time playing this:)
B006PTL1QM|1.0|I have never thought of Kiera Knightly as an especially talented actress, but her overacting in this movie put her even lower in my estimation. Her overacting was definitely one of the contributing factors to ruining the movie for me.  Her bodily contortions and over-the-top facial expressions during the first third of the movie were so ridiculous and distracting that they could have been featured in a Saturday Night Live skit.<br /><br />Beyond that, I can't help but think that the sado-masochism so emphasized in this movie was gratuitous and done to make it more shocking and, thus, appealing to the masses. How many times did we need to see Jung smacking Spielrein's naked buttocks?<br /><br />So, unless you're a masochist like the character Spielrein I wouldn't recommend you watch this movie.

B007BVOF8E|4.0|I'm a little surprised by the amount of criticism for this movie which is coming from 2 directions: 1st, from those who don't enjoy the pace of the realistic spy movie genre, and 2nd, from those comparing it to the original and find it lacking.<br /><br />I have the luxury of having NOT seen the original, as well as enjoying the measured pace and calculated actions of thoughtful spy movies. I also enjoyed the performances from all the actors. It is not an action movie, so accept that before you watch it. But it is very intelligent, extremely well acted, and probably very realistic in its pace.<br /><br />On the other hand, the detractors have some legitimate grievances. Even given the genre and the intentionally measured pace, it could have used some fireworks at key junctures. This would not have insulted the genre nor cheapened it in any way. Even the \\"dramatic\\" scenes seemed to have been intentionally diluted, thereby reducing the dramatic \\"payoff\\" for the viewers. Obviously, this was deliberate in order to conform to the purpose and tone of the movie, but it can be frustrating for viewers.<br /><br />This is not a \\"great\\" movie, but personally I was still satisfied and enjoyed it very much. I enjoy these type movies, e.g. \\"The Good Shepherd\\" (which took 3 viewings to fully understand!). If you enjoy good performances and subtle acting, which this movie has an abundance of, it is worth viewing for this alone.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|After much hype about this book, I knew nothing about it, but it must be a great book getting so much attention, right? First, I DO NOT read romance, but I do indulge in the occasional chick lit that makes me a smile or laugh out loud on occasion.  I was surprised to find not only is this a romance novel, but it goes a few steps beyond.  If you enjoy the romance genre you might like it.  If you like alternative lifestyles/fetishes such as bondage, master/slave, nipple clamps, etc. with your romance you'll love it.  The entire book is very repetitive.  The female never climbs into bed or gets into a car.  The female can only clambor into bed or a car.  Much of the sexual detail was the same thing over and over again (which I will not go into detail in this review).  I think the author either indulges in some BDSM or has done a little research on the subject (having been a hotel manager for many years, I have worked with various alternative lifestyle groups who gave me quite an education).  She/he lacks creativity of the imagination (if this is fiction...but if it based on true life experiences, well, it is just monotonous), as well as vocabulary.  Some paragraphs I found so absurd that I read them to my husband.  We laughed, but not in a good way.  We laughed about the poor structure of sentences, poor usage of adjectives, and so on.  I definitely will not waste money or time reading the author's next two books.  But as I said, if you're into romance novels with nipple clamps...go for it!  Finally, perhaps I hated the book just because I'm me, and I will not be a submissive to any person.  While reading the book, I found myself getting angry with my husband any time he asked me to do something for him because I was angry with the demeaning portrayal of the female character in the book.  At the risk of being repetitive as I have accused the author, this book is just stupid, Stupid, STUPID!
B007PTJOV0|1.0|Ok so I don't have this app yet bus it looks just like the game on a DS Super Mario Brothers. U can just get Super Mario Brothers at Game Stop or something...REALLY!
0062119044|5.0|This novel is infuriating: the characters are completely unlikeable, the subject unrelentingly dark.  I felt myself dreading the next set of horrible revelations as I began each letter.  Which is, I think, what makes the book so brilliant.  I can't remember the last time I've been able to finish a book in which I didn't like the protagonist, or at least some random secondary character.  But the book is so well written and develops so effortlessly that for me it was a very quick read.<br /><br />First, I like the book's format -- a set of letters from Eva, the protagonist, to her estranged husband on the subject of their son Kevin, who developed into a mass murderer.  I can't imagine how the plot would have developed without this particular format (particularly regarding the ending), but it does take some getting used to.<br /><br />Secondly, I think the issues addressed in this novel were handled the way they needed to be: unflinchingly.  This makes for a very dark read, without the benefit of much comic relief.  Child abuse, violence, psychopathy, snobbery  and the notion of evil are all topics of interest, and sometimes the way they are dealt with left me quite disturbed.  So, it's definitely not a beach read -- more of a meditative read.  As a side note, I always read negative product reviews first, and it seems the reason many reviewers don't like the book is that they have found the characters and situations unrealistic.  I believe I have met some Evas (similar in their general attitude toward society) -- not a Kevin, but I think his character is open to interpretation as it is.  As for the situations, is mass murder and its effects on the people involved really so common that there is a norm? I hope not; and I think there is quite a bit of satire in the novel as well.<br /><br />Third, I thought the topic itself was intriguing: part of Eva believes that her son was a \\"bad seed\\" from the start, and the evidence seems to back her up.  Of course, she could be anunreliable narrator and freely admits to being a bad mother, so the subject is really open to interpretation (frustrating, but also fascinating).<br /><br />Fourth, I did like the ending (another weak point for some reviewers).  It was horrifying, but i didn't think it was cheap.  The imagery was chilling, and I thought the build-up was well done. It actually made quite a bit of sense after I scanned the beginning of the novel once I'd finished.<br /><br />So, all in all, if it is possible to hate all the characters and the situations they find themselves in and still love the novel they create, I think this book is book is a wonderful find.

B002M2T1UO|5.0|I bought this series on a whim. A few of my friends recommended it to me since I like other FX shows. I rented Disc 1 through netflix and after two episodes decided to order the Complete series. It was such a great show, had me hooked every episode. The way they shot it is amazing with the handheld/shaky camera feeling helps you become even more riveted with the episodes. They flesh the characters out very well and it makes it near impossible to root against Vic and the boys.<br />I first noticed Walton Goggins on Justified and thought he was amazing as Boyd, so to see him as Shane in the series had me even more excited.<br />Kenny Johnson as LEM was another surprise as I thought he was great on Sons of Anarchy. So I definitively think this is a five star show and collection
B002MQYOFW|5.0|this book is very addictive, also a typical warning against totalitarianism. Very engrossing. I read all three books in a weekend. Most will enjoy.
006197806X|5.0|If you thought Delirium was good, brace yourself and get ready to be blown away by a sequel filled with layer upon layer of romance, action and burning suspense. Fancy yourself a member of Team Alex? Maybe hold off on ordering those 100 t-shirts because you might find yourself reconsidering by the end of this book... Told in alternating chapters of past and present, Oliver will leave you gasping in Pandemonium, desperate to continue the story you're on but dying to get back to where you left off from before. Both stories are equally compelling and will have you hooked until the very end, but then comes the epic cliffhanger that will make you wish 2013 was here already! With gripping characters and an exciting plot, as usual, this must be another 2012 favourite for me!<br /><br />Words can hardly describe how amazing this book was. While the complicated and intense relationship between Alex and Lena dominated the first, Pandemonium is a fast-paced action/adventure that will leave no one complaining of boredom. Immediately we're engaged by Lena's present life as she shows her support at a Deliria Free America rally, having been brainwashed and converted to a Cured. Every little bit of revealed information in the present will have you wondering how it all came to be, but the thrilling story of the past will only dredge up more confusing questions for you to answer. Back in time, Lena's in the Wild and living with a community of Invalids, learning their ways of life and holding onto this tiny thread of connection with Alex, who is presumably dead. Both Lenas are brilliantly strong characters, finding ways to overcome their own unique obstacles and fighting for what they believe in. It was amazing seeing them transform and grow, Oliver doing a superb job by furthering their depth with every chapter.<br /><br />Don't be disappointed at all by the total lack of Alex in this book. I promise you will be so caught up in Lena's journey that you'll hardly even notice! One Julian Fineman does, however, help things along... Straight off the bat it's plain to see that the straight-laced son of the DFA's founder is secretly fascinated by the Wild, in love with the idea of freedom and something more, despite how much he preaches otherwise. Apart from a few forbidden books, this is the only way of life he's ever known...until Lena walks in and flips it upside down with her mere presence. Their chemistry and romance growth is stunning and realistic within the series, Julian changing his opinions about deliria almost painstakingly slowly. While I do still love Alex, Julian's complex character has completely won me over and I'm sure I'm not the only one who feels this way. His personal story is too compelling to resist, especially with his scheduled Cure looming just around the corner...<br /><br />Even though this is a story about love and survival, the author weaves so much mystery into the novel just by telling Lena's story in two parts. Almost each chapter stops at a cliffhanger before the next changes your perception of something that happened before. There are so many shocking twists and hold-your-breath moments that you'll most likely read this in one sitting, because there isn't ever a place where things slow down and you can successfully peel yourself away without feeling as if you're losing a part of yourself! Just about everything in Pandemonium is a slow build up to a revelation, even though something exciting is happening every second page. No doubt, this is the best book of Oliver's I've ever read and I will honestly bow down and kiss the dirt if you can tell me you read this without feeling elated, sad, lusty, anxious and every other emotion at least once while reading this! Requiem will hopefully be just as stunning but after that cliffhanger? It shouldn't be a problem!
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|The beginning of the book is a little slow but you are introduced to great new characters and I believe the time was needed to understand what happens in the end. The book is not nearly as great as the two leading up to and leaves you feeling jilted and wanting more explained.<br />Readers who are hoping they are reading a great love story will be disappointed. However this is also a story of war and how the soldiers of war may be home they will never be the same as they were going in. The book could have been a little longer to explain more of what happens to the characters to give the reader a sense of closure.
B007MNV5WU|4.0|Although everyone has played or owns some Angry Bird game, it never gets old. Yes, the story is the same and you still do the same stuff, but it gets better and better! Gravity, asteroids, and (of course) angle ALL take effect. Great game. Fun for any AB lover!
B007PT3QOQ|1.0|before I could play it- it added 27MB more of whatever. its a little slow moving. I only played about 5mins before I knew I had played this already-Farmville anyone? I don't like time-attention games on my kindle. I don't get on here every hour or can return in 3 hours to check &quot;crops&quot;. uninstalled right away
B0058VW36U|5.0|This is the type of games we all need! Everybody has Angry Birds, so it's nice and refreshing to have a cute game like this. Fun for anyone, regardless of age! Highly recommended and is worth more than the scrap you pay for this game!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|500+ pages of great story.  I don't even consider myself a fan of sci-fi, but I loved this.  Great plot, great characters, intriguing world.  Twists I didn't see coming.  I don't know what else to say about it that hasn't been said already.  I'm just throwing in yet another 5-star review for more confirmation that, yes, this is a great read.  Well worth the ridiculously cheap price.

0374275637|5.0|This book is not only an interesting and entertaining read, but also filled with insights into how the mind works and decisions are made. As a teacher, I was constantly marking pages to go back to and study for use in working with students. I have been recommending it to all my colleagues and am convinced that it will become a \\"buzz-book\\" in the profession and that I will end up in numerous inservice meetings about it.

0307455874|3.0|I just finished reading two very enlightening books.  I am not in the habit of writing book reviews, so I do not intend to do so here.  This will be a very short blog.  What I do want to say is that I just finished reading \\"The Audacity of Hope\\" by Barack Obama.  I immediately picked up \\"No Apology\\" by Mitt Romney.  I highly recommend that every person in the United States do this, even though I know that most do not read and will not.  But this may have been the most revealing study I have ever made.<br /><br /> Two years ago I read \\"Dreams of My Father\\" by Barack Obama.  I found it very foreign.  But it has faded in my memory and I thought I should read something more current and reflective of his campaign for President.  I suppose neither will be remembered as great literature.  But they will reflect the stark differences and futures of these two men and our country.
1250008409|3.0|I'm a Buddhist, though in truth, I can't say I'm the practicing type. Being a full time mom and owning my own business, I find it hard to \\"be in the moment.\\" Mostly, I find myself thinking of the future, anticipating disasters and planning ways to avoid them, looking at the past and trying to learn lessons from it. I am far from living in the moment. So I wanted to sit back, re-evaluate things and maybe find practical advise on taking bits of solitude in my daily life.<br /><br />This book did not help in that regard.<br /><br />It was frustrating because it takes him a long time to get to the point. I know, I know, what happened to patience, right? Regardless, I did not like slogging through so many anecdotes to finally get to the good bits, and yes there ARE good bits. I found myself underlining a few words of wisdom but it just takes so long to get there.<br /><br />There were several things that struck me as odd. The beginning of the book almost feels like you're talking to a salesman. He's trying to sell you on the benefits of meditation and how it can improve your life. But if you're holding the book in your hands, chances are you've already heard about the benefits and are interested in more. You don't need someone to go on for pages and pages about how wonderful it is. Secondly, the entire book was so focused on the author himself. So much personal story and so much \\"I.\\" Usually, monks are not so self focused.<br /><br />One of the good things about this book is it does not speak about religion at all. He firmly has separated meditation from Buddhism, which is fine because it really is a religion-free practice. So those of you worried you'll be indoctrinated with Buddhist theory, have no fear. But otherwise, I think there are much better books out there for those curious about meditation. Try [[ASIN:0807012394 The Miracle of Mindfulness: An Introduction to the Practice of Meditation]] or [[ASIN:188837540X Being Peace]].
B0054JZC6E|5.0|very fun.  one of the great things is that your getting tons of apps in one, and its free.<br />the games aren't cheap-o like some other watever-in-one apps. very fun game.
B003VR5PPY|5.0|This was over-all the best game I have ever played. The story plot was ingenious! Each character had their own creative past and personality, that fit together perfectly with the story. You needed the personal knowledge of each characters past and present to understand. It was like a puzzle, the best most thought-out, amazing puzzle in the world. I didn't mind the reading, and i liked that there was no real pressure to complete tasks fast (it would be ironic if you were only given 9 hours to play :P). I enjoyed the multiple ending because it gave you new born information towards the true ending, and, like life, there are many possible ways it could end up. For those people who have \\"played it\\" and said it was \\"okay\\", i believe you didn't understand the concept! Either that or you didn't reach the true ending! I am waiting for Zeros Escape: Zeros Last Virtue to come out. Cant wait! i hope its as good as the first!<br /><br />PS: I understood everything, it wasn't confusing at all, and I'm a 12 year old girl :P I didn't mind the gore either.

B005DF2QMC|3.0|I enjoy having this product, but it was made a bit lightly constructed. I was hoping to receive an adapter with this product because the DC3V adapter is hard to find to fit this product. Perhaps the supplier such ave included it (or made it known that they had one available for an additional charge because recording with batteries done work as well as with an electronic aid). Other product advertisers had everything included for a larger amount of money (perhaps this might be a solution to this suppliers future). I would like to purchase an adatper from this supplier (from this item) if they have one.

The lives of Harry Clifton and the Barringtons is all absorbing and keeps you wanting to read on and on. I also didn't want the book to end as now I have to wait for Clifton Chronicles 3 of which there had better be one. Jeffrey Archer has such a wonderful way with words and I can only recommend this book 100%.

141690977X|5.0|Okay as a male in his early twenties, just getting into the dating scene, I will have to agree with the authors who are trying to say \\"Some guys just are not that interested in you!\\"<br /><br />I also have to agree with the comment about how shy guys have a hard time saying even a hello to a girl that he likes (I WAS ONE).  But below I am mainly focus on normal guys who are not very shy or very outgoing.<br /><br />But anyways, the reason why I am writing this review even though I have not read the book is that I feel like girls just do not get you don't like them, no matter how much you ignore them. Yeah, I might have smiled and said hi to have a conversation with you, but that does not mean I really like you.  It just means I am trying to see if I like you or not.  Some girls take this too seriously and think the guy likes them when only he was trying to be nice with a friendly chit chat.<br /><br />My main message and advice for the ladies:<br /><br />IF YOU GIVE A GUY AN OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK WITH YOU, WHETHER IT IS SITING NEAR HIM ALONE, OR MAKING EYE CONTACT TO LET HIM KNOW THAT YOU ARE OPEN TO TALK, AND HE STILL DOES NOT INITIATE A CONVERSATION THEN THIS MEANS HE IS REALLY NOT INTERESTED.  SO IF IT IS VERY VERY VERY EASY FOR HIM TO SPEAK WITH YOU BUT HE STILL DOES NOT INITIATE A CONVERSATION THAT MEANS HE IS REALLY NOT INTERESTED.<br /><br />IN CONTRAST:  I HAVE CHASED GIRLS WHO WERE JOGGING JUST TO SAY HI BECAUSE I WAS HIGHLY INTERESTED. IT WAS NOT VERY EASY FOR ME TO SPEAK WITH HER BUT I STILL INITIATED THE CONVERSATION.  THIS SITUATION SHOWS WHAT AN INTERESTED GUY LOOKS LIKE: SOMEONE WHO IS WILLING TO SPEAK WITH YOU EVEN IF THERE IS A LOT OF RISK AND WORK INVOLVED.<br /><br />IN CONCLUSION:  REALLY, IF A GUY IS NOT VERY ATTENTIVE TO YOU, JUST MOVE ON.  THERE WILL ALWAYS BE OTHER MEN WHO THINKS YOU ARE THE MOST BEAUTIFUL GIRL IN THEIR REALITY.  PLUS, YOUR SELF-WORTH SHOULD NOT BE DEPENDENT ON PEOPLE'S APPROVAL.
B000H30B2C|3.0|I am usually opposed to making remakes of major classics that are beloved by huge numbers of people. King Kong is really no exception. It might seem like a prime candidate for an update, as you sometimes have to smile at some of their primitive 1933 special effects. But you have to remember that we could never do what we do today if it weren't for their pioneering efforts, and the step-by-step improvements of everyone else along the way. The biggest problem, of course, is that many movie-makers today - those who did this version of King Kong included - overdo it. Back then, you had to be creative to get something you wanted on the screen. Today, all you have to do is type a couple buttons on a computer.<br /><br />One thing that was definitely more REALISTIC in the original King Kong was the WALL. That was definitely BUILT, and by HUMANS! That huge stone wall in the new version... wow. That looked so fake, especially when the camera pulled back and you could see it from way up in the air, lit on fire.<br /><br />I did enjoy this version of King Kong. It kept my attention for the most part, but there were too many times I was just thinking, \\"Oh, come on already!\\" Kong fights three t-rexes to save the girl. Fine. But after he tosses them over the cliff, did he and the girl really need to fall over the cliff after them??? And then the girl bounces back and forth from t-rex tooth to t-rex tooth until Kong rescues her again. Sigh. The other dinosaur chase that ended with them falling in a pile was so drawn out! (Almost funny, really.) The sea-monsters seemed unnecessary. And the bugs and wormy things! So gross! How did ANY of them get out of that alive? I guess because they kind of just disappeared. And what was up with the car chase at the end???<br /><br />I saw in the special features that even the water they rowed the boat in was CGI. For goodness sake. You will not convince me that rigging up a rocking boat, hanging a green screen, splashing water at the actors, having them put fake pressure on the oars, and animating in water is simpler than putting a boat in water and filming it. After all, they did it 80 years ago. (\\"But the weather might not be right!!!\\") I think it's just an excuse to show off what they can do. This whole movie was an excuse to show off what they could do. Some of it they did well. Most of it looked fine. It was just way too much.<br /><br />Overall, not a bad movie, but not destined to become a classic. In the meantime, if you want to see the original doll used as one of the models for King Kong in the original 1933 movie, check out [[ASIN:B0002XMJ1I Lucy Mania: The Lucy-Desi Westinghouse Special]].

B005K0HDGE|5.0|I LOVED this book from the first page!  I was so happy it was a big, long book because I wanted to keep reading it for a long time!  I really can't remember the last time I felt this way about a book.<br /><br />The premise is captivating...could the world be a different and better place if JFK had not been assasinated? Having the 2012 character go back in time and describe how he views life in the 50's and 60's made such a great read.  Stephen King did an amazing job with characters, plot, and description of a simpler time.<br /><br />I wish I could go back in time and read this book again for the first time!
B000E1MXSW|4.0|The Catholic Church seems controversial today (without even getting into how they've been intertwined with politics lately), but a lot has changed in the last century. I bought this movie because I am an Audrey Hepburn fan and read the book after seeing the movie. I didn't really care for the book. It was really hard to read, I think because of the lack of dialogue. Almost the entire thing was narrative and the nun spent pretty much the entire book thinking about how bad she was (which the Catholic Church put into her head), and how she just couldn't obey, which was depressing. The movie was pretty similar, but I enjoyed it.<br /><br />I quit being Catholic ages ago, for many reasons that do not belong in an Amazon review. But one was the guilt trips that the Church shoves down your throat. But boy, was it worse back then, and especially for nuns. They couldn't so much as take a drink of water between meals without permission! (I wondered what gave some of them the power to give that permission, but they never addressed that.) They couldn't talk after hours. They weren't allowed to keep photos of their family. They weren't allowed to make friends with their fellow nuns. They weren't allowed to be proud of anything they had accomplished. They had to get all their hair chopped off (I think they weren't allowed to be attractive). They weren't allowed to look in mirrors. They weren't even allowed to mourn when a fellow nun died! Worse, when they commit these horrible sins, they have to lie on their stomachs and announce how fallible they are in front of their fellow nuns. The rest of the world is off lying and stealing and eating cake and they have to feel incredibly guilty for drinking water! I know nuns don't have any such requirements these days, but the Catholic Church hasn't much escaped from the fear factor and guilt thing. A little progress, maybe.<br /><br />As a movie, and a piece of entertainment, I really liked The Nun's Story. Bad, chopped off hair could not hide Audrey Hepburn's beauty (not that you can tell nuns have hair). This was an excellent acting role for her, much different from all the other movies of hers I have collected so far. Everything else I have is much lighter. I was not familiar with most of the cast, but on a whole the movie was well-done. I enjoyed the scenes in the Congo and could understand why Audrey's character was so unhappy with having to leave there.hide Audrey Hepburn's beauty (not that you can tell nuns have hair).

B007IQX1G4|3.0|[Spoiler alert] This was a tough watch. I expected anti-hero dark comedy, but it's far more dark than comedy. Sure, we're given plenty of the 'oblivious beauty queen in state of painfully arrested development.' It was fun watching her attempts to skew reality in the way that best suited her needs; that's the defining trait of the Mean Girls, after all. Then the pity happens. We see that she's seriously broken under there, and we're expected to feel bad for her. Poor, sad drunk pretty girl. And just when she seems to be at the brink of a genuine breakthrough, she hops back into her broken life and drives away.<br /><br />While I admit that a magical Romey & Michelle redemption for Mavis would have infuriated me, it would've been nice to see that she learned even the slightest bit from her escapade. But the fact is, some people simply don't learn. They peak at 17, then face 60 long years of mediocrity. That's an ugly truth. Some people have their lives utterly ruined at 17 and never quite get over it, and that is also true. So don't expect a quippy, quirky, long overdue hair-pulling for the mean girl 'cause this ain't it.  DO, however, look for brilliant and nuanced performances from both Theron and Oswalt.  They both dig right to the center of these characters and own every bit of their frailty and ugliness and complexity.

0609610570|3.0|For the Christmas Holidays, as we were packing the ski stuff from the basement before we left to VT, I chanced upon some books lying there, and noticed the one titled 'Execution,' by Larry Bossidy and Ram Charan which I had bought almost 8 years ago but never got around to reading it.  On a whim, I decided to take it with me and ended up reading it through these holidays.<br /><br />A quick caveat to put aside.  I do wish folks would not use company names as examples in books.  The original one of these, \\"In Search of Excellence\\" by Tom Peters did that.  So did Jim Collins in \\"Good to Great\\".  And this book does it too.  What happens is that the authors use some company as an example to cite either a good or a bad practice.  And a decade has passed and things have changed (perhaps 180 degrees).  And that induces a chuckle in addition to both dating the book and casting doubt on the claim.<br /><br />However, at least for this book, 'Execution', the above is only a caveat, since I found the book quite meaningful.  The reason I perhaps did not read it when I first bought it many years ago is that it felt genuinely elementary.  I was at the peak of my strategy work and when you are working on projects that are either reshaping a company or positioning oneself in new markets, the discipline of execution seems not only boring, but downright waste of time (not the importance of it mind you, but rather spending time thinking or reading about it).<br /><br />However, now that I have moved on from the strategy function myself and am in a line management role with accountability for business results and accountability for a team and partner-relationships to deliver those results, I view this book in an entirely new light!<br /><br />To share a personal reaction as I read this book ( a feeling I have not had since when I sat for my twelfth grade board examination!) - when I thought about implementing the ideas that Larry and Ram were talking about in their book on Tuesday morning Jan 2nd when I return to work, my stomach tightens into a knot!  The level of sustained focus, discipline, follow through, attention to detail they expect in execution is non-trivial to say the least.  Again, conceptually easy to grasp; but quite daunting if one thinks about putting them into real practice on a sustained basis throughout an organization!<br /><br />Very briefly, they touch upon the strategic, people and operational processes as three core processes that are building blocks for execution and show how the three are related to each other.  And through their experience and examples demonstrate how to implement each of these effectively.  One particular insight that I liked that Larry made in particular was, 'just because an executive is good in her current job, does not mean she is ready or capable for the next'.  Which is similar to what our Chairman says, \\"do the job you have been assigned, not your previous one.\\"<br /><br />Of course with a background in engineering (and manufacturing to boot), this whole notion of execution and organizing to execute is not alien to me at all.  And in reality, my immersion for a long time in strategic work was what I needed to be more lithe in my thinking.  However executing by one self or with a small team in a localized way on a specific deterministic engineering problem is one challenge.  But to do the same with large revenues and large teams at stake and working through your teams through other teams with high week-to-week dependence on market conditions is another challenge.<br /><br />This timely book was very worthwhile spending time with.  Dated examples notwithstanding, one of the more immediately useful and relevant books in the business genre that I have read in a long time.ing Jan 2nd when I return to work, my stomach tightens into a knot!

B003G4W49C|5.0|The best thing about Ender's Game is that it can be read on a multitude of levels. It's good if the reader sees only the superficial plot, even the superficial subtext. But, if one delves deeper and begins to see the rich subtext that is the deep undercurrent of the story, then one now gets an awesomely complex read. Great either way. My new favorite book

B006ZCWU5K|5.0|In his starkest album since Nebraska and the Gost of Tom Joad, Bruce Springsteen channels his anger at the destruction of the American Dream by the forces of greed on Wall Street into a masterpiece. \\"My Hometown\\" his early vision has given way to the wrecking ball of \\"Death to My Hometown.\\"<br /><br />The songs have a Celtic flavor. \\"Shackled and Drawn\\" would sound good given the Dropkick Murphy's treatment. There are also songs of raw melancholy like \\"Jack of All Trades\\", where \\"the banker man grows fatter, and the working man grows thin.\\" Bruce's Jack concludes the song with, \\"If I had me a gun I'd find the bastards and shoot `em on sight...\\"<br /><br />The last song on the album, reminds me of both Faulkner's \\"As I lay Dying\\" and James Joyce's \\"The Dead.\\" In the song, the dead of America speak to the living relating both their struggles in America, how and when they died and their message of hope (almost a sequel to the song \\"The Rising\\"):<br /><br />\\"Our souls and spirits rise<br />To carry the fire and light the spark<br />To fight shoulder to shoulder and heart to heart...\\"<br /><br />Bringing one last bit of hope to the Land of Hopes and Dreams...

B007J4T2G8|2.0|I can't believe I paid ten bucks for this book. It was recommended to me by a BSDM older male practitioner, and then I read about it's success in the NYT, so I thought I would give it try. Ana is such a juvenile character, Gray is so two dimensional, I found I could not care about them at all. How anyone could make it through the trilogy is beyond me. I know I'm not wasting any more money on it. Kudos to the author for coming up with a winning formula, but the sex didn't do anything for me, either the vanilla or the BSDM. Not representative of the lifestyle, as far as I can tell.

B006OFN0SE|3.0|I am sure that when J. Edgard Hoover started the federal bureau of investigations that he had the noblest of intent, however as we now know he is better remember for his deceit, corruption and questionable behavior than anything else. Producer-director Clint Eastwood wants to change that image somewhat in his new film by apologizing at best and excusing at worst the behavior of Hoover. When in truth, a powerful dramatic film exposing his faults by showing his noble ambitions to start with could be an interesting film and easily should have been when this talent pool came together on this particular film. Alas, if I only had a dime for every great missed opportunity I've spotted 1in cinema.<br /><br />As it stands the movie J.EDGAR still unfolds well enough on the screen, the performances are great, Leonard Di Caprio does well in the title  role despite the script lacking depth or warmth for his character. Armie Hammer under plays the role of Clyde Tolson as to never steal the spotlight. Judi Dench is masterful as always as Edgar's mother, dominating Leo in every scene as to allow us to fully feel the role she must have played in Hoover's real life. The period production details are flawles, this is always one of my favorite things in the movies, I love the feel of going back in time, much more than the feeling of purely fantastic worlds such as Narnia or middle Earth.<br /><br />All this this under Eastwood's direction keeps the movie watchable, and even at has moments of greatness, but other things seem to constantly distract the viewer. The make-up effects, which I believe were Oscar nominated, serve as the largest of these nuisances simply because of the movies misguided structure which has the elderly Hoover telling his story to a writer, so we see a lot of Leo in unconvincing old man getup. If you see the film, notice that he resembles a cross between Jack Nicholson and Truman Capote, or at least Toby Jones playing Truman Capote. This serves as a constant distraction, but Hammer's make-up is far worst.  We also get a lot of cliche dialogue, especially in Di Caprio's voice overs, at one point he informs us that those who forget the past, well, at least he let's us fill in the blank. This script by the way is from the Oscar winning writer of [[ASIN:B001QUF3SW Milk]], he just seems to have gotten lazy here. The lighting is very somber and doesn't help to make the characters any more likable when our tolerance for these people are generally wanting.<br /><br />The way the movie handles Hoover's personal life, i.e the relationship with Clyde Tolson, is handle with kid cloves. As is the awkward, but sensible way Eastwood deals with the allegations of J. Edgar's cross dressing, the scene is played out in sort of a touching way. Still, the most interesting parts of Hoover's life seems to be barely touched upon or skipped over all together, this may be partially explained by a late scene in the film when Clyde Tolson tongue lashes Edgar for telling \\"exaggerations and blatant lies\\" in his autobiography, which the movie had already dramatized as if fact. Then the film ends abruptly, pretty much the same way the whole movie had played out, matter-of-factly and unconvincing.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|This app is almost the same as Mario!! Love it.  I love the style and the graphics. cool cool cool!
B0062NAX1U|2.0|While never having seen this or the other movies from this director, I had a good idea of what to expect: a heavy-handed wall-to-wall sermon regarding the movie's theme, which in this case was about being a good father.<br /><br />For the first 45 minutes, I was pleasantly surprised; while faith was brought up, it was kept somewhat low-key.  There were also some genuinely funny moments, mostly between the lead cop and his partner.<br /><br />But then tragedy struck, and I was proven right; after that, it seemed like every other scene discussed God or faith or the Bible, and it was very blunt about delivering its message, which I rarely like in a movie, regardless of its genre.  It also included a scene about accepting Jesus Christ as your personal Savior.<br /><br />I agree with the film's message; fathers need to step up and fulfill their responsibilities, I just believe that there are other ways besides the Bible and faith to guide you.  It almost seems like this film is saying it's the only and/or best way to do it.  So what about fathers from other faiths?  Or atheist fathers?  Does that mean they are incapable of being good fathers?  I disagree.<br /><br />It seems to me organized religion and its followers are always difficult topics to bring up in a film; either the followers are portrayed as close-minded fundamentalist zealots or just one step away from sainthood.  There is only movie I can immediately think of that does not fall into one of those categories, and that is [[ASIN:B000XA1GH8 Saint Ralph]], although I am sure there are others.
B007IUBU86|3.0|You really need to take this album for what it is, and be in the mood to listen to it.  The mix on this album is improved from the EP, although the bumble bee widdly widdly guitar solos still grate on me when they appear.  It's hard to explain, I know he's a great guitar player but something with his playing just doesn't click with me.  There are some good riffs throughout though.<br /><br />Some of it is in the ridiculous zone:<br />-Psychosane<br />-Down To The Floor (although improved from the EP)<br />-Freight Train (At least it wasn't a Nitro cover!)<br /><br />but there were some great songs here too:<br />-Come Undone (great Duran Duran cover!)<br />-Undaunted<br />-All on the Line<br /><br />It should not be compared to Dream Theater or Symphony X, because that's not what this album is at all.  Yes, it's all a bit WWE-ish (Disturbed?), but I have to say that I had a lot of fun listening through Omerta, even laughing out loud a couple of times 'ARE YOU MOTHER F...ERS FEELING MEEEEE'. I'm not sure if that was the reaction they were going for, but oh well, I was having fun!<br /><br />I don't think it will be in my regular rotation, but it was an excellent fit while driving through LA traffic. 3 1/2 stars.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|There has been so much hype about the Fifty Shades Trilogy that I finally decided to try it out myself. I really didn't care for the price but I understand the reasons why!<br /><br />Now this story borders on the BDSM which makes people gasp but overall I found the Ana and Christian's story to be very enlightening.  Typically when we meet someone so messed up mentally we stay away and ward others that it isn't worth the time or effort to build a relationship. Ana thought differently and as the story continues in three parts I congratulate her on her willingness to fight for the man she loves.<br /><br />The conversations between Ana and Christian were funny and sad during their many email exchanges.<br /><br />Christian's was so afraid of anyone getting close to him that he became an ultimate control freak. The best part is that he knew something was wrong with him and sought out counseling.<br /><br />On the flip side of the story I felt Ana was too young to be in a relationship that serious but thing again if she were order and had more experience she would have never worked on a relationship with Mr. Grey.<br /><br />I liked that this series is making people think and have discussion regardless if they liked it or not. All books should be written well enough to make you want to engage in dialogue with others giving your opinion.

1451673442|5.0|This last book by Rhonda Byrnes is sort of a nice follow up guide to The Secret. I am not sure of the magic to reach your goals but definetly her books are inspiring and provide you direction and purpose to help you attain your goals in addition to making you aware that being a better person always help to reach your goals. I think these books are really a blessing!
B007PTJOV0|5.0|I just found Lep's World late last night and am enjoying it very much. Brings back fun memories of the old gen games.<br />I'm playing on a Kindle Fire and it plays beautifully.<br />I would like an option to change the controls, as my hands are small so sometimes it looks like I'm trying to run in circles. Thanks NER Brothers for an awesome FREE game!
B004ZNB12O|4.0|As most of the readers must know, Pink Floyd often has had albums that had continuity between song selections as part of the overall theme of the music in total. While each song selection has merit, one often finds that they are cut-off from the entirety of the theme of the music. In this, I can only say that unless you are particularly fond of one selection of song or selection of their music, the only real way to encompass and realize Pink Floyd in total is to buy the entire album(s). So very often their music transition into another song and this is one reason why. For older albums, this is not so much an issue, but I'd say perhaps from Meddle forward, one should consider the entire album to encompass the experience of their music in whole, rather than pieces that are cut short.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|this game is really really fun and its very addicting more that the classic Mario fun fun fun fun fun fun
B004IWF64Q|4.0|I actually liked this movie almost more than the first one. It could have been a bit better and I did not care for how John Smith's character turned out, however I thought John Rolfe was a very good character. He actually seemed human; he had a few awkward moments and he really seemed to care about Pocahontas. He was a nice change from the \\"superhero\\" prince type character. This movie is a good watch for a lazy evening or to keep the kids entertained.
B002L3RVCY|4.0|I'm 34 years old and, like many, grew up loving Star Wars but hating that it was diminished into a stream of toys and nothing more.  This producing a seemingly endless conveyor belt of revenue into the Skywalker Ranch. However, I still keep a fond and reasonable (I do not attend conventions) affection for Star Wars.<br /><br />With that short-lived slam out of the way, I'm happy to recommend Star Wars: The Clone Wars-the Complete Season One.  I bought it for my 4 year old son who recently discovered Star Wars and all the toys ($$$).  We enjoy watching the shows together and I love the added story lines to the new (disappointing) prequal trilogy.  Specifically, the story lines that add to what we all already know about Yoda, General Grevious, and the clones are great fun to watch. The animation is top notch and only improves the experience.  I look forward to purchasing all the seasons that have been released. Additionally, the quality of the packaging that this season comes in is great and is worth keeping on a shelf and not in a box in the basement.<br /><br />*I look forward to maintaining my futile hope that Lucas' vision will be added to and new and improved movies may someday see the light of day. Remember, I did say that it was a futile hope ;)

096798467X|5.0|I used this book as reference material. I own mobile wood fired pizza trucks and trailers. We build and use refractory brick ovens. Kiko's book has helped us tremendously. I do have a working knowledge of decorative and structural concrete. We started out years ago making earth ovens. Kiko's books have a wealth of knowledge. If you have any DIY capability this book will instruct and entertain you. Like anything worthwhile it does require some work and effort on your part. I have had people at my pizza truck who know Kiko and say he is a great person to know and very knowledgable. I recommend this book all the time at my pizza truck. People ask me all the time to build them ovens and after I tell them the price for a refractory brick oven ( plus I just do not have to build the whole thing for them) I recommend the book. I need to have these books in stock at my truck. By the way because of this book two more of my brothers in Utah are making their living with wood fired pizza ovens. Thank you Kiko!

B0052VUNHC|2.0|The beginning held some promise but half way to the book the characters feelings turn into a possesivness and jealousy to such an extent that it is not romantic anymore but really disturbing and dysfunctional.<br />The angst and drama are also completely and utterly over the top and the plot goes around and around in circles. ENDLESSLY.<br /><br />Is this supposed to be a YA book? Beacuse I think there's too much violence, drinking, and sex for it to be one while in the other hand the plot, dialogues and sex scenes are too \\"mild\\" and juvenile to consider this book an adult romance novel...<br /><br />Anyway, I really do not understand how so many readers can find such a creepy and codependent relationship with a violent guy romantic. I like tough/bad alpha male characters but Travis is not that at all, he really is dysfunctional and annoying, turning from bursts of anger to whining like a toddler on and on... the whole plot also feeds on the idea of the mean guy (=every girl is a whore, not good enough to have sex with him in his own bed) who turns into the most devoted and romantic lover when he finds The One... disgusting. This message should stop being passed on to the next generations, lots of girls end up in abusing relationships with abusing bastards just waiting for the tale to come true, the day when he will change for her.<br /><br />So the only reason I'm not giving this book one star is because I finished it; the writing wasn't all that bad despite of all the grammatical errors/typos and the story and characters had some potential at least at the very beggining.<br /><br />- AND JUST BECAUSE -<br /><br />Everytime I buy (and read) a book based on the outstanding amount of 5 and 4 stars reviews and then leave my own saying that I didn't like it, my review gets labelled as Not Useful. Seriously??<br /><br />I read at least 4 books a week and in the last months most of them have been pretty bad or even plainly terrible due to the loads of misleading reviews people is giving \\"freely\\"<br /><br />English is not my mother tongue so leaving a review takes some effort and quite a bit of time for me and I'm getting sick of wasting my time not only reading those crappy books but also writting later my honest and hopefully always respectful opinion so other readers can make their own minds just to have a bunch of \\"vigilantes\\" discrediting my opinion. Maybe that's the goal, guys? That nobody leave reviews that are not good?<br /><br />I truly understand if my reviewes don't provide the info some people would like to read about, it happens to me also with some of the reviews I read but I don't label them as \\"Not Useful\\" just because they didn't give me the info I wanted, BUT MOST IMPORTANTLY I don't check the reviews of books I've liked in the past just to check for the low rating reviewers and \\"avenge\\" the author.<br />Not even do I go back to those blatantly misleading reviews which convinced me to buy the books I've disliked and label them as Not Useful, so: Who are you people? Maybe the ones that leave all those great reviews that only say things in the line of: \\"OMG!! Best read ever. Totally recommended!! You have to read this!!!!\\"? Just guessing...ther tongue so leaving a review takes some effort and quite a bit of time for me and I'm getting sick of wasting my time not only reading those crappy books but also writting later my honest and hopefully always respectful opinion so other readers can make their own minds just to have a bunch of \\"vigilantes\\" discrediting my opinion.

B005NPLXJ4|4.0|I am a die hard Metallica fan and I must say this album is good! Many fans are unable to think outside the box, and feel metal is metal and there should be no variation. Being an artist does not mean you must conform to playing one way or performing in one way. Music is an art. There are no rules, it is an expression. Keep that thought in mind, and give Lulu a try!

B001RCD2DW|5.0|Without repeating everything that has been said about these headphones, I will add that it is recommended to use these in a very quiet place. The open design lets every sound in the room in. Also, the Fiio E9 headphone amplifier does a good job with these headphones. I leave the amp volume on between 2/3 and 3/4 and adjust the volume on the computer. Burn-in time can be confirmed too, they didn't sound good at all for the first week or so.<br /><br />Update: after 7 months of use....there is a clear plastic tab on either side with a slot down the center, this plastic piece has snapped completely in half on the right side and the left side is about 80% cracked across. there are multiple cracks that all start on the outside edge of this piece on both sides. anyone else have this issue?

B000OYC7A8|5.0|This concert is absolutely incredible and loaded with spectacular bonus features. David's \\"On An Island\\" material and all the \\"Pink Floyd\\" tunes are AMAZING! Every song is incredible. My favorites are not only The Dark Side Of The Moon tunes, but \\"Coming Back To Life\\" and \\"Echoes\\" were my favorite. I actually do think the DVD version of Pulse is better when it comes to the Pink Floyd stuff, but \\"Echoes\\" sounds amazing live and so do the other Floyd tunes on this DVD. Even better than the studio recordings. David's guitar work is killer and the concert gets better and better. The special guest appearances were a great selection from David Crosby, Graham Nash, to Robert Wyatt (but didn't care for David Bowie).I didn't care much for Bowie covering Roger Waters's verse in Comfortably Numb. Never was a big David Bowie fan. I liked the camera shots of David's fingers moving across the fret board and just all the camera shots in general. Even the quality of the picture and sound on this DVD is more than great, it felt like I was watching this on blu-ray. For anyone who is a Pink Floyd and/or David Gilmour fan, definitely buy this DVD. You will not be disappointed. It will rock your world.

B002MQYOFW|5.0|The first page in this book, I didn't even think about putting this book down. It was that good! When I saw the movie ALL of my  friends agreed the book was better than the movie. But they're both on my favories list!:)
B00005T7I1|5.0|I don't know what it is I like about this movie, but I remember as a kid how terrified by the villains I was. Now that I'm older I see who, they're hideous characters that stand out from the rest of us by their physical deformities. Their actions make them monsters, and true to form they look like monsters. And then there's Dick Tracy in his iconic yellow getup spouting things like \\"the bad men are scaring me.....take them away.\\" He's the last line of defense against these crooks, and you GET that throughout the movie.<br /><br />And the adult themes are aplenty, so I am glad that this movie was made for the baby boomers who grew up with the comic and not for a new generation that likes to humanize the villain. And holy crap, Madonna is in this picture and there isn't a single cover song or cameo-esque feel....well done. She had the femme fatale role down perfectly.<br /><br />This is the widescreen DVD format.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|it is good though I think the energy recharge time should be shorter. make original version for kindle fire cheaper please.
B003YCIE68|5.0|What can I say, I love watching this movie. The wonder as each room of the elves workshop is revealed, the joy the elves demonstrate openly as they craft toys and the perfect Santa. There are no snarky moments, no wisecracking of mockery of the story, everyone takes their role seriously and that's what makes this work. You even have my favorite actor, Dudley Moore, playing a straightforward and honestly kind character so perfectly you forget you're looking at the comedic genius behind Arthur and Wholly Moses. He gets top billing but never steals the limelight from anyone in any scene. He plays it straight and subdued, and now I realize why I never made the connection when I was a kid that this guy was Arthur...they're two distinct facets of the same man.<br /><br />This disc is the widescreen version and I loved seeing things I hadn't in my VHS copies. This is a dazzling film which I hope someday will be released on BluRay, but we'll see.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|this game is a lot of fun. theres many levels and its like Mario brothers. its worth downloading for sure.
1451673442|5.0|I love this book.  I practiced \\"The Secret\\" and \\"The Power\\" but I think \\"The Magic\\" is my favorite.  I really like the 28 day program.

HD doesn't matter on the KF since it has very high resolution (1200X800) on only a 7&quot; screen. Is just a waste of money with little or NO difference.

B003QO8TDC|5.0|UPC 097361224145 Flashdance Special Collector's Edition (DVD + soundtrack CD)<br /><br />I picked up my DVD locally in the bargain bin (new condition).  It is a different version of the Special Collectors Edition because it also has printed \\"Includes an exclusive 6-track music CD\\".  Other than this, it looks exactly like the front DVD cover.  While it only has 6 tracks instead of the 10 on the soundtrack cd, I feel the major songs from the movie are here.  The tracks are in this order:<br /><br />1)  Flashdance - What A Feeling<br />2)  Manhunt<br />3)  He's A Dream<br />4)  Lady, Lady, Lady<br />5)  Romeo<br />6)  Maniac<br /><br />It would have been nice to add the other 4 tracks, but I still think it was a good deal.<br /><br />Just letting you know there is another version and maybe you'll be lucky enough to find it.<br /><br />I really enjoyed seeing the movie again, and the bonus soundtrack was icing on the cake.
B004MC8CA2|4.0|Doesn't recognize other versions I have downloaded, but otherwise it has great features as long as you have wifi access.
B007MS5B6Q|5.0|I am not sure how this series can attract any criticism for season two.The show was fantastic in every way. The comments about too much talking and not enough action must have been made by unfeeling zombies! The show exuded tension for every second it was on the air. The action scenes were not every second, but the dialogue and scenes built up to it. It was a season of consolidation, where the characters tried to find a way of leading a normal life in an abnormal situation. Another great thing about Walking Dead is the fact that no character seems to be safe and you never know  who will kick the bucket next! The show was the best thing on TV at the time it was aired and I for one cannot wait for season three.
B002WSR8A8|5.0|Got the import Music on Vinyl pressing, which i'm very pleased with. Although a bit pricey, it's a fabulous reissue, and it includes two bonus tracks at the end of each side of the record. The first is called \\"Out in the Cold\\", and is actually really quite good. The other is a live version of \\"Smokewater Jack\\",which doesn't really improve much on the studio version. Either way, every song here is pretty much a winner, particularly the first three which are now considered legendary. High quality pressing, no unwanted surface noise or any of that. If you're willing to pay the steep price, I'd totally recommend this.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|I started the game yesterday and haven't been able to quit playing! If you like farming games, hunting games, and some decision making this is a game you should play. Bonus: they alert you when crops are done so you don't let them wither.
B000VDDWDS|5.0|Why this film did not win the Academy Award for best sound editing is beyond me.  The initial release of Master and Commander on Standard DVDs contained DTS Audio which is relatively rare for most non Blu Ray DVDs and the production on the Standard DVD version was really quite good.  The Blu Ray version simply raises the bar and does it outstandingly.  I never like to summarize story lines as some do.  I am only really interested in the quality of the disc.  A viewer can determine for themselves the quality of the plot and acting.  The video transfer on Blu Ray is quite excellent with deep rich colors and great details in the dark and shadowy areas.  No complaints here at all.  There are plenty of extras but, for me , the most important are the deleted scenes.  Sometimes the deleted scenes really deserve to be a part of an 'extended' version.  However, is was plain to me that these deleted scenes were justifiably cut from the theatrical release.  Some of the deleted scenes were redundant aerial shots that would have added nothing more to the film than the aerials already included in the release.  Some of these same scenes, and others, were clearly not finished in post production as some of them are the only scenes where you can notice blown out whites and artifacting in the water.  Other deleted scenes were interesting in that they further showed parts of the life of the crew's daily life or, in one scene, an extended build up to the movies flogging scene.  That this one was cut didn't seem to matter to me but it is also one that could have been included in the release.<br /><br />As I stated previously, it is the rare release where the Audio shares top billing with the video transfer. The DTS HD audio stands as one of, if not the best, of my growing Blu Ray collection replacing the standard DVDs I own.  Incredible and appropriate use of all 5 channels makes you feel as if you were on the ship itself. Yes, the battle scenes explode all around you as the cannons give a great workout for your sub woofer.  However, it is even in the quiet scenes below deck where the surrounds are still used to a great amount.  I have been on dive ships for most of the last 30 years and have grown accustomed to the sounds of a ship's creaking, anchoring chains and other ambient noise and the audio in Master and Commander replicates that audio ambience like no other I have seen or heard.  You really are immersed in the ship's hold with the rest of the crew as they eat and talk amongst themselves. The creaking and unseen tapping of metal on metal or silverware on plates comes through and envelopes you as if you were on board yourself.  Even the musical duets on cello and fiddle are beautifully spread across the sound stage with the cello on the left channel, spread across the center to the fiddle on the right channel with musical ambience across the rears.<br /><br />I just can't imagine any one being disappointed in the quality of the video and audio transfer.  They are that good and are only limited by the quality of your home theater to reproduce what the Blu Ray version provides.<br /><br />All my movie reviews are of this nature and focus only on the quality of the transfer to BluRay so check them and see if they are of help as well.<br />Hopefully, this review has been of some help to you in determining your purchase, hope I am on the correct path with a review of the transfer quality as opposed to providing plot summaries.<br />Thanksa great workout for your sub woofer.

145162445X|5.0|Lawrence Krauss is a master science writer.<br /><br />And here Krauss helps readers master not just one but two understandings:<br /><br />The first understanding Krauss helps readers master is probably best explained by Nobel laureate Steven Weinberg who said that science doesn't prevent you from believing in God but rather makes it possible to not believe in God. Or to quote that other nobel laureate Galileo: &#34;The book of nature is written in numbers.&#34; For Galileo the assertion that any book could supersede that provided by the church almost resulted in his death. For Krauss and Weinberg, however, that assertion is the key to understanding reality itself.<br /><br />It's here, with understanding reality itself that Krauss succeeds in his other mission: to lay out a picture of not just a self generating creation but a self generating creation from nothing itself. As to this story, you've probably already heard it from one science fiction program or another or from one science channel special or another...that the total energy of the universe is 0. It may have been explained to you that 0 can be something as long as we render as an equation. An example would some negative added to some equal positive on the other side of an equals sign from, that's right, a 0. In the various ways these calculations can be rendered to describe force and energy Krauss does an excellent job of making confusing science as least understandable in principle.<br /><br />Because this book does both its jobs so well and so briefly I believe this book may well someday be given its rightful place at the very top of popular science literature.

B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I've been using this app to store, edit and write short stories on my kindle.  it's been a great tool, especially when I don't have pens and paper on hand.  it also makes it easier to import to my Pc for fine tuning and back up storage.  save early, save often ;)
B006VRZ5YM|4.0|A nice love tale about not judging the book by the cover.  If you do than you may never meet the man or woman of your dreams.  A sweet love story with a happy ending.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|this is like a leprachaun version of Mario. And many people like Mario. So if u like Mario... GET THIS GAME
B0056BMK6K|5.0|I bought John Locke's book to learn his method of selling a million ebooks in five months. I am impressed with his immense success, and I commend him for his stragedy that worked for him. Way to go John.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|its okay and fits the bill. but not the hottest thing ever. it has all the features I expect and is entertaining.
B0058UXHHK|4.0|I thouroughly enjoyed Twenty-Eight and a Half Wishes. It was a nice, quick read (though it is a full length book I just found myself flipping page after page to read more.) The heroine is adorable and the 'hero' is...intriguing. The only thing that kept this from being a five star review was the amount of crying done by the main character. Granted, she is going through a lot of stressful situations, but halfway through the novel I stopped reading to think that she was crying an awful lot, and it wasn't even close to the last time that she did. It was distracting from what was a very good plot and story line. I am still glad that I read it and I will definitely be checking out more of the author's books.
B003VV8MW8|1.0|From about a minute into the episode, something goes wrong with the video and you can't see a thing. Very disappointing.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|Good game, reminds me of Mario... since I don't own a Ds ( lol ) I can now play my own version!
B005HSL626|2.0|makes me go to sleep for a whole day. it sucks. all you do is slice fruit. how boring is that??!!
B0058VW36U|5.0|I love this game, and it is simple enough for my 4-year-old son to play as well, with a little coaching. Very fun, I like it as much as Angry Birds.
B006OCM0G0|5.0|this game is fin and you do not need diamonds to get far i am lebel 13 without ddiamonds. add me my id is jadjul
B003H4RDZQ|1.0|My husband received this book from a co-worker and I finally got around to looking at it this month. The first story was okay but nothing brilliant or particularly funny. The 2nd was dumb. I didn't even want to read the rest of the stories and am selling my copy to Half Price books though I don't expect they will give me much for it.
B003XF1XOQ|1.0|The continuous whining, insecurity, and selfishness of Katniss was somewhat bearable in the first two books. I was hoping the author would mature her a little, as going through two Hunger Games would mature anybody. Not Katniss! She is constantly whining. She was my least favorite character in the whole book. The author has completely failed to portray her as the Che Guevara of Panem. She is more like the Paris Hilton of Panem.<br /><br />Also, the cheap trick of ending each chapter with a shocking revelation, got be be detestable. I thought maybe the author would stop her impersonation of M. Night Shyamalan, and just concentrate on writing the book rather than try really hard to give us a shocking twist in every chapter. It is extremely annoying that each chapter ends with some \\"shocking\\" twist. The author does not take time to develop the death of a character, but merely uses them as a cheap trick to lure you into the next chapter.<br /><br />If you are the type of person who likes the Vampire Diares and so on, this book is for you. I say that without any judgement, or pretentiousness. This book is not for the advanced reader.<br /><br />If the rebels needed someone like Katniss (what an ugly name for a heroine) in order to throw off slavery, then they deserved to be under Snow.
B0013HYLT0|4.0|Got this for my 4 year old after she watched the movie a couple times.  I put it on the old iPod touch I gave her after I got the phone.  This was about a month ago, and she still only wants to listen to only this music.  Good for her, perhaps a little grating on the adults, especially when she walks around with it, but it is decent music and she does love it.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|works great on the kindle fire.  very easy to use and great controller response.  just as addicting as super Mario bros.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|love it. it is a great game. just like Mario but with a cute little leprechaun. it is my favorite game
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|love it the first time I played I could not stop but it kinda sucks that u can only play with Wi-Fi
B007PTJOV0|5.0|its just like Mario brothers. I absolutely love thus game. it brings me back to when I was a kid and playing the nitindo.
B005GFPZYK|2.0|With the rise of the handgun from 65 million of them 20 years ago to over 130 million of them in the United States now, I said goodbye to honor. With the rise of the sniper I sealed it away for a day when we might want honor back in our lives again.<br /><br />I was able to watch Mr. Kyle's interview on CSPAN books, but have not yet read the book. This personal account is fascinating. However, I speculate that killing so many people must be a bit morality numbing for a human being. Unless a foundation of morality was not properly taught to begin with. In that case the sniper can be blissfully happy with his kills.<br /><br />Perhaps it is the morality of the Self that the sniper lives with? It's a strong morality in that it is reinforced constantly by the close majority, majorities in the sniper's life, the family, the church, the Republican party, and of course the guys.  \\"It does not hurt my family or me, and it won't even reach my family, and all the guys at the church do it and they even show it on Xbox, so it's moral!<br /><br />I play several online multi player first person shooter military games and there is no doubt Sniper is the most popular position to play, some rounds (10-30 minutes of play) I'll notice I'm out numbered 2-1 by kids hiding all over the place and playing sniper. For the sniper the thrill is fast and cheap of power and conquest and victory once you have downed an enemy in the back through a scope at 300 meters, completely unknown to him. This is not warfare, this is a pig shoot from over the fence into the pen.<br /><br />Early in online gaming I grew tired of running out into a yard or across a street at the beginning of my spawn just be shot in the back within 10 seconds by a 11 year old who gets those tiny shots of adrenaline and testosterone with each virtual  kill, and he's happy with himself because thinks he's found the perfect spot for plucking-off other players trying to actually do battle with their enemies. Honor among men was lost with the mass production of the firearm. We now shamelessly shoot each other from hiding spots, we shoot each other through convenience of easy access to our weapons and we do so thinking nothing of honor. This is why I coughed-up the $9 to change my Gamertag/name to SNIPERSnoHONOR on Xbox Live. A sniper who kills me gets instant mixed feelings, immediately he feels the glory of the honor less kill, and then the message on his screen: MrKillerEZ2 -----> SNIPERSnoHONOR. And he thinks,  \\"why that cocky bastard, he's saying I have no honor, just because I plugged him in the back of the head from 150 meters behind this rock looking through a high-power infrared targeting scope! That Bastard!\\" If a child never experiences honor, what disrespectful actions will be in his future? Many where honor may have stopped him, made him think twice, helped him to slow down and understand what he is about to do.<br /><br />I think honor gives integrity to the conscience in matters of the others in our lives. Honor lends respect to your enemy, a man most likely, not very different from you. Honor upholds respect from your peers. Honor means the means was as important to you as the target. A face to face stabbing through the heart, and a pause for your victim to see you are a person like him, is a killing with honor. A warrior does not have to have honorable intentions and he can still do everything he can to keep his kill honorable.<br /><br />I have to wonder if our game makers will ever consider the complete detachment from the concept of honor that this sniper position allows. Sniping is dirty business, it's ethically unclean and breeds an absence of honor. If I were an assasin I would use a knife at all possible opportunities. I would risk my life to get close to my enemy. Of course that's not what I would have been trained for, and that fantasy kill is just not set-up these days, to complicated. So many honor less ways to kill!<br /><br />I'm sorry Mr. Kyle if I have offendedyou. I thank you tremendously for risking your life for the desires of our government. Thank you for taking my place over there.you. I thank you tremendously for risking your life for the desires of our government. Thank you for taking my place over there.

B004UID2LC|5.0|I had wanted to download some Hunger Games parodies by alicecullengirl (Alice Christine)  I love them, and she made album only available on itunes.  (I have a Kindle Fire) I wanted them on my music library, instead of having to surf the 'tube.  I had thought this app just accessed YouTube.  But I finally checked it out.  And now I have all 16 for when ever.  Plus others like If I Die Young, Glad You Came, and Set Fire to the Rain.  And its all FREE!!!! :)  GET IT!!! :)) And if you like Hunger Games, check out alicecullengirl's channel! ;)
B0063IH60K|5.0|it is easy to use all  the features.  the hints help to understand other play options and options for type of deals is cool.
B005EGXTL2|2.0|Loved the Hunger Games and enjoyed Catching Fire, but found the final installment a real let down.<br /><br />The are two main reasons for this. The first is that there were story lines and characters developed in the first two books that were destroyed in a sentence or two, or simply ignored as though they never existed. Finnick, Johanna and Gale come to mind, as does the mission to get Snow. The second reason is that so much of the action happens away from Katniss. In choosing the first person narration, the author ought to have been conscious of how leaving the narrator out of crucial events can distance the audience from those events, from the main character and from the story itself.<br /><br />I hope the movies can improve on the lacklustre ending to a trilogy that began with such an interesting premise and so much promise.
B005HDK53W|1.0|Beautiful illustrations of a world gone by, suspect they will be lost on kids / kids of this generation. Pleases adults more than kids? Seems to be just a digital image of a double page - on the kindle iPad. So you can't see it well without zooming in to read the text, zooming out again, zooming in again to see the illustrations. If it's for the iPad - Don't buy it.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|nice game... like to see more soon. bring back more 80's early 90's games.... and more card, thinking games... keep up the good work guys.... okay I type the minimum.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|this game is fun and easy to play. I like it a lot. lep's world is awesome. try it for yourself.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I bought this book because of the hype, thinking I wasted 5 dollars. To my suprise this is a really good read. I read this book in 2 days where as I normally take 5-7 days per book;just could'nt put it down! No clues to anyone who is going to read this. Just prepare to be doing nothing except read for the next 2 days. First book i've read that I even wanted to leave a review for.  Enjoy!!!
0553386794|5.0|I really enjoyed the author's writing style and the plot of the novel.  He creates a complex plot throughout the imaginary world he's created which kept my interest.
B002HMHROQ|2.0|Calling an album of photographs an album is fine. Whether or not it's an organized agglomeration, it is a grouping of things.  sitting on the sofa, looking throughout them is something tolerated by boy-and girlfriends, siblings, and neighbors.<br />tolerated is the key here. When someone who sells you something presents an album, it should be listenable. This is yet another pile of half-finished dung proffered by Furman in an attempt to either continue a contract, or get a company to dump him and walk with the profits. either way, it's a mess.<br />His poor playing is propped up here by his guest guitarist, Quine. Mags like Rolling Stone and Playboy, and the popular press continue to prop up this shell of a person. Perhaps if he was destitute again he'd produce something of merit. Two approachable songs out of ten does not make an album.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|this is just like Mario I love it and if you like Mario you'll love it too and its free which is great so worth it
B0052UZIFA|5.0|Pros: Great graphics, builds up slow, advance through different level types, able to play a quick round in 10 minutes.<br /><br />Cons: None overall. Keep adding types of zombies and types of plants B-) Also, random extra levels or additional levels are always appreciated.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I really like this app! It's easy to use and easy to look up verses. I really like how you can compare different versions of the Bible with just a few taps on the screen.
B0071PS7AC|4.0|The game is challenging, I have not mastered throwing the curve ball yet. Considering I got the app for free it was definitely worth it.
B0070Z4M4I|2.0|I made it to about half way through the movie. The acting seemed \\"stiff\\" because of obviously attempting to imitate the previous plot of the Carpenter/Kurt Russell classic. The visual effects of the present remake were made for graphic gore/horror, rather than being an expression of an already building suspense -- a suspense which captivated the audience of Carpenter's work. I found the new version predictable and disappointing.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|Really a nice game. Reminds me to my Mario days. Its a real time killer. Download it and you will see.
B004LROMQG|4.0|I liked this season as much as the two earlier ones. It is fun to watch the new twists on the Merlin legend.The only weak episode (for me that is) is the goblin episode. But again it is unrealistic to expect all episodes to be perfect.
B007MNV5WU|2.0|Selected Angry Birds Space and Paid for Angry Birds Space....got Angry Birds Seasons!! What the? My star rating really isn't exactly fair because I'm not rating this game. I already have Seasons, so I'm bummed! I also have no idea how to correct this problem. Any suggestions?
B007PTJOV0|5.0|I really like this app it reminds me of playing Mario when I was younger.. lots of fun and entertainment
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|great story. Make sure you set aside plenty of read time, because you won't want to stop! The font changes everyone complains of only happened a few times and didn't really boher me.
B00785P2QC|4.0|cool game to keep you mind busy. could have more points easier to get with out buying them.overall good game. I like it.
B006ISJQBM|1.0|...then go buy a bottle of your favorite brand instead of dropping a dime on this torturous suckfest.<br /><br />This movie is long on venue and period-piece atmosphere, yet utterly lacking in characters who are interesting or plot development that addresses an event or person you might actually care about.<br /><br />Johnny Depp plays Kemp, a marginal New York journalist and wannabe novelist, who arrives in Puerto Rico to take a position at a struggling San Juan newspaper. He gets caught up in booze, tobacco and drug-addled intrigue in the form of financial shenanigans at his new newspaper, a shady real estate developer (and his intriguing lady friend...and see if you can guess whose bed she ends up in before movie's end), and lingering tensions between the natives and non-natives.<br /><br />At one point in the movie, Kemp comes within two feet of driving himself and the girlfriend off the end of the road and into the ocean after a high speed run in the real estate developer's Corvette. If only the brakes had faded; a dive into the Caribbean would have saved everybody involved from the remaining hour of misery.<br /><br />Consider carefully not only the cost of the DVD, but what two hours of your own time is worth before settling down with this disaster.
0312641893|4.0|The online lit world was recently thrown into conniptions by a post written by Joel Stein detailing why adults shouldn't read YA books. Allow me to introduce one of the best reasons I've ever seen to disregard Mr. Stein's advice: Cinder, a debut YA novel by Marissa Meyer.<br /><br />Cinder is a dystopian/Sci Fi take on the traditional fairytale of Cinderella, as well as being the first in a series titled \\"The Lunar Chronicles.\\" However, while Cinderella may form the most basic underpinnings of the novel, Cinder is so much more than what its fairytale ancestor might suggest. This is a smart, creative, beautifully written and imagined fantasy that grabs you from page one and just keeps on pulling you along. Cinder is one of the most appealing heroines in any book YA or otherwise that I've read in a long time. Meyer manages to make the teen cyborg self-sufficient and smart, but still sweet and giving. Unlike some of the more popular adult female protagonists such as Anita Blake (Laurell Hamilton's Vampire Hunter), Cinder isn't violent or cynical, but she is able to think for herself and protect herself. Equally interesting is Cinder's leading man, Kai. He is indeed the handsome prince, but he is also a real one, young, often uncertain, caring, and genuinely good-hearted. He is \\"in charge\\" enough to be appealing, but not some trite alpha male either.<br /><br />Aside from the stellar characterizations of Cinder and Kai, there is wonderful setting and even geo-political intrigue. While the secondary characters are fairly two-dimensional, the sense of place is detailed and the world creation is rich. \\"New Beijing\\" is believable because we've all seen present-day Asian cities that are incredibly dense and filled with blinking, buzzing, glowing electronics. The Asia described by Meyer is just one step further down the road from what we already know and therefore, not that difficult to imagine. The richness of the sci fi aspects of the novel lead me to believe that this isn't a fairytale for teen girls only. Girls might focus more on the interpersonal relationships in the book (Cinder and her stepsister Peony, Cinder and her best friend Iko the android, Cinder and Kai), but if boys aren't similarly interested, there's lots of gadgetry, technology and even a car to be fixed up. Cinder is one of those rare books that should be equally appealing to teen boys and girls, as well as their parents.<br /><br />If you only give your kid one book this year, make it Cinder. If you only read one YA book yourself this year, make it Cinder. If you're of any age, just looking for a fun, intelligent book to read, make it Cinder.
B006Z21ZJC|5.0|I must warn the reader that I may not be objective reviewing this product. Because I'm a Maiden fan since their early years and I always tend to rate their products with five stars. (Yes even their albums from the 1990's; many people believe those albums are weak in Maiden standarts).<br /><br />I live in Turkey and En Vivo DVD was released a few days late here. At the meantime, I -as many Maiden fans did - watched the songs in You Tube. But yet, I purchased the Limited Edition Steel Box. I believe many Maiden fans did the same.<br /><br />In 2011, when the Final Frontier album was announced, it was scary for two reasons: There was a resemblance with Pink Floyd's The Final Cut album. First, both albums included the word \\"final\\" in their title and second both albums included a song about a nuclear holocaust. (Two Suns in the Sunset in The Final Cut and When the Wild Wind Blows in The Final Frontier.) Some commentators claimed that The Final Frontier would be the last album in Maiden's career. But soon after the album was released, Maiden announced a World Tour called The Final Frontier Tour. It was a great chance for me to watch them live in the Sonisphere leg of the tour in Istanbul/Turkey. It was the best show I've ever seen so far.<br /><br />En Vivo was recorded in Santiago/Chile with the same list of songs. So, nothing new for those who watched Iron Maiden live in their World Tour. So what makes this DVD special?<br /><br />Let's review one by one:<br /><br />1. Nice album cover + booklet: I don't like seeing Eddie (Maiden's famous mascot) so disgusting in the album covers. My Favourite Eddie's are those in the Piece of Mind, Seventh Son of a Seventh Son, Somewhere in Time and A Matter of Life and Death album covers. In En Vivo's cover, we see Eddie with his huge teeth and small eyes at the upper half and Maiden on the stage at the lower half. Amazing Chilean fans are at the background. There's an 8 page booklet in the DVD, including the info about The Final Frontier World Tour, band members, special thanks, the \\"Killer Crew\\", etc, plus pictures from the show and that disgusting Eddie again.<br /><br />2. First DVD (Concert) : Then the show begins with an empty view of the Estadio Nacional Stadium of Santiago. Then the Ed Force airplane flows over the stadium and a lovely Latin lady screaming \\"Maideeeeen\\". Then comes the screen divided to three. We watch pieces from the Final Frontier clip, band members landing on Chile and the Maiden fans - always so hot and amazing, they are the best parts of the Maiden shows. Finally, the stadium is full and Bruce Dickinson's digital view appears, singing the first lines of The Final Frontier song. (Stars at the background) This is a very exciting start for the show. After the opening, the live show begins and from the very begining of the concert, you feel the taste of a great Rock band.<br /><br />The song selection may be discussed. Many Maiden fans would like to hear the songs such as Aces High, Run to the Hills, The Rime of the Ancient Mariner from the earlier period or songs such as Isle of Avalon, Starblind from The Final Frontier album. But, hey guys ! Remember, Iron Maiden can organize a concert and play all the songs available in their career and yet, Maiden fans would demand more and more. If I should criticize En Vivo DVD, it would be that: Why there's no song from A Matter of Life and Death album? (I think it's one of the best albums in Maiden's career.)<br /><br />My favourite songs from En Vivo album are The Talisman, Dance of Death, Blood Brothers, When the Wild Wind Blows, Fear of the Dark and Hallowed Be Thy Name. I don't mean the other songs are performed bad. But I think, Maiden performance is at the height, especially in Talisman, Dance of Death and Fear of the Dark. Bruce Dickinson is more than a singer; almost an actor. Dave Murray, Adrian Smith and Jannick Gers are perfect. Nicko is Nicko (any comment needed?) and Steve Harris is unbelievable. I am younger than all the members of the band and I can't believe how energetic they are, at the stage.<br /><br />A walking Eddie appears in The Evil That Men Do. Then a giant Eddie appears behind the stage in the song Iron maiden, again. The last song is from the \\"Jurassic Park Period\\" of the band: Running Free. I think it was funny to close the show with that song. At least Maiden fans have hope now that Maiden will not disband and make new albums. (\\"2012 - Maiden England\\" tour was already announced.)<br /><br />3. Second DVD (Behind the Beast) : As the name implies, this DVD is about the behind of the stage. I'm sure Maiden fans would like to see how that excellent show was planned from the very beginning in full details.<br /><br />Finally ... We always ask ourselves: Why should I buy this product? My answer for En vivo is simple: This is the height in Maiden's carreer. If you're a Rocker, you have to own this DVD. Iron Maiden products are always worth of buying, and this is the best so far.ll the members of the band and I can't believe how energetic they are, at the stage.<br /><br />A walking Eddie appears in The Evil That Men Do.

140131046X|5.0|I picked this book up at a thrift store, so it won't show up as an amazon verified purchase.  It's a super quick read. The book starts out with the author being asked the question, \\"Will you write my Eulogy?\\" This is a person (I don't want to tell you who it is, I want you to read the book) who the author has known all his life. The author knew who he was and what he did, but he didn't know who the person really was.  Within the years after being asked the question the author spends time with this person and really gets to know him.  The book is based on a true story.  I absolutely loved it and think you will too.
B000FC13Y0|4.0|Stardust is a modern fairytale written by Neil Gaiman. It is about a young man on a quest, full of quirky characters including a witch who changes animals into human servants for herself. This author has a gift in writing off-beat stories with strange characters, and unexpected endings. I read this book as an audiobook, read by the author--he did an excellent job with the narration.<br /><br />I really enjoyed this book and recommend it for those who enjoy fairy tales and the fantasy genre of books. There is adults themes in this book, children will most likely not easily understand and may become bored; adults should appreciate it's cleverness.
0062011847|5.0|Grade: A+ (gold standard)<br />Why I picked it up: Because Pratchett is a god of writing and I will blindly read anything he writes, anticipating some daft comedy.<br /><br />The Story: Terry Pratchett's latest Discworld novel features Sam Vimes forced to visit the family countryside Manor by his wife. Out of his comfort zone of the streets of Ankh Morpork, Vimes sets out to explore the pastoral village with his son, 6 year old Young Sam.<br /> Taking the hero into a new location and having a murder happen is a tried and tested plot device (think Agatha Christie, Dorothy Sayers). This is even better here in Discworld, as the location is just like pastoral England, but with Goblins! He gets mixed up with local magistrates, a one-man constabulary - and wins the day after a chase across caves, land and a wild river; what fun!<br /><br />I loved the tongue-in-cheek reference to Jane Austen that was sneaked into Sam's meetings with the local populace.<br />(Read and find out!)<br />I'd recommend this to:  Everyone!<br />Please remember, you can read this series out of order - don't be intimidated by the sheer number of books in Discworld!<br />Digital galley received courtesy of NetGalley & Harper Collins Publishers.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|These are the current it books everyone is reading. I'll spare a synopsis since there are so many reviews already. I needed something not to serious to read so jumped on the bandwagon and picked these up. I saw it mentioned that these started as Twilight Fan-fic which is painfully obvious in the beginning but as the book progresses it becomes its own story. Yes many parts of the book I found myself laughing and thinking what am i reading and why but it kept me interested and reading and I immediately started the second one so that alone would give it 3 stars. I thought the characters were interesting. From the beginning I thought it was obvious there was possibly some deeper problems with Christian that lead him to lead the life he does. This mystery kept me reading. I also liked Anastasia yes like Bella she becomes engrossed and possibly oobsessed with Christian and may be too accepting of a strange situation. However she is able so see the bigger picture and realize shes maybe falling down the rabbit hole and she is not exactly getting involved in the best of situations. Regardless of her actions its nice to see shes questioning her situation even if sometimes its only to herself. These books are not the next great literary masterpiece but they are an entertaining read.
141690977X|2.0|I have yet to find a relationship book that doesn't sugarcoat the truths. It will be difficult, because those truths are ugly. To every situation this book offers a comforting answer that \\"he is not into you\\", while it doesnt anwer the most burning question \\"why\\" and all these women happily continue to make the same mistake again. A few times this book had shining moments, like that guys would be glad to destroy \\"friendship\\" for sex, but they are so shy they almost go unnoticed. You will never learn anything useful from this.

1451627289|1.0|I have slogged through 560 pages of this ridiculously overwrought novel and two things stick out in my mind.<br /><br />First, why didn't the publisher edit the book? There are so many inconsistencies and screw-ups in the narrative, I can't believe it. Like the time the lady had her brains bashed in by her killer husband, only to have fully recovered in the next chapter. Who the hell does King think he's kidding?<br /><br />Has he made so much money on his blood and gore thrillers, that he thinks he can get away with this trash, or has his publisher relinquished all editing responsibilities because King's mere name on his novels generates millions. Readers aren't stupid. I don't know, but getting away with these blatant errors leaves the reader baffled and confused. Not only is this the height of sloppiness and narcissism on King's part, but it proves that he or his publisher no longer care about putting out a quality product. Life's too short to read such garbage. I liked the 'Stand' but that's about it. He never advanced much as a writer, and when has money ever been the standard of excellence?

0439023521|5.0|This is not my favored genre, or classic literature.  But there was something about all the hype and all the older people who read it and could not put it down.  I'm still amazed that as soon as I got a few chapters in, I also stayed up one night until I could read no longer, because I could not put it down.  All I can say is:  Me?  This book?  It is a five.

B004124VG2|4.0|The Age of Adz is a fantastic album, showcasing Stevens' reinvention of his musical palette. Most people know him for his wistful, meticulous songwriting from his album Michigan and his most popular album Illinois. However, that's not all he's done as a musician. The oft-forgeten Enjoy Your Rabbit shows a different side of Sufjan, all glitch and mad rhythm. The Age of Adz is the offspring of his earlier tinkering in electronica. Banjos and hushed ballads are blasted away in drum loops and heavy brass. The same feverish attention to detail is present, with flute trills rolling wildly through the instrumentation and choral descants wavering over his digital beeps and squeals.<br /><br />The album uses the apocalyptic artwork of Royal Robertson (whose work is featured on the cover and vinyl sleeves) as a starting point. The album sets itself up as a hysterical dream, with melodrama, sickness, volcanoes, and death thrashing between two soft, acoustical pieces which bookend the beast. One of the most intense, emotive moments on the album crashes into you with Stevens wailing \\"I'm not f******g around\\" on the song I Want to be Well. Other attention worthy moments: he manages a electro-pop song in 7/4! He composes electronica/a capella! And of course, the back end of the album, his Impossible Soul, which weighs in at a broad 25 minutes. Although an intimidating length, he overfills it with more motifs, textures, and ideas than you'll find in many artist's whole albums (he even whips out autotune for a few bars!).<br /><br />The only issue I could find is not with the music of the album itself, but rather its format on vinyl. In order to fit Impossible Soul on Side D of the vinyl release, its very last section had to be moved around. The proper end is called Pleasure Principle, which you'll find earlier in the album. Still, I'm so happy to have it in a physical format. If you want to test out The Age of Adz, consider looking these up on youtube:<br /><br />Futile Devices<br/>Too Much<br />Get Real, Get Right<br />I Want to Be Well<br />Pleasure Principle

0061122416|2.0|Let me just start you off with a couple of quotes from the book.  \\"That she was waiting for him, a woman awaiting a courageous man in search of his treasure.  Form that day on, the desert would represent only one thing to her: the hope for his return.\\"<br /><br />\\"She knows that men have to go away in order to return.  And she already her her treasure: it's you.\\"<br /><br />From this and many other cues, such as all of the protagonist's teachers along the way are men, it is unmistakably clear that Men have spiritual journeys and that their Women are so stinkin' happy to have men that are truly living their life that they will wait patiently for their possible return.  I am not pleased that my daughter will once again be handed this message that women are there to support men on their \\"Personal Journeys.\\"  Blech.  Reminiscent of Snow White, \\"I'm waiting for the one I love...to find me...ahahahahahahh, etc.\\"<br /><br />It actually has some good points but as a mother of a teenage daughter this trumps any other St. Exupery whimsy that I may have found.  If you don't have any care about gender equality, then by all means enjoy.  The author is actually quite generous about sharing his material for free on the internet. I hope in his own spiritual search he can write a book from a woman's perspective.  I know you say, he is not one, so it is not possible.  He wrote from a shepherd's perspective and from a Muslim's.  I have faith he can also see through a woman's eyes.

B007PTJOV0|3.0|this is a great game but basically is a super mario game for your tablet. The leperchan is  mario his gold (princess peach) is taken by a tornado (bowser) and he goes off on an adventure to claim it back. the worlds are shorter though and apparently the creators of this game are very lazy because all of the worlds are basically the same. it is ok for time wasting but i played it for 15 minutes and found it to be an extremely boring mario brothers rip-off. (doesnt mario brothers have a copyright?) if you want a good game dont purchase this because it will just take up space on your device.

B002MQYOFW|1.0|The thought of killing teenage kids in a game sickens me. Even if it is just a story. To think  how this is accepted so widely as the best book since Harry Potter shows  the dumbing down of society. No compassion for  your  fellow man dying. Not like the paint ball hunting game but taking a life and the public is eating it up. Give me a break.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|It seems that all the the things the author did were fine...until the initial large battles abated after the first three books.  Then the same \\"critics\\" decided everything was wrong, from style to the amount of description included.  For my part, I found this book fascinating in its portrayal of events that are widely separated, but closely related.  The introduction of new cultures on the Eastern Continent would not have been half as interesting if what made them unique, was not included.  That includes, what they ate, how they dressed and acted, and what maladies they had.  When you are dealing with a culture on a different world, all the description aids the mind in forming a picture.  I had a lot of good reading in this book.  It made other authors look like they were rushing to finish.<br /><br />As usual, having good intentions is not the only criterion for success of the characters.  The characters are not static.  Some learn from their experience and some don't  What they learn does not necessarily serve them well, much as happens in real life.  I, for one am eagerly looking forward to the next installment.  Winter has now arrived and survival will not be easy.

B004XZR63M|4.0|The author has presented the income-expenses-assets-liabilities personal finance structure, which is really accurate. There are many really good points made - about learning, work and the way people live.<br /><br />I find some of the examples a bit strange though. For example I don't agree that buying and selling real estate makes passive income, it requires studying the market constantly. If you buy real estate and rent it out - now that's passive income.<br /><br />Anyway, anyone can learn a lot from this book, no matter what they do for a living.
B00000G3PL|4.0|I have always enjoyed the Lethal Weapon movies, they seem to have a little of everything, action, comedy, suspense and drama.  Well rounded movies that deliver great entertainment time and time again.  It's hard to really compare them to any other series of films, maybe they remind me of the Naked Gun movie series a little, but much better and relevant.  I still think these are Mel Gibson's best film work to date except for maybe Ransom.<br /><br />Peter J. Miller

B005K15SPG|5.0|Mumford & Sons is one of those rare bands that does something unique and breaks through the garbage the 4 main music companies have created in today's music monopoly. This band really cares about their music and genuine lyrics go along with unique genuine music.<br />This cd includes 2 CDs and 1 DVD. The CDs include 1 studio cd and 1 live cd. There are a couple songs that are different on each album but the majority are the same. The DVD is short and includes a couple parts of the band touring and talking about the album but you have to log on online to get the last part. (which I probably never will as I don't like signing up for anything)<br />This version is definitely worth buying over the basic album as it's only a few dollars more and every song on both CDs is now in my iPod play list. The live songs have enough differences in them that it doesn't get monotonous listening through both of them. The DVD although short, was very well done and I appreciate this band more after seeing it.

B003XF1XOQ|4.0|I was planning to write just the one review of the entire series, but so many people are beating up on this installment that I feel compelled to come to its (partial) defense.  To do this, I have to spoil the thing, so if you're caught up in the excitement, let me say it IS worth buying, and the ending IS NOT the disaster lots of reviewers felt it was.<br /><br />OK, my reaction to the other critics is overall agreement, with some caveats.  First off, Katniss is neither unfeeling nor inmature, and she DOES go through a full process of deciding to become the Mockingjay.  For those of you who find this predictable I say \\"Yes, it is, but so are lots of things in life (thank goodness).\\"  Collins does a perfectly adequate job of making Katniss' mental process believable, and if your dislike for her predates the events of \\"Mockingjay,\\" that just shows how wonderfuly drawn her character has been all along.<br /><br />About the emphasis on the war, isn't it about time Snow's regime came tumbling down?  If anything, this should have started in Catching Fire, which spent its whole second half in the arena.  If you have to beat up on one of these books, let it be that one since the Quarter Quells were clearly invented after the first book proved popular enough to warrant a sequel, to say nothing of the fact that Peta couldn't volunteer for Haymitch since it has already been explicitly stated that only relatives can do so.<br /><br />On the love triangle: The only reason Katniss is torn at all is that she's never been sure Peta really loves her, and she has been tamping down her feelings for him in case she ends up having to kill him.  Damn smart for an \\"immature, unfeeling\\" young lady!<br /><br />On how the book ends: I buy it completely, and find it both satisfying and believable.  Katniss and Peta end up together, but the war has changed them both, so their relationship can never be completely uncomplicated.  And yes, though predictable their ending up together is the least payoff Collins could get away with.  I don't know about you, but I was rooting for these two from the moment Peta tells Cesar Flickerman he brought his secret love with him to the capitol.  Really, how could you not?  And the killings of Finnick and Prim?  They were completely believable as acts of war, as was Katniss' temporary willingness to go along with one more hunger games.  In a totally realistic treatment (such as I recommend to Collins in my review of the whole series)she might well have shot Snow and become the gamemaker for that event, but I'm glad she found the moral courage to spare his life.  What would have been even better than killing Coin would have been if she drew her bow...and shot right over Snow's head, perhaps even pinning his hair to whatever backdrop he was probably positioned against, then walked over to him, gotten right in his face and calmly but firmly, in a voice loud enough for all to hear pardoned him, but then condemed him to a lifetime of low-level service to all his surviving victims -- made him a symbolic avox.<br /><br />No, the only flaw I find in this whole book (apart from the effects of Collins not having drawn a truly realistic dystopia in the first place) is that when Haymitch asks the war council which moments have been Katniss finest, absolutely nobody says: \\"Her moments of tenderness.\\"  I gave her a Purple Heart for how she behaved toward the peacekeeper who asked why he shouldn't shoot her; could any of us be sure we'd remain nonviolent to the end in circumstances like these?<br /><br />Yes, Mockingjay is as good as the rest of the series.  Give it a try!payoff Collins could get away with.

This is a thank-you note with some advice on how to make your next effort even better!<br /><br />First, a little bit about me.  I love strong female leads, stories set in the future and ones involving the fight against tyranny.  And I know this is fiction, so I have to suspend my disbelief.<br /><br />But you have to make it easier for me to do that by really creating a detailed picture of the world you have created for me...one every bit as full-bodied as any setting on our present world map you might have chosen for something other than an SF novel.  That would have prevented you from presenting both President Snow and the writer of his \\"Why We Have The Hunger Games\\" propo as harmless dolts with Wonder Woman's magic lasso around them!  To paraphrase a line from another book I just finished reading, \\"How do you get the people of Panem to participate in the Hunger Games?  You LIE to them!<br /><br />Remember, Suzanne: Katniss' actions spring from her motives, which in turn can only be based on two things: her personality and the \\"actual\\" situations in which she finds herself - the myriad \\"realities\\", both momentous and mundane, of the world in which she has grown up.  Let's pretend you'd written HG the way I'm suggesting: Mightn't Katniss be THRILLED to be going to the arena?  For that matter, might this not even perhaps be Prim's coming of age story?  Assume all of Panem has bought into some semireligious rationale for the games: How much deeper (and scarier!) might this whole thing have been if - as so often in real life - the biggest battle the tributes-turned-rebels had to fight was against their own desire for glory, their own hand not just in the deaths of their peers in the arena, but in actively promoting both the games and the very regime which holds them every year?<br /><br />I don't think you're lazy, Suzanne, though it might not have occurred to you to write yourself a virtual Country Guide for Panem like the (U.S.) Foreign Service does, filled with \\"facts\\" not intended for inclusion in the trilogy.  But as you've written it, the story could only start on the first ever Reaping Day; then I could buy Snow telling the districts something like: \\"You rebelled, we had to stop you for our collective good as a society, and because the war has disrupted the whole nation by killing our top military strategist, we need a new one...whom we're going to pick from one of your districts, which district will be granted complete amnesty for its crimes against the nation.  Send us your best: Only one may have the honor.\\"<br /><br />Notice that even at this, you'd have to do some pretty fancy footwork to explain why each district has to serve up TWO tributes.  I understand why you needed it as a plot device, but in what sort of world would this really make sense?  All in all, having just one tribute per district and making Peta be from another one would have been more believable.<br /><br />So, Suzanne, next time you create a post-apocalypse world for us, PLEASE ask yourself if everything you write in and about it is truly believable.  Notice I didn't say: \\"....whether or not you believe it yourself\\"; we're all too caught up in our own work to have that much objectivity.  But you can ask yourself a couple dozen questions about what has happened before the story starts, how the government is structured and what lies it tells before you begin.  Or, with considerably more effort, you might be able to work backwards, starting with how you want your characters to come off, and a few key plot points to which you are fully committed.  I think, though, that this would be a mistake, and everything I've ever read on the process of creating says that when you're in the zone, it should just flow out of you.  I've read more than one great artist (musical and literary) say they had no control once inspiration struck.  I know that's not so convenient when you're planning out a trilogy, much less a major motion picture and a bunch of related merchandise.  As it stands, your Hunger Games series is ALMOST worthy of all that attention, Suzanne, and I want to add that I'm lucky to find one single book per year that I can't put down, much less three worth stealing homework time from (I'm a graduate student), so I'm not just writing this out of jealousy or envy.  You've got a lot of potential to produce something truly brilliant, Suzanne, but this time you get just an A- for your efforts.<br /><br />You can have an A+ next time, Suzanne.  Just keep it all absolutely real.  Don't force anything whatsoever.  Then you'll have truly written the book - or series - we all love to be scared out of our wits by.  You might even find yourself being counted among the ranks of the very best SF writers of all time.e read more than one great artist (musical and literary) say they had no control once inspiration struck.

1439192812|4.0|I grew up in a religious household, so science was never emphasized and I always felt secretly ashamed for \\"believing\\" in evolution. I \\"tuned out\\" for most of my life when I sat in science class. Reading this book introduced me to concepts that, believe it or not, at 28 years old, I had never fully conceptualized or considered. I especially enjoyed learning about the different myths associated with each question at the beginning of each chapter, and then reading on to understand the scientific explanation. Admittedly, I was lost when he began talking, at length, about gasses or the elements, but other chapters were thoroughly engaging. I read and re-read the chapter on evolution, how other animals including fish are our distant cousins. I would often pause and sit for a while to ponder what I had just read. I felt a connectedness with all life forms that I've not previously felt. I devoured the chapter on what makes a rainbow, and read with delighted interest about his theory of life on other planets and how he intelligently deals with questions about why bad things happen and what a miracle really is.<br /><br />Thoroughly enjoyed!
098478280X|5.0|I'm a senior graduating college and I had interviews at Facebook, Apple, Twitter, Amazon, and this book really helped a lot in preparing me for my interviews, as well as her website [...]. I would also HIGHLY recommend her iPhone app, because the short videos she has are also very good.
0439023521|2.0|I should preface this review by saying that I read a lot, and am drawn to engaging, poetic prose with intellectual concepts that really get me thinking. I was not the target audience for this series. However, because of all the acclaim, I decided to read the first book.<br /><br />Possible spoilers, although only on minor plot points:<br /><br />I like a book where I can learn a new word or two, or struggle with an intriguing ethical dilemma, or connect with the characters' emotional complexities. This book had none of that. The plot of this story was highly implausible. The rule changes, the lack of emotion in the characters or their families, the fact that in a fight to the death, a character would actually let Katniss run away because he \\"owed her one\\" (referring to Flesh) was just unbelievable. Flesh had her on the ground. Are we really to believe that he would just let her go so easily, knowing eventually she'd become his predator?<br /><br />The love story between Peeta and Katniss, though undoubtedly essential to the story, bored me to tears. I couldn't have been the only adult reader wishing their little adolescent romance would progress, even to a simple steamy make-out session, on one of those cool nights when they lay huddled together in the cave.<br /><br />I felt like every opportunity the author had to show us different facets of Katniss' character was lost. Instead of killing people directly, Katniss barely killed in this story. And when she did, as stated, it was in an indirect manner. She was mainly on the defense and killed in order to survive, instead of preying on her competitors. I would have liked to see her befriend Rue and then come face-to-face with choosing between Rue's life or her own. No cop-outs: if she had killed Rue or even Peeta, I would have been sold. I would have been invested. I would have felt the anguish, the terror, the trauma of her experience. But instead, everything was all too easy: she was a skilled hunter and had the advantage of a fabricated love story with Peeta to win her the approval of her benefactors. Even the few other characters that we DO get to know are murdered off by other undeveloped characters we don't care about. Give me something to care about!<br /><br />I may sound crazy for saying this, but the novel just wasn't dark enough for me.antage of a fabricated love story with Peeta to win her the approval of her benefactors.

B004EBT5CU|4.0|I, for the most part, am a fan of classic rock and roll.  It's not often that an artist of today's times comes by and catches my ear the way Adele has.  I bought this piece for \\"Rolling in the Deep,\\"  but was pleasantly surprised to find out that this entire album was an absolute joy to listen to.  Go on, Adele...make a joyful noise!
0307352145|4.0|As an introvert who checked off every single box on her questionnaire in one of the earlier chapters, I enjoyed reading this book. This book actually reassured me, showing me the biological connection to my social awkwardness. I'm not a misanthropist, I am just highly sensitive to human emotions and actions, making it difficult for me to regularly interact with others. I feel overwhelmed in the presence of others, feel drained and tired after social events, and shut down when I'm forced to work with others. I just wish all my graduate school instructors would read this book so they understand why I cringe when they put us in groups! I am a teacher myself, and this book gave me a new-found appreciation for students who produce better results and are generally more successful when working alone. Overall, it made me question the push towards open-office plans and cooperative learning, and she does a good job of explaining the rise towards the \\"extrovert ideal,\\" in spite of the many geniuses in history who have been introverts (think Gandhi).<br /><br />Intriguing and compelling, even if it did drag on a little towards the end.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|This game is very fun. It is very similar to Mario.  Get this game or you will regret it.  It is one of the best
B0050DIWFC|4.0|I thought this was a well written book and it certainly kept my interest during my reading sessions.<br />Pros:<br />Entertaining page turner.  Though you see the freight train coming, you still want to see it frame by frame through all of the carnage.  It deals with so many currently relevant topics.  Kids and the internet.  Kids. Oblivious parenting.  How one would deal with a child that was accused of murdering a school mate.  The social and personal side of such a traumatic accusation. I thought it was a 5 star book all the way up to the ending.<br />CONS:<br />The not so relevant/believable topics of murder genes and oblivious ADA fathers.  I will say that I wasn't as shocked by the twists and turns but they certainly added to the intrigue of it all.  I do agree with others about the repetiveness of it all. By the end I had enough of the narrator and him telling his version of the story.  As the book moved along I lost respect for him with every turning page.  Maybe I just perceive prosecutors to be too cynical to become such enablers and just live with their heads in the sand.  I would have liked to get a better insight of the mother's point of view, but that was exactly the point of the ending...I think at least.<br /><br />Whatever the case it was an entertaining book and as a parent lets just say the kids' ipods and laptops are being monitored a little closely this morning.  Happy Easter kids now let me see your phones and all electronic devices please.

B00192KCQ0|5.0|One could call Death Magnetic Kirk Hammett's revenge. Famously browbeaten into accepting Lars Ulrich and producers Bob Rock's dictum that guitar solos were \\"dated\\" and thereby verboten for 2003's St. Anger -- a fraught recording chronicled on the 2004 documentary Some Kind of Monster -- Metallica's lead guitarist dominates this 2008 sequel, playing with an euphoric fury not heard in years, if not decades. This aesthetic shift isn't because Hammett suddenly rules the band: powerless to add solos to St. Anger, he couldn't reinstate them without the blessing of Ulrich and James Hetfield, the politburo of Metallica. The duo suffered some combination of shame and humility in the wake of the muddled St. Anger and Monster, convincing these two unmovable forces to change direction. They ditched longtime producer Rock -- who'd helmed every album since 1991's breakthrough blockbuster Metallica -- in favor of Rick Rubin, patron saint of all veteran rockers looking to reconnect with their early spark. Rubin may be the go-to producer for wayward superstars but as the producer of Slayer, he's also rooted in thrash, so he understands the core of Metallica's greatness and gently steers them back to basics on Death Magnetic.<br /><br />Of course, Metallica's basics are pretty complex: intertwined guitar riffs, frenetic solos, and thunderous double-bass drums stitched together as intricate seven-minute suites. Metallica slowly weaned themselves away from labyrinthine metal during the '90s, tempering their intensity, straightening out riffs, spending nearly as much time exploring detours as driving the main road, all the while losing sight of their identity. This culminated in the confused St. Anger, a transparent and botched attempt at returning to their roots, crippled by the chaos surrounding the departure of bassist Jason Newsted. With all their problems sorted out in public -- including replacing Newsted with Robert Trujillo, who acquiesces to the Metallica custom of being buried far, far in the mix -- the group embraces every gnarled, ugly thing they eschewed in the years since \\"Metallica.\\" Death Magnetic bounces the band back to the days before Bob Rock, roughly sounding as if it could come after ...And Justice for All. Such a deliberate revival of the glory days can be tricky, as it could make a group seem stuck in the past -- or, just as badly, they can get essential elements wrong -- but Death Magnetic is a resounding success because they hunker down and embrace their core strengths, recognizing that their greatest asset is that nobody else makes noise in the same way as they do.far, far in the mix -- the group embraces every gnarled, ugly thing they eschewed in the years since \\"Metallica.\\" Death Magnetic bounces the band back to the days before Bob Rock, roughly sounding as if it could come after ...And Justice for All.

B005K0HDGE|5.0|What if you had the opportunity to go back in time and try to stop one of the worst events in recent history from occurring?  Would you do it?  Even if there could be unpredictable and possibly disastrous consequences as a result?<br /><br />In only his second attempt at a non-horror novel, Stephen King poses exactly this question, and then tries to answer it.  The event in question is the assassination of John F Kennedy on November 22, 1963.  King does not attempt to answer the question of whether Lee Harvey Oswald acted alone, or with others, or was simply the patsy in a grand conspiracy.  He \\"goes with the flow\\" and assumes that Oswald was the lone assassin.<br /><br />Along the way, King posits some theories about time travel that make a great deal of sense - some of which, believe it or not, I first read about in comic books as a kid.  He also appears to be a fan of the so-called \\"butterfly effect\\" - the theory that if a butterfly flaps its wings in, say, New Mexico, it could cause a disastrous earthquake in, for example, Miami.<br /><br />To be brief, King's protagonist, schoolteacher Jake Epping, goes back in time to 1958 with the intention of preventing the assassination of Kennedy five years later.  While waiting for the fateful day, he creates a new life for himself and falls in love.  What will this do to his future?  And will he be able to prevent it, or does history have a way of keeping itself on course?<br /><br />Epping's new life makes for a very interesting and absorbing tale, and I won't spoil things by saying whether or not he manages to stop Oswald - but I will say that King cops out big-time when Jake returns to the future.  He could have crafted a completely separate (but linked) novel about Jake's adventures in his revised present.  Perhaps he will.  If he does I'll definitely buy it.<br /><br />King does not abandon his base - the supernatural.  There are definite supernatural elements in \\"11/22/63\\", but there is no monster, no boogeyman outto eat anyone's face - although there is a link to one of his minor works early on (I'll leave it to you to discover which one).<br /><br />One final thing.  I mentioned earlier that this is only King's second non-horror novel - the first being \\"The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon\\".  Yes, he's written other non-horror stories, several of which have been very good and very well-received.  But those have all been novellas or short stories, not novels.<br /><br />In any case this is definitely a more-than-worthy addition to the King canon.
0307949508|4.0|The second in the series, 'Fire', relies heavily on information from 'the Dragon Tattoo'. Having read the first enhances the descriptions, but I'm not at a loss without it. I was captivated by Salander au naturel but her refashioned persona lends to the story line. The activities of Lisbeth are a highlight; but the affairs of the magazine and staff remind us that this is the Millennium Trilogy. Scenery, scenario and 'adjective play' make sequences come to life with suspenseful continuity. The details within the mystery could turn any journalist into a detective, as with the supporting lead of Mikael Blomkvist. Larsson has done a nice job of chiseling a world class sequel that tours the underworld with bravado.
0439023521|4.0|There is hardly a need to summarize the plot of the Hunger Games. It is well known: For entertainment of the ruling class, each year 24 children are selected to compete in a televised battle in which only one can survive. The book has become an international cultural phenomenon, similar to Harry Potter in the stir that it has caused. Given this level of hype, I could not wait to read it. But I must say I had a mixed reaction. First, let me say that Collins, the author of the book, definitely knows how to \\"turn a phrase\\" and has written a gripping, exciting and complex story. Parts of the book will hold your attention and not let go (be ready to stay up late reading!). But some parts are \\"oh so slow\\". After the final battle of the Hunger Games, the book grinds to a slow death. The climax of the book is a letdown. I do not even know if you can call it an ending. It is just a weak prequel to the sequel. Nevertheless, you need to read this novel. If you don't, you will be the only person on your block who hasn't read it.<br /><br />The major strength of the book is its female lead, Katniss Everdeen, who is strong and resourceful, and self-reliant. The book blasts straight through gender stereotypes like a bulldozer. The bow-wielding heroine Katniss is a true female hero who is emotionally and physically strong, and more than knows how to survive on her own. She does not need a man to protect her, and in fact, she feels compelled to protect the boy. The closest analogy for a positive heroine is Ripley in the film Alien.<br /><br />The part of the book that I found less than satisfying was Katniss's relationship with her male companion, Peeta. Peeta saves Katniss's life multiple times, but she can never bring herself to fully trust him...or love him. She flip-flops back and forth throughout the book. She loves him, she doesn't love him.... Even to the very end of the book she is still questioning whether she can trust him or love him. This need for love, which she constantly rejects, undermines her forceful, self-reliant image. I would have preferred a female hero who was not constantly worrying about male acceptance and love. I wanted a gender-neutral hero who takes control and does the job she has to do. Was John McLane in Die Hard always wondering whether he loved is wife or not? No, He just killed the bad guys! I can only guess this ambivalence is necessary to set up romantic tension in the two sequels to the book.<br /><br />One reviewer says, I think the violence is too much for a young adult novel. I totally disagree. Where is the violence? Katniss stays alive, not by courting violence, but by avoiding it. In fact, during the entire narrative, she doesn't kill anyone she does not have to, except maybe once where she kills out of mercy.<br /><br />The Hunger Games won several awards and was a New York Times bestseller. As a result of the significant popularity of The Hunger Games books, Collins was named one of Time magazine's most influential people of 2010. Collins is the best-selling Kindle author of all time.

I just had to write and voice my opinion on this stupid book, I am so mad that this author is getting this much publicity over such a poorly written novel. The book is seriously at a 4th grade level as far as vocabulary and is very repetitive( I looked up at him through my lashes - at least 5 times) and just plain dumb. I was more turned off than turned on and only finished it to see if it got any better. IT DIDN\\"T !!!!!<br />Do not waste your money or time, I will be telling everyone I know NOT to read this book.

B003XF1XOQ|3.0|The third book of the series did not capture my interest as did books 1 and 2. My son argues that Mockingjay is mostly falling action to create the ending and didn't require the action that the first books needed.  I got the same feeling I had with the last Harry Potter Book movie Harry potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1.  However, there where still moments in Mockingjay that I didn't expect and was pleasantly surprised.

0345803485|4.0|I will start off with what I would term at the cons, and this is what some others have already posted so I'll try to be brief.<br /><br />Yes, the author does tend to be repetitious at times. You read this story from the female's point of view, and one would think that by the end of 500 pages she could come up with different descriptives, instead of continually repeating the same comments.<br /><br />By the end of the book (and by the amount of experience she does gain at this point), one would think she would actually refer to her private anatomy parts by something other than \\"down there\\".<br /><br />Also (and call it just me here), I found that I didn't like the way the author would spend pages building the tension leading up to the actual sex scene, and then it seemed as if neither character could last more than a few seconds. While I enjoyed the lead up, it would have been nice (and more fulfilling) if the author spent just a wee bit longer on the actual scene to make it a bit more worthy. I felt a bit deprived &lt;shrug>.<br /><br />Not huge issues in my book, but all in all does warrant a star off as all of these issues put together were a little annoying.<br /><br />Now on to the rest of the story: Not having any experience myself into this type of lifestyle I will state that I have been curious to learn more. I cannot vouch for any validity or relevance into Christian's ideas (meaning, is this completely fantasy or do 'real' Doms/Subs treat their relationships this way?). All I know is that I made this journey with Ana, I had some of the same issues she did along the way, as well as some of the same responses. By the end of the book I found myself mentally exhauted (or would the term be sated? I need to take some additional time to think it through more); however as soon as I put the book down my response was \\"Wow.\\"<br /><br />The ending wasn't what I anticipated either. Without giving away spoilers I will say that this book does not conclude this storyline at all and leads you into Book 2.all and leads you into Book 2.

B0049P1VHS|5.0|I do not normally care for zombie movies, but this one is truly a great story. I love the characters and the story line. You will not be disappointed in this one. I can't wait for season 2 to come out.
0439023513|2.0|Obviously to get to book three I liked the first two.  The series deals with starvation, cruelty and war so obviously it's going to be a bit dark but the first two books somewhat balance that with hope and humanity.  The third book however tilts way too far to the dark side.  With characters dying pointlessly left and right in increasing sadistic ways and the main character appearing to loose what was left of her humanity I found myself wondering why I should continue to read the book.  Simply put this is the darkest book I have ever read.  So many characters die. Some in ways so grotesque that it might make the creators of the movie Saw grimace.  My personal take is that Susan Collins decided to torture Katniss in the most horrible ways possible which made the book to sadistic to be entertaining.  This book kind of ruined the series for me.
B004QPOVE6|5.0|Truly awesome and powerful comeback nicely selected from a newly solid South American Rock Capital as Buenos Aires, not only full of locals, but also known to pull many many South Americans from different neighbor countries.  Also great selection of songs and BD quality and multiple camera angles.  A must for collectionists.  Enjoy !

B004X75RK4|5.0|I had seen reviews for this movie but somehow forgot to see it.  A friend recently recommended it when I mentioned I would like to spend a Friday night with popcorn and a chick-flick.  I rented it and watched it twice!  The nude scene was hilarious!  How many takes did they have to do to get that one right?  That scene was the best part of a very good movie!

B007PT3QOQ|1.0|I stopped playing the game before I went to bed and turned my kindle off. didn't turn it back on until the next evening and for some reason I did not earn any energy over a 6+ hour span of time. I'm pretty upset because I did put some money into this game. anyone else have this problem?

B004LWZW8S|3.0|but the souls of the righteous are immortal and divine. - Socrates<br /><br />King Hyperion (Mickey Rourke) megalomaniac only wants the world. After dispatching the mother of Theseus (Henry Cavill) he expects Theseus to join his cause. However the gods including Zeus (Luke Evans) expect Theseus to do his duty and save mankind without the help of the gods. It is not easy wondering who to put our emotions behind.<br /><br />This presentation is just a tad of distortion of mythical history.  A little too much CGI almost makes it a cartoon. There is lots of action and flying blood, one gratuitous birthday suite form the backside, scrawny titans and contemporary dialog. But most of all there is lots of loud music and noise.
B0071PS7AC|5.0|I read all of the other reviews and was skeptical about the game.  But I love it you can beat the computer and my scores are like the ones I actually do score when I get a chance to really go to the alley.
B0076D0D8S|5.0|I was surprised at how well all the elements came together for this film. Obviously the main cohesion is centered on Atticus Finch (Gregory Peck) and his relationship with his children, Scout (Mary Badham) and Jem (Philip Alford). I would classify this as one of Gregory peck's best movies. It almost had to be shot in black and whit to have the feel needed in the all but black and white movie.<br /><br />Scout and Jem know very little about their neighbor `Boo' (Robert Duvall.) They have heard and made up strange stories. They spend time daring each other and their summer friend, to go up to the neighbor house as it holds some mysterious crazed person. Through the movie many odd things happen such as a tree that mysteriously offers a series of objects from marbles to a watch, among other things. What do we really know about our neighbors?  Watch as the mystery unfolds. Moreover, what will they find out in this slice of life in the Depression-era South.<br /><br />[[ASIN:0060935464 To Kill a Mockingbird]]
1442419814|4.0|To be completely honest, the first time I picked up this book, I read one chapter and put it down. I don't know why, but the book didn't really flow for me, and I couldn't wrap my head around the aspect of what we consider pretty as being ugly in their world. But then. I found this book on my bookshelf a year after I had first tried to read it, and so I cracked it open and began to read. And this time I couldn't put it down.<br /><br />Once you get past the slighty slow-moving first part of the book, you are whirled into a world of insecurity and uglies. At the age of sixteen, every Ugly gets a surgery, becomes \\"Pretty\\", moves to Prettytown, and starts having the time of their lives. Tally Youngblood is as excited as anyone to become Pretty and to be able to see her already-Pretty friend Peris again. Yet, in the last couple months of her Ugly life, Tally meets Shay, a girl with the same birthday as her who has a different opinion about becoming Pretty. As Shay and Tally grow closer, Shay begins to show Tally things, things that will change her life forever. And when a week before their birthday, Shay runs away, Tally is faced with two options: find Shay and become Pretty, or stay Ugly forever. As expected, Tally chooses to hunt down Shay for the creepy \\"rulers\\" of her city, called Specials. But when Tally arrives at the Smoke, the place where many Uglies go for refuge from the Specials and becoming Pretty, she finds a world much different than she expects. And suddenly, Tally is faced with more conflicts and options than she has ever been before. But sometimes the obvious choice isn't the right one....<br /><br />I thoroughly enjoyed this book. I devoured it and immediately moved onto its sequel, Pretties, after that cliffhanger ending. But it wasn't just the plot I enjoyed, it was the world Tally lives in. I'm a huge fan of dystopian novels, and this one did not disappoint. I thought it was intruiging how, to stop war, which many believed was based off of jealousy and differences, everyone now looks the same. And to bring global warming to a halt, the city has obvious borders and uses eco-friendly materials overall. This should seem like a perfect world. But, as always with dystopian books, it's not. There's a part of the surgery that, Tally discovers, not only alters your body, but your brain. How come all the Pretties seemed, as with sterotypical pretty people, dumb and slightly vain? Tally has an answer, and it makes her, and consequently the reader, look at her world in a new light.<br /><br />Overall (22/25):<br />Plot: 4/5- The beginning was a little slow, but once you get past that, it's amazing!<br />Characters: 4/5- Shay's character was interesting and her development as a person was so well-crafted, yet frustrating at times.<br />Setting: 5/5- I loved Tally's world!<br />Romance: 4/5- Tally and David's romance seemed a little hurried, yet I really liked the twist at the end.<br />Teenage Factor (because I am one): 5/5- Any teenage girl would gobble this up!and differences, everyone now looks the same.

B005F82X48|5.0|Dude, I didn't even know who Icon For Hire was, and after I got this album I was like, \\"WHY HAVEN'T I HEARD OF THEM BEFORE?!?!?\\" I was jammin' from the first song to the last! Their in your face messages combined with their marriage of pop and rock leaves you wanting more! It sucks that Christian bands with female vocals automatically get compared to Fireflight and Flyleaf(great bands <333) and Paramore, because every band has a sound that is unique to them, and IFH  is no exception. The album carries a genuine and powerful message, which is that yes, you will have struggles in your life, and yes, their are problems in this world, and we can either cry about them and about why it's everyone's fault, or we can own the fact that sometimes we're part of the cause of these issues and do something to try to make a change, either in our own lives, or the lives of someone else. Not too shabby for a first album X) Hopefully the next will be just as fantabuluos, if not not better <33

B0011Z52EW|5.0|This is quite possibly one of the best albums ever written.  It is relatable (to everyone, in some way or another), beautiful, and memorable.  The lyrics are amazing, the music is wonderful, and Gerard's voice hasn't (and probably will never) let us down.

B0068RHSCW|3.0|Rather than give a synopsis of the plot, etc., I just want to give a few thoughts on this movie...<br /><br />I'm fresh from the theater. I just saw one of the weirdest movies I've ever seen - Dream House (2011), starring Daniel Craig, Naomi Watts, Rachel Weisz, and Marton Csokas. I didn't know much about this movie before going to see it. I thought this movie would be scarier than it was. It has a couple of jump-out-of-your-seat scenes, but that's about it. I found it a little confusing at first, but then I caught on to what was happening. No spoilers here - again, I won't reveal the plot. Read other reviews for that. I'll just say this - if you like movies that have a lot of twists and turns, then you might want to see this one.<br /><br />The acting is good for the most part, as is the musical score by John Debney. Rachel Weisz reminds me of Winona Ryder in a lot of ways. Naomi Watts turns in a solid performance.<br /><br />I don't know what to classify this movie as. I guess it's a thriller. I sort of recommend it, maybe as a rental.

B004NJC0B6|4.0|The concert film Let There Be Rock (1980) which features a live performance of ACDC, filmed in Paris in 1979, is especially significant because two months later, lead singer Ronald \\"Bon\\" Scott would be discovered dead in London, at the age of 33, effectively closing an era in the band's history.  This semi-documentary style production, captures the energy of ACDC live, and is apparently the last recorded performance of Bon Scott, whose virility on stage, and carefree personality off are both featured.<br /><br />Touring in support of [[ASIN:B00008BXJG Highway to Hell]] (1979), their most successful release up to that time, ACDC was just beginning to enjoy a taste of the kind of worldwide popularity they would later achieve.  Besides Scott, this performance features brothers Angus and Malcolm Young on guitar, Cliff Williams on bass, and Phil Rudd on drums.  The 13 song concert runs about 97 minutes, and has interview clips with various band members interspersed between some of the songs.  This type of presentation, which was more popular during the 1970's, gives the movie a dated feel, but doesn't distract too much from the enjoyment of the music, except for during \\"Walk All Over You\\", where an interview segment runs over a truncated version of the song.<br /><br />The setlist is very solid, and includes most of their best songs at the time.  A couple of notable exceptions would be \\"Touch Too Much\\" and \\"If You Want Blood\\", but there really isn't much reason to complain.  As always, Angus Young is a non-stop display of energy.  Playing guitar while gyrating the way he does, is actually much harder than it appears, and Angus really deserves a lot more recognition for being able to do what he does, for so long.  The rest of the band generally stays in the background rocking steady, unless needed to provide background vocals.<br /><br />This leaves most of the stage wide open for Bon Scott, and he takes full advantage prowling, prancing, and strutting, with the power and energy of a tiger.  Scott opens the show wearing a vest, and his posture and physique are reminiscent of a dark haired Robert Plant.  He is soon shirtless, wearing just jeans with a rip at the crotch, appearing to be in fantastic physical condition.  Scott is such a magnetic hunk of a man that it's hard to believe that he would soon meet an unfortunate fate.<br /><br />\\"Bad Boy Boogie\\" is one of the show's high points, with Angus taking the opportunity to strip off his schoolboy uniform, and tease the crowd with his lewd behavior.  One really good thing about ACDC live is that Angus does take the opportunity to stretch out and play much more than he does on the albums, as his bluesy roots become more evident.<br /><br />The performance is repeatedly broken up by interview segments, but rocks very strongly with \\"Highway To Hell\\", \\"Girl's Got Rhythm\\", and \\"High Voltage\\", before a final interview segment where Bon recounts how he went from being the band's chauffer, to joining the band.  In a passing comment that is quite eerie given the events to follow, Scott says \\"I drink too much\\".  The show concludes with \\"Whole Lotta Rosie\\" as Angus plays on despite an equipment mishap, \\"Rocker\\" with Angus wading into the crowd on Bon's shoulders, and then climbing on the top of the amps for his solo.  The encore is a raucous version of \\"Let There Be Rock\\".<br /><br />The video quality of the DVD release appears to be very true to the original material, and show very little signs of degradation.  The band's setup is very basic, and the lighting of the performance isn't the greatest, so although camera coverage is pretty good, and most of the views are unobstructed, unfortunately you don't get a lot of great looks at the band in decent lighting, until the later part of the show.  With Cliff and Malcolm, mostly hanging around Cliff's drum kit, which is set well back on the stage, you don't get to see that much of them.  The audio mix is very good, with nice balance, and you can almost always hear Scott's vocals clearly.<br /><br />Although it was never intended to be, Let There Be Rock stands as a testament to the talent of the late Bon Scott.  This high voltage release is highly recommended to fans of ACDC, and classic hard rock.most always hear Scott's vocals clearly.<br /><br />Although it was never intended to be, Let There Be Rock stands as a testament to the talent of the late Bon Scott.

B003K025TQ|5.0|Sorry, Mr. Ritenour.<br />I should have put this review in when I first made my purchase a year and a half ago but, I thought everybody knew about this disc, apparently not!! This is not your typical Jazz Cd by any stretch, as someone else in the review section suggested. This is a fabulous compilation of guitar magic. There is something here for everyone. This is good stuff, Traveling music? Oh yes indeed it is, kick back to some bluesy licks? Oh yes it is!! \\"Lay it Down\\", \\"68\\", and \\"In Your Dreams\\" are letting you know you are in for a treat Can you say instant classic? I can't even begin to tell you how special this one is. Every track is a gem to me and that's saying a lot. You'll have to buy this one and listen for yourself. I especially like this \\"Moon River\\" version, it takes me back to when Jimmy Smith was in his heydays, I just kept thinking GO MAN GO !! Whom ever this keyboardist is, thank you so much for the trip down memory lane. \\"Why I sing the Blues\\" is so very smooth, and with another master laying licks too. Mr. B.B.King, doing his thang as James Brown would say. The gang is all in on this disc. I'm now based out of Portland, Oregon where it seems everyone is a guitarist, but very few have heard of Mr. Ritenour, that is until I put them up on his musical background. Sometimes I can't get people out of my house, they are mesmerized by my knowledge of guitarists even though I don't play. I'm a vocalists who uses everything I have ever listened to, scale wise in my vocals. Mr. Ritenour is giving me a workout for real with this disc. Hope everyone enjoys it as much as I do.
B005HSG3VK|4.0|I have no real complaints except I should have paid a little more to get the cover by the same company that has a band to help hold the Kindle Fire in it's cover. This one does all it claims. I just I used the closing strap to help steady my hold, but that's not what it's designed for. I suggest you not be excited and in a hurry and put it on incorrectly because it is difficult to remove, it's a snug fit and that's a good thing, but it's HARD to correct an error.
0525478817|5.0|I really enjoyed this book. I am not usually a reader of YA's- I'm more a judge-a-book-by-its-cover reader, which is precisely what I did. I saw this on a stand in B&N and it called to me, for whatever reason, and then I saw the price. I waited a week before purchasing it here and I feel now that I wasted a week of my life by not having read this sooner.<br /><br />I began and finished this book in one day. Not because is was that easy but because it was that good. At first I found myself reading it to my boyfriend being all, \\"listen to this pretentious line\\" but the more I read the quieter I got until I locked myself in my bedroom to finish. I needed the quiet. I needed to finish. Hours later, when I emerged from my library, I read parts to my boyfriend but instead I said, \\"listen to this beautiful line\\".<br /><br />Truly a beautiful a read.

B004WCTLNY|3.0|This was an interesting concept, well-executed on the screen, and well-acted, as usual by Damon. Essentially, it is a good love story with speculative fiction mixed telling us that there is a magician behind the curtain in control of our lives similar in concept to The Truman Show, Matrix, etcetera.<br /><br />However, the ending of this one left me flat as it appeared woefully contrived.  It was too cutesy, too Hollywood. This was very very very loosely based on the Phillip Dick short story, written in the early fifties, titled, \\"The Adjustment Team.\\"  Essentially, this is an original script that took off from the Dick idea.  However, one wonders how Dick would have settled the ending if given the chance to write it.
0062082353|4.0|I have reviewed many books on Amazon and I've got to say this was the most difficult.  Yes, I read the entire book (although I must admit that I jumped around a little and came back to the pages unread).  What we have here is a young man who is fascinated and passionate about firearms (and he goes to great lengths talking about them).  Fortunately for you and me, Chris found a career that enabled him to make an honest living using firearms.  If it wasn't for proudly serving in the US Navy (which I am also a proud veteran), I'd hate to think of what he might have done.  American Sniper is a good read.  The input by his wife describing what it's like to live with an egomaniac (which you have to be to do what he does/did for a living) was a great touch to the book and certainly kept me reading it.  There is nothing new or revealing with regards to Navy Seal life.  Indeed there is an ample amount of killing (but that's the central theme of the book).  The story flows nicely (even though parts of it seem to get drawn out).  Now that I finished the book two days ago, I can't help but wonder that if later in Chris's life -- the psychological effects of his (justified) actions.  Like every other blue blooded American, I applaude his service and am deeply indebted to those like him because it truly takes unique individuals to keep our country free.  To those considering this book:  read it, try and understand the man who penned it but don't read to much into it because otherwise you could find yourself either enlisting in the armed forces or frustrated for even reading it.
B006X5L6VS|5.0|Great app for the Kindle Fire. Finally can identify all those beautiful constellations. Easy to download...easy to use..don't bother reading the manual.
B004GXA5U2|3.0|I saw the film first. It's better and it's worse, depending on what you want out of the story.<br />1) If you're a woman who wants to suffer every little thought and problem of the 'heroine', and then suffer all the constant feelings of guilt, and finally suffer with others while they suffer, then you definitely need to read the book. It's full of it.<br />The book goes into absorbing detail of all her guilt and suffering and will probably take you most of a week to read. It simply isn't one of those stories you can fly through, there is far too much detailed suffering.<br />2) If you're a relatively normal person the book will become excruciating. It goes on and on and on, mostly about how guilty she is to be working and not looking after her children full time and partly about how she is 'shown up' because her pies for the school bake are shop-bought and not home made. Ad nauseum.<br />The film is the best way to view this story; however even the film is mostly downright stupid. Why did I buy the book after seeing the movie? Because of an abiding implausible belief that the book is usually better than the screenplay.<br />Sorry, this time it's not.
B004EPYZXK|4.0|First off, All of the reviews I've read with people marking this down because it has \\"choppy/shakey filming\\" are complete idiots. Please complete college before posting a review. THAT WAS THE ENTIRE POINT OF THIS MOVIE, it was SUPPOSED TO BE \\"SHAKEY FILMING\\" as it was supposed to be \\"LOST FOOTAGE\\". It wasn't intended to be a Hollywood movie. It was supposed to look like it was just a collection of lost footage that was stolen from NASA. The bad filming was part of the story...<br /><br />The movie itself wasn't all that bad. It was a nice change for me. Although the aliens made of rocks was a little lame, I guess it was better than the normal grey aliens. Although, that may have made the move a little more creepy. It's a little expensive for this type of movie, I would rather get something like this from the $5 bin at Walmart.<br /><br />Its a good movie to rent from the library first, to see if you like it, before buying it. I ended up buying it after I rented it, but I enjoyed the movie.
B007P6NLSK|5.0|Kate Morton's superb 2010 thriller, \\"The Distant Hours\\", weaves a complex plot around family secrets in 1992 London and 1941 Milderhurt Castle in Kent, cleverly building to two dramatic and interlinked climaxes.  Morton deftly combines elements of historical fiction, gothic horror, and romance in a way that will keep readers tingling in suspense to the final pages.<br /><br />A preface introduces the chilling horror story of the Mud Man, written by Raymond Blythe of Milderhurst Castle.  The story proper gets underway with Edie Burchill, editor at a tiny London publishing house, and her mother Meredith, who receives a letter lost in the mail since 1941.  The letter opens up to Edie her mother's undisclosed past, including a wartime evacuation to Milderhurst and links to the author of Edie's favorite book, \\"The True History of the Mud Man.\\"  When a chance drive takes Edie to Kent, she is unable to resist the opportunity to visit the castle and meet the aging Blythe sisters, Percy, Saffy, and Juniper, daughters of Raymond and keepers of his and their own secrets.<br /><br />The story follows the three sisters during 1941, and Edie's sleuthing in the present of 1992.  At stake is the truth about the fate of a British soldier who disappeared on a stormy October night in 1941, forever altering the lives of the Blythe sisters and of Edie's mother Meredith.  The fate of the missing soldier may also be a clue to the origins of the Mud Man myth and the madness of its author.<br /><br />Kate Morton's prose is terrific, doling out the clues to her mysteries while creating rounded and complex characters living in two different eras, some as younger and older versions of themselves.  Morton uses all 500 pages of the novel to deliver an absorbing story with a suspenseful finish.  \\"The Distant Hours\\" is very highly recommended.
B004TJ1H3C|2.0|I liked most of the episodes from this season, but I have to down rate it for the horrible ending. I wont spoil the ending for those of you that haven't seen it, but it should have been done a lot better. This would have been a great ending had there been a 3rd season, but it's like the directors just got lazy at the end and decided not to finish the season, because it just ENDS.<br /><br />----- SPOLIER ------<br /><br />Ok, I will post it here, for those that have seen the movie before. I would really love to know what happened.. Did they find the lifesource? Did they make it home? Did Elie (if that's how you spell his name) kill himself after 2 weeks so that the ship had enough power to make it all the way to where it was going? Did the crew ever wake up or did the life pods malfunction like everything else on the ship? Did the military girl (can't remember her name) ever end up getting Lou Gehrig's Disease? What happened in the next galaxy????<br /><br />What a horrible way to end a show.

0345803485|5.0|So, as the reviews indicate, you are probably either going to love this one or hate this one.  There are things in this book that I was able to overlook simply because the emotional aspects of the story and characters really drew me in (so much so that I've read them 4 times since I bought the first one in November, but I digress...) and I was very wrapped up in Ana and Christian's story.  Was there repetition?  Sure; the \\"Inner Goddess\\" references got a little tiresome.  Were there strangely British phrases and terms spouting from the mouths of supposed Pacific-north-westerners? Quite a few.  Was Christian's status as a 27 year-old gazillionaire in a somewhat non-specific business which sounded like a cross between Richard Gere's job in \\"Pretty Woman\\" and Bill Gates a bit hard to swallow?  You'd better believe it.  Yet I was enthralled by these books.  I loved Ana's voice.<br /><br />  For those of you who dislike a first person narrative this will be a tough read for you because not only is it first person, but it is first person present-tense.  I think that was used effectively here as it heightened the sense of urgency as well as the dramatic \\"what-next\\" tension of the narrative. I also loved that Ana was an inexperienced young woman with a lot of doubts but also a very clear sense of what she wants and what she will accept.  The push-pull between her desire for Christian's love and her wide-eyed \\"holy crap\\" experiences with how he conducts his love-life were really well done.  I think the exploration of sex and BDSM from the her viewpoint was really nicely managed.<br /><br />  Christian is, to me, one of the best male leads in romance that I've read in a long time.  I have all sorts of love for tortured-past heroes and he sure fills that bill.  I also love stories about men who like to be in control and need to be in control and demand to be in control and then get that rug pulled right out from under them by a guileless woman.  These books do a really nice job of showing his evolution from an emotionally damaged man to someone willing to risk a lot for love.  I'm a sucker for that.<br /><br />  The BDSM aspects of this book might shock some readers. I for one thought they were pretty tame and barely crossed into anything other than light bondage and minor discipline.  I find it funny that some reviewers complain that the sex is too wild and too perverted while others complain that it doesn't go far enough.  I try to remember that sex and sexual fantasies are deeply personal to each person and what one person finds strange another finds too mundane.  I don't think these books really go into the actual \\"real\\" BDSM lifestyle at all; they hint around it with the contract and the Red Room of Pain, but these are not the ultimate focus of the relationship.  It doesn't read to me as a condemnation of the lifestyle because Christian's entire self-view is really effed up, so on the one hand you have his own self-loathing assessment of why he prefers what he deems to be sadism and on the other hand you have Ana's inexperienced viewpoint that shows her understandable hesitations and questions about what all this means to her and just how far she can allow it to go.  I think this is one of the books strong points as it explores the negotiations that should go on in any relationship dealing with BDSM.  The fact that what Ana is willing to do versus what Christian is wanting to do are two different things... well, I think that's true to an extent in all bedroom negotiations.<br /><br />  The true strength of these books is the emotional pull they exert.  I really think that for a book to be well-written it not only has to be composed of well-structured prose, but also has to have a great story and a great emotional interface with the reader.  Of course not all books resonate the same with all readers.  It doesn't make the book bad, it makes the book not that reader's cup of tea.  Well, this book hit all the emotional and story-tellingmarks for me.  I wish a really good editor had gotten their hands on it before it made the leap from fan-fiction to \\"print\\", but on the other hand I was able to love it to pieces just as it is, so I'm quite content with it.  My concern with the editing has more to do with the public perception of romance novels as a \\"trashy\\" genre in the first place.  This is not at all the case.  There are tons and tons of well-written romance novels out there and the fact that this book is now spearheading public perception of the genre is in some ways great and in some ways a little frustrating.  Great because romance novels do often have the all-consuming emotional pull and impact that this book does, but frustrating because it really bothers me to read \\"well this is just a romance novel, you can't expect it to be well-written\\" in reviews and comments all over the internet!<br /><br />  For those of you who think this is a great book and you would like to read more like it, I would direct you to several great romance blogs smartbitchestrashybooks; smexybooks; allaboutromance; dearauthor (to name a few off the top of my head).  They publish great reviews and can help direct you to your next romance novel/erotica book of choice.  Some reviewers have recommended \\"The Story of O\\" or the Sleeping Beauty books (by A.N. Roquelaure) and if your interest in Fifty Shades of Grey was the sexual/erotic/BDSM aspect of it then go ahead and try those, but I would caution that those are not romances and do not have similar emotional arcs at all to these books.  If you want romances with a little more edge to them then you might be better off with books by Cherise Sinclair or Maya Banks.<br /><br />  For those of you who didn't like this book or hated this book for whatever reason, please have a little respect for those of us who love it.  We are not morons.  We are not simply supporting it because we read Twilight and couldn't live with ourselves till we saw Edward and Bella doing the dirty.We are not sex-starved housewives.  We are not people with no discriminating taste when it comes to literature.  For whatever reason these books worked for us and reading them was a joyful experience.  I feel bad that they didn't work for you as well, but I'm not silly enough to think that just because I love something everyone else must also love it as well!  Peace to all and happy reading!

B00008WT5J|4.0|In the summer of 1986, the horror film \\"Maximum Overdrive\\", directed by horror master Stephen King was released and it was a real dud.  Nowadays, Mr. King admits that the movie was terrible.  The cool thing though was he used AC/DC for the soundtrack to the film. There are nine tracks in all and fans will recognize such monster hits as \\"You Shook Me All Night Long\\", \\"Hells Bells\\", \\"For Those About to Rock (We Salute You), and \\"Who Made Who\\" (which was one of the theme songs to the summer of '86 for me).  There are a couple of cool instruments and other rocking songs that round out the collection.  There is not a bad track on the whole album which is definitely worth checking out.

B005D4Y522|5.0|I'll come right out and say straight away that I'm no expert on the symphonies of the great man, because nowadays I spend far more of my musical hours listening to renaissance and baroque music than to this new-fangled 19th-century stuff. But, as a young chap a few years back, I was brought up on Beethoven, mainly through recordings from such as Furtw&auml;ngler, Klemperer, Karajan, and later also Carlos Kleiber and Harnoncourt for some of the individual symphonies. So I can't lay claim to the kind of knowledge about the vast range of available recordings enjoyed by some other reviewers, and least of all to any ability to draw comparisons with other recent sets; I simply judge this recording on its merits as I hear them.<br /><br />That said, I think Thielemann's set is absolutely terrific. I like the conductor's approach to Beethoven, he has plenty to say about the music, and his individual touches and eccentricities  - portamenti, rallentandi, dynamic variations and the like - always feel as if they arise naturally from the music itself, rather than being imposed upon it. Gentle, subtle and lyrical where appropriate, he and his players are just as good at conveying the furious energy of the great revolutionary, and there's certainly no way you would get bored listening to this set. The Wiener Philharmoniker are a wonderful orchestra and the sound they make is quite splendid, as is the recording quality. The ambience of these live recordings adds feeling and atmosphere to the proceedings, with ambient noise noticeable before and between movements - musicians shifting and preparing, instruments being positioned, a few chairs creaking, the evident presence of an extremely well-behaved Vienna audience - but with no disturbance or noticeable disadvantages whatever.<br /><br />Taking the works one by one, I've been especially pleased with those symphonies which I have tended to hear less frequently over the years. The fleetness and agility of the quick movements of numbers 1 and 2 are beautifully captured, with a terrific coda to the last movement of the Second. Again, I particularly enjoyed the Fourth; I never paid it a great deal of attention before, but love its sunlit landscape in this performance. Moving on to (for me) more familiar territory, the Eroica is superb here - the first movement especially fine, with orchestral playing and sound quality both splendid, and a thrilling coda. In the Marcia funebre, the fugato passage at around 8 minutes is quite wonderful. The Fifth symphony is brilliant too, with many fine moments such as the first horn call in the opening movement, the brass wonderful in stating the main subject of the third movement, and likewise the lower strings in the Trio. Altogether this is a fabulous Fifth, one of monumental impetus and excitement.<br /><br />In the Pastoral, I especially appreciated the lovely instrumental work from the woodwinds. The third movement is splendid, with a terrific peasants' dance, an exciting storm and a lovely transition as it subsides. Overall, I think this is a decent but perhaps unexceptional Sixth, with enough high points and eccentricities to hold the attention. The Seventh is superb; highlights for me are the coda of the first movement, and everything about the Allegretto - wonderful right from the start with full, rich chords from the lower strings and marvellous impetus throughout. The third movement is superbly athletic, with splendid flow and nothing to impede its light-footed energy. The Eighth I found a bit disappointing, somewhat lacking in brio and overall just about OK; but then it's not really one of my favourites.<br /><br />The Ninth is a great success - inspiring, deeply considered, never at any point routine or pedestrian. The first movement is as exciting as can be, and altogether magnificent. The Adagio is terrific, especially as it nears the end. In the final movement, I love the wonderfully rhetorical opening statements from this orchestra, just as goodas any I've ever heard. The soloists are respectable, and the choir of the Wiener Singverein are simply superb, especially from \\"Seid umschlungen\\". The Allegro passage from around 18 minutes goes with a tremendous swing, with great joyous calls of \\"Freude\\" towards the close. This is an all-embracing and deeply satisfying Ninth.<br /><br />The accompanying \\"making of\\" DVD is a great asset to this set. It's a 44-minute documentary with interviews (with a choice of German or English voice-over), rehearsals and concert excerpts - the switches between the latter two especially entertaining when, for example, we see Thielemann rehearsing his orchestra in a rugby shirt, then cut to the same passage with him conducting the concert in the regulation penguin outfit, and back again. Thielemann has plenty of interest to say in the interview sections, for example about his kind of synthesis between Romantic and HIP approaches with, of course, his own ideas added to the mix; and about the reasons for his scepticism over Ludwig's metronome markings.<br /><br />Best of all in this DVD, I thought, were the rehearsal scenes - especially impressive for me are the conductor's terrific rapport with the orchestra and his attention to the minutest details. We see the players react as one to a Thielemann look, a raised eyebrow, a change of expression or a slight movement of the hand or finger; and you get the feeling that they can, and will, do just about anything for him. Has this obvious mastery of his orchestra been achieved, as with certain notorious tyrants of musical history, by ruthless means of intimidation, humiliation and deprivation which, of course, we're not allowed to see? Or is it a result of the genuine admiration, commitment and devotion of his musicians? Well, he seems like a nice enough bloke, and the players who are interviewed have only good things to say about their conductor; so, unless the video producers have perpetrated an outrageously cunning deception upon us,I'm guessing it's very much the latter rather than the former explanation. But altogether it's gripping and impressive stuff, especially revealing in demonstrating the calm, reflective sincerity of Thielemann's approach to his own task and to the master's music.<br /><br />In addition to the fascinating insights of the DVD, then, the distinctive assets of this Beethoven set for me are the quality and ambience of the live recordings, the superb sound and playing of the Wiener Philharmoniker, the compact and attractive presentation of the CDs, and above all Christian Thielemann's wholly convincing vision of the master's symphonies.

1442419814|4.0|I love the cover of this one. I can't really pinpoint why this is, but it just always catches my attention. I also like the tagline of, \\"In a world of extreme beauty, anyone normal is ugly.\\"<br /><br />Uglies started out a little slow for me, but once I got into it, I really enjoyed the story. It really made me think about what it would be like if everyone in the world turned \\"pretty\\" at the age of 16. In one way, it would be nice in the sense that potentially no one would be judged by their looks, but on the other hand, it takes away any individuality. It really is a difficult situation to imagine.<br /><br />The world Westerfeld created seems pretty fun to live in, if you take away all of the creepy Special Circumstances people. The idea of hoverboards and bracelets to make sure you never plummet to your death was such a cool idea. I would need those bracelets for sure. I am not the most graceful person on the planet. I also have been loving dystopian novels lately.<br /><br />I think this one could potentially be a good book to be read in a high school class. It teaches a lesson without being overly preachy and it is pretty \\"clean\\" for a teen book.

1416972242|4.0|I think the cover is gorgeous. I always seem to like Cassandra Clare's book covers with their cityscapes and one character focus. I'm not a huge fan of the Stephenie Meyer quote being directly in the center, but to each their own. I love how the protagonist is a red-head. Yay for the red-head love. I'm so happy all of these books seem to match each other, so when I do buy them, they will look excellent next to one another on my shelf. They will also look nice with the Infernal Devices books. Score.<br /><br />I just want to start out with a couple things I tweeted while reading...<br />\\"Page 271 out of 453 in 'city of ashes' by @cassieclare. i want to punch valentine in the face.\\"<br />\\"he's such a jerk face\\"<br />\\"Wahhh i just want to find out how city of ashes ends!\\".<br /><br />I'm pretty sure that Cassie makes me an impatient reader. It always seems as if I cannot read fast enough because I just want to know how this is going to end! Clearly, it will be awhile before I find out with one more book already printed in the series and three more after that which are currently unprinted. Luckily, the journey to find out what on Earth is happening in these books is quite excellent as well.<br /><br />I really like Clare's writing style. She gives her characters some snark, which I always appreciate. She always makes me curious as to what is really happening. It makes me so frustrated when the characters think one thing, but in actuality, I think that something else is going on. It makes for a frustrating, but excellent read. I cannot wait to find out what the real deal is with Jace, Clary and Valentine.<br /><br />I may have preferred City of Bones a bit more, but that could change from day to day. I am really looking forward to the next installment
B002LW9ITY|5.0|Bought this for my son and he totally love this set. The toys are collectible and well-made. I wish the box is more durable or at least in better casing.
1416955070|4.0|I love all of the covers for Cassandra Clare's books. I like how you can't really see their faces, but you still know exactly what character they are supposed to be. Add in the cityscape and I'm sold.<br /><br />A little background from me.... I read an ARC of Clockwork Angel (review) before I started the Mortal Instruments series. I'm not quite sure why I never read them (obviously I was delusional). I always picked them up in the bookstore and then put them down. I still don't get it. I clearly love the covers. The synopsis' are awesome. Just a major fail on my part, I suppose. Anyway, I adored Clockwork Angel more than anything so I had to snatch up City of Bones as soon as I could.<br /><br />Clare has the talent of making you trust a person completely and then turning the whole story around on you. It is amazing. She draws me in and then plucks at my heartstrings. It is a testament to how delightful this book is that I was on vacation in Boston and all I wanted to do was get back to the room so I could read. Jace is the quintessential bad boy with a past--how could you not love him? One of my favorite things about Clare's writing is she draws me in with the characters and then the plot. Obviously the story is fantastic, but it would be nothing without the strong characters to support it.<br /><br />If you have been living under a rock, like I apparently have, go read these books...now.
B007Q2N0HA|5.0|First off, I haven't written a review in a while.  After reading BARED TO YOU by SYLVIA DAY I felt the need to.<br /><br />If you're looking for a book similar To Fifty Shades of Grey by E.L. James then BARED TO YOU is THE BOOK!  Some may think it's a rip of Fifty, but in my case I appreciate it for what it is...  Two emotionally F'd up individuals hoping to find some kind of happiness.  In my opinion I think it's better than Fifty Shades and it may have to do with Sylvia Day being a seasoned author.  You can be the judge of that.<br /><br />From the moment Eva and Gideon meet, there's a connection they can't resist.  Initially it's a physical attraction that creates interest.  They try to keep it casual, however one broken individual can recognize another and that's what Eva recognizes in Gideon.  Although he tries to deny and in the process hurts Eva he always finds himself chasing after her because she sees him.  Accepting the knowledge brings them closer, but not wiser regarding their relationship.  They understand they'll need to take baby steps if they want their relationship to work.  You do see them grow and learn from their mistakes.<br /><br />How can two dysfunctional individuals make a relationship work?  Their relationship is emotional, intense and complicated.  They're obsessed, possessive and jealous of each other.  Put all that together and the sex is explosive, their love is sweetly intoxicating, their relationship at times is stormy but when they're happy it's beautiful.<br /><br />Will Eva have enough patience to overcome her frustrations with Gideon withholding his past from her?  I hope so.  Like Gideon, Eva and Cary (Eva's best friend), I myself is a part of the F'd up group so I can relate to their story.  They all deserve their happily ever after as I have.  ^_^<br /><br />I can't wait for the next book, DEEPER IN YOU, to learn more about Gideon.  My only hope is that it's not like Fifty Shades Darker.  I love Fifty Shades of Grey, but in the second book, I felt as if I read the first book all over again.  I have yet to read the third book.<br /><br />Updated 4/30/2012second book, I felt as if I read the first book all over again.  I have yet to read the third book.<br /><br />Updated 4/30/2012
0375842209|5.0|This is my very favorite book. It is amazing in every way; it is amazingly written and amazingly creative. It has been my favorite book for six years. I have read it several times, but never finished it; I always stopped 1/2 way or 3/4 through it. Then a few months later I would pick it up and start over. I never wanted to finish it because I never wanted to know how it ended and I to say good bye to the characters. The first time was difficult because I began reading it right after my cancer surgery and I didn't know how much longer my story would last. And, it is narrated by Death, a very objective observer of the main character's life. It may seem morbid at first, but I learned that Death has nothing personal against me through this book. Thank you Markus Zusak for writing such an amazing story and such an amazing piece of literature.

B003EYVXV4|2.0|Although its mish-mash of various genres ultimately makes it unqualifiable, I suppose you could say The Hunger Games is primarily a slasher film for young teens, with the scary beings who jump out at you with blades being those terrifying older teens.  You have to be a grown-up to know how offensive it is in using child soldiers and portraying dogs as weapons.<br /><br />It could also, however, be seen despite itself as an allegory for young people being forced by their societies to compete desperately for places in universities, for jobs, for housing, etc. -- in a world where there's never enough to go around.  If the film had given me any sense that it was aware of its potential in this dimension, I could give it more than two stars.<br /><br />Otherwise, it's a film for young teens.  My favorite part (I saw it in a theater) was the vocal audience participation when the girl kisses the guy.  This was a Big Deal for our audience.
B0073XORCY|5.0|This album is a mediation on finding oneself suddenly past middle age in a world dominated by suburbia, Starbucks, and Ebay (not to mention Amazon.com).  Thematically it explores the various possible lives of Ian Anderson's fictional alter-ego, the boy-poet Gerald Bostock, in the years since 1972. From getting groped by a schoolmaster to becoming a cutthroat banker, Bostock's various life-paths suggest that this album is as much Anderson's take on contemporary popular culture as it is a look back at the 40 years since Bostock's (and Jethro Tull's) precocious early efforts in \\"Thick as a Brick.\\"<br /><br />As opposed to its 1972 precursor, TAAB2 is less a single musical sequence than a mosaic of interwoven motifs and fragments; in construction it thus resembles as much Brian Wilson's \\"Smile\\" as any long-play progressive-rock opus.  This is neither good nor bad; it's simply the way this album is built.  The 17 tracks include brief spoken-word sections, a duet (a first for Anderson, I think), and even a brief donation-pitch from a Southern televangelist: Ian Anderson putting on his best American accent.  Some of the album's strongest tunes are very brief, almost maddeningly so; this has long been a tradition with Anderson's songwriting. \\"Upper Sixth Loan Shark,\\" \\"Power and Spirit\\" and \\"Give Till It Hurts\\" are as brief as any of the short songs from the \\"Aqualung\\" album, and the latter two are easily as critical of the Anglican Church.  Throughout, the album's numerous vocal effects add a welcome dynamism to Anderson's aging voice.  Far from considering this voice a liability -- as is the case for so many die-hard fans who first saw Jethro Tull in concert in the 70s-- the songs on this album warrant the grizzled, often heavily distorted tone of an older man's voice.  And on the quieter songs, the breathlessness of his higher registers rings out with painful sweetness.<br /><br />The album's most important and most melodically accomplished songs are two of the songs thatJethro Tull and Anderson had been playing in concert over the past several years: \\"A Change of Horses\\" and \\"Adrift and Dumbfounded.\\"  A third, the magnificent \\"Kismet in Suburbia,\\" is a welcome surprise, and is my current favorite on the entire album-- in my opinion one of Anderson's strongest compositions.<br /><br />With regard to some of the angry criticism from certain longstanding Tull fans: indeed, this is not a Jethro Tull album.  TAAB2 is, in spite of its multiple, karmic incarnations of Gerald Bostock, a defiantly solo effort.  Indeed, it is so much a solo record that it seeks to reclaim the 1972 \\"Thick as a Brick\\" as something of a solo effort as well. Here I part ways with some of the publicity for the album, which downplays the contribution of Anderson's band-mates in the past, particularly Jethro Tull's longtime guitarist Martin Barre.  Yes, Anderson writes all of the songs for Jethro Tull; but the songs themselves have always been group efforts in the end, always bearing the contributions of the band members.  To this end, TAAB2 likewise bears the signature of Ian's current solo band; there's less counterpoint than in the original \\"Thick as a Brick\\" album, and fewer extended instrumental passages. But the solo band is a good one, breaking in some interesting new sounds and tones that may or may not find their way back into Jethro Tull music in the future (two of the musicians, the pianist John O'Hara and the bassist David Goodier, are in both bands).<br /><br />In short, I find this is a fascinating, listenable, and at times deeply moving album.  It's an album with a history-- this is, after all, its very premise-- and yet it also rings true as a piece of contemporary music attentive to the poignancy of how quickly we can cease to be contemporary, becoming out of step with the contemporary life that surrounds us.
B0018RWD5O|4.0|Recorded in mid-1964, CRESCENT is one of John Coltrane's efforts with his great quartet: McCoy Tyner (piano), Jimmy Garrison (bass) and Elvin Jones (drums). Compositionally, the album is fairly traditional, offering few hints of the free jazz that the great saxophonist was to embark on the following year. \\"Crescent\\", \\"The Wise One\\" and \\"Lonnie's Lament\\" are ballads. Coltrane's solo in the title track veers far off the melody, but for most of the album there's an introspective/sleepy/noctural atmosphere.<br /><br />For me, this is one of the least memorable albums in my Coltrane collection, although as the music is playing it is quite entertaining. Among the early 1960s quartet albums, CRESCENT stands out for a nearly track-long Elvin Jones solo (\\"The Drum Thing\\"). Garrison gets a long solo on \\"Lonnie's Lament\\" too, while Coltrane chooses not to solo at all in the second half of the album. Thus Coltrane sounds like he's holding back, before his anguished spiritual explorations in saxophone form would grab the spotlight in A LOVE SUPREME and later albums.

B007PT3QOQ|5.0|I have had a blast interacting more than in the classic version. Definitely better than other tap games. I love the Oregon Trail story that follows.
0807014273|5.0|This is an amazing book!  It should be required reading for all high school students.  It is a deeply moving account of one man's survival, physically and emotionally, of an incredibly horrendous experience.  It has given me a guiding light during difficult times in my own life.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|this game is like the games off facebook. it is really fun and addicting. u should get it because its a great free game.
B005K17RU0|5.0|Easy to read especially for those of us with older eyes. Clear and concise. The forecast has been very accurate.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|It is. Good but it has a lot of guy games in it it is challenging. And keeps me interested.
0345803485|5.0|Love this book. Love this series. Bought it on a whim one night because I was bored and needed something to help me fall asleep. Needless to say, eight hours later when my husband was waking up to go to work, I finally made myself put the book down and go to bed. I could read the series over and over. Every time a friend tells me where they are in the book, I start reading at that spot again.
B000JQUGVI|1.0|really didn't get into it at all. really tried, but just got to 30% read, and quit.  have so many other books to read and didn't want to waste any more time on this one.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|can't. stop - so fun - need more wood - send help - townsmen depend on you. use resources. wisely don't let too many die - make medicine continually
B003L77G6A|5.0|I have season's 1-4 on dvd and I love them all!  I just love this show.  Amy is in a good bit of the 4th seasons episodes which is cool cause Amy is awesome!
B007P3TMW2|4.0|This movie was very interesting. It was also very sad.  I cried several times at the horror of what this family (and all the others) went through.  But it was an intriguing tale of a young boy trying to reconcile the death of his father, his own grief and knowledge of the events, and his new relationship with his mother.  The boy is smart and unique and the parents are also very creative and caring.  The tale is quite beautiful and ends on a high note.  It was a little slow moving, but I thoroughly enjoyed it.  I would suggest this to others as well.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|i  just got this book  and now i'm getting mad  you guys are telling me this  book  sucks …!?!?! =.=*ugh really not cool  ……… so wait  is it a love story or about a annoying girl i still hate both ;'( so plz tell me guys idk  what going  on???

B007PTJOV0|5.0|this side scroll has to be the best ive played on the fire so far. I hope NER Brothers make more games like this one.
B005LAII0I|4.0|\\"Once upon a time, in a kingdom far, far away....\\" How many times will they remake \\"Snow White\\" and when will we tire of seeing it? At least this time it's billed as \\"The untold adventures...\\" and is from the queen's point of view.<br /><br />In this version, our evil queen is played by a wry, dry Julia Roberts, who is clearly having the time of her life, so let's get ready for a new wrinkle on an old story. Her acerbic digressions are a hoot as this is a far more adult (and more comic) take.<br /><br />This cast promises more than a light touch of comedy:<br />  * Julia Roberts (\\"Larry Crowne\\") is a four-times-married widow who instantly sees potential in the handsome prince who comes adventuring into her poverty-stricken realm. In order to throw a party for him, she raises taxes.<br />  * Lily Collins (\\"Priest\\") is our orphaned Snow White, slated for an early death in the forest as soon as the queen realizes the threat from her burgeoning beauty. Collins has the eyebrows of a young Elizabeth Taylor.<br />  * Armie Hammer (\\"J. Edgar\\") is very funny as the dauntless prince. He is earnest, sincere and quite handsome. He keeps losing all but his skivvies to the dwarfs and has to beg for pants. Wait until you see his tooth sparkle just before he is given the love potion.<br />  * Nathan Lane (\\"Modern Family\\") is the queen's minion. He is the unwilling bearer of all the bad tidings, e.g., when taxes are raised, and when Snow White is found to be alive after all.<br />  * Sean Bean (\\"Game of Thrones\\") as the king, long thought dead.<br />  * Mare Winningham (LOTS of TV) as the scullery maid who is loyal to Snow White and her long-absent father.<br /><br />Snow White doesn't have good or bad things just happen to her. She has to toil, study, practice and fight, for what she values. I liked seeing her apply herself with a goal in mind; so even though small children were a bit bored, the lessons for their older siblings were good ones. The adult one-liners that made all ofus laugh went over the tots' heads, but the lengthy CGI-loaded fight scenes (with G-rated monsters) were tedious for ALL of us. I can fast-forward through those when I get my DVD from Amazon.com.
B007KQ6XYY|5.0|I loved playing Cut the Rope on my kindle and was sad when I'd mastered all the levels. A friend had been playing Experiments on their iPhone of months, but it still wasn't available for the Kindle. As soon as I saw it, I bought it. Really cute, different challenges than CtR, which is great. Had it for about 2 weeks, no problems except I'm almost finished with the third stage! Hope more levels come out soon. Great game, easy to pick up, hard to put down. Definitely worth a dollar!
B005S9EJ14|5.0|\\"Your call is very important to us. Please remain on the line...\\"<br /><br />We started with a smile which rarely faded in this lovely PG-13 comedy. Here are gathered the best old war horses of British cinema. What a treat! And as a bonus, a trip through the color and chaos of modern-day India as seen through the eyes of seven senior citizens caught up in major culture shock. Each of our principal players is going to India for his or her own reason: to find a lost love; to look for a rich maharajah, to find a cheap place to live, to rejuvenate a marriage, to get a new hip; the reasons are as diverse as the people.<br /><br />We have:<br />  * Judi Dench (\\"As Time Goes By\\") Told to imagine her audience naked to overcome her stage fright: I think I'm a bit past all that...\\"<br />  * Bill Nighy (\\"Blow Dry\\") After failing to fix a leaky water tap: \\"Now that I've got the hang of it, do you have anything else I can NOT fix?\\"<br />  * Maggie Smith (\\"Downton Abbey\\") In response to the National Health Care's six-month wait for a new hip: \\"Six months! At my age, I don't plan anything that far ahead. I don't even buy green bananas!\\"<br />  * Tom Wilkinson (\\"The Debt\\") Answering the question, \\"What do you see out there?\\" he beams, \\"Smiles!\\"<br />  * Penelope Wilton (\\"Match Point\\") Sitting in the stifling, self-imposed exile of her room, \\"How can you STAND it out there?\\"<br />  * Ronald Pickup (lots of TV) When asked the advisability of sex for senior citizens, \\"Well, if she dies, she dies!\\" He is an aging wanna-be gigolo who can get an astonishing amount of \\"action\\" from two aspirin!<br />  * Celia Imrie (\\"Cranford\\") thinks she's got enough \\"it\\" for at least one more go at landing a wealthy husband.<br />  * Dev Patel (\\"Slumdog Millionaire\\") Trying to recapture his deceased father's dream: \\"Everything will be all right in the end. If it's not all right, it's not the end.\\"<br />  * Tena Desae (\\"Yeh Faasley\\") joins the pantheon of gorgeous stars formed in the Bollywood galaxy. Welove her as she trains at a call center and copes with disapproval.<br /><br />Each character is in one crisis or another but no ends are left dangling. This is a satisfying and entertaining look at a country most of us will never visit but which intrigues us, nonetheless. We see remnants of the old caste system, while we recognize remnants of a new one which flit by, unnoticed; AND we appreciate the skill with which each old pro commands his or her moment in the spotlight. I can hardly wait until this is available on DVD from Amazon.com!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|1 word to describe this application is awesome! I can't wait to unlock all these game in this application. Love it!!!!!!
B003Y5H5B0|3.0|Now THIS is for a targeted audience! I had to admire how cannily screenwriters Jonah Hill and Michael Bacall tailored their script with the right language (profane), situations (interfering parents), and embarrassments left over from adolescence (prom dates and bad grades) for the 17/30-year-old ticket buyer. No wonder it has made so much money. Smart guys!<br /><br />We have two buddies, totally different, both of whom make it through the Police Academy, only to botch their first big arrest. Consequently, they are assigned to an angry sergeant who is stuck in a Korean Church (at 21 Jump Street) and sent undercover to a local high school to find the distributor of a lethal drug that is making its way into the teenage culture. Unfortunately, this means they have to live at home again.<br /><br />Part of the joke is that former jock Tatum is mistakenly assigned to the brainy classes, while poor pudgy Hill is sent to the track team. Another joke is several setups for blowie uppie stuff that simply do NOT explode. Our heroes are confused because they were counting on explosions. Of course the party when the parents leave town is predictably lewd and destructive. Even Mom's Kokopelli jug from Sedona bit the dust!<br /><br />These guys gave it their all:<br />  * Channing Tatum (\\"The Vow\\"), demonstrating hitherto unknown comedy chops. Who knew? (He's the jock.)<br />  * Jonah Hill (\\"Moneyball\\"), more slender now than he has ever been, his character has a real problem shooting a gun. (He's NOT the jock.)<br />  * Ice Cube (\\"Rampart\\"), is the astonishingly profane (and furious) sergeant.<br />  * Dave Franco (\\"Fright Night\\"), is a politically correct environmentalist who is scared to death of going to prison. (\\"Do you know how they treat handsome guys like me in there?!\\")<br /><br />Even thought this wasn't my cup of tea, I tip my hat to the folks that targeted their audience and scored a bullseye! Amazon.com will tell me when it's available on DVD.

B002QE3CTY|5.0|The Maze Runner by James Dashner<br />(This review originally published at Brazen Broads Book Bash)<br /><br />When Thomas wakes up in the lift, the only thing he can remember is his first name. His memory is blank. But he's not alone. When the lift's doors open, Thomas finds himself surrounded by kids who welcome him to the Glade--a large, open expanse surrounded by stone walls.<br />Just like Thomas, the Gladers don't know why or how they got to the Glade. All they know is that every morning the stone doors to the maze that surrounds them have opened. Every night they've closed tight.  No one wants to be outside of the Glade at night.  And every 30 days a new boy has been delivered in the lift.<br />Thomas was expected. But the next day, a girl is sent up--the first girl to ever arrive in the Glade. And more surprising yet is the message she delivers.<br />Thomas might be more important than he could ever guess. If only he could unlock the dark secrets buried within his mind.<br /><br /> I loved this book.  The Maze Runner is a mash of action, sci-fi, suspense and overall great writing, which constitutes as a pretty good book to me.  I'd suggest this book to anyone around thirteen or older.  Yes-- even you old folks would enjoy it.  It relates a bit to the Hunger Games, so if you liked those, you will love this.  I found the beginning a little hard to get into, but after that, the only thing I had trouble with was putting it down.  Believe me, you don't want to miss out on this book; it left my nerves jumping at every turn, and even crying at one point.  Now don't let that scare you away, it was only one part.  But the suspense is thrilling, and once you're in the book, it's impossible to get out.<br /><br />This is the first book, but be on the lookout for my review of the second novel : The Scorch Trials<br />~Willow Naveen '<br /><br />Overall Rating:  5 Stars'''''
B005T87QCI|1.0|This game is bad. There is no Atom or Zeus.  The controls are bad. The computer can do moves you can't do.  All you can do is punch andndo uppercutsnand and move.  Don't waste your money on this.  There are free games better than this
B003F3FJQO|5.0|The Scorch Trials by James Dashner<br /><br />The Scorch Trials picks up where The Maze Runner left off. The Gladers have escaped the Maze, but now they face an even more treacherous challenge on the open roads of a devastated planet.  They are told the minimal, and face the worst.<br />And WICKED has made sure to adjust the variables and stack the odds against them.<br />Can Thomas survive in such a violent world?<br /><br />The Second book in the Maze Runner series left me furious.  Not at the book or the author, but at the characters.  You know, the 'bad guys'.  Just when they thought the whole ordeal was done, it wasn't.  Now you as a reader know that-- he wouldn't write a book about nothing at all.  This surprisingly realistic situation leaves your brain thinking, and wanting more.  I honestly don't think I ever set the book down.  The Scorch Trials is book full of suspense, twists, and emotion.  I swear that if you liked the first book in the novel, then you will love this one.  James Dashner did a phenomenal job of writing this book-- it is well written and able to bring out emotions, making you laugh at appropriate times or feeling angry.  He was well organized and kept me craving the next page, chapter, book.  I promise You won't lose interest, it is well worth the read!<br /><br />Watch out for my next review on the Final book in The Maze Runner trilogy: The Death Cure<br /><br />~ Willow Naveen ¢¾<br />(This review originally posted at Brazen Broads Book Bash)<br />Overall Rating: ¢&Agrave;¢&Agrave;¢&Agrave;¢&Agrave;¢&Agrave;
B00004R99F|5.0|Ordered it for my 22 year old at college. One of her fondest memories as a kid. Gave it to her for Easter. She loved it.
B004O3YGMC|5.0|Does exactly what it's meant to do. I love it. I am able to connect to my laptop and computer using my phone in case I forgot a file on my desktop in a matter of seconds.
B006OAB3ME|2.0|Seriously, don't listen to this and operate heavy machinery. It barely sounds like Paul, he sings in a low near-whisper, and sounds like he has a sinus infection. I'm a big fan, but this just ain't workin' for me. I know he can sing better than this, they should have gone back to the drawing board.
1844137864|5.0|Absolutely took my breath away..<br />Love the purity of his art and the insight to his mind this book provides is delightful.
B0073XORCY|5.0|Another 5-Star GEM by Mr. Anderson and company. There's a lot going on so repeated<br />listens are required for the full effect. Sounds great on the stereo! I'm wondering if a trilogy is developing here. Maybe a TAAB3 with Gerald in his senior years looking back on his entire life. Can't wait. Thanks Mr. Anderson and company.
B00466HM28|5.0|I got this about a month ago and oh my gosh, its awesome.  If you are a beginner or a pro, this will come in handy.  I am just starting with it and right off the bat i can make beats and i have almost made a whole dubstep song by using the pads and knobs and the keyboard.  this is the whole package, its fast, and its great.  amazing product.
B007MDB71O|3.0|I appreciate the movie. But, since I already have a Blu-Ray player, I don't need a DVD version, and I don't need a digital copy ever either. So why the (vulgar expletive) should I have to pay for all that unnecessary extra (expletive)? Disney continues to overkill their releases of their films, making it outrageously more expensive than it should have to be.<br /><br />Anyway, the one thing that may help sell a relatively lame story is to, at least, have one hot scantily clad babe to platonically seduce its male viewing audience.  And Lynn Collins as Dejah Thoris is certainly not hard on the eyes.<br /><br />But, one big disappointment with this Blu-ray release is that alot of the scenes appear rather soft or mildly blurred. Not really sharp like you would expect from a new film in a High Definition standard.  So, maybe this reduced quality is suppose to help them re-sell this movie again later when then want to announce re-releasing \\"John Carter: 2015 re-mastered in 4K High Definition\\".  So that remains to be seen.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|this is similar to Mario brothers game...the controls work great...fun to play...one of the better games out there and it is free
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|My only complaint is you can't sell or delete buildings.  Other than that an all around good game.  I'd recommend. this to all Oregon Trail fans.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|this is a really cool and addicting app!!!. it is like a remix  of super Mario!! I would recommend this game to anyone!! :)
B007KQ6XYY|1.0|I did not like this app I should get it for free not the 99&cent; I paid. great for people who want to waste their money on this piece of junk.

B006KX3GXO|5.0|this app provides people with a good way to edit photos. if you don't like the way one border looks change it with effects you might see professionals use. also a drawing tool. on and off photos. plus a framing tool. ive created many very good photos on this app. and oh yeah the price free. there was nothing missing from this app I wanted. I got it to use on one photo and ended up with about 100 edited photos. plus on smartphones u can use your camera to take a picture while your on the app. also with croping and stickers and other things you would look for in a photo editor. works great on kindle fire.
B00785P2QC|4.0|this game is very cute perfect for my daughter<br />hmmm but its like a lot of others with the energy and all that the first one was much better to be honest.but both good

044024238X|5.0|When I read this story, it made me think of our daughter and all her friends.  I am having them all read it.<br />Told them to take a deep breath and smell the roses.  Life is too short to be measured by appointments and<br />chores.  The children grow and are gone before you realize it.  Your parents are gone before you've had a<br />chance to talk with them.  Take a close look at your values and make some changes NOW
B002MQYOFW|4.0|I finally succumbed to peer pressure, I'm weak, but for whatever my two cents might be worth in this ever changing economy here is my take on Hunger Games. First let me issue a disclaimer in that I read this book expecting the worst. I'd held off reading Suzanne Collins' book because the very premise, as I understood it, made me queasy, and although I can lock and load as well as most Southern women I've no stomach for senseless killing. That said I was surprised, and give the book 4*.<br /><br />So with the same trepidation with which I read Twilight, no one does vamps like Ann Rice, I should do as well as Stephenie Meyer's, and I would have a lovely new beach house. Again a big surprise. I began Hunger Games and I couldn't put down my Kindle until two in the morning and three days later.  By now you've read a gazillion reviews that praise the book and a few that consider the writing simplistic. I think the Hunger Games is neither. Over 6 thousand readers at www.Amazon.com gave the book 4.5 * so I won't waste your time with technicalities. For me, I found the book to be mesmerizing in the way people pass by terrible accidents and are unable to look away. For a writer who loves to read with a passion the book hooked me from the get go and that makes any book a success.<br /><br />Everyone, so it seems, has interpreted a different message in the book, and in listening to the debates I imagine Ms. Collins cringing at some of the comments. I only read the one and have not decided if I'll read the other two books yet. The Hunger Games is still digesting. Listening to the few interviews Ms. Collins gave, I hope my take doesn't make her shudder. In her interview, she referred to reality TV as having, in part, inspired her Trilogy. That speaks volumes for TV and not in a positive light.<br /><br />My one pervading thought, which I've been unable to shake since reading The Hunger Games by Suzanne Collins, is \\"All that is necessary for the triumph of evil is that good men do nothing.\\" (Edmund Burke).<br /><br />Today there are so many things happening all around we need to remember that yes one person can make a difference. One vote at a time, one person and one voice at a time, then eventually the one becomes many.[...]).    Today there are so many things happening all around we need to remember that yes one person can make a difference.

1451648537|4.0|I just finished Steve Jobs biography.  I never really knew anything about him except that he was an icon in the computer industry.  The book was given to me by my boss who suggested that I would enjoy it.  It sat on my night stand among a pile of other books for quite a while.  I finally picked it up, started it on Wednesday and finished it on Saturday night.  In between my daily obligations, I spent every waking hour reading this book.  I will never look at an Apple product the same way again.  The connection he had to the products he created was incredible.<br />I had mixed feelings about the way he treated people.  As a practicing Buddhist who values the concepts of compassion and equanimity, I cringed at some of the interactions he had with others and the callous way he tended to treat people.  I think he suffered immensely and was extremely sensitive yet he didn't seem to see the suffering or sensitivity in others.  I can only hope in those last days of his life, he was finally able to let go.<br />That being said, I think he was an incredibly inspiring man who will go down in history among the great inventors of our time.
B005J4TLN4|4.0|\\"Attack the Block\\" is a nifty little trifle of a movie with some emotional heft to it thanks to performances by a bunch of new faces and some surprising charm.<br /><br /> Others have criticized some of the protagonists as thugs.  They left out how those characters become more and more well-rounded as the movie goes on,  which is one of the movie's chief charms.<br /><br /> Simply put, the alien invasion is extremely localized and effects the inhabitants of one council estate in south London.  As the characters first discover and fight the aliens,  we learn more about all of them,  and get our pants charmed off us, thanks to the cast of mostly unknowns.  That the movie didn't stick to literal black and white characterization is a bone of contention for some,  because some of the reviews dismissed the characters based on the first five minutes of the film, and ignored the rest of the movie, which served as a kind of atonement as they join forces and change alliances.<br /><br /> I'd characterize it as mostly comedy with a bit of sci fi thrown in for fun,  with some often sharp little observations tossed in sneakily as the movie takes off. \\"Oh, he's in Ghana, is it? Why can't he help the children of Britain? Not exotic enough? Not going to get a tan?\\"  You can miss a lot of little details at the movie's breakneck pace,  but on rewatching the film loses none of its freshness.<br /><br /> There's a lot of bad language for people who care about that kind of thing,  and a standout in cast member John Boyega,  who's a real find.  I've seen him in at least one British TV show where he proved his surprisingly layered performance here was no fluke; he knocked that one out of the park as well.  The only real familiar face here is the guy who played Ed in Shaun of the Dead, another comic/horror hybrid that was delightfully novel.<br /><br />  I gave it four stars only because one has to reserve a fifth star for something.
1401937519|5.0|This is a heartfelt book that answers the basic question of what happens to us when we die.  Anita tells an unbelievable story about how she came back to life after her body had already started shutting down. Her life's history and how she reacted to mixed cultural expectations played a big roll in how she became so ill. The book is worth reading for the one message alone...what happens to us after passing. What a wonderful message!
B005HSG3VK|5.0|I love this cover.  I bought two-- one for my Kindle, one for my mom's-- and we are both very happy.  I am constantly flipping the elastic on and off as I pick up my Kindle numerous times during the day.  The elastic is securely attached and good quality.  There are a few dangly threads, but I could trim them off.  There is a bit of a line on the screen, I use a microfiber cloth to clean off my fingerprints every few days and the mark goes away then.  I don't think it is an Otterbox for the Kindle, but it is decent protection from everyday travel.  I think it is attractive and nicely fit to the unit.  It stands very well with the cover flipped back and into the slot.  I have had hardly any issue with it not standing securely.  The color choices are pretty nice too.  Well worth the $29 or so.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|lots of games to keep the kids busy. there is something for everyone here. kids are happy so I cant complain.

While reading about Shin I found myself emotionally yelling, praying, shouting advice, even though I knew from the start he had survived. My admiration for this young man is tenfold; I want him to be successful, to appreciate feelings on a human level and as time goes on, to hear how his life unfolds. The book is well written, explaining the how's and whys to help us understand things we simply don't see in America. Excellent read.

1594744769|5.0|When my daughter brought home Ransome Riggs's novel [[ASIN:1594744769 Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children]], I took one look at the cover and thought, \\"Oh, no.  That's creepy. That's weird.  That will keep me up at night.  It will have me checking the closets for ghouls before I shut the lights.\\"<br /><br />But my dad bought it for my daughter, and the little gold pretend-sticker on the cover said it was on the New York Times's best-seller list.  And the freaky photos are cool.  And my daughter is the very person who recommended the life-changing The Hunger Games to me just by not putting it down.<br /><br />So I had to read it, and I did.<br /><br />Riggs tells the story of Jacob, a loner and a bit of a misfit son of well-to-do parents whose grandfather dies a sudden and horrific death.<br /><br />With the support of his oddball shrink, he convinces his parents he needs to go to Wales for a break following the death.<br />In fact, he goes there to get to the bottom of his grandfather's gruesome end.  There, he travels through time to discover the inhabitants of a World War II-era orphanage who are like him.  They have some special gift that sets them apart from the rest of humanity.  They live outside of time in the world of September 3, 1941, which day repeats itself daily after the daily ritual annhiliation--until the disturbance to end all disturbances.<br /><br />Miss Peregrine's mythic world is a place of acceptance, kindness, love, and structure.  In such a world, magic is possible--including the magics of love and friendship and safety--because people are taken as they are for who they are.<br />Jacob is faced with the choice between the world outside time where he is understood and accepted or the other, human world where things are familiar and normal but he is seen as different, as a project to be dealt with rather than a human to be nurtured.<br /><br />What is normal, and what's worth having, and what shape does love take?  This book will leave you asking these questions--and unafraid of the peculiar photos that invite you into another way of looking at life.<br /><br />Jacob is in good company with those other literary heroes who challenge who we are, where we are, and what all we're making of being there.  Percy Jackson, Ponyboy Curtis, Meg Murry, and Shadow, make room for Jacob.you asking these questions--and unafraid of the peculiar photos that invite you into another way of looking at life.<br /><br />Jacob is in good company with those other literary heroes who challenge who we are, where we are, and what all we're making of being there.

B007G5K066|5.0|The movie was quite faithful to the excellent novel.  The performances were superb all around, especially Gary Oldman as George Smiley.  The film even looks like it was shot in 1973.  I hope the other two novels in Le Carre's  \\"Karla Trilogy\\" make it to the screen!
B003L77FYS|5.0|Castle is the first show from regular TV I have enjoyed in several years. (I cancelled cable & quit watching TV 6 years ago because there wasn't anything worth watching.) I stumbled across Castle by accident on amazon.com.  I am looking forward to season 4 on DVD. My only complaints would be the annoying songs/music (they're shooting for the 18-25 yr old group); a few too many \\"artsy\\" (annoying) camera angles/shots (again, must be shooting for the 18-25 yr old category); & sometimes a little too graphic on the dead bodies. But I enjoy the stories & the acting, & find it very entertaining. I also enjoyed that season 3 has had several guest stars from my generation, like Jane Seymour. GREAT show!!
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I am a mature 14 year old girl who constantly reads, and never has a book had such an effect on my life.  I can confidently say that this book has changed my life in a positive way!  I strongly recommend this book for teenagers and even parents.  Never have I read a book by an adult who has perfectly matched the mindset of a teenager as John Green has.<br /><br />I have become so obsessed by this book that after I finished it the 1st time, I started it over and read it a 2nd time.  And then a 3rd time.  I cried several times wile reading the book but it was worth every tear, and every person I know who likes to read, I recommend this book to, begging that they will take the time to read this incredible book.  You become so engrossed with the charaters` lives and you immediately fall in love with them.<br /><br />Now, for the summary.  Your narrator, Hazel Grace Lancaster, is a hilariously sarcastic 16 year old with terminal thyroid cancer and tumors in her lungs.  She must carry an oxygen tank with her because of her troubled breathing.  She has beome obsessed with the book &#34;An Imperial Infliction&#34; by Peter Van Houten, and shares her love with a boy she met in a Support Group: Augustus Waters.  Augustus Waters (aka Gus) is 17 and has osteosarcoma, so his life is not predetermined: he must live with uncertainty.  Most of you will be able to put 2 and 2 together and figure out that they fall in love, but that`s all I will tell you.<br /><br />I beg of you to read this book because I have becomed obsessed the way Hazel is obsessed with &#34;An Imperial Affliction&#34; and I wish for someone else to share in my joy!

B005OK722U|3.0|I had no expectations for this movie.  Not a fan of the series in general for a couple of reasons the main reason is that it's mindless horror (horror for the sake of being horror).  I view them as using gore to mask what is a bad premise/bad movie underneath.  Most of the series-horror movies eventually revert to this (or parody) when the premise wears thin.  If you develop the story and characters enough (even in a horror movie) you don't need much if any gore by definition because it becomes paradoxical to develop a character then cut him up 5 minutes later.<br /><br />Anyway, this particular sequel isn't that bad but it's still not good.  Characters are bland, premise is ultra thin, excessive plot holes, and ultra violent (but less so than the other hostel movies).  This is still a watchable \\"better b\\" movie just don't expect a masterpiece.  I think this is one of the cases where the budget doesn't match the ideas.  This movie cost 6 million to make and they've masked it extremely well.  Good weekend rental with a couple of beers.

B0059XTTW8|3.0|Throw soldier and spy in the title and you'll turn a fairly bland british set piece into an action movie!  No...no...you won't.  You'll find out where the title comes from near the end of the movie (those are codenames except \\"spy\\").  What you end up with is a semi-political mystery movie done in british (and scottish) accents.<br /><br />It's watchable but it's not enjoyable because it drags a bit, the story is bland, and it feels like a long movie.  The trailers (when it was in theaters) for this movie were not accurate (played up like an action thriller) the cover for the dvd is; you'll watch a bunch of old men talk for long periods of time about communist infiltrators in british \\"intelligence\\".
B004EPZ07K|5.0|once again we see how much the everyday public likes to pan things they don't understand.  I was never a huge fan of Green lantern as a comic book charecter.  I knew that he had a green costume and a power ring.  that was it.  But what i loved about this movie was that Ryan Renolds was able to bring life into a somewhat stagnant charecter.<br /><br />We are introduced to the green lantern and the Green lantern Corps.  The corps are an intergalactic police force who strive to keep order in the universe.  Every occupied planet has one Green lantern, who has absolute control over the green energy weilding in this ring.  The ring then can be used as energy constructs, making every creative thought that the lanturn thinks into reality.  The main villian was Parralax, a based charecter who uses fear like the lanturns use creative willpower energy.  The only drawback was that Parralax seemed to be a cloud based monster who chose to act through a man named Hector Hammond.  Hammond was the evil that was battled, and we only see Parralax at the very end.<br /><br />Please tell DC to make Green Lantern 2!

1463514581|5.0|This book refuses to be left alone until you finish reading it.  After the first page or two just give up the fight and keep reading.  Twenty-eight and a half wishes is a Kindle freebie gem.<br /><br />This is a great first of a series about a 24 year old Southern woman, Rose,  who has had no life experience whatsoever, lives in a small town with and takes care of her incredibly abusive mother, and has no friends due to her ability to see into the future.<br /><br />This is a story of Rose learning to enjoy life - if she can stay alive long enough.<br /><br />There is romance, humor, adventure, mystery, murder, laughter and tears all in one book that is absolutely impossible to put down for long.  Some characters are delightful, some delightfully evil but all are interesting.  The reader gets enough information to develop the characters and keep the story going but not so much that the reader is skimming to the next page.  Even though Rose has had a troubled time, she also has a pervasive joy for discovering the simple fun life can bring.  The author has developed a very strong character with no sporadic confidence whose past is beyond sad but whose future is bright.  It is not unusual in this story to be smiling with a tear in your eye while worried if everyone will live through the next harrowing encounter.  Being able to elicit all of these emotions at once requires some gifted writing.<br /><br />This is an entertaining book with southern charm and I highly recommend it if you enjoy romantic suspense novels.
B00656C6KK|5.0|Disclaimer: I am a hard-core Doris Day fan -- she is the singer I consider my absolute favorite, and very few even come close. But I was prepared to be somewhat disappointed for one reason: many (in fact, 10 out of 13) of the tracks on this CD were recorded in the 1980s, long past the peak of her voice. But when I heard this CD it was clear: Doris, though well below her peak (you can hear this when you compare those 10 tracks to the 3 that were recorded in the 1950s and early 1960s!) is still, on these tracks, a better singer than most of the ones I've heard, with a better voice and a better feel for the music.<br /><br />Part of the reason this CD was released was, of course, Doris Day's desire to provide a memorial to her late son, Terry Melcher, who died at a relatively young age 8 years ago. So the tracks feature several songs that he co-wrote, and one that he actually sings -- his voice, actually, which I never heard before, was pretty good, though I still like his mother's better!<br /><br />In Doris Day's peak years of the 1950s, of course, a singer like Doris day had little choice in what she could record. Doris Day would sing the songs Mitch Miller picked for her, and other artists had a similar lack of choice; the liner notes in this CD make this clear. So it is interesting to see what kind of tracks were selected when Doris Day herself could choose the songs to be included. Some are relatively familiar, including such songs as \\"Daydream\\" and one that also showed up on her fairly recent release \\"The Love Album\\": \\"Life Is Just a Bowl of Cherries.\\" Others, including all of Terry Melcher's compositions on the disc, are totally new to me. But all seem well suited to Doris Day's style, and the whole disc is a great addition to my music collection.<br /><br />In short: Perhaps not up to the standard of 1950s Doris Day, but still more worthwhile listening than most of what is available today!
B0073XORCY|5.0|Okay here's my 2 cents worth. Background check, I've been a Jethro Tull Junkie for over 35 years. Having every CD I'm slightly qualified to give an opinion LOL ! ( But who cares right ? ) I for the first time in all these years  delayed my purchase of a Tull release (TAAB2). Why ? because for whatever reason I read so many of the critical reviews I was reluctant . And although I'm a fan, I'm also highly critical of their music. That's because with all the damn money I've put in their pockets, they are like family LOL ! ( Sometimes dysfunctional) The playing is inspired, the first in many years. Lyrically compelling and actually quite fun. I think, which I shouldn't sometimes, feel that the expectations of this CD are way out of whack. People, Ian's a senior citizen now. He's not the same man. This is not a bad thing he's just got more mileage. Fine wine to some. Maybe the criticism is because of the title. Maybe other than the lyrics this shouldn't have been the originals follow up. The musicianship doesn't sound like classic Tull. I love Barre , Evans , and the great Barlow. The players on this are great but as a musician I feel I could play on this CD. Where as with the original crew, they were always 1 step ahead of the rest of us. It sounds more like an Anderson solo, which it is !!! But one with balls intelligence and familiarity. I think it's a great CD I will listen many times over. I already have. Don't listen to the Naysayers. 2 Thumbs up and one middle finger to the rest :-).
B005Y423ZC|5.0|I first started listening to Adele about a year ago.  I saw this dvd around Christmastime, but didn't pick it up until recently.  Her live performance is simply outstanding.  Her studio work is great on its own, but seeing the live performance with how she presents her vocal talents and delivery with such ease, to me, is astounding.  If you have a passion for music, and enjoy the melodic union of vocals and instrumentation, you will NOT be disappointed with this DVD.  She is a grounded and inspired soul, who happens to have a very sassy way about her.  She engages with fans and has a wicked sense of humor, which makes her even that much more enjoyable to watch.  I can't wait to see her live some day myself because this woman was born to sing.  Enjoy.  I did.  Very much so!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|(Spoilers here and there)<br />When I picked up the third installment of the Hunger Games series to read, I was expecting to see a half baked and rushed novel that somehow would leave a hollow feeling after reading the book. This was what I gathered after looking at the distribution of the reviews : 1/4th of them have rated it with one star. And in all honesty, I was expecting a disaster of a book. But this book has pretty much satisfied all my expectations. So I thought I will put in my own two cents here.<br /><br />The Hunger Games series was not all about love, it never was. That was the first thing anyone who began reading this series should have noticed - a dystopian society where a powerful Capitol was sending children to their deaths to suppress an uprising. That sets the tone for the series. Not Katniss, not Gale, not Peeta. Sure, the romance angle helps move the story along, but the story was never just about them. It was never just about whom Katniss will end up with. I am surprised a lot of readers went into the third series hoping to find a love story that ended happily ever after. Not that they shouldn't have, but that never should have been their sole expectation.<br /><br />In my view, the ending is depressing in a way, yet it is real. PTSD is a serious issue, veterans go through them, suffer from them, with many just shutting themselves out of their immediate surroundings for years, unable to deal with the trauma they faced when they saw one of their comrades get KIA (There is an excellent PBS documentary series titled \\"This Emotional Life\\", for anyone who is interested). And yet, here we are, talking about a \\"selfish\\" 17 year old who witnessed her sister and many of her friends get killed horribly, and we complain that the story did not end with her holding hands with the chosen one in a lushy meadow. I would think it would help if we could remind ourselves about what we were doing and the decisions we were taking when we were 17 years old. Whichever way you think about it, both Katniss and Peeta had suffered significant trauma to just spring back into life, feeling all gung-ho. Heck, people take a year to get over a simple breakup and yet we are upset those two characters didn't just put everything behind and move on.<br /><br />To me, the book is a fantastic read because I had my expectations right. Of course, I would've expected the death of Finnick and Prim to be handled better, given the emotional investment we have in these two. But that doesn't make it bad book after all - remember, Snape and many others were killed off in such a way in HP7, yet we accepted that as a necessary fallout in the war against the dark lord.<br /><br />I would urge readers to go in without expecting a M&B story and you will not be disappointed.er way you think about it, both Katniss and Peeta had suffered significant trauma to just spring back into life, feeling all gung-ho.

B0050DIWFC|5.0|OK, wowzer is a corny word, but this book really needs a word that draws your attention so you won't miss reading it.  I ofter hear reviewers compare one author and/or book to another and don't agree at all.  This book is being compared to Scott Turow's \\"Presumed Innocent\\" and for once I agree.  It's told in the first person by Andy Barber, the assistant DA and father of Jacob, a 14 year old accused of murder.  I don't think it would have been nearly as interesting told any other way.  Andy is very tough and stoic, the reasons for which become clear as the story progresses.  But, because he's telling the story you get a better sense of just how deeply he was feeling the torment his family was going through and the lengths to which he would go to protect them.  You watch his wife fall apart through his eyes and some of the passages describing his feeling for her and their relationship are so touching they will bring tears to your eyes.  These three people made up a typical happy suburban family until this situation occurred.  Nothing is quite what it seems to outsiders, but apparently things were not as they seemed to Andy and his wife, Laurie, either.  Many of the reviews mentioned a shocking ending.  Despite this, I was totally blown away by the way he ended it.  This is an extremely well written, well developed and interesting novel.  Don't miss it!

0345308239|4.0|Barbara Tuchman has always been one of my favorite popular historians because she wrote better than many scholarly historians and she had a knack for capturing important facets of history and transducing them into simple but captivating themes. Some would say that she possessed Herodotus' skill at sifting through events and determining their greater meaning. In The March of Folly (1984), Tuchman decided to examine the role of folly - which she defines as a conscious decision to act against one's own best interests - in government, from Ancient times to the Vietnam War. As usual, the March of Folly was a darn good read; coherent, well-argued and studded with pithy observations. I felt that I learned something new or learned to think differently about something I already knew on almost every page - which is a rare quality in books today. On the other hand, I can't say that the author has really proved any grand hypothesis about the role of folly in human history - although her comments about how leaders make faulty decisions does ring true for our current leaders, as well. Nor was I so sanguine about all of the author's analysis of each of the three epochs involved, particularly the final section on Vietnam. Unlike her previous efforts on the First World War and the Middle Ages, the author strayed into personal bias about a period that she lived through and lost some of her objectivity along the way. It is easy to be wise after the fact, but Tuchman's deconstruction of how past leaders always had an alternative to the course of folly that they actually chose may not be valid in the real world.<br /><br /> The March of Folly is divided into three main sections, which discuss the Renaissance Popes and the beginning of the Protestant reformation, how Britain lost the American colonies and the United States in Vietnam. Tuchman uses these three examples to build her case that there is a common theme of political misjudgment in high-level decision-makers, particularly in powerful states or organizations. The section on the Renaissance popes in the period 1470-1530 is the shortest in the book, at about 72 pages. She certainly hits the nail on the head in depicting the corrupt antics of six of the worst popes, who through their vile behavior incited resentment and revolt against the Church. Tuchman notes that a large part of the problem was that these popes adopted the mores of medieval Italy, which was violent, corrupt and self-aggrandizing. However, the popes were hardly unique in their corruption, since most secular leaders at the time were just as self-serving. Marxists would say that this was the ideology of the ruling class in pre-modern Europe. It's not like the Reformation brought peace and prosperity to Europe - it brought war, persecution and ethnic cleansing. I also detected a bias by the author against the Church; she condemns the later revocation of the Edict of Nantes by Louis XIV in 1685, but says nothing about the policies of religious intolerance by English Protestants against the Irish that led to mass migration to America.<br /><br /> The section of Britain and the American colonies was particularly fresh because Americans tend to view this period through our lenses, but pay little attention to how and why the British made the decisions that led to a break. Tuchman views the period entirely through British perspectives and it reveals a great deal that is omitted from standard accounts. She quickly dismisses the whole `taxation without representation' argument deftly by pointing out how few Englishmen were actually represented in Parliament and that American agitators were not really interested in token seats in Parliament even if offered. She also does a great job with the hard numbers on revenue the British expected to raise with the Stamp Act and the cost to the British economy of American non-importation boycotts. Most of the British politicians are shown as amateurish twits, more interested in drinking themselvesto death and fox hunts than serious policy-making. British policies against the Americans are revealed as a series of incoherent and ad hoc efforts, not part of any coherent strategy. It is particularly revealing when she relates that no senior member of the British government bothered to visit the colonies or discuss issues with American opinion-makers in the decade leading up to the Revolution. As Tuchman concludes, the best British choice was not to try and impose a rule upon the colonies that they could not enforce, but to adopt a laissez-faire attitude that would have eventually allowed the Americans to move toward self-rule. While the American Revolution certainly served no British interest, it's hard to see how resigning oneself to the loss of a continent serves British interests, either.<br /><br /> The final section on Vietnam covers the period of US involvement from Truman to Ford, with the emphasis on LBJ's War. It's clear from the beginning that Tuchman wants to absolve Kennedy from any serious guilt, even though the establishment of MACV and the surge in advisors occurred on her watch. As Tuchman sees it, all the US leaders in this period either misread or ignored the tea leaves and plunged us into a no-win situation in Vietnam. However, her depiction of the war grows increasingly shrill throughout this section, beginning with an obscene generalization about \\"napalm amounted to official terrorism\\" by targeting civilians. She displays anti-military attitudes by writing that, \\"the military misleads from habit.\\" She suggests that the US military could not adjust to counterinsurgency warfare, but fails to note that spectacular growth and resources devoted to Special Forces. The author is quick to grasp at any straws, such as various UN overtures to Hanoi, as a means that we could have \\"gracefully exited\\" the conflict. In short, Tuchman's conclusion seems to be that when faced with poor alternatives, leaders should take the path of least resistance and run away.

B006C1DH92|1.0|whose bright idea is it to restrict playing the app when there's mo Internet connection? that just means nobody can show anybody this game anywhere. I guess game producers are too rich to ride the train or take the bus.
B001AQO3QA|3.0|Whoohoo, scary stuff and thrills by the hundreds. My eyes glued to the screen, I dare not look away for fear of missing the action and the thrills.

Beep, Beep and Beep such a simple thing to improve my swim stroke, now when I want to swim faster, I pull hard but at the same cadance.  I've applied cadance work in my run and bike drills, now I have a tool to adjust my cadance during swim workouts.  Very cool gixmo.<br /><br />Works great.
B005EGXTEE|4.0|If you love a book that hooks you in and keeps your interest the whole way through this is it.  You really do go on an adventure with this author.  You'll love and hate some of the characters and you won't be able to put it down.. Make sure you have the second book purchased cause you''ll want it close at hand the moment you finish this one.  I read Hunger Games and  Catching Fire back to back over the course of a day and a half.  I also really like that the saga loses no momentum between the first and second books - the story line just rolls on. Fantastic you won't regret your purchase.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|this game is fun I like building towns you should get this game . it works great on my kindle fire
B006YXTRHY|4.0|I've been waiting for the wedding forever!  It did a great job of showing the viewer sexual tension without showing to much.  It was a really beautiful movie to watch as far as settings and back drops are concerned.  Now I can't wait till the next one!!!
B006OCM0G0|5.0|Restaurant Story is very fun if you have patience. Yes, its a &quot;waiting&quot; game but its still very fun.<br />For the people that say it cost money, JUST DONT PRESS THE BUY GEMS BUTTON! its that simple, really.<br />You don't have to pay for this game unless you press buy gems, so if you don't want to pay any money don't get gems. That's all im saying.<br />Hope you love the game, I know I did.
B006VRZ5YM|3.0|It was a sweet movie.  Great for movie night with my sister.  It is a little dorky, glad I didn't see it in the theater and waitd for it to come out this way.
B003XF1XOQ|2.0|Can someone explain to me how this book even made it into the series? It is a total let down in every way and no way on par to the genius of the first two books!<br /><br />  First off, this book is painfully laced with Suzanne Collin's own anti-war political propo's (War is Hell!!! I get it innocent people die, children have their innocence crushed and become soldiers, war mongers scheme behind the scenes, and the possibility of total annihilation among other things.) But for god sakes, SC just character assassinated everyone of their value and pride and made them one denominational and hollow  shells of people with demons, drug and what seems like dementia!!! She did not seem to care at all, too!!. If she wanted to write a anti-war book she could have written it in a more sophisticated way but apparently she wanted to get her point across in a shallow blood bath of what...... forcing her opinion and promoting propaganda. I have absolutely no problem with a writer writing an anti-war book, but with such details for adults  but when 12 year old pick up this book it seems like a brainwashing experiment. I thought we are trying to teach these teenagers how to critically think in life!!!<br /><br />  Second, SC is seriously struggling with writing this book in first person narrative this time. Painfully..... soo!!! Katniss narration is very limited for such an epic grand scope, hunger, civil war, relationships, dystopian civilizations, etc. All of these things need a hell of a lot more description to do them justice. And it does not help that Katness, the narrator, at time is very distant or not able to see what really happening. Katness's doom and glum perspective kind of kills this book. I think that she should have just semi-abandoned her perspective, and let the other  characters tell their own story as well, it would only be fair since War,rebellion, and overthrowing the government is everyone business. It sounds strange but I had absolutely no idea what was goingon in this book half the time, poor writing.  The characters seemed bored and not themselves or too hard for Katness to relate to.  I think that a one year deadline is a very hard thing for a writer to make every time and not rush books. She should have got more time to write a beautiful ending. Darn you Scholastic!<br /><br /> Hunger Games and Catching Fire are soo much better books! Imaginative in every way! I can tell she took her time with them.<br /><br />My only hope is that who ever gets involved in the movie making aspect throws out this book!!! For real!!!  Starts from scratch and writes a true Mockingbird ending worthy of a great ending!!! Otherwise this series is going to get killed pretty quick in the audiences mind!!! These books are too deep and have such resiliency about them to get crappy movies made about them!
B006IGZWB2|4.0|Really good movie.  This era in US history is really sad.  Movies like this help us not forget, learn a bit more about our own country, and are fun to watch.

It made me cry throughout, as I remembered my own mother and aunts and uncles and I feel I'm a better person for having read it.  Please read this book!  Kathy Blondin-Stone

B003VANOFY|4.0|I'm glad I waited a while to review this.<br /><br />First off, the Pros.<br /><br />+ Amazing Sound Quality<br />+ Decent Mic Quality<br />+ Surround Sound<br />+ Wireless<br />+ G-Keys<br /><br />(There is also Voice Morphing, but customization is limited so I didn't note it in the Pros)<br /><br />Then of course, the Cons.<br /><br />- Finicky Charging<br />- Fragile Micro USB Port<br /><br />Now of course, the main problem I have with this headset is the Charging and Micro USB.  After about 2 months of use, charging became more difficult, causing me to adjust the wire in various positions to make the charge successful.  Eventually the adjusting caused the micro USB port to break, making the headset useless without a charge.  I would use the warranty to get it replaced or get my money back, but having lost the receipt and having this be considered an \\"Accident Driven Damage\\", I cannot get my money back.<br /><br />I would suggest finding a different model, maybe one with similar features instead for purchase.  But if you are willing to take the risk, keep the receipt and return it at the first sign of charging problems.

B002MQYOFW|5.0|I was hesitant at first about reading this series, but once I started I seriously could not stop. The first book sucks you in and leaves you wanting more with each page. The storyline is incredible, daring, and epic. Although the title stands for the games, this book ultimately leaves you hungry for more.

B00466HN6S|4.0|Not a huge fan when live-action and animated are thrown together into the same pot. In my experience it's exceedingly rare when the combination produces anything good. For every incredible '[[ASIN:B00007AJGH Roger Rabbit]]' - there's a dozen utterly deplorable '[[ASIN:B000SW4DMG Monkeybone]]' disasters.<br /><br />So I admit at having some trepidation putting down money and setting aside time to screen this latest entry into the genre.<br /><br />Tells the story of E.B. - the young heir to the long line of Easter holiday icons. Unfortunately, his interest lies less in his chocolate and sweet confectionary heritage, and more with two-stick bangers like [[ASIN:B000001ESP Neil Peart]] and [[ASIN:B00008BRB5 Stewart Copeland]]. His dreams involve pounding music, pounding beats, and pounding bunny babes, not delivering goodies to the children of the world.<br /><br />So what's a bunny to do? Escape to Hollywood of course.<br /><br />While not as explosively funny and creatively innovative as the Zemeckis rabbit production of years past - I was pleasantly surprised at how much I enjoyed this movie. It's bright, witty, and charged with enough go power to keep pace with an adult's expectation, while still delivering what's essentially a kids movie.<br /><br />Admittedly, I would've enjoyed a few more double-entr&eacute;des worked into the script like, \\"I am sick of doing Number Two - it is time for Number One!\\", but that's just the old fogey in me. Did love that E.B. did his business in the form jellybeans. Watermelon! Yum!<br /><br />Not.<br /><br />No surprise - the [[ASIN:B0015D43OA Jelly Belly Company]] wasn't offered a sponsorship deal. :-D<br /><br />Very enjoyable flick which ended with my wife asking me if it were time to add a cute floppy-earred friend to our family of felines. I said yes, with the understanding that I wouldn't partake in any morgue-type-CSI-clean-ups.<br /><br />Personal Note: Was kind of surprised to hear Bow Wow Wow's \\"I Want Candy\\" as the theme for this kids flick without any squawking from indignant parents. I suppose it's a sign of the passing decades that the original meaning of the song has been obscured and converted into a hip-hop dance ditty. No pun intended. I can remember when a constant near-naked, ground-humping 15-year old Annabella Lwin was the scandal-sensation-du-jour which helped fuel the fire that grew into the [[ASIN:0688167721 PMRC]].<br /><br />How times change. &lt;g>is kids flick without any squawking from indignant parents.

B005PK1G76|5.0|First-off, the Diono Buggy Buddy is identical to the Sunshine Kids version. The company has simply changed its name.<br /><br />When I first saw this product I thought, 'What a great looking product, I wonder if it would fit my stroller?' Browsing through some of the reviews I found it difficult to see if my stroller would be compatible. I thought other parents would also find this frustrating so I browsed through all of the reviews and summarized compatibility reports (as of Apr/2012). I omitted solo reports so only reports of 2 or more are included. hopefully this helps.<br /><br />2 - BJ City Elite<br />3 - BJ City Select<br />33- BJ City Mini<br />9 - BJ City Mini Double<br />2 - BJ Summit<br />7 - Bob<br />3 - Britax Light<br />6 - Britax B-Agile<br />2 - Bugaboo Cameleon<br />3 - Combi<br />6 - Graco Ipo<br />2 - Graco Duo<br />5 - Joovy Caboose<br />2 - Joovy Cooper<br />3 - Maclaren Quest<br />3 - Maclaren Techno<br />7 - Maclaren Triumph<br />3 - Maclaren Volo<br />9 - Peg Perego Aria<br />2 - Peg Perego Si<br />7 - Phil & Ted<br />4 - Quinny Zapp<br />21- Uppababy Vista<br />5 - Wheelchair<br /><br />Some quick pros and cons:<br />For ten bucks this is an excellent alternative to more expensive less convenient solutions. The buggy has lots of storage space including a zippered pocket.<br />I should note that although the buggy works well for numerous umbrella strollers, it should be removed before folding since the wiring around the top does not allow for buggy to fold with stroller. Overall 90% of the reports were 4 or 5 stars with the negatives reviews primarily reporting problems with broken straps.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|easy and good graphics. progress has been simple and tutorials are great. when there is nothing else to do this is a good time killer.
0439023491|5.0|Remember what I said in my review of Glow?  That, \\"I liked the first book but I'm not a fan [of The Hunger Games] either.\\"  I may have to take that back.  True, I am not over the moon about the first book in the trilogy but this, Catching Fire, is AMAZING.<br /><br />We meet with our heroine Katniss Everdeen after the 74th Hunger Games.  She's back in District 12 living in luxury in a new house in a well-to-do area together with the other winners, Haymitch and Peeta.  As the winners, Peeta and Katniss are required to tour Panem, being figureheads of hope for the people.  But after their little \\"stunt\\" in the arena, the people from the districts look to Katniss as the symbol for rebellion.<br /><br />The 75th Hunger Games coincide with the Quarter Quell.  Their mentor Haymitch won this Game 25 years ago.  Usually, the Reaping only doubles it's players but President Snow changes the rules for this year - the victors of the previous Hunger Games will enter the arena again. Katniss must prevent the countrywide rebellion and at the same time survive another round in the arena.<br /><br />I have not read a plot so solid and so well-constructed in a very long time.  Suzanne Collins may not be the best writer but the way she built this book is a thing of beauty.  I cannot single out anything specific because it'll give away something major but overall, I was just so wow'd.  It was so creative and I honestly cannot wait to see it translated on the big screen.  (Speaking of the first THG movie, I preferred that over the book.  I had doubts with the casting at the beginning but everything worked out just fine.)<br /><br />I still enjoy seeing the events through Katniss' eyes.  Collins is not the best at conveying emotion but she definitely knows how to shock and unsettle the reader.  If you think about it, the Hunger Games themselves are very violent.  I mean, how can you write about killing children in the most horrendous ways?  The author says it outright, no dilly-dallying.  And considering this series is aimed towards the younger adults, she doesn't go into the gory details of each kill or torture.  But it is still upsetting.<br /><br />The characters are also pretty cool.  My favorite so far in the series is Peeta.  Poor guy.  He's so unassuming, kind, and just an all around nice guy.  I admit that the love story between Katniss and Peeta was not my favorite in the first book but in this, I just felt so sorry for the guy.  Clearly, he loves Katniss and Katniss either doesn't love him back or is confused about her feelings.  The people are clearly pulling for Katniss to win the Games and Peeta is not getting that much love... even from his family.  It's just... so sad for something like that to happen to such a good guy.  I found myself smiling every time he says a line.  So yeah, I am Team Peeta.<br /><br />I like the transition from the first book.  This one definitely feels more grown up, it's grittier and darker.  The new characters add so much to the story.  In the first book, Katniss was mostly alone and there wasn't really much going on.  But with Finnick, Johanna, and the other victors in the picture, there's more action and adventure.  Even though there are a lot of characters, each had their own interesting personalities and I truly enjoyed everyone of them so much that their death scenes were hard to swallow.<br /><br />Overall, I think Catching Fire will go down as one of my favorites.  It is very well-crafted and it does make me want to read the third one right away.  You know what... maybe I will do just that.<br /><br />Rating: 5/5.<br /><br />Recommendation: READ IT.  Go ahead.  Buy into the hype!  It is well-deserved.  But you have to be familiar with the events of the first book (or movie, whatever) for your to fully enjoy it.And considering this series is aimed towards the younger adults, she doesn't go into the gory details of each kill or torture.

B003XF1XOQ|2.0|I'm not very good at writing reviews so I'll keep this short and sweet. This book bored me to tears. I lost all interest in the plot and characters half way through as it dragged on and on and on. Apparently there is a focus on the result of war on one's life and mind, but I simply was so bored that I completely missed all of it. I'm very disappointed as the first 2 books have such excitement in them.

B006JTS5OO|5.0|The Muppets is a movie the whole family can thoroughly enjoy. Some of the humor may be lost on young children but there are plenty of slapstick moments and silly antics that everyone can enjoy. The music was composed by Flight of the Conchords' Bret McKenzie, a comical lyric genius. The soundtrack is addicting. My kids and I have listened to it countless times and we still aren't sick of it. It really is a great movie for children and adults. A must have for any family but, heck, I'd even buy it if it was just me!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I am almost 63 years old and have been reading science fiction since I learned to read. Of late I have been trying to find an author who could hold his (her) own when held to the standards of Asimov, Clarke and the other great classic SciFi writers. This book, grabs you right from the start and doesn't let go until the end. I found myself reading in the dark, on my iPad, until I finished; foregoing sleep and common sense. The book is that good. Mister Howey, you need to charge more for your books, you are in the big leagues now.
B0064X7FVE|1.0|this is a great channel to watch, great website to go to, but the updates require to many permissions for my liking. why does this app need to record audio or do 80% of the permissions that it is asking for? simple answer it doesn't.
B0061S073A|5.0|Works as advertised. I can let my four year old play games and run learning apps without worry. Great application.
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|This book blew me away. It isn't going to win any literature awards, but I don't need every book I read to be a stroke of literary genius. What this book does do is transport me to a world which both tantalises and horrifies me and makes me crave more. It is a well paced, well written, page-turner that anyone who calls themselves a geek should read. I was so blown away that I'm literally writing this review on my Kindle after staying up late, unable to put the book down as I finished the final chapters. Buy. This. Book.

0439023513|3.0|The first two books were excellent, leading me to then believe that the third book is going to top them all... only it didn't. One issue that I could not get over was the mental instability of Katniss. The first two books your like, \\"My gosh, I wish I was as tough as her!\\" Then you get into the third book, and it sweeps you into this woe is me depression. I felt that her original spark fanished, and at the end of the book she comes off as a paranoid psycho. Another issue I had, were the loose ends the author left us with. For instance we never learn how the district interaction works, the new government, and the outcomes of the characters. For instance we never find out what happens to Caesar Flickerman, the citizens of the capitol, and the remaining victors after Panem is recaptured. The love triange turned out to be a joke, in that Gale never even tries to contact Katniss after she kills President Coil. This book's ending was just very frustrating, and seemed to be rushed through.
0439023521|5.0|I can 100% give the Hunger Games the honor of making me fall back into love with reading.  I always loved reading, but in recent years I had found myself fallen out of love.  When I first picked up the book, I was skeptical.  When my librarian had recommended it to me, I was skeptical.  Thirty pages in, I was completely hooked and did not put down the book until I finished Mockingjay.  I can't say Collins is the best writer ever, but there is no doubt that she had a story to tell.<br />The stories compelling love story, struggle to survive, and great overall message makes it a book well deserving of all of the press it has been receiving recently.<br />Do yourself a favor and read it for the love of reading
1608870081|5.0|The pop up is amazing. Some of the pages are a little bit scary. Well, Harry Potter is a scary movie anyway.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|reminds me of the original Mario. Lots of fun with a new twist. vacant be very addictive. agraphics are cool too.
B006ZCWU5K|5.0|One of Springsteens best in the last few years. Not that Magic and Working on a Dream were bad, they weren't. But this album reminds me of some of the older Bruce stuff but with new twists. I have found myself listening to it over and over and liking it more each time. A must have for even the casual Bruce fan.
B00498TQV8|3.0|Jennifer Lawrence and John Hawkes are brilliant. The scenery is dreadfully Meth-Country but the film is a bit too brooding and removed for its own good. Aesthetics only do so much to cover a familiar narrative. Despite the realistic locales, most movie-goers will recognize too much, be enthralled in too little. When the chase through the ominous rodeo pen arrives to draw Lawrence's journey from its slogging progression, it is almost too late to salvage things. The ending does reward the patient, in a subdued, unsettling manner. In fact, the ending stings. Family endures. After its over, expect to feel cold inside.
B0063IH60K|5.0|great game tap and the cards go automatic. great for when you are waiting and need to kill time.graphics are clear.
B002ZG980U|4.0|Inception is full-scale intrigue, weaving meta narratives in an agonizingly impeccable jumble. The leads are likable, despite at least one character being used almost exclusively to ask expository questions. The action sequences are brilliantly shot and constantly enrapturing, with the exception of a late winter shoot-out which resembles a level of Call of Duty more than it does a brainy summer blockbuster. Nevertheless, there is no real reason not to call this film the work of an auteur: one of the best minds of his generation. Prepare to ponder the twirling totem at the center of your dreamscape.
B002IFT1ZA|5.0|Loved the books and these DVDs bring the books to life. The acting is great and visually, the scenes are wonderful. if you loved the books, you'll love these DVDs.
B006QVRVJK|3.0|Carnage begins with semantics. \\"Armed with a stick\\" vs. \\"Carrying a stick.\\" From here, it gradually builds into brutality. Four parents in one room, during one long school day. The film is a deconstruction of the shell of upper-class Americanism. Everything is icy and detached, down to the serving of the cobbler. No one wants to fight at first. One character is only interested in taking his business calls, snorting and giggling as everyone waits, rapt, unsettled, for him to finish. Then, slowly, allegiances falter and are reassigned. Venom begins to course and flow. Each actor in the film is stellar, particularly relative newcomer Christoph Waltz and the ever-ravishing Kate Winslet. Jodi Foster is effectively nonplussed and John C. Reilly plays his affable slow-man to a point and then tips over into madness (reminded me a little of Richard Burton in Albee's landmark Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf). The film suffers from contrivances. It takes a lot to believe that these people stay in the room together as long as they do. The attempts at keeping them together (oh, we forgot to have coffee! Oh, we forgot to have a drink!) just don't seem believable. After an episode of vomiting and rage, most normal humans would be out the door, down the elevator, and way far away. Nevertheless, everyone sticks around long enough to get trashed and expose one another as smug, accountable heathens. Polanski, working from source material some decade or so old, manages to keep things feeling fresh and Post-9/11 paranoid. His direction is understated, allowing the actors to provide all the intrigue, cringes, and so forth. The film is sticky and high-brow, packed with wit and vinegar. The last shot of an idyllic pastoral landscape is superb, juxtaposed as it is after so much nebulous verbal-warfare. Carnage never reaches its potential, however, do to its cramped setting and the limitations therein. Must have been a marvelous time at the theater. Too bad it couldn't stay there.
B002VWNIDG|4.0|A must-have for fans of classic horror movies and/or Jack Nicholson fans. Many x and y generationers may find this one holds a particular place in mind, as it may be one of the first that scared you as a kid. Jack Nicholson, as always, delivers an great performance as a deranged husband/writer with one of his most memorable movie quotes: \\"Here's Johnny\\"!
B007PTJOV0|5.0|the game is bacicaly just a Mario but your a lepercan! the game is so cool I would reccomend this game Ps my xbox 360 gamertag is Damoocher87
B006IGZX0C|5.0|The movie was very easy to order and download onto my Sony player. Picture was clear and the sound was very good. One of the best movies that I have seen in a long time. Was glad that it was recommended to me by a friend.
B0000024ZT|5.0|Bruce Springsteen  \\"Greetings From Asbury Park, N.J.\\"  #60  (1973).<br /><br />After his run with his band Steel Mill, Bruce Springsteen's debut \\"Greetings From Asbury Park, N.J.\\", is a very strong debut.  This is not a classic in the \\"Born To Run\\" and \\"Darkness On The Edge Of Town\\", but this album has 8 strong songs.  3 of these songs have been covered by Manfred Mann's Earth Band, \\"Blinded By The Light\\", \\"For You\\" and \\"Spirit In The Night\\", all these songs are classic Springsteen.  Other tunes of note are, \\"Angel\\", the tragic \\"Lost In The Flood\\", \\"It's Hard To Be A Saint In The City\\", the lyrical \\"Does This Bus Stop At 82nd Street\\" and a favorite of mine \\"Growin' Up\\".  \\"The Wild, The Innocent & The E-Street Shuffle\\", came out in late 1973.
B007BLEKPM|4.0|The movie was very easy to order and download onto my Sony player. Picture was clear and the sound was very good.
B0002ADY0Q|5.0|Uriah Heep  \\"Salisbury\\"  #103  (1971).<br /><br />Uriah Heep's second album 1971's \\"Salisbury\\", is just a great album.  Again they struggled in England, but made a steady climb up the U.S. charts.  Tours in Germany and other European countries kept them in the public eye.  Keith Baker would join on drums.  On this album we get, the way-wah of \\"Time To Live\\", everyone knows about the Uriah Heep classic  \\"Lady In Black\\", the bass by Paul Newton is just top notch on this song, this song should of made the top 40 back in the day, great vocals by Ken Hensley.  \\"High Priestess\\", is an all out rocker.  \\"The Park\\", acoustic piece, great vocals by David Byron.  Another version of \\"Bird Of Prey\\", the 16 minute orchestrated title track is superb!, nice listen, the band did good here.  \\"Simon The Bullet Freak\\", good rhythms, good tune.  \\"Here Am I\\", very progressive sounding, 8 minutes of good UH music.  Get the expanded edition, great sound.  \\"Look At Yourself\\", came out in late '71.
B0072GPQNG|4.0|if this is a decent war movie about ww1? my grandfather fought in it and i want to buy this but not if its only got one or two minutes of the war etc.....thanks
B007PTJOV0|5.0|it is like Mario bros lots of fun.  kids like it and it is e tertainjng.  controls are easy to use.
B006W0QOF2|1.0|It features the cutest couple I have ever seen, with Ryan Gosling as what's his face (OH YEAH, HE DOESN'T GET A NAME!!!!!!!)and what's her face as Irene...Actually, I'm kidding, this movie was a waste of time and space for anyone who produced, acted, or watched it. The best part of it was that adorable little kid. That's it, literally. PSA: READ THE DARN REVIEWS BEFORE YOU PURCHASE/WATCH A FILM. YOU'LL THANK ME FOR IT.
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|It is awesome but your energy runs out to fast. Please consider my reviews. o j f s t h u p
B003G4W4CY|4.0|Arthur Clarke: great scientific mind and great writer. In my opinion his greatest virtue is the quality of his work which does not have the ups and downs of other writers, even those that \\"play\\" (i.e. write) in his league. In this respect, \\"Childhood's end\\" is another great story. He had my total respect ever since I stumbled upon his \\"2010:Odyssey 2\\" 26 years ago (yeah, I read 2010 before I even knew that 2001 was his, what can you say, teenagers, right??) and I can honestly say that I feel his abscence. Anyway, enough with the personal stuff, bottom line is if you like science fiction, you have to read Arthur Clarke's work and \\"Childhood's end\\" is as good a start as any...
0385737955|5.0|I enjoyed reading this book. Couldn't put it down. I just finished reading the second book in this series, and it was better than the first (this one). I am an adult 31yr old woman, and I enjoyed Twilight, and Hunger Games, this book is along the same lines, but a male as the main character. Wish the author would have written the book in the first person, but it was fine. Buy all three at once, I wish I had, now I am waiting on the third.... :)
B0052UZIFA|5.0|this game is by far the best game ever. I love it! its a long game so it ls worth the $3s. me I didn't find anything wrong with the game. I'd recommend it to anyone:).
0345803485|5.0|This is a great book!  I was instantly hooked from the first few pages!  I can not wait to read the other books in the series!
B007PTJOV0|5.0|this games great, if you like Mario games y'all like this one. it has good cartoon graphics and its really easy
B003ZTQN1I|1.0|This is different from what you hear in the movie and I think the movie version is better.<br />The voice and music in this soundtrack sounds old and too \\"country\\" to me. Maybe somebody enjoys that but this is definitely not what I expected when I decided to buy the CD.<br />I suggest they should put a different name on this album instead of saying this is the original soundtrack.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|This is a great game. Its only flaw is that it crashes too often and it runs out of energy too fast. Other than that it's fun and a great way to pass time.
B005LLXB9K|4.0|While I really enjoyed this film I think it really could have been called 10 , as it really finishes after the first ten years of the bands life, or maybe Cameron should have just made a film about the Seattle scene and left it at that.<br />For me it is the last ten years of this bands life that are the most interesting, and while Crowe touches on the journey this band have made I felt he just let it peter out, maybe he had just had enough of making the film.<br />A really good film, but could have been better if the director had decided what kind of film he was making. Had me heading back to my Pearl Jam CDs though!
B004EPZ0BG|2.0|When I received the DVD in the mail, the plastic DVD case was completely destroyed.  The whole top half of the case was in 20+ pieces and a crack went down the side casing. The DVD was unharmed but if better packaging and handling measure had been taken, I would also have a case for the movie.
B004LOMB2Q|4.0|Very adapt at sharing and linking ALL types of data. I use it for work and personal persuits. Very handy!
B007PTJOV0|5.0|fun to play reminds me of mario. husband likes it too. easy levels love the character. play it all the time.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|took some getting used to the buttons playing on the kindle fire but it's fun. very comparable to Mario bros.
0439023483|5.0|Truly heart breaking and thrilling, I couldn't put this book down or the other 2 in the trilogy!!! If only she could write me some more it would be  amazing! I was heart broken when I finished them. This book made my hear bleed for the characters and kept me guessing right to the end. It's true meaning is a warning too us all!
B0000004V2|5.0|Every band/artist releases an album that's a game-changer. Either it's the band's magnum opus or a watershed moment that changes the music industry forever. In rare cases, the album fits in both categories. THE STONE ROSES is one of those albums.<br /><br />Like many great British alternative rock albums, THE STONE ROSES doesn't get much love in the United States, for a variety of reasons, some sensible, some illogical. One illogical reason is the Stone Roses sounded \\"too British\\". But then that's like saying that John Lennon's music didn't work because he didn't sound like Bob Seger. A more sensible reason is that the Stone Roses were part of the now-forgotten Madchester scene, which was a movement where British rock bands fused acid-house dance rhythms and melodic pop, filled with catchy choruses, psychedelic flourishes and chugging beats. They owed as much to the Beatles, the Rolling Stones and the Kinks as Funkadelic, Sonic Youth and the Jesus and Mary Chain. That movement became obsolete for two reasons: 1.) Bands like the Stone Roses fell prey to drug abuse that hindered their music; and 2.) Nirvana's NEVERMIND was released in 1991 and grunge became the forefront in 1990's popular music. It also didn't help that the Stone Roses didn't follow up their debut until 1996, with the critically maligned SECOND COMING.<br /><br />But to say that is to make unfair generalizations. NEVERMIND and THE STONE ROSES were amazing albums; it's just that THE STONE ROSES was more of a victim of bad timing, the changing music climate and American rock fans' prejudice towards anything British. But time has a way of healing wounds and now THE STONE ROSES deserves its rightful place as one of the greatest and most influential alternative rock albums of all time.<br /><br />What makes THE STONE ROSES unique? Well, let's talk about the band: The Stone Roses were a traditional guitar-pop band that happened to love dance beats. Ian Brown had a detached singing that recalled Morrissey; John Squire was a skillful guitarist that created psychedelic guitar hooks and simple, layered melodies; and Reni and Mani represented the unique rhythm section that helped make their songs less heavy and more groovy. They were a band that treated pop, rock and dance as if they were one, rather than three, entities. In short, they made rock music that you could also dance to.<br /><br />THE STONE ROSES, their debut album, crystallizes that attitude perfectly. Each song unfolds one by one, creating a colorful, neo-psychedelic world that sounds retro but feels modern. \\"I Wanna Be Adored\\" builds on a pulsating bass-line, cool guitar hooks and before Reni's slamming percussion and Brown's crooning vocals come in to play; \\"Waterfall\\" is a relaxing ballad that sounds every bit as aquatic as a waterfall; \\"Bye Bye Birdman\\" is a lovely fusion of psychedelic pop and rolling beats; \\"This is the One\\" is the kind of song you would play at a celebration party; and \\"I Am the Resurrection\\" is an epic as heavy as Zeppelin's \\"Kashmir\\". Even the filler tracks intrigue: \\"Don't Stop\\" is basically \\"Waterfall\\" played in reverse.<br /><br />But the album's best song is \\"Made of Stone\\". With its opening gel-like guitar riff and a chuggy bass and fast-paced percussion that provides the beat and the rock while Ian Brown croons about fantasizing when the streets are cold and lonely, \\"Made of Stone\\" is the epitome of the band's trademark sound and the Madchester movement. Released as the album's first single, it should've been a huge hit in the UK and at least made a dent at the Billboard charts. Thankfully, the second single, the rollicking \\"She Bangs the Drums\\", was more successful.<br /><br />THE STONE ROSES, along with The Smiths' QUEEN IS DEAD, was cited as a major influence on a generation of 90's British rock bands like Oasis, Blur and Pulp. Indeed, it's hard to imagine Pulp's \\"Common People\\", Oasis' \\"Supersonic\\" and Blur's \\"Girls and Boys\\" without \\"Elephant Stone\\", \\"This is the One\\" and\\"Made of Stone\\". But it also should be praised because it is a fantastic record in its own right: diverse, exciting and rewarding on multiple listens. Even if NME failed to recognize the album, it would still be considered a classic today. It's tempting to avoid listening to the album given the reasons that I explained. But trust me, buy this album and you won't regret the purchase. Get it while you still can.<br /><br />BONUS:<br /><br />As a bonus, there are a couple of versions of THE STONE ROSES: the original UK version and the US version that contains the fantastic \\"Elephant Stone\\". Then another US version that does not include \\"Elephant Stone\\" but \\"Fool's Gold\\", the band's most popular track. In addition, there's a 20th anniversary deluxe set that contains 2 CDs and 1 DVD of the album. But either version is a worthwhile purchase to anyone whose new to the band and those anyone who has followed the band since its formation in the late 1980's.\\"Made of Stone\\".

B007PT3QOQ|5.0|great game fun and exciting well worth the price of addmision.  great way to pass the day at work and look like you are working
B005UG542S|4.0|This movie plus the next completed our set of Harry Potter movies. This was as good as expected and worth watching. We have now done a Potter marathon of all the movies, in two days.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|I love Lep's world. it is awesome!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! it is great for when you are in a ( n) airplane, car,  etc.
0439023513|5.0|This book was very different from the first two books in that it did not have the reaping of the tributes and the \\"Hunger Games\\" as we saw in the first two books.  This book was about an all out revolutionary war against the Capital.  However, there are aspects of the hunger games arena when they are invading the capital and have to face the pods that are part of the capitals defense system.  The main character matures a lot in this book and is faced with very different challenges.  In the end she makes some tough choices that prove how capable she was at overcoming even the greatest obstacles and deceptions.  I like the way the third book in this trilogy ties up all of the lose ends with each of the characters.  This is a well written, captivating book.
B005U9RQNU|5.0|As I said, too cool for words!  Check it out.  You won't be sorry.  This is a great example of the bad guy getting exactly what he deserves.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|easy and addictive. I wish he didn't slide so easily off the side, but still bey very fun. will recommend to friends.
B0061QD82E|5.0|Yeah, it's Disney at its best.  What more can be said about this classic?  Not much.  You'll laugh, you'll cry.
B0052U59F4|5.0|After hearing reviews about this book, I had to buy it.  Everyone was right, it is difficult to put down.  I cannot wait to read the next two books in the series!!!!
B000X2H8G4|5.0|I like this little guy.  You can pretend you're an on-the-scene reporter and hold the fuzzy mike right up to folks.  You'll never miss a word, and they'll crack up!  Lots of fun.  UPDATE: 2/2015: I got very frustrated with my hearing loss and decided to hit my insurance plan up for some hearing aids. I got a pair for $5000!  They were horrible!  They amped-up everything, and going into a public place, like a restaurant, was like taking a trip to the Tower of Babel!  I literally couldn't converse with someone sitting across the table from me.  I returned those rip-off units and thought about this little guy.  I had left it on a shelf, for a while, because the novelty factor wore off.  Then, I got some ideas.  First, I bought some high-tech Altec ear buds.  They made a big difference.  Then, I decided to deal with the fuzzy microphone.  I opened the unit and disconnected the mike, being sure to leave some of the shielded cable.  I then soldered in a mini phone jack and, after drilling a 15/64&#34; hole into the other side of the unit, I mounted it.  Next, I ordered an Olympus noise rejecting mini mike, from Amazon.  I hooked it up as soon as I got it.  It mounts on a clip that I can clip on my shirt.  Guess what?  This unit is ten times better than the $5000 hearing aids I had purchased (and returned).  I spent about $20 for this unit (it has since gone up), $20 for the ear buds, and $13 for the mike. The mini phone jack was $2.  So, for a grand total of $55, I blew that $5000 rip-off right out of the water, big time!  Don't get taken by the hearing aid &#34;centers&#34; that cater to older folks.  They're mostly middle men dealers who get a piece of every sale they make, from the primary manufacturer, or further-up-the-stream middle men.  They push inferior products at astronomical prices. The unit I have put together will serve me very well.  I only wish that some of the major companies would start making skin-colored ear buds.  Very odd that you can only find one mono (one-bud) unit in &#34;flesh.&#34;  That needs to change, and I'll be pushing for it in an upcoming email campaign.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|First off, $9.99?  Really?  I think I should be paid for having read half of the book-yes it was that bad...I can read most anything.  I can read cookbooks, I can read text books, and I can read boring or unoriginal books.  To me, this book was an effort to write anything that could be perceived as shocking, mix with equal parts redundant and immature prose to equal the next best gimmicky best seller.<br /><br />Second, I would like to purchase a thesaurus for the author.  Mumble, murmurs and oh F#$% are overused to such an extreme that I was shocked.  I searched the words murmur and it was used over 100 times.  I found the repetition cloying and I rolled my eyes over a 100 times.  The constant 'oh f#$%, he's hot' was at odds with her innocent and virginal nature and it struck an off chord for me.  I am a fan of cursing and in proper contexts I find it amusing, but this was like a 12 year old learning that ass is in the dictionary therefore it can be said.<br /><br />Lastly, the plot did not engage me in the least.  I love to read and I don't even care about the supposed controversy that exists around the S&M aspects of the book, but the story itself was underwhelming.  The characters were one dimensional and the conversations she had with her 'inner goddess' annoyed me so badly I wanted to rip my hair out.  Blah blah blah I hated it in its entirety.
0670023329|5.0|Just search for Bukchang and scroll north a bit. Look for the upside-down U-shape in the Taedong River. It makes for spooky perusing after reading the book.<br /><br />What goes on in the camps is sickening, but North Koreans outside the fence are not much better off in terms of standard of living, as the author explains. Once Shin finished \\"school\\" and got a \\"plum\\" assignment working on the livestock ranch where there was ample food to steal, he was better off than the elite folk around Pyongyang because it was during the famine.<br /><br />In one of the world's last remaining \\"worker's paradises,\\" everyone is far from equal. There is a caste system in North Korea.<br /><br />Once Shin escapes, the story becomes *riveting*! He becomes a wide-eyed naif who has never seen money before. By sheer luck and unbeknownst to Shin, his debut in the real-world was perfectly timed and he adapted and blended in with other migrants, enabling his passage to China.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|I loved it when it came on my fone but loved it even more when it came to my kindle!!!

B0073PZIYI|5.0|I was reluctant to view this movie because it seemed a Logan's Run type remake. I was bored so I rented it. I was pleasantly surprised. The premise while having been similar to Logan's Run was an updated version. I really liked it from beginning to end (and if you know me, that's hard to do!). Justin Timberlake did a pretty good job with this. How horrible it would be if our society got to this point. Not having time to buying or stealing time would be a wild concept. I'd reccomend this movie wholeheartedly.
B000KKPN5C|5.0|This is a huge change from the integrated flash to this flash, I was taking pic on a wedding ceremony and the SB400 did the job. I am not a professional photographer but the pic that I took look like a professional. I test some other generic and cost-less flash and believe me., nothing to compare with SB400, this rock !!!

B007PTJOV0|5.0|awesome and leaf clovers are yr lives its really fun my opinion is 1 out of 10 would be 10 really fun
0345803485|3.0|I rarely write reviews, but since I rely on them so frequently I figured I'd throw my opinion out there. This book was an ok read. I kept reading because I was intrigued that the character's would evolve and have a \\"break-through\\" moment, but unfortunately that didn't happen until the end and there was no time to develop from that point. The sex scenes were hot, but I was so annoyed by the repatative verb usage. And nothing annoys me more than when the author mentions the title of the book in the text, over and over. Then again, most people reading erotic novels aren't probably too caught up on verb usage. Not too sure what the craze over this book was. Overall, I say it's a good book to read if you want to branch out from the typical novels you choose.
B005PK1G76|4.0|This product worked great with our b-agile stroller. The stroller folds easily with it on. I recommend this stroller accessory.

0446615625|3.0|I have been reading a lot, since I was a teenager.  And since I got my first Kindle 3 years ago, the obsession has only grown.  Thus, books come up often in conversation, and many a book lover has recommended \\"Baldacci.\\"  One friend loaned me a Baldacci book with the caveat that I must read Camel Club first.  So I went to my Kindle and quickly downloaded \\"Camel Club\\"<br /><br />I could not be more disappointed.  Baldacci wants us to believe that the CIA / FBI and every other government investigative department each have their own secret departments and rogue elements.  And these folks, along with a small group of disenfranchised misfits have never met a conspiracy theory they didn't love.  Each and every character has a John Wayne complex and armed with the truth and the means to achieve their truth they will righteously break any and all laws necessary - Think Ollie North.<br /><br />Then are the other guys who will barter or screw up any and all Governments if the price is right.<br />Once James Fennimore Cooper wrote about happy loner outcasts who quietly, guarded their land and honor.  Baldacci has hundreds of spies and war merchants who want to either bring the world to nuclear holocaust, or not depending on their political views.<br /><br />This book is layer upon layer of dots some connected, some not - Rambos - and suicide bombers.  One wonders why the world is not in flames.  After the first 20% the book does move rather quickly, but none of it is fun or believable.  I would recommend Ken Follet, Jeffrey Archer, Pat Conroy  or Dennis Lehane a thousand times before recommending Baldacci.  And never pass over \\"Destiny of the Republic\\" or \\"The Greater Journey\\" and \\"Brave Companions\\" (just saying)<br />Also, the Kindle offers many great authors for FREE - Austen, Dickens, Cooper, Conan-Doyle - go for any of these.<br />And for kicks: as for me, give me Harry Potter or Twilight!
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|when i was in elementary school i use to play this on the computers.. it was so cool then..i thought i never was gonna find this game again..but i have..its a better game than before..wish the energy didnt run out so quickly..
0439023513|3.0|I've had 24 hours to think about this book and the only thing i'm left with is disappointment.  it wasn't that i didn't like the conclusion.  the conclusion was fine for me: it may not be 'a fairytale' but its as close to one as you can create for  characters who have been through hell and back.  What bothered me was HOW it got there.. that it left something to be desired.  i won't get into too much detail as others on here do already but I felt the book had plenty of good elements to work with & chances to redeem itself and it didn't.  I was trying to put my finger on it and I think what bothered me the most is that the most essential piece of the puzzle: Katniss wasn't given the development she deserved.  Not to mention..how many times can you realistically knock your main character out in a story while major events are occurring before it gets ridiculous?  I think 3 times is one too many and I'm almost certain there were more.  (sigh).  You'll read it because if you read the others, you'll HAVE to finish this one.  It's the main reason I didn't close it and walk away.  I hope the movie offers us a bit more.

B0067QPVJ6|5.0|This is a sequel from the first one that director,  John Carpenter, made  and star's  Kurt Russell. keep in mind you don't really realize it's a sequel until you see what happens at the end  they both go together hand in hand nicly done.  I like this one a lot especially the beginning it catches you by surprise.  The film has a great way of  showing what the Norwegians had to  go through when finding the alien  spacecraft  and before it got out of control and  continued over to the unites states  Antarctic research station . The effects are good and there is some parts that made me jump.  I liked it good entertainment I give it a 5 star now I have both of them in my collection
B00000DFRS|4.0|Whitney's \\"My Love Is Your Love\\" CD is possibly the only full-length studio  release in her catalog (aside from soundtracks like \\"The Bodyguard\\") that can stand the test the time.  The CD has held up remarkably well.  If you play this disc today, you might not tell it was originally released in late 1998 -- 14 years ago.  Full of standout tracks, the CD features soaring ballads such as the excellent Diane Warren-penned \\"I Learned From the Best\\" (where Whit goes all out) and \\"You'll Never Stand Alone\\", (another tailor-made ballad) to Whit's shout-out with her ghetto sisters (Kelly Price and Missy Elliot) in \\"Heartbreak Hotel\\", a raise-the-roof performance where their voices meld beautifully.  \\"Heartbreak Hotel\\" was frustratingly stuck at the #2 position on Billboard's chart for almost two months, blocked ostensibly by the Cher dance-overdub phenomenon known as \\"Believe\\", which topped Billboard for 9 weeks in early 1999 (it earned Cher her very first Grammy a year later).<br /><br />Surprisingly the weak track here is \\"When You Believe\\", Whit's much-hyped duet with Mariah Carey.  It sounds as overly syrupy today as it did 14 years ago; it is awkwardly dated by today's musical tastes.  Carey was reportedly sidelined by a bad case of the flu when they were originally slated to record together (there is still a trace of hoarseness in her vocals), so they ended up singing their tracks separately.  The studio technicians did a great job blending their tracks together later on, but the writing is as sentimental and predictable as you can get (Babyface is a co-writer, need I say more?).  It just shows Houston was still prone to doing sappy material when the occasion called for it.  Perhaps it was to deflect widespread rumors she had a running riff with Carey (as though she needed to care?)<br /><br />The \\"My Love Is Your Love\\" CD is noticeably heavier in its R&B influence than previous Houston recordings, with heavy chunks of reggae and hip hop added, yet Whit sounds remarkably comfortable with the material here.  Clive Davis has done a great job in assembling a list of top songwriters to pen great tracks.  But this was probably a double-edged sword as the CD did not top the Billboard charts, either in the album or singles charts.  With the CD's release, Whit earned some of the best critical raves of her career.  However, the buying public was more hesitant to embrace an album heavy on hip hop and reggae, and not enough of the \\"super ballad\\" stuff a la \\"I Will Always Love You\\" that they wanted from Houston.  Perhaps Whit was at a stage where she was ready to move into newer musical territory, but the public was slow to respond.  Its heavy-R&B influence is reminiscent of her 1990 release \\"I'm Your Baby Tonight\\", which also failed to top the album charts, although the album's title track and \\"All The Man That I Need\\" as singles both topped the Billboard charts.<br /><br />It's too bad the \\"My Love Is Your Love\\" CD did not attain more success than it deserved.  The public still wanted another release in the vein of \\"I Will Always Love You\\" and was not comfortable seeing Whitney stretch into hip hop and reggae.  The CD may have given Whit lots of \\"street cred\\", but it may have alienated some of her old fans.  But give credit to Whitney for sounding fresh and being bold to try new material.  She comes out looking and sounding like the great artist she was capable of.  Regardless of what the buying public thinks, this CD will stand the test of time for years to come.
0553212621|5.0|D.H. Lawrence's once-scandalous tale of a married woman who finds herself through an affair with another man Constance Chatterley is a lovely woman in her mid twenties who is married to Sir Clifford Chatterley, a wealthy British nobleman many years her senior who is paralyzed from the waist down due to an injury sustained during World War I. While Constance loves her husband, she has grown weary of her life as a bird in a gilded cage, as well as her husband's lack of affection. One day, Constance steps out to take a walk and pauses to tell Parkin, the estate's groundskeeper, that the cook would like him to shoot a pheasant for the evening's meal. Constance discovers Parkin is only half-dressed, and the physical strength of his body makes a strong impression on her. Parkin senses Constance's attraction to him, and he's equally taken by her beauty; in time the two throw caution to the wind and give in to their mutual passion. Constance blooms through her lovemaking with Parkin, and she finds his simple, rustic individualism is more to her taste than the life her husband has given her. But as Constance embraces her love for Parkin, others become aware of their relationship. Lady Chatterley was adapted from Lady Chatterley et l'Homme des Bois, the second of three versions Lawrence would publish of his best-known novel (it was published in English as John Thomas and Lady Jane)<br />A real gem.
B007IXWL2C|3.0|I wanted to really like this book and close the Shades.  But it became exhausting.  I wanted the story to hurry up and move along.  After book 1 and 2 and all the sex, I wanted the drama to wrap up.  It seemed like certain scenes were forced.  But thankfully, I was spared every sexual encounter.  We already got the picture several times in the first 2 books; no need to repeat every detail.  I loved the insight into Christian.  It had me wanting to go back and reread parts of book 1.
0060557818|3.0|I thought this book had great potential. I felt the author did pretty well at making his under London city come alive, but I do not think he did much to make  his characters come alive. I didnt get to know door at all. I didnt much care for Richard. I loved the fox and wolf men.  The plot was really good at the beginning and had such great potential... but I was let down. I am glad there was no romance in this.. I every once in a while like to find a book with no romance. It really was over all an okay book, but it could have been so much more!

0394818237|5.0|\\"Busy, Busy Town\\", \\"What Do People Do All Day\\", and \\"Cars and Trucks and Things That Go\\" are pretty much a complete pre-K Library all by themselves. And \\"What Do People Do All Day\\" is a great way for kids to learn about people, jobs, and the world around them.<br /><br />  They are calm and gentle books. The characters are bright, energetic and cheerful. The stories are about activity, sharing, doing things, working and playing. The jokes are just right for little ones. There is no irony or condescension in the art or in the writing.<br /><br />  You know how people would make fun of Mr. Rogers, but moms and dads came to appreciate his calm, gentle and supportive influence. Well, that's sort of the feeling you get from Scarry's work. No showboating; no post-modern take; no grim in-your-face shots. Just energy and gracefulness. Lowly Worm is a fun little guy. Huckle is a solid kid. Adults are responsible and trustworthy. Things are neat and cool and exciting and fun, and sometimes a little silly.<br /><br />  Now, you probably don't really want a full time diet of Scarry, and edgy or zany or frantic can be fun in the mix too, but day in and day out and generation after generation, these books are solid. (And you know what? The Scarry VHS tapes and DVD's are as mellow as the books, and just seem to fascinate the kids.)

B002BCNK1Q|4.0|One of Clint Eastwood's BEST films, and his least politically-correct (PC) film.  I think there's a correlation.  Another film he did (Letters from Iwo Jima) had its impact & quality definitely damaged by trying to be too PC.  In Gran Torino, Eastwood plays Walt, an old curmugeonly Korean War Vet who's about as least PC as any character I've witnessed in the movies.  He is definitely Old School, he is a retired auto worker, he jokes and curses a lot and he calls everybody by ethnic slurs.  He is growing old and he doesn't fit in with today's society any more.  He is estranged from his yuppie Son's family (his Son sells Toyotas and lives in the suburbs, and his Grandaughter is quite spoiled).  He packs an old 45 handgun to keep himself safe, well, because he lives in Detroit.  Walt's neighborhood is changing into Hmong immigrants and although Walt has quite the initial prejudice against them, he slowly starts accepting them after befriending neighbor Thao (a 18-ish Hmong boy, who initially tried to steal Walt's car after being pressured by a gang but then works for Walt to make up for it).  So Walt gradually feels more attached to his Hmong neighbor children than he does to his own family, and he gets pulled into their lives.  A big part of their lives is avoiding Hmong gangs, and Walt ends up being embroiled in their fight with the local gang.<br /><br />This film works on many levels.  It works on a dramatic level as the viewer identifies with Walt and becomes enmeshed in his life's struggles, as well as Thao's and Thao's sister.  It works on an emotional level as Walt brings out his past demons (from the war) and connects with Thao as if he were his own son.  It also works on a symbolic level, as Walt, the old white American, is slowly going downhill, as he sees his world changing around him, with some good (Asians working hard to rise out of poverty, become doctors etc), some bad (his complacent Son and bratty Granddaughter) and some appalling (Asian, Black and Latino gangs prowling Detroit's mean streets and fomenting violence).  And finally, it works on an acting level, as Eastwood plays a really good cranky old curmugeon!  (BTW Eastwood's son plays a pretty effective bit part as a local white kid trying to act cool in order to escape violence from some local street thugs.)<br /><br />It's yet another in a line of vigilante movies, but more human and involved than, say, Death Wish, and with a powerful dramatic twist at the end.  Being non-PC, it is very effective and does not pull punches.  But it is artistic as well -- the theme song played at the end, written by Eastwood & performed by Jamie Cullem is haunting and beautiful.  I give it only 4 stars because 5 star awards should be rare!
B0018QQQK8|2.0|Nicholas Sparks is one of my favorite writers. He has written heart warming and \\"unique\\" stories...except for \\"The Lucky One\\". It felt like Deja Vu and then I remembered a Hallmark Original movie I saw a couple of years ago called \\"The Christmas Card\\". Hmm....

B005WFWVL4|5.0|In this age of electronic Hand Sanitizer dispensers, Clorox wipes and Latex Gloves, it doesn't take long to get scared while watching this movie. I'll admit I am a bit OCD about hand washing and buying Clorox wipes. Naturally this movie had me scared for weeks afterwards. It chronicles a pandemic with a virus that can be spred both by touching things and someone coughing. Many of our best actors play characters from all over the globe, and all are tested with choosing the high road or the low road. Soderbergh stuns as usual, with a tight story line and smart editing. The actors are amazing, but the real star is obviously the illness.

B000K7MMP4|3.0|The acting is good here, especially that of the actress playing Lizzy Bennett, but in general suffers in comparison with the 1995 BBC production. That may be a very high bar! But it makes this version pale in comparison. And I don't agree that the adaptation is more faithful than other versions...not because it lacks in verbatim quotes, but for other reasons cited below.<br /><br />When watching this, I cannot help but think it seems \\"staged\\" next to the naturalistic transitions in the Simon Langton version. That is exactly what was remarkable about the 1995 version...the pacing of the  pauses between the exchanges, which might in other conversations seem overlong, but here are perfect. The  non verbal responses that surround the dialogue give life to the words in a manner that is exactly what I imagine when I read the book.<br /><br />This adaptation has too many characters speaking with the social insights that Austen herself voiced as the \\"narrator\\". Thus, while the lines are faithful to the book, the teleplay does a disservice to the integrity of the personalities that Austen crafted so consistently in the book. In contrast, Andrew Davies 1995 script is faithful to both Austen's commentary AND her characters.

0307352145|5.0|This was a much awaited read for me.  I love books, I like peace and quiet and I score pretty highly on introversion too.  I watched Susan Cain's TED talk and went straight over to download the kindle version..... I wasn't disappointed.    My best bits?  Her style, which is intimate, easy to read yet packed full of enough science to persuade the sceptical.  The depth - this is what Susan herself calls her life's work - and it shows, this is not a skim of the surface of introversion, it has oceans of breadth and depth.    I loved the description of Cain attending a Tony Robbins event and her thoughts on how to help introvert children manage in a extrovert world were well thought out and sensitively delivered.    In short, a well researched, well written look at why sometimes it pays to listen to the quieter voices in the room.  To read more of my post read musings, visit the @sponge blog [...]
1597801585|4.0|I had difficulty getting involved with the story (the details of location, the characters, even the time period being covered seemed too sparsely explained so I initially struggled to follow what was going on), but by the time the story drew to a close I was hoping against hope there was already a sequel out there (or at least in the works).<br /><br />Well worth reading.
B000002KOY|4.0|Got this cd after seeing it listed in mojo magazine's 100 best 'lost' albums. alot of great tracks here : gone dead train is a track with a stones-sy swag, look at all the things and i don't wanna talk about it showcase the late danny whitten's much-missed songwriting and singing talents. dance, dance, dance-has a cool blue-grassy feel with some fiddle to boot. 'downtown' is danny whitten's paen to copping dope (in retrospect, it serves as a cautionary reminder of the consequence of abusing hard drugs. whitten fatally od'ed about a year later)

B002MQYOFW|5.0|I found the characters honest, tough, and defiant given they lived in \\"Districts\\" with various hardships.  The Hunger Games were a yearly event where two \\"tributes\\" were chosen in a fight-to-the-death contest that was televised for all of Panem to watch.  I consumed this book and found I couldn't stop turning pages and reading more.  While it was a little disturbing, I think one has to look to the bigger warning of a society grown cruel and sadistic so easily.  Read this and you won't be sorry.

0307592731|5.0|This book is not just a reminiscence of a long-distance backpacking trip. I have been a backpacker for 40 years, but never had time or inclination to try one of those thousand or more mile treks like the one Cheryl did over 20 years ago. But my interest in backpacking led me to the book. It is a stupendous read. It describes eloquently what I have found to be true about \\"hitting trail\\" with your house on your back, whether it is for a few days or for months: First there is the adventure of it. Some of that adventure comes from making mistakes and this author made plenty. But getting out into the wild places is going to be an adventure even if you make no mistakes. And that is doubly true if you dare to go alone (dangerous, and not recommended, of course). Then there is the unadorned pride at doing something physically and mentally challenging. And of course there are those many flashes of beauty and majesty you get when you are out for a good trek into real wilderness. This author conveys all of that with a grace and style that will keep you reading, even if you have no intention to backpack or step into a wilderness. But she also goes beyond all of the above. She manages to tell her story of personal transformation that occurred during that summer of backpacking the PCT. Her transformation is one that will be of great interest to many other women, but men will be moved by it too. Read this book. Then go find your own wilderness to experience and maybe end up being transformed, as Cheryl was. To me this was a great spiritual book, written by a gifted artist, with a life story that will bring joy and maybe a little pain to most readers.

014312093X|5.0|Having recently watched the fine 2011 motion picture of the book, I decided to re-read LeCarre's cold war classic and it did not disappoint. The basic premise is that a mole has burrowed his way into the British Circus at the highest level. Such is the level of corruption that everyone who is right about the threat is determined wrong and removed from his or her post. George Smiley, Control's right hand man, is put out to early retirement. But, when it becomes apparent that the ministry needs to investigate the matter, whom do you get to spy on the spies? Only Smilely will do.<br /><br />LeCarre's great gift in writing is that the prose is as deliberate as Smiley is in one's mind. Still, Smiley is an unforgetable character in that mentally he is three steps ahead of everyone else, save Karla, his mirror-image in the USSR. As Smiley goes about unearthing the truth, charaacters are fully developed and the denouncement is very satisfactory.

0143119680|2.0|I rarely give up on a book once I start it, but I got exactly 62% of the way through this one (according to my Kindle) before I had to say \\"Life is too short.\\"<br /><br />Like many other reviewers, I enjoy fantasy fiction and wanted to like this book. And to be fair, there are a handful of wonderfully written sentences in it, and the author clearly spent a lot of time designing her world. But that's as much praise as I can give it.<br /><br />Most of what the other less-than-4-stars reviewers have said about this book is spot-on, but here are my personal pet peeves:<br /><br />Diana, our main character, is an absolutely shameless Mary Sue: a beautiful, brilliant, yoga-running-rowing goddess that all the men want. Then she finds out she's also a superwitch, the most powerful of her generation, etc. Yet she is also incredibly modest and unassuming. So how do we know how fabulous she is? Through all the unrealistic dialogue between her and the people in her life, of course. \\"You just don't know how beautiful you are, do you, Diana?\\" says more than one man. Her colleagues tell her how brilliant she is. Daemons gush over her potential. Even her aunts get into the act, reminding her of her amazing powers and famous family. And on and on. Enough already!<br /><br />Matthew, our vampire, is a classic cookie-cutter romance hero: outrageously handsome, tall, totally buff, erudite and brilliant, richer than Croesus, dominant, and has been savin' all his love for Diana -- even though he's like, fifteen hundred years old, not to mention French. He is presented as SUPER DANGEROUS in the beginning...but then we find out he \\"hunts\\" bunnies, not people. He has reputation for misogyny (seriously! it's in the book!) is \\"used to getting his way\\"...yet he shows no trace of the abusive tendencies typical of control-freaks. Basically he's just another angsty vampire de-demonized so that a good girl can fall in love with him...though I am unsure exactly why Diana does, since he also has no discernible personality whatsoever.<br /><br />The author goes to great lengths to depict Diana as very modern, independent, and headstrong...so naturally she lets Matthew be the boss of her at every turn. It goes like this: He says \\"Jump,\\" she waves pale, \\"fragile\\" fists of resistance, then (briefly) feigns reluctance as she says \\"How high?\\" It's an obvious surrender fantasy, and there's nothing wrong with that unless the author tries to hide it with lame protestations and rationalizations. Seriously, those went out with 70's bodice rippers.<br /><br />But you know, despite all this, I still might have finished the book if it weren't for the pages and pages and PAAAAGES of descriptions of totally irrelevant things like drinking wine, eating food, yoga, and horseback riding. The author seems to equate \\"the telling detail\\" with \\"telling every detail.\\" After one particularly soporific chapter, I just couldn't do it any more. (Note: If you are a foodie, you might enjoy this book as the wine in it has more depth and nuance than the characters.)discernible personality whatsoever.<br /><br />The author goes to great lengths to depict Diana as very modern, independent, and headstrong...so naturally she lets Matthew be the boss of her at every turn.

1451627289|2.0|No one can take away the fact that Stephen King is an incredible horror writer and has been so for a very long time. He will be remembered as one of the greats. Some of the most fascinating novels / movies of our time have come from his twisted little head....However....11/22/63 is a journey into new ground for King and one that I wish he would have just ventured away from.<br />I am a \\"Presidential History buff\\" and have actually visited Dallas and seen all of these places that have marked history since 1963, so I was very excited to hear that King was going to base a book on this subject. It is apparent that King has a fascination with these events as well. So finally, I thought, a great writer is going to tackle on a several subjects that I love. The Kennedy Assassination and Time Travel. This book ought to be great! I was wrong. It's not great, it's not even good. It's not even close to what a time travel book should be let alone one of this significance. It is an 800 plus page book that doesn't even \\"get\\" to Dallas (let alone Oswald) till well over half way through the book. This story has some many side-stories and excuses to NOT touch on the major story line. I can honestly say that I will NEVER read another story by King again and have donated the book to a \\"book-trade\\" in my complex. THIS BOOK IS A WASTE OF TIME for anyone who has a desire to read a great time travel story. This is a story that we have always dreamed of reading and story that should have been told better.<br />I hear Jonathan Demme (of Silence of the Lambs fame) may direct this as a movie! One can only hope Demme does to this book what Stanley Kubrick did to THE SHINING! One can hope.<br />In-Any-Event: If you love history and time travel...THIS IS NOT THE BOOK FOR YOU. If you loved Mr. Holland's Opus and Titanic, than maybe you should buy this book. I would give you my copy but maybe someone in my complex is using it as a door-stop. In that way it would serve them better than it did me.

B0053YGYO4|3.0|Coldplay is transforming to more of a pop band than an experimental. So this album is not the Coldplay we want to have, it even has rihanna in it. Coldplay needs to go back to the olden days before it is too late. Buy this if you are not a Coldplay fan, if you are, you are better of not buying it. I have it and it is okay, but not good enough.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I bought this trilogy from the Kindle store.  Great books, great story.  Enjoyed the books and the Kindle edition.  Very good deal to buy all three at once.
B0067R0APK|4.0|I love the lay out of this weather app, it was the paid version was worth it for me to remove the ads.
B0077SGMXM|5.0|Game is a lot of fun and kept me busy for a few hours playing it. give it a shot.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|I love the trilogy,if you loved Twilight, you will love this-albeit a very adult version of their love.You will fall in love/lust with Christian Grey and his love for Anastasia Steele.You will want to finish the whole trilogy-but I have to say that my kindle version came with so many mistakes it was unnerving. There were times where it seemed that a letter was missing from a word because otherwise the line didn't make sense,there were times where there was an extra pronoun in the sentences,did anyone proofread them before they published it?
B007MNV5WU|4.0|As in previous Angry Bird games, this one is addictive as well.  I gave it 4 out of 5 stars because the version I downloaded for the Kindle Fire for less than three bucks, had only 3 planets with about 10 levels to each.  Plus a 3 golden egg bonus level.  I was dissapointed it wasn't a longer game, but was happy with the game itself.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|Plays well on Kindle Fire! I recommend this for everyone. Don't usually play these games but couldn't resist trying it. Thank You!

B005MMJ84K|4.0|After stumbling upon Delirium last year, and thoroughly enjoying its original plot line, I could not wait until Pandemonium came out to see what became of Lena and Alex.  When I set down to read Pandemonium, the first thing that I noticed was the time frame changes.  While I like the fact that the time changes were labeled, and did not change mid chapter, I still found myself struggling to keep up with what time frame I was in.  I found myself having to stop and gather my thoughts before I could continue.  I realize that the author had a reason for doing this, to show that everything that Lena had gone through had led her to this point, and will help her make it through, but I felt as if it took away from the story.<br />Another aspect that I noticed was the fact that after such a traumatic and action packed ending to Delirium, that Pandemonium started off kind of slow.  I struggled to get into the book unlike Delirium.  Pandemonium starts off slow, but goes out with a bang (and maybe a little bit of a shock).<br /><br />The \\"now\\" part of the story had an urgent feel to it, but with the filler \\"then\\" chapters in between, I felt like the urgency that Oliver wanted us to feel was taken down a notch.  The \\"then\\" chapters explains how Lena has moved on after Delirium, and has become a valuable asset to the Resistance, but at times these sections are very slow, and broken up.<br /><br />I am not trying to say that this book is a disappointment, far from it.  This book is definitely not a let down like so many follow ups are.  After spending most of Delirium as an innocent young lady who slowly finds herself immersed in a rebellion, Lena develops into a strong and fierce woman who knows what she has to do.  Lena no longer relies purely on the protection of others; Lena is now the one who does the saving.  She is no longer worried about what will become of everyone she loves if she chooses the wrong path, Lena has made her decision and while she struggles to come to termswith it at times, she continues to fight on because that is what she believes is right.<br />Many other characters are introduced in Pandemonium, some playing a larger role in the plot line than others.  Raven is a central character who tries to hide the fact that she is just as scared as everyone else by hiding behind her tough exterior.  Raven is the backbone of their little group, and without her pushing the group never would have made it.<br />Julian is introduced pretty early in the book and is described as a handsome young man.  He reminded me of Lena in the first book; confused and angry, and has to be led by the hand through the dark until he can come to terms with what he has learned.  He starts off as a weak and frustrating character, and eventually develops into a likeable character.<br /><br />Overall this book was very well written, as most have seen in Oliver's other works.  She is descriptive enough that the audience can visualize the world in our heads while reading, but not overly descriptive to the point it is annoying.  Oliver has a way about her writing that allows the reader to feel what the characters are feeling, such as pain and anger, a prevalent emotion in this book.  While the breaking up of the chapters takes the overall urgent tone of the novel down a few notches, the urgency is still there; the reader can feel it in the end when everything that has happened in the book so far comes to a head.<br />After reading Pandemonium and seeing the plot line develop with its twists and turns, all I can say is that I am extremely excited for the next book in the series because I cannot wait to see where Oliver is going to take us next.
0646497855|5.0|It is a really nice book; however, you should learn on daily basis with the hard working. When you learn new things you must remember each and every thing learn again and again with target Band 7
B005ZMTYTQ|3.0|*Possible Spoilers*<br />After reading I Am Number Four by Pittacus Lore, I was really looking forward to seeing I Am Number Four in theaters.  After watching the movie I was disappointed that they had chopped up the book and turned it into this movie.  Important parts that are found in the book are taken out of the movie; I realize that this has to happen due to time restraints, but they added in parts that never happened in the book.  I also felt like a lot of the background information that I felt was important to the understanding of the story was left out or glossed over; the development of his legacies, and the time he spent with Henri was all missing.  The two main characters fell for each other rather quickly in my opinion; they never really had time to get to know one another let alone fall in love.  Also, the \\"Mogs\\" were not as scary as I had envisioned them, which was a let down seeing as they are here to destroy the earth, not simply scare a few humans.<br /><br />I think that if I had not read the book I would not have been as disappointed.  The movie was fast paced and the characters were likeable for the most part.  The special effects and CGI were really well done with a few exceptions.  Towards the middle of the movie once Number Six arrives, the action really started to pick up and the movie became much more interesting and kept my attention.  Number Six kicks butt while John sits back and tries to protect his love interest.  Looks wise, I liked who they cast for the main characters; Alex Pettyfer and Dianna Agron fit who I had imagined while reading the book.<br /><br />Overall this movie was decent, especially if you have not read the books.  If you have read the books, do not expect an accurate translation from book to screen, but based on past experiences, we can never expect an accurate translation.  Check it out if you have some time to spare and are into Sci-fy, action, types of movies.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|I think that the game lep's world is really fun and kind of challenging. I think that everyone. could play this game and it would be fun for them to play. I just got this tame and I was playing and having so much fun with the game lep's world.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|The game pretty much is a rip off of mario. I love it though, tons of fun to play and a great time waster. Controlls are great and the graphics are colorful and pleasing to look at.
B007PT3QOQ|1.0|It looked like a great game at first. Kind of like some of the games I have played on facebook. I read the reviews and saw that you had to pay for extra energy, I thought o well I will play once a day and let my energy charge through-out the day. It does not work that way, your energy only fills up while the game is on! So you can use all your energy,  let the game sit overnight,  and in the morning you will still have 0 energy. I am deleting this game.

B004KSQN7C|5.0|Femme Fatale is Britney's best album to date.  I have heard this album countless times and its always such a fun cd to sing along and dance to! Britney doesnt pretend to be some serious artist and she sticks to what she does best -- dance/pop music!  This CD is a cohesive masterpiece from start to finish. My personal favorites: Hold it Against Me, I Wanna Go, Up and Down, Trouble for Me.

B002SSUQFG|5.0|I was in the market for a nice mechanical/automatic that I could wear as my casual watch. After looking around and getting advice at /r/malefashionadvice, I decided that a Seiko 5 would do it for me.<br /><br />So far my SNK809 has withstood my day to day and kept on ticking, literally. It's very soothing to put the watch up to your ear and hear the mechanisms going to work - tick, tick, tick. The face is very attractive and easy to read in all light. I find the layout very intuitive and it takes less than a day to adjust to the - hour on the inside, minute on the outside - styling.<br /><br />My one gripe is that the stock band is a little bulky for my taste. I was expecting a low profile NATO style. But it wasn't quite there. So, I picked up a Corvus Bond NATO and now it is perfect. I didn't take any stars off for this because it is just my opinion and I'm sure many people would be very happy with the stock band.
B006FE83U4|5.0|This movie is a classic and a must-see!  A great story that delivers a powerful message of truth, tolerance and integrity.  The 50th anniversary edition special features are a wonderful bonus.  This item was received very promptly after it was ordered.  It is a wonderful addition to any Blu-Ray collection.

1930485182|5.0|I checked this out from the public library a couple of months ago... and decided I just had to have my own copy.  This book truly is a keeper for any woman post menarche and pre-menopause.<br /><br />The book focuses on the impact of yoga on the menstrual cycle.  It begins with an introduction to that very cycle, a history of views upon it, and just how various medicinal views approach the subject before delving into the power of yoga.  In fact, the book is organized and color-coded for specific cycle situations.<br /><br />As for the skill level, this the type of book that is accessible to all yogis novice and beyond.  Each pose is presented with a variety of modifications... one can certainly find the appropriate version.<br /><br />Best of all, this is one of those books that masters the art of pictures.  The pictures are clear, follow an idiot-proof step-by-step approach, and when combined with specific wording make it easy to get the pose down.<br /><br />This is currently my favorite yoga book, and I anticipate it being a favorite for quite a while.

It's been a total eye-opening experience.<br />Now I am able to identify UAWs and PAWs all around me, including myself. Without a doubt I myself have been a UAW, although after reading this book, highly motivated<br />to become a PAW.
1582701709|3.0|The book, the audio, and the DVD are all exactly the same.  A little inspirational, but I was disappointed to discover that story isn't of a subject's personal experience.  It's a collection of motivational speakers giving you insight on the laws of attraction.
B002UJIY70|3.0|First, I have to unload here. My Brother was U.S.Army Special Forces. He NEVER bragged about his skills or the battles he fought in Viet Nam. Neither has any other veteran of any other war I have met.  Calling oneself an American Jedi sounds a bit phony to me. That being said, that statement was part of character development. I bought this movie because I like Milla Jovovitch and for once she does a creditable job. Her character and her hubby's character are on honey moon in Hawaii. Lots of fun.  But all is not as it seems in Paradise. Our Heroes stop for a hitchhiking couple but change their mind when they appear to be dangerous. Our Heroes reach the trail head and start hiking. Hearing of murders on Oahu many hikers turn back. But not Our Heroes. They meet a Lovely Couple and decide to spend time at the falls before continuing. Would you believe it? The Dangerous Couple they refused a ride to are also in the area. Uh oh, what are they doing here? Our Heroes and Lovely Couple continue to the beach. Stopping at a river crossing Our Heroes pretend a pee break, mostly so Cliff can get a cell phone connection and get the news. We are led to believe that their new friends are culprits. That thought vanishes when Jedi quotes a line from a movie that Screen Writer Cliff doesn't recognize. Uh oh, now what? Some comical tracking through a bamboo jungle and a rainy campout later they arrive at the beach. OK. Are you ready? Everyone tries to kill everyone else and the bystanders suffer.  That's all I will give away. There is a LOT of beautiful scenery shown. I like this movie. \\"Keep shaking that bush Luke.\\" (From the movie Cool Hand Luke).
B0052U59F4|5.0|Wow. Steamy book that sheds some light on an alternative lifestyle. If you are squeamish about a little graphic sex - do not read this book. Did not care for the ending of the series. The excerpt at the end of book three would make a great prequel.
B004QK5N5W|3.0|This is nice.  It works well with the iPad 2, but I could not get it to work with the iPad 1.  I am trying to steam Netflix to the TV.  Also, the resolution isn't the best, but it's not a bad option to use this for streaming movies to your TV when on a budget!
0374275637|5.0|This is a terrific book, and if you don`t know the topic-- buy it and read it. The author does try to popularize the language, but imho it doesn`t go far enough. It really is a book about how context and signs and symbols and language hypnotize the human mind, without it even being aware of it.<br />If you ever engaged in hypnosis (which I have, moderately well), or written and published engrossing fiction (ditto), then you`d be able to say what the author says even more simply. Otherwise, buy and read the book.<br />BTW, the other people who use this knowledge are the so called Pick Up Artists-- PUA`s-- who use the power of suggestion and mild trance-induction in order to suggest intriguing erotic possibilities to the female mind, while using the overriding context of safety and attraction. Certain security services use similar methods in teaching their `Romeo`s`and `Swallows`to lay a `honeytrap,`which, contrary to popular belief, relies more on psychological attraction and the power of giving attention, than on physical sex appeal. In fact, you may be surprised at the less than overwhelming appearance of some of the most successful clandestine seducers, all of whom have perfected the arts of which Dr. Kahnemann speaks. But I digress. Buy this book and read it, then go read a good book about hypnosis, and some of the Samizdat literature by PUA`s. You may be surprised at the similarities.<br />EOM.

1400069289|4.0|The stated purpose of The Power of Habit is to explain how habits work and, hopefully when armed with this information, the reader will be able to devise methods to go about changing their habits for good.  Along the way New York Times investigative reporter Charles Duhigg takes the reader on an informative, lively tour of personal, organizational and societal habits.<br /><br />Clearly based on extensive research and interviews (check the 60 pages of Notes for confirmation), Duhigg has taken a small idea from a Major fighting in Iraq who quelled rioting in the city of Kufa by simply keeping food vendors away from growing mobs and turned it into an extensive narrative on how habits work, how we create new ones and how we can change them.<br /><br />In this regard Duhigg shines.  In the habits of individuals section we learn about the three-step \\"habit loop\\" and how our brain looks for ways to save effort by first looking for \\"cues\\" or triggers, followed by a \\"routine\\" to follow that is physical, mental or emotional and finally a \\"reward\\" that determines if the loop is memorable enough to become a habit.  Duhigg does a fine job of explaining habits, how they work and indeed how to change them.<br /><br />Like many bestsellers based on social science research (Willpower by Baumeister and Tierney, Redirect by Tim Wilson and Change Anything by Kerry Patterson for example) Duhigg tells great stories, many with a surprising twist that engages the reader and seem to further his argument.  However, at times he seems to overreach in estimating the power of habits and gives them credit for everything from Super Bowl victories, the amazing turnaround of Fortune 500 companies and the gains of the Civil Rights Movement.<br /><br />While Tony Dungy as coach of the Indianapolis Colts, Paul O'Neill at Alcoa and Rosa Parks and the Montgomery Bus Boycott make for amazing stories in Duhigg's capable hands, to attribute their successes to habits and habits alone seems to make the error that Phil Rosenzweig highlights in his seminal work The Halo Effect.<br /><br />Could having a Hall of Fame quarterback at the most important position in sports have helped Dungy's team as much, if not more than, simple habit change?  Did rising aluminum prices in the late 1980's and 1990's account for some, if not most, of Alcoa's financial success beyond O'Neill's focus on worker safety?  And after years and years of struggle before 1955 did the Civil Rights Movement finally reach its tipping point in Montgomery?<br /><br />Make no mistake, Duhigg is very persuasive with these and many more stories, but beyond his explanation of habit formation and change and especially his own habit change process found in the Appendix (which I found very helpful), I feel he used his habit model as a hammer and every story he tells was a nail.<br /><br />I still highly recommend this book, but beyond studies that were independently verified and research based more on causation than correlation, I would take some of Duhigg's stories with a grain of salt.  For the reader looking to change personal habits however I can think of no better place to start.that Phil Rosenzweig highlights in his seminal work The Halo Effect.<br /><br />Could having a Hall of Fame quarterback at the most important position in sports have helped Dungy's team as much, if not more than, simple habit change?

B005MYWZIO|5.0|Michael Kiwanuka is a young British singer/songwriter who has gotten a lot of buzz in recent years for a number of limited release eps featuring his stripped down and throw back style. Now that his first long player \\"Home Again\\" has been released onto the masses, the question is does he live up to the buzz or are we victims of the hype?  I would say \\"Home Again\\" lives up to the buzz. Home Again is a compact 38 minutes; short by today's standards of overly-filled releases but just right for the project.  Home Again brings together most of the tracks from the 3 eps released between 2010 and 2011 and adds a clutch of new songs to the mix. Together they blend into a cohesive statement that merges together folk, soul, pop and jazz stylings to create something that leaves a lasting impression. Great care was taken to produce a vintage sound which would make you think you've stepped back to 1972 where on am radio you were could hear the likes of Al Green, James Taylor, Bill Withers, Roberta Flack,and Joni Mitchell, all in the same format. However upon repeated and close listening, you will notice the great care and subtlety embedded throughout the album. What at first appears as light, easy listening unfolds to be something filled with soul, heart and emotion. The songs go from lush to sparse, and each track is imbued with unique touches such a small violin section, or a male quartet, or a mandolin solo. The production is super clean and brings Michael's reedy and plaintive voice straight to the center and captures his essence very nicely. All songs work together to create a cohesive musical statement -- by album's end you really have a sense of Kiwanuka's artistic perspective and what he stands for musically. Home Again is overall very mellow - and can be great background music or just as effective as salve for the heart and for listening to in the quiet hours when the heart is troubled.  All and all I am well pleased and look forward to his career.

B007QRWXJG|5.0|I don't have a TV anymore and didn't realize the episodes would be here on Amazon. It is scary easy to buy them and very cool to be able to easily watch over and over. $1.99 can add up if I buy them all but it's worth the thrill. So excited to have these at my fingertips!
B003O86FMW|5.0|Action, Killing, Plot Twists, Addictive Read, what more do you want in a sequel? Sequels tend to fall short of their predecessors but I found this one to be a compelling quick read.  Yes you don't get to know all the tributes that well but we didn't know all of them in the first Hunger Games.  The ones you do get to know are easily remembered.  There's plenty of action and plot twists to really keep you flipping pages.  I was so shocked by the ending that I had to buy three and start it the same night.  It was a fantastic read with lots of surprises.  People who expect happiness and roses should not have read this trilogy to begin with.  The complaints seem to be the same about this book and yet I find the majority of people rate it 3-5.  This is not a series for people who want a happy ending which I admit I typically do, until reading these, I've grown to expect sadness and death.  These things are typical of dystopian novels.<br /><br />Excellent addition to the series.  I read this faster than either of the other books.  It was fast paced and entertaining.

B005FITIGO|5.0|\\"Margin Call\\" is a drama film that examines a 36-hour period of time in a fictional New York investment bank during the lead up to the 2008 Global Financial Crisis.<br /><br />The narrative gives particular attention to individual employees in the investment bank who face questions of morality when it becomes apparent that they are staring at a major financial collapse. But they have the advantage of acting before the rest of the market gets wind of the situation if they choose to. Subsequently, resolutions are considered which are self-interested and that will leave a tidal wave of destruction, yet resistance to surviving at the expense of other firms and investors faces the monumental barrier of greed.<br /><br />The film characters represent a variety of philosophies with the pitiless on one side and those that follow moral principles on the other. Both sides and those in the middle collide in a tense tug of war over varying perspectives of what is the right action to take.<br /><br />With a superb film cast and a well crafted story that covers the viewpoint of those whose hands control the financial future of the world, the viewer is treated to an enthralling movie.<br /><br />Nicholas R.W.

B0073Q0DZG|5.0|I loved this! I love all the birding references and the accuracy--right down to looking for Tamaulipas Crows at the Brownsville dump. Black, Martin and Wilson are great. I've been birding for only several years now, but I always thought that the obsessive nature of the hobby would make for some good comedy--and this movie didn't disappoint. I also enjoyed seeing the way the characters (especially Jack Black's) try to manage their working lives around their birding. My only regret is that I rented it. I should've just bought the DVD!
0823004325|5.0|I love this book! It offers very thorough explanations of the mechanics of facial expressions, starting with the basics of bone structure and proportion and going into muscle placement and the instinctive connection of specific facial muscles to certain emotions, differing levels of emotion, etc. There are side-by-side illustrations to help differentiate some of the finer points. I've found it really helpful in my sculptural work as well as two-dimensional art. Just a great book!
B0071WQ7WU|3.0|Shinedown fans are a mixed lot. For every fan that will point to the hard rockin' songs off of _The Sound of Madness_ like \\"Devour\\" and \\"Cyanide Sweet Tooth Suicide\\" as representative of the band's sound, another will point to tunes like \\"I Dare You\\" and \\"Save Me\\" from _Us & Them_ as the band's finest. Because of Shinedown's diverse musical talent and shifting style, no one album will ever make all fans completely happy.<br /><br />The problem with _Amaryllis_ goes beyond that, however, and is two fold: 1) most of the songs don't sound particularly unique and 2) none of the songs significantly stand out. Case in point: the album opens with the high-energy anthem \\"Adrenaline\\" - a song fans will instantly compare to the far superior high-energy anthem \\"Devour\\" that opened the last album. Yes, \\"Adrenaline\\" has its moments (and is probably already being licensed for use in advertisements and stadiums everywhere), but it is just so much vanilla that blends in with similar high energy songs that have been produced over the years, and has nothing particular to set it apart. Then there is \\"Amaryllis,\\" the title track, that will remind many listeners of other songs within the first ten seconds. It continues on like that throughout the album with the exception of \\"Bully\\" - an instrumentally strong song that has been criticized for weak lyrics (the intro for \\"Bully,\\" by the way, definitely sounds like it was inspired by Zak Wylde).<br /><br />Rating: 3 forgettable stars. I already feel ready to pull it from my playlist, and I've barely had it for a week.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|We have watched season one and two at least 3 times each. Wonderful British acting depicted a tumultousness time in British society. Every character had a personal story of great interest. All characters were developed artistically but with sympathy and care. We highly recommend every episode.
B005PW3OS8|4.0|Overall great movie. Some decent action and a good message - if you care about that sort of thing.<br /><br />The downside was that the streaming quality from Amazon was garbage and has been on just about everything we've watched from them. This may or may not be an issue for you.
0446547603|5.0|First off, and this might not be the best reason to buy a book, but honestly, I love this cover! So I picked it up at a book fair and found I loved the story inside even more. Sparks tells the story from all the main characters perspectives one chapter at a time. It keeps it fresh and allows us to see what is going on in the crazy husbands head, which is frightening to read, but I'm sure was more frightening to write. This book was a little more on the suspenseful side, but still had plenty of romantic tension to keep me interested. Once again, the master delivers another great read.
B000RLFJQ2|3.0|Man, was this tedious. No real character development, and the pacing was maddeningly slow. Don't waste your time. The Conversation, The French Connection are both better examples of film noir - which I gather this was trying to be. Reservoir Dogs, anything by Tarantino, early DeNiro - Mean Streets, Taxi Driver. Not this one, unfortunately.
1596912863|5.0|Shannon Hale does it again! I have loved her YA novels and display several of them on my library shelf. Being a huge Jane Austen fan myself, I was happy to add this to the bunch. A romantic comedy that obviously doesn't take itself too seriously I found it laugh out loud funny! Maybe it's because I share in this Colin Firth obsession, but from the first dedication (Colin Firth, let's just be friends), to the end I couldn't put it down. And when I finally did, I wanted to go put on my very used 6 hour dvd collection of Pride and Prejudice staring Colin Firth. This story was just what I needed. If you need something light, entertaining, and romantic in a not too risque way, pick this book up.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|this game is a blast. reminds me of super Mario bros for leps . :) I would definitely suggest this game to friends.
1455508977|5.0|I love a love story. And in my opinion, Nicholas Sparks is one of the best love story tellers. In, The lucky One, Sparks tells it from the guys perspective, and I love that! I also enjoyed the army experience back story. I have to admit that Zac Efron wasn't exactly who I had in mind, but, wow! Lucky one indeed! I can't wait to see this movie, because this was one of my favorite stories by Sparks to date. Great job once again!
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|this could b more fun if u didnt run out of energy so quickly. is enjoyable though. i think i will keep this one for a bit

B0052YAKS6|5.0|I ordered the CD and got it pretty fast. If you like the kind of music Guetta produces you won't make anything wrong buying this CD. The only thing I would have preferred, as it is the explicit version, that the Snoop Dogg remix could have been \\"Wet\\". But apart from that, I like the CD.

0525421033|4.0|If I Stay is one of those books that came to my attention after I started reading YA book blogs. Everyone raved about it and author Gayle Forman. So when I found it at my local library, I was excited to give it a whirl. I'm glad I did. I think If I Stay is a book everyone ought to experience.<br /><br />First off, I was so surprised at what a short book it is. My edition is just shy of 200 pages! What a nice change after reading some rather hefty reads (400+ pages) recently. But do not underestimate the strength of the book based on it's length. It is a great example that more does not always equal better. I knew going in the basic premise of the book. And I admit that I wondered how a subject like death and loss could be squeezed into 199 pages and still work. But it does, in every way.<br /><br />As you can gather from the synopsis, Mia is in a terrible accident, an accident that claims the lives of her immediate family. And the scenes that describe the accident and it's aftermath are pretty horrifying. But it is the period in which Mia lies comatose, yet somehow is outside of her body watching the scene unfold around her, that makes up the meat of this story. That in itself would constitute a great story. But Forman takes it a step further by writing in Mia's memories of her life: her relationships with her parents; her little brother; and her grandparents. In addition, Mia also flashes back to her experiences with her boyfriend Adam and her best friend Kim, and it was those two connections that especially spoke to me as I was reading.<br /><br />Mia has a decision to make, and it's not as simple as it sounds. Should she stay, in a world without her parents and little brother, or should she go, and leave her remaining family, boyfriend and friends behind. Her memories of all she has gone through with all of the people in her life push and pull at her as she struggles to figure out what choice she must make.<br /><br />One thing that amazes me about this book is that even though it has been widely read and reviewed, I never knew what her decision would be, prior to reading. Now, one could surmise the ending, what with there being a sequel to this book. But as I was reading, I let that slip from my mind and read it as if without that knowledge, and found that it was remarkably easy to do so. I was caught up in the book, always wondering as the pages went by what Mia would do.<br /><br />Without a doubt my very favorite aspect of the book was Mia's relationship with her best friend Kim. The passages between Mia and Kim are so wonderful, I would read a book just about the two of them and their friendship any day. This next passage comes from one of Mia's flashback memories:<br /><br />...I rode over to Kim's house to vent. She listened to my diatribe, her expression purposefully blas&eacute;.<br />  \\"That's just ridiculous that he only likes people like him,\\" she scolded when I finished spewing. \\"he likes you, and you're not like him.\\"<br />  \\"That's the problem,\\" I mumble.<br />  \\"Well then deal with that. Don't drag me into your drama,\\" she said. \\"besides, I don't really click with him either.\\"<br />  \\"You don't?\\"<br />  \\"No, Mia. Not everyone swoons for Adam.\\"<br />  \\"I didn't mean it like that. It's just that I want you guys to be friends.\\"<br />  \\"Yeah, well, I want to live in New York City and have normal parents. As the man said, 'You can't always get what you want.'\\"<br />  \\"But you're the two most important people in my life.\\"<br />  Kim looked at my red and teary face and her expression softened into a gentle smile. \\"We know that, Mia. But we're from different parts of your life, just like music and me are from different parts of your life. And that's fine. You don't have to choose one or the other, at least not as far as I'm concerned.\\"<br />  \\"But I want those parts of my life to come together.\\"<br />  Kim shook her head.\\"It doesn't work that way. Look, I accept Adam because you love him. And I assume he accepts mebecause you love me. If it makes you feel any better, your love binds us. And that's enough. Me and him don't have to love each other.\\"<br />  \\"But I want you to,\\" I wailed.<br />  \\"Mia,\\" Kim said, an edge of warning in her voice signaling the end of her patience. \\"You're starting to act like one of those girls. Do you need to get me a gun?\\"<br /><br />Isn't Kim awesome? The scenes between she and Mia were so authentic it reminded me of some of my own best friends. Reading the comfortable dialogue between the two felt like a page from my own life story.<br /><br />I also love the portrayal of Mia's parents and grandparents in If I Stay. It's clear that Mia and her parents are close, and I think this book is testament to the fact that author's can indeed write about healthy relationships between teenagers and their parents in YA literature today.<br /><br />And it's possible to write about beautiful and loving, yet also complicated, romantic relationships as well. I loved that Adam was a hard core rocker and Mia was a classically trained musician, so different but alike. Without their shared love of music the differences between the two might have driven them apart. It's awesome that music instead unites them. Adam and Mia aren't the perfect couple, they have their ups and downs, but they clearly respect each other's thoughts and goals. They face everyday, real problems that young people face in real life, and I loved reading it. And yes, there are some sweet AND swoony moments included too. Adam is what I would call a definite keeper:)<br /><br />This book is emotional to be sure. And yes, I did cry, especially with the parts concerning her little brother (those hit me SO very hard) but somehow I was not a blubbering mess, as I was with other books I have read. I think that is because while there is death and loss in this book, there was also so much life and love. As Mia comes to realize: dying is easy, it's living life that can be hard. And through Adam and Kim, Mia is reminded that there can be a life for her even with all the loss she has suffered.<br /><br />Kim stops and smiles for a split second. Then she makes this funny noise, a cross between a cough and a throat-clearing. I've heard her make this sound before; it's what she does when she's summoning her courage, getting ready to jump off the rocks and into the bracing river water.<br /><br />  \\"I do have a point to all this,\\" she continues. There are like twenty people in that waiting room right now. Some of them are related to you. Some of them are not. But we're all your family.\\"<br />  She stops now. Leans over me so that the wisps of her hair tickle my face. She kisses me on the forehead. \\"You still have a family,\\" she whispers.<br /> I absolutely shivered when I read that in the book. Kim always knows just what to say.<br /><br />The end of the book moves fast, and the climax really builds up as the moment comes when Mia must choose. I think that the way Forman wrote this scene was spectacular. I re-read it a couple of times because it's pretty powerful. I can't include an excerpt, it wouldn't do it justice taken from the whole, you have to read it yourself. But it is beautiful and gut wrenching and breathtaking all at the same time. I will say that if I hadn't been in love with Adam by this point, I definitely was by the book's end. And you know what is the best part? The sequel, Where She Went, which released this time last year, is written from Adam's point of view! I can not wait to read it you guys!<br /><br />I loved If I Stay, it was deserving of the hype and packed one heck of a wallop for such a slim volume. Forman's writing is top notch and I can not wait to read Adam's take on things in the sequel Where She Went.<br /><br />4.5/5 Starse you love me. If it makes you feel any better, your love binds us.

B0072GPQNG|1.0|I despair that so many people think this movie is good.  One of the worst movies ever made.  A lot of money & time spent jerking people around with cruelty to animals.  Shame on you, Spielberg!
B0018QQQK8|5.0|This book was very good, it was a quick read and didn't lag so it was hard to put down.  I read it on my kindle and loved how the ending kept you guessing until the very end.  Overall great book, very entertaing and now I can go see the movie to see if it compares at all.
B007IXWL2C|3.0|I read the trilogy in roughly 5 days.  It was an easy, predictable read.  Somewhat annoying with the frequent use of the same words (Mr. Grey, Mrs. Grey, Holy F@#$, Holy S$%^, Oh Ana, Baby.)  Seriously, the English language is vast and the writer could have been more creative.  The F-word was used way too much for my taste.  Where were the editors?<br /><br />I do think EL James left some meat and potatoes on her plate (I had to use that pun, Christian yells at Ana constantly about eating.)  Christian's character, his life, his \\"crack whore\\" Mom and his early years are a 2-part series itself.  I hope she considers exploring his character development, family and his relationship with Mrs. Robinson and the \\"subs\\" in future books.<br /><br />The timeline was too short and the trilogy seemed rushed.  These people met, slept together, introduced the parents, married and had a child within a year.  Why the rush?  Why not expand on the Christian/Grace scene at the masquerade ball?  The Hyde story was wrapped up a little too easy for me as well.  He was arrested, bailed out, then managed to kidnap and blackmail Ana in roughly a week.  Again, why the rush?  A priceless scene would have been to have Hyde and Christian face-to-face as Hyde explained how they know each other!  Another missed opportunity, there were many throughout the book.<br /><br />I liked that Ana hung in there with her guy, but why turn Christian to milktoast?  The section where he drops to his knees and begs her to stay was way over the top and completely out of line with his character.<br /><br />Overall, too rushed; too many unexplored story lines; but a decent effort.

B004VRK436|4.0|When \\"Zathura\\" was released, I was head projectionist at Wichita's Warren Theatre and I recall being impressed with the visuals but I never got to see the whole movie.  (A projectionists work is never done) So I was glad to get the BluRay for not a lot of money.  For the \\"family sci-fi crowd\\" this is a very entertaining film and is was fun the see \\"Twilight girl\\" Christen Stewart in an early role, not to mention Dax Shephard from TV's \\"Parenthood.\\"  The real star of this movie, though are the special effects.  absolutely breathtaking!
B000WC39SG|5.0|This is one of the best war movies ever made! An historically accurate portrayal of Operation Market Garden (the best part is the fact that the German officers and soldiers speak GERMAN, not English!). A grand scale production, considering the fact that it was made in 1977 and there was no computer modeling, images or enhancements at all.<br />If you own a Blu-ray player and you think you would enjoy an All-Star cast, great directing and production, along with a gritty film about the biggest Allied blunder in World War 2 I highly recommend this.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I love it! It's so easy to work with, and it's by far one of my favorite apps. Freakin' awesome.
B0052U59F4|5.0|I sped through this book and dashed to get the following sequels. Why?...because the love and control issues were as fascinating as the explicit sex. Both main characters had well-drawn histories. The emails between the two were clever and funny. I want to read all three books again. Readers may think \\"too much sex,\\" but the heart of the story was how people transform themselves through the power of love. READ this book!
B007PTJOV0|5.0|I play this ALL the time :) it is just like Mario! easy to learn how to play and great graphics!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|i loved this book! I just couldnt put it down.there was a great plot and it shows we need to be careful or society could come to this state.as a teenager i loved this book and i would recomend it to anyone 12 and up. :)
B007PTJOV0|5.0|this game is just like super mario it is so awesome i would recommend this game. it is very addicting
B003O86FMW|4.0|With the first book ending like it did I knew I had to read the second one.I enjoyed it as much as the first.You learn more about all the characters and picture how they look.It builds on the relationships from book one.Very easy reading ,didn't take long to finish it.Hope they make a movie of it too.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|the game has a leader board levels are not verry hard it is like supper mario and this game is good for kids.
B0064NTZ6W|5.0|This is a classic war movie, and the BD edition is great. I had seen this movie years ago when it came out in the theaters, but it was just as moving now as it was then. The human side of the story is just as moving as the historical documentation of a real story of this crew and the historical significance of the war in the Atlantic. Forty thousand Germans sailors fought in U-Boots, and three out of four never made it back.<br /><br />It is a great movie about war. It is not an anti-war movie as such, and this adds to its value. There is no ideology here: it attempts to document what this particular aspect of the war at sea was like, and it does so with flying colors.<br /><br />The submarine in question is U-96, whose name was used as the title for the movie in some countries. The film is not always historically accurate. For example the real sub never used La Rochelle as a base, but St Nazaire, and was destroyed much later in the war, in Germany.<br /><br />I found the bonus disc very interesting, you get a clear picture of the technology for special effects of the time (early eighties).<br /><br />If you want to get... ahem... deeper! into this subject, you might want to read the book that this film was based on. [[ASIN:0304352314 Das Boot: The Boat]]<br /><br />Now if you are a real U-Boot buff, consider getting the non-fiction book by the same author, with many great photos he took while on real patrols in the Atlantic. [[ASIN:349204042X U- Boot Krieg. Sonderausgabe.]]

B007IXWKUK|1.0|I concur with the other reviewers who noted that Fifty Shades of Gray volume ! was an imperfect but enjoyable read. It's not quite soft-core porn, but rather erotica with a \\"BDSM for dummies\\" appeal, as one online reviewer put it.  The riffs on TWILIGHT are funny and smart in the first book, and the sex scenes are well-thought out and effective. Book 1 contains information on what a dominant/submissive contract might look like, introduces the idea of \\"safe words\\" and shows that it is possible to have a good time, while at the same time practicing safe sex.  All good stuff.<br /><br />This book reverts to Harlequin Romance type plotting, with terrible dialogue, and repetitive and uninteresting sex scenes. Having been presented with a BDSM direction in Book 1, the reader gets 1 or 2 of these scenes, because the book is so busy backtracking and reducing the hero's orientations to early childhood trauma.  In this connection, I agree entirely with one Amazon reviewer who complained about the very negative portrayal of the BDSM community in this book, and particularly of dominant women in that world.  It's sexist and misleading. And, _must_ the older, sexualized woman turn out to be \\"the bad guy?\\" Again?  Dull.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|This game is amazingly fun. I recommend it to anyone who likes Mario Bros or just likes ti have fun. The only downside is that the controls take a little bit of time to get used to. however, the same can be said about any other game, so you'll be fine!!
B004O3YGMC|5.0|This app will do so much for you as long as you have your computer setup to what you like from music, video,tv,adobe, and just runs like your real pc.

I rate this a slam dunk 5/5, it will change the way we all use are pc's today.

B003XF1XOQ|2.0|I'm not sure what happened to Suzanne Collins as she was writing the 3rd Hunger Games book, but I think she completely fell asleep.

B003Z2LAAO|1.0|From the label I was sure I would be getting a 3D version of the Grand Canyon IMAX movie, which I watched several times; what I got to find out instead is the shortage of water, did not get any of the amazing shots I was expecting having seen the original Grand Canion on IMAX, and the technical quality of the 3D is not spectacular.<br /><br />The title and cover image were clearly intended to deceive. Check each 3D DVD you buy to make sure it doesn't have, in small print, a subtitle that says stg different from the title.

I hope that it is fixed right.  Hoping to play soon.

I have to say I got exactly what I thought. The movie was<br />entertaining enough to keep me interested but the big problem was that<br />the longer it went on the cheesier and more far-fetched it got. I would<br />call this a little like \\"Day After Tomorrow\\" with aliens. Overall,<br />there are worse ways to spend an hour and a half. Entertaining but a<br />little laughable the longer it went on. I give it a B-.

B0071XO8RA|5.0|Hugh Howey is now one of my favorite SF writers.  I downloaded this Kindle book because I was going on a trip and wanted a bunch of reading material without spending a lot of money.  I haven't been hooked to this degree since I read \\"I Robot\\" (a long, long time ago).  These five stories/books were so good that I went through them so quickly that I ended up having to buy more books while on my trip (and they were all Howey books).
B005XTLAQQ|5.0|Although I have never seen any of the Twilight movies or read any of the books I bought this doll for my daughter because it is such a beautiful doll. The dress is exquisite. There are little covered buttons all down the back and she is wearing a full length veil attached to a pretty comb in her hair. The doll itself is very pretty and  the dress just takes it over the top. I would recommend this doll to anyone.  Twilight fans or not it really doesn't matter. I think this is the most beautiful Barbie bride doll I have ever seen!
B0063IH60K|4.0|game is reliable, doesn't crash, basic play is easy.  great for free. plays well on HTC incredible and kindle fire.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|this is so fun! is just like Mario with few differences, I would rate this 10 stars if I could!
B000X107GI|1.0|I bought this pack of battery. New batteries taken out of the pack shows it has only 50% of the charge i.e, 50% is dead.

B0015AARJI|5.0|You cannot beat the official Sony controller for PS3. At this price they are still slightly more expensive than the generic wireless controllers, but still totally worth it.
B0063IH60K|4.0|Game is not bad to play and I recommand it.  The features are not bad either.  Great for anyone who loves to play Solitaire.
B0061TQBRK|2.0|I just bought this album and have only listened to it twice. Unlike the other reviewers, I am writing the review of the album itself, not amazon or any other companies marketing/business practices.<br />I am a fan of Lacuna Coil and have all their previous albums. I bought this one simply because it said Lacuna Coil, not having previously heard any of the songs. Should have previewed it. I could change my mind after hearing it a few more times but so far I believe it to be their worst album so far. Nowhere near the quality of Karmacode or Shallow life, or even Comalies. It may grow on me though.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I have a kindle fire and it works great. it is also addicting.<br />if you like solitaire get this app its awesome.
B006MW3UZW|4.0|My wife and I have watched both season One and two and have really enjoyed this series and are looking forward for season III.<br /><br />The Brits do a magnificent job in choosing the characters who play their roles to perfection. The background of the story set for that period is done in such a way that makes you appreciate how Britain suffered during World War I.  The costumes are done to perfection.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|This game is well made and very fun. I'm even enjoying the pictures between levels. Not exactly sure what the story has to do with mahjong but it's interesting all the same.
B002SSBD6W|5.0|This book completely changed my life. It has gotten me to question mysef as a person, and the world. If you only read one book your entire life, let it be this one.
1400049628|4.0|I genuinely loved this book, but really can only recommend it to die-hard zombie fans. Brooks' other book on the subject, [[ASIN:0307346617 World War Z: An Oral History of the Zombie War]], I would recommend to any reader.<br /><br />This book is a guide to surviving the zombie apocalypse, and there is even a chapter dedicated to fighting back when the time comes.<br /><br />It covers such vital topics as choosing weapons, the essential supplies you'll need, how to choose vehicles and how to fortify your home.<br /><br />It's a little slow and certainly not as compelling as World War Z. Some of the book comes across as repetitive, as the chapter on choosing a fortress and the chapter on fighting back will both discuss the terrains you may encounter, for example.<br /><br />I think the fact that I have so little to say about this book kinda speaks for itself. I still haven't shut up about how awesome World War Z was. Perhaps if I had read this book first (and it was written first) I would have enjoyed it more.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|it is a lot like Mario bros I love it my kids really like playing it too. keeps me busy when I don't have anything to do
B0053O89WY|5.0|Does anyone know when this comes out exactly? I wanted to order it but I am not sure the date of release and thought maybe someone could help me out. I am so excited about season 5 coming to dvd.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|its fun. and is similar to Mario bros.  I need more words to submit this review about this app. there!
B007PTJOV0|5.0|like the other reviewers have stated, this game is Mario's Irish copycat... it's well-made though and I like how it reminds me of playing Mario as a kid.
B00466HM28|5.0|I use this to record my band and other songs into garage band. Plugged right in, no drivers to install, computer recognized it immediately. I am missing out on a lot of this thing's capabilities by using it only in garageband, but for what I need it for, it's perfect. I use it to make drum beats and to add tambourine and other percussion instruments for our tracks. I researched a ton before I bought this one. Touch sensitive keys are great although they are mini keys. I could have got a lot better midi controller, but for the money, this one suits my band's needs just fine.
B003Y5H574|5.0|This is such a great movie! My husband and I really enjoyed it. It's funnny, refreshing, and there's a lot of surprises! I've watched it 3x and I still want to watch it again and again!<br /><br />Watch this movie!!! You won't regret it! :)
B004LWZW7Y|5.0|I, unfortunately, have the time yet to watch this great movie, but plan on doing so when my partner gets back in town.
0345803485|5.0|Loved these books.  They were complete escape and I looked forward to reading EVERYDAY!  Cannot wait to see the movie - please do not disappoint!
B004JZBGWI|5.0|loved this app! perfect for any notes, and has a unique color-coded organization process. great for school, home, or office use. really enjoyed the checklist option for notes
B003K16P50|3.0|Middle-aged fisheries scientist Alfred Jones lives a rather ordinary, quiet, unremarkable life until one day he receives a positively ludicrous, laughable request -- a Yemeni sheikh wants to introduce the sport of salmon fishing to his home country. Salmon in the desert? Impossible -- or so Alfred thinks, resigning the unorthodox request to the dustbin of extreme eccentricity. But Sheikh Muhammad is a visionary man who refuses to let the fact that something has never been done determine whether or not it is possible. And so the dream of salmon fishing in the Yemen takes on a life of its own as everyone from Alfred's supervisor to the Prime Minister's office seeks to leverage the story and its opportunities for their own personal and professional gain. Unwittingly drawn into this massive project that should be impossible, Alfred finds his eyes opened and his worldview challenged by the visionary sheikh's dream and the power of believing in belief, even when all hope seems lost.<br /><br />This slim novel is far out side the norm of my usual reading picks -- but when the film trailers were released I couldn't resist checking out the book on which the movie was based. I think Salmon Fishing in the Yemen is quite simply one of the most intriguing, evocative book titles ever. Based on the film trailers I expected a sweet romantic comedy. And while the novel is infused with a healthy dose of humor, I wasn't expecting the biting social sarcasm, the bracing send-up of government bureaucracy and modern marriage, to name just a few of the subjects Torday tackles in his debut. Salmon Fishing rather defies categorization, and that's saying something in a world were Pride and Prejudice and Zombies exists. *wink* Torday's humor is subtler, his wit and insights regarding Western politics and the news media sharp and insightful.<br /><br />The novel consists of e-mails, diary entries, transcripts and news articles. My favorite entries are those from Alfred and Harriet's (the latter being the estate agent that enlists Alfred's expertise for the project) perspectives. While I appreciated Torday's pointed jabs at government processes and the exigencies of the volatile political climate in the Middle East, where this story works best is in its examination of the struggles and heartbreak Alfred and Harriet experience while striving to bring the sheik's dream to fruition. Alfred's gradual, slow-burning awakening to the beauty and power of belief in belief, in the power of dreaming, is beautifully realized, and its a testament to Torday's ability to craft heart-breakingly realistic characters that I wanted more of them and less social commentary. Salmon Fishing in the Yemen was an unexpectedly poignant, at times melancholy (but sweetly so), a delightful, ultimately highly readable venture outside my reading norm that proved to be a powerful reminder of the power and importance of belief and faith to the human experience.being the estate agent that enlists Alfred's expertise for the project) perspectives.

B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love the Bible so there is no right or wrong version to it. I just think its wrong to have to have wifi that's just wrong for the Bible though. I think that should be a choice. but with the wifi it gibes a lot of options so that's nice. the man that talks it Is just so weird the Bible rocks!!!!
B005MYEQ4U|5.0|My husband and I just finished watching this movie and we both enjoyed it tremendously. It is witty and romantic and, as my husband put it, a little far fetched, although we both loved it.<br />I must add that I was never a great fan of Owen Wilson, but in this movie he shines.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Enthralling new dystopian science fiction. This is a page-turner with great characters, setting and plot developments which will pull you in and keep you reading.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I wasn't interested in reading this trilogy but both my daughters got on my case and insisted that I at least get The Hunger Games so we could go see the movie together.I always like to read the book first so I gave in, now I'm on the last book Monkingjay and will finish it before both my daughters. I started on the first book,and couldn't stop and I'm not looking forward to the day I finish it[[ASIN:B003XF1XOQ Mockingjay (The Final Book of The Hunger Games)]]. Really enjoyed it, and looking for my next great book.
0802798225|4.0|What can I say? I devoured this book in less than twenty-four hours and it had nothing to do with being that short. It was just that awesome. Thus was the first non-supernatural book ive read in a while and will definitely not be the last by this author. I plan ti read all three stories in this series. What a fantastic love story . True love knows no colors; don't I know that all to well!
B0050DIWFC|5.0|I was surprised by how elegantly written this novel is. The characters are complex and believable, the story unfolded with unexpected turns and nuance, and the prose was so unexpectedly beautiful for a crime novel. I loved this book!! I usually consider crime novels to be 'beach reading' (light, quick), but this was deep and moving.
1612130283|1.0|I had been hearing a lot about this book so I decided to give it a try. I gave it a valiant effort, I got to chapter 13 while most people gave up much earlier. This book is really poorly written and frankly, I found it downright disturbing. The main character is about as \\"wet-blankety\\" and uninspired as you can get. I found her love interest to be so grotesquely arrogant that no amount of attractiveness could make me want to stand in a room with him let alone succumb to his unconventional and psychotic requests. I didn't find the \\"sex scenes\\" particularly hot. And I am so bugged by the fact that this author expects me to believe that a 21 year old is graduating college without ever having an email address (or a computer). The little details like that turned me off as well as the abhorrent characters.<br /><br />As someone who usually enjoys the  currently \\"hyped\\" books, I can whole heartedly not recommend this garbage.
1416511946|5.0|I just finished reading The Heroin Diaries by Nikki Sixx. The Heroin Diaries is a journal he kept in 1987 as he descended into the hellish abyss of addiction as he and his band, Motley Crue, toured the country. I saw them in Biloxi, MS of that year. It was interesting to see what was going on in his head the very day that I saw them perform. It was also the day that they made the cover of Rolling Stone only to be disrespected with this headline: \\"Heavy Metal: It's Loud, It's Ugly, It Won't Go Away.\\"<br /><br />  Yeah, I admit it: in the eighties I was a teenage headbanger with a mullet haircut and wore black, heavy metal concert T-shirts and blue jeans. Every square inch of my bedroom walls was covered with pictures of Nikki Sixx and his cohorts. The fact that he was one of my biggest idols (I even had a dog named Nikki) was a heroin junkie should have foretold my own descent into junkie-dom. But I must admit that Nikki's decadence was a lot more glamorous than my own.<br /><br />  It sounds as if he flushed more drugs down the toilet out of paranoia that year than I ingested in all of my twenty year using career. And it just goes to show that drug addiction affects the poor differently than the rich. When the withdrawals started, all he had to do was pick up the phone. He never woke up wondering where he was going to get enough money to help him make it through the day without getting sick.<br /><br />  This journal-type memoir is better than the typical addiction memoir, because no matter how committed to honesty the memoirist may be, memories distort and degrade through the years. But with the Heroin Diaries, you see addiction in real-time, day-by-day as it's happening. And you can see that Sixx was clearly happier on the days when he managed to clean up. When he was strung out, he wrote the words I've uttered to myself so many times during my addiction: \\"People don't make sense to me...I have no comfort zone. I don't know how to live. I feel like an alien.\\"<br /><br />Written by David Allan Reeves<br />Author of \\"Running Away From Me\\"><br />Written by David Allan Reeves<br />Author of \\"Running Away From Me\\"

0307592731|5.0|This is the best book I have read in a long time. It resonated with me because I have been toying with the idea of hiking the AT or PCT in order to \\"find myself\\" again. After reading about Cheryl Strayed's experiences I feel like I have a better idea of what I'd be in for. She lays it out - all the good and the bad - while tying it all together with memories of her life. I felt connected to her writing and related to a lot of the feelings she expressed about her life. I loved everything about this book and encourage you to read it.
