0099549050|3.0|The world changed for Aomame when she climbed down an evacuation exit along a highway, like a latter-day Alice, to beat a traffic jam at the start of Book One, and Tengo, when he embarked on ghostwriting 'The Air Chrysalids'. Book Three converges the paths of the \\"moon-crossed\\" lovers, Aomame and Tengo, as the reader anticipates with bated breath for them to finally meet in this alternate universe of 1Q84.<br /><br />Murakami adds the narrative of Ushikawa, the investigator with the misshapen head (cruelly christened as 'Bobble-head' by the other characters) into the mix. While Ushikawa's perspective clarifies some parts of the plot to us, I found the story being slowed down by his overly-detailed (and repetitive) musings about the connection between Aomame and Tengo, as well as the 'Little People'.<br /><br />I only doggedly followed through to the end of the third book because I wanted to find out if the questions raised in Books One and Two are answered; e.g. the mystery of Tengo's mother's disappearance, his parentage, and the true identity of Fuka Eri , the (almost annoyingly) reticent seventeen-year-old girl whose 'Air Chrysalis' provided the link to the world of 1Q84 and the eerie doubling seen in the 'maza' and 'dohta' phenomenon.<br /><br />Murakami does, by way of Ushikawa's detective work, reveal some of these mysteries, though many loose ends remain; e.g. if Tengo's father is in some way connected to the murder of Ayumi, the policewoman friend of Aomame, reincarnated as Kumi, the nurse at the palliative care hospital he ends up in. For such a lengthy opus (more than a thousand pages in all), I felt a little short-changed.(

0385333846|4.0|Billy Pilgrim, the protagonist of novel, became a sort of cult figure in American popular culture, and it's not difficult to see why. Slaughterhouse-five is a war novel with a twist. It rather cleverly, and in a deliberately obvious, self-conscious manner, disguises itself as a science-fiction piece about time travel and aliens. Framed by a narrator who is a war veteran, he embarks on writing an account of his experiences in WW2 when he was a POW in Dresden, Germany.<br /><br />The novel that he writes turns out to be about Billy Pilgrim, a war vet like himself, but Dresden becomes just an episode within his narrative about his experiences as a time-traveller. The shift of focus suggests that the brutality of the war experience is too harsh and horrific to be addressed head-on and that it needs to be looked at sideways, mediated by a layered narrative.<br /><br />Seemingly farcical, born-loser Billy is something of a joke in the army, and his position is non-combat and perfunctory. Death recurs in the novel, and as a way of cushioning the blow, the narrator always appends any mention of it with \\"and so it goes\\".<br /><br />Vonnegut has a distinctive style of writing that is disjointed and episodic, which is filmic in quality, akin to the way a scene fades out to the next. Perhaps this style is also in keeping with the story of a man who becomes \\"unstuck in time\\" and begins to view life not as a continuum, and death not as an end, but rather as moments which, when chronology is taken away, causes the finality of circumstances to lose their significance, which also takes away the sting of hopeless events in one's life.<br /><br />Humorous despite the gravity of the issues dealt with in the novel, Vonnegut manages to adopt an authorial perspective that is neither prescriptive nor heavy-handed, allowing him to speak truthfully about the pain of human suffering without the melodrama.
B004EPYZU8|5.0|Wonderful film, with the perfect mix of fantasy action and surrealistic angst. I can't believe I waited so long to see it.<br /><br />Also the film arrived in 48 hrs from order (not on prime), in excellent condition and was very reasonable pricing. I bought this as something cheap to entertain me for a night. Instead it has a spot in my permanent film collection instead. A pleasant surprise.

B008220D5K|3.0|Do you remember the movie, Knocked Up? Yeah. This is the sort-of sequel to it, only not really. This Is 40 occurs several years after the events of Knocked Up and takes a more in depth look at the lives of Pete (Paul Rudd) and Debbie (Leslie Mann) as they approach 40. From professional problems to money issues to setting a good example for the kids and dealing with their own parental demons, Deb and Pete struggle to cope with the \\"joys\\" of being middle-aged. Trivia Note: The main characters from Knocked Up, Ben (Seth Rogen) and Alison (Katherine Heigl), do not appear in this in the movie but references to both characters are made, for those looking hard enough.<br /><br />I am one of those people that really enjoys most of Judd Apatow's projects, so choosing to see it in the theatre was a fairly sure bet for me. And like all Apatow's films, This Is 40 is spot on with keen insights, even if those insights and comedy behind them are of the raunch variety. Apatow is brilliant when it comes to making mundane, every day realities obscenely funny and it's no exception in This Is 40.  However, the plot isn't anything particularly revolutionary and there isn't much of a solid storyline at all. It's more a patchwork of funny scenes threaded together with some tension and drama. It's like one of those long SNL digital shorts that doesn't really know how or when to stop, but you watch it anyway because even though it's long and drawn out, it's still entertaining. Yep. That's This Is 40 in a nutshell.<br /><br />If there's one strength in this movie, I'd say hands down it's the cast. Paul Rudd and Leslie Mann clearly have their comedic timing down and play incredibly well off one another. Rudd does his usual lovable/goofy humour and it works (as always) whereas Mann takes on most of the film's dramedy moments. Their veteran married couple banter is the reason to watch the film and it's those scenes that steal the show. Interestingly enough, Apatow and Mann's actual children play Mann and Rudd's kids in the movie. The girls, though sometimes stiff, had some surprisingly memorable moments and their sisterly banter felt very real (as I presume some of it was). Another thing to look out for are the amazing comedic cameos from Jason Segal, Melissa McCarthy and Chris O'Dowd. They provide the most laughs, by far.<br /><br />I guess my biggest issue with the film is that it stresses the financial woes of the couple as Pete's record studio is failing and Debbie deals with employee theft, but Apatow clearly has no realistic idea of what constitutes financial struggling for the average person. Pete and Debbie live in this grand, gorgeous house, they drive a BMW and Lexus respectively AND take lavish vacations to Mexico just because they can. Seriously, Judd? You're making middle class America really angry right now. But I won't even get too deep into this rant because that's not what the core of this film is about. It's about not taking life too seriously, acceptance and appreciation. But honestly, you watch this movie for the comedy more than you do for the life lessons.  This Is 40  certainly isn't Apatow's best film, but it ranks better than average racy crap that's out there. And while it isn't quite as funny as, say,  Bridesmaids, it's certainly one of the funnier movies I saw in 2012. Rudd and Mann reel it in and provide some much desired entertainment street cred, for sure.<br /><br />Food for Thought: Overall, I liked This Is 40, though that's not to say I didn't have my issues with it. It's entertaining and downright funny while sometimes verging on clever. But this is one of those films you watch to laugh more than learn, and if you can be okay with that (and the random crude humour) then I think you'll enjoy it too.y Mann and Rudd's kids in the movie.

159102594X|5.0|If you don't mind a sometimes grim series filled with morally ambiguous characters and the occasional anti-hero protagonist, you'll enjoy the First Law trilogy.<br /><br />Abercrombie writes with a very accessible, easy-to-read style and does an excellent job of creating internally-consistent main characters that each feel different from the others. In fact, I'd say that is one of Abercrombie's biggest strengths as an author - being able to get inside each character and write chapters in a voice that is completely unique to that character's way of acting, speaking, and even thinking.<br /><br />The setting is low fantasy, so while there is some magic, it's relatively limited; don't expect titanic battles with wizards slinging massively powerful spells willy-nilly. Mages are few and far between and prefer to let their (often unwitting) henchmen project their power instead of expending the great effort it takes to cast spells. Fantastical monsters are also pretty scarce, and the majority of conflict in the series takes place between different factions of various human empires, kingdoms, and tribes.<br /><br />In short, if you're looking for a solid, but often bloody, fantasy series to pick up, the First Law books (and the 3 standalones - \\"Best Served Cold\\", \\"Heroes\\", and \\"Red Country\\") are all excellent reads.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|Amazing I love this book . It's my favorite out of all of them. Keep writing them cause I will buy them all

There are no turns or surprises .<br />But if you are looking for a fun action film, give it a shot
B00A8ECU24|3.0|As a huge MLP fan, I really wanted to love this game and be able to write a 5 star review for it but I simply can't. Although the game is fun and addictive, there are several problems with it and a lot of it has to do with this edition not being updated despite the fact that several updates have been released for the ipad and regular android versions that addresses the lack of gems within the game.<br /><br />To start, there are a lot of complaints about gems being hard to earn and having to buy your way through the game.  This is absolutely true.  However the ipad and android versions received a few updates that created several more ways for gems to be earned.  In the Kindle fire version, gems are only earned at a rate of 3 per week IF you logged in everyday and collected your daily bonus.  Plus 1 or 2 every few new levels earned.  In the updated version on ipad and android, a gem is earned with EACh new level gained and gems can also drop when clicking on derpy, parasprites and filling the elements with shards. Now these new updates would not have made you gem rich anytime soon, but ANY new ways to earn gems is an improvement over NOT having them and NOT having them is what the Kindle fire edition currently suffers with.<br /><br />Both the ipad and android versions received a winter update that included a new shop and a snow scene for your town. This update was released Dec 20, 2012 on ipad, January 4, 2013 on android.  As of today, Jan 10, 2013 this update is not on the kindle fire edition.  If the ice cream shop is a limited winter edition available only with this update, you can expect a serious downgrade in stars.<br /><br />Another huge problem with this game are your neighbors.  On the Ipad version you can be neighbors with everyone.  On android however, you can only be neighbors with other android users.  So although I have ipad friends who play this game and can see me as a neighbor and visit me and send me gifts, I cannot do the same for them.  Althoughthey've accepted my neighbor request, I cannot access them as a neighbor.  I cannot visit them or gift them.  That makes me a crappy neighbor to those who play on the ipad.<br /><br />But of course, if there is an update that involves sale items that requires the use of cash, I get those!<br /><br />There are various other annoying little problems with this edition of the game.  It likes to crash for no apparent reason every so often.  Connection to gameloft seems a little unstable as I sometimes have to reconnect to them a couple times before getting to my profile.  Also I have one particular neighbor that crashes the game each time I try to visit her.  However none of these would have prevented me from spending real money on this game.  The reason I haven't spent a single penny on it is the fact that this edition has NOT received the updates that the ipad and android versions have received.  I cannot justify spending money on a game that is not truly fully functional.<br /><br />Overall the game is fun, even if a little difficult to progress in the kindle edition.  But as an MLP fan I'm a little biased towards pretty ponies running around on my screen.  Others would probably not enjoy this game much.  Ideally, play this on an ipad.  Second choice would be any android device with access to google play.  I would only recommend playing the kindle fire edition if you do not have access to the other 2 platforms.

B003XMKN40|5.0|This is a fabulous compilation of the 3-day 2007 Crossroads Guitar Festival.  The festival benefits the Crossroads Centre founded by Eric Clapton, a drug treatment center located in Antigua.

As Eric addressed the 2007 audience, he praised the performers as some of the very best, and those who had earned his respect in the music world.<br />The Festival appears to be repeated every three years; 2004, 2007, 2010, etc.

Highly recommend to any Blur fan who knows that vinyl has a far better sound quality than any digital medium. (In other words, skip the CDs and MP3s; this is worth the price.) Couldn't be happier with this purchase!

B002OSXDAU|3.0|I am hardly a professional review writer, but I did want to give my input on the editing within the Kindle edition of this book. The Kindle edition has quite a few typographical errors that do not appear in the actual hard copy. I am a bit disappointed that the persons that transferred this book to Kindle did not do a better job at proof reading in order to prevent the simple errors that are very distracting throughout the progress of this book. I also do not like that there is only one review form for both copies because mine will probably get lost among the others and I do not want to give this book as a whole a low rating because there is a good story line and I like the way that the author builds on her characters. The really should be a review form for the kindle edition. Don't get me wrong the Kindle edition is readable, but it is hard to figure out sometimes when there are quotation marks in all the wrong places.
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|This third  book of the Hunger Games Series just seemed to drag on and on.  The whole book seemed to be about the big fight at the end.  I thought it boring, lacking any plot, except the fight, and very little cohesiveness to the whole story.  Somewhere, the story got lost in the book.  I really liked the first book, the second seemed to be just a bridge to the third, and i was glad to get to the end of the third book.

B00A6SZS2Q|5.0|I should state that I am not the biggest fan of heavy rock music. But, I am musically open-minded.  Sometimes I try to like music that I previously didn't like. Recently, I have begun to like heavy rock if it's melodic, or the lead vocalist has a good voice.  I enjoyed the Black Veil Brides when I first heard them, and have grown to enjoy them even more.  Andy Biersack has a powerful voice and their music is catchy.<br /><br />Based on internet comments, it seems like BVB has a lot of haters, more than other bands.  I think it's undeserved. Their tunes are well-crafted and have quality lyrical content. Andy, Ashley Purdy, Jinxx, Jake, and CC are all talented at what they do.<br /><br />\\"Wretched and Divine\\" is a step forward from their last album \\"Set The World On Fire\\".  STWOF was great, but the tunes on W&D are more complex and have more sophisticated lyrical content. Andy Biersack's voice is also stronger, and Jinxx and Ashley Purdy are even better guitarists.<br /><br />All the songs are tied together by a common theme: A rebel's survival in an apocalyptic world. Anthemic choruses, constant loud guitars, and occasional symphonic flourishes are present on \\"Wrenched and Divine\\".  The strongest tracks on the album are \\"I Am Bulletproof\\", \\"New Years Day\\", \\"We Don't Belong\\", \\"Shadows Die\\", \\"Overture\\", and \\"In The End\\".  The first three, plus \\"In The End\\", have the best choruses.  \\"Shadows Die\\" has the most complex rhythms of the album. The two minute \\"Overture\\" showcase Jinxx's talents as a violinist (which is also seen in other parts of the album).<br /><br />Just check this album out, even if you're not a fan. You might be surprised.<br /><br />(4.50 out of 5 stars)<br /><br />--Isa R Bufano (01.09.2013)
B008673ZAQ|5.0|This sequel was fabulous. I was  right there with Eva frustrated and saying kick him to the curb. I also love  the fact that this one went a totally different route with the ending. Great read, looking forward to reading more of her novels.
B004P8JPS6|2.0|Guess I'm just not a fan.  Thought it was very thin as far as plot and characters.  A formula novel.  Not for me.
B002MQYOFW|3.0|This book is a vert interesting book is about difficulties and is a very great story and I would recommend the book to a book lover and a suck err for adventure.
B006IDG2T6|5.0|I read it twice to internalize the arguments so I could reproduce the fantastic discussion with friends. I have recommended it to many.
B0015DROBO|3.0|This book I find to be a very slow read, hard to want to pick up and continue. I keep reading it because I'm hoping it gets better or maybe the ending is going to be spectacular.I have never read this author before and I don't think I will again.60% finished and still not impressed.
B00632HWOG|5.0|CAN CHECK EMAIL ANYWHERE ITS GREAT TO HAVE DON'T HAVE TO BE JUST AT HOME ON COMPUTER TO SEE MY MAIL.
B0071BGOJC|5.0|This book lives up to the greatness of the first novel, a smooth and interesting transition from book 1 and a fascinating look at WWII
B0068THAGY|2.0|Super 8 has good special effects and background music, and the kiddie actors put up decent performance -- but its ridiculous plot has four junior high schoolers saving the world! I mean, if the alien monster hadn't been impressed by Joe's moving spirituality at the end, he/she would probably have destroyed Ohio and the rest of the world, who knows? BTW, I love it when these alien breathe air and eat meat like you and me. How lovely. Yet they look so ugly, and why do they have to eat people for fun? Aside from the special effects, this is a hollow film devoid of anything meaningful.
B007IXWKUK|3.0|I skimmed through the last four chapters out of boredom just to see how it ended. Couldn't the author have used some new adjectives? Very little left to the imagination, but not in a good way.
B00AF6MF9I|3.0|Fun game, easy to play, good graphics and sound effects are a lot of fun. Can be slow at times waiting for builds.
B0029XFNAI|5.0|Have always loved this movie. When my DVD copy was ruined I was very glad to see this available at a great price. This one is my favorite of the remakes. I own the original as well!
0316228532|1.0|This is one of the worst books I have ever read.  I did complete it, hoping that at some point there would be at least one character I cared for.  In the end the only one, is a child that has very little to do with anything, more like an afterthought that she threw in.  DO NOT waste any money on this book.  I am sure it will abound at used book stores and should quickly be returned to libraries, be patient.  I love to read, and do so every night.  It has taken me months to finish this book.  It is so depressing, and shines a horrible light on humankind, I could only read a few pages at a time.  If you do choose to read this dark, depressing story, be prepared, it only gets worse.
B0091REZMW|4.0|Thus game is easy to grasp.  Each quest takes just a couple of minutes.  You don't have to spend money if you don't want to and are careful.  It's a fun way to relax.
B005LAII80|5.0|This movie was released with very little marketing push and as a result did not get fair treatment at the box office. In my area (dallas,TX), It was usually shown as the last feature at night for a few weeks after opening day. I admit I chose to see Looper, which by the way was pure trash. Not a good look for any movie. Anyway fast forward several more weeks and its at the dollar movies. So I packed up the wife and although we were cautiously optimistic, we were prepared to be underwhelmed. Was I pleasantly suprised. This Dredd has ZERO similarities to the Sly Stallone flick in 1995. The tone was perfect and the writing was believable. This didnt stray much from the source material and it paid off. Karl Urban is a fantastic actor who doesnt get enough credit I think. He is a bit of a chameleon with his roles. While not a masterpiece, it is definitely a must see.<br />FYI: I saw it 2D at the theatre but 3D at home and there isnt a problem with either version. The special effects are not over the top but work effectively.
B0084AYLK8|5.0|One of the great books of all time. Thomas Hardy is/was a master.<br />I can't find seven more words so I will end now.
B002M9WW30|5.0|Amazing box set that isnt to bulky and has the Rocky Movies so this was one hell of a deal!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Instantly!  Instantly I was immersed in Hugh Howey's silo world of the future.  How an author can be so concise and descriptive at the same time is refreshing.  Without having to use long, drawn out paragraphs to describe the dark depths of silo life, Mr. Howey puts the reader in the silo...I could easily imagine the steel steps, hear the clanking of boots against the stairs, and see the round walls of the stairwell.  I have never read anything like this and loved the presentation of the Omnibus.  The reader gets a glimpse of silo life in the first book, but learns more with each book, always something new about this post-apocolyptic world.  I couldn't stop reading this, and would have to make myself put the darn thing down at 3 am.  Hugh Howey's follow-ups, First Shift and Second Shift, offer more of the same exciting writing.  Looking forward to more from this talented writer!!
B001DPHDCY|5.0|great movie! DVD arrived in perfect condition and quickly. This movie is awesome. I love the message, characters, and animation. I adore Dr. Suess!
B00846REIS|5.0|I couldn't put it down .I finished it in one day.Now on to read Reflected to you. Gideon is so understanding. I want a man like that.
B00004RF9B|5.0|One of my Favorite all time Science Fiction Movies !!!!!<br />Way ahead of it's time.<br />Love the DVD Format: Full Screen on one side of disc; Wide Screen on the other side !!!!!!!! (I Decide how I want to view it)<br />  STEREO !!!!!!
030759565X|5.0|I have been a follower of the blog for a long time and one of my favorite things about Deb's recipes is that I usually have the ingredients! (and they are DELICIOUS) I got this book for Christmas and I have been cooking like mad. Usually having a one year old kiddo keeps me too occupied to get myself together enough to make dinner after being at the office full time, but I am so enjoying these recipes I'm finding myself staying up late cooking!<br /><br />The book itself is beautiful. I love that there are so many great recipes for brunch! Also, so many of these dishes can stand alone as a meal - which I am all about, not too many side dishes coming out of my kitchen. I even have started using her pizza crust and I have been making homemade pizza for a very long time so it had to be pretty great for me to change my recipe :)<br /><br />Buy it. Give it as a gift. Enjoy!
B0055PGUYU|5.0|A good read. The book goes through many examples of how habits are heavily engrained into our lives and many times without our awareness of them. It is not necessarily a guide for erasing bad habits but it's a good start to understanding them so you can get on a track to modifying your habits into something good.
B003O86FMW|5.0|These trio of books are so awesome! I LOVE THEM SO MUCH! Read this book GUYS! You will love it!
B009A9EPLM|5.0|The item arrived in excellent condition.  My father thoroughly has enjoyed this gift.  An excellent score from a brilliant composer.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|its a great game, but I don't like that the sequel is separate. other than that I personally don't have any issues with it.
B000QXDED6|4.0|I was surprised that this disc arrived in a thin DVD case, not the standard sized plastic case.  I don't care about such things, personally, but it was a gift and some people like their cases to match.  I don't remember this being stipulated in the sales description.
B007SGM084|3.0|Loved the first book, and the first third of the second...  Great plot, with interesting characters, but then the erotic scenes just start saturating the reading.
B007NZQU72|4.0|Good for those who feel like they are the only ones.  Too much about therapy.  Most of us know that we are HSP.<br />It is helpful, though, and there are some great insights.
B009ERK1T0|5.0|Koi No Yokan is something a little different and a little the same from Deftones.  In my personal opinion this album does not offer as much &#34;depth&#34; as previous albums.  The beats, music and lyrics are a little more &#34;straight forward&#34; than previous releases.  There isn't as much melody and again, depth but, this album still rocks.  It's as if Steve found his heavy metal roots and just blasted them out over the tracks and asked the rest of the band to follow along.  All in all it's a great record but you are reading a review from a guy who's favorite 'Tones record is the self titled one....you know, the one that most fans don't like.  Deftones' Deftones album is the finest in rock music and it would be impossible for them to duplicate it.  I'm so glad they didn't try.  What we have been given with Koi No Yokan is more of a continuation of Saturday Night Wrist and if you ask me, that's not a bad thing at all...
B009YP9L7U|5.0|Love this book. One of those books you don't want to put down, wondering what is going to happen next.
B0063IH60K|4.0|Nice and easy time eater. It's easy to use and you don't have to use Wi-Fi to play at random level which is useful on a plane.
0765325950|1.0|I love this book, let me make that clear.  This book is a great conclusion to an amazing series.<br /><br />It is a shame that TOR and Mrs. Jordan decided to go with such an out dated publishing model however.<br /><br />This book is too heavy (and now this review is technically about the book...) to carry around and doesn't fit in my pocket, so I'm going to have to give it a 1 star due to its \\"packaging\\".  Great content though.
B00AKKTDJY|5.0|thus is hands down the most addictive game...my husband is also addicted. when I try to sleep I dream of this game.
B002JWD6AS|3.0|For a young adult stories Shiver rated as ok. It leaned a little on the obsessive love that Twilight did, if that's what you are looking for, supernatural love story, than it is a good book. I'm hooked on series novels right now and my main series has a year before the next book so these type of books are keeping me occupied.
B0076DELIG|5.0|An excellent mystery in true Harry Bosch fashion. I recommend it to lovers of excellent whodunnit detective novels. Another winner for Connelly.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|I LOVE THIS BOOK.  Google :)__::&&+: :)__::&&+: :)__::&&+: :)__::&&+: milk and some money for me to work with the public domain name of the yen.
0395389496|3.0|Our family loves this movie. I bought with the intention to add to our Christmas book collection. It has beautiful illustrations. Our children are still young ages 4,4 and 2 1/2. This book is too long to read to them now- but would be fine for an older elementary school age kid.
B00280LYIM|5.0|This book was amazing I read it in 2 days and am jumping in my seat super excited about the last book man I even read the Kane Chronicles already
B000QCS8TW|5.0|Excellent beginning to an excellent series!  Well written and researched, these will be a classics when the seventh is published.
B005CIWNJG|5.0|James Rollins books hit the same high points as Cussler and Rielly, and with the Devil's Colony he has achieved a tour de force, with numerous twists and blind ends.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|Acting, marvelous, costumery even better.<br /><br />A drama about good people working and trying.  WIth humor and historic items that are accurate and poignant<br /><br />Huzzah!
B002MQYOFW|2.0|One of the heart books I\\"'ve read in a while can't wait  to see the movie and start Bob two
1933865474|5.0|I have always enjoyed Bruce Timm's art, but this is phenomenal. He really captures the subtle beauty of the female form.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|marcia says this book is good enough to read again and again....Seriously, best series since i devoured the Sookie Stackhouse books.
B008OOYALE|5.0|I really enjoy the possibilities in this game. Sure, you can spend real money, and I may someday, but you can participate fully for free. I like the surprises in breeding new dragons and the animations.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This novel has it all. Love, romance, mystery, suspense, and a wild invigorating twist at the end. One of my favorite Nicholas Sparks books and a top favorite novel on my chart as of now. You've not only got to add this book to your to do reading list but bump it to the top!
B00AEFVRB2|5.0|Most filmmakers in this day and age can't even come close to making something as intense or audacious as \\"Killer Joe,\\" which is a marvelous, perverse blend of noir, thriller and black comedy, and at 77 years old, William Friedkin has bested them all. His direction is as electrifying and bold as it's been since the 1970s, and working with Tracy Letts' ferociously satiric script, he gives us the best film of last year. Stellar performances (most notably from Matthew McConaughey as the slick, patronizing, sadistic Joe Cooper), offbeat humor and a tense, brutal, disturbing and funny-as-all-hell ending make \\"Killer Joe\\" an instant cult classic.
B008FQ1O1K|4.0|A simple yet extraordinary story of the tragedies faced by three main characters. It brings to light the sensitive nature of time and how precious it really is. Mitch Albom doesn't fail in the way he portrays this theme. It is written in a way that one needs to keep turning the page and at same time reflecting on the intricate lessons on life. A lovely read. Would definitely recommend it.
B00914JWSW|5.0|Barbra Streisand has never disappointed me whether it was with an album or a movie. Her choice of songs for the last 30 years and however many vinyl albums and CD's I have owned categorized my life, my life experiences and have always touched my heart. Her song &#34;Memories&#34; was the means by which I managed to have a very good, close relationship with my ex-husband in the raising of my daughters after a heartbreaking divorce. Happily my kids don't have problems that require them to seek counseling over the messiness of the parting of our ways, my husband and I. Her choice of songs through the years have comforted me. Buy this album. Her rendition of &#34;I think it's going to rain today&#34; is unbelieveable. Can't get it out of my head. Made me look around for ways I can reach out and help folks more.
B009YQJ322|4.0|It's a Christopher Nolan-class improvement upon [[ASIN:1558908846 the previous Stallone version]], being significantly less cartoonish than [[ASIN:1906735875 the original source material]] as well.  Everything about the production design is far more realistic, although strangely present-day for a society that's a century in the future from us, such as the cars, the guns that aren't Lawgivers, the existence of a skateboard half-pipe in a couple of scenes, and Dredd's uniform being reminiscent of a SWAT cop with the various accouterments toned down.<br /><br />Parallels to [[ASIN:B008ULRY78 The Raid: Redemption]] have been invoked, but they're ancillary: what should've been a simple probie assessment for Cassandra Anderson turns into a day-long run-and-gun fight for survival when a suspicious death callout to the Peach Trees megablock, a 200-story skyscraper housing 75,000 people, attracts the attention of psychotic ex-prostitute-turned-drug-lord Madeline \\"Ma-Ma\\" Madrigal and she locks the place down in the hopes of killing them in order to protect her business.  The gunfights are devastating and occasionally done in slow-motion, and Dredd remains true to his [[ASIN:B002Z7FWBI Dirty Harry]] inspiration by keeping his voice as a low, breathy growl at all times.  Be advised that this most assuredly not for children.
B000I9X67W|2.0|The movies has no problems regarding shipping.  It actually arrived early!  Be careful if ordering and only seen the TBS edited version.  Has language you're little ones might not need to hear.
B00A9X9ORI|2.0|very stupid and confusing plot that I couldn't follow very well. I think Bruce has seen better days.  Watch something else
0934026157|5.0|This is a good book for anyone who wants to learn to weave.  I have a loom and I bought it lot learn more about weaving.  It is a very readable book and the price was right.
0761163808|3.0|Yes \\"Safari\\" is an amazing and beautiful book.<br />But I'm not sure of the audience. I don't think children brought up on high quality video and multi-media ebooks on iPads will be impressed for long before asking the question \\"What else does it do?\\"<br />Adults will appreciate the delightful text but it remains a coffee table book for conversation and for collectors.
B007MDB548|5.0|My little fairy princess absolutely loved this movie, especially in 3d.<br />Great story, we have been pleased with all the fairy movies.
B003O86FMW|3.0|Not as good as the first book but a necessity if you are going to read the trilogy.  Looking forward to book three.
B000784WMW|5.0|If you haven't seen this version of \\"Jane Eyre\\"--Why the heck not????? It is one of the best versions out there. And no, I do not think Timothy Dalton was too handsome to play Mr. Rochester. The ugliness of his soul lies on the inside, until Jane enters his life. If you don't cry when he is begging Jane to stay after their aborted wedding, there is no hope for you. An excellent cast all around. Would have liked to see more of Rosamund, the woman St. John loved--although there was just enough to show what a fool the man was. All in all my favorite verson of one of my favorite books.
B0026MOVO6|5.0|I love Whitney and this is her best see by far! My favorites, I Bow Out, Say Yes and Love is Standing By!
B009HELT3C|4.0|Typical Men in Black,.  Characters are atrocious.  Storyline is unbelievable for those of us not good with our imaginations.  Probaby they've made enough Men in Black movies.
B009VB97EY|1.0|Neither the acting or storyline were very good.  Guess you'd have to enjoy going to strip clubs to find the movie appealing.
B003MUOUI8|5.0|Award winning performances by Morgan Freeman and Matt Damon. It was very enjoyable and helpful to understand South Africa struggles.
B0097EWK3A|5.0|I downloaded the free version to check the game out first. Am so glad I did, quickly purchased it. Absolutely no regrets.  Great visuals, music that enhanced the experience, and a couple of scares all made for a great time!  A fun murder-mystery whodunit.  I knew early on the who, but catching the murderer and finding the kidnapped girl is what this game is all about.  Some ha-ha moments definitely abound as well as some, duh moments. I hooked my Kindle Fire HD to our TV so that my mother could watch and help, her response - &quot;You only paid how much?!&quot;  I am looking forward to the next one! Awesome job!
B00APUYN0I|4.0|Great music and dancing.  Storyline is typical however.  Teens and Twenties would enjoy this most likely.  A good rental movie.
B0084BMUFA|5.0|a Christmas Carol delivers  the message of what Christmas really means but also the importance of caring about others. love the story and certainly hope to be entranced by its magic for many years to come.
B007DVF5CC|4.0|Very enjoyable.  A little slower pace movie so you need to be in the mood for that. Helen Hunt and Scarlet Johanson are not the stars of the movie however.  The male actors steal the show at times.
0765325950|5.0|Finished the book during my lunch break and it was worth the wait.  It is rare to feel emotionally beaten and dragged thru a book but it was worth it.  I won't say anything about the story that will give it away for anyone who has yet to read it.  This book... Words have left me.  Anything I could say would spoil the impact of the ending.  Any fan of the Wheel of Time series or fantasy will love this book.  If you haven't read the series yet now is the time to start.  Push thru the slower books (I wont list them here because its all over the web which ones they are) and you will enjoy the roller coaster ride. :)
B0025VLEM0|5.0|Well it's a great movie and I wanted it added to our collection of blue-rays.  It was a super price too!
B0084B1T8Y|5.0|This takes me back to my childhood. I so loved Mowgli, and his adventures in the jungles of India. I originally disliked the Walt Disney version, as I believed that Mowgli lost all of his dignity, and honour, in it. I was also stirred by Rikki-Tikki-Tavi, the mongoose, and his epic battle with a pair of King Cobra's. And who could forget little Toomai of the Elephants!  Re-reading the Jungle Book as an adult, I enjoyed the final story &#34;Her Majesty's Servants&#34;, which portrayed Kipling's feeling about the tragedy of animals, forced to endure war waged by humans.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book was very real and beautiful. The characters and the romance will keep you wanting more and more. Loooove Holder!!
B003JTHXOK|4.0|I really liked this book, as I do most Nicholas Sparks books. I flew through it, and am very excited to see the movie, that comes out on Valentine's Day!
B009YP9L7U|4.0|I liked the story line. Would recommend to everyone who enjoys fairytale romance with a steamy side of love making.
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|I couldn't put it down, it was so hard to put it down when i had to go to work, but as soon as I came home, I picked it right back up. There was never a dull moment, It's one of those books that keeps you on your feet. It's like you have to turn the page to see what happens next.
B0015DROBO|4.0|The book started out very slowly, and it was just talking about the financial world, at first.  Wordy!  But then it turned into a mystery worthy of Agatha Christie, but with a serial killer...it had a satisfying ending.  Interesting protagonists!<br /><br />I want to read the rest of the trilogy!
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|This game is well-designed and fun to play. It's just the right amount of challenge. This free game is the one I play the most.
B000SC245E|2.0|only printed 3000- 5000 letters only 2% left, not good. I would not purchase again. This was rebuilt I would avoid.
B005URRCUY|5.0|Though I bought the &#34;album&#34; for one song, the others grew on me quickly and I now have 4 favorites from the CD.  I can't help but crank it up and sing loudly.
B002N44XSG|5.0|Best book ever since I read the Mark of Athena. The book was awesome and I am pretty sure I will never read a better book.
B008AK8FHM|4.0|Great book, makes you think. Holds your interest and hopes that this is what people have to look forward too.
B000002LMK|5.0|a great song, and typical of the music on this CD. most endings are lengthy feedback extravaganzas that fit each song perfectly. the sweet harmonies from Billy and Ralphie balance out the muck and mire from the guitars of Pancho and Neil. if you've read Neil's book &#34;Waging Heavy Peace&#34;, you know he's been playing &#34;Farmer John&#34; since his very first band. The only live song, &#34;Mother Earth&#34;, is a beautiful ending to a great set.
B005NFJAZS|5.0|I'm not into old movies at all, but my daughter saw this at school and fell in love with it, and after I watched it, I fell in love with it, too. It's very old-fashioned and sometimes makes me shake my head at the attitudes (toward women, for instance), but is very fun and has great music! Also, Shirley Jones plays a forward-thinking independent-minded woman. I think what attracts me to the movie is a combination of the plot, the music and the early 1960s interpretation of the early 1900s midwest U.S., which I find fascinating to observe and ponder.
B004YM6JLO|5.0|started watching all the series and hasn't stopped.  My niece has stayed up hours watching and was very please with the collection.
B0084AZXKK|5.0|I really enjoyed this book. If you have not read it I recommend doing so. Can not beat the price.
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|This is a fantastic book, I am already reading the second and looking forward to the third in the series!
B0096DZKZC|4.0|I have this game on PlayStation and it is exactly the same. the controls are pretty goo if slightly laggy on the joysick. a really good mobile version of a great game. I got it on sale for .99 and I don't think I'd pay 6.99 for it.
B009UX2YAC|2.0|very boring just a big fat slap in the face of  temple run there's nothing differe&ntilde;t but the setting it is like they copy the pasted it....so I would not get it.!!!!!!!$$$$$$*******%%%&amp;%%&amp;&lt;3&lt;3&lt;3
B00AKL1XPU|4.0|Very nice graphics ans is pretty easy to play... i do recommend this app and it runs perfectly on the kkndle fire.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|I would recommend this book to anyone who loves! It is a quick read...read it in a day and a half...couldn't put it down!  Fantastic ending!
B004FRX0MY|3.0|I love the Amazon Cloud service, and I store my entire music library on it.  Unfortunately, my experience with it has been inconsistent and disappointing.  I have an iPhone, and if I use the app on there for more than about 5 minutes, it locks up my phone, and it can take a full minute for it to respond.  I also have a Samsung Galaxy Tab, and for some reason, Amazon decided to eliminate the ability to browse my library by genre.  That might not seem like a big deal for some people, but it's huge for me.  Really makes the app useless unless I know exactly what I want to listen to.  I realize there are competition issues between Amazon and Apple, and Amazon and Google, but these inconsistencies and poor performance is a real let-down from Amazon.
B006LSZECO|1.0|All these twists and turns and complicated issues all wrapped abruptly in a pretty little bow. I'd like the time back I wasted reading this.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|what can I say about this show, except that it captivates. It keeps me wanting for more. It is a must-watch!!!
B001AQR3E4|5.0|This is a very good movie and maybe even the best vampire movie.  Thoroughly enjoyed it and would recommend if you are into the vampire thing.
B00AECDDYY|5.0|Very good game. It's very hard to put down once you start playing. Starts out easy then gets harder. Very addictive.
B009LL4LMM|3.0|very cute colorful game. a bit too easy for me, seems like it was made more for kids than adults.
B007WFTFG6|5.0|I need to ask my son who is 3 yrs old who is using it. Looks like he loves it along with his Angry Bird, bricks & so on....
B004SIIBGU|5.0|best place to buy things and good communication fast shippment friendly people. I would recommend this to anyone. excellent prices
B000I9X53W|5.0|just love dustin's flexible/ adept acting ability and think jessica is da bomb!  this movie is a great message to both men and women in terms of identity and relationships.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|Ever since I got my kindle fire hd I had this app and it helps me to tell how much battery  I have
B005I6EU7U|5.0|The case is even prettier in person! Surprisingly the elastics hold the kindle perfectly (and snugly) in place. I love the look and feel of it, and especially love that I can fold the front back so I can read one-handed if I want. It's definitely a good value and does its job well!
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|I could not put this book down! It was beautifully written!! I can't wait until the next book comes out in April!!! :]

B005LAIIA8|4.0|A love / hate relationship has always existed between Tim Burton and critics. Ever since \\"Pee-Wee's Big Adventure\\" hit screens in 1985, the renowned director / producer / writer is constantly put under a microscope over every project he's attached to. He's been praised for triumphs like \\"The Nightmare Before Christmas\\" and ridiculed for heavily panned for movies such as the \\"Planet of the Apes\\" remake. \\"Frankenweenie\\" should be added to his list of successes.<br /><br />Vincent is a loner who loves making homemade movies with his dog and best friend Sparky. After Sparky is hit by a car and killed, the boy is distraught and lonely. Thanks to his science teacher, Vincent is shown how to re-animate dead tissue and uses it to bring Sparky back from the dead. Things get out of control when the other students in class start bringing their pets back to life with less successful results.<br /><br />I've always liked Burton's movies. I loved \\"Dark Shadows,\\" \\"Planet of the Apes,\\" and all of the other films he's been involved with throughout his entire career. Looking through his filmography, I can't locate a single movie I hated or consider unwatchable. The man has a wonderfully dark sense of humor and a great admiration of cinema history, which he shows off through \\"Frankenweenie.\\"<br /><br />\\"Frankenweenie\\" is classic Tim Burton at his best. It has crazy characters with the looks to match. A couple of them are patterned and named after classic horror actors and characters like Vincent Price, Boris Karloff, Elsa Lanchester, Igor, and others. The entire movie serves as a beautiful homage to Universal and Hammer horror. I smiled in delight when Vincent's parents are cuddled on the couch watching \\"Horror of Dracula\\" with Christopher Lee.<br /><br />My only complaint with \\"Frankenweenie\\" is it's too clean for what it's trying to emulate. This is even more evident when the film is seen in high-definition. A movie that celebrates the monsters of yesteryear would have been more effective if they had added some artificial film scratches and grain to give it an aged \\"retro\\" look.<br /><br />Danny Elfman's musical score for the film brilliantly blends his trademark orchestration with splashes of what you would expect to hear in movies like \\"Bride of Frankenstein\\" or \\"Dracula.\\"<br /><br />Anyone who enjoyed \\"The Nightmare Before Christmas,\\" \\"Corpse Bride,\\" \\"Coraline,\\" or \\"James and the Giant Peach\\" will embrace \\"Frankenweenie.\\" It's an elegant tribute to the classic horror films of the 1930s, 1940s, and 1950s that will entertain children and their parents. It's definitely a return to form for Tim Burton. This is a successful culmination of what was obviously a 28-year labor of love for the eccentric filmmaker.ective if they had added some artificial film scratches and grain to give it an aged \\"retro\\" look.<br /><br />Danny Elfman's musical score for the film brilliantly blends his trademark orchestration with splashes of what you would expect to hear in movies like \\"Bride of Frankenstein\\" or \\"Dracula.\\"<br /><br />Anyone who enjoyed \\"The Nightmare Before Christmas,\\" \\"Corpse Bride,\\" \\"Coraline,\\" or \\"James and the Giant Peach\\" will embrace \\"Frankenweenie.\\" It's an elegant tribute to the classic horror films of the 1930s, 1940s, and 1950s that will entertain children and their parents.

B007TNS6JI|5.0|This is a game with great visuals , decent controls, and a nice powerup system. I am not a huge fan of paying to upgrade, but the good news is you don&quot;t have to use it.You can actually grind your way there. Big download (430 MB) but looks great on the Kindle tablet.
1616284382|5.0|What a fabulous, well illustrated, colorful tribute to the Disney classic.  In the words of Disney - &#34;a good show&#34;, tremendous depth, tons of pictures and very high quality book.
B0042VJ1PI|4.0|Feels like your reading the tv series which is as it should be can't wait till the next book comes out
B004SJ3AXI|2.0|Was unable to download game file, so was not able to install. Was not able to find support to fix problem.
B004J4WLB4|4.0|The Language of Flowers engaged me on the first page and kept me interested throughout.  I cared about the characters.  I honestly did not know that there was a &#34;language of Flowers&#34;, other than roses!!.  It's always nice to learn something new when reading a novel.  I highly recommend this book.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I love the whole series of the books. When i read these i fall into another realm. The characters are so alive and when i ended the trilogy i was sad because i felt lost. I have re read all of the books more than 20 times. So i say I'd give them more than 10 stars .
B00A8ECU24|2.0|The game is cute but I refuse to be forced to buy my way thru the game. Also my friends social feature barely works and friends are required to beat the game. I can't gift to a friend's iPad from my kindle but she can gift to me. I would rather pay 2 dollars to download a game that worked and was otherwise free than a free game that doesn't and needs a lot of money to beat.

B008LC8TJI|4.0|I love this CD.  Another CD of fun, boppin' music from a great band. Keep up the good work guys!
B00A6N8F4Y|1.0|I knew going in that Oliver Stone likes to make \\"edgy\\" but never did I expect this. Our narrator (Lively) is a slut who's in a polygamous relationship with two guys who sell drugs. Excuse me, the \\"best weed in California.\\" One is a former Navy SEAL (Kitsch) the other is a botany major who makes the \\"best weed in California.\\" Salma Hayek and her drug ring offer to partner with them to learn their methods and the boys decide to liquidate their ill-gotten gains and leave. Only Salma Hayek decides to kidnap the slut instead. So begins a long tale of depravity that also involves Travolta as a DEA agent. No character can be considered a good person in any way, shape or form. Even the Botany guy becomes a murderer. The fact that it's beautifully shot by Stone changes none of that. I left hating all of them.
B00899F0G8|4.0|I've liked this show ever since I watched the first season and then by the time the second was over I knew I couldn't wait for the third.  When I saw that amazon offered this season on instant video I knew I had to have it!
B002U3CCF6|5.0|I really enjoyed this book. The subject was a bit grim, 2 murdered girls & the effects of bad mothering but it was easy to read and hard to put down. I'll be seeking out more of Gillian flynns books.
B006AX6ONI|4.0|I like the ebook so far.  It is an easy read and very interesting.  Cuban demonstrates how hard work pays off.
B008GAXUGW|5.0|I hesitated buying this box. Did I really need 37 CDs of Boccherini's music? I had absolutely no idea how incredibly beautiful his music is. I started out this morning listening to the Opus 11 String Quintets. This includes the famous minuet and trio from Opus 11 No 5, but the other music clearly is also worth listening to. This music brings joy to your heart. The sound of the gut strings on the period instruments is well recorded.I have listened to four CDs of these string quintets this morning and it is clear the box is worth every cent I paid. If your not convinced try Volume 2 in La Magnifica Communita's recording of the Opus 11 String Quintet. Two discs very well priced.
B004H1V5RU|3.0|This ball is really hard.  Even for my husband to do.  Very complicated.  I would suggest it for kids.  It is too hard and frustrating.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|This App keeps me coming back for more, and hard to put down. You can lose track of time real quick.

0316212377|5.0|Looking forward to reading this novel from Iain Banks.  When you find an author you like, you look for more new novels by them.
B004EBT5CU|5.0|I gave it as a gift.  My friend just loved it.  She said the sound was great.  I recommend it to others.
B004LWZWGK|4.0|You've seen enough reviews about the movie - it's great. This UltraViolet &#34;digital&#34; version is terrible. I think it was pretty rotten of  them to switch digital distribution with the last film.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Kept hearing friends talk about this show so decided to give it a shot over the holiday season. So glad I did, this is a great show and can't wait for it to start back up.

B007IXWKUK|5.0|I'm addicted, can't stop, won't stop til there are no more. These books are so amazing. I wish there could be a movie as well.
1441748628|5.0|My husband and I listen to the whole series on audible since we are truck drivers  I have to say that it made my 10 hours go by fast and I found myself not wanting to shut it off to sleep. The narrator just makes listening all the better,she's awesome. Can't wait to get the rest of the series as well as the world series . thank you for such great stories. I just love all the characters. One more thing, so for those who've read the books and say Kat is boring, you don't know what your saying finish the series before making that type of comment. Enough said thank you again [[ASIN:0061245089 Halfway to the Grave (Night Huntress, Book 1)]]

B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I loved this book.  I was super excited to read this after reading Slamed and Point of Retreat.  and i was not disappointed.  I read this stright through and never had the urge to flip ahead to see what would happen as I was reading it.  That is saying something because I do that with most books that I read.  Hold was a great guy and Sky was really a strong Girl.  I am sure that I re-read this story again.
0545265355|5.0|I bought these for my son for Christmas.  I think it is the one present he was most excited about. He can't seem to put the books down.  They were a great price for the box set and I got them fast.
B009MO5G90|2.0|exspected better, we didn't need the 10 minute flash back. I'm sure its fan base knows the story and where its going without a waste of time. The 3D  didn't live up to the hype...seemed low budget to me. I've seen better.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|I had a credit in my Amazon account so I was looking for a cheap book to add to my Kindle when I stumbled across 'Hopeless'.  For only $3.99, I figured 'what the heck'.  Yes, the two main characters are seniors in high school, but this isn't your usual cheesy high school romance book.  I feel like the author took her time developing the characters and the story line.  A lot of times with books of this genre, I feel like the author rushes and it just ends up being a big disappointment.<br />I read this book in 2 days!  Yes, I'm a 30-something mom of 3, but I really enjoyed reading the book.  Once I got to a certain point, I just couldn't even put it down.  I stayed up late last night just to finish the last third of the book.  And yes the main characters are in high school, but I felt like I kept forgetting they were only 17/18 years old.  The book does touch on a very grownup/mature issue, and the main character (Sky) seems so much more mature.  By the end of the book, when everything is revealed, you have been brought on such a roller coaster of emotions.  You can't help but root for Sky & Holder to make it thru everything that is revealed.<br />I won't give away anything (a bunch of other reviews did) but if you are thinking about getting this book... definitely get it!!
B009JBZH54|3.0|Nothing that great ,too predictable,especially the ending. They gave it away in the beginning of the movie, no need to sit thru the rest.
B005LAII1C|1.0|It was a waste of money. Just not funny, and could had been better without the vulger language. I exspected better from Seth McFarlene. Let's see what he does with the Academy Awards show.
030758836X|5.0|I really enjoyed this book even though it is completely different from the types of books I usually read. It kept my interest the entire time and despite the many reviews complaining about the ending, I thought that it was creative.  It was an unexpected ending and I always appreciate that.  I think the author left it open for a sequel.  Overall, I enjoyed the read. I found it hard to put down and thought she did a great job with character development.
B004A8ZX2I|5.0|I found found this to be one of his best performaces ever. Great story line which was fun to watch and kept you guessing thru out . Excellent all around.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|Lost my original Kindle Fire charger and ordered this as a replacement. This is a high quality cable, very sturdy and fits well into the micro-usb port on Kindle Fire. Since i didnt buy the adapter I used the usb adapter from Iphone and it works perfectly with this cable to fully charge my Kindle in less than 2 hours. I would recommend for the price, with cables you get what you pay for and this is a good bargain.
B006LSZECO|1.0|All I can say is, don't waste your time.  It took a while to get into the story and then the end was horrible.  How in the world did this book make it onto the NY Times Best Seller list?
B0016J81B4|5.0|Bought these for my husband, he loves them  (lives in them..)  the description is right on and sizing chart perfect fit.
B007LNJ4YW|4.0|A really enjoyable, yet dark, introspective album, full of Cocteau Twins's formula of beautiful vocals, noisy sheets of guitar sounds.  LeGrand's vocals are more rich than Elisabeth Fraser's, the lyrics make more sense, and the album seems to grow with repeated listenings.<br /><br />Updating a few months later, I still like this record, and reinforce all the previous points! Totally worth it.
B005Q1W10A|5.0|As a follower of the PBS specials of Downton Abbey, I shopped for my own copies of season 1 and 2.  I love the series and found both movies cheaper here and the free shipping made it easy to purchase.....thanks, Amazon for the careful packing and timely delivery.
B006LSZECO|4.0|I liked the book.  I did not like theending.  I would recommend this to my friends.<br /><br />Review by Susan Dorrance
B009YP9L7U|5.0|This was a fun read for romance lovers. Thick with emotions and thin on complicated plot lines. Waking Up Married is completely and unapologetically all about the romance.
B004EPYZSU|5.0|Great movie! A strange combination: Cowboys and Aliens. Very well acted out too. The special affects were good, and not over done. The fight scenes were exciting and kept me on the edge of my seat. Enjoy!
B007ZGBZHE|5.0|Thoroughly enjoyed this fantastic book that pulls all the previous books together.  Looking forward to the next intriguing book to find out more about Constance's child.

B00005O3VC|5.0|This is Monty Python's coup de le gras.  A must see for anyone interested in English humor.  Decent picture and sound.
B008A1TIOK|5.0|Vivaldi's Four Seasons is quite popular, justifiably so, because if ever there was a perfect piece of classical music, this is it.<br /><br />But honestly now, how many times have we heard this piece?  Every day, if not every hour, there is some classical radio station, somewhere in the world, that is playing this piece. And for all the scores of versions, some with contemporary instruments, others with modern instruments; some with a small chamber ensemble, others with a symphony orchestra; some with electronic moog synthesizers, some with a capella voices, jazz versions, rock versions, reggae versions, basa nova versions, for all I know, a hip-hop version, you name it, -- doesn't in the end it all sound the same?<br /><br />Well, not this rendition. This is not a deconstruction of the Vivaldi piece. A deconstruction is taking the music, tearing it into pieces, throwing them up in the air and putting them back together in whatever order they happened to fall.<br /><br />Richter's version, on the other hand, is a recomposition. He has taken the essence of Vivaldi's music and put it into a musical style that post-modern musical ears are familiar with and can understand. The music is recognizable to the original, and it possesses similar musical themes and tempi. What is gone is the penchant for repetition and the ridged conformity to style and counterpoint which is so common to Baroque music. Imagine if Vivaldi lived today and wrote this musical piece -- not as jazz, rock, or a capella, but as a post-modern classical music piece, but as a modern classical composition:  this is how it would sound.<br /><br />The result is marvelous and pleasing to the ears. Richter succeeds in accomplishing his recomposition.<br /><br />If you like this reviewer has heard the Four Seasons a million times and would like to hear a version which is truly different but the same, this is your choice.
B00APUQRPC|5.0|A bit predictable but a very good story line and as always Clint does not disappoint.  Good Movie moved along well.
B006R8GK2Q|5.0|Really fun game. Not too many mini games, but loaded with hidden object scenes.  Highly recommended for anyone who likes hidden objects.

B000OZ0NXA|4.0|This was the first Jack Reacher novel I read.  It was a good and fast paced story, but it takes a llittle while to adjust to Reacher's level of violence.  I will read more of the series.
B00005BKZJ|5.0|This is a little gem of a movie with an unusual story line and a more unusual setting.  The music is haunting and memorable.
B0096HIEE2|1.0|The story content was very weak.  Nice looking bodies with the foulest mouthes I ever heard.  I would recommend it to NO ONE, I'm sorry I bought it should have rented it.  Only thing good I didn't waste the money by going to the movie.  I most likely would have walked out!!!
B003F3NEBG|5.0|This is by far the best of the adaptations of Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice.  This is one of those movies that can be watched over and over again without it getting tiresome.
B000JIHP88|1.0|This is by far the WORST crib mobile I have ever had! (As a NICU RN I have worked with many babies who had crib mobiles.) This is my 2nd mobile of this make and model. The 1st, and now the 2nd, do not work! I followed the directions to the 'T'...and the music sounds as if it is dying...and the motor worked for all of 2 seconds (with both #1 and #2)! Now on my 2nd mobile (bc I returned the 1st)...and this mobile does not even work..AT ALL! Brand new batteries...and the mobile will not function! No music! No motor function! The same batteries work in the cradle swing... I am sending this mobile back and never purchasing another product from Fisher-Price! My daughter is 3 months old and we are on our 2nd FP cradle swing...and 2 mobiles later... I am D O N E with FP! FP needs to improve on product quality...to say the least!!!

0241951453|5.0|I love the classic look of this book - the size and feel was just right. Like a little black dress.
B005S9EJ46|5.0|We enjoyed this movie, it had a good story line, with twist and turns in the plot. It will make you cry and laugh, as it deals with life situations. It has a satisfying ending, but it is a movie you can watch over again to pick up the pieces you may have missed first time around.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I loved reading this book. In fact, it got me hooked! It was one surprise after another and I couldn't put it down. I would highly recommend this book.
B008QTVNUI|5.0|Just a great show! I recommend to anyone who wants a mystery action suspense thriller. I look forward to seeing season 2
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I will say that I'm the person who \\"doesn't cry when reading a book\\".... or at least until I read this book. I was sobbing while reading this on a plane ride. I've read books that have depressing or sad moments but none that have made me cry. I loved it.
B009GED3HS|5.0|Since me and my husband are the same age as the gang we really enjoy it. Also it is amazing to see that relationships and jokes are cross cultural .
B007SGLZP8|3.0|The Racketeer seemed contrived and not realistic in the last couple of chapters not one of Grisham's<br />best efforts.  I think he is &#34;mailing it in&#34; to get a pay check in this novel.

B005UPOAT2|5.0|love this movie one of my faves. i cant get enough of this movie. i love the atmosphere and the cast.
B000SEGUDE|5.0|I decided to read this book prior to watching the movie.  I enjoyed it immensely and have encouraged my friends and family to read it.  This book is definitely isn't for everyone. I only recommended it to people I knew enjoyed out of the box concepts and storylines that weren't concrete.  A very worthwhile read for those who enjoy a journey written by an excellent storyteller
B00AE2J5HI|2.0|It was a slow paced movie for me. Something that takes a while to warm up to. Just was not what i expected ...AT ALL!!
B001OQCV6A|4.0|There are a few points that are different than the books, but I'd say overall it was entertaining and worth the money.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|Great app, you can choose the sound of course but also make it so you must solve a math problem to snooze. And change the difficulty of the problem. Also make it increase by one problem you have to solve every time you snooze, and much more. Super customizable and the math problems are set to medium difficulty for me, and its very efficient. When I first wake up, fairly simple problems are slightly difficult, so when I keep getting it wrong I have to really think, and this wakes me up a lot better, and keeps me from falling back asleep. Brings me to reality quicker so I realize I need to wake up to accomplish this task rather than just falling back asleep because it's what feels best. This app will make sure you wake up, if you let it. Settings are all up to you, I'd recommend this to everyone.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|Me Before You is an absolutely stunning love story and so much more than that. I could not put it down, I was so drawn in by the writing, the characters and their story. Will and Lou still haunt me (in a good way) and it's been days since I finished reading the book. Even hearing from Camilla, Steven, Nate and Treena helped with understanding the so many different POVs and the whys of some of their actions. It's not an easy subject to digest but truly done justice through the beautifully crafted words by Jojo Moyes.
B007TK77QE|5.0|As a fan of the Harry Potter Books I was motivated to discover whether J K Rowling could captivate me in a new formate.<br />An inability to put the book down ... the desire to read just one more page, one more paragraph, one more ...<br />Job done ! &#34;The Casual Vacancy&#34; held my interest and I completed the book faster than I thought possible.
B003MVJG8Q|1.0|I ordered this so that my backup drive could run quickly.  I installed it in an available PCI Express slot but Windows 7 never recognized it and did not install the driver.  I found the driver online and downloaded it but it never installed properly and Windows 7 64 bit OS never recognized it and it would not work.  I kept getting an error message when trying to use the installed software saying that the USB 3.0 driver was not installed!  What a hassle so I sent it back and got a refund.
B0083ZBW2Y|4.0|I think that this is a great book.  I like how it is detailed but not so detailed that it gets really boring.

B008FYZIVY|5.0|I watched all of the DVDs in this package twice in one week to prepare for the start of season 3. It was perfect for catching up and I'll probably buy seasons 3 and 4.
B007SGLZP8|3.0|If you are looking for on of his courtroom filled novels this is not the book for you. Granted it is a good story with many twists and turns its not his &#34;normal&#34; type of story. However if you just genuinely like the guy as a writer you will enjoy it!

B009RI4FRU|5.0|If you like Wes Anderson movies, you will like this. When I first saw it I didn't know it was Wes Anderson but I recognized the style immediately. It has well-known actors who play out the story in a compelling and comedic fashion. It's a fun, light-hearted film that still manages a subtle focus on interesting and controversial topics.

1419705849|4.0|The Third Wheel was a funny addition to the Diary of a Wimpy Kid series. I got it for Christmas and I literally read it in an hour. I re-read it time after time. Greg's hilarious (mis)adventures made this book so funny. My brother also read it in two days once I had finished it (twice).
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This is one of the best books I have read. I read it within 3 days. I go so lost in it and I could feel myself actually being the character it was that good :-)
0765325950|1.0|I think this is a terrible decision.  I know that eventually i personally will buy both e-book and hardback.  However what about all our fellow fans, service members, and students overseas? Alot of military members might only have access to a e-book version due to space constraints and shipping!!!<br /><br />Shame on you Harriet!<br /><br />Let me post an Addendum then...<br /><br />As you can see on my post, i am a -Amazon Verified Purchase- I did buy the book, i also took a day off work so i could complete the book before the intraweb started publishing spoilers.<br /><br />My copy of \\"A Memory of Light\\" is substandard... i expect more for a initial release hard bound edition. The spine was already cracked when i opened the amazon box. Multiple pages have stains on them from some form of liquid or ink spill. Many of the pages have a haze of ink dots(look like dirty paper) that appear to be caused by a improperly cleaned printer? Very irritating on the eyes.<br /><br />Probably would have given the book a 2star rating without the added insult of not being able to purchase a E-book copy to finish my collection! I have them all on e-book and Hardbound copies. Ive considered contacting amazon to replace this copy! Quality of hardbound books as degraded from when i bought my first copy of \\"Eye of the World\\" in the early 90's.

B008I3QZKU|5.0|I won't break down the album critically but will only say that i didn't really like the last 2 Killers records but this one I find I keep coming back to and have some of the hooks and lyrics stuck in my head for days.  I can listen to pretty much the whole album and like the whole thing, reminds me of when i was a kid and listened to albums like that.  It's a rare album I feel that way about nowadays but this is one of them.

0385536828|5.0|-----------------------------------------------------------<br />\\"Sweet Tooth: A Novel\\"<br />by Ian McEwan<br />(Nan A. Talese, 2012)<br />-----------------------------------------------------------<br />NOTE: some spoilers below.<br />-----------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />In Ian McEwan's deft historical novel, modern-day readers are introduced to the drab decline of recessionary England during the early 1970s, brought on by social tensions between the old order and the global counterculture, the abrupt disruptions of the OPEC oil crisis, and an overall economic malaise that brought the giddiness of Swinging 'Sixties London back down to the old dreams deferred of the postwar era.<br /><br />McEwan's protagonist is an unlikely one for a modern author to pick to introduce us to this era: the book's first-person narrator is Serena Frome, a parson's daughter, solidly middle-class, and though restless and individualistic enough to pursue a college education (despite being a \\"girl\\") at heart a rather unimaginative and politically conservative. So much so, that when seeking work as a college graduate, she is recruited by and accepts a position with MI5 (the UK's version of the FBI and/or CIA). Dreaming of a Bond-like career in espionage, Serena instead gets a crappy desk job, alongside countless other young women whose talents are discounted by the patriarchal old-timers who run the agency. But she is surprised to find that she doesn't really care that much, that she simply enjoys being a cog in the machine, helping in her small way to prop up a political system that is under heavy social criticism, yet which she still believes in, albeit in a somewhat passive way.<br /><br />Indeed, Serena is a curiously unsympathetic character -- selfish, passive, strangely unreflective. At first, readers might ascribe this to an uncharitable view (on the author's part) of Tory conservatives in hippie-era England, but as the novel crests towards its climax, you start to realize that Serena is perhaps a little more unlikeable that you would have thought, and while you've been attracted to her and given her the benefit of the doubt for quite some time, you start to wonder why McEwen would devote himself in such depth to a young woman who turns out to be something of a pill.  The reason why, which provides the twister ending, is a delight, and may -- or may not -- redeem her in the end. Another strong outing from the author of \\"Atonement.\\" (DJ Joe Sixpack, ReadThatAgain book reviews)x, you start to realize that Serena is perhaps a little more unlikeable that you would have thought, and while you've been attracted to her and given her the benefit of the doubt for quite some time, you start to wonder why McEwen would devote himself in such depth to a young woman who turns out to be something of a pill.

B00065MDSQ|5.0|This a Great Product.... Only Issue was how long it took to get here... But the Product it self was wonderful
B005V2S7FW|4.0|It has a few quirks like unexplainable changes to saved site parameters, but overall it does what it perports to do.  I particularly like the fact that it works with all my devices.
B009O2XY12|3.0|I really like playing this game.  However, when you run out of &#34;lightening bolts&#34; which are required to play a game, you have to wait upwards of 20 minutes to get a new one added, OR if you are impatient, you can pay for gems to purchase them.  I would rather pay for the app in the begining instead of being asked to pay money every time to continue.  I guess the possitive is, I put the game down when I run out of bolts.  You only get 5, and on the harder levels you get rid of those quickly
B009GEFXLC|5.0|When you are driven to buy an episode because your DVR missed it and you want to see the follow-up.<br />This could be cheaper - then I'd just buy the whole season...but it came as advertised so no real complaints.
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|This is really an outstanding book about the air war in Europe, during World War II. It is a hard book to put down. It describes the savagery of war, and the occasional act of compassion and gallantry. From losing 60 bombers and 600 men in one mission over Germany to the Luftwaffe Pilot who refused to shoot down a badly damaged B-17, at the risk that he would be shot if the Gestapo ever found out about it. The fact that these two men actually met years after the end of the war, and became friends is something that is not a part of fiction and a testimony to the fact that all men are indeed brothers.
B001VIMCW4|4.0|Sean Connery has always been James Bond - the rest were British prats that were comical.<br />Not the rough and tumble killer in a refined suit.<br />Daniel pulls off Bond in spade.<br />This movie is better tan Casino Royale, but not as good as Skyfall.<br />He just keeps getting better.
B004UID2LC|4.0|Works well on my kindle fire. This was great in the beginning: downloaded over 500 songs and videos with this. For a while the app seemed to nit work, and I almost deleted it, but then just came back again.<br /><br />I also notice the cover art for all songs just shows up as the first one I downloaded. And.... it sometimes won't download certain videos.<br /><br />Also, maybe its just me, but there are about three options when downloading something (mp3, video, and ACC or something like that)  not really sure what the third option is.<br /><br />Overall, runs very well. Nice way to get free music.

B00AMBK6J2|2.0|Loved the movie somewhat predictable, but the picture quality was aweful, almost bad enough to not watch the movie at times.
B005HSG3U6|5.0|Love the thing.<br />Very functional.<br />Very good padding.<br />One minor thing.<br />The outside shell seem impossible to clean once stained.<br />Have tried soap and water, a magic scrub.<br />All to no avail.<br />Afraid to try more since plastics tend to dissolve.

From the minute this films opening credits end the action begins and do'es not stop until the ending credits begin one of the most action packed Bond films ever. The knife fight is superb and must have been coriografted by someone skilled in the art of knife fighting! Bond strikeing the inside of the upper arm & inside of the upper thigh are classic knife fighting targets!!

0385536828|4.0|I suppose this commentary is rendered somewhat in response to many readers who felt Sweet Tooth is a comparatively lightweight bakery product.<br /> An artist has a preeminent obligation to himself. Should he fulfill that commitment transcendently, the audience and critics are the bedazzled beneficiaries and the artist is heroically redefined. However, the better an artist, the more often he reinvents himself ,takes risks ,seeks new ways to indulge the many needs his talent requires him to indulge, often to the dismay of the public who yearn for another repeat of the last performance. We the readership develop expectations not unlike visiting our very favorite restaurant and ordering our favorite entree, disappointment is invertible. We tend to evaluate his work in comparison to previous laurel'd,classic successes for which we yearn.<br />  The cherished wordsmith to which I refer is a liquid, non-static talent who spins tales with authenticity and scholarly underpinning. Here he impresses me with his mood and that of civilization in the period he descriptively parenthesized;Britains1970's cold war M-15 spy apparatus. Despite Mr. McEwan's huge facility and his vaunted accolades, he is not out to hit a bases loaded home run with every swing of the bat.In this particular frame he is singles hitter merely trying to advance the runner. An artist operating in a casual mode, not seeking a masterpiece can be acutely enriching, have you ever seen Picasso's erotic sketches of the 1960's? This work can be seen as kind of shorthand slyly referring to a myriad of life experiences more highly evolved in previous novels.  Sweet Tooth is about an author and his amorous muse, what could be more universally applicable?. Their discourse inspires the creation of his prize winning 'novella' and such is Sweet Tooth itself; a seductive and tricky internalized reference. .McEwan is narrating his motives when not creating subterfuge of his own author'ly process. `Sweet Tooth is self-portraiture in as much as it tracks the rise of an undiscovered writer and his love, who is an obsessive reader(us?).She is embodied as the muse whom Mr McEwan lovingly evolves in every way from adolescence to conclusion. Sweet Tooth offers insights into his regrets, nostalgia, and other preoccupations including the arbitrary nature of success.
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|I love the low blue light and the Parthia easy to see numbers. The features are great also and it's very easy to use..
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Beautiful and tragic. Although not a very realistic portrayal of actual teenagers dealing with first love and death entertained. Still really liked it.
B004ZZS4CC|5.0|What an indomitable spirit this girl has!  Enduring all she did for 18 years, always thinking of others and now, not feeling sorry for herself but being a wonderful mother, daughter and friend to people she hasn't even met.  We can all learn something from her incredible journey through kidnapping, captivity and, finally, freedom.  It is so good to hear her positive attitude.
B0085KGGHI|5.0|I recommend thid DVD to any Muddy Waters or Rolling Stones fans, or anyone who appreciates great music. It is something to be viewed many times over.
B007AJFSJW|4.0|Great laymen's review, but now I want to go deeper. I wish Krugman would write a follow-up targeted towards laymen who can handle more graphs/data.
B00018TI5E|5.0|This CD deserves a lot more recognition than it generally receives.  I'm a huge fan of everything Frusciante releases, but, unlike most of his other releases, this is an album I'd recommend to anyone who likes rock n' roll.<br /><br />One thing that makes it great is the quality of the packaging and insert.  The insert is printed on really nice paper, not glossy and cheap like most inserts.  In contrast to the cover, which isn't my favorite, all the rest of the packaging and insert is attractive and elegant, through and through.  There's no obnoxious FBI warning, and the lyrics to every song are neatly handwritten in the insert.  The CD itself is beautiful, and has every track name written in his handwriting as well.<br /><br />As for the music, it's very passionate, interesting, and melodic.  The funk elements of early RHCP are absent here; instead, the orchestrations and songwriting are more along the lines of By The Way.  With Chad Smith on drums, and Josh Klinghoffer helping with keyboards, guitar and bass, this has a less indie feel than his other solo albums, which are less carefully produced, and more raw.  This release isn't very experimental, but it still has that raw passion that is characteristic of everything Frusciante does.  This particular album showcases the best of his vocal skills; he tuned everything more carefully, and spent more time and money on this than his other albums.  Jim Scott's mixing and mastering is exquisite as always.  The lyrics are poetic, and sometimes dark, but uplifting at other times.<br /><br />If you liked By The Way, you'll most likely love this album.  I recommend it above all his others, for anyone who is interested in beginning an exploration of the beauty that is John Frusciante solo.
B00AHSINKO|4.0|My husband and I laughed and shook our heads over the problems and solutions these two found.  Meryl Streep is always awesome and her husband portrayed the perfect grump old man who found something to smile about, again.
B008Y212PI|5.0|Another addition to the Flip Pix Art series -- lots of puzzles, very relaxing. Can't get enough of these puzzles.  Always look forward to the next addition to this entertaining series.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|It's long but well worth the read and would not have been as engaging if the author shortened the book. You need to read his first book in the triology first for this to have a meaningful impact.
0345803507|3.0|I have read more exciting books in my life. The story plot was insipid, and the sex was not that exciting.
B008MG1E4A|4.0|Enjoyed this book. Surprised with the amount of &#34;Ambien&#34; taken to help the Seals sleep while traveling long distances to their targets. Very interesting read. Happy they got this bastard, but disappointed in our president for taking all the credit. Hope the intel is not sitting in an evidence room somewhere!
0345803485|3.0|Insipid story line. Not exciting Atalanta. Highly overrated. The publicity guy for this series really did his job. I have read much more well crafted romance novels in my life.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|The graphics are very good and I enjoyed the game very much. The little monkey is very helpful when you are not able to reach things.  it's a great games for people who love mystery. I would highly recommend it to anyone..

B008X8QCTO|5.0|This game ha a very interesting storyline. The objects were hard enough to find but not so difficult that it was frustrating. There were other things going on as well which made the anecdotes fun. On casual mode the hints recharged quickly enough when you get stuck.

B00A6PD9I4|5.0|I chose 5 stars for this movie. It teaches girls that they can be who they want to be and also shows how important family is. I think every one would enjoy this movie!
6305428557|5.0|If you're a fan of Northern Exposure, you'll love this movie. You have to pay attention to the subltle comments and allow yourself to be carried away back to post WWI Wales. If your patient, you will fall in love with these characters. Grant is understated and vulnerable with a perfect cast of supporting &#34;characters&#34;.
B00ARAO720|5.0|This movie is action from the start to the end and its a &#34; Smart &#34; movie with plenty of characters .
B0044E9LW6|5.0|I only wish this recording came out years ago. An instant classic for any Dio fan or lover of 80's hard rock. And the best, it's live!
B00AYB0TOW|5.0|This movie deserves some high praise.  It was really well put together; directing, acting, tone, pace, effects, action, story.  It also deserved to bring in a lot more than it received at the box office and I sincerely hope there is enough financial boost in DVD sales, rentals, etc. to spur another movie.  Would hate for this potential franchise to be laid to rest before being properly judged by others outside of its fan base.  The movie certainly has a darker tone & is much more graphic than its Judge Dredd predecessor, starring Stallone, but pays better homage to the Dredd character and the world surrounding him.  Karl Urban did a fantastic job playing Dredd.  Casting of Olivia Thirlby & Lena Headey were excellent choices, as well as the casting of most others in the film.  I also enjoy that the movie ultimately focuses on the iconic Judge Dredd character & what he does best, JUDGE.  Dredd's helmet, uniform, & primary weapon were never left behind throughout the entire flick. The ferocity of this film, accompanied by its artistic style, also helps mold this movie into a tight, masterful production.<br /><br />The Dredd franchise MUST continue, less those who operate movie distribution channels be judged!!
B008AK8FHM|2.0|no proof of anything, just a dream , author more than anybody should realize this, if you need to read it get it at a library, don't waste your money
B007ZGBZHE|5.0|I am so happy that Preston and Child continue to write about the delightful Agent Pendergast!  As long as they keep the story going I am a happy reader.  As always they keep you guessing and a surprise is around every corner with characters that amaze and amuse you!
B000HKW7E0|3.0|It was very good and made me laugh and I enjoyed it except for the language.  I think Chevy Chase is very good.
B005LAIHCM|5.0|I just don't see why all the negative reviews?  I thought the movie was great.  I never saw the ending coming.  The actors were awesome and I will watch this movie over again many times.  Trust me.  There are a lot of movies that are not nearly as good as this one.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|its a great alarmist- clock. it eve. has timer and other fun functions. it really is the perfect alarm clock for heavy sleeper!

B006LSZECO|2.0|It was an interesting premise - well belabored - inconsequential ending - boring format. Can you tell I didn't like it? But I will say - you have to finish it.
B000SEIK2S|5.0|Perhaps my favorite thing about this books aside from the actual concepts presented and characters, was the style of the story where the protagonist's view of the current technologies is shrouded similarly to the readers.  As the story progresses, your own understanding of the science fiction expands.<br /><br />Great series as a whole and a tough one to put down once started.
B000A7DVR2|5.0|Question: What do you do for recreation?<br />The Dude: Oh, the usual. I bowl. Drive around. The occasional acid flashback.
B000FS9FCG|4.0|If you like to use your brain when you watch a movie, you will LOVE LOVE LOVE it. If you just want your explosions and then get the hell out, with everything explained and spelled out then this movie is not for you. Stick with Pirates of the Carib, Transformers, and GI Joe, those movies will do the thinking for you. Your brain on ideas vs. your brain on mindless entertainment.
0765325950|5.0|I guess I'll join the chorus of those upset by the lack of an ebook option.  Since I have to wait, I might as well get the book for free from the library.<br /><br />Update 4/2013:<br />Worth the wait!  Strong, satisfying finish to the series.
B00475AYJQ|5.0|It is just as good as the first book.  I can't wait for the next one. It can't some soon enough.

B000J2BRQU|4.0|For sure a movie for teens, but its was well directed and has good racing and some cool cars. very pop culture oriented, not as urban as that of the rest of the fast and furious series.
B0067EKY7M|5.0|One of the really neat movies that lives up to its hype. There is something for everyone in this one.

0446567337|5.0|\\"Dear John\\" starts like many other love stories: boy meets girl, they fall in love, boy is in the Army, girl finds someone else. Yes, it's beautiful, it's sincere, it's life-changing for John and Savannah - but hardly extraordinary. Yet, Dear John is not your average romance novel. Sparks writes an enticing book about love and the way it changes people, bringing out the best in them. John is an ordinary guy who has found the love of his life. Until Savannah leaves him for someone else, the depth and sincerity of John's feelings for her are remarkable but not unique. What really sets this romance apart is the strength he discovers to make the ultimate self sacrifice for the woman he loves. His noble gesture remains anonymous for everyone, including Savannah - and their story becomes more beautiful and at the same time heartbreaking. Although it's not a happily-ever-after story in a typical way, \\"Dear John\\" is bizarrely uplifting.

B006O6FK2W|2.0|I ordered this based on my sons reaction to the commercial and the decent reviews on amazon.  I am disappointed as it really does not do much.  I would think the &#34;bat&#34; would have a few more movable parts.  The back wings and the front guns do not move at all.  The sound effects only come from the firing from one of the guns.  So basically it can fire the included foam type batman and the 2 plastic rockets with limited sound and movable parts,  You can open the canopy and manually spin the lame propellers on the bottom - that is it for options.  I got this on amazon for 30 before Xmas.  It is now 20.  It is more like a 15-20 dollar toy - DO NOT spend anymore than that.  My son lost interest in it after 10 minutes.  Hello spring yard sale.
B0041KVZ1S|5.0|I felt that Let It Be was great as an almost live lP. I've Got A Feeling is such a strong song with its full power of sound. The version of Let It Be is so much better with the louder guitar lead in the middle and at the end. The way Get Back opens with some talk is cool and ends the same way. The opening riff on I Dig A Pony. The beautiful blend of strings on The Long And Winding Road. Two Of Us with the nod to The Everly Brothers. George's I Me Mine and For You Blue. The only thing I find wrong is the bad pressing. My copy had a little noise at the start of the record and you can see some marks on the lp. The music does sound very good. I bought Let It Be, Abbey Road and The White Album and they all had some kind of noise or dirt and dust on the records with some ruff edges also. There shouldn't be these problems on new records. My original copy of Let It Be sounds just as good and it is around forty two years old. I hope they make some better pressings, I won't buy any more albums untill they make better ones.

B007OWRBJK|2.0|before purchasing, read the bad reviews.  i liked the book at first but mostly because i was excited about reading the story of Pete Townsend told by Pete Townsend.  Little did I realize, he is not a great story teller.  i was disappointed half way thru, and probably wont finish reading it. one other reviewer used the word &#34;disjointed&#34; -- very good description.  The tale goes in all kinds of directions from paragraph to paragraph the entire subject changes. Deadpan without comedy. ??
B009SJ3GUK|1.0|I really enjoyed the first season, it was certainly a bit over the top but the story was creative and the characters interesting.  I have barely made it through 1.5 episodes of season 2 and am giving up.  This one seems as though it was done by a 12 year old.  In your face violence just for violence sake, no character development and a story line that jumps all over the place before it is even established.<br /><br />I don't care for reusing the same actors from the last series in different roles, it is distracting.  Over all this season looks to be a juvenile gore fest, a huge disappointment.
B000002J1S|5.0|This album is one of the classic rock operas of our (late Baby Boomers) generation. It is a little know piece by fans of Genesis except for the fans of early Genesis music.  The story that is told through fun and intriguing lyrics and the complexity of the music, place this piece in a true classical genre along with Philip Glass' Einstein on the Beach, 1000 Airplanes on the Roof and Monsters of Grace.  I actually got to see &#34;the lamb&#34; album live.  Peter Gabriel was brilliant! But he couldn't have done this without the rest of the band.  I lost all my vinyl albums in a flood years ago so to hear it after so much time was beyond words.  This is music to be savored and enjoyed in one sitting. I highly recommend this album to any audiophile who has an attention span longer than what is expected from listeners today.  Rael is Real!!

B007IK44CK|5.0|I have been a big fan of the MI franchise since the first movie released years ago. I personally found MI-II to be disappointing but the team delivered a fine film in MI-III. Well, Ghost Protocol, in my opinion, is the best in the MI franchise yet. Everything from the storyline, action sequences, comedy, cast, and overall production have outdone the earlier films.<br /><br />Ethan Hunt and his crew (a fine cast of Paula Patton, Simon Peg, and Jeremy Renner) are disavowed as the IMF seems pretty much shut down with allegations that they were behind an attack on the Kremlin. The team is out to reveal the truth and stop devastating acts on the part of the villain. The storyline is paced well, with hardly any dull moments. Yes the plot may seem a little unbelievable given its scale and the fact that only one person can orchestrate it all pretty much single-handedly, but that's what such films have been any way - great entertainment albeit with a slightly over the top plot. I view MI to be somewhat (very loosely) of a balance between some over-the-top Bond films (particularly those with Pierce Brosnan) and the hard-hitting Bourne series.<br /><br />The action sequences are the best I have seen so far. For Tom Cruise to actually hang down from the Bhurj Khalifa, admittedly with harnesses, is mind blowing. Most of the film crew refused to go into the room with the open windows since the sheer height made them sick. And for Tom Cruise to actually hang from harnesses outside the building at such a phenomenal height is unbelievable. Kudos to his gusto and nerves of steel.<br /><br />Jeremy Renner (huge fan of his) has delivered a great performance as an agent on Hunt's team. I really hope he is cast in the next mission as well. Benji (Simon Peg) is absolutely delightful and nicely balances the movie with his lighter moments.<br /><br />Overall the MI crew has delivered a fine film in Ghost Protocol. I hope they all come together for the next film in the series as well. Highly recommended film, great entertainment.recommended film, great entertainment.

B004LOMB2Q|4.0|GREAT SUBSTITUTE for OneNote but not quite as good...  I wish it synchronizes with SkyDrive because Evernote is s*** on Windows 8 metro and desktop and I would prefer to use Microsoft One Note  Also, there's a limit unless you want to pay...kind of a bummer.  Still pretty good though.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This book is so good! It's perfectly relatable for a high schooler, and you will fall in love with the main character
B009O07NDY|1.0|The hero theme of the Misty Moutains was in my head for days after seeing the film...I figured the soundtrack could be 31 crap tracks but have that  one and it'd be worth it...yet after listening through all 32 of them, I was disappointed that the full hero's theme which was in the film over and over again, was only a few seconds on the end of just one song!  The Eagles theme is also missing...<br /><br />So this is not really a \\"special edition\\" when it comes to music, just a fancy CD case (which is nice), and a 2-disk musical journey that threatens a climax to match the LOTR and never does.  This falls well short of what I expected from Howard Shore...and ironically the best track on this CD was not done by him \\"Song of the Lonely Mountain\\" by Neil Finn was probably the only one to make my cut for heading to the I-pod play list, very sad...I spent $18 for one song by Mr. Finn.

B008R9QAY6|5.0|ONE OF OPERA'S GREATEST FALSETTO FESTS!<br /><br />First performed by Simon Fowler in 1730, Leonardo Vinci's (1690-1730) 'Artaserse' deployed castratis as his heroines and heroes. This was necessitated by the fact that women were banned from Roman stages in the early 18th century.  Fortunately today it is not necessary to employ castrati because there is, in fact, an abundance of falsetto voices, some of whom are very fine as evidenced by the five men on this recording. We have to give some of the credit for this to singers of some years ago such as Alfred Deller, British countertenor, who was one of the first singers who used his voice soloistically which resulted in many other men with similar voices to appear and so it goes.<br /><br />There are some excellent reviews already listed explaining the opera and the plot etc.  I would prefer to comment on the singers and some of their respective arias.  Firstly the line-up and the number of arias are: Philippe Jaroussky (Artaserse) sings five arias; Max E. Cencic (Mandane,female) five arias and a duet; Daniel Behle (Artabano,tenor) five arias; Franco Fagioli (Arbace) six arias and a duet; Valer Barna-Sabadus (Semira, female) five arias; Yuriy Mynenko (Megabise) three arias.<br /><br />Some arias that I partiularly enjoyed, though all of them are worlthy of note, I give you five of my favorites: CD 1, track 7: Arbace (Fagioli)  \\"Fra cento affani\\" (Torn by endless troubles) in which Arbace reacts emotionally to his Father's(Artabano) evil plot; it is a Fast-Slow-Fast tempo and he dips down frequently into the chest voice.  CD 1, Track 11 Artaserse (Jaroussky) \\"Per pieta, bell'ido miu\\" (For pity my fair idol) a lovely aria in which he assures Semira of his love; this is Jaroussky at his best.  CD 11, Track 23 Semira (Barna Sabadus) \\"Torna innovente e poi\\" (When you appear innocent again), Semira's unsympathetic response to her brother's possible guilt and Sabadus gives us that drama with all its intensity.  CD 1 Track 25Mandane (Cencic) super fast amazingly sung aria \\"Dimmi che un empio sei\\" (Tell me you are a criminal), this is Mandane's love hate aria to Arbace, her lover.  And some of the most memorable listening is provided by the one duet which occurs in Act 111 track 15 between Arbace (Fagioli) ad Mandane (Cencic) which is so exciting and so perfectly sung it stuns the listener : \\"Tu vuoi ch'io viva o cara (You want me to live my beloved-Arbace) against  \\"Oh dio, che pena amara\\" (Oh God, what bitter sorrow-(Mandane)\\". However, one must not forget our lone tenor Daniel Behle, who sings his role with great skill and bravura, especially in his magnificently rendered aria: \\"Amalo e se al tuo sguardo\\" in which he reprimands Semira for not loving her husband enough. So much good stuff in this musical to enjoy!<br /><br />If I had to choose the overall perfect singer among all of these marvelous singers I would have to choose Cencic, but I am certain each of you would have your own favorite; after all that's what makes music in the end a personal experience: \\"MUSIC APPRECIATION IS CAUGHT NOT TAUGHT!\\"<br /><br />To discriminate between them from strictly an audible standpoint is not that easy because the voice range of each is similar as required by the score BUT the texture is what finally tells the tale, though it may take repeated listenings to identify all of them.  Is that important? I spent several hours of listening though I was quite familiar with all the voices except Mynenko and Behle, but he is a tenor so that's a 'no-brainer'.  I think it is somewhat important if you are into the story line but certainly not crucial as far as enjoying the recording because the music of Vinci is truly marvelous and all the singers perform magnificently.  My only thought was that Jaroussky's role which is male might have been exchanged with Cencic's female role but that's a minor comment.  I do think that the ending  which is mostly with a very brief chorus was somewhat anti-climactic; again a minor criticism.<br /><br />Let's hear some comments from experts:  Musicologist, Frederic Delamea: \\"Artaserse is a key work of baroque opera and the genius of Vinci is still too little known.  This Virgin Classic recording, offering vocal and orchestral forces of exceptional quality, allows us to rediscover a figure who, in the course of his brief career, was one of the brightest stars of dramma per musica.\\"<br /><br />French scholar and traveller Charles de Brosies, who 10 years after Vinci's death from poisoning wrote: \\"Vinci is the Lully of Italy; true, simple, natural, expressive, writing in this most beautiful uncontrived way for the voice.....\\"<br /><br />The Guardian, Tim Ashley (11/14/12):  \\"...the singing is epoch-making, above all from Fagioli, who seems to redefine the capabilities of the countertenor voice and take it beguilingly into territories new.  Listen to him and be seduced!\\"<br /><br />Package includes a 190 page booklet with information in English, French, German; Italian text translated into the same languages.
B007SPN5MA|5.0|I recently purchased Glen Hansard's latest cd, after reading mixed reviews. I have been a fan of his since Once, and saw The Swell Season in Dallas a few years ago.  I have the cd Strict Joy, with he and Marketa Irglova, and I thought it would remain my favorite.  After listening to this new one through twice, I must say this one is my new favorite! Most of the songs do appear to have been written as a result of the painful break-up between he and Ms. Irglova, or at least I am speculating it is she of whom he writes. The words of several of the songs are heartbreakingly beautiful.  Mr. Hansard has such a talent for writing and singing, in a raw, and open way. He has lived his life, and most probably had hard times, having left school at 13 to be a busker in Dublin. He now is older and undoubtedly wiser and more mature, and it is out of living and learning over the years that has allowed him to put down such beautiful music for the world to enjoy. Bravo Mr. Hansard!
1741797802|5.0|This was an extremely comprehensive guide book for India, great for quick survey trips to India and longer stays. Their recommendations were spot on and all were up to date.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|This was an extremely interesting book!!! Very thought-provoking....how far would you go to protect your child? Of course, as a teacher, I found myself disagreeing with the parents' choices, but then I found myself in the shoes of a parent. How far would I go? As I neared the end of the book, I was dying to find out what would happen, but I actually kept myself from reading it for long periods of time because I did not want it to end! And what a twist at the end! Did not see it coming! A great read!

B007HACDLK|5.0|This is my first Kindle book, but I long have enjoyed Flynn's work. Mitch Rapp is a classic character, similar to some of Tom Clancy's (Jack Ryan, John Clark) who clearly see right and wrong. Rapp's injury and rediscovery of himself is an interesting twist in the story. Great story and timely in dealing with issues of Pakistan and Afghanistan, inter-agency issues and intrigue. Great book!
0552166626|5.0|Mort is the story of a gangly young man who becomes Death's apprentice. If you are familiar with Discworld, you may know Death - tall guy, boney, wears a black cloak, often seen with a scythe and in the company of a white horse named Binky. He is the anthropomorphic personification of the ultimate and final reality - and he likes kittens.<br /><br />In this story, Death apparently wants an apprentice for two reasons. One is that he has an adopted daughter, Ysabell, whom he thinks could use some company. The backstory for this is vague, but it seems that Death either took pity on her or was simply curious after he `collected' her parents. It's hard to tell with him sometimes. He has a wonderfully odd way of looking at things.<br /><br />The other reason to have an apprentice is that he wants a break from the `duty.' This turns out less well than Death might have hoped. On his first solo mission to free souls from their mortal anchors, Mort does something wrong. He saves a young princess from the knife of the assassin fated to kill her, and this disrupts the interrelated web of causality and creates a cosmic paradox. The world thinks she's dead, but because of Mort's intervention, she's not, at least not from a biological perspective. This leads to complications.<br /><br />Like many of Pratchett's books, Mort is full of clever wordplay and philosophical humor. For example, at one point Mort says, \\"I've heard about boredom, but I've never had a chance to try it.\\" This cracks me up because it's dryly funny in the context of the story, but it also philosophically insightful, or at least I found it so. This book is filled with such little Easter eggs, little bits of prose that provoke a smile in passing but can be opened to find even more inside them.<br /><br />This, in my opinion, is one of the best of Pratchett's books, the worst of which are some of the most enjoyable stories I've ever read. I highly recommend it.

B007PT1PEY|5.0|Oh, I'd read a few of the famous stories - The Hound of the Baskervilles, the Mystery of the Speckled Band.  But the Complete Sherlock Holmes was my first purchase on my new Kindle, and I devoured it end-to-end over the holiday break.  What a treat.  This edition really enhances the Kindle Paperwhite, with its decorative greyscale chapter and book headings and occasional illustrations.  The real value in the Kindles is catching up with the classics one always meant to read, or revisiting old, old favorites.  The classics are much more cost-effective than new works, and this edition, at least, was clearly someone's labor of love.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Subway surfers is a fun fast paced game. Each level adds more challenge. Similar to temple run. Fun to play. Worth a check out.
B004FGMDOQ|3.0|I felt a little disappointed when I finished this book. It started strong and had an interesting premise but it seems to fizzle out of ideas towards the end and didn't really go anywhere, a bit of a damp sqib. Perhaps there is an exciting second installment on the way - I'll probably give it a try if there is but I won't hold my breath or preorder.
B001V5CIHQ|4.0|A nice retelling of the Disney animation, this one in live action.<br /><br />I think I avoided it in 2003 because I was turned off my Moulon Rouge, and I thought this would be similar, but it wasn't.<br /><br />It seems to have some elements of the Zefrenelli (?) movie of Romeo and Juliet from the '70's, some young love, maybe more similar to Blue Lagoon in the 80's.<br /><br />Fun. Playful and Capt. Hook is menacing and a bit scary, too !
B004VMUS9G|5.0|Ive had it on for about a year and it has not failed me once. I like that it has different tones to get you up and you can set your snooze minutes. This is a great app and I would highly recommend it for the Kindle Fire.
B008OJ291W|4.0|I don't have a problem with Jeff Lynne re-recording these songs, other classic bands have done the same with thier new line-ups (Journey, Foreigner, Kansas, etc). Without even one other member of ELO, I consider this a JL solo album, a companion piece to \\"Long Wave\\" (as I would not consider Paul McCartney as the Beatles, Pete Townsend as the Who, or Jimmy Page as Led Zep). For what it is, it is a very good album of some of thier better radio hits, as long as the buyer knows they are re-recordings, and not originals.<br /><br />As Sony owns the original ELO recordings, and thus would receive the majority of royalties for use elsewhere (movies, commercials, sampling), I believe Jeff did this for monetary reasons and not artistic. That's why he made faithful if not exact copies of the originals that the casual listener would think are ELO. He owns these recordings and would get all the royalties for thier use. If it were for artisic reasons, he would have changed them somewhat (slower, faster, longer. different instrumentation or vocal inflection).<br /><br />That being said, I like this album very much, with one exception, The length. A CD can hold about 80 min of music, but this clocks in at 49 minutes. The japanese version of this has one extra track (\\"Twilight\\" live), and i tunes offers four more others (re-recordings of \\"Ma-Ma-Ma Belle\\" and \\"Rockaria\\", along with two live recordings inlcuding \\"Can't get it Out of my Head\\"). All of these could have easily fit onto one CD. He could have added his 2000 re-recording of \\"Xanadu\\" as well. Had all those been added to this CD, I would have rated it 5 stars.<br /><br />Otherwise, this isn't a bad little collection, if you know exactly what you're getting.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|Not the way that anyone would imagine the ending, but somehow it still makes sense and in a strange way accurately describes the world... Including the good as well as the bad...
0765325950|1.0|Like most others I have been waiting for this book for years and then they push the ebook release 4 months after the actual books release.  Thanks.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This book may have been the best book I have read in a long time. The whole time you are reading you really get to know the characters. This really was a book I couldn't put down.
B000023VR6|5.0|every song on here is awesome, im not gonna write a long-ass review because, i cant be assed...but its well worth getting and paying for so if you're reading this and planning on downloading it, pay for it fools its worth the money.

B00006LSM3|5.0|For any George Harrison fan you will like the cd. It's a must for any music collection. It's too bad we lost a very talented musician 'All those Years' ago.
B003ODIZL6|5.0|The dictionary comes in very very usefull handy i was lucky that it came with my kindle or else i would not have a dictionary for school.
B0071XO8RA|4.0|Stumbled  on this by accident, and lost an entire weekend to this yarn.  Believable characters in a well-imagined world and desperate circumstances draw you along.  Howey offers us a view into a world turned so toxic that stepping out the door is a death sentence.  In such conditions, what does society need to do in order to survive?  Our heroes live in a well-ordered underground bunker where society's conceit of upper and lower classes have become physical reality with administrators living closer to the surface and the folks who keep the machines running live way down underground.  Population is controlled through a lottery for the right to have a baby; and the ultimate crime against society to the desire to go outside.  For those in the Silo who do desire to go outside the punishment is to get their wish--it is a public execution in which the person is suited up in protective garb and sent out the door. They are given the opportunity to do one last deed for society: clean the video cameras that allow the only view of outside that those within can have.  Despite the protective garb, the atmosphere is so caustic that both garb and wearer soon dissolve in a gruesome death.  Despite its seeming placidity, Wool's society harbors dark secrets: what keeps causing top level officials to desire to go outside?  Why do the computers' memories appear to hold only recent history when the Silo seems to have been around for a very long time?  What caused the world to become so toxic?  Are the Silo's occupants alone?  Howey's answers are dished out in a very beguiling package.  Read it!
B003UQQLWW|5.0|Of course my grandson (4 yrs. old), kept watching it every day and at any time.  The story is simple and provide children with possitive values.  Adults will enjoy it too.
B001EBWITA|3.0|Constantine is a somewhat entertaining movie.  Not great, but OK.  The first half of this movie was very good, but the film seemed to run out of steam...  The ending does have one great scene involving the devil, and I would recommend this for movie for &#34;light entertainment&#34; - especially if you are a Keanu Reeves fan.
B00APJLY0Q|4.0|My 8 yr old and 2 year old both love this movie they watch it almst everyday. I cant say I have watched every part and the storyline maynot be as solid as some disney films but for a kid movie it is fun.
B000E1ZBGS|5.0|Loved this movie!  The acting and scenery exceeded my expectations!  It is so unusual for Hollywood to make good wholesome movies;  so was pleasantly surprised when they made this movie.  Such an endearing classic book;  movie was a tribute.  Saw the movie when it came out and always look forward to these classic movies - so far and few between!
B002VWNIAY|5.0|I do not want the 21th Century and all those under the age of 20 now to miss or misunderstand CASABLANCA.  The film exists on two levels... one is a love triangle beteeen Rick, Ilsie, and Victor, her husband.  She and Rick had a brief passionate love affair, with sex, yes, but when she learned Victor was still alive, she deserted Rick and returned to her freedom-fighting husband (anti Nazi).  But when she by accident meets Rick again, he first rejects her out of bitterness at being dumped, but then relents and both admit their continuing love for each other.  Rick has two open visas to escape oncoming Nazi occupation, and seems to plan to leave with her and cause the husband to remain behind, likely executed by the Nazis.  The drama of his hard, anti-marriage stance turns about when he puts she and her husband on the plane to fly to freedom and America.  He remains behind to, likely, take up active opposition to the Nazis while she and her husband fight from American shores.<br /><br />Although not shown directly, it is important to conclude that she and Rich did have one more passionate encounter when she came to ask for the visas.  The two clearly acknowledge their deep love then, and the implication for an adult audience is that they had one last sexual encounter, motivated by their remembered, rediscovered love.  However, Rick tells Victor that Victor is getting the visas because she went to bed with him.  Rick tells this lie to help Victor cope with her loving Rick still.  Victor takes this news stocially or perhaps knew of the lie.  Rick, in part, also tells her that she would later resent his stealing her for himself and her giving up ideals for her \\"selfish\\" love of Rick (troubles of three little people speech).  Her devotion to wifely duty and the higher calling of anti-Nazi-ism gets her on the plane, but the two are clearly giving up their one really loving and carnally passionate future with each other.<br /><br />Unlike simplistic treatment of love and sexuality in Hollywood films since about 1980, this film displays a complexity of emotions that are refreshingly realistic and adult.<br /><br />On the other level, this film portrays a basically heroic but bitter and selfish American (Rick) who, until he realizes that France and freedom are being crushed by Nazis, is -- like America of later 1930s-- coming finally to understand his/America's necessary entry into WW2.  As a powerful political film, Ilsie symbolizes innocent and fraigle France, and Rick clearly stands for all of America in the very early 1940s which is, at first, opposed to taking anyone's side but changes when fully aware of the evil of the Nazis.  Rick does kill a Nazi.  Thus, Rick's evolution and return to his previous freedom-fighting ways (America in WW1) is a clear call and justification of America's enry into WW2.<br /><br />Hollywood plots which have some overt political content, such as this one and, for example, COMING HOME or even ENEMY OF THE STATE, frequently posit the romantic love between a man and a woman to stand for the development of a political position.  In true Hollywood form, the man and woman are at first separated and stand for two political poles, but the politics are resolved by the loving union of the man and woman (gets/girl, loses/girl, gets/girl, or politics seem decent/politics are dirty/politics can be ok).  Frequently, this format sees the conversion toward \\"politics can be ok\\" when the girl yields sexually to the man.  It is an interesting and telling American format that makes palitable, via romance, a political position.exuality in Hollywood films since about 1980, this film displays a complexity of emotions that are refreshingly realistic and adult.<br /><br />On the other level, this film portrays a basically heroic but bitter and selfish American (Rick) who, until he realizes that France and freedom are being crushed by Nazis, is -- like America of later 1930s-- coming finally to understand his/America's necessary entry into WW2.

B004HW7JHE|1.0|This product was shipped twice because the first on was defective. Guess what..... the replacement was defective as well !
B009G7ZYUO|5.0|This was well worth the price and brought a lot of memories back.  There hasn't been too much Rage content for a long time, and admittedly, this all is a rehash of stuff that was available in the past.  However, the concerts and original demo CD they put together are a nice touch along with all the record-style items in the package.
B0083Z614S|5.0|It was a good book and energetic and secretive. I love it I want to see the movie of it
B009UX2YAC|5.0|hey if you have played temple run and think its a little small heres your choice its the best the graphics are great and it is nice and big unlike temple run SO GET IT NOW!!!!
0385360185|5.0|I had heard about this book on the news and from friends that had not read the book.  I don't usually read but listen as I have a 45 minute commute to work.  There are parts that are very detailed and to hear some of the words out loud was shocking.  I learned a lot of new things and really loved the emails/texts back and forth.
B003VANOFY|5.0|Honestly their isn't much to say about this headset because it is quite simply good. The surround sound is good, the mic is good, the general audio quality is good, the battery life is good, the size is good, and its comfy. The range on the headset is very nice to I would say through few walls it still goes like.. 40ish feet. I honestly have zero problems with this headset if your looking for one then look no further.
0345803493|5.0|I could not put it down once I started.  It is very detailed so I also learned a lot while reading.
0385344333|2.0|Okay, this is the first time I have ever taken the time to review anything on Amazon. I have loved every one of Lee Child's Jack Reacher books. I have every one of them in hardcover editions, and until A Wanted Man, have barely been able to close the cover until I have finished. I anxiously awaited the endless advertizing of Jack Reacher being sold for movie rights, looking forward to seeing who would play Jack Reacher. When I saw a poster at a local theatre showing that Tom Cruise would play Reacher, I was extremly dissappointed. A Wanted Man is an equally dissappointing book. It has sat on my nightstand for weeks now. I will finish it eventually, but it just has never drawn me in like all the previous Reacher novels. Maybe Mr. Child has sold out for money. Shame on him for allowing Tom Cruise to portray Jack. This role would have been better served by several big name \\"physically bigger\\" actors. Or better yet...by some totally new, younger, unknown big guy that could have portrayed Jack Reacher in many subsequent movies.<br /><br />Thank you very much, Mr. Child, for many outstanding, exciting Jack Reacher novels. I have enjoyed the ride.<br /><br />But shame on you, Mr. Child, for allowing the small, aging, Tom Cruise to play such a larger than life character as Jack Reacher. And shame on you for peddling such a pitiful Jack Reacher book as A Wanted Man. It is doubtful that I will buy another Jack Reacher novel. I think Jack Reacher should come to life and kick Mr. Child's butt.
B0094M0P4G|5.0|I love this movie! Buying it in HD is worth it!<br />I 've watched it about three times already and still not sick of it! loved it!!!
B007HACDLK|5.0|Vince Flynn puts you in the action, the characters come to life and you could almost fill the pain Rapp inflects on the bad guys.
B0037MSGH2|5.0|This series is addictive with a great story line. The first two episodes are a little slow but once you get pass those you won't be able to stop watching!
0385340559|5.0|Absolutely bhrilliant one of his best.  I always read everything he has written but this one I thought was exceptional.
B009ZQ8FQG|3.0|It was good, I must have expected more. I will keep watching future episodes to see how it shakes out.
B004RGHWIQ|5.0|This movie is spectacular in 2D, but the 3D makes it unsurpassed by its peers.<br />[I'm reviewing the 3D blu-ray version made for 3D tvs, not the kind that requires the blue and red glasses, mind you.]<br />The 3D in this film isn't garish or gimicky - it is often subdued and is skillfully employed to enhance the story when appropriate. The use of 3D in Coraline is comparable to the use of technicolor in the Wizard of Oz; it is most pronounced when Coraline in the magical &#34;other world,&#34; emphasizing the contrast between it and Coraline's normal life as well as its dazzling allure. This makes for some of the most stunning and well used 3D I've seen.<br />The story of Coraline is eerie and enchanting - both children and adults alike can appreciate its dark fairy-tale like qualities.<br />I highly recommend Coraline 3D, it is a must have for any 3D blu-ray collection.
B0063GORYU|5.0|Good version of Spider.  Pauses game when you exit.  Easy to use settings.<br />If you enjoy solitaire games, you will enjoy this version.

B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is an amazing game! Everyone should definitely give this addicting game a try. The best part is connecting to facebook and competing with your friends. If you beat their high score you can brag to them. If you are worried about every score being posted, they won't. It is only your top score that is shown to any other person.
B000002C4J|5.0|This is a great album from Celine Dion.  Of course the smash hit &#34;My Heart Will Go On&#34; from the movie TITANIC is featured on here which most will know.  But my favorite song on here is &#34;To Love You More&#34; - it has powerful vocals and great arrangement.  Plus the violin is a great touch!  Overall a great album and I recommend for anyone who is a fan of Celine Dion.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|So far it is fun and not to hard.  I am not too far along yet  but I am hoping it is as fun as the last one I played which was the Maple Creek mystery.

B004T4KQJS|5.0|Lawrence Krause presents a scientific argument for \\"Creation.\\" Something from nothing is a natural process because \\"Nothing\\" is an unstable able low entropy state. In a universe and multivariate created and ultimately terminated by natural processes, God is constrained by \\"Nature\\" and is therefore irrelevant.<br />Theology must recognize what science has taught us about our universe and multiverse<br /> and rediscover how God fits into this picture. As far as creation is concerned, God is irrelevant, or at th best redundant. Religion must come into the 21st century. Creation myths satisfy superstitious beliefs that are not part of modern thought.<br />Religion must find a place for God in modern physics, or explain how physics meshes with religious belief.<br />If religion in  it s many denominations and belief systems fails to meet this challenge, it will lose its power and influence.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|The Kindle app has become a very important key in my reading experience. It use to be a few pounds of books in my Backpack, now it's hundreds of books on a device that weighs a few ounces. This makes getting around and reading so much easier.
B003E8GQ76|5.0|This movie provides so many truths that it makes each situation seem believable.  The life of a person who is constantly traveling and the loneliness that accompanies that lifestyle.  The first moment of your ego feeling absolutely deflated in the professional space.  The reality of the economic climate that businesses are dealing with along with it's employees.<br /><br />Just love the reality of this movie.  Well done.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|This game is a blast.  My neighbors son showed me this game a few months ago.  Any dead time at apppointments I'm playing it.
0525953728|5.0|THIS BOOK CERTAINLY INCLUDED INFORMATION THAT WE DID NOT RECEIVE THRU THE NORMAL MEDIAL.  A VERY ENLIGHTENING READ.  I HAVE SINCE SHARED THE BOOK WITH OTHERS WHO FEEL THE SAME.
B007R41E8O|5.0|I haven't started playing the game yet; but, as I read all the reviews discussing the ridiculous download time, my curiosity got the best of me  I couldn't find any reviews that specified which Kindle they were using (obviously if it was posted b4 new HD came out, I knew which 1 they meant).To that end, download time was literally 35 seconds-yes I  timed it. That being said, I have Comcast Broadband with very high mbps download speed so that could be the major factor here. And, the new Kindle has more memory than the original; so, if u r contemplating getting this game, I hope this helps. Also, I have the 16 GB Kindle, 7\\" HD, which is the smallest.<br /><br />If I do run into any problems while in-game, I'll def re-post.<br /><br />ADDENDUM:  After initial download, I see what the other people where talking about.  There is a 350 MB download that occurs after the initial download; but, again, no where near what the other ppl went through...download time for that was 8 minutes in total and game opened with no problem.  I do find the HO scenes extremely easy and I've DEF played more fun games of this variety, i.e. Enigmatics, Ghosts of Maple Creek, Dark Arcana:  The Carnival and Stray Souls - those 3 are my top picks right now!  :)

B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|The first half of this book is so light and consuming and then it gets very heavy in content and drama. A well written story with great characters. The ending left me wanting more but that could be the point. I will read more from Colleen Hoover.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Honestly the most heart warming story ever. The relationship they share is beyond beautiful and makes me wish I could have a love like Dean and Sky.

0765325950|3.0|I just finished A Memory of Light, and I don't know how exactly to feel. On one hand, it wasn't bad; in fact, parts of it were downright great (the very brief Olver scenes were absolutely riveting, for example, as were some with Rand in the depths of Shayol Ghul). However...<br /><br />1. Shara- I had been intensely curious to see if the Sharans would make an appearance in this last book, and/or if Demandred would be leading them into battle. Unfortunately, their entrance was underwhelming to the core: they appear in a Waygate, get about two lines of description that doesn't distinguish these completely alien, foreign forces that haven't appeared in 12 books from any of the forces we're familiar with (they carry thin axes versus wide ones, ooh), and hardly any of the good guys seem fazed by their appearance, as though they weren't completely alien, foreign forces that haven't appeared in 12 books. Heck, we don't even get a description of the color of their flags or the symbols that appear on said flags. Frankly, if they weren't identified as Sharans, I wouldn't have thought they were anything new. It was just a bit lackluster. Demandred himself eventually comes into his own as the book progresses, but even his entrance is pretty pathetic, and he doesn't seem to have realized that Rand is at fighting the Dark One at the very moment he's yelling for him to show himself; I guess the telephone lines must be down between Shayol Ghul and Caemlyn. Also, the fact that the Sharans don't show up until about 300 pages into an 800 page book again, makes it hard to see them as anything more than \\"Oh, more bad guys for them to fight.\\"<br /><br />2. Three books instead of one- Three books was wholly unnecessary, in the same way that three Hobbit movies is just ridiculous (however, two wouldn't be out of the question). My biggest problem with this book, as well as with Towers of Midnight, was that some of the most interesting scenes were barely ten pages long, while \\"endless slaughter of bad guys and good guys\\" dominated the text. In Towers of Midnight, we got a measly chapter or two describing Mat's long awaited rescue of Moraine from the Tower of Genjhei; here, we get to read about Moridin and Rand's swordfight for maybe a page and a half. The Sharans show up with little fanfare and then fight the same as any other army; if they'd have made their first appearance a book before, say, spilling over the walls that separate them from the west, raving to support the Trollocs at Tarwin's Gap, I might've found them a little more of a threat and an interesting one at that.<br /><br />3. Descriptions/Brandon Sanderson- Sanderson's descriptions pale in comparison to Robert Jordan; you just can't compare the two. The Blight came alive in Jordan's hand, but it's appearance here is, frankly, kinda lame, and for all the rumored horrors of the high passes through the mountains, we get big harry bear-looking things, and that's about it. Same goes for the Sharans, as I'd mentioned. Same goes for the valley of Shayol Ghul, and the world of dreams (particularly) and a lot of other environments/realms which I highly anticipated seeing again, but then found mildly disappointing.<br /><br />Conclusion: it's worth reading, but it might leave you a little disappointed.

B00A6SZS2Q|5.0|Before Wretched and Divine was released, I had doubts that it would top the previous two albums (especially We Stitch These Wounds; my favorite at the time). I heard that they were trying out some new things, and I was afraid that BVB was going to change itself into something different from the band that I first fell in love with, and I heard someone they weren't going to scram like they had before (which disappointed me, I love the screams). I was wrong in every single way. Wretched and Divine exceeded all of my expectations, and it is no question that it AT LEAST topped Set The World On Fire, and most people would say that it topped We Stitch These Wounds but personally I've grown rather attached to that one, so I don't know, but this is still amazing! Highly recommended.
0143123173|4.0|I have had Craig Johnson's Walt Longmire books on my \\"To Read\\" list for several years. When the Longmire TV series debuted on A&E in June, 2012, I became captivated by the show. However, I finally read Craig Johnson's first Walt Longmire novel, The Cold Dish, which was published in 2004; and I found the book to be a much more engaging, complex and richer experience than the TV shows. In the book, Walt Longmire, a recent widower, is the sheriff of Absaroka County, WY, where he grew up. His daughter is an attorney in Philadelphia whom he tries to keep in touch with via telephone. Absaroka County includes an American Indian reservation and Walt's long-time best friend, Henry Sanding Bear, helps keep Walt from succumbing to depression, and also helps him better understand and navigate the native culture while working cases involving American Indian perpetrators and victims. Walt's favorite deputy, Vic (Victoria) previously worked as a police officer in Philadelphia and he worries that she will not stay in Absaroka County very long, although he believes she would make a great replacement for him in the future. Vic and Longmire get along very well, perhaps because Vic is not intimidated by anyone, doesn't tolerate bad behavior from anyone, and does her job very well. In addition, Longmire's predecessor, Lucian, is a very colorful, irascible man with one leg who helps out when Walt needs him. The Cold Case involves the murder of a boy who had previously been convicted of the violent rape of a young girl. He and the other perpetrators had received a \\"slap in the face\\" sentence for the brutal rape. However, now it seems that someone is dispensing their own justice on these boys. Walt needs help from Henry to find the killer before they kill more of the young rapists. The investigation leads Walt and Henry into the cold wilderness of Absaroka County where their lives are in danger from the suspects and from the weather. This story has many twists and turns of plot, which keeps the reader guessing about the outcome. It includes much brutal action that maintains suspense in addition to curiosity for the reader. It also enmeshes the reader in an American Indian culture that is foreign to most of us and adds an element of mysticism. In addition, the wonderfully diverse ensemble of interesting, quirky, and satisfying, characters in this book add to the reader's enjoyment. Based upon this book, if you like the TV version of Longmire, I believe you will like Craig Johnson's Longmire books even better. If you haven't sampled the TV show or the books, but you enjoy well-written crime/police-procedural stories set in exotic locations with interesting characters and surprising plot twists, I strongly recommend that you read this book.
0345803485|1.0|I got pretty bored during the email bits. Like who wants to read a ton of boring emails? Don't people do that at work all day anyway? The writing didn't seem to be very sophisticated either. I felt like the author learned some big word that day and used it over and over in the chapter she was writing and continued to do so in all the other chapters. I didn't finish the trilogy. I just asked my friend across the street to tell me what happens. Glad I didn't go through all that. :P
B00AAX68HG|5.0|this is an AWESOME game. one of the best games I HAVE.even though it puts up adds I still like it. I alreay finished the game and this is the 3rd day I PLAYED IT.

B003P2WO5E|5.0|I'm a Wheel of Time fan. So I was hesitant to read Sanderson's own original works. I typically like incorruptible protagonists, magic, and drama. Think Garion in the Belgariad, Ender, or The Fionavar Tapestry.<br />All series that stand up to re-reading and leave a mark on you.<br />The Way of Kings was so generous. It's massive. So many characters and details YET I was able to know and hold onto each one by the end of the book. I usually also prefer that the questions I'm forced to ask be answered as we go along. I give him 5 stars for answering the right ones in this book!<br />It's so well written and so easy to visualize that you will enjoy every chapter.

B0049J0CTM|1.0|Got this for my 3 year old gandson to watch. he was upset cause the movie kept freezing up on my I-Pad. Didn't get to finish seeing it. Don't think I'll rent movies anymore.....
B005LAIIA8|4.0|I was reluctant to watch or even allow myself to enjoy \\"Frankenweenie,\\" since I was so enamored with the live-action short version that Tim Burton created back in 1984 during his early days at Disney. The stop-motion-animation and the expanded story help this version to stand on its own. Mercifully, there are no songs in this movie; I am typically turned off by the musical sequences that get shoved into many of Burton's movies. They seem to slow down the pace of the picture and are typically on the annoying side. Without giving away too many plot details, young Victor Frankenstein is a very intelligent science-minded child whose best (and only) friend is his dog, Sparky. When Sparky is hit by a car, Victor uses every appliance in his mother's kitchen to bring Sparky back to life. Complications arise though as other children in his school attempt to revive their beloved (but also dead) pets. Sound creepy? Yes, but done very well.<br /><br />The relationship of Victor and Sparky is at the core of the movie, and with the longer running time, it is able to be fleshed out much more effectively than the short could allow. WIth the medium of stop-motion-animation, Sparky's character is also much more endearing. The short film was a dark satire, whereas this version seems to have so much more heart to it. If you are a dog lover, prepare to shed a few tears during this movie. Besides these two, my favorite character was Weird Girl, voiced by Catherine O'Hara. Get ready when she explains the dreams of her cat, Mr. Whiskers (another great character!). Only Tim Burton could think of wacky stuff like that!<br /><br />The picture is gorgeous; you will definitely want blu-ray to be able to see all of the details in the sets. It will blow your socks off at the amount of props (over 4,000!) that had to be created by hand for the miniature city of New Holland that Victor resides in. Sound is very dynamic, especially during the storm sequences and the climax of the film.<br /><br />Specs for the Blu-ray are:<br /><br />1080p High Definition Widescreen (1.85:1) * English 7.1 DTS-HDMA, English DVS 2.0 Dolby Digital, French 7.1 DTS-HDHR, Spanish 5.1 Dolby Digital<br /><br />Extras on the Blu-ray include:<br /><br />* \\"Captain Sparky vs The Flying Saucers\\"--an expanded version of the short that Victor creates with Sparky, which is only briefly referenced/seen in the movie.<br />* \\"Miniatures In Motion: Bringing `Frankenweenie' To Life\\"--Shot in London, this featurette interviews most of the creative people responsible for the art direction and creation of the sets/props for the movie.

Mollify and dispense with accidental patrons as swiftly and efficiently as possible.<br /><br />3.

Armed with its passphrase and talisman--two hands joined like an open book--they combine Kat's Google access and resources, Mat's modeling skills, and Oliver's way around antiquity with Clay's coding skills to unlock the identity of the Master.

When I saw it, I thought, &#34;Oh boy, that giltter is going to fall off in a day and the paint will wear off and then the horn will break off as my daughter plays with it.&#34;  NONE of that happened - the glitter stays on, the body is some type of plastic/rubber (?) not breakable - it has held up really well despite daily play and &#34;love.&#34;  Our 4 year loves it too - which is the best test.  It goes with a mother unicorn too - and we bought both - so our daughter likes her unicorn &#34;family.&#34;

B009IEXKXI|5.0|Martian exploration and colonisation is one of my favourite themes, and being a hard-scifi sort of guy I really appreciated the detail and logic behind the premise and plot of this book.  I don't know much about the author, but he's either in the business or knows someone that is pretty well.<br /><br />It's a mix of (mostly) first-person diary style with a bit of third person here and there for some necessary exposition.  Mars itself becomes a character in the book.  A really nasty, homicidal character.  The style is great, and the way the diary sections come across really conveys the &#34;what have I got to lose&#34; situation the main character is in.  I was really rooting for him all the way.

0553386794|3.0|After many recommendations I started reading this series.  I enjoyed the story, the writing, the character development and the plot twists well enough and will start reading through the others as I can.  Not being a fan of the books or the TV series beforehand I can see why so many people are hooked on this.<br /><br />Martin has a way of being able to write a science fiction book that readers who aren't \\"sci-fi\\" people can read and enjoy.  While the dragons, direwolves, etc. are part of the story they don't weigh it down or become too much for someone who is not as into the fantasy aspect of the book.<br /><br />He also does a good job of developing the major characters in the book and throwing in some surprises along the way.<br /><br />The mass of minor characters, Lords, and castles is very overwhelming though and he could do a much better job of organizing this in a way to make it less likely to bog yourself down trying to find out or remember what someone or someplace relates to and less obstructive in the flow of the book.  This is a major detractor in reading this series and is too bad because everything else is really outstanding.
B00ARF92HK|5.0|Dredd is a futuristic SciFi action film that takes place in Mega-City One, a large metropolis with 800 million residents and 17,000 crimes reported daily. Judges keep order and work as judge, jury, and executioner. Judge Dredd is evaluating a powerful psychic and potential new Judge, Cassandra; they end up in Peach Trees, a 200-story apartment-like building, where they face off against the powerful drug lord, Ma-Ma. (the story is a bit deeper than that, but I'll keep it short.) Dredd is an action-packed, ultra-violent SciFi blast that oozes style.<br /><br />Dredd's story is fairly simple, but great, nonetheless. After a routine stop, Dredd and Cassandra become trapped in the building and must fight to survive, and move up the gigantic building to stop the sinister drug lord, Ma-Ma. The film introduces a drug called \\"Slow-Mo\\", which makes the user perceive time at 1% of normal. This effect is used to create spectacular action sequences and stunning visuals; this effect is also used often and is never abandoned, so it never feels like a concept or test. Another plus is the variety the film has, from the \\"slow-mo\\" scenes to the tense showdowns, it really packs in a lot for 1hr and 30min. The film stays consistent throughout, without a dull moment; this is complimented by its ferocious pace. The film is very bloody, very gory, and very detailed, especially during the \\"Slow-Mo\\" scenes; this is a pure action film, without restrictions or limits, and I like that. The acting was great in this film. The music matched the atmosphere of the film. The cinematography and visuals were amazing.<br /><br />Overall, Dredd is a superb SciFi action film, with nonstop-action, spectacular effects and visuals, and amazing execution; definitely entertaining, and one of the best time-killers you can watch, thanks to its short runtime and consistent pace. I highly recommend a purchase for action and SciFi fans.<br /><br />Dredd has extreme violence and blood, some sex and nudity.

0765325950|5.0|The fourteenth and final book of the Wheel of Time has everything that you can ask for: battles, magic, despair, happiness, and humor.  \\"A Memory of Light\\" clears things up that were questionable in the previous books, it gives you deeper insight into many of the characters, and it delivers the end of an age.  An age that began only twenty-one years ago in the mind of an author named Robert Jordan.  This book, and series, is the greatest written work of fantasy that I have yet to read.  Finishing this series and closing the cover on this book brought tears to my eyes.  I highly recommend this book to everyone, just read the series from the beginning.  The Wheel of Time brought tears to my eyes, booming bouts of laughter, and made me feel sadness and joy for people I never knew yet still love dearly.<br /><br />If you love, or even mildly like, fantasy and other worlds involving magic, humor, sadness, and insurmountable odds then you will love the Wheel of Time.<br /><br />For those who have debated reading these books, but are scared by it size or reviews from naysayers make a gamble on it. You won't regret it,<br />\\"Dovie'andi se tovya sagain!\\"
0060936223|5.0|I have to admit i don't read as many novels or books as I should but for some reason this book absolutely consumed me. Just flipping through a few pages at the store convinced me I had to finish it. As an artist I knew of Robert Mapplethorpe's work and a fraction of Patti's material too; but vague on their relationship with each other.<br /><br />The way Patti tells her own life story and introducing Robert flows effortlessly, not becoming a chore to read. All the details are there but she talks with the same energy as if listening to her across a table in conversation. Every few pages there's a personal photograph of them in between the chapters so it's small encouragement to keep reading. The photos tug at your interest to want more. Even if you know small details about Robert and Patti, you'll get know them more and the interesting people they met along the way in 1960's, 70's NYC. No boring material that's for sure.

B004LROUNG|5.0|Love John Grisham books, will probably be buying his latest very soon.  Really love having the book on my kindle... so much more convienent.
1559210400|5.0|buck is always wonderful. have been reading her for more than 50 years and each time new insights.she knows the people and the era.
B0015AARJI|5.0|Cheaper than buying it in a store, which makes it worth it. The only thing that is kinda lame is that it the dualshock controllers are not nearly as light as the original sixaxis controllers. But still, a solid purchase.
B001CDLAT4|4.0|Loved it! Very inspirational, we need to watch movies like this more often to connect with nature and the things that matter in life.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Interesting story and study of a past culture/life. Couldn't stop watching it. Characterization is so well done. Excellent sentimental story.
B0083Z6AH6|5.0|Other than to die hard Austen fans, this &#34;other&#34; perfect writing may be somewhat unknown.  It should not be.  If a person believes himself or herself to be a well-rounded reader, but does not insist upon reading every major work of Austen's, they deceive themselves.<br /><br />I thought I had an adequate idea of Austen's works by watching the films &#34;Sense and Sensibility&#34; and &#34;Pride and Prejudice&#34;.  I decided to read these two books, simply out of curiosity as to how they would stand against the films.  I found the movies to be lacking the absolute finest portions of each story, so I decided to read Austen's other works that I had not been familiar with.<br /><br />Persuasion, as well as everything I have read from the pen of Jane Austen, does not disappoint.  Well, except that it does, eventually, end.  It's worthy of as many accolades as her more famous works, and as the others do, causes a sense of general happiness in its reader.
B008JGSM6G|3.0|It's too easy - a bit monotonous.  It should get more and more difficult which ad says it should, but I find each successive level is just as easy.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This was a nice follow-up to the 1st book in the series. I found bits of it to be a little predictable, but on the whole, it was a well-written book and still packed a nice punch.
B004SJ3AXI|4.0|I find myself totally absorbed - though occasionally I get a real stubborn one that seems impossible to complete, and that's when I start stressing and have to put it away.  But I &#34;get&#34; most of them.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|I thought the writing in this book was poor and the scenarios were hardly believable. Would not recommend to anyone who enjoys reading, unless you're looking for some type of cheap romance thrill.
B005HSL626|3.0|This is for really young kids - it is 'way too easy and somewhat boring.  Good thing it was free!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|A well-written book with suspense and not easily predictable. Love the look into &#34;our&#34; future and the possibilities it holds.
B00A757EFW|3.0|I just can't win on this one, the ghosts turn back too soon.  Using finger or the &#34;toggle&#34; are both cumbersome, not like the old old game used to be.
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|A weak ending for the 3-book series. Parts of the book really had you hungry for more; but others were predictable and less than thrilling.
B004UJAOLM|4.0|A dark and visceral piece, shocking, frightening, at the hands of a great story teller. The love story between Heathcliffe and Cathy is only part of Heathcliffe's tragedy. I was not prepared for the second half of the book, which is where the devilment of the hero is displayed. There is nothing in current literature with which to compare it. A compelling read, but hold on to your hats.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|There are a lot of games to play. It will take a long time to beat this one! Some are easy, some are hard, overall it is fun.

B006LSZECO|4.0|I thought this was a very good book, but not a great book, I would read more by this author.
B000YHG72E|5.0|My favorite holiday movies. So many great lines. I look forward to watching it every year and I am not the hugest Will Ferrel fan.
B005OCFGTO|1.0|Do not buy this edition! Everyone who said it does not play or plays like crap is correct! WB should be ashamed!
B00004RJ71|4.0|I thought this was really a good movie,a bit on the long side though.It seemed like I was watching it for about two days.Some of the actors were kind of strange though.They would be in character for a while and in the middle of the scene their accents would change and I thought I was watching a voiced over foreign film.Great movie though. I still dont know which came first,American me or Blood in blood out.Very similar in story line and two of my favorite movies you cant go wrong.
0439023483|5.0|Great series, as everyone knows.  We got them all and have passed them around to all of our friends.  If you haven't already read them, what's wrong with you?  Where have you been?  Good for teens, young adults and grown ups.
1400049628|5.0|Bought this as a gift for my dad who is a zombie fanatic. Won't get into details- but he loves zombies- and loves this book.

1609611543|5.0|I ordered this book for my Daughter, to add to her collection of &#34;healthy Living&#34; section of her books.  Thanks and I will order from you again.
0399160450|2.0|As a longtime reader and fan of the Clancy novels I was disappointed in this book.  I thought the plot dragged throughout the book, even the \\"action\\" scenes failed to grab my attention.  I found the plot implausible and the actions of the characters ridiculous.  I mean really, three Americans moving in and out of the PRC whenever they wanted?<br /><br />I have always been first in line to purchase a new book by Tom Clancey but on his next one I think I'll wait til it gets to the library and do something else with the $20.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|For all you get, it's amazing it's free - obviously, creators want the Word out there!  I don't use most of the bells and whistles it comes with - I use it to read anywhere I am, including church.  You can even download versions so that you can use them offline, which is great when you can't get any wifi signal.  I also downloaded the NCV version, which is (I think) 3rd grade reading level - maybe 6th? The NLT is also an extremely easy version to understand, so if I am talking about a scripture to someone, I don't need to be using my KJV or NASB.  I cannot say enough great things about it.  I have it on my tablet and now on my new phone.  First app I downloaded.  It is awesome. Never had any problems with it - so easy to use. I can even make the font big enough to read without my reading glasses.  Why pay for anything else when this has everything!  This way you can stay in the Word wherever you may be. May He open up your understanding as you read!!!
0156012197|3.0|I had downloaded the original French edition (kindle version) and I had given it a 5 star rating.  I bought the book so that I could read the story to my granddaughter but I gave it a much a lower rating, primarily because of the poor printing quality of the book.
B00AE2J5HI|5.0|Great movie. Go rent it and you will be pleasantly surprised. Has an actual story to go with the action.
B009R8DJ72|5.0|I think its the funniest book, get the book get it is the best.  its for older kids and younger kids. :)  :)  :)
B0017SWPXY|5.0|A dog's thoughts are interesting. I wish I could hear what mine are thinking. I know it would be great.
B005S9EJ14|5.0|the acting, the uplifting story, it's message that it's never too late touched deeply. I have watched with friends and family at least four times since buying.
B009GIPDQS|3.0|whilst the book was an enjoyable read, there was something different about the style from other Grisham legal novels. I couldn't explain it, but I thought the author's notes at the end gave an inkling. I will recommend it to friends, but with caveat not to expect quite the same as his other books of the genre.
B004W2UBYW|4.0|It is simply amazing how much Jobs accomplished during his short lifetime. It boggles the mind about how passionate he was and how he changed our world. Also inspiring is the fact that he was not always successful but never gave up and always came back.
B000SEJHRA|3.0|I love David Sedaris but perhaps in small doses.  His New Yorker pieces are gems.  I liked the book and I'm sure any<br />reader of Sedaris' work will too but there's a difference between liking and loving.
B001NLKT60|5.0|Some authors have the ability to write in a style where you just don't want the book to end. This is how all 3 of these books are written. A good vacation book.
145210655X|5.0|This is a very cute book and I'm glad I came across it! My husband, son and I thought it was funny. We are HUGE Star Wars fans and this is a perfect addition to our collection. We look forward to &#34;Vader's Little Princess&#34; book release! Definitely recommend.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|This book highlights the real life heroes of the OBL raid, but also gives background into the actual life's of the Seals involved. The training, preparation, false starts, and high drama of the raid itself. The book read like a larger than life fiction but it was real. Highly recommend it.
B00ADYYBFI|5.0|The music from this show is amazing. Can't wait until more comes out. I have been listening to this over and over again
B0056BMK6K|3.0|Unlike his novels this didn't really go anywhere. Standard SEO stuff. I had to remember I was reading a business book and not a novel so its probably my fault. That being said it may be very helpful for those who want to self publish. I will say that one of his techniques is the claim to reach out personally to each and every person who follows or registers for notifications, or  sends him an email as requested at the back of each of his books. Perhaps he used to do that, but I have never heard back and must search continually for his new books (which I love) because there are no notifications, so the lack thereof don't lend credibility to this particular effort.
0525953728|5.0|A great book with an inside look at what it takes to be the best. I really like the statement about just making it to the next meal to get him through training.
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|It is a shame this author passed away because I would certainly read anything he would write. Another long read that I wish was even longer.
0062073508|3.0|Classic Agatha Christie -- nearly to the point of being campy, but remaining entirely charming.  I love the way her writing moves through stages that seem to pull in even the most experienced mystery/detective readers, presenting each possible conclusion as perfectly acceptable before revealing the next twist.  In the isolated setting of a snowed in railway, she does a great job of pulling you first to one conclusion and then the next, all of which ultimately pale in comparison to the big reveal-scene.  And of course, her characters -- as always -- are wonderfully illustrated and never fall too-neatly into the generic roles of their genre.  Christie's writing never dates itself as far as technique is concerned, and I don't think her contributions to detective fiction are ever likely to lose their charm.
B003UBTX72|3.0|It was fun to read after about 25% of the way through. Far to much time spent on childhood. I am sure it is important for Keith to detail it but I don't believe he took the reader into consideration. The rest of the book was very good and could have easily gotten 4 stars from me.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|An action packed and thrilling conclusion to the Hunger Games trilogy.  A different feel from the first two books, but still just as exciting.
B0034G4OYK|5.0|Recently we saw [[ASIN:B005LAIIGC Rise of the Guardians (Two-Disc Combo: Blu-ray / DVD / Digital Copy + UltraViolet + 2 Hopping Toy Eggs)]], which was 'ok'. But a few weeks back we saw Hotel Transylvania.<br /><br />Now this movie, Hotel Transylvania, I really liked. We (family) all liked it.<br />This was a lot of fun. Lot of laughs. Cool story with lots of good jokes.<br />Fun and uplifting.

B0095ZMMCK|5.0|A story that can only come from Tom Clancy.  Typical Clancy.  Couldn't put it down until it was finished and then I wanted more.
B00AMBM9MO|1.0|The funny parts in the trailer were spliced together and the best part of the movie.  Don't waste  your money.
B007R0WHMK|2.0|Not what I expected - I don't care for this genre. My fault for not  paying attention to what I was purchasing. I was attracted to the cast, which I usually enjoy but I couldn't get past the subject matter.
B007K87C4M|4.0|I wasn't too sure what to make of this at first. I had only recently discovered Porcupine Tree when this came out, and I'd never heard of Opeth, but the name sounded like a Scandinavian death metal band. I thought the combination might be interesting (even though I wouldn't normally listen to death metal). I wasn't expecting a languid, 95% acoustic album, and that threw me a bit. It doesn't do itself any favours with a rather simple, clichéd, two note first couple of minutes either. I put it on a few more times over the next 3 or 4 months and I gradually warmed to it (although the first couple of minutes still makes me squirm a bit). There are hints of an underlying menace to it, or at least a strong sense of purpose. But it is mostly acoustic guitars with just a few notes of electric guitar sprinkled around, a touch of bass and percussion and some mellotron. It's not immediately obvious, but I think it would appeal to most fans of PT, Steven Wilson, and Opeth, but maybe not straight away.<br /><br />And it is very nicely recorded too! (I have the blu ray audio version)

B005YZX32I|5.0|I haven't made it all the way through this text yet, but I'm using it to keep up with my studies as I am away from home and school for a year or so, and it's got some great content!  The illustrations are phenomenal and the wording is spot-on!  It's not verbose or too intricate, and as I read, subtle hints keep me motivated to read!<br /><br />For those who haven't taken A&P yet, this would be a great resource for learning and keeping up with it whether for any health-care profession or even just as a solid reference guide!
B0015DROBO|5.0|the first of the millennium trilogy. too bad larrson died after the third book because it was reported he planned on continuing the series.
1609611543|4.0|A Dr. friend recommended this book to me.  She lost 25 lbs not eating wheat and she's been maintaining the loss so it inspired me to purchase the digital version for my pad.  Not that it's a bad thing but I found the book initially quite clinical ....but once I got into the heart of what I needed to do, (somewhere around page 200) I found my inspiration rising.  Now I find myself into 3 weeks no wheat ... and experiencing much better sleep and energy.  I am satiated longer without cravings and I am hoping to see the weight results soon.
B00A0HQ7H8|5.0|Lana Del Rey has a cool sound to her voice that reminds me of Marianne Faithful and Mazzy Star combined. This cd has a very sensual vibe to it. There are also songs with a pop edge to them. I love how she combines different layers to her music. I don't think that there is one track on this CD that I don't like. A definite buy!

B002VCR08U|4.0|This book was recommended to me by a friend of longstanding and I enjoyed it very much.  I think most women would have at least fantasised about being in a similar situation at some time in their lives, so the conclusion was interesting.  Well written.<br /><br />Angela
0307719774|5.0|I like this little book.  Fits in my tote and on my desk easily so I don't miss a day of writing.  I love that you can add in the last two digits of the year, if I miss an entry or year it's no biggie.<br /><br />Pros:<br />- Answers can be as simple or elaborate as you like.  If you are going to be long winded, practice writing small or insert additional pages in the back.<br />- Cute size .  Approximately 6.5&#34; long, 4.5&#34; wide, and 1.5&#34; thick.<br />- You can write in the last two digits of the year<br />- Space provided for replies are 4 lines of 3.25&#34; long and almost 0.25&#34; high so your reply can be two or three tiny sentences long.<br />- Has some good questions that can be deep and insightful<br /><br />Cons:<br />- It is small and thick so be prepared to use another book or something to prop your palm higher than desk level.  The first half of the book can be a little tricky with palm placement.<br />- Again, it is a small book so if you want to write a one-page essay for an answer, you have to get creative or write small enough so that only fairies can read it<br /><br />Sample questions:<br />- &#34;What makes 'you' you?&#34;<br />- &#34;What do you want to buy?<br />- &#34;What's the craziest thing you've done for love?&#34;<br />- &#34;Write down something that inspired you today.&#34;<br />- &#34;Today you lost _____.&#34;<br /><br />Overall:<br />- Love it.
B001BWQVUO|5.0|Great video! I teach middle school music at a public school where most of the students are low-income. It was great for them to see a conductor and thousands of music students who come from a similar background, but are amazing classical musicians. The only thing they may find difficult to follow is that the video isn't in English, and it has subtitles. But I've found that if you prepare them, they will be able to handle it.

He has filmed everything since he received his GoPro!  He learned how to edit the videos and set them to music.  He straps this to his head, the spear fishing gun, the dirt bike handle bars and his john boat.  Just waiting to see how long it takes him to strap to the dog!

The effects are great and the story line doesn't leave anything to be desired. I am really excited to see how they play the story line up for the next one and didn't mind catching up with this DVD. Buy it.

B0001GOH6Q|5.0|I bought Big Fish on DVD for my husband because it is one of his favorite films (and mine as well) and his previous copy of the movie got lost in the shuffle of moving to a new home.<br /><br />In my own opinion, of all of Tim Burton's films, this is one of his better ones. It definitely feels like a 'Tim Burton' film in that it contains that fantastically unique level of fantasy that Burton is so well known for. Not only does it tell a wonderful story, it is also so visually appealing. I personally love films where the audience is treated to gorgeous visuals and a delicious display of color.<br /><br />I understand that there are plenty of others who may not share my same thoughts and that is certainly alright. I absolutely love Big Fish and recommend it to anyone who is already a fan of Tim Burton, enjoys films with beautiful visuals or simply loves to watch a good story come to life.<br /><br />If you enjoy films with lots of colors and visuals like Big Fish, I also recommend films such as The Fall, Amelie, Mirrormask,  The Triplets of Belleville, Beasts of the Southern Wild, What Dreams May Come, Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, The Science of Sleep, and others I'm probably forgetting right now!

B009AZZEU2|5.0|This album, although &#34;Ive Been Away for Too Long&#34; was extremely overplayed on the radio, has a great old grunge feel to it. Cornell's voice is a good as ever and the music is as dirty as all grunge fans love. A shining hope of light in a day where music is hard to come by.

B009YP9L7U|4.0|This book was a great read from start to finish.  It is well written and kept my interest completely. I hated that the story had to end.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This book is the best book in the world.<br />I couldn't put it down I loved it just as much as the first
0765325950|4.0|There are no endings in The Wheel of Time, but this is an...no, wait, this is the actual end of the series.  Over 20 years since I began reading it, after 14 books, after well over 4MM words, after the final three books were completed by Brandon Sanderson due to Robert Jordan's untimely death, The Wheel of Time has finally ground to its final conclusion, even if the Wheel and the Pattern grind on (or maybe not! I'm not giving any spoilers).<br /><br />Now that the series is complete and we can look back on it in full, this review must answer two questions: What do I say to the reader who has never read The Wheel of Time, and what do I say to The Wheel of Time reader who at some point abandoned the series?  To the first, I emphatically encourage you to pick up The Eye of the World.  You're in for a very long ride, but Jordan told a story that is, not only the most epic ever told, but perhaps the greatest.  To the second, come back!  Come back for the ending you so richly deserve.<br /><br />The danger with writing an extra-long series is that expectations for and demands from the ending rise with each additional book.  Fumbling the ending can ruin books and books of good work, just as a running back fumbling on the one yard line can ruin a 90 yard drive in football.  Margaret Weis and Tracy Hickman's 7-volume Death Gate Cycle is a good example (I've heard similar complaints about Stephen King's Dark Tower series).  At 14 books, The Wheel of Time has created the biggest demands of all.  But oh how it delivers.  In his famous ESPY speech, former N.C. State basketball coach Jim Valvano encouraged us to do three things every day: laugh, think, and cry.  A Memory of Light will cause you to know each in bushels and droves.  The final climax is both emotionally and philosophically satisfying.  We get long awaited reunions, long awaited confrontations, epic battles (and battles and battles), Crowning Moments of Awesome, and a character or two going down in a Blaze of Glory.  Some beloved characters live and some beloved characters die (and some beloved characters are maimed).  Philosophical questions the series has alluded to from the beginning are brought into sharper focus.  This being The Wheel of Time, we get at least one more romantic pairing and more world-building.<br /><br />A Memory of Light does have a handful of problems.  The characters and the tone remain ever so slightly off, an inevitability for an author finishing such a long-running series, but that's not the primary issue.  Sanderson is much improved in that respect.  Nor do I have any problem with the various choices I'm sure he had to make to fill in the blanks in Jordan's notes.  The essential problem is word allocation and pacing.  Some plotlines and characters drag just a bit while others race by, some plotlines and characters are given pages better served by others.  It's not perfect, but it's a fitting capstone.<br /><br />As Jordan before him, Darrell K. Sweet, who created the artwork for each of the original 13 covers, died before his work was complete.  Although Sweet finished a sketch of a proposed cover for A Memory of Light, Tor decided to start anew with Michael Whelan.  Whelan created one of the best covers of the series (stalactites notwithstanding), and A Memory of Light will join The Eye of the World, The Dragon Reborn, and The Path of Daggers as the only Wheel of Time books on my bookshelf that get to keep their dust jackets.<br /><br />Final Supergirls `It's a Trap!' Counter: A Memory of Light-0 (yay!), total-9.Some beloved characters live and some beloved characters die (and some beloved characters are maimed).

Whelan created one of the best covers of the series (stalactites notwithstanding), and A Memory of Light will join The Eye of the World, The Dragon Reborn, and The Path of Daggers as the only Wheel of Time books on my bookshelf that get to keep their dust jackets.<br /><br />Final Supergirls `It's a Trap!' Counter: A Memory of Light-0 (yay!), total-9.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|I enjoyed it, I giggled a couple of times.  Good naughty fun.  A little too much \\"push me pull you\\" in the relationship but the rest of it was fun enough that I didn't mind.
0756404746|5.0|My friend suggested this book to me and I'm glad he did - it is a phenomenal fantasy book, and is one that I would happily read over and over again. Everyone should give this novel a shot.
B009YQJ322|5.0|Great Movie. Urban is awesome. Nonstop action with a great sidekick and villain who are both women. Highly recommended for action lovers.
1606864599|3.0|Unlike his other book I could not finish this one.  It was a drag and not what I expected from him.
B00A757EFW|3.0|Too hard to play on kindle.  Not like playing a regular game.  Not as easy as some of the other games.
B0064SHI9I|2.0|Can't believe my Android needs this & doesn't back up settings.. doesn't do much.  And more words to meet the 15 word minimum, ok, five more words to go.
B000FCKGPC|2.0|Really liked the first three books, couldn't wait to begin the next one (this one).  What a disappointment!  There were several times I almost quit reading it.  It just drags on with minor characters, side stories that don't really contribute, etc, etc.  I see many other reviews that also agree.  Where the heck were the editors?  This smells of greed.  Instead of editing this down to a tighter, more interesting read, I believe the publisher let George run wild and by his own admission break this into two books (twice the profit!).<br />I'll still give the next one a try since I'm invested, but if it's just as boring I'm done with the series.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I'm enjoy this app all the time, because it's a stimulus for reading the world of God firmly. I like it cause there is many languages and many books for studying the bible. God is so faithful.
B006BDHAX0|4.0|When I first downloaded it, there was a problem with it shutting down suddenly in the middle of a game. But it looks like an upgrade has fixed it. My only complaint is they have symbols instead of words for instructions &amp; it took me a while to figure out which ones saved your scores or erased them. Therd were a couple others I had trouble with too. Now that I have it figured out, I'm enjoying the game. I do have to almost bang on my screen sometimes to select the tile I want. Is that the phone or the game?
B004HW7JMO|5.0|Great story line. Love this show from the characters to the historical details. A great buy for those that like this era.
B004I8WD6E|3.0|I got it before my iPhone came so, used it right away. 3days later the glass broke.  NOT happy.  Bought an Otter
B004SJ3AXI|3.0|It's not bad. My daughter plays with it more than i do. So I suggest getting the game. Thank You
B004GEB9UQ|5.0|Been following this diet since Dec 26 and Ihave lost 13 pounds. It has been super easy! If you want to lose weight, try this diet!
B004GJYROG|5.0|Reminds me of my childhood this is such a great movie to watch and show younger kids that only see the ridiculous things put out now, definitely a classic! Very fast shipping as well.
B00AA0TJO8|4.0|I'd like to see expansions of this app.  I have looked for similar games but have not found one as good.
B0032MV9AI|5.0|500 days of summer is a classic. You will not be disappointed when you watch this movie. I recommend everyone watch this movie.
0765325950|5.0|Those one star reviews are ridiculous! I am not much on sending in reviews, I am here to offset the idiocy of giving a book a one star review without actually having read the book just because it isn't available in e-book, also to show support to the original creator, Robert Jordan, one of the greatrest authors of all time. I have been reading these books since I was in high school, eagerly awaiting each new release and rereading the seriers over and over. I cried when he died. Those people are tarnishing his memory.<br />  That being said, I bought this book upon release. My girlfriend didn't see me for a day and a half as I devoured it. Stunning. Sanderson does Jordan and the Wheel of Time more than justice, he channels Jordan.
B00127RAJY|4.0|A very intense workout. Not for the faint of heart. It is worth it, if you want that extra push. Would recommend to anyone who is serious about losing weight.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Love it I play it all the time . It's so much fun and it's relaxing .when I am bored it fills in the time
B00A0SKFLG|2.0|I liked the idea of redoing this classic flick but found the lack of correlation to the previous story disturbing. They don't even go to Mars in this one which was the whole story along with the secret agent part from the last one. If you are going to remake a movie, add some things to the story, update special effects, but keep the basic story the same. Very disappointed...
B005PK553C|5.0|Seriously addictive.  Can't wait to geek out on the second season. We loved it as much as we love The Walking Dead, Hell on Wheels, and Game of Thrones.
B007ZGBZHE|5.0|Two Graves is a triumph, a roller coaster of a read. Preston & Child have quite a franchise can not wait for the next book (s).
B007KZY1YY|3.0|I found that I started skipping pages and jumping paragraphs just to get the book finished as it was rather boring towrards the end.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|Fast paced...about the time you begin to feel comfortable a new crises arises.  From each crises a new lesson is learned.  I was compelled to read the whole trilogy.<br />Having grown up in Vancouver, Washington and lived most of my life in or near all the places in this book, I felt at home as I read.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I couldn't put it down. Easy read, and well written. Bring on book 3! It's been a while since I've been lost in a book the way this series has captured my imagination.
B0051UP5NQ|3.0|I got this so I could open edit and use a bunch of my MS office files on my kindle.  and it works I can open edit and resave my files the key board on the kindle can be hard to use and some of hte formating is gone, like differant collered text.<br />for 14.99 I expected more.
B005LAJ16I|5.0|Great services by Amazon. Price was right at the time. I see that the prices do fluctuate. I am assuming it is because of demand, but I got it at a good price, so not really complaining.
B008JMKN4Y|4.0|*revised 2/8/13<br /><br />I realized I posted a review of another book here so I am fixing it....<br /><br />I really liked this story.  Travis is really flipping out of control but there is a really sensitive side to him.  he was drawn to Abby's gentleness and wholesomeness...or so he thought.  She wants a different life then what she has led in the past, though no fault of her own.  I loved the platonic aspect of their relationship in the beginning.....it slowly revealed the simmering love they had for each other....then they crossed the line to no return and the pages smoked.  I liked her spunk and how she stood up to him and I loved how he ultimately bends to keep his girl.  Pretty intense reading and very emotional.  I was riding on that wave with them through every swell and curl.  Good read and highly recommended if you are tired of the same-o same-o boy meets girl crap.  You won't get it with this story...
1452110581|4.0|I purchased this book as a jokey Christmas gift for a close friend of mine, who is a cat lover. As soon as she opened it, she was happy. It was a great gift for the price. The only thing is that the book itself is smaller than I expected. Not a problem though. It makes a great bathroom book.
B005LAIHHC|1.0|This is the worst of Sacha's three movies. I was waiting for it to be be funny, like the coming attractions. All the funny shots in the coming attractions were ALL the funny parts apparently.
034580404X|3.0|I'm a little disappointed...All of the rave yet the book did not catch me.  It's taken too long to get to anything worthy...Try Zane
B008G12ERC|5.0|This album is truly a masterpiece! It may be a little mellower than previous albums but the mix of songs and harmonies are incredible. One to enjoy over and over again!
B00181JGI2|5.0|I'm not a big movie buff, and I'm not someone who can watch the same movies over and over, but I NEVER get tired of The Big Lebowski. It makes me laugh every time.
0525952926|5.0|I read this book on my Kindle and then bought this for my dad for Christmas. The book was delivered in good condition.<br />I absolutely love Ken Follett. I think his character building is awesome and this story is no exception.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Easy,  fast,  great!  Use it lots.  Definitely recommend Calculator Plus Free for any one who needs calculations quickly and easily.
B0012GTZC0|4.0|I love all of his books. I think I prefer the trilogies so far, because it gives him more time to build more characters and that is my favorite part of his writing. On the other side, I think it is nice that this story gets wrapper up in one book. It was definitely a page turner at times. Great suspense and build up.
B00AECGQF2|5.0|My 2 year old daughter loves this game and I enjoy playing it to..cute game...fun decorating and dressing different hair and fashion stlye
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|A friend recommended this book because she knows I love historical fiction. I didn't know anything about this or the follow up but I loved them both. I could not put it down!
B004RJMUJO|5.0|It's a great game. I would reccommend to anyone with some freetime on their hands to pass the time.  Yeah.
0451232577|5.0|I love Ken Follett and would recommend every book I have read by him. I think his characters is amazing, I find myself really caring about them and wanting to know what will happen to them. This book is a page turner because of that.
031606792X|5.0|Why cant you just click the number of stars and be done? Most of time I do not want to go into detail.
B003UESJHY|5.0|I seen this movie at the theatre when it was released and right away it became one of my favorites. Im not a huge boxing fan , i really havent watched boxing since Tyson was the Man. Every actor in this does a great job, it has its drama and its comic relief in it.<br /><br />Christian Bale Im not a fan of....but he did an amazing job on his portrayal...you will see at the end of the movie when the credits roll with the real life guys.
B003ODIZL6|4.0|I found it inclusive. Anything I could think of. it had ...for the most part.  I would recommend that everyone should have an online dictionary.<br />  I think phones should come with one version of the dictionary already loaded on them. I mean, even  free phones.. Everyone needs to have access to a good dictionary when sending out texts or mailings.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Couldn't put it down. Loved it. If you are looking for an easy read then this book is a good one for you.
0307895475|4.0|I dun bin thinking it was gunna be a couple hundrerd pages long and be a rip off but was HUGE
141659521X|5.0|Rapp is the consumate American covert ops guy. Takes no crap, does not hesitate to take out the bad guys regardless of the critism.
B0000042MY|5.0|This is my fav movie soundtrack... I find it energizing.  I like to put it on when I have a lot to get done!
0316069434|5.0|Great Harry Bosch thriller. Always solves the crime regardless of the age of that crime.  Good to see Harry developing a relationship with his only daughter.
B00A8ECU24|4.0|It's pretty fun for a free game. And my little girls love my little pony and have fun just watching me play.
B0063IH60K|4.0|graphics are good. game doesn't hang up. great way to pass the time. really tired of the singles popup. guess that is the price you pay for free.
B000FBFN1U|5.0|All of those words in the title - no, I'm being serious. The whole series is freaking AWESOME!!!! Read them! That's all I can say!!
B00A0NOF7G|5.0|What a fun read!  My only complaint is I am unable to find more books in this series. I'm waiting!!
B00936A0RU|5.0|For the price, the quality of the movie, and the ability to sit down and kick up after a long day of doing whatever 'Lawless' is an absolute steal. If you are looking for something to wet your appetite for a thriller that takes a slew of big names and throws them together in an epic that was a masterpiece, this is your movie.<br />-The acting was superb.<br />-The directing was spot on (especially for a relatively unknown director).<br />-The look of the movie was gritting and yet riviting at the same time.<br />-The replay ability is high without question on it.<br /><br />Here's a tiny snipit from my RottenTomatoes review:<br />...‘Lawless’ played out before my eyes like a siren luring her prey to their watery deaths—only in this case it would be under the moonshine...<br /><br />For the whole thing please follow this link: [...]<br /><br />I absolutely suggest buying this movie. There are too many reasons to name and too few to be bothered naming.<br /><br />4.5 Outlawed Stars out of 5!
B008IJTFYW|5.0|very realxing sounds; soothing and peaceful.  The waves remind me of when I used to go to the beach.<br />This app is realxing and it can also bring back memories.
B000000OF6|5.0|I bought this for my husband for Christmas, it's Queen it speaks for it self<br />Very buddy enjoys Queen yes
B003VANOFY|5.0|Love the beautiful 7.1 surround sound on this baby.<br />I can even use the iPad camera connector to use this on my iPad for GREAT sound and skype calls.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|This is a powerful revelation of the other side of human life, and a strong argument against those who say there is no God
B00AHXIC50|5.0|Love, love, love this album! Great quality tracks. Every person needs this in their playlists! Can honestly say it's the same level of his last album.
B001NLL93W|5.0|This is my favorite of the Mortal Instruments series thus far and I can't wait to see what the next one brings.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I wasn't going to buy it cause it cost so much money, but my friends told me about it so I took a risk, and bought it. It was awesome, super.<br /><br />Funky Pony approved.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Exciting, emotional, great reading. Much more real than the Fifty shades thrilogy, with more complex and well constructed characters. Liked it.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|Teenage love with a disturbingly beautiful twist. If you fall in love with the characters and their stories, you'll be able to put the pieces together before Sky does. but However, nothing prepares you for the entire story, the heartbreaking one.
B00846REIS|5.0|Exciting, emotional, great reading. Much more real than the Fifty shades thrilogy, with more complex and well constructed characters. Liked it.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|I honestly like this because it doesn't scare you to death when you wake up. Plus it allows you to wake up before anybody else in the room/house
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Exciting, emotional, great reading. Really exciting story, Christian Grey is one hell of a twisted, but fascinating soul. Loved it.
B0050DZ8J0|4.0|Fantastic app; essential for 21st century proffesionals; to keep up to date with trends. The linkage to social media is perfect.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|This has to be one of the most intense love stories ever. My emotions felt like they were on a monster roller coaster. I went from asking what is wrong with these people to is it healthy to love someone so much. Truly one of the best books I have read in awhile! Can't wait for the next book.
0765325950|5.0|I've been reading this series for over 20 years. At last the end has arrived. I can not recommend The Wheel of Time highly enough.
B00846REIS|5.0|I couldn't put this book down I read it in 2 days which is a first ever for me. It was great and would definitely recommend.
B001BWYZWA|5.0|This is an outstanding movie that I wanted in my collection to share with my family, I was not disappointed!
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I can't wait until the next book comes out. I really enjoyed this book and couldn't put it down. Very good reading!
B0063IH60K|1.0|Do not install. Ads make it impossible to play the game. There is absolutely no good reason for the game developer to do so. Will never install games from mobilityware again.
B0040QDMBE|5.0|This book openned my eyes. Everybody should know how work the world, how many statemens given to belive are false.
B000FC130E|5.0|Well written and full of surprises.  Thoroughly enjoyed a journey through an alternative London.  Full of action, adventure and suspense.
B006G3MZRQ|4.0|The acting in this movie is excellent, especially Nick Nolte, and I definitely teared up during the climatic ending; however, the screenplay is somewhat derivative of Lionheart (1991) with Jean-Claude Van Damme and Gladiator (1992) with Cuba Gooding Jr. & James Marshall.  That aside, great movie!
B00005NTN5|5.0|May be a low budget movie. And of course stereotypical. But such a good movie. Not too shabby for two straight actors. oh yeah. :)
B00A9X9ORI|4.0|Liked the movies good plot Bruce Willis is good enjoyed it recommend it to Bruce fans or action fans good plot
B008QTVNUI|5.0|As a fan of the &#34;24&#34; series, I was curious to see if &#34;Homeland&#34; could fill that void.<br />I was not disappointed--great writing, acting, and full of plot twists; just what I was looking for!
B007704HO6|5.0|I loved this book. This is a wonderful story of how two friends, a cat and a human, find and help each other overcome their problems, one drug addiction and the other ill health. This is not just a heart warming story but has a bigger message about love, friendship, loyalty and caring for others. Bob is a remarkable cat and James is a remarkable guy.
B0086213XW|3.0|I really wanted to like this movie. I love the premise and the actors involved. I love that big names take the time to work with small indies. Something was just missing, or off. It's nice for a lazy Sunday - but I feel like renting it VOD for $5 was a waste of my money. I'm so sad to say that.
B008JGSM6G|1.0|It is a good app if your looking for good recipes. I have used<br />This<br />App<br />Fort<br />Making<br /><br />Good<br />Chinese<br />Food<br />As they say you r way u eat
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|Evernote is really great. This app just helps me seamlessly access my docs/ web notes from my kindle fire now.
B000OZ0NXA|4.0|Fast moving well defined charecters and sub plots. At conclusion Jack moves on leaving the reader wanting more. Quick read.
B005LAII12|2.0|Don't waste your time watching or buying this movie. Um, a teddy bear taking a bubble bath?! and SPOILER: I totally called it on the bear going back to being a stuffed bear when he came apart on the softball field. And the thing at work with the girl- are you kidding me?! This movie was lame!!  Go watch something more worthwhile and inspirational! I hope you all are smarter than me to go invest your time doing something more worthwhile!
B00AMBLDEE|4.0|Jeremy Renner and Edward Norton did a good job as usual. I enjoyed some of the new things added to the story line. It's worth watching if you have seen the previous Bourne movies.
B007MDB548|5.0|This movie is the 3rd or 4th tinkerbell made. It shows a lot of neat scenery with winter and also some summery scenes but mostly wintertime. And again shows the meaning of friendships.  My 4 year old son loves the movie too.  I love all of the Tinkerbell movies.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I loved the first season of Downton Abbey and I could not wait to see season 2.  As a prime member, I am able to stream it to my Kindle which works fine.  I know season 3 has already started but I wanted to watch season 2 first and this gives me the opportunity to watch it at my convenience.  If you like soap operas, you will love this.  The acting is great and I enjoy seeing the relationships among the upper class and the servants.  If you are bored with the same old TV programming, give this a try.  I don't think you will be disappointed.
B004I744AS|5.0|Luv this app, it's free and loaded with info, goes well beyond just a dictionary, I would recommend this to everyone!
B00A0SJWQU|1.0|Wow...this movie was horrible.  If you have seen the original with Arnold, odds are you're going to hate this one with a passion.  For one, they never leave Earth...which totally destroys a major portion of the movie.  I still fail to understand how Colin Farrell gets work....I haven't seen him anything that I thought was remotely good.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|Amazingly thrilling story that will keep you wanting more. A surprise ending that will make your jaw drop. Another fabulous tale by Rick Riordan.
B0053TMP24|5.0|This is probably the best book I have ever read .I think that if anyone likes mythology ad much as I do here's what I recommend all of Rick Rorden's books he is probably the best writer I have ever heard of.
B0015DROBO|5.0|I loved this book!  It really kept me wanting to read more - I hated to put it down.  I loved the way the story kept building, even after one mystery was solved, there was more to discover.  I also loved learning about the characters and what made them tick.
B0018QQQK8|5.0|This a such a great a story. I loved how it unfolded from beginning from start yo finish. Very good.
B003ODIZL6|5.0|I chose this rating because of the book it's very very long but I like it thought I also like the definitions for each word it is very very ··· nice I really want to know what you can you do when the words are very huge I really hmmm i really like this book it's really like this book I read it's just like hunger games the book it's just a few words I don't understand really like it seems the book is very very huge I like it to much
B004I8WD6E|5.0|I got this for the price.  It was reasonable and simple.  The screen protector went on flawlessly (and I sometimes have difficulty getting them on without bubbles).  The cover is simple and plain but I love it.  I dropped my phone several times while in this case and it didn't break in any way.  Love, love, love this case!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|You see, I have great respect and appreciation for my young son-in-law, Jason.  But when he gave me a Kindle copy of Wool for Christmas, saying it was written by an old friend of his, I hardly suspected that I was being given a work that beginning to rise on its own merits as perhaps the first self-published work of science fiction to become a true classic in the field.  But I knew nothing of that until just now, skimming the other reviews here on Amazon - and I find that news kind of disappointing.  I was ablaze to be one of the few and the first to praise this outstanding piece of fiction that came to me by chance, only to discover that I was a bit behind the curve.  Oh, well. But what do you expect for a 63-year old that grew up on classic SF and who has really only returned to the genre in the last 10 years via the portal of alternative histories?<br /><br />Regardless of the fact that I will break no new ground in this review, there was never any doubt in my mind that I would write it. I consider Wool as the best novel of any genre that I have read in recent times, and that needs to be said.  From the beginning I was impressed by the seamless storytelling ability demonstrated by Mr. Howey. His prose flows easily, with seamless transitions, confidence, and pinpoint timing. I am no writer (nor even reviewer) of fiction, but I am a voracious and insatiable consumer of novels. And after a lifetime as a consumer, I know what a good book feels like as I am reading it, I can tell when a story is concluded in a satisfying manner, and I can never mistake that desire to read more of the same.  I found all this and more in the Wool Omnibus. Forgive me my geezer recollections, but reading this book was like a flash-back to classic hard science of the Fifties and Sixties, but with all the technology not so much plausible as existing.  The book's genius, like that of many science fiction classics, is in the way that it creates a plausible society that has its structure, social and otherwise, defined by its physical environment, in this case a largely man-made, post-apocalyptic environment. The book has plenty of the clever twists and turns that sci-fi fans love, and it was gratifying to be surprised by a plot development or two.  I'm delighted to discover that the place has been set for two more Silo feasts with the Shift books.  While Wool was a gift, I've already bought most everything else by Mr. Howey available here in electronic format.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I rented this book two days ago, and just finished. My father-in-law recommended this series to me, and let me borrow the first movie. I was immediately hooked! I have never enjoyed a series so much. So well written, and the story line is just fantastic. If you have a day or two to kill, I highly recommend this book. I will be borrowing the last book ASAP!!!
B0090SVDUO|5.0|Released on Oct 2012, this 2lp set includes 3 new songs (liner notes from the producer say it's composited from separate recordings from the remote truck that captured previously released songs). The album art is nice and the inner jacket has Bruce Botnick (producer) and \\"surviving\\" member (Ray, Robby, and John) notes. Bruce's notes conflict with the sticker on the plastic bag about the \\"new songs\\" - presenting the \\"entire legendary live show available now for the first time.\\"<br /><br />Hello, I Love You; The Wasp; and Spanish Caravan are noted as recovered \\"Lost Tracks\\" on the plastic outer wrap. I labeled them below by side.<br /><br />It's so amazing, I wish it were a three disk set with more time between tracks from the live action. However, the sides of the set list play out well to keep the flow of the show going. I would have liked the sides in the description, but I guess that's skipped since only applies to vinyl.<br /><br />Disc: 1 Side 1<br />1. Show Start/Intro<br />2.

B0098TL4YU|5.0|Amazing singer Amazing Man another great album from the voice The best yet can't wait to see what comes next
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|Loved juniors development a great story with perfect blend of the old and new characters.  Look forward to the next one.
030758836X|1.0|The plot the author came up with was lame, unrealistic, and it dragged on forever. The characters were annoying and poorly developed. I didn't even \\"read\\" the last 50 pages, just skimmed through it to cross it off the list. Glad I didn't waste any more of my time and neither should you. I don't know how the heck this got published.
B0058VW36U|5.0|This is a great game for all ages.  It tests your logic and hand eye coordination.  Sometimes you have to multi-task in order to feed the monster candy.  I watched my great nephew playing at Christmas and was surprised at ow quickly a five year old learned the concept and how much better he was at quick skill movements.  I would recommend this game for everyone, especially for the price.  It is a break from angry birds and bad piggies.
B00AESN8XY|5.0|really great strategy game that has high replay value. I love how casual and easy to play it is while getting you to think
B000UJ48O0|2.0|the cover the cvc's came in was in very bad shape. most of the dvd's had fallen out and were scattered about in the box it was shipped in. the box it was shipped in itself was very battered. the first two disks were very scratched and will not even play very dissatisfied as this was a christmas gift.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|A must read...definitely read the 1st one before .I couldn't put this book down...when I wasn't reading it...I was thinking about it. So excited to read the next one!!
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Not only is this a fun game, but it is not so easy and that makes it very challenging.  Would reccomend.
B006BDHAX0|5.0|That is what I love about it. Really tough to get a good time in. Very complicated good mind developement.
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|Excellent characterization defines this deeply human tale with a suspenseful ending. But the report on so much suffering endured by the innocent children really broke my heart. I found myself wondering how many children are still suffering like this in this world and what I can do to help them.
B0076DELIG|5.0|Bosch is smart and human.  I hated for the book to end.<br />Connelly writing makes you want more. Cut the word<br />requirement or nobody will review.
B008KYOCA2|1.0|I down loaded this but found it not to be what I needed.  Be more frugal when selecting a progam of this type - read the overview all the way through.
B007STBUIW|5.0|The interview extra with the cast members was great. The movie continues to make us jump and turn our heads. Loved it.
B006ZAZ31U|3.0|Fearless. Great story of courage. Too much emphasis on religion for me..The exploits of Navy Seals are well covered by the author.
B000ZLFALI|5.0|I got a great buy on a movie that I love and received it in three days.  I would definitely recommend.
B006LSZECO|1.0|the book definately throws you for some loops, did not expect the way the story went, however the ending was horrible, ruined the book for me. dont waste your money.
B0001GL3K4|5.0|Really quick delivery.  I got a great price.  One of my favorite movies of all time.  It's a holiday staple in our household.
B009O5CLZY|5.0|My brother go this game, so I thought... Well, I will try it out. I LOVE IT!  It is one of the best and most enjoyable games I have ever played.  It is similar to temple run, but I like this game a whole lot more.
B006OGMEUI|5.0|when eluveitie was new, i loved the ven and spirit albums. they were so good and had those songs that really stood out, and it was this awesome, unique blend of folk and metal that flowed well. songs like tegernako and uis elveti are amazing, and because of those albums i became a eluveitie fan, or follower if you will. got all their other albums which i think are great, and then i heard they were coming to the u.s to play their new album in it's entirety!! yes! after several years finally a chance to see one of my favorite metal bands! i got this album and at first listen, i thought it was decent. you know, it's got a few songs that stand out, but overall, it's just fine. then i saw them live (AND GOT TO MEET THEM ALL!!) and they played this full album. that's when i really saw how talented and great this band is. i'm not sure what some of their songs are about, but this album had a little more of a concept vibe, and to me it was more than just average, it was awesome! eluveitie blew my mind again, and i listened to this album a lot more after the show, and every song is amazing off this album. to be honest though, i still like spirit a little more than this album, but if my ipod's on shuffle and a song from helvetios is playing, i won't skip it. eluveitie is awesome and i am looking forward to another album from them and i hope they tour in the u.s. again. they don't fail to blow my mind and get me to headbang like crazy :)
B00AA0TJO8|3.0|This game is fun, but there just is not much to it. This game would be great for younger players... Not older.  Don't get me wrong, it's fun but I wouldn't pay for it. I got it as free app of the day. Don't waste your money, honey.
B008OTTSX4|4.0|this is a pretty good tribute album,<br />i think because of the amount of anticipation there was for this album, i was a little bit disapointed.<br />IF I COULD CHANGE ANYTHING, it would be to TAKE OFF THE FLAMING LIPS COVER<br />i have seen the flaming lips live and not bad i thought but i do think their cover of smoke on the water is a shame to deep purple. i think it's one of the worst songs i've heard in my life.<br />also, i was hoping the chickenfoot cover was gonna be a studio song<br />i saw the live performance of highway star and was looking forward to this on cd<br />and i listened to it and went oh this sounds familiar -_-<br />...now the metallica and iron maiden covers are fantastic. if you like the bands, you will be very impressed, especially the metallica cover of \\"when a blind man cries\\". so much emotion and it gets me excited for an upcoming 2014 new metallica album if they sounded this good on the tribute album.<br /><br />also i love the santana and steve vai's tribute to this album, so much talent<br /><br />overall, i did really enjoy this album, and if you like deep purple or the bands that covered the songs, then you'll probably like it. there are just some things that didn't make this \\"perfect\\" for me i guess.<br />but i'm happy i bought it
0765325950|5.0|I think its ridiculous to bump a book down to one star because you're unhappy about the release date.  I've been reading this series for about 15 years now, and all of the release dates have been frustrating because I hated waiting. But I still read them, and still loved all of them.  I've only started Memory of Light, and am listening to it over Audible since carrying a large hardcover to work is difficult (and too obvious that I'm \\"multitasking\\").  I've only made it to chapter 2 so far, but I am impressed.  While the slower-paced earlier novels never bothered me, it is nice that, so far, this one is so action packed.  I've thoroughly enjoyed it up to this point!  I'm actually happy at this point that I'm listening to it over audible, which I would not have done if the ebook had been released now, because it is making me draw out the length of time it will take to finish the book. I probably would have read the entire thing by now, and be very sad that the series was over!
B000001FTD|5.0|This is the album that really got me to become one of those die-hard anthrax fans. I saw them live last summer and met the band and I liked their popular songs like Madhouse, Antisocial, Indians, etc. I got this album after I met them and started listening to it before their Metal Alliance Tour kicks off this year. I must say that after listening to every song the whole way through, my appreciation for this band increased more than I expected and they are for sure one of my favorites out of the big four.<br />\\"Among The Living\\" 10/10, starts with a sick intro and gets heavy and is a cool concept/idea that the band was going at at the time. One of those songs I love to chant along to.<br />\\"Caught In A Mosh\\" 10/10, you really get what anthrax is about when you hear this song. full of energy and fun, and gets that 80s punk-ish style in perfect balance with thrash. heavy, fun, and so cool live. so metal \m/<br />\\"I Am The Law\\" 12/10, ah yeah bonus points. this song is that one that always gets stuck in my head. it's not as fast as a lot of anthrax songs, but oh man just listen to that, bang your head to that sick bassline, guitar riff, drum beat, and cool, fun lyrics \m/ and awesome vocals!<br />\\"Efilnikufesin (N.F.L.)\\" 12/10, awesome guitar, they got something pretty honest to say, and it's catchy, fun to listen to. at this point in listening to the album, it's like a classic after another after another. anthrax did a great job because they got their sound, and every song has that unique power and beauty off this album<br />\\"Skeleton In The Closet\\" 10/10, great song, yet another classic and has a catchy chorus that is just another great reason why this album is so special.<br />\\"Indians\\" 12/10, ahh yeah classic, if you get a chance to see them live, this is the song to go nuts for during the WAR DANCE. awesome song, unique, and stunning guitar work (try learning this song on guitar if you play, it's fun)<br />\\"One World\\" 10/10, cool another awesome song that has a good chorus and talent.<br />\\"A.D.I./Horror Of It All\\" 10/10, it's that song off the album that didn't stand out to me at first, but when i listened to the album the whole way through, i turned up the volume for. belladonna proves he is one of the greatest metal singers, and just another headbangable classic<br />\\"Imitation of Life\\" 10/10, ah yeah it's that one crazy song at the end of every anthrax album ;), it's all fast and fun and you could tell they love doing what they do best \m/. it's really cool, very fast, has a pretty sick breakdown, and the drums, guitar, vocals will impress you.<br /><br />so overall, AMAZING album, it's what got me on an anthrax cd shopping spree (i'd recommend any belladonna album, fistful of metal [sorta like iron maiden without bruce dickinson for lack of a better analogy, but still a great thrash album], and some stuff from the bush area is really cool)... but just gotta let you know:<br />DO NOT buy this album just to listen to the popular hits, every song off this album is a hit.<br />I could say now I do like \\"N.F.L\\" as much, if not more than \\"Indians\\"<br /><br />Don't hesitate to try and see them live too :) very fun live, and I paid good money for VIP tickets to see them again this year!
B0017SWPXY|5.0|This was such a GREAT read.  I highly recommend it.  The way the author narrated as a dog was fantastic, it made me think of how we always think our dogs would talk.  Read this book!
B0007MWZEK|5.0|I love my new sweeper. I have purchased similar sweepers but they were not the same quality.  The others did not hold up as well. I'm very pleased.
B008HK3XKO|4.0|This is a good case for the money.  I like how the Kindle shuts down when you close the lid.  You do have to open the cover to charge it, but it's not a big deal like some reviews have stated.  I like the strap that keeps it closed.  My 5 year old son likes to use it, so this case is a must.
B000VPUIA6|5.0|Years later the Beatles still rock!<br />A must have for any Beatle fan. Their second film catching the fun and silly side of the fab four.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|I liked this very much. At first I really thought &#34;oh no&#34; I'll never get this, but it was<br />a great challenge for me.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Catching Fire is a great sequel to The Hunger Games.  This second edition carries on the story with great storytelling and subperb  twists and turns. The ending is fascinating and already starting to read the third book.
1608871045|3.0|this book seems angled more towards a younger audience and uses alot of in movie shots instead of behind the scenes making of pictures. pretty disapponting because i thought there would be more diagrams and prototype pics but its more of a book your kid would read a few times then put on a shelf.
B006AX6ONI|5.0|I haven't finished the e-book in its entirety, but I absolutely love everything that I have read so far. I would definitely recommend this to all entrepreneurs.
1419703692|5.0|this book is packed with interviews, information, and very detailed descriptionsof the making of the movies. it's a seriously great book because it focuses alot of nolans directing style and stories from filming. if you're a nolan or batman fan this is pretty much a must read
B003O86FMW|5.0|Highly recommend to all who are willing to keep an open mind and have a twist thrown in here or there
B00AQ3K8IU|3.0|This is basically a teen romance novel. Didn't realize that when I bought it. For what it is, I think it is well written & has a fairly good plot.
B005HSL626|5.0|Great game for the whole fmily. It will be hard for you to put it down. My family go's back and fourth to beat eachothers scores. Even my 3 year old enjoys this game. What a fun game!
1932100660|5.0|I bought this as an audio book to listen to on a long trip.  I found myself sitting in the truck when I got there to keep listening.  Really eye opening stuff here.  I've gone plant based for a few weeks, and definitely feel a difference!<br /><br />I liked it so much, I bought the paperback version for my girlfriend.
B009LDXQGW|5.0|The album was great and exactly what I expected. It shipped within 3 days and the package wasn't damaged at all.
B00127RAJY|5.0|These workouts are one of the best I have done, I actually starting working out with Jillian, she is one of my favorite trainers.
B008HK3XKO|4.0|,.This cover seems to hold the kindle nicely, and it also looks very nice(I got the black). Some people have said that when put their kindle in with the camera to the left, that it affects the sleep and wake function, but I have not experienced this. I would have given it 5 stars if it protected my kindle a little better
B004TTZHBK|4.0|I appreciate the healthy and easy to prepare recipes listed in this app. It makes it easy to follow and easy to eat well. It loses 1 star due to minor technical difficulties occasionally - but nothing to detract from the quality of the meals.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|A great America tell his life story so all can understand and appreciate the hardships endured by the America service members in the fight to keep America free
0679805273|5.0|When was the last time you read Dr Suess?  He is certainly full of life's wisdom! We bought this for niece who was leaving for college.  She loved the book and ......I must admit, my husband and I read it outloud before we gave to her.  We loved it, too!
B008S4YZCO|5.0|You can get your own monsters and train them. You can also feed them and play with them!! It has cute graphics and is entertaining and enjoyable. It is very creative. The monsters are adorable! The only problem is I don't know how to earn crystals. Overall well worth the taken space.
B006K5JALE|5.0|This series has been my favorite since i was a little kid.  Even though its classified as a \\"horror\\", i think of it as a comedy.  They have alot of comic relief.
B005SVVANW|5.0|My brother is a rock n roll junkie and loves puzzles. This is perfect and while he is making his kids help him, he will be teaching them more of the history of rock!
0525478817|5.0|This book was absolutely amazing. John Green is such an amazing author and after reading his first novel, Looking For Alaska, I felt the need to read every book he'd ever written. I couldn't put this book down, and I am happy to say it took me less than a day to finish it. I love it.
B009NQKPUW|4.0|Loved the premise, great action sequences and just enough gore to make this a must watch for sci fi/ thriller fans.
B0087JTAKW|5.0|This is the story of three seemingly unrelated people whose lives intersect over a New Years eve and the days, weeks, months leading up to it.  I LOVED the story of Lor, Sarah and Victor each one trying to manipulate time the one thing that cannot be controlled.  The book was wonderful and the characters very well written.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|One of the best made series out there. Truly fantastic! Not only are the setting and the acting fabulous, but the characters are especially engaging, not something you see much of these days.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|I loved reading this book. I thought It was one of my favorite books in the series!! I enjoyed reading it!! I would highly recommend it!! :)
B000056IEW|5.0|got this cheap because of the region rating. my bluray plays them all. will buy other discs out of our region because they tend to be cheaper. LOVE this movie.
B0044C3RB4|5.0|good value for whole season picture is great streaming on the internet and very low lag was a great deal
B00006FDCD|5.0|another of my additions to the SK collection. got a few to go. will keep on searching for good buys. this one was $7
B005LAII80|4.0|I liked the action in this movie, the plot, and the use of slow motion.  I am a Karl Urban fan and thought his acting talent was somewhat wasted in this movie.  Seeing him in Star Trek, R.E.D., and even the Chronicles of Riddick showed his talent.  This &#34;Judge Dredd&#34; was not a good use of his talent.  Overall, the movie was entertaining and the 3D showed great on my TV.
B0079R8KO0|5.0|My Kindle has held up well to a lot of travel without being in any kind of protective case or sleeve. Still, I thought it would be prudent to give the screen and case a little more protection.<br /><br />It's a snap (literally) to install the Kindle in the case. It's not too large or thick. It works as described and is very convenient. I've ordered a second one for my wife's Kindle.
B005OCHOZS|4.0|Scott Jurek is known for two things, primarily:  following a vegan diet, and running (and winning) ultramarathons.  So when Scott Jurek writes a book called &#34;Eat and Run: My Unlikely Journey to Ultramarathon Greatness&#34;, one should expect all other aspects of Jurek's life rendered erroneous.  If you are looking for detailed descriptions of Jurek's relationship with his sarcastic and rebellious best friend, ex-wife, father, mother, or current girlfriend, you will have to wait for his next book.  A book which, I might add, will seem completely irrelevant and pointless coming from a man known primarily for being a vegan and running ultramarathons.<br /><br />Conversely, Scott Jurek is not known for being a writer.  The writing is simple and often repetitive, like a mantra one might silently chant while fighting inner demons and physical fatigue during a 100+ mile race.  A solitary sport, running leaves one plenty of time for contemplation.  Jurek revisits the same themes and even the same phrases over and over again, which can lead to some tedious reading.  However, the repetition actually helped create a consistent narrative - Jurek's running became the inner and outer representation of his quest to answer the big questions in life.<br /><br />As someone who has been known to pound the pavement from time to time, I can appreciate the mental fortitude required to accomplish even a 3-miler, let alone an ultramarathon.  Jurek clearly knows what it means to endure.  His stories are genuine and honest, and though he tends to focus on his race victories and underplay the defeats, the victories are the better and more triumphant stories - the ones that recall the power of the human spirit.  Plus, Jurek is known for winning, not losing.<br /><br />The vegan recipes and running tips at the end of each chapter remind the reader that the purpose of this novel is not just a narcissistic recount of Jurek's greatness - he also wishes to educate and inspire.  Indeed, after reading this book, not only do I have a fresh variety of tasty vegan dishes to mix into the weekly meal routine, but I'm also experiencing a renewed vigor to get out there and log some miles.
1567184855|5.0|Journey of Souls: Case Studies of Life Between Lives is a wonderful and a opener for all readers to another dimension and inner peace....thank you.
B005OCFGTO|5.0|Great movies and I had been waiting until they all came in one set so I could by them all at once for less. Like the way the company chose to package the discs into one hard case not in sleeves or individual packages. Makes for a slimmer case to fit right in with the rest of your movies. Case is about he size of two normal DVD cases.
B003N0XDT4|4.0|I got this DAC amplifier and was having many of the same problems other reviewers were experiencing:  unit didn't appear to charge, battery indicator flickered when plugged in, unit didn't operate at all unless plugged in.  This was how it operated for the first 36 hours.  I was frustrated with it and about to send it back when, on a whim, I decided to try it again after it had been charging overnight.  It worked!  And it's been working fine for about a week now.  I'm still going to keep a watchful eye on it and if it fails again, I will return it.  But for now, I have no complaints.  If you have a similar problem, I suggest allowing it to charge for at least a day (maybe 2) and then see how it works.<br /><br />Oh, and it sounds great too!
B0058YPL66|5.0|I bought this for my 12 year old grandaughter who spent one whole Sunday watching it.  I'll buy the next season, as well.  It is a quality DVD.
B009NQKPUW|5.0|Ridley Scott does it right No computer CG crap everything is made it shows it It was long waiting but it was worth it it's a great movie And I highly recommended How I give it 5 stars
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|This show is amazing. There are so many twists & turns that u never really know what to expect next! I am gonna be so sad when this season is over!
0399160450|4.0|This was a Christmas gift for my daughter.  I am sure will enjoy the book very much.  She enjoys Tom Clancy books.  I cannot rate this book fairly as it is not for me.
B0091REZMW|5.0|I love it even though I'm at a point where purchasing things with real money is nessessary which I wont be doing I still have fun with it
0385535147|4.0|This book was for a gift for my daughter for Christmas.  I cannot rate it fairly since it is not for me.  She really enjoys this author.
B002OFWG7E|4.0|Good CD, just not the songs I expected.  Will get some more foo fighters cause THEY ROCK!!!  IT arrived quickly
B000FC2KL0|5.0|An amazing life story that is still being lived today. Addiction is a terrible thing but you can survive it thorough hard work and dedication. AK is living proof of that!<br />It's a book worth reading even if you're not a RHCP fan.
0765325950|5.0|It was everything I hoped for.  The last two (which I didn't like) were all a build up to this one.  The entire book is one giant battle scene.  Don't start reading unless you have a vast amount of time to dedicate.  Wow.  Tai'daishar Mr. Jordan and thanks Sanderson for getting the job done!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I'm speechless, this book was amazing! Had such a great storyline that wraps you deeper and deeper into the book. Definitely one of the best I have read!
B009G7ZYPY|5.0|She has such an amazing voice.  I love listening to her.  I love it.  Great songs and such a great voice
B0095ZMMCK|1.0|You can sure tell this is not up toTom Clancy standards.  Since this is part of an ongoing series  you would think they would get basic storyline facts correct. for example  Jack Jr is NOT the oldest Child  Sally is
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|The games is great. I would willingly pay for this game. However, I'm not crazy about the bate and switch. It says &quot;free&quot;,  but then you're forced to pay if you want to finish the game. The description should let you know that it's virtually a free trial. It's worth the money,  despite this pet peeve.
B009O07NDY|5.0|I probably can't add much on the comments that went into great detail about each song, but I loved this CD.<br /><br />Bottom line is that if you liked what you heard in the movie buy it. If you enjoyed the other Lord of the Rings soundtracks then you'll most likely enjoy this one too.<br /><br />I chose to buy the special edition because I'm a huge fan of the Hobbit and all things Middle Earth so I chose to spend the little extra money buying the pretty case and the extended songs. I listen to it a lot and think it was worth every cent.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|A fantastic read from the opening line to the final scene.  I am a great fan of dark humour and this story had lots! Thought provoking and an almost 100% believable story line.  I don't think I could ever hear a &#34;disco&#34; song again without recalling a part of this story - makes you look at potatoes in a new light as well!  Our hero, although a biologist by trade, can certainly turn his hand to just about anything and most of it without the help of the scientists on earth.  Goes to show what you can do when you have no other options and death is lurking just around the corner.  We were cheering him on whenever something went right and groaning in dismay when it didn't.<br /><br />My partner is also reading this book and thoroughly enjoying it and he is not a sci-if fan.<br /><br />Tried to find another book by this author but so far it looks like there is nothing else - what a pity.  Would love to see this book made into a movie.
0345529057|4.0|I really like these books (Feast for Crows annoyed me at points but it was still good). I already own the books, but I bought this set for a friend for Christmas because she wanted to start reading them. It's a great price for the first 4 books and I was able to stay within our budget for gifts. My friend was really excited to get these since now she has the first 4 books so she doesn't have to buy any herself for awhile.<br /><br />I personally own the larger paperback set because I find fat books annoying as mass market paperbacks because the spines crack more, but that's a personal preference which is why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5. My friend didn't care so she was happy to get these.
1442474440|5.0|I am familiar with this edition in the dust jacket, deckle edge version.  The updated binding gives it a fresh, updated appearance with the same text and timeless Wyeth illustrations.  Gave it to a friend's 11 year-old son who is delighted!
B001ANYDAO|5.0|I was really surprised by many of the facts pointed out by this book and Gladwell is very insightful as usual.
B007TXN4TK|4.0|I am not musically inclined, but this was  fun app that I could share with the 7, 5 & 4 year old grandkids.
034580404X|5.0|I purchase this book for my husband for a christmas gift. I love the book and I hope he will too!
B0017SWSCW|5.0|A thoroughly enjoyable tale with enough twists and turns to satisfy every Archer fan as well as first timers. This man is definitely a superb storyteller. With elements reminiscent of both The Count of Monte Cristo  and The Shawshank Redemption , this is a novel for anyone who enjoys a book that keeps you hooked to the final full stop.
B005CRQ4GU|2.0|Great book I loved it read it three times I read it to my siblings and they all love it
B00899DR40|5.0|I downloaded this for my grandchildren to listen to when they come to my home.<br />I have several music choices for them to listen to, but they always choose :Believe\\" over the others.<br />They listen, sing and dance to it, so it must be really good.
B005NF2UE6|5.0|I love Nickleback and their unique sound.  They have their own musical style and I love every song on this CD.  Listen to it every day.
B0073LWEXK|5.0|Beautiful, wonderful puzzles, nice music and not an impossible to solve game.  Of all the games I've played so far, this is my favorite and hope to find more like it.
0811874192|5.0|I love pop-up books and thought this one would be cool.  My grandaughters also love these books and they are so careful.  the books are fragile.
B004FOA84A|5.0|I've just started playing these kinds of games on my new Kindle Fire.  I enjoyed this one very much and look forward to the next chapter game.
B001AW156U|5.0|These add ons really increase the control on the bottom triggers.  Made it alot easier to use the triggers -improved gameplay.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|I really enjoyed playing this game.  It was the first one I played on my new Kindle Fire.  The music was great, graphics are bright and beautiful and it was a good mystery story.  Good puzzles too.
B003ZTQN1I|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie and the songs that Garrett Hedlund sings are fabulous.  Gwenneth did a fabulous job too.  Really enjoed this.
B00005JM02|2.0|I was so looking forward to watching this one and it was defective.  The CD would not play.  I was very disappointed and I am returning it.<br /><br />Susan Kaylor
B003UESJ9M|5.0|I enjoyed the movie so much that I bought both the soundtracks for the film.  I have really enjoyed the music even though I am not a country music fan.
B009O07NDY|5.0|O.K. This is going to be short and sweet here 'cause I'm not a critic. This is Really Great Great music. 5 Stars......Epic.
B009KHBDUU|2.0|Good but the story sucked. Pun inteaded Once of those movie you just had to see if it was true what they said about it
B006LSZECO|4.0|Had to buy it on Kindle so I could finish it on vacation. Thought it was a good take on the genre.
B006LSZECO|5.0|A disturbing novel with many unexpected twists.  I enjoyed it and would recommend.  Just when you think you know what will happen, you are taken by surprise.
B00ADS98FC|3.0|I liked it, but i wasn't a BIG WOW for me... Theres some funny parts, its a kinda corny movie.. If you really like Glee accapella, this is the Movie for you.
B007HACDLK|5.0|I have read all of Vince Flynn's books.  Mitch Rapp is a great protagonist.  If you like this, you will like Jack Reacher (Lee Child's hero).
B007SGLZP8|4.0|Amazing book, captivating from page one. The ending is awesome. If you want a book you can 't put down,this is it.
B008DM4OTA|5.0|you wish medical procedures can be this simple.  but my kids really like to play with it.  the graphics are simple and the plot is a little thin (only handful of scenarios over and over)
B007W8S2MG|5.0|This game is epic its the perfect jrpg.<br />I recommend this game to any anime fan<br />And the game will last u over 60 hours of pure fun.
B009JZTOG8|5.0|I loved season 1!  I am enjoying season 2.  Finally up-to-date!  I love the way all the fairy tale stories interact with one another.
B0086700CM|3.0|Hi everyone. At first, this temple run game was soooo addictive and cool. I thought that everyone who said tilting on the kindle fire didn't work was wrong because it worked for me. But now the tilting doesn't work! I am sad now because tilting on temple run doesn't work now.  Please fix this problem and then I will play this game a lot more. ;-(
B003VXPIXW|5.0|I had this book read to be as a toddler and I plan on reading it all the time to my kids:)
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|At first I had a face-palm moment because I thought I accidentally downloaded an awkward high school romance but man was I wrong. This book was fantastic, cute, sad, etc... I love the characters. No was was to whiny or over dramatic. I loved him,loved her, and loved the way they loved. Great book.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book. It was really well-written. I like the detail she put in. It made me feel like I was there sharing the experience with Katniss & Peeta. I look forward to reading the next two books.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|Best book ever! I can't believe how amazing this was! It was also the first book I read on my kindle and I loved reading it on there ! :)
B007NU54H4|5.0|My 10 year old daughter has to whole series.  As a result, I have watched them all with her.  Must admit that this is the best of the series. Great story line,  Excellent quality. Very happy with this purchase.
B009LXEBD4|5.0|All of her bests song on a cd cannot get better than that. Def worth the purchase of this cd
B009FZFONO|5.0|Completely exceeded my expectations.  This was recommended by several friends and I put it off thinking it would not be interesting. Glad I took the plunge, and have not been disappointed.
B003ZJ0ZX0|2.0|I guess I like a few songs but should have just downloaded those songs individually. At least he's a great artist.
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|Great game if your trying to kill time! Helps the mind thing how to beat the game. The birds are cute!
B0018QQQK8|5.0|Total surprise ending. I was so mad for about two pages but with a twist everything was fixed. Great book
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|Was hooked within minutes.  Graphics good and mini challenges fun.  Grateful for hints.  Would like more similar games.  Found it not too easy and yet not too difficult.
B007BVOEPI|5.0|Wonderful  can not wait until season 2 arrives. Our son sent this to us knowing we would like this it is on the same line as Lord of the Rings.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book was fabulous! It was different from my normal reads and it made me laugh, cry and surprise me. Will be looking into reading more books by this author.
B0083ZRAJS|5.0|It was very different than the movie, but it is even more amazing! I would read it over and over again and still want more! I would recommend it for many people, and pokemon!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This app is a lot of fun not only for me but also my 7 year old!<br />Can't wait to try the bridges version.
B0063IH60K|5.0|just loaded this in my Kindle and play it on my phone too. My grandkids love it too. I like how the card placements change with the orientation of the device.
B005O7PXNS|5.0|BEST ON TV, FUN TO WATCH,MY WIFE IS JELOUS OF KATE. CASTLE IS THE MAN WHAT A LUCKY DUDE, COFFEE ANYONE
B009EHDU7U|5.0|quirky, engaging, laugh out loud.  Enjoyed the descriptions and language used, as well as the entertaining story line.  Worth a read.
B0066W1AZK|5.0|I simply love it amazing. An amazing puzzle game and I can't say that I hate it cause that would be a lie.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I loved the book so much more then the movie. Katniss is such a strong young girl that you can't help but love her.
B002WSR8A8|5.0|This is a great album and the message in the music still goes in today's life. Something never change in human emotions.
B000N2HBSO|5.0|I have always been a history buff,especially the civil war and Team of Rivals has lived up to a my idea of nonfiction book of the war. It bought insight into not only Lincoln, but his cabinet.
0765325950|3.0|Please do a little reading first (specifically Brandon Sanderson's blog).  The delay of the ebook was a decision made by Robert Jordan's widow to try to protect his legacy.  Agree or disagree, it wasn't motivated by greed or a bad publisher, but by the person with the most stake in this book doing well.  Please stop whining and giving the book a low ranking because your favorite format isn't available!  We've waited this long for the end, either buy a hardcover or just wait in silence, please<br /><br />I haven't finished the book yet, (though it's wonderful thus far) so the star ranking reflects more my desire to not modify the rating than how I feel about the book.
B004J4WLB4|5.0|I enjoyed every part of this book, though I got a bit frustrated by the adults who seem to be so ready to give up on a child. We chose this book for our book club and I will look forward to a lively discussion in many different directions.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|A great read.  Way more details than than the movie, we get to find out how Katniss feels and thinks.
B000DZ6VAK|3.0|She's a wonderful pianist -- and, I know, a renowned Mozart specialist.  But her playing is too d___d delicate.  Not for me.
B007EECSFA|3.0|This book has a slow start.  It gives information in the first few pages but doesn't grab you until half way through the book.
B008K6HN8I|5.0|Made it possible to get a quick look at all files on my Kindle. A very helpful app for me.
0765325950|5.0|Heaven forbid that the publisher makes a buck off a 900-page book before selling it to e-babies for 99 cents. It's about time that publishers got a backbone. If the movie industry released their latest hit at the theater on the same day that they released it on DVD and network television, we'd have no movie industry left. Is that what we want to happen to books? Personally, I can't wait for Robert Jordan's doorstop to arrive at my neighborhood books store (remember those?).
B004FK24ZA|4.0|The product was good. I honestly did not know it had Korean titles, so I was a little disappointed in that, but I obviously did not read everything before I purchased it. But, the seller was great! The first copy I got did not work and they immediately sent me another one, which did work. They were great to work with. I would definitely recommend them!
0316227706|3.0|and the pics were fantastic - but for a photobook, the layout was not so good  - on a few of the pics the focal point (the dog's face) was right in the crease when it was a 2 page pic - there had to be a better way to do it.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Use this calculator for quick mathematical problems.  It is a standard calculator with addition, subtraction, mutiplication and division.  Easy to use.
B0076DCT2G|1.0|This was SO disappointing and a waste of time and money! I have enjoyed most of his books, but story line is weaker and relying on too much smart aleck dialogue.
B0091REZMW|5.0|I just started playing this and it is fun.  A mystery takes place and you get clues to find hidden objects and you walk through different rooms.  Looks like it will be lots of fun.
B0061QD82E|5.0|There were no issues with this shipment! Everything came on time and neatly packaged--no complaints about this product at all.
B00AQ3K8IU|2.0|This a book for the ladies.  I pushed the wrong button and accidentally bought it.  It may be fun for a 17 year old.
B000F8O35U|2.0|I ordered this DVD for my 5 year old daughter for x-mas because she loves the Little Mermaid but never actually saw the movie. The DVD that we recieved was not the original, it had scratches on it and kept skipping. We tried the DVD on multipe dvd players and tried wiping it as well. Thankfully, Amazon refunded my money on this one so I could buy from a different seller.
B00AE2LJVS|5.0|Such a good movie! I was pleasantly surprised by Shia LaBeouf's performance, and the guy that play's his brother Forrest is amazing. A must see for sure!
B009CG3M1C|5.0|If you like action and special effects, then you'll definitely like this movie. I enjoyed it<br /><br />so much that I rented it on pay for view, bought it for my Kindle and bought the Dvd.
B007VYDFMS|5.0|The emotions, the images, the interviews with Bob... All perfectly blended together in one amazing viewing experience... I will watch this over and over again.
B009NT0I06|5.0|Ordered this album for my daughter. Nice pics inside the cover. Shipped on time. Would buy again. Music is great as well.
B007KCG7MQ|5.0|Keeping up with times. A True musian. Continues to a share his life and thoughts through Music. You won't be dissapointed.
B004ZNARH4|5.0|This is a very good set to buy if you are a Pink Floyd fan.  All of the hits are in this set and the extras are very cool!!!
B0017SWPXY|4.0|This book had a good flow and the story had a good story line with character development.  The first person canine was an interesting touch, and kept you reading.
030758836X|5.0|Twisting and turning until the very end!  Intriguing! I would recommend this book. Looking forward to more of her novels.
B001YYQ9SS|5.0|I rating it as 5 starts because my friend who bought them was crazy about them. Also I heard no complains at all, at least till now.
B001EN71CW|5.0|If you're looking for one of the greatest Sci-Fi series, start here. There is a reason why nearly 4,000 people have reviewed this product and it has 5 stars.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|I listen to a lot of music on youtube, but I have never really purchased any CDs from the stuff I hear on it.<br />But I just knew I had to get the CD from Piano Guys...and it totally did not disappoint!<br /><br />Don't even hesitate to buy this guys, it's worth it!
0393061310|5.0|It has been a couple of years since I read this book, and I find myself referring to it in conversations, so it must have made an impact on me.  An easy read, and a real mind-stretcher.
B00A11AN6O|1.0|Has your kindlefire&reg; broken down before? did you have to return it over and over? here's a tip so that ur kindle doesn't break anymore: don't get more than 5 free apps. if you do, they'll slow down your kindle and cause it not to work anymore. the same applies to free books. don't get too many. hope that I helped! (btw, apps and books that you buy shouldn't cause problems.) this isn't a review for the app btw. its for the kindlefire.
B00AKOB7CG|5.0|This app has made my New Year Resolution easy to keep! I can see myself reaching my fitness goals and that's thanks to this app.
B00AMBH70S|5.0|Great movie full of suspense and action.  Would definitely recommend especially if you have seen the other Bourne movies previously.
B0006N2EZ0|4.0|this is a movie that will keep you thinking, it gives you an idea what singers life is all about.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|It was hard to put this one down, I read it in 3 days and that's a record. There was a little sadness that I wasn't expecting but would definately recommend it!
B000MQ54OY|4.0|I would recommend this movie to anyone who likes music and animation. Its a cute movie and the story awesome
B005GFPZYK|4.0|Very interesting read.  Would highly suggest if you would like an inside look at the war from a personal perspective.
B006CR2PD0|5.0|Greaaaaaat!!! :D I couldnt find it anywehere else and I got it here, the un cut version and blue ray... cant be better!!!
B00A9X9TIW|2.0|Sick & Stupid Score: 5/8*<br /><br />This picture lost itself after about 30 minutes.  Perhaps there is no better confirmation of the confused nature of time travel movies than an admission by the screenwriters that the concept is simply too screwy to explain.  That is what we get at least twice during this movie: scenes between various characters trying to puzzle out how time travel works, especially when you are supposed to kill your future self.  Never mind, the scriptwriters tell us.  Don't try to diagram it out.  We were totally stoned when we wrote the story, anyway.<br /><br />What is this story?  It is bits and pieces from science fiction and horror movie ideas of the last 30 years or more:  a little bit of Matrix and Dark City (mostly costumes), a little bit of Star Wars (jet-powered motorcycles), how about some Damien (The Omen) or a blood-soaked little boy version of Carrie?  Poltergeist anyone?  Futuristic psychedelic drugs?  Ugh.  Not to mention the 50 other time travel movies out there that make no sense.  Get an original idea, please.<br /><br />So the present is the 2040s--or maybe it is the past.  And the future is the 2070s--or maybe it is the present.  People from the future (present?) are being sent back to the present (past?) for execution.  That works for about 30 minutes, if you are adjusting the surround sound by moving furniture around your living room and not paying any attention to the movie.  After that, with the totally cool idea of \\"loopers\\" totally exhausted, the movie wanders around hopelessly, desperately searching for a way to fill out another 60 minutes of reel time, no pun intended.<br /><br />Note to Bruce Willis fans:  Even though he is given top billing, he is actually in a supporting role.<br />______________________________<br />* The Sick & Stupid Score ranks movies from zero to ten in each category. For example, a Sick & Stupid Score of 5/5 indicates the movie is about average Sick and about average Stupid. A Score of 10/10 indicates the movie is so gross and idiotic no one should watch it; whereas a Score of 0/0 is a perfect movie.indicates the movie is so gross and idiotic no one should watch it; whereas a Score of 0/0 is a perfect movie.
B006FO3ERQ|4.0|First part superb. Second not bad, but not stellar. And the story simply loses credability when the two gentlemen from the US are being written into the picture.<br />But overall the best book I have read in a long time
B007XKEY6Q|4.0|I love this game I play it all the time. But, it needs the update so bad it wont let me play for like 9 coins because its not updated!! p
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This is also a must read. Suzanne Collins has really out did herself with this series! I couldn't put either of theses books down I know that the movies will be great, but not as great as these books.....May even read theses series again down the road
B002IU4TLQ|5.0|My daughter has had it awhile and shows it to all her friends. The quality was great and this movie is my Fav. It also got here super quick in spite of the holidays.  Where else can you get this service without hunting everywhere.<br />rita-MN
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|Good book, the ending wasn't the one. you expect but its the realistic one. The ending isn't fulfilling in the sense of closure but that's the point of it, that she never really gets part it.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|This was yet another great read from Grisham.....I couldn't put it down. Would make a great movie. If you are a Grisham fan....and even if you are not..... it's a must.
B0063IH60K|5.0|It's super fun. I love playing it and I have no problems with it and I think that anyone who loves solitaire  will love it.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Gillian Flynn is a very talented writer.  This is the first book of hers that I have red.  Had a lot of trouble putting it down.
0307719219|4.0|I am a layman in the field of economics, but fairly well-read in history.  This book does a very good job of intertwining both into a central thesis of why nations fail.  I hated this book when I first picked it up.  The reason: I expected something that read less like an academic journal and more like prose.  However, I gave it a chance and actually enjoyed it (and learned a few things in the process).  This is a dry read, but thought provoking (I use that term literally).  I would enjoy reading this author's take on the \\"Arab Spring\\" and how that relates to the political and historical economy of the Middle East.  Overall, a decent book!
B005K0HDGE|4.0|It was hard to put down.  This is definitely classic Stephen King.  I have recommended this book to several people.
030758836X|2.0|Written for the young adult as content lacks body.  Not even an easy read.  Too much to remember that I did not. Care to think about.  Not believable.
B00457WZEI|5.0|Kept my interest from the start!!  Great story!! Such a great read to share with my daughter, Meg, and for her to learn some history.
B000YJ54DU|5.0|THE STORY IS FLUID AND KEEPS YOU MOVING THRU EACH CHAPTER TO FIND THE REAL BAD GUYS AND WHO WILL SURVIVE.
034580404X|3.0|The product arrived in a timely manner. The first book was a fast read. The second book did not hold my interest so I have not read the third book yet.
B001NLL8LA|5.0|i HAVE READ EVERYTHING THAT LEE CHILD HAS WRITTEN. THE JACK REACHER CHARACTER IS ALWAYS INTERESTING AND THE OTHER CHARACTERS ARE WELL DEVELOPED.
B004SD5GZ4|5.0|This adobe is like the others... I was hoping I would be able to have access to  Adobe Flash as well to be able to take this to a whole other level... It's a good thing though with a Kindle
B009HQ9UHC|4.0|Love the game.  Very challenging.  My 4 year old grandson loves it.  Really makes him use his head and think.<br />Tells Nana how to play.  Good purchase.
B0096PYUE2|3.0|I uploaded/downloaded this thinking I'd be able to view live services and I haven't been able to view anything live w my kindle
B009VB97EY|1.0|The film style was lacking.  There were not many close-ups so it was hard to get into the story without that effect of &#34;being in the moment&#34; with the characters.  I was expecting a cute love story, but there was no chemistry between the Magic Mike (Channing Tatum) and Brooke (Cody Horn).  Of course there were sexy men in the film, but it's not enough to keep you interested in the film.  Overall, it was money poorly spent and it's two hours I'll never get back.
1451648537|5.0|NICE BOOK AND BARES ALOT OF HIS SIMPLE BUT INTELLIGENTS AND MISTAKES ..IT HAS GREAT DESCRIPTIONS OFG HIM AND HIS OPTIONS IN HIS CAREER..REad it..sassy lee
B0058YPGL6|5.0|I was leery about this show. I am NOT a fan of werewolves, but I heard how funny Stiles was, and I had to watch the show for myself. I am so glad I bought and watched it. The show is fast paced action with great a writing team behind them. I am looking forward to watching season 2 as soon as I can buy it.
030758836X|4.0|Some audio books disappoint. The folks hired to read are dull or don't fit the characters. I have to say that listening to Gone Baby read by or more aptly, performed by Julia Whelan and Kirby Heyborne was an absolutely delight. In fact, the characters whom some found dislikable in print were simply intriguing as read by Whelan & Heyborne.  Whelan as Amy was phenomenal and a hoot. I found myself laughing aloud several times. Heyborne as Nick was equally enjoyable. It took me a bit to get into the story but once I did, I never looked back nor regretted it. In fact, on more than one occasion, I found myself sitting in the car well after my commute just to find out what will happen next. I wish more professional readers would take an active role in actually performing the novel rather than just reading it. Oh yeah, the story itself was very good as well. Totally unexpected at every turn.
B005779X4U|4.0|Nice garbage container that looks great in the kitchen.  However, the price is a little high.  It should include someone that takes the garbage out for you.
B00005N6RU|1.0|It will not load into my player, so it's useless.  The box is nice but you can't play the box
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I have reccomened this book to all my friends. I read it in 2days! I loved slammed and point of retreat too!
B007W7P5L8|4.0|She seemed to have liked it.  Marware makes a good product and my mom, wife and myself all use Marware cases for our Kindle Fires
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I absolutely love this series and season two did not disappoint. Can't wait until I see season r<br />Three. One of the best shows p TV today.
B002VQ7PVS|4.0|This is a story that should be read by all daughters.  So often we assume that the woman who bore us and raised us is a one dementional  caretaker.  This piece of fiction forces us to see our mothers as people....women who have lives above and beyond simple maternity and childrearing.  I enjoyed this book so very much.
B002R5LKOQ|5.0|It is a great thriller with Whitney Houston and Kevin Costner. Very enjoyable. It will keep you on the edge of your seat. Plus, you hear Whitney sing some of her songs.
B009KHDT0C|5.0|I Love any movie from Tim Burton, this one is definitely another one for my growing collection! This movie is dark,funny and groovy as...well you get the idea! :) Get It** Watch It** Love It!
0756688701|5.0|Bought this book for my grandson, didn't know it was part box, part book. Car is included in the box part. Still a great item though. My grandson keeps it with where ever he goes. Pictures and descriptions of each car from both movies. I am going to buy one more for my other grandson.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|I check Facebook regularly, and it is great to have it on my Kindle Fire.  Much easier than keeping up with a laptop.  I don't have a fancy phone, so this is my way of having what I need away from home.
B009ERK1T0|5.0|I looked up what it meant in Japanese:<br /><br />\\"Koi No Yokan is a truly beautiful concept. It can defined the sense can have upon first meeting another person that the two of them are going to fall in love. In other words, it is the knowledge one has that he/she is going to fall in love with another person. This differs from the idea \\"love at first sight\\" in that it does not imply that the feeling of love exists, rather it refers to the knowledge that a future love is inevitable.\\"<br /><br />This is EXACTLY how I feel about the album.  It didn't jump out at me with a \\"Rocket Skates\\" kind of song, but after hearing it once I am sure it will be one of my absolute favorite albums.
B0019UGYK0|5.0|This is not only a great movie but a great DVD edition of this movie that I can finally watch in widescreen like it was originally intended shown.
B008FPOIT6|5.0|I was just looking for something different when I read this book. It started off odd, but interesting. Then when the &#34;Mystery&#34; appears, all aspects of putting the book down is almost impossible. Love when a book relates to land marks in cities. Makes it feel real.
B009HELT3C|3.0|This is Not nearly as good as the previous two.  Plus there seemed to be a lot more Language that my kids should not hear!!!  Was very displeased!!!
B003O86FMW|5.0|I think that the author writes very well. This book never got boring. Each of the characters in the book were very well thought of
B004GHNIRK|3.0|A nice classic. Only a little wordy which seems the norm for this genre.<br />All in all, enjoyable. Worth reading.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Honestly my favorite romance novel yet. Best book in a while. READ IT YOU WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED :)  story is amazing and you fall in love with the characters
B005K17RU0|5.0|Great app! Love the accuracy of the weather forecasts. I use this app locally and for travel as well. This has come in very handy for planning vacations.
B007GCY8FS|5.0|I've been with this series since the first one - Killing Floor - and Lee Child continues to grab you and not let go. It was hard to put this book now because I didn't want it to end. The amazing fact is Lee Child always finds some way to top the previous book with an exciting story.
B005VTS4EY|4.0|It seems that there is an endless supply of puzzles to solve.  This game is a good way to pass a few idle moments.
B0076DELIG|5.0|Michael Connelly never disappoints. Sometimes a few too many characters but I can usually keep up. :) Great writer and keeps the readers interest.
B0076DCT2G|5.0|I found it a quick read, and very interesting, particularly the facts about Yemen.<br />I enjoyed the quick wit of the character.
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|Great movie and the picture was excellent on my Kindle Fire HD! Downloaded directly to my device so I could watch anytime.
B007UXSPK2|4.0|I have enjoyed all of the Mission Impossible films and this one did not disappoiint.  It is one that I would see again
B008XG1X18|4.0|I'm on Pintrest as much as any app I use! I'm addicted to it. Mostly I've used the recipes I find on it but it's a great addition. A few tweaks to the layout on the kindle edition would be nice (view of my own boards, etc) but overall I use it constantly and it's very consistent.
B001AW156U|5.0|They went on in a snap (see what I just did there?)<br /><br />They are a must have for ANY type of game play!
B004HHKFIY|5.0|My son loves Chugginton and trains.  I was looking for something smaller that I could throw in the diaper bag and take anywhere.  This is exactly what I needed.  It's perfect to go anywhere, great size for his small hands.  He loves it!
0803729227|5.0|we had other Julia Donaldson stories and this too has become a favorite.  very sweet story a little longer and more complex than the other stories that we have by her.
B004Q0SQ24|5.0|My son loves Chugginton and trains.  I was looking for something smaller that I could throw in the diaper bag and take anywhere.  This is exactly what I needed.  It's perfect to go anywhere, great size for his small hands.  He loves it!
B008D28HYS|5.0|Love this app, I'm addicted, it starts easy and gets harder but never gets to were you can't do it, always adding new pictures, keep wanting to do more to find out what picture I'm going to make next
B004I744AS|5.0|Searching for an app that met all my needs I found this.It has a perfect layout, excellent for quick searches, it is more than a dictionary. Translating from Spanish was a pleasant surprise how accurate it is. I have a Nexus 10 and it works like a charm.
B000W0YWRK|5.0|I have been playing this CD for years.  It never gets old.  Love it! I wish they would do another one this good.
B001GZ6QC4|5.0|as always bat man is amazing, and this movie was full of action. a must have for any comic loving movie lover
B004LOMB2Q|1.0|App never downloaded onto my Kindle. Free or not, I expect it to \\"get here.\\"  Got another app instead.  I don't understand.  It's the only download problem I've had so far.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Wonderful escape.  Viewed it twice.  Keep the episodes coming.  &#34;Loosen up Mary, all will be well.&#34;  Downton Abbey is a winner.
0152023984|5.0|One of the great books for children and adults.  It has fantasy from a child's perspective as well as a number of wise messages for adults who take the time to look for them.
B009HV2JT8|3.0|Dominic Cooper looks great with his shirt off for all of 1 minute - the bulk of the movie is killing vampires and revenge for a mother taken. It had some very great moments and a lot of gratuitous violence.
B002TLSSXO|5.0|I love Joseph Joseph products and this one is definitely one of the best - the heat resistant utensils are of high quality, they work perfectly as described and they are gorgeous. Highly recommended for every kitchen.
1401235417|5.0|I am a huge Batman fan and this story to start the New 52 is real good. It was quite the page turner as the story progresses and the artwork is real good too!
B009K0P10K|5.0|This TV show is absolutely amazing. Everyone I recommend it to has like it and has been hooked within just a few episodes. If you enjoy an amazing plot and a twisted story this is for you
0062213423|5.0|Bought for a younger cousin this book filled her with new knowledge about her favorite band and it made her Christmas.
B008Z9YLV2|5.0|Great movie but recommend reading the book for what was left out.  It will be better understood.  Make sure you read the beginning lines or you will be lost.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|I really enjoyed reading this book.  A great sci-fi adventure with an astronaut stranded on Mars and all the chaos he had to deal with.  I have to say there was alot of math involved in this book, which at times I had to skip over since it seemed over my head, but all in all thought it was a great book.
B000OZ0NXA|4.0|I recently saw the new movie with Tom Cruise, &#34;Jack Reacher&#34; and loved it.  This is my first book by Lee Child and I really enjoyed his style of writing.  He kept it moving, exciting, with just enough twist and turns.  I look forward to the next book.
B001KDQ4KQ|5.0|The Pact  was easy reading.  It was hard to put down.  Could not wait to see how the story line would end.  I am excited to read more of Jodi's books.
B007EECSFA|4.0|Very good book.  Enjoyed.  Sometimes had trouble keeping up with who was talking, but the twist at the end was worth it!!
B0065GC0BA|5.0|Loved this book. Kept me on my toes. This was my first book by Jojo Moyes. Looking forward to reading more of her books. Story well told. It was a sensitive subject but was well wrote. Louisa was a darling.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Read the first part of Wool. You'll be hooked the same way the TV show LOST kept you coming back. That desire to know what's next, what's out there, is so enticing.

B00APUU7S0|4.0|WE ENJOYED THE SHOW.  IF YOU LIKE ACTION GO AHEAD AND RENT THIS ONE..  NOT FOR VERY VERY  YOUNG CHILDREN.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|Rick Riordan has made a perfect combo of humor and action. I can't wait to read the next book in this series. And has left me wanting more.

B000P0J09W|5.0|It's been years since I've seen this movie, so I thought I would get it from Netflix. Once I added it to my queue, it moved into the saved section and was there for months. Finally, I just decided to purchase it from Amazon because they had the best price. The DVD arrived within 2 days (thanks to my Prime membership) and was factory sealed.

B007ZGO7EM|3.0|has basic functions of a calculator, but does not rotate with the screen and uses the full screen so if you are pulling numbers from a web site it is a little clumsy
B008Y1YK9Y|4.0|I do have to admit that I was surprised when this latest MIB film came out because I was not at all entertained by the last film (MIB 2). But, when I read that this film contains a concept of \\"time-travel,\\" I became interested yet came to watch it without any expectation.<br /><br />Needlessness to say, I was surprised and found it to be quite good, even better than the second film. And, I do felt that this film can stand on its own without having to watch any of the earlier films. The most surprisingly to me was how Josh Brolin was able to portray the \\"young\\" Agent K so well and so convincing that I actually stood up in my room and applauded him for that.<br /><br />As for the concept of \\"time-travel,\\" it is fair to say that I expected the outcome the way it did. And, I'm not too crazy about the villain. But, overall, it's a fun movie to watch.
078689136X|5.0|Great as a stand alone but even better when you visualize the connection to the Castle television series!  You can &#34;see&#34; the Castle characters and scenes as you read it.
