B000002UC5|3.0|Now I love Macca as much as any die-hard fan, but I've gotta admit, I was disapointed with this album. I was so excited when I got it. But then I found that not only is it very short (only about 35 minutes long), but much of it is instrumental. Of course, Macca is a melodic genius but something just felt missing. Oo You is a great funky little rock song. Not the deepest lyrics, but it still rocks. Every Night is classic, right up there with McCartney's greatest tunes. It's a simple song, but beautiful and romantic. He has a way of expressing what anyone in love feels in a way that most people cannot. And yes, Maybe I'm Amazed is one of the greastest love songs ever, but it just doesn't seem to fit in with this CD. Overall, buy it to complete a McCartney collection. Just don't expect a masterpiece.
0743454537|3.0|Through most of the book I was thinking \\"I like this. Easy reading. Gripping. Can't stop reading. Must get to the end.\\" It's what I'd call an \\"easy read\\" -- the kind of book you read when you are on a beach, or have your feet in the jacuzzi and are sipping your favorite beverage - a drama; even a melodrama. Which is OK sometimes in life. The only thing (before the ending) that bothered me was that the voices of each character were not different. They all had the same vocabulary and used the same phrases. If I were writing from multiple viewpoints, I'd either write in the third person or I'd give them all a different voice.    The near-end climax was fascinating, riveting. But the true end made me toss the book in a pile that I don't intend to circulate among friends. Unfortuntately. And mainly, not just because I didn't LIKE the ending, but because it was so unlikely and seemed to just be planted there, contrived for effect.     The sideline love story ended very simply and abruptly and ended up seeming shmaltzy for that reason.     Until the rushed, contrived endings, I enjoyed the book, and for that reason had to give it 3 stars.
B00005JKG7|5.0|John Carpenter may not particularly view \\"The Fog\\" as one of his better films but, in my humble opinion, this is a title that belongs in every horror fan's collection. I simply cannot find enough good things to say about it. Good casting, great atmosphere, and a dynamically effective musical score all add positively to this film's credit. <br /> <br />It is a ghost story in the classic mold. Hal Holbrook plays Father Malone, a troubled pastor who uncovers a dark secret that could plunge the entire coastal town of Antonio Bay into inescapable doom. The spirits of a dead leper colony that went down with their ship 100 years prior have returned to exact bloody revenge amidst the shroud of an ominous and eerie fog. <br /> <br />I won't reveal anything more that hasn't already been covered within the countless other reviews here. You simply must see this brilliant film for yourself. It stands head and shoulders above most other standard horror pictures of the time, a fact that can be credited mostly to Carpenter's knack for good story-telling. Everything about the DVD is first-rate. It offers both full-screen and wide-screen transfers, as well as two behind-the-scenes documentaries--one of which was created especially for this specific release. <br /> <br />A definite keeper all around.
B000005HLV|5.0|This is a great black metal album.  One of my favorite cds.  The songs are not the best musically, but it has a really cool dark vibe to it, which death/black metal bands often try to mimic now adays unsuccessfully in my opinion.  <br />I enjoy the vocals on this cd, more than i do on any other mayhem release, because they are not as annoying as Maniac's vocals.  The vocals on the song \\"De Myseriis Dom Sathanas\\" are awesome.  When it comes to Mayhem, it doesen't get any better than this cd.   <br />But yeah, if you love real, raw black metal... I suggest you give this one a listen.
B00080ZG1A|5.0|You have to give credit where credits due. \\"The Aviator\\" is a fantastic film.  I think it will be more appreciated by film fanatics, it's not what I would call a \\"popcorn movie\\".  I enjoyed the cinematography more than anything.  I have never seen a film using the shades of colours they used.  It was enough to wake up the senses.  The acting was phenomenal, Leo was fantabulous as were the rest of the cast.  Cate Blanchett soared as Katheren Hepburn, in some scenes emulating Ms. Pac Man with those outrageous red lips flapping away.  \\"The Aviator\\" soared with creativity and good quality film making.  The score, which evokes a deep yet frantic appeal tells the story of a flawed, troubled soul as it unravels into a quary of intense and manic emotions. Martin Scorsese directs another classic film, although overlooked by the Academy (which seems to have cast a blind eye).  R U blind or do u have 20/20 vision, \\"The Aviator\\" paints an abstract portrait of someone who had too much and didn't know what to do with it.
B00003CXCT|1.0|I wonder what George Lucas would say if Michael Curtiz and Howard Koch were still alive and decided, \\"Let's redo the ending and have Bogart and Bergman end up together after all\\"? I think he would be appalled at the thought. That is how I feel at some of the changes made in the re-release of this trilogy. These are films that I grew up with. They are, in certain ways, a part of my culture.  <br /> <br />I don't have a problem with ALL of the changes made in this set. Hayden Christiansen replaces Sebastian Shaw? No problem. It is a natural part of continuity and does not affect the plot given the prequels. The new songs. Whatever! I didn't care for the songs from Jedi to begin with. Enhanced effects and explosions. Awesome! New voices for the stormtroopers and Boba Fett? Hmmm, I'll let that slide. But there are two things that I will neve forgive Lucas for, and they are... <br /> <br />Greedo shooting first - May not seem like a big deal, but it is. It softens the character of Han Solo. When Han took the initiative and shot Greedo under that table, he established himself as a character that could conceivably go either way. He could be a bad guy or a good guy. He could be both. The character of Han Solo would never let ANYONE shoot first. He is a survivor, and he survives by being a rotten scoundrel. John Wayne never shot a guy in the back in one of his films. Clint Eastwood would do it in a heartbeat. Han Solo is Clint, not Duke. <br /> <br />Jaba and Solo meet in the hanger - Another scene that softens both Han and Jaba. Are we supposed to believe that Jaba would let Solo go when he owes him so much money? And if so, why is he so hell-bent on hunting him down only a short time later? What changed his mind all of the sudden? The whole scene is weak and makes Jaba look inept and Han look like a blubbering wuss. <br /> <br />Sorry George, but you destroyed my movie by going just a little bit too far. You can play with effects and do a few continuity shifts, but do NOTmess with my favorite characters because you want it to be more kid-friendly.
B00064MW6K|3.0|\\"Catwoman\\" was not nearly as bad as I thought it to be.  Considering it won the worst film of the year award from various sources, one can only expect \\"the worst\\".  The only thing that saves \\"Catwoman\\" from being a total loss is the \\"camp\\" value and the \\"so bad it's good\\" quality that made many a film famous including \\"Showgirls\\".  Halle Barry has never been an A List actress so you can't really expect much from her, but she does know how to gage her characters to a degree where it's effective but not spectacular.  Sharon Stone enters to add a strange chemistry with Miss Halle and oh NO!, that is when the movie gets really funky and oh so.... CAMPY!! (the word d'jour).  A most meomrable line from the movie that gives this film it's campy kick goes something like \\"It's OVER. No......It's over......TIME!!!!!!!. Yeah, you tell em girrl!  Hey, it's better than Avant garde BS like \\"Elecktra\\".
B0007TKNL0|5.0|I am not going into a long detailed explination of the script, acting, or performances, they are all what the producers wanted, and it all works very well, the film is gorgeous to look at, and the transfer to DVD is the best I have seen so far, it even surpasses the Lord of he Rings trilogy, and that is saying something, the effect is so good it's three dimentional (an almost impossible task when viewed on a 73\\" screen), my one gripe, and it's a big one, is intelligibility. or rather the lack of it, there was a time when film studios and record companies went to great lengths to make sure every word could be understood, in recent years this is a rarity, this film has far to much of the massed voices recorded so that way to much of it can't be understood, considering the quality of todays recording equipment, I find this to be a disapointment, if not downright disgraceful, but at least there is an english subtitle track, which of course most likely means they know it's the only way to be sure that all the dialog is understood, complaints based upon seeing the stage production just don't fly with me, what works on stage rarely if ever work on film, if it did, Producers could save millions and just film the stage production, view stage productions filmed for PBS, of the many I have seen the only two that have been successful at it are The Merry Widow, and Oklahoma
B0000CDLA7|1.0|STREAM IS THE ONLY DECENT SONG HERE- \\"this dying soul\\" or trach 2- whatever it is-- is horrific. Man i miss Dream Theater- do you guys remember??? When they used to play Prog?? Man, that was cool. There is this new band now clled Dream Theater- and they try to play overly fast, heavy, metal. It sucks!!!!!!! Six Degrees scared me- felt the decline- and this album is far worse- hope their new one is decent- but i have bad feeling already!! I FEEL SO USED!!!!  <br />
0062502182|2.0|This book was not as good as I thought after reading the reviews of it. The author justifies chasing unrealistic dreams. Agreed that our hero found the thing at last but it was pure coincidence and not a fruit of his effort. In reality chasing for the meaning of a stupid dream is not going to take anyone anywhere. Justification of strong belief in intuition was the second thing I didn't like. The hero did risk his life in just because he had an intuition that the oasis will be attacked. And worse that the circumstances if the story justifies that whatever he did was correct. This book is full of such non-realistic craps. <br /> This book may be good for time pass but please do not get inspired by this story and start behaving like a crazy person (the hero of the story). <br />
B0000CDLA7|1.0|FOR TRUE DT FANS- THIS IS A NIGHTMARE- PLAIN AND SIMPLE- If we wanted a metal album- we would have boght Metallica- I WANTED DT!!! Stream is the only good PROG song!!!! I know many agree with me!!!!! WHAT HAPPENED DT? i feel used.....excuse me while i go shower (just tried to listen to the horrific \\"dying soul\\"
0312335164|4.0|Digital Fortress is not a bad book, but it lacks the excellency of Dan Brown's later books. The entire book is kept on a very small scale, with the exception of David Becker's portion, which is usually the books downfall. Also, if you have read Dan Brown's other books this book seems fairly predictable and even boring at times because of its lack of the epic feel that has become part of all of Dan Brown's books. The books does manage to keep you guessing on some parts, sadly the bad guy portion is fairly predictable, and the ones it does keep make the book interesting enough to finish. If you have read the Da Vinci Code and are looking for a book that is very good and follows in that books footsteps, read Angels and Demons. Angels and Demons is far better then this book and the Da Vinci Code.
B0007OCG56|1.0|They seem to have a prejudice against Mexican-American actors. <br />Not too many roles for Hispanics out there, but you would figure that at the very least Mexican actors would get parts in stories about Mexicans, right? Nope. \\"Selena\\" the story about a Mexican-American that sings Tejano music...had a Mexican actor right? Nope. Puerto Ricans and Cubans. \\"Spanglish\\" the story of a Mexican woman that comes to America...Mexican playing the part, right? Nope. They went to Seville, Spain to get this one...daytime soap operas, not very many Hispanics there...when there is a part for a Hispanic (once in a blue moon), it goes to Puerto Rican actors...Mexicans on tv? George Lopez and Cheech Marin...name 3 more...I can name 50 African-American actors just off the top of my head...20 Asian actors off the top of my head...10 Puerto Rican actors off the top of my head...4 Mexican actors off the top of my head (George, Cheech, Maria Conchita Alonso, and Fernando Lamas)...Hispanics are the largest Minority Group in America...Mexican-Americans make up 58% of that group...that is right...more than half of the largest Minority Group in America is of Mexican decent...so, when was the last time that you saw Mexicans on tv or in the movies? <br />Dr. Pepper has about a 14% marketshare...How would it be if you could only find one can of Dr. Pepper in every ten stores? Wouldn't you say, \\"Woo, something is seriously wrong here\\"...then they make the story of how Dr. Pepper was created....but...you used Mr. Pibb in all the product shots of the story of Dr. Pepper...about the same thing when you make movies about Mexicans, but use no Mexican actors. <br /> <br />So, who was the movie \\"Spanglish\\" made for? Mexicans? too far from true life for them...Puerto Ricans and Cubans? Can't relate to a movie about \\"Coming to America poor, for a better life\\" (Puerto Ricans were born Americans, Cubans were mostly either rich and/or educated escaping the overthrow of an Autocratic Government)...Spaniards?I don't think that even a handfull escaped poverty by coming to America so they can't relate to the story either...Caucasians? some yes, some no...African Americans? some yes, and some no...Asian Americans? some yes and some no...South Americans? They can relate to the story in it's purest form, but not in this Hollywood/Disneyland version...so, right from the start, this movie had a handful of potential viewers...so, again I ask, Who was this movie made for? <br /> <br />While I am on a tirade: Why is Cajun a language and Spanglish not? Both are a conglomerate of languages, but one is considered delightful while the other is considered an abomination...if you consider the amount of people speaking either, Spanglish is spoken by maybe 1000 times more people than Cajun is.( and believe it or not, Spanglish does have it's own set of gramatical rules...it's not just Spanish and English words thrown together haphazardly...to simplify the rules: Spanish verbs with English Nouns along with a mix of both in adverbs...Spanglish syntax is a beautiful orphan...try and mesh the opposing sytaxs of English and Spanish...Spanglish syntax somehows gets the job done.) <br />
6305696071|5.0|I first seen this movie when I was 15 and 15 yrs later I still love the movie! After reading some of the past reviews, I have to make one comment..It's a MOVIE for cripes sake. A Fantasy, a love story..Leave it at that and nothing more. My 10 yr old loves this movie as well and she has been taught not to take movies literally, that they are make believe, etc..grrrrrrrrrrrr at glamourizing prostitution..what a bunch of hogwash if you ask me.. <br /> <br />so on that note...get it and watch it and expect a awesome love story!!
6303921248|5.0|I have watched this entire movie four times this month.  Every time I watch it I enjoy it as much as the first time.  The experience is very pleasurable.  The sets and scenery are gorgeous.  The music is also very pleasing.  It is a relaxing experience. The characters are very amusing. Mr. Collins tops the list of bumptious fools and his wife Charlotte is the model of saintly restraint. The world is a better place for all the Charlottes in it who manage to live with grace and dignity. Elizabeth Bennett is superbly played by Jennifer Ehle. Colin Firth is a very enigmatic Mr. Darcy. Mr. Bingly is delightful. <br />Mr. Bennett is amusing. It's the best of all worlds where romance triumphs and deserving people are happy. It's a supurb production and also a great gift.
6305922756|5.0|After watching another Christopher Guest related `mockumentary', which Guest directed (\\"Waiting for Guffman\\"), and learning Spinal Tap is actually not a real band, I felt fully prepared to watch this highly acclaimed comedy about the supposed band. <br /> <br />Thankfully I was not let down by Criterion, or all of the raving fans of this film, because the film was hilarious.  From the beginning to the end, this pseudo-band creates an atmosphere that is entirely too funny to be treated seriously, and that is exactly what Reiner intended.   <br /> <br />For example, Spinal Tap is about to perform, but they get lost backstage.  Not all that funny?  Well, first it is not just a little lost, but just watch and see the comments they make while lost.  I mean Spinal Tap is just ridiculous, and this is shown repeatedly. <br /> <br />So all I can say is trust those who say this is great, because although some may be surprised by that deduction, the movie truly is terrific.
0688156819|5.0|I LOVE THIS BOOK! It just says so much about how misunderstood outcasts are, but in Tim Burton's own way. This book is like a cross between Nightmare Before Christmas and Beetlejuice, but maybe that's the way it is supposed to be. A terrific book that reminds you about Timmy's darker movies like Sleepy Hollow.
B000002WE9|4.0|This oft-ignored album, recorded in March 1974 at Memphis's Midsouth Coliseum (formerly the center of controversy when the proposed title, the Elvis Presley Coliseum, was poo-pooed), is easily his strongest live package of the '70s, the one worth having. Elvis is in exceptional vocal form and, between all the stuff that showed up on every other live album of the period, there is a great \\"Trying To Get To You\\" and strong versions of \\"My Baby Left Me\\" and \\"Lawdy, Miss Clawdy,\\" material he otherwise left unnoticed. - by Neal Umphred, AMG
B00005B36H|5.0|This cd has got to be one of the greatest rock albums of all time. Tool is the Led Zeppelin of our time. The songs are so well done. The music has excellent guitar work and some of the best drumming i have heard from any modern band. If you even remotly like rock music this is a must have. The songs are rather long but thats the best part. when you listen to the music you dont want it to end. recommend this CD over almost any modern rock CD.
B0007TKNKG|1.0|Over the top and down to the bottom of the movie list this lousy film belongs.  One of the great bad films of the 80's !
6304698526|4.0|Many people remember this for the ever-famous chase scene, which still is more impressive, and more realistic than most modern chases.  However, there is more to the movie then that, although having no stunt doubles for the chase wasn't a bad start. <br /> <br />First of all though the story: McQueen's character is Lieutenant Bullitt, and he is given what seems like a routine protection job of a high-profile witness; however, the witness is shot, and McQueen decides that maybe this is not such a small issue after all. <br /> <br />The story I felt was pretty good, but really the style is where the most effort was put and achieved.  For example, the camera shots are used to quite good effect.  At the same time though, the \\"realness\\" achieved is also pertinent.  My only problem, and I promise not to spoil, is that the ending is all too reminiscent of the end of Chinatown (no specifics on how). <br /> <br />Overall though, with nice style as I said, a decent plot, and McQueen, the movie is rather enjoyable.
B00082IJ08|5.0|Everything that needs to be said about the sheer greatness of Gorillaz has been said.  Demon Days is surely one of the albums of the year.  <br />However , one little (it's actually huge).... Has anyone been able to rip Demon Days onto their computer? I'm having enormous problems doing so. If anyone has had problems yet was able to rip, can you please advise on this website or....email me at 'cortez-the-raven@hotmail.com'. <br />Cheers <br /> <br />P.S. The album is bananas!!!!!!
B0002858YS|4.0|This album remind's me of those band's of the 80's like new order,The Smith's etc.There are quite a bit of cathy song's here but a bit of the lyric's need a bit more work on them ,but still a very good album.
B0000CDLA7|1.0|This is another pedestrian album from a highly overrated band. Don't get me wrong: these guys have chops to kill, but good chops do not make great progressive rock. The biggest problem I have with this band is that all their songs sound alike - melodically clumsy and harmonically poor. There just is not enough original ideas, although there are occasional interesting instrumental passages. The vocalist just sucks, and overall they sound like a neo-prog band on steroids
B000929AJQ|2.0|I thought Trent was better than this. Almost every track is boring emo garbage with little to no electronic work. I've never really liked his vocal work, but here it just deflates because he has few to no catchy melodies. The good tracks are \\"The Hand That Feeds,\\" \\"Only,\\" \\"Beside You In Time\\" (which is nice and experimental) and \\"Right Where It Belongs.\\" <br /> <br />The Fragile was good for its length and fairly catchy melodies. The Downward Spiral was good for its lyrics, repeating melody, and storyline. Pretty Hate Machine was good for its vast sparseness and minimalism. Get those if you haven't. <br /> <br />Don't be fooled; With Teeth has none of NIN's redeeming qualities or songs which will stick. Trent seems to have sold out just about completely now.
B000002U82|5.0|Excellent album... In order to fully enjoy this album you must ignore track numbers and listen to it in its entirety, or not at all.
B0007GAERG|5.0|I love this album, the songs on here are very beautiful, well written and well produced, and there is not a single filler on this CD. This album was very well received by the general public and the singles are doing extremely well on the charts. The single \\"We Belong Together\\" became Carey's 16th #1 single which puts her 4 singles ahead of Madonna, who is in second place in terms of greatest number of #1 singles amongst female artists. The album opened its first week with sales of just under 404 000 copies, which is the biggest first week sales of her career, and it's currently still in the top 5. At first, I didn't like the debut single \\"It's Like That\\" because it was too hip hop influenced and she was singing things I would expect to hear from Beyonce or Ashanti. But after quite some time, the single grew onto me from frequent radio play and now, I love the song. \\"We Belong Together\\" grew on me instantly because it was a typical Mariah Carey ballad. All in all, this is a fantastic album, like Butterfly, and if you have to get one CD this year, get this one cuz it is off the charts, literally!
B000667FN8|3.0|I got this Album just for the song Untitled and I would say it is worth it just for that song.This kind of music I rearly ever listen too but I really like that one song.
B0000CDLA7|1.0|im through with this crap- whats the point? anyone who likes Dt already had this crappy album- it sucks, and they will never listen to it again- and yes, you'll continue to listen to TOT cause your perception of musci is probably like that of a mole. You dont know good music- you cant defend a band when you know the album sucks--deep down- admit it- TOT sucks! So 1 star- 5 stars- 4 stars- WHO cares- it sucks, we all know it. DOnt bother responding- because i wont read anything else- I go to other sites that have way better reviews- TOT sucks forever!! I can only hope Octavarium is  A LOT better than this bag of trash- written in 3 weeks? that pisses me off!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B00097DX3U|5.0|Yup, I loved the last release and this one continues in that vain. I will admit the debut release took me a bit by surprise as I really didn't know what to expect, but now I'm convinced these guys are indeed a great band.<br /><br />What we have here is good straight ahead rock sung by one of the best male vocalist in the industry today. What Chris Cornell brings to music is soul and boatloads of it. I wish he'd belt it out a little more from time to time ala Soundgarden but hey, the guy's voice impresses the hell out of me. The X Rage lads are a very good rhythm section indeed. I do wish Tom would play solo's that weren't weirded out so much from time to time but again, overall it's tastefully done for the most part.<br /><br />This band rocks and is indeed different from most of the crap that's out there today.<br /><br />Buy it!!
B0001GOH6Q|3.0|This is a good movie but could be a masterpiese if : <br />1. Burton has wanted to exibit a conseptual movie, it was better if he made it more adventurous and entertaining at the end cause that concep is not that strong! first half of the movie was pretty good, but second half was rather awful and dissapointing. <br />2. this movie has one of the most horrible visual effects I've ever seen. when you watch it, you exactly feel that you are watching a demo in a computer game! <br />anyway, I bought it cause I'm a tim burton fan and have all of his movies dvds. The dvd was good, with some special features. But my complain heads to amazon.com, cause I've seen 2 disc collector's edition of this movie with much more special features, but there is no sign of it in amazon.com! probably it was an import version but even if they have not any for sale, listing rare editions of some movies just to inform costumers, will not bother anyone! <br />here are some rare editions of another movies which there is no sign of them in amazon usa : AVP (2 Disc Special Edition), Van Helsing (2 Disc Limited Collector's edition), Spiderman 2 (3 Disc Delux Edition), ...
B000002BQK|5.0|First of all, I must admit I never liked this album, but after continuous exposure to the songs, I fell in love with it. The songs on here are just so pure and beautiful and from the heart and it is hard to believe that there are brainless people on this planet who thinks she can't sing. I mean come on people, she has one of the best voices in this universe and there is no denying that she is a beautiful woman who has enjoyed more success than most artist ever will. A lot of the songs on this album were written or co-written by her which just goes to show she is not only a talented singer but a songwriter as well. This album truly deserves a 5 star and if you like any of Mariah's other albums, then you'll love this one. I strongly recommend this album to everyone and if you are not a Mariah fan, you will be after listening to Butterfly. <br />
B0006SSOHC|5.0|Simply put, Saw is the best horror movie I've seen in years.  I know some people don't seem to like it, but this horror fan is just wallowing in the bloody effectiveness of this extremely dark, intelligent, gory masterpiece of a film.  It's such a thrill to see something certifiably different make its way to movie screens; these days, Hollywood horror filmmakers have gotten so lazy that they can't even make sequels of films - instead, they just remake old horror films that don't need remaking.  Frankly, I'm a little tired of watching teenagers get slashed up in the woods by rednecks and inbred mutants.  I want something new, something fresh, something bold, something ruthless in its execution, something that engages my intellect while assaulting my senses.  Saw fits the bill perfectly.<br /><br />As Saw moves toward its gory denouement, it unleashes a number of great surprises, and the ending is well-nigh perfect - I certainly didn't see it coming.  You may think you know what is going on, but I'll wager that you'll be mistaken.  Best of all, there's no deus ex machina plot device to ruin everything - i.e., as surprising as the final revelations are, everything comes together in a heartbeat to make perfect sense.  I really can't say enough about the script put together by Leigh Wannell and James Wan - it's bloody brilliant.  I love this movie.<br /><br />The Bad Man in Saw is downright sadistic; rather than merely hunt his victims down and kill them himself, he creates elaborate \\"games\\" that lead to painful deaths brought about by the participants themselves.  He chooses his victims carefully, selecting only those who are guilty of some \\"crime\\" or indiscretion that he feels should no longer go unpunished (and when one former victim won the game, he did in fact let her go - and in one twisted sense, she was better off as a result of having played the game).  The particular game at the centerpiece of the film (which is actually rather mundane compared to some of the killer's previous ones) pits two men together in a filthy underground room and challenges one player to kill the other within a certain time limit if he wants to keep his wife and daughter alive.  That would be Dr. Lawrence Gordon (Cary Elwes); his partner in torturous suffering is a young fellow named Adam (Leigh Wannell).  Both of them wake up in this room without knowing where they are or how they got there.  Our imaginative dark lord of sadism provides the two with some hidden clues and \\"tools\\" that do much to keep things really interesting.  Did I mention both men are chained to pipes on opposite sides of the room, and that there's a bloody dead guy lying in the middle of the floor?  Oh, how I wish I could tell you more about what happens, but I wouldn't dare deprive any Saw virgins out there from truly enjoying this magnificent film.<br /><br />I must admit that I expected to see nothing but gore in this movie - mindless, bloody gore.  Certainly, there's gore all over the place, but this is the exact opposite of a mindless thriller.  Yet again, a small-budget film has far surpassed the best horror films Hollywood has to offer, proving once more that a strong and intelligent plot, not gore in and of itself, is the secret for succeeding in this darkest of genres.

B0000AZJXQ|5.0|With the rise of nu-metal in the late 1990's, and simpler song structures beginning to take over (at least in the mainsteam), an album like A Perfect Circle's sophmore effort \\"Thirteenth Step\\" was desperately needed. The craft that the band practiced on their debut \\"Mer de Noms\\" has been perfected on this album. Flowing, rich, textures, haunting and beautiful vocals, and the exact right combination of heavier, rock parts and melodic and beautiful movements. This collection of 12 songs may constitute the most rewarding and meaningfull rock album in the 21st century thus far this side of \\"Lateralus\\". <br /> <br />\\"Tribal\\" movements and sounds are utilized to brilliant perfection, especially on the 8 minute epic opener, \\"The Package\\", as well as the sombre dirge of \\"The Noose\\". Like \\"Lateralus\\", the instruments all come together to form a beautiful audio soundscape to reward the listener's ears with an emotional outpour by Maynard James Keenan, without a doubt in my mind, the most accomplished vocalist in mainstream music today. In the vein of a vocalist like Mike Patton, Keenan's voice is an instrument, with the expressive (if a tad self-indulgent) lyrics adding the foam to the warm wave of sound.  <br /> <br />\\"Thirteenth Step\\" boasts production of the highest order, and a quality sound system is greatly suggested in order to experience all of the hidden nooks deep within the album. This album is much more of a wave, like I said, but if I had to select individual songs, these would be the best: <br /> <br />\\"The Package\\" - the epic opener takes the listener on a trek (literally), while remaining fresh and original throughout. <br /> <br />\\"Weak and Powerless\\" - the first single has some incredible lyrics, and also a hauting bass line, and is a definite anomaly, as is a bona fide rocker, but with the APC \\"twist\\". <br /> <br />\\"The Noose\\" - one word: melody. <br /> <br />\\"The Outsider\\" - Maynard with a brief falsetto, a heavy as hell passage from out of nowhere, and one of the best guitar performances on the album. <br /> <br />\\"Pet\\" - my personal favourite. Experience the final 30 seconds and you'll surely see what I mean. <br /> <br />Don't let this gem pass you by, Maynard and Co. certainly deliver with this masterpiece. 5 stars.
B00070Q7VO|5.0|Before i bought this album, I'd only heard a few songs, mostly from Michael's first album. I bought \\"It's Time\\" solely for the track \\"Home\\" (which is totally worth it!). I was very impressed with this whole album. It's very eclectic. Michael Buble's vocals are amazing and soothing all at the same time. His covers are creative and polished. <br /> <br />If you're looking for some great music, do yourself a favor and pick up anything by Michael Buble! You'll thank me for it!
0451199871|5.0|\\"Oh, ma'am, oh, ma'am, there's a body in the library!\\" <br /> Mary, the usually calm maid, is unfortunate enough to find the body of a dead girl in the middle of the Bantry's library. Nobody recognizes the murdered girl. She doesn't belong in the sleepy town of  St. Mary Mead. Miss Jane Marple, the inquisitive investigator, whose forte is the ability to draw connections in human nature between suspects and villagers in St. Mary Mead, is brought into the case by her friend Dolly Bantry. The local police are also hot on the trail of the suspects. The body is identified as that of Ruby Keene, a young dancer at the Majestic Hotel. The list of suspects include: Basil Blake, an obnoxious young man; Mark Gaskell and Adelaide Jefferson, whose inheritance would be in jeopardy if Ruby Keene was adopted by Conway Jefferson, their father-in-law; Josephine Turner, Ruby's distant cousin; George Bartlett, a guest at the Majestic where Ruby worked; and Raymond Starr, a dancer at the Majestic.  <br /> Agatha Christie, the author of this book, takes us on an exciting adventure to unravel the mystery of Ruby Keene's murder. In her usual fashion, Agatha Christie keeps us in suspense until the very end. I've read several of Agatha Christie's murder mysteries, and I was not disappointed with this book. I would highly recommend this book to anyone who enjoys murder mysteries. <br />        Miss Marple and Hercule Poirot are two of Agatha Christie's unforgettable characters. Miss Marple stories revolve in and around St. Mary Mead, a quaint little English town.  Poirot on the other hand, travels all over Europe to solve mysteries.
B0002OERI0|5.0|So you don't like Green Day's political views? They're not asking you to.  So you don't like the \\"mature\\" sound of American Idiot? Play your Dookie CD repeatedly. <br /> <br />True Green Day fans understand that their political views are just that - THEIR political views.  While I personally, find that Green Day lyrics are poignant, honest and thought-provoking, it's the combination of those intelligent lyrics with their punk attitude music that has kept me a Green Day fan since 1992.   <br /> <br />American Idiot is another example of brilliance misunderstood, in many ways.  In order to appreciate that brilliance you have to embrace both the music and the lyrics.  There is nothing about Green Day's lyrics for \\"American Idiot,\\" \\"Jesus of Suburbia,\\" and \\"Holiday\\" that should come as a surprise.  Given the state of the world at this time, I heartily agree with Green Day's take on world events.  Do we, as Americans, feel so superior to everyone else that we can't realize our own faults as a country?  Please get over it and listen to this CD with an open mind. <br /> <br />And there's nothing wrong with me <br />This is how I'm supposed to be <br />In a land of make believe <br />That don't believe in me <br /> <br />All I can say is Green Day - keep rockin and keep testifying because this Green Day fan is loyal!
B0000AQS0F|5.0|First of all i'm not one to write reviews but i feel compelled to do so on account of the quality of this particular show.  <br /> <br />I only caught the last half of one episode when the show actually aired and i thought it seemed very cool but had no idea what it was. Later my fiancee kept bugging me to buy it saying it was one of the best shows ever. I gave in, partially because i was a fan of Buffy and Angel. Honestly though i didn't know how well his writing would hold up in a sci fi series. <br /> <br />The beginning of the first episode seemed decent, a small bit of very cheesy dialogue had me a bit worried but by the end of the pilot i was hooked and as i watched more and more episodes it just kept getting better. There honestly was not even one episode that i didn't enjoy. So why did i enjoy it? <br /> <br />It isn't quite like other sci fi space shows. There are no aliens, not everyone has access to incredible technology, not every ship looks all pristine and new and they don't generally rely on a talking computer to solve their problems.  <br /> <br />In my opinion it is more realistic than most sci fi shows. For one thing there is no sound in space. People have left earth that was and terraformed worlds in another solar system more abundant in habitable planets and resources. Also the Alliance(controlling government) has control of most of the more advanced technology and the further away from the central core planets they control the more people have to make do with whatever they can scrape together. See not everyone wanted to live under alliance rule and so a civil war started. The Alliance eventually won the war against the Independants so those that still weren't willing to live under the Alliance went on to populate the outer planets. In my opinion this is a more realistic view of the future than many sci fi space shows present. So that's the backstory more or less but what is the show about? <br /> <br />The show follows the crew of Serenity. A small transport ship. The captain was one of the Independants in the war. He got the ship and put together a crew so he could keep out of reach of the Alliance and maintain some freedom. They take whatever jobs they can find (mostly less than legal) to keep their ship flying and stay out of the Alliance's reach. The show is very well written and the characters are very believable and easy to relate to. Every character has depth to them. I really can't stress enough how well written this show is. I very highly suggest you at least rent the first disc and check it out even if you don't normally like sci fi as it is very different from most sci fi shows. <br /> <br />For those that aren't aware, in September this show is coming to theaters in movie form. I was fortunate enough to have gotten a ticket to an advanced screening. I absolutely love the movie but i will not comment on it further as this is about the series and not the movie and also it's a bit too soon after i've seen it. I prefer to wait untill the initial excitement of seeing it has died down before i say anything. <br /> <br />
B00003CXCT|1.0|The edits made to these films show even more that Lucas was a puppet of Kershner, Brackett, Kasdan, Henson and Richard Marquand. His changes have ruined these films. The only way to get good copies of these films is to somehow acquire the laserdiscs from the 1990's. The laserdiscs have had most cleanups done, but without the disgusting add-ins and edits which not only ruin the feel of the movies, make them clunky and obese from a story perspective, not unlike the shaved chin-fat on Lucas' repulsive and greedy face. Do not purchase these DVDs, they are a disgrace in the eyes of the hammer of Nazareth. I want a release of the original films on DVD, that's not hard is it? Just a version without badly re-done music. I don't want \\"surround sound.\\" This package is all gimmicks and promotion, and filth.    Thanks for reading, hope this was helpful.
B0000CDLA7|1.0|hes a moron- he doesent know anything
B000002GQL|5.0|this is the Moodies seventh release, their fifth 5-star effort in a row! Every tune is SO Moodies. The weakest song is, ironically, the first. Don't get me wrong, I love the words to 'Lost in a Lost World' and cannot rebut a single point that Mr. Pinder makes. But why put it first? It's an awkward sounding tune with great words that would have finished the album nicely. In fact, the last song on the album would have made a great opening cut (I'm Just a Singer in a R-N-R Band). Other than that, no complaints. Hayward's tunes are two of his very best (and most underrated): New Horizons and Land of Make-Believe. You cannot go wrong with any of the Moodies studio releases, especially between 1967(Days) and 1983(Present).
B00004W221|5.0|A friend gave this movie to me to watch.  I loved it!  I went through every emotion, and by the end my sister and I were cheering aloud.  I recommend this movie to anyone of any age.  It has a great story line, and the moral of the story is worth it.  Five stars isn't nearly enough.
1577314808|5.0|For a subject that is very difficult to put to words, and where words don't apply. This was put into words that guided me to the right place. I had many addiction problems and pain in my life. This book showed me in a gentle way, how I was causing all my pain...why I had so many questions about life...and why I, and everyone around me was so depressed. I had, and was the disease.  <br /> <br />It is possible that others have read books that had words that guided them better. However, Tolle makes it a point to tell you not to get too mixed up in the words he is using to discribe the techings. Quite simply, you know you undestand what he is talking about when you read it. You cannot deny it. It was like someone was writing a book about me.  <br /> <br />Bottom line. If you have any pain in your life, emotional problems, or addiction....READ THIS BOOK. Ohhhh my. It can completely change your life overnight. It did for me. Since reading the first 30 pages or so, I have not been the same. What's more, I have never been better. I have been with Amazon for many years, and this is the first review that I am compelled to write. Flat out, the book....SAVED MY LIFE. I am free from addiction. I was a hardcore pill popper and a user of alcohol and drugs since I was around 18, and on May 19th, 2005...I read the first 50 pages of this book, and it brought all the thing I was doing into the light of conciousness, and I am never going back. I have been at peace in my life and know what it means now to live in the moment. To not seek refuge or long for the past, or place more value in the future than the present moment. I help others around me see this same light, I mean it...I have completely STUNNED those around me by being what I am now.  <br /> <br />I attribute all of that to the text within this book. It was worded in what I believe was the best way possible to make me, a person who tended to find rubbish in virtually EVERYTHING, come to my conciousness and say, \\"I am never leaving again!\\" Thank you Eckhart Tolle!
B0000CDLA7|1.0|read the reviews of this album on progarchives.com- this 5 star reviwer is either drunk, or this is the only DT album he owns- do not listen to him- or her
B000002GQK|5.0|\\"we're part of a fire that is burning, from the ashes we will build another day.... \\" follow the procession as the Moodies document the evolution of sound, communication and then - MUSIC! A journey in time from the dawn of the age of man up through the Vietnam war era. Justin makes some very good points about life, death and war in the aforequoted song 'The Story In Your Eyes'. 'One More Time To Live' is another standout tune on this disc, although not initially. Interestingly though, after many repeated listenings, I really like this tune. It doesn't stand alone as well as some because it is partially based on 'Procession' and other themes found in EGBDF. John definitely shines on this song. Everyone in the band contributes in some significant ways - that's what we love about the core 7 after all, isn't it? Justin, John, Mike, Graeme and Ray. Each a vital part of the sound AND the lyrical themes. <br />A must have for Moody Blues heads.
B0000CDLA7|1.0|I'd like to review the whole concept of this band. I chose to put my review here, because this record is the most horrible example of their muzak. <br /> <br />Yes I can hear that you guys are great players and I know you have gratuaded from a music school. I think that won't explain why you still lack imagination (\\"omg, we have a problem. We need to add twenty-one minutes to this song. I can't come up with anything... hey Petrucci, why don't you masturbate with your guitar for ten minutes and the others will show their enormous technical skills for ten minutes, and then we have the chorus again?\\") and dynamics? Why have you to drop out the last 1/8 of every bar to make the 4/4 riff go in 7/8, so it would be progressive? Maybe the emotion-lacking and uninnovative noise is not the issue - but the lack of DYNAMICS. Listen to Camel's Echoes. Now that is the best song ever made. The best thing is that there are quiet parts which are really quiet and louder parts which are really louder. It keeps the tension and attention going on and doesn't just bore your ears and make the music sound like a pot of porridge. It seems you think that dynamics in music is just about using a clean sound with some chorus when you want to play a softer part and then switch it to a really huge and compressed distortion when you want to rock.  <br /> <br />And how have you never heard of nuances? When you repeat this extremely hard 11/8 riff, which is just a 12/8 riff Mike Portnoy came up with while taking the [&*!#] and finally you decided to drop this last eight off because it would otherwise sound like pop music and too commercial, yes, you repeat it let's say, like, ten times, every time with the same [%*!#]ing way and same [%*!#]ing volume, so it would be reaaally boring. Oh, I forgot, it's metal music! Well, metal with its all original rawness and loudness is suitable for shorter songs, 3-4 minutes - longer ones need some kind of quieter passages and stuff borrowed from other styles or the listener would just be exhausted. LISTENING TO DREAM THEATER OR OVERLONG METAL MUSIC IN GENERAL IS JUST LIKE READING A VERY LONG TEXT IN ONLY CAPITAL LETTERS AND WITHOUT ANY PUNCTUATIONS YOUR BRAIN DOESN'T REALLY GET THE IDEA WHAT IS GOING ON AND YOU CAN'T FOLLOW THE TEXT INTENSELY FOR A LONG TIME WELL THIS IS NOT JUST WITH THIS KIND OF MUSIC IT IS A TREND WHEN MASTERING A CD TO OVERCOMPRESS THE MUSIC TOO [%*!#]ING LOUD SO IT CAN BE AS LOUD AS OR LOUDER THAN THE OTHER SONGS COMING FROM THE RADIO SO PEOPLE WOULD REMEMBER THEIR SONGS BETTER BUT WITH DREAM THEATER I THINK THIS IS NOT NECESSARILY THE CASE, THEY COULD CHOOSE A DIFFERENT WAY
B00009N83Y|3.0|In a time of Prohibition, rival gangsters and speakeasies, Clint Eastwood stars as police Lieutenant Speer who gets tangled up with former partner Mike Murphy (Burt Reynolds) who quit the force to begin his own private detective agency together with his partner Dehl Swift (Richard Roundtree). A lot of humor is well represented in this film as well as some good action as Speer and Murphy reluctantly work together to solve the case involving two rival gangsters Primo Pitt (Rip Torn) and Leon Coll (Tony Lo Bianco) and their accomplices. <br /> <br />Some of the songs contained in the movie were co-written by Irene Cara who stars as Swift's girlfriend and entertainer Ginny Lee who also sings a George and Ira Gershwin melody. Though not quite her best role, the late Madeline Kahn played the daughter of a wealthy businessman and girlfriend of Murphy who was Pitt's kidnap victim, holding her until he got the goods. Probably the best parts of the film were the gunfight scenes where Murphy gets tangled up between two of Pitt's soldiers and two of Coll's soldiers spraying bullets everywhere under the watchful eye of Speer as Murphy takes cover, and in Pitt's hideout inside a garage shows Murphy pulling out a long gun when Speer gets the better end by drawing out an even longer gun as they exchange gunfire with Pitt and his soldiers with a little mechanic running back and forth in panic seeking cover and dodging bullets. <br /> <br />Not really the best movie, but it's worth a look. <br />
B0000CDLA7|1.0|It pains me to give a album with the name Dream Theater on the cover, a one star rank <br /> <br />sorry, but its the truth, and i too didnt tough this day would come... but anyways <br /> <br />i gotta say this album starts PRETTY well with As I Am, a nice heavy track and somewhat of a nice rythm, and also another of Petrucci's MONSTROUS solos <br /> <br />BUT IT DIED THERE <br /> <br />Next we have the continuation for the GODLY 6 degrees track, The Glass Prison, by the name of This Dying Soul. Even Heavier than As I Am, it would actually be nice to put this on an album, but emotionally speaking, it doesnt changes nothing from the last track and it just keeps it heavy with no high points and the same happens with the next TWO tracks!!!! <br /> <br />Endles Sacrifice and Honor Thy Father just keeps you with that heavy fast and ignorant music. Completely unnecesary. And then it changes to Vacant, the WORST Dream Theater ballad EVER!!!! (I really couldn't found a bad ballad in DT till now) and the main line changes into Stream Of Conciousness, an really nice instrumental if they hadnt made that one mistake - They got it running for WAYYYYY too long, if they cutted a lot of things out of it and made it a 5,6 minute track it would be a lot more exciting, it kind of loses meaning on the middle of it <br /> <br />And to the closure - In The Name Of God <br /> <br />the same mistake of Stream Of Conciousness, too long. <br /> <br />A complete meaningless \\"samba\\" part with John Petrucci getting faster than ever. If it Werent for that, this track would be a nice heavy and epic closure <br /> <br />Not worth the money spent, sorry new guys <br /> <br />Dream Theater started thinking that speed DOES matter and that what aint heavy aint good, all of this turned into this boring and fast CD. Perfect with you're beggining to get into Heavy Metal and wants to see how fast and heavy a human can go... but well aint that Iron Maiden eh? Just 30 years newer <br /> <br />If you wantheavy music well done, and not necessarily fast -> LaBrie's new work <br /> <br />If you want a nice Prog Metal CD ----> Petrucci's new work <br /> <br />Im waiting for the next album now, and for the first time with Dream Theater, im gonna download to sse if its WORTH buying
6305897786|3.0|The ninth gate could have been a classic thriller, if only it didn't give us cause to laugh hysterically through the whole thing.<br /><br />First of all the acting. To call that acting is to say that Roman Polanski can actually make a good film. Its not possible, frankly, the acting was horrendious. Its been said that you cannot have a terrible Johnny Depp flick, and I whole-heartedly agree. But you can have a very meodiocre one. Even Johnny Depp seemed lost with his lines, as all the actors fumbled through the story, trying desperatly to fulfill their characters actions, and failing dreadful.<br /><br />And don't get me started on the ending. There's nothing too it, we know that Johnny has found the ninth gate, but whats behind it? Where does it go? Only he knows because all the audience is allowed to see is light shining from the doorway, and his figure heading into it. Also, we gather that his guardien angel could or could not be lucifer incarnate. Even the pictures from The book of nine gates isn't very clear on this.<br /><br />Scenes that could have been scary become rather mundane as the film wears on, and actions seem ludacris as women fly, and men punch each other out without seeming to hit each other. Good for movies from the fifty's, but something from nowaday just doesn't cut it.<br /><br />Johnny Depp is interesting to watch however, as the suave indifferent Indiana-Jones type, who is not only sexy but scholery to boot. His complete indifference to what goes on is what makes him unique for everyone else seems to full of melodrama to be of any real help to the script. Such as the Madam Telfar (Lena Olin) who seems to whole-heartedly delight in scratching and clawing every available guy that comes around. Enough was enough when she tried it on Johnny after sleeping with the guy. But second helpings get old.<br /><br />On the whole I thought this could have made a decent thriller, but fell short, however it is good as a rather light-hearted romp of (evil?) proportions. Just don't get your expectations too high.vil?) proportions. Just don't get your expectations too high.
B0008ISM40|5.0|I enjoyed With Teeth very much. I have been a fan for many years. And I think this CD is just as good as all the other Nine Inch Nails records.  All of the 13 songs are different in a way.  All of the NIN music has changed over the years and that is a reason that I like their work. <br />Trent is still a bright Artist. Some of the amazing songs in this album are All The Love In The World, Only, Sunspots, The Line Begins To Blur, Beside You In Time, and Right Where It Belongs. <br /> <br />If you buy this album you should try and get the 5.1 DUALDISC, it sound really amazing! <br />I think this album is a step forward in Nine Inch Nails music making. <br />The drumming is really well done for the records as well. <br />This new NIN won't disappoint at all.  <br />

B000002HAJ|4.0|The album \\"Wish\\" was an important moment in the history of The Cure.  First and foremost, it followed the  magnificent \\"Disintegration,\\" the pinnacle of the band's achievement.  After waiting three years, fans didn't know what to expect.  Of course, the album wasn't as good as \\"Disintegration,\\" but that could hardly have been expected, and \\"Wish\\" turned out to be a strong effort.  Second, \\"Wish\\" marked the departure of the band's next most important member to Robert Smith up until that point -- Lol Tolhurst.  I have read that it was a painful divorce, which must have effected Robert Smith in some way.  Third, \\"Wish\\" is easily the most commercial of the band's albums, which isn't necessarily a bad thing.  I've always thought that some of The Cure's most \\"commercial\\" songs were among their best (i.e. \\"Lovesong\\" \\"Just Like Heaven\\" \\"Pictures of You\\").    In fact, \\"Wish\\" contains several hit-oriented songs, the most obvious being \\"Friday I'm in Love\\" which, despite the criticism, still elicits a big response when performed in concert, and is still a pleasure to hear on the radio -- it's irresistible.  Even better is \\"Doing the Unstuck,\\" an infectious song in which Smith repeats the phrase \\"Let's get happy\\" (albeit sarcastically).    Although some of the album's songs kind of drag, I also particularly like \\"Open\\" \\"Cut\\" \\"Trust\\" and \\"To Wish Impossible Things.\\"  However, by far, the best track is \\"From the Edge of the Deep Green Sea\\" which is easily one of my favorite Cure songs.  The hypnotic guitar riff, swirling sound, and driving beat, are extremely compelling.  This is a song that must be listened to on good headphones with eyes closed at a healthy volume.  I'm often unclear as to the meaning of Smith's lyrics, but I think this song is about a man who is in a long-term relationship with a wonderful woman who he knows loves him deeply.  Unfortunately, he simply is unable to feel the same way, even though he constantly struggles to reciprocate.  The conflict and anguishin Robert Smith's voice reveal itself loud and clear.    Footnote:  In my opinion, \\"From the Edge of the Deep Green Sea\\" was the last of The Cure's truly great songs.  Therefore, I will repeat my list (which I gave in my review of \\"Boys Don't Cry\\") of all the Cure songs that I believe rise to this description.  They are, in chronological order:    1.  Jumping Someone Else's Train  2   Killing an Arab  3.  A Forest  4.  Primary  5.  All Cats Are Grey  6.  The Hanging Garden  7.  A Night Like This  8.  Just Like Heaven  9.  Pictures of You  10.  Lovesong  11. Fascination Street  12. From the Edge of the Deep Green Sea    There are may other Cure songs that I consider \\"near-great\\" as well.

B0002EXH4A|1.0|I have only heard the Amazon clips of this remix and I just couldn't take it. I probably would have enjoyed it if the original mix was more or less like this one, but some parts have been replaced by completely different styled ones. For example, the solo on one of my favourite tracks \\"Into The Lungs Of Hell\\" has a new note in it which just make me cringe every time I hear it. The inclusion of the Paul Lani Mixes is just unfair. They were unfinished so obviously it's not going to sound as good as the remix. <br />The idea was that the original album sounded too rough and that it was going to get the production it really deserved. Personally I listen to so many badly recorded bands, that I am used to this. I'd recomend this version only to people who are not accustomed to cheap recordings, but for those who do not mind a filthy sound go for the original.
B00080ZG1A|3.0|Let me state a few facts about myself and, in doing so, set up a very sincere question about \\"The Aviator.\\"     1) I'm a huge fan of Howard Hughes, an absolute buff on the guy.  I've read two biographies of him and have to say he's one of the most interesting historical figures of the past century: His brilliance, his wealth, his flaws, his successes, his peculiarities and the periods in which he lived all combine to create a fascinating figure.    2) I'm a tremendous fan of Martin Scorsese.  He's made some of my favorite movies and I think he's probably one of the top five greatest directors working today.  There's just something about the way he photographs images and people that makes even his worst movies worthwhile.    3) I also think Leonardo DiCaprio is a really good actor, a fact that has been publicly obscurred (but not hampered) by the \\"Titanic\\" hype and by some poor choices (or lack of choices, in recent years).      4) And I think \\"The Aviator\\" was probably the best produced movie of 2004.  The cast is excellent, the sets and costumes and designs are fabulous, the cinematography is exquisite.      So, THAT SAID, why didn't I like the movie more?  It's an impressive achievement but I seem to appreciate the parts more than the whole.  And as good as DiCaprio is, I think he may have been miscast.  Only a star of his level could've gotten this kind of budget, but he simply doesn't look right in the part.  It's not until after he grows a moustache that he really start to resemble Hughes.  Most of the time, Hughes looked like a guy who was quietly trying very hard not to leap out of his skin but DiCaprio seems more intent on burrowing deeply *into* his body.  He just doesn't have the same kind of intrinsic uncomfortability.    Still, it's an impossible movie not to recommend.  There are long stretches of space but every so often, there's a brilliant explosion.

I realize some people probably found it disgusting but they were probably watching the wrong movie.  <br /> <br />And maybe I'm just jaded but I actually didn't think it was as raunchy as it's rep proclaimed.  There's actually kind of a sweet undercurrent to the whole thing, despite the fact that it's basically making fun of the left, right and everyone in between. <br /> <br />Another highlight: Kim Jong Il's musical number.  In fact, all the songs were dead-on parodies.  You really have to pay attention to pop country anthems to nail them the way Parker and Stone did. <br /> <br />The extra features on the disc are pretty good, too.  I never thought watching puppeteers could be so interesting.
B0000CDLA7|1.0|this album is horrific- just like the 5 star reviwer's mother
076790592X|5.0|Left a very deep impression on me. I had read both books by mitch albom but I prefer this book better than the `5 people you met in heaven`. This book teaches about life greatest lesson and everything. After reading this book, I truly felt enlightened. It makes me think that life is just about a ride. We will all die one day so itsn`t neccessary take everything into account of how much we have gained and how much we have lost. Like what a quote from Mr Morrie... `What`s wrong with being No.2`? Its definitely a book for everybody...
B0000CDLA7|1.0|For me this album represents a big decline in the quality of writing from Dream Theater. The songs although chock full of heavy riffs, unisons and time sig shifts seem to lack any direction and to my ears end up sounding like a collection of riffs. The lack of distinct clear melodic hooks is also very disapointing...I've always enjoyed Dream Theater above other prog/metal bands because of their ability to fuse interesting harmonic ideas, blistering technicality with soaring melodies but here, the melodic aspects are sadly missing.  <br /> <br />Technically the playing is immaculate as always, John Petrucci (Guitars) really goes for the throat on this disc (personally I prefer his more melodic playing). Everything is tight and accurate and the production is great - the bass is more audible than previous releases. If you like your prog on the heavier side of the spectrum theres lots to interest you here, otherwise you may be well advised to check out some of the bands earlier releases - \\"Images and Words\\" or \\"Six Degrees of Inner Turbulance\\".
B000002UAF|4.0|A Hard Day's night, of course with the huge movie hit, was essentially the album that presented The Beatles as a predominant pop/rock band, and showed that as a group could write their own material as well as covering songs by other artists.<br /><br />Strong held up against albums from their early era, A Hard Day's Night is much more oriented on catchy pop tunes rather than, psychadelic masterpieces and similarly deep, dark compositions that came later in their career, most notably with Sgt. Peppers. The album kicks off perfectly, with a mystery chord, and then launched into the self titled track, a very catchy, innovative one indeed. I found essentially where this album lacked brilliance was in consistency, as after hearing the titled track, I sensed the album lost some of the energetic edge of the song, and A Hard Day's Night to me is the heaviest song on the album. Nevertheless, it's wonderful music, which in essence is the most important thing about The Beatles.<br />So, as we continue along the album, we get a very nice tune from I'm Happy To Dance With You. Easily the strong point of this album comes about around the transition stage from Side A to Side B, with tracks 5 to 8 being the best section on the album in my opinion. And I Love Her features lush, sentual lyrics, with a beautiful guitar strum. An excellent love song, and to follow that up, they go back to the upbeat, catchy tunes with Tell Me Why, with its quicker paced delivery and sing-a-long lyrics. Can't Buy Me Love is an immediate hit, with the classic lyrical delivery to jump start it, and its great poppy catchiness. Anytime At All is the same in a sense, and is my favourite song off the album. The lyrical delivery makes it an instant favourite, as well as the quick guitar runs. I'll Cry Instead is another highlight, falling into the bunch quite nicely, but lacks in length, standing as the shortest track on the album. In fact this album as a whole is especially short, clocking in at only  30:55, which is shorter than a typical Beatles album. Things We Said Today has a strong guitar strum, however lacks in the excitement of a catchy lyrical delivery. When I Get Home fixes that flaw, another catchy, heavier tune, with smooth lyrics. The album slows the pace back down with You Can't Do That, and finishes off on a relatively strong note, with one of the most enjoyable guitar strums on the album coming from the beginning of I'll Be Back.<br /><br />To conclude the review, A Hard Day's Night cannot be considered an excellent choice for a top notch Beatles album to buy, however it is a superb effort for a band who hadn't quite yet reached their prime in songwriting abilities and instrumentation, however still produced a great album. 31 minutes worthwhile, I suggest checking out the follow up to this one Help!, as I find they take their talents one step further with that album. Of course late era albums are essential such as Sgt. Peppers, Rubber Soul, Revolver, Abbey Road, White Album(not for me though) and Magical Mystery Tour. Recommended to diehards, Beatles fans looking for early era Beatles music, and also maybe a good choice for 60s rock fans.orter than a typical Beatles album.

B00097DX3U|5.0|I have always been a huge Rage and big Soundgarden fan.  So of course I was stoked when the first Audioslave album finally came out after years of rumors.  While I always loved Rage, I thought that after Battle of Los Angeles, De La Rocha's vocal style was really starting to handicap the band and had run its course. I can only hear \\"Free Mumia\\" so many times. I'm a stalwart rock fan, and Cornell finally took Wilk, Commerford, and Morello from being an incredibly good hip-hop backing track to a legit, arse-kicking rock outfit.  I don't know how anyone can complain about this merger as it has produced one of very few big-time rock acts here in the 00's.  The first album kicked but this takes it to another level.  You get virtuosity, depth, and incredible excitement on every track.  Morello solos on every single track, most of them extended jams.  It is absolutely sick and a wonder to hear.  I find it bizarre that people complain Audioslave went soft with this album.  Apparently they only saw the Be Yourself(a great song in its own right) video and decided, \\"oh crap\\".  They obviously never heard \\"Man or Animal\\", \\"The Worm\\", or \\"Your Time has Come\\".  Cornell really brings it this time and you have to think that he is responsible for much of the added depth to all the tracks here.  \\"Be Yourself\\", \\"Doesn't Remind Me\\", and \\"#1 Zero\\" all manage to have Cornell's trademark soul and still hit hard. The end result is invigorating, uplifting, sometimes just plain exciting.  Every track is a winner, this is what rock albums are about.  People seem to have forgotten how to rock since the time when grunge was 'pop' music.  Audioslave knows how to rock you to your foundations.  What else really matters?
B000002J29|2.0|Genesis has to be one of the all time best bands in the progressive rock and progressive pop genre. That being said, this album is not the best example of their art. While it does capture the band's post-Gabriel live sound, the tunes are now nearly thirty years old and the sound is a bit tired and dated. Recorded in 1977, this was close to the period in which Phil Collins took over for Peter Gabriel as the band's front man. My impression is that Collins always took a rather cynical view of Gabriel's material, and this seems to come out in the way Collins half-heartedly sings the early Genesis pieces on this album. Another example is his handling of \\"Cinema Show\\". Collins and his side drummer reduce this wonderful early masterpiece to a hyperactive drum-fest, in which all of the original character and delicacy of the song is obliterated in favor of Collin's ego with the sticks. I would pass on this lack-luster work and opt instead for the studio albums, whch are excellent.
B0007Z4S4C|5.0|Stuck in the past? Don't bother. This is an album by Robert Plant and the Strange Sensation. There are 6 talented musicians involved and it is a good thing. I bought my first Zep album in 1970, but I have since tossed the lavalite and damned if I can find my mood ring.<br /><br />This album is absolutely brilliant. Great work guys, thank you for it. I'll see you 7/15. You'll know me , I'll be the fat middle aged guy with graying hair wearing the Stewie 'you suck' t-shirt. Hmmm, upon further consideration good luck picking me out.
B000063K2W|5.0|I was so glad to see that The Women is now available on DVD.  This is a classic film with an all-star cast that included many innovations for its time.  The review by Jeffsdate shows that this person knows nothing of this history and should do some research.  Yes the characters were horrible to each other!  They were meant to be!  Have you read the play?  All the characters are stereotypes.  Hence no males in the cast - including animals.  And the fashion show was so long because this was one of the first technicolor scenes. I hope that other Amazon customers will give this movie the chance it deserves.
B000002I2M|5.0|And it works. Very well. This is the ultimate finisher of the legacy that the Doors left us. Love Her Madly, Riders on the Storm, the title track, and WASP are all essential cuts to any Doors collection. This is probably my favorite album out of them all, save Strange Days and their self-titled debut. Wow. This album's damn good.
B00005JNRB|4.0|While Matthew M's pearly smile and Penelope C's exotic features may have been the draw for a large portion of the viewers, those ended up being bonus' beside the entertaining plot and delicious dialogue. This movie doesn't mess around with heavy drama or annoying romance. The romance was the part I was most worried about and I was happily suprised to find that they didn't hate each other, that the female didn't have to dominate the male, and that they didn't have to try to hide their emotions or make a lip-lock in every scene(in fact there's only one). Steve Z ws perfect - great lines and facial expressions. Sure, alot is improbable, but in this movie its not so tedious. I highly recomend this movie - and hey! Even if you hate it, at least you got to see Matthew's gorgeous smile!
B000002GQE|5.0|I had the Mobile Fidelity version of this on LP....and it sounded great....this remastered cd lives up to that album and more.<br /><br />The original LP and CD sounded thin and weak in output...and the band tracks sounded like they were recorded in somebodys garage using cheap microphones.<br /><br />NOT THE CASE HERE......The remasters have more air and life than anything previously available.....a fullness that makes them a real pleaseure to experience again.
B000003TA4|1.0|Kurdt & co. had just as much input in the mixing and slick-ass production as Andy Wallace and Butch Vig. But Mr. King-O'-the-Grunge Kobain still went ahead and badmouthed said producers/mixers for supposedly making Nevermind too listener-friendly. Kirrt Cawbaiyneeeie lambasted the poor guys for doing what he and his band requested, and vowed to never work with them again. Like always, Kobayne got his way, soon whined like a two-year-old once Nevermind didn't get indie recognition. Instead, it got undeserved worldwide recognition, and brought him more money than he ever deserved. Luckily, he was able to feed his drug habit with that money, and ended up with a shotgun facelift from his own doing. <br /> <br />Egomaniacal Rock Stars. Gotta love 'em. <br />
B000002GQL|5.0|I guess if you decide to take a 5 year vacation....it's best to do so after making a phenomenal musical statement.<br /><br />This is the ultimate Moodies album...it would have been their \\"Abbey Road\\"..had they decided to retire.<br /><br />The remastering was done superbly...nothing out of original balance..all songs are as they were recorded....a much cleaner sound and more output than the original cd's.
B0000AFQS0|5.0|At last, at last, at last!  It is wonderful beyond words for a Who fan to have this film restored to its original length.  All the little interview snippets that Jeff Stein had interwoven between the big segments acted as filmic grace notes, so it's great to have them back.  Also welcome is the restoration of the complete mini-opera from the Stone's R&R Circus.<br /><br />The DVD is both less and more than the original film was.  The hi-def rendering makes the old b/w footage seem even grainier than it did on the theatrical release's celluloid.  (The Producer's Cut, as someone on an interview track calls it!)  Plus, since no one seems to have kept a whole negative, the film had to be reassembled from parts again, many of which had deteriorated over the years.<br /><br />But all that is like the wrinkles in a piece of leather: the flaws give it character.  There's the film itself, Jeff Stein's impressionistic montage of The Who.  Given that there's little footage of their early 70s peak, and no Quadruphenia material at all, it's still impressive how amazingly great the band is onscreen.<br /><br />Okay, no need to plug the film; any given Who fan will have most of it committed to memory anyway.  But if you're new to the DVD, there's plenty of goodies here.  On one feature, Jeff Stein and an interviewer voiceover the whole film, reminiscing and commenting as each segment unreels.  The producer tells the tangled tale of how the film was re-produced for the DVD.  And joy of joys, there are the bonus footage tracks.  These are not additional music clips, but are the Shepperton sequences, with the individual camera angles broken out separately.  So, if you are a big Entwistle fan, you can select the Oxcam and enjoy his formidable prestidigitation on \\"Baba O'Riley\\" and Won't Get Fooled Again\\" uninterrupted from start to finish.  Indeed, Entwistle gets spotlighted in a couple of isolated audio tracks from Shepperton.  It too is wonderful, showing him flailing his Alembic bass.  His sound is like a boxer working over a speed bag, as he lays down a cacophany of 32nd notes, and then hauls off for a killer bottom string note.  It's of much more than just historical interest.<br /><br />The Who's place in rock history is secure, thanks in no small part to this lovingly restored landmark film.  If a rockumentary can ever become an heirloom, then this is the one.  And, with so many second-hand copies in circulation, although you may not be able to \\"afford\\" Keith Moon, you can certainly afford this!a boxer working over a speed bag, as he lays down a cacophany of 32nd notes, and then hauls off for a killer bottom string note.

0440224764|1.0|It was a real task to get through this but Grisham has a record of turning out good stories so I thought this would eventually turn into a good story. I was wrong. If you choose to read this be aware that you can read the first 50 pages and the last 50 pages and get 98% of the story without wasting your time on the 350 pages in the middle which drag on endlessly. And there's absolutely no reason to read the last 5 pages of the book for any reason.<br /><br />While it's pretty clear that Grisham phoned this one in it was still on its way to a possible 2 star performance (maybe even a 3 with a great ending) simply because it's a mildly interesting story and because so many other thriller writers can't write at all. But with the last five pages Grisham turned this into a zero stars book.<br /><br />There are so many problems with this book that it's hard to now where to start, but let's start with characterization. At no point did I feel I knew the main character and at no point did I care what happened to the main character (or anyone else). Grisham tells us what the characters are doing and lets us in on a few idle thoughts but we never really know these charcters. The bad guys are bad but that's about all we know about them.<br /><br />The legal complexities of the story are a little bit interesting if you're an attorney. If you're not I doubt that anyone would really care. But everything is predictable until the last two surprises.<br /><br />WARNING SPOILERS AHEAD SPOILERS AHEAD<br /><br />QUIT READING NOW IF YOU CARE<br /><br />WARNING SPOILERS AHEAD STOP NOW<br /><br />The first surprise (as to who ratted on Patrick) is both irrational and illogical. If Patrick wanted to stop the chase he could have hired an army of lawyers and worked out a deal with the Feds BEFORE turning himself in. There was no need for drama at all. Same with a possible state prosecution.<br /><br />The second surprise (she disappears) simply has no place in this story. I don't care that Patrick loses her and I don't care what happens to her, but her disappearance simply doesn't fit into the story. It doesn't fit what we know about any chracters in the story nor does it fit into any of the story lines.<br /><br />My guess is that Grisham never really knew how to end this. He also probably read through it and realized what a bland predictable read it is and decided to do something existential. Unfortunately this isn't an existential story. So the ending is just BS.at Patrick loses her and I don't care what happens to her, but her disappearance simply doesn't fit into the story.

B000003TAW|5.0|I can't say I love any album more than this.  From the moment I heard that amazing fingerpicking intro to My Name Is Jonas to the last bass note in Only In Dreams, I was enthralled.  I literally got goosebumps, it was so great. <br /> <br />The Blue Album is written with a different spin than any bands of the time.  It's emotional, yet fun and cheerful at the same time.  From the real life twist of Say it Ain't So to the cheerful atmosphere of Holiday and the nostalgic song Only In Dreams, Blue is solid all the way through.  It's thought by many fans, including myself, that it will never be surpassed by Weezer or another band.  Pinkerton, their next album, came close, but in a different way.   <br /> <br />There's no reason why not to buy the Blue Album.  Weezer earned a name from this CD that sold less than a hundred in the first week, yet came back to sell millions.  Listen to the Blue Album, and find out why.
B0009QTS1M|5.0|After a 35 year hiatius, from the Sword and Sandal Genre,Ridley Scott, dared to bring it back and with an almost unknown actor. New Zeland born, Australian raised actor, Russell Crowe. <br /> <br />What a terrific chance and choice he made. A star was born, and the movie Gladiator, was one of the most magnificent movies of the summer of 2000. Russell and Ridley made such an impact on the world. Russell won Best Actor, and Gladiato won Best Picture. it made such an impression on Hollywood and the World, that every Director decided to try their luck, to no avail. <br /> <br />TROY, ALEXANDER etc. Even Ridley's KINGDOM OF HEAVEN could not meet GLADIATOR standard. Like Chris Rock the comedianne said, the lead actor was not Russell Crowe. <br />I have played my copies of Gladiator so much i had to replace it 3 times.  <br />I am so looking forward to my new (3) disc version, and especially for Russell's comments.

0316548189|5.0|I recently visited South Africa and saw LONG ROAD TO FREEDOM in the book stores. I decided that due to its length I'd buy it when I got home or get it from the library. However, as I was leaving the country I had a couple of hundred rand, so I decided to spend it on this book.  Frankly, it was one of those books that you buy and I figured that I would never get through it. However, on the 12 hour flight from Cape Town to London I became enthralled with Mandela and his life.<br /><br />The book is well worth the read and moves along very quickly.  Having visited Robin Island and experienced South Africa, reading the book was extremely meaningful.  The feelings of reconcilation that are prevelant at least with the people I spoke with have their roots in Mandela's philosophy.<br /><br />I always thought that Mandela was a great man, but reading this book put his stock up a lot higher.<br /><br />He is truly a national treasure of the world.

B0007Y08IS|2.0|That says it all right there, if you are unfamiliar with the now infamous landmark of the Comedy Central channel on cable, 'Southpark' are basically poorly drawn children characters that curse and make bodily function jokes at each other all day. The aim of it's creators is to basically smash every barrier of good taste and offend every group in society that they can, but where do you go from there? Team America functions along the same lines. The puppets in here are amazingly filmed, and I would recommend you see the way they look on screen. However, only see this film if you are a liberal and have a healthy sense of humor. There are a lot of infantile jokes, gross out humor and some very, very offensive material, often in poor taste. There's plenty of harsh language and this film is definitely not for children. I don't offend easily, but I even turned away during the puppet making love scene, in which they mimic all sexual positions and then go too far I feel, in showing the puppets deficate and urinate on each other. The premise of the film is obviously poking fun at Bush and the war on terror and a thinly veiled way of saying that we often poke our nose in other countries affairs. No one is left unoffended in this film. I would mainly say that if you like that Southpark<br /><br />type of humor, this is your film. If that type of humor offends you, stay far away from this film.
B00080ZG10|4.0|This is an audacious, surprisingly amusing piece of Hollywood filmmaking by a veteran craftsman of the first magnitude, yet for a number of reasons, not necessarily of Martin Scorsese's sole doing, the movie does not resonate as much as you wish it would. In staying true to the spirit of multimillionaire magnate Howard Hughes between the late 1920's and the late 40's, Scorsese and screenwriter John Logan are stuck with the facts as they happened, and consequently, the film feels episodic with a great, sometimes dazzling story in the first 2/3 of its epic 166-minute running time and a pedantic, only occasionally involving last hour.<br /><br />You need to have some familiarity with Hughes' life to understand his halcyon years proving himself as a Hollywood tycoon worthy of respect, and his legendary excess during the three-year production of the now-forgotten \\"Hell's Angels\\" is captured perfectly here with truly thrilling aviation sequences. Scorsese then focuses on Hughes' romance with Katharine Hepburn and captures the oddball chemistry of burgeoning eccentrics amid the frenzied environment of studio-owned Hollywood, in particular, the Cocoanut Grove nightclub. These sequences remind me a lot of Scorsese's failed musical, \\"New York, New York\\", but this time he seems far more assured. Ava Gardner enters the picture in the forties, as Hughes builds luxury airplanes that can't fly and his obsessions and paranoia start to take over. There's a magnificently filmed sequence of Hughes crashing his XF-11 plane in the middle of Beverly Hills.<br /><br />Once he recovers from this incident, the film starts to drag, as the story shifts focus to the power struggles in positioning Hughes' airline TWA against the European-route monopoly of Pan Am and the machinations of Pan Am CEO Juan Trippe and the corrupt Maine senator Owen Brewster who investigates Hughes' WWII government contracts. Even the legendary mini-flight of the Spruce Goose fails to excite this late in the story. Only Scorsese's famous \\"Taxi Driver\\"-like, mind-bending touch brings off the surrealism of the sequences where Hughes locks himself up in his room. The film ends rather anticlimactically with Hughes' successful 1947 appearance before Brewster's committee before he drowns in his obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD).<br /><br />Leonardo DiCaprio's chief asset as an actor is his intensity of purpose, and as Hughes, he has plenty of opportunities to display this attribute with his character's obsessions with aviation, moviemaking, glamorous movie stars and ultimately germs. What he is missing is a level of gravitas that would have made his character's increasing eccentricities more bearable to watch. Even though the reed-thin Texas-tinged voice is accurate, there is something perpetually juvenile about DiCaprio's appearance regardless of the twenty-year span of the story. This unfortunately compromises the chemistry between him and the obviously more mature Cate Blanchett, who initially seems to be crossing the border into parody as Hepburn. She displays the familiar brusque manner without caution and even affects the recognizable voice but with an inaccurate throatiness that belies the legendary actress' high, fluttery pitch at the time. Nevertheless, she eventually finds her grounding, especially as she recognizes their too-similar personalities and softens during the Hepburn family gathering scene.<br /><br />With less to do, the too-patrician Kate Beckinsale is in over her head as Ava Gardner, unable to convey the real actress' palpable sultriness or predatory voraciousness without posturing. On the other hand, Alec Baldwin is becoming a stronger character actor with every new film, and he plays Trippe with disquieting authority. John C. Reilly plays assistant Noah Dietrich in his typically hangdog fashion as he subsists more in the shadows. Alan Alda plays Brewster with Hawkeye's familiar mannerisms unafraid to show the underlying sliminess of his character. All the externals are impressive - Thelma Schoonmaker's sharp editing (the pacing never drags...just the story), Robert Richardson's cinematography, Dante Ferretti's production design, Sandy Powell's costumes. Yet for all of this, the movie falls short as a masterwork in Scorsese's filmography. This is a film to respect and not to love.<br /><br />The first disc has an excellent commentary track by Scorsese, Schoonover and producer Michael Mann - all full of insights without being pedantic. The number of extras on the second disc of the two-DVD set is staggering, really too much for anyone except for those deeply interested in Hughes. There is one deleted scene and twelve separate featurettes and documentaries covering everything from the production to Hughes' role in aviation to OCD to the music. Beyond the sheer number, my complaint about the set is that it's hard to maneuver around the decidedly viewer-unfriendly menus.Schoonmaker's sharp editing (the pacing never drags...just the story), Robert Richardson's cinematography, Dante Ferretti's production design, Sandy Powell's costumes.

038533348X|3.0|If you're not a devoted fan of Vonnegut who picks up everything he's read including his short stories, then this is not the one I would suggest.  Cat's Cradle is the book that made the world notice Vonnegut, and compared to numerous other authors it's still a great yarn.  Compared to his own works, I feel it's not his best. <br /> <br />There is still much to be lauded: his engaging prose style, a plethora of imaginative tangents such as a fascinating and hilarious religion.  The reason I'd say a book like Slaughterhouse Five is far better is that all the pieces of Cat's Cradle do not fit together perfectly.  The book is almost schitzophrenic with hundreds of fascinating tangents, but when one tries to put it together, it's frustrating. <br /> <br />I guess that's not the point.  The book itself frequently speaks on the meaningless of life, so maybe Vonnegut intentionally made certain of the books tangents lead nowhere.  Still, as a reader, one cannot help but wish for a greater cohesiveness.  The ending of the book left me highly underwhelmed. <br /> <br />Still, this is a very loved book, and for good reason.  If I hadn't read eleven other books by Vonnegut I'd be singing it's praises.  So, to summarise, I think some of the books he wrote later on in his career are far stronger, but this book is still a worthy read and the first in which hints of Vonnegut's genius are visible. <br />
B0000CDLA7|1.0|It pains me to give a album with the name Dream Theater on the cover, a one star rank <br /> <br />sorry, but its the truth, and i too didnt tough this day would come... but anyways <br /> <br />i gotta say this album starts PRETTY well with As I Am, a nice heavy track and somewhat of a nice rythm, and also another of Petrucci's MONSTROUS solos <br /> <br />BUT IT DIED THERE <br /> <br />Next we have the continuation for the GODLY 6 degrees track, The Glass Prison, by the name of This Dying Soul. Even Heavier than As I Am, it would actually be nice to put this on an album, but emotionally speaking, it doesnt changes nothing from the last track and it just keeps it heavy with no high points and the same happens with the next TWO tracks!!!! <br /> <br />Endles Sacrifice and Honor Thy Father just keeps you with that heavy fast and ignorant music. Completely unnecesary. And then it changes to Vacant, the WORST Dream Theater ballad EVER!!!! (I really couldn't found a bad ballad in DT till now) and the main line changes into Stream Of Conciousness, an really nice instrumental if they hadnt made that one mistake - They got it running for WAYYYYY too long, if they cutted a lot of things out of it and made it a 5,6 minute track it would be a lot more exciting, it kind of loses meaning on the middle of it <br /> <br />And to the closure - In The Name Of God <br /> <br />the same mistake of Stream Of Conciousness, too long. <br /> <br />A complete meaningless \\"samba\\" part with John Petrucci getting faster than ever. If it Werent for that, this track would be a nice heavy and epic closure <br /> <br />Not worth the money spent, sorry new guys <br /> <br />Dream Theater started thinking that speed DOES matter and that what aint heavy aint good, all of this turned into this boring and fast CD. Perfect with you're beggining to get into Heavy Metal and wants to see how fast and heavy a human can go... but well aint that Iron Maiden eh? Just 30 years newer <br /> <br />If you wantheavy music well done, and not necessarily fast -> LaBrie's new work <br /> <br />If you want a nice Prog Metal CD ----> Petrucci's new work <br /> <br />Im waiting for the next album now, and for the first time with Dream Theater, im gonna download to sse if its WORTH buying
0375703861|2.0|I was greatly disappointed by this book. While the initial premise is promising and the first third of the book is excellent [hence the two stars], Smith throws it all away through consistently poor dialogue, increasingly unconvincing characters and a blatantly `manufactured' storyline. I ended up skim reading the last two thirds of 'White Teeth' and don't think that I got my money's worth.     Aside from the poor storyline and dismal dialogue, one of the aspects of this book that really stuck in my throat was the poor quality of much of Smith's background research. As an example, throughout the book one of the characters is obsessed with the role his ancestor played in sparking the Indian Mutiny. However, despite the sequence of events being repeatedly referred to, Smith gets some basic facts wrong, including miss-naming the British officers involved. An even more basic mistake is that at one point it is stated that Jamaica is so small that you can walk around it in a day(!). Seeing as Smith was a student at Oxford University at the time she wrote 'White Teeth' such basic mistakes are inexcusable and are an indication that she embarked on her first novel well before she should have.
B0007M22TI|5.0|My aunt sent me a copy of this DVD as a congrats for getting out of school. I was a bit wary of it, at first, I thought \\"it's going to be something corny, isn't it.\\" But it wasn't. Since my father's side of the family is richly saturated in everything Ireland (he's 100% Irish) I was awfully moved by all of the traditional songs they did, specifically the ones in Gaelic. The fiddle pieces were fantastic, since I play violin/fiddle I got extreamly excited to see a fiddler showcased.  <br />This DVD is worth the buy, whether it's for you or for a family member who enjoys all things Celtic, the show is energizing and it's really nice to actually see the people singing, instead of just hearing it.
B000002B30|5.0|Bruce Springsteen is one of the hardest artists to anthologize, since his music went through so many changes over the years. He started out as a Dylan - esque folk singer, then reemerged as a pop superstar, and finally a soft rock staple (thanks to the hit \\"Streets Of Philadelphia\\" from the move \\"Philadelphia\\"). \\"Bruce Springsteen - Greatest Hits\\" is an 18 track collection of his career up to 1995, and tries to give a brief overview of each stage of his career. It succeeds to a point, since it does leave a lot out, and makes a good starting point for beggining Springsteen fans.<br /><br />Unfortunately, his early years (1975-80) are represented by only three tracks. \\"Born To Run\\" is an obvious opening track, and it still remains one of the greatest rock songs ever written. I can honestly admit that I never really enjoyed \\"Thunder Road\\" but I do think \\"Badlands\\" is an excellent song. However, I was extremely disappointed that thye did not include my favorite song from this era, \\"Rosalita\\". This omission is almost unforgivable and I almost deducted an entire star for this omission.<br /><br />His pop years get the most representation. This is probably my favorite Springsteen era, since it includes all of my favorites: \\"Hungry Heart\\", \\"Dancing In The Dark\\" (the song with the video with Courtney Cox) and \\"Glory Days\\" rank as my all time favorite Springsteen songs. I also really like \\"Brilliant Disguise\\". There are some other big hits that should be here (namely the top ten hits from \\"Born In U.S.A.\\" left off as well as \\"Tunnel Of Love\\"), but I'll get to those later.<br /><br />His later years are covered well. \\"Streets Of Philadelphia\\" is a great song, and I like \\"Human Touch\\" as well. The three new songs with the E Street Band, however, I didn't really get into, with the exception of \\"Secret Garden\\", which became a top twenty hit two years after this album came out.<br /><br />As I said, this collection is far from perfect. There are many hits left off, including \\"Rosalita\\", \\"Tenth Avenue Freeze-Out\\", \\"Fade Away\\", \\"Cover Me\\", \\"I'm In Fire\\", \\"I'm Goin' Down\\", \\"War\\", \\"Tunnel Of Love\\", and \\"One Step Up\\". Here's my idea for \\"The Best Of Bruce Springsteen\\":<br /><br />1.Born To Run<br />2.Rosalita (Come Out Tonight)<br />3.Badlands<br />4.The River<br />5.Hungry Heart<br />6.Atlantic City<br />7.Fade Away<br />8.Dancing In The Dark<br />9.Cover Me<br />10.Born In The U.S.A.<br />11.I'm On Fire<br />12.Glory Days<br />13.I'm Goin' Down<br />14.My Hometwon<br />15.War<br />16.Brilliant Disguise<br />17.Tunnel Of Love<br />18.One Step Up<br />19.Human Touch<br />20.Better Days<br />21.Streets Of Philadelphia<br />22.Secret Garden<br /><br />I do understand that some of these tracks will have to be edited to fit onto one cd, but that's fine with me, since it will be the definitve Springsteen collection. Until then, however, this collection will do just fine., \\"Fade Away\\", \\"Cover Me\\", \\"I'm In Fire\\", \\"I'm Goin' Down\\", \\"War\\", \\"Tunnel Of Love\\", and \\"One Step Up\\".

B0000CDLA7|1.0|I think this is maybe the worst album from DT. I'm completely amazed how unique their playing is and how much their songs vary in the previous albums. DT is unlike many bands... for example if you've heard one metallica album, you've heard them all, but every DT album is different.  <br /> <br />Again, they've made an album that's definantely different, but unfortunately it's no good. It's not that i don't like heavy stuff, it's just that i don't like DT:s heavy stuff. The reason heavy doesn't fit DT is James LaBrie. His voice is no good. I get cold shivers when he tries to scream high notes especially in the live performances... on the other hand his voice is nearly perfect in vacant and other albums like six degrees. On ToT his singing melodies are almost nothing compared to what they've been in many other albums. But why in the world does he rap in this album?  <br /> <br />Another dissapointment is Petrucci. How can, in my oppinion, the best guitarist in the world make this kind of s*it? How can his guitarplaying be so mindless shredding... no musicality at all. Every song on the album execpt vacant has a solo. Nothing wrong with that if the solos were good and would vary but they're all as fast as petrucci can play with no musical content at all. I just hate seeing such a good player doing this kind of music. Before his playing has been something that i've never experienced before. No guitarist in the world has made such great music that i never get bored listening to it. His live performances in the mid 90:s are incredible. For example Steve Vai is a good guitarist, but he's a bad musician. Most of his music is boring and unoriginal... it's meaning is only to show how technically proficient he is... I think petruccis playing has gone to the same point in ToT... his solos have no idea... or atleast if there were an idea you couldn't here it because it's played so fast its. Playing fast should be a tool to accomplish expressing a feeling for example or something. Fast parts should balance the slow parts to make the music more alive. Speed shouln't be the purpose itself like on ToT it is. <br /> <br />The album has it's good moments too. Vacant balances the albums heavy songs, and does a great job at it. Stream of Conciousness i think is the best song off of the album...the most musical and it has a good feeling to it in the name of god is also great but maybe a bit too long. As for the first 4 songs... they are awful. As i am,The dying soul and honor thy father sound almost like any angry teen music... they have their good parts also but it doesn't help much. Endless sacrifice has atleast some effort. After hearing other DT albums, it isn't just enough that the songs are ok, they have to have something that makes me listen to them over and over again. The 4 first songs definantly aren't those kinds of songs.  <br /> <br />I think everyone of you who read these appreciate good music... otherwise you wouldn't listen to dream theater. Because of this i have to suggest you all listen to a german band called Superior. I think it's the best that heavy metal as a genre can offer. The singer is amazing and their music is just incredible compared to train of thought. And if many of you consider Train of Thought good... well you should really listen to it. <br /> <br />Please e-mail me if you something you would like to say or maybe try to convert me into liking the album :)
B000000W5N|5.0|Still riding high on the critical and commercial success \\"Let It Bleed\\", The Rolling Stones managed to outdo themselves when they released \\"Sticky Fingers\\". It included arguably their strongest, most consistant album ever, with songs ranging from classic rock to country to blues.<br /><br />\\"Sticky Fingers\\" kicks off in high gear with my all time favorite Stones song, \\"Brown Sugar\\". This is just one of those songs that you love so much that you really can't describe how you feel about it, but this is definitely one of the greatest rock songs ever written.<br /><br />The next song is the bluesy ballad \\"Sway\\". This song is notable mostly for including Mick on rhythm guitar, and overall this is one of the album's most memorable songs. The next song is quite simply the best Stones ballad ever. \\"Wild Horses\\" is one of the best songs they ever recorded, and it holds its own against \\"Brown Sugar\\" and \\"Satisfaction\\" as one of the best Stones songs ever.<br /><br />Next up is one of the greatest jams ever put on record. \\"Can't You Hear Me Knocking\\" is a Santana inspired song that features two of the greatest guitar players ever, Mick Taylor and Keith Richards, dueling it out in a four minute solo that was recorded by accident. However, it's Bill Wyman and Charlie Watts that outshine everyone else on this song thanks to their ability to play almost as their own separate unit, creating a spellbinding effect.<br /><br />\\"You Gotta Move\\" is a stupid song, easily the worst of the album. If you want to hear a good version of this song, check out the version on 1977's \\"Love You Live\\". The next track is pure Stones: \\"Bitch\\". Featuring an energetic Mick backed by blazing guitars and roaring horsn, this one of the best and most underrated songs in the band's entire catalogue, and it should have been released as its owns single rather than be relegated to the b-side of \\"Brown Sugar\\".<br /><br />\\"I Got The Blues\\" is a bit of a downer. It is a little too depressing for my taste and even for the Stones, this track really isn't memorable. The next song, however, is a real masterpiece. \\"Sister Morphine\\" is a chilling account of a drug addict's final hours before the addiction that his dominated his life will kill. The result is utterly spellbinding, and Ry Cooder is excellent on slide guitar. This sis such a great song. I'm at a loss for words.<br /><br />\\"Dead Flowers\\" is a tongue in cheek country number that remains one of the band's best and radio regular. I love the sound of the guitars of the guitars on this number. The closing track, \\"Moonlight Mile\\", is an excellent acoustic number that perfectly sums up the band's attitude at this point, looking at every album as just another mile on bumpy road to success.<br /><br />This is a highly recommendable album, and one of the best rock albums ever made. Definitely worth owning.and even for the Stones, this track really isn't memorable.

B000001GY9|5.0|Leonard Bernstein may be well-known for being a great interpreter of Mahler, Haydn, Mozart, Copland, and Shostakovich, but this album truly shows he's good at Schumann too. The tempi are most of the time fast as most other conductors despite his age and deteriorating condition.<br /><br />  I bought this album as a counterforce to Karajan's 2 CD set on all of Brahms' symphonies. After all, Bernstein and Karajan are two of the best-known condutors of all time, each with different specialities.<br /><br />  Karajan's performance on Brahms was moving because of his profound spirit of conducting. The 4th was a real drama under his baton.<br /><br />  What I love about this album was that Leonard Bernstein and the Vienna Philharmonic Orchestra transformed the early Romantic-era composer's music into a raw, riveting experience, and Bernstein loved rousing high emotions to the audience, whether it's effective or not (such as the over-exxagerated Tchaikovsky 6th he did on DG).<br /><br />  The Second Symphony turns out to be one of my favorite early Romantic symphonies thanks to Lenny's moving performance. The yearning, the triumph, it was all there.
B0006399FS|1.0|U2 fall into the same bag as REM--fairly strong, influential early careers that've should've ended with their fourth or fifth album; but instead continued into the horrible realms of big-label sellout \\"adult-contemporary\\" filth (which on U2's side, started with the hugely overrated Joshua Tree). At least REM don't have to suffer a politically grandstanding, sunglasses-sporting douche of a frontman (granted, Michael Stipe isn't much of a prize these days either).<br /><br />The moment I saw Bono striking about a dozen stupid \\"rock star\\" poses in that gaudy IPod commercial while Vertigo blared in the foreground, I knew this album was traveling to a whole 'nother realm of suck. Speaking of the leadoff single, all it proves is that U2, an Irish band, should never attempt Spanish (\\"1, 2, 3, 14?!\\" Idiot). And the rest of the album is equally terrible. Another dose of overly earnest \\"Peace & Love\\" crap, pop-Christianity, and general irrelevancy. The music is dull and boring, merely a Joshua Tree redux but with even less edge if that's possible.<br /><br />U2's public persona has become so overbearing these days that I sold my copies of Boy, October and War. The band's last 15-20 years of middling output has made me realize how much of a joke they really are (the same goes for Bruce Springsteen, to a lesser degree). I refuse to support Bono's stadium-size ego any longer.
B0002KQNL8|4.0|I had seen all the ROTLD movies when they came out years ago, so i bought the first and the 3rd on dvd, which made no since why they didnt have the second one out. I was so glad when I bought my copy and imagine my surprise when I start to watch the film and notice that all througought the movie the soundtrack is different than the way it was for the theaters. That mad me angry enough, then as I was switching over to the commentary I find out that the original soundtrack is in the dubbed french audio but not english....Go Figure!!!!!!  The movie is still great and cheezy though
B000002LEE|4.0|Despite all my divergences into extreme metal, industrial, progressive rock, jazz, and even hip-hop, I am still primarily a born-and-raised devotee of punk, indie, and \\"alternative.\\" Albums like Nothing's Shocking are the reason why.<br /><br />Jane's Addiction seamlessly combined funk, metal, and psychedelia to create something truly outside the '80s norm. They could charge into driving Zeppelin-esque riffs, play infectious funk grooves, or mellow out and bring some subtle vibes. They also had a bizarre, arty aesthetic personified by eccentric frontman Perry Farrell, some controversial cover art (the cover of followup Ritual De Lo Habitual was actually censored in some markets), and perverse, weird lyrics.<br /><br />Ted Just Admit It, for example, is a track targeting the trial of serial killer Ted Bundy and the horrific images of murder and rape therein, and features a chorus of \\"Sex is violent.\\" Heavy. They weren't without a quirky sense of humor though, as the goofy lounge departure Thank You Boys demonstrates.<br /><br />Farrell's distinctive siren wail is definitely an acquired taste, but when I'm in the right mood few vocalists sound better. The crashing thunder of tracks like Ocean Size and Mountain Song fit him to a tee. Dave Navarro's guitarwork is novel and unique, and the Eric Avery/Stephen Perkins rhythm section is funky and assured. Summertime Rolls is a dreamy, beautiful trip down memory lane. The horn-driven, profane Idiots Rule tears, and closer Pigs In Zen combines Farrell's lyrical musings with powerful, stattaco riffs. Runaway hit Jane Says is the tale of a junky trying to clean up and move to Spain (\\"I'm gonna kick tomorrow\\") backed by tropical-flavored steel drum.<br /><br />Nothing's Shocking is Jane's Addiction's finest in my opinion, though Ritual De Lo Habitual is no pushover and has its share of awesome songs (Stop, Classic Girl). The current, post-Porno For Pyros Jane's Addiction that released Strays is little more than a cynical cash-in, but the strength and influence of the original band's efforts, along with The Pixies, Sonic Youth, Red Hot Chili Peppers, Faith No More, and others help put the oft-disputed genre of alternative on the map. Essential.ical cash-in, but the strength and influence of the original band's efforts, along with The Pixies, Sonic Youth, Red Hot Chili Peppers, Faith No More, and others help put the oft-disputed genre of alternative on the map.

B000002UC5|4.0|As a raging Paul McCartney fan, I've made an interesting observation: talk to your average Macca faultfinder and almost without exception one of the \\"arguments\\" they bring up is \\"He hasn't done anything good since the original McCartney.\\" It's been so since the days of the album's release, and it's a statement I can't imagine anybody saying who's actually heard anything past this eponymous 1970 solo debut.    Recorded on the very eve of the Beatles' destruction, McCartney finds Paul bereft of his bandmates or really any mates at all, running totally under his own steam. He performs each and every instrument, from bass and piano to guitar to drums to wine glasses and bow-&-arrow sound effects, and committed the whole thing to a simple four-track machine at his farm in Scotland. The lack of support is obvious - the album consists primarily of simple, almost amateurish performances of unfinished song-fragments with ramshackle lyrics or no lyrics at all, being half-baked instrumentals. If McCartney is viewed on the basis of material, it scrapes up an \\"average\\" rating at best.    However, there's more to it than that. At the time Paul was dealing with a new marriage, going into a new decade as his band and his old life disintegrated before his eyes - he hardly had the energy to get out of bed, let alone write and record another Sgt. Pepper. And if much of McCartney is unfinished, much of it is also very touching. Every Night, for instance, is a poignant snapshot of Paul's mental state then; Junk has one of his loveliest melodies; and Man We Was Lonely is a deceptively simple \\"thank you\\" to Linda for her aid in his turmoil, among others. And then of course there's Maybe I'm Amazed, far and away the record's highlight - perhaps THE finest love song ever written, totally out of place in its passion and professionalism.    There is a certain homey charm to McCartney, but that charm can be found on albums like Ram and Wild Life too; it is very honest musically, but that samehonesty is evident on even much more recent affairs such as Flaming Pie; it may be the most historically important record Paul has ever made. And good, bad, or indifferent, it IS a classic album and probably belongs in your collection if only for its significance.
B00097DX3U|4.0|Although Audioslave still isn't as good as Rage or Soundgarden, this album is still pretty strong.  This one isn't as heavy as the first but there is some killer tunes on it like \\"Your time has Come\\" and \\"Out of Exile\\".  Morrello's guitar work is better in this one than the first and the band seems to run a lot smoother than on their first album.  I reccomend this CD to Soundgarden fans rather than Rage fans. <br /> <br />Score: 8/10
B00082IJ08|5.0|From a distant perspective I never knew who the Gorillaz really were: a cartoon trip-hop band or a cartoon experimental funk band? Nevertheless I didn't pay much attention to them since I wasn't exploring different areas of music then as I am now. It forced me to deduce that the band was pretty clever and unique to sell themselves as cartoon characters, but wouldn't be able to make up for their charisma with good musical riddance.    I accidentally came across \\"Demon Days\\" a couple of days ago, so I didn't formulate any expectations since all I had heard from them was \\"Clint Eastwood\\" back in 2001. Let's just say that I was in for a very pleasant surprise and haven't been happier listening to a CD in some time.     There's virtually no filler tracks present with the exception of a so-so intro, but from then on in it's a non-stop barrage of everything you've ever dreamed of and has a goodie for everyone who comes across its path. Although \\"Feel Good Inc.\\" is destined for heavy rotation on the radio (If you're mired in the sounds of War's \\"Lowrider\\" and want a suitable replacement for when you're cruising the streets, then this song will make you turn that bass all the way up), I can't get over how good \\"Dirty Harry\\" is. It's a song that shifts gears with a catchy children-driven melody, violin samples, and an explosion of toe-tapping rap. It manages to give you a whiff of the 70's and then shoves the 90's down your throat in the \\"old-skool\\" bridge. It's mind-blowing.    If you're new to Gorillaz or skeptical of the mish-mash genre, then I assure you it is worth your dime and a whole lot more.
B0007TKH66|5.0|I really didn't know what to expect when I bought this series. I saw a few shows on TV (in Australia) but they didn't grab me. I just finished watch all the series 1 DVDs... Brilliant. Enjoyed every episode. I think TV has had its day with adverts it does not interest me at all. But these WideScreen 5.1 DVD episodes were fantastic. At first I was worried that it was not futuristic enough, but then they introduced the temporal cold war theme and I was hooked (I'm a sucker for time travel). What a series cliff hanger!!  <br /> <br />If I could give this DVD box set more than 5 stars I would. Well on Berman, Braga & Team. Sorry the series was canceled.
B00080EU58|5.0|This is the SE of Vol. 3. It includes the full original record, plus some extras. A few lives songs and some others that are not new, just haven't been put on any of their main records before. One of the extra songs is on some video game, can't remember which one right now, sorry. Fanatics will want to buy this just for the joy of owning the \\"special edition.\\" The one thing I am sad about is that the cover on the SE is way better than the cover on the original Vol. 3. I really wish they would have used this one.

B00006FDCD|1.0|Fans of this movie, take a minite to think about this: A evil clown that lives in the sewers kills children. WHAT IS THAT ALL ABOUT??!! This movie is not memorable one bit and the poorly delivered lines make me laugh. If you want a real treat read the actual book, which will certinly scare the crap out of you.  <br />Whenever I go to the circus and hear carnival music I laugh at the poor effort the producers made to capitalise off Stephen King- one of the greatest novelists of all time. <br />Bunch of communists...
B00004WGBE|5.0|Branwell couldn't have been THIS bad. <br /> <br />In studying the Bronte sisters I find it universally accepted that any male bad-behavior demonstrated in their writings was based upon their experience with brother Branwell's decline and fall due to drink and drugs (opium/laudanum (noun circa 1603 <br />any of various formerly used preparations of opium)). In 'The Tenant of Wildfell Hall', his sister Anne has penned what has been called a ...\\"response to Emily's Wuthering Heights\\" showing, I suppose, the proper reaction to such bad behavior as exhibited by Heathcliff. In 'Tenant', Anne's heroine flees in horror and hides out, attempting to support herself and raise her son away from the monster she married. In this terrific production I felt there might have been some censoring of his bad acts but as I have not yet read Anne's novel I cannot be sure. It did raise some questions for me though. There is some dispute about the cause of Branwell's disgrace. Was he dismissed from Thorp Green for seducing his student's mother, as Gaskell believes? Or did he attempt to seduce (or even succeed in seducing) his student, the young boy he was tutoring? Or, as 'Tenant' suggests to me, did he seduce the boy into use of drink and/or drugs. I think this last guess to be the most likely and in viewing this production you may come to agree. Anne was there when he was disgraced. She must have heard all of what he'd done, though she would breathe no word of it. And all she would say was that it was \\"..undreamed of experience\\" of life. <br />
B0007GAERG|4.0|Alright, Mariah's back after an almost 3 year solo haitus, and she's come back with a vengence! It's Like That was a great intro to a great album! We Belong Together gets Mariah her 16th #1, how sweet is that? Then we have the next single & my favorite track, Shake It Off! The track is just so much fun, it's amazing! Mine Again is a wonder ballad! The Neptunes produced tracks Say Somethin' & To The Floor may not be signature Mariah, but they are very catchy. Stay The Night is so emotional, & Kanye did a great job producing it. Get Your Number, the fourth JD produced track, is another catchy song. After all that, the ballad-love songs begin to roll! Your Girl, Circles, & I Wish You Knew may be considered filler, but being that they are back to back, they just seem to fit! Next is Joy Ride, which is aight. Lastly is Fly Like a Bird, which is another beautifully, emotional gospel song. Love the part where she belts \\"I need the strenth of you to survive\\" before she hits that extra high note. And for those that even think she's copying anyone else in the industry (Beyonce...) Uh, 1 year of solo hits doesn't compare to 10+, so get real.
B00097DX3U|2.0|I loved  temple of the dog, soundgarden, euphoria morning, and audioslaves first album......not to mention rage's albums.....but what the FU*K happened? this album sounds like b-sides from soundgarden and his solo album mixed with absurd guitar solo's from rage. there are only a few good songs....but their overshadowed by the other nonsense songs. i was just about to give audioslave props for perfectly bringing their 2 sounds together...but it appears the first album was a fluke...this album is evidence that their sounds should stay separate. plus....rick rubin.....if u can make artists like slayer and johnny cash sound awesome.....why cant u make this bunch of great musicians sound great. at best theyve become mediocre. im still gonna buy their albums...which is all the music industry really cares about...because i love cornell and rage....but im thuroughly dissapointed. so people interested in hearing audioslave and buying their music for the 1st time....stick to the first album..and download the good ones from their second album online somewhere...cus its not worth it. lets hope they can get their act together....or they really need to run back to their past. rage needs zack, and cornell needs...well just himslef, lol.
B0000CDLA7|1.0|It pains me to give a album with the name Dream Theater on the cover, a one star rank <br /> <br />sorry, but its the truth, and i too didnt tough this day would come... but anyways <br /> <br />i gotta say this album starts PRETTY well with As I Am, a nice heavy track and somewhat of a nice rythm, and also another of Petrucci's MONSTROUS solos <br /> <br />BUT IT DIED THERE <br /> <br />Next we have the continuation for the GODLY 6 degrees track, The Glass Prison, by the name of This Dying Soul. Even Heavier than As I Am, it would actually be nice to put this on an album, but emotionally speaking, it doesnt changes nothing from the last track and it just keeps it heavy with no high points and the same happens with the next TWO tracks!!!! <br /> <br />Endles Sacrifice and Honor Thy Father just keeps you with that heavy fast and ignorant music. Completely unnecesary. And then it changes to Vacant, the WORST Dream Theater ballad EVER!!!! (I really couldn't found a bad ballad in DT till now) and the main line changes into Stream Of Conciousness, an really nice instrumental if they hadnt made that one mistake - They got it running for WAYYYYY too long, if they cutted a lot of things out of it and made it a 5,6 minute track it would be a lot more exciting, it kind of loses meaning on the middle of it <br /> <br />And to the closure - In The Name Of God <br /> <br />the same mistake of Stream Of Conciousness, too long. <br /> <br />A complete meaningless \\"samba\\" part with John Petrucci getting faster than ever. If it Werent for that, this track would be a nice heavy and epic closure <br /> <br />Not worth the money spent, sorry new guys <br /> <br />Dream Theater started thinking that speed DOES matter and that what aint heavy aint good, all of this turned into this boring and fast CD. Perfect with you're beggining to get into Heavy Metal and wants to see how fast and heavy a human can go... but well aint that Iron Maiden eh? Just 30 years newer <br /> <br />If you want heavy music well done, and not necessarily fast -> LaBrie's new work <br /> <br />If you want a nice Prog Metal CD ----> Petrucci's new work <br /> <br />Im waiting for the next album now, and for the first time with Dream Theater, im gonna download to sse if its WORTH buying
B0007G89G4|5.0|I have always been fascinated by this film. I saw it as a first-run theater surprise, I bought the VCR edition later, and today I bought the Deluxe Edition because it seemed to offer some more stuff because it had a 2nd disk.<br /><br />As a writer in this thread observed, the second disk  is just the soundtrack, but there are two spectacular specials on disk ONE where Rob Reiner is the MC, so-to-say. Rob goes into hilarious detail about the train-on-thebridge scene and Rob's remarks are  spliced with Stephen King, Jerry O'Connell, Corey Feldman, Kiefer Sutherland, Richard Dreyfuss, and that sweet boy, Will Weaton (now grown to manhood). The editing on these interviews is superb and a Corey Feldman remark, for instance, segues perfectly with a remark from Jerry O'Connell now grownup, too; the editing gives the viewer the impression that these folks are in the same studio at the same time.  There's a sad moment when the cast alludes to the death of River Phoenix who died from a drug overdose several years after the filming of Stand By Me.<br /><br />I have always felt that Stand By Me had a homoerotic subtext, but there wasn't a nod from any of the participants about this issue, so I'll just pass.<br /><br />I might add the subtitles are in 7 languages--- an almost unheard of event these days.
B00005JNBQ|5.0|I'm typically not fond of self-conscious low-budget \\"independent\\" films and was not expecting to like this film, so I was surprised at how much I loved it and at how funny the film is. Clearly, Napoleon Dynamite has escaped a lot of the independent film traps that make them so slow and amateurish. The question then is what makes this such a great film? First, there is the main character Napoleon Dynamite, a perfectly cast nerd who possesses a steely integrity and loyalty to his friends, which makes him sympathetic. This quality is necessary for the film's climax which you'll have to see for yourself. Secondly, the film does an excellent job of capturing innnocence. There is a purity to Napoleon's character that is infectious and endearing. This quality defies those critics who accuse the film of having no heart. The next great thing about the film is the hilarious anecdotage. The writer/director draws from his life in Idaho to create one comic scene after another without trying to be funny. Napoleon's droll, intense expression as he tries to navigate through girls, his competitive brother and his charlatan uncle is classic.<br /><br />One of the wonderful things about this DVD is the director commentary where scene by scene he shares his life experiences and explains how they informed his film.<br /><br />Napoleon Dynamite belongs to the Hall of Fame list of films about misfits: The King of Comedy (starring Robert DeNiro), The Good Girl, Adaptation, You Can Count On Me, Welcome to the Dollhouse, and Ghost World.
B00005JNVS|5.0|Absolutely everything!<br /><br />-- Better fights scenes than The Matrix<br /><br />-- Better attitude than Men in Black<br /><br />-- Better chase scenes than Roadrunner and Coyote<br /><br />-- Better dialog than the Three Stooges<br /><br />-- Better sets than The Honeymooners<br /><br />The \\"Axe\\" gang moves into town, a bad-axe bunch with lines like \\"I'm the bad guy!\\" They attack the old order, en masse, with hatchets, tommy guns, tuxedos, and top hats. Once they control everything worth having, they move into the poor section, called the Pig Sty. People here make humble livings when they can, as a noodle chef, coolie, or foppish tailor raising the hem just a bit for Bucktooth Jane's attempts at selling herself (or offering short-term rentals).<br /><br />They picked the wrong chef, laborer and - in their words - fairy. These men (more or less men, anyway) have mastered mysterious martial arts, and promptly kick the goobers out of a half-hundred or so bad guys. The first round of heroes falls, but more and stronger take their places. Watch The Landlady - watch her landing, especially, after she evades a truck in that road chase. Then watch her loud Capri pants in the penultimate fight against The Beast. The ultimate battle comes after that, but I'll leave it for you to discover.<br /><br />I can't think when I last laughed that hard at a movie. It's a self-concious send-up of so many stereotypes I lost count of them all. Heck, I probably didn't even know what half of them were, in the Chinese idiom, but the satire was broad enough to enjoy anyway.<br /><br />This is insanely funny. Just take it as it comes, and try not to hurt yourself laughing.<br /><br />//wiredweird
B00097DX3U|3.0|Overall I'm not too happy with this album so far... That's not to say it's totally worthless, but in my opinion it's a step down from Audioslave's first album.  To a certain extent, its frustrating, because Audioslave are at least trying to do something different.  This album is different from the first, but not in a good way. <br /> <br />It all starts off decently, with \\"Your Time Has Come.\\" Not the best song, but serviceable. It's got a nice riff, and good lyrics to boot. Tom's solo is pretty cool as well. (4/5) <br /> <br />\\"Out Of Exile\\" isn't bad either.  It's again got a nice riff to it.  Tom's solo is a bit of a noisy mess though... And this is unfortunately rather common throughout the album.  Coming to the Audioslave merger as a Rage fan, I've always loved Tom's playing and respected his uniqueness as a guitar player.  But several of his solo's on this album just seem to be a lot of warbling noise... Too bad really.. (4/5) <br /> <br />Moving along, track three is \\"Be Yourself.\\" It's sort of a sunny, optimistic track about, yes, being yourself.  Normally I'm not a fan of the really sugary songs, but this track strikes a good balance.  It doesn't overdo the sweetness, but has good lyrics, and Tom's solo is quite nice this time around. My early choice as favourite song on the album. (4.5/5) <br /> <br />\\"Doesn't Remind Me\\" is another solid song.  It starts off with a nice little rhythm, and has some quirky lyrics... It's a bit overlong, but Tom's solo is again pretty good. (4/5) <br /> <br />\\"Drown Me Slowly\\" is the first song on the album that I just don't really like... Repetitive, not the greatest solo... Just annoying. (2/5) <br /> <br />\\"Heaven's Dead\\" is another dud. Annoying lyrics, not much a solo to speak of. (2/5) <br /> <br />\\"The Worm\\" is not bad, not good, but somewhere in between.  Nice instrumental, but the lyrics leave something the be desired, and the solo is just annoying and screechy. (2.5/5) <br /> <br />\\"Man Or Animal\\" isn't much good either.  Kind of the same as \\"The Worm\\".  Decent instrumentals, but not the best lyrics or solo. (2/5) <br /> <br />\\"Yesterday Or Tomorrow\\" is okay.  Nice instrumentals, including a good solo by Tom.  Lyrics leave a bit to be desired though.  Average. (3/5) <br /> <br />\\"Dandelion\\" crosses the line between upbeat and downright saccharine that \\"Be Yourself\\" trod so effectively.  I don't have a problem with upbeat, but this is a bit TOO sweet for me. Still, the instrumental is pretty nice (2/5) <br /> <br />\\"#1 Zero\\" is the same old story. Some elements succeed, others don't.  Lyrics are alright, instrumental is just whiny and annoying.  Decent solo though. (2/5) <br /> <br />The closer \\"The Curse\\" just drags on a bit too much. Nothing special. (2/5) <br /> <br />Overall: 34/60 <br /> <br />Closing Comments: This album gets off to a pretty good start, but after the first four tracks, things go downhill.  To critique my own reviewing, I have to say that I'm still getting used to Cornell as a singer.  I never listened to him before 'Slaves debut.  In fact, I remember being really, really bummed out after buying their debut album.  But after a number of listens through that album, I began to see the good in a lot of songs that I didn't like at first. Looking back now, there's no song on that first album that I won't listen to.  I think they are all good, but that wasn't my first impression.   <br /> <br />Cornell definitely has a lyrical style that's a bit mysterious.  He invites the listener to apply their own interpretations to what he's saying, and I found that off-putting at first, but came to terms with it.   <br /> <br />This time around, I'm again readjusting. In a lot of these tracks, I'm citing the lyrics as a shortcoming, but that's mostly because I haven't figured out that process of \\"What the heck is he talking about?\\" Maybe there's meaning to it, maybe it's just bad rehashed poetry, or maybe both.  Either way, I'm still figuring it out. <br /> <br />I've listened to the album several times, and this is my opinion so far: average, but nothing special.  But after another 10 or 15 runs through, who knows? Bottom line, if you like Audioslave, buy the album.  You might be disappointed in the overall package, but there will probably be at least a song or two here you'll enjoy, regardless of your preferences in style of music.
B00063MBU8|5.0|I went and saw SP and Good Charlotte last night in Atlanta. I love SP's new cd and the songs sound even better live. This cd deals with serious issues.....(i.e. 'Crazy' 'Untitled', and 'Welcome to my Life') while still retaining the immaturity that defines Simple Plan...(i.e. 'Shut up' 'Jump') <br /> <br />This cd is not to be missed by any true punk fans!
B00008H2LB|2.0|Back in 2000 when I first saw Linkin Park, I honestly thought they something that Rock really needed. I bought their first album,\\"Hybrid Theory\\", and thought it was a decent album that fused Rap with Rock in to a somewhat good field. But the new-found pouplarity(Especially Rapper Mike Shinoda)Linkin Park thought it would be alright to embrace a Will Smith style rap, minus the partying and the \\"uh\\" sounds Will smith makes and a kinda neo Turntable rock style that gets repetitive real fast. The result is \\"Meteora\\". A generally pleasing album for Audiences 8-13 and teenage girls. Although it does a few decent moments(Faint,Somewhere I Belong),its WAY too short and feels rushed. Linkin Park barely use actual Guitar Riffs, they don't take enough time to present any Musicanship(for a Nu-metal band),and Mike Shinoda is absoultey TERRIBLE Rapper.Another note is the heavy use of Musical Instrument samples and scrathing. Why can't they be like Ex-Rage Against The Machine Guitarist Tom Morello and scratch with strings and a Wah-Wah Pedal.Or use guest musicans like The Mars Volta to play piano and violin? Most likely because they think its not very MAINSTREAM. Overall you should just pick up more creative, musicanship-like acts like The Gorillaz's new Album \\"Demon Days\\" instead.
B00097DX3U|4.0|If you are one of those people who needed this band to sound a certain way due to the brilliance of their former incarnations, then I am sorry for your loss. If you are willing to accept that all of their individual styles would be present then welcome to a great experience. Listen to them now and hear them later.  <br />The most refreshing fact is that Cornell has taught the boys how to play a something different. Not to say the RATM boys are not talented, but if you look at the history of Chris Cornell, he has a record of solid writing. IE: Temple of the Dog. It takes a real talent to write an single album as a tribute to your friend after only your major label debut and get it signed. <br />While Audioslave's debut was a little scattered, \\"Exile\\" brings them closer to the sound they seem to be looking for. Chris is still the best rock singer alive (even though his age is showing), Tom is in true form and Brad and Tim have almost caught up.  <br />Forget where they came from and have another listen. Its all there, just different.
B00023GGFI|4.0|Always liked this album, and my favorite track was Ray Charles' \\"Drown in My Own Tears.\\" What's special about this re-release is that includes another excellently rendered soul gospel tune, \\"Two Steps from the Blues,\\" in much the same style as \\"Tears\\". When Johnny Winter steps back from the over-the-top Howlin' Wolf growl and sings in his natural voice, he's incredible. I give all four stars here for those two songs. <br /> <br />Edgar Winter, by the way, plays alto sax on this album.
B00009MGGI|5.0|Honestly, I didnt watch the last two episodes of series 1, because the evil that F.U. was doing was so, um, compelling.  And so compelling that I just had to watch the next two sets (To play the king/The final cut).  For each disk, I watched all four episodes non-stop, way past midnight.  Now I need to go back and watch the whole thing again--including the two episodes I missed. <br /> <br />Brilliantly acted by Ian Richardson, one of the most memorable performances and series that I have seen in two decades.
B0008G2IRO|4.0|I remember back in 01 when I heard a lil' song on the radio called Clint Eastwood, instantly fell inlove with it and baught the album and I was hooked!!!  Gorillaz Self titled debute album was one of the best albumst I heard in 01 and 02 and after getting G sides I've bin waiting a looooooooooooong time for when the Gorillaz would return and rock my world again.  Well, after hearing about them making a new album called Self Reject icon(later changed to demon days)I was trembling in excitement, well I went to the tower record by my house on the day of it's release and I listend to every song straight on my cd player and I must say......... <br /> <br /> <br />Ok so for people who haven't gotten this album yet, I will warn you right now, if you're expecting something like \\"tomorrow comes today\\" \\"m1a1\\" and \\"New Genious\\" or any song on the first Gorillaz album LOOK ELS WERE BECAUSE THIS ALBUM SOUNDS COMPLETLEY NEW AND FRESH!  It's as if the Gorillaz have matured more especially how Dan the Automator left.  Well I will say right now that even this NEW Gorillaz album rocks the house!  I simply love this album and listen to it everyday/night.  But.........It's no were near as good as the original, but I still love this album!  The songs feel fresh and brand new unlike G sides... <br /> <br />The best tracks on this album are hands down <br />Kids with Guns <br />O Green World <br />November has Come <br />Feel Good Inc <br />Dare <br />Alone <br />Last living Soul <br />Demon Days... <br /> <br />So there you have it...Gorillaz new album WAS worth the wait even if it isn't as good as there original but it's still an amazing album.   <br /> <br />4.7 out of 5 stars.. <br /> <br />AND ONE LAST QUESTION...now I ain't no expert on Gorillaz but can someone tell me if Dan the Automator also did the vocals in Gorillaz first album because I remember very well that there first album had like 5 tracks with this one dude who sounded nothing like 2-D, he was on the tracks for Rehash and 5/4, was that vocalist Dan the Automator or did he just do music for that album?...I'd really appreciate if someone can post me an answer on this review.and if so was that suppose to be Murdoc singing cause I heard there are 2 vocalists on Gorillaz....thanks
B00004XQP4|5.0|The CD is great Green Day is one of the best Punk bands around. Don't listen to smartest reviewer he has nothing to do with his time and listens to the music like the rest he is some what in the closet and has to keep an image.
6304779607|1.0|I saw this movie when I was 16 years old and even at that tender age knew the film was a disaster of a movie. Stallone's career really went down from this point onwards until the excellent Cop Land.<br /><br />I must admit, however, I liked the car Cobretti drove (and subsequently trashed). Hard to believe this dross was based on a novel and Stallone actually bought to turn into a screenplay. Hmmmmmmmmmmm.
006092988X|5.0|\\"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn\\" tells the story of a young Irish-American girl growing up at the turn of the 20th century. Her father is a romantic man, with musical gifts and a tendency to drink. Her mother is a practical woman, who raises her children with tough love, and works as a janitor. The protagonist, Francie, is part of an extended family each member richly drawn, and as she matures, her world evolves from the stoop of her tenement to school to college and the workplace, all seen with her unique slant. <br /> <br />I first read this book in fourth grade, and it is one that say, unlike \\"Catcher in the Rye\\" matures nicely. What moved me then, moves me now, and the author does that rare thing, gives each and every character his/her humanity. While the book is chock full of \\"Oprah\\" topics, such as alcoholism, sexual abuse and poverty, the characters are drawn as more than their various vices, far more. The protagonist at one point is chided for writing about \\"sordid\\" subjects by her English teacher, yet she quickly realizes that honesty as a writer is more important than fancy phrases and made up fantasies. So does the author. <br /> <br />Highly recommended.
B00082IJ08|5.0|I Have been gorillaz fan since day one. This New cd has been worth the wait. Go out and buy it, and love it. <br /> <br />- The Music Guy.
B000002UJQ|5.0|this record is the money, probably the greatest late nineties radiohead record of all time. i mean geez chris martin said it changed his life, and he doesn't even drink alcohol or coffee. i mean im climbing the walls just thinking about the whole issue. not as good as nirvana maybe but then again neither was the jesus and mary chain. but there are a lot of songs here, and all the tunes are groovy and they're also quite long, so you're really getting much more bang for the buck here: coming in at a crushing 3215 seconds(53 minutes, 35 seconds), we're talking only $0.004 US per second. now that's not quite as good as coldplay's parachutes at $0.003 per second, so you may need to rethink buying this one.............unless you dont like coldplay or think they're cool, or if you've already got that one. really this record is much much better than that one, but it's tough to pass up a deal like that. when you got the greatest brits from the late nineites doing their best joints ever, it's quite thug really, so just buy the record. it's cosmic gangster stuff really.
B0000508U6|5.0|What can I say about Coldplay other than the fact that they are the greatest band out right now, I think that they are not going anywhere for a longtime. This album is very sad, and when I say sad I mean it is bittersweet and the lyrics reflect a very profound mind, with scars and fears.
B00005A46T|5.0|There are some songs on this album that have a good tune and some good lyrics like, Disasterpiece, Left Behind and I Am Hated. <br />But in disasterpiece the beginning says,\\"I wanna slit your throat and f**k the woomb!\\" and thats just screwed up! but the rest of the album is diecent, defenentaly PARENTAL ADVISORY but pretty dang diecent!

B00097DX3U|3.0|\\"Out of Exile\\" is a misnomer. Have these musicians ever been in exile? Not that I recall--ever since Soundgarden's \\"Superunknown\\" and Rage Against The Machine's self-titled debut, they've been getting serious ink, enough ink to fill suburban swimming pools, enough ink to fill Bic's yearly run of round stick pens.<br /><br />Unfortunately, they're running out of ideas.<br /><br />At first, this CD sounds like it's going to be great. \\"Your Time Has Come\\" and \\"Out of Exile\\" are great performances, and it isn't until \\"Be Yourself\\" that it becomes clear that they're running in place. The song starts very promisingly, with some good, understated guitar work by Tom Morello, but Chris Cornell's lyrics sound flat and uninspiring, taking the bite out of what could have been an excellent track. \\"To be yourself is all that you can do,\\" he sings. Gee, thanks, Chris--I've never gotten that advice before.<br /><br />From there, this disc sinks into a mid-CD lull, as if they front-loaded it in the hopes that the kids skipping through the tracks at the Virgin Megastore would have decided to buy it by this point. \\"Doesn't Remind Me\\" doesn't remind me of anything I previously liked about this group, and \\"Heaven's Dead\\" doesn't come to life--these and the next few tracks are uninspiring paint-by-the-numbers routines. In the course of polishing their sound, they've flattened it out, and if they're functioning better as a band, they also don't deliver anything as visceral and captivating as, say, \\"Shadow on the Sun\\" from their debut. (That was a fantastic song--I didn't buy their debut right when it came out, but when I heard \\"Shadow on the Sun\\" near the climax of the movie \\"Collateral,\\" it immediately captivated me, becoming my very favorite song in the world for the next couple weeks.)<br /><br />Fortunately, the CD picks up for a good finish. \\"All your tomorrows shine,\\" Cornell sings on \\"Dandelion,\\" and I hope that's true for the band, too, because they're capable of great things. \\"#1 Zero,\\" a slow starter that builds to a great crescendo, proves that--kind of. One one hand, it's one of the best songs they've made, possibly the best track on the album. Still, it's nothing you haven't heard before.<br /><br />And that's the main beef with the album--there's a lot of Pixies-style quiet-verse-loud-chorus songs here, and that's a good technique, but it ended up making me wish I was listening to the Pixies, listening to alternative music that was made when alternative was fresh and new, not after it gobbled up everything in site and became a fat, lazy couch potato, good for nothing but taking up space on radio stations and record store shelves. Audioslave is a cut above most of those bands--I might have given this disc three-and-a-half stars, if that were an option--but there's still a lot of better music out there in genres that haven't yet exhausted their appeal.<br /><br />Alternative is dead. Long live alternative.lds to a great crescendo, proves that--kind of. One one hand, it's one of the best songs they've made, possibly the best track on the album.

B00080ZG10|5.0|Leonardo DiCaprio painfully utters this line as he pulled himself out of a rather spectacular crash of one of his planes he helped developed. You could call him an aviator, or a film maker, or a man with a lot of visions. The film centers on the middle of his life, probably his most successful and also his most troubled. <br /> <br />It's a fine line between ambitious and crazy. Howard Hughes wanted a lot of things to happen and got rather upset if things didn't go his way, and he liked really complicated and wild things. <br /> <br />We first see him as he's filming his film Hell's Angels, an ambitious and really expensive(4 million at the time but remember, this was the 40's, add in inflation) war epic with big spectacular dogfights. He needs 2 cameras for filming, despite the fact he already has 24. Then he wants clouds to show the speed of the aircraft, which delays the film by 3 years until a chance encounter of clouds in Oakland. So finally the film's made and it premieres to rave reviews with starlet Jean Harlow.  <br /> <br />Next he gets involved with Katherine Hepburn and heavily involved in aviation. This includes breaking the speed record and developing a plane without the top wing(for a visual idea of a top winged plane, think of the Mummy when they flew in the sand storm). He then builds the ever-massive plane he called the Hercules but has been famously referred to as the \\"Spruce Goose\\". <br /> <br />Starting to show is his OCD(Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder) who tend to do things repeatedly until they're right and have germ phobia. This results in him locking himself in his projection booth bare naked with discarded tissue and newspaper all over the floor and bottling his urine. <br /> <br />Remember that episode of the Simpsons where Burns went nuts after building his casino? This was largely inspired by Howard Hughes, including his \\"Spruce Moose\\", however his appearance in that episode was different than in the film. Why? Well apparently upon discovery of his death, he had long matted hair and a big beard and had long toenails. The film avoids this era, ending after the Spruce Goose takes off finally. Interestingly enough: his pet project only got off the ground(in this case it was water) once, as it only flew a mile and never did afterwards. <br /> <br />The performances are solid across the board with plenty of cameos such as Gwen Stafani as Jean Harlow, Willem Dafoe as a tabloid photographer, and  Brent Spiner(Data from Star Trek: TNG) as an aviation engineer. Cate Blanchett got the Oscar for her portrayal of Katherine Hepburn but Leonardo completely owns this film. When he's commanding and ambitious he pulls it off but even in his off period he's still compelling. My favorite scene is the last one where he keeps repeating \\"the way of the future\\" since OCD people tend to repeat their sentences and he finally gets a grip and sounds like he's in control but then just keeps going as he lost it. Like Catalina Sandino Moreno getting an ultrasound in Maria Full of Grace it's a wonderful performance that's just full of nuances. <br /> <br />At 3 hours it might seem a bit long but oddly enough after that final scene I still wanted to see more. Like someone's life was too fascinating for just a 3 hour film but the condensed 20 years in 3 hours we do see is very entertaining, including that unbelievable crash of his spy plane in Beverly Hills. So painful looking.

B0007Y08IS|4.0|Alot of people will dig this movie. It's accessable to mainstream audiences whether or not they get beyond the surface humor that might have linked \\"Team America\\" back to \\"Baseketball\\", but it's also damn smart on so many different levels. There's the obvious connotations of the marionettes, but they've done so much more than strip bare the Hollywood blockbusters that too many people can watch with a straight face while the rest of us stand outside the theater gagging; they've displayed the cheesiness that seeped out of michael bay movies into the modern American mentallity. During no other 20th century war has cliche fiction had so many striking similarities to our hero-enemy soap opera ideas of what liberty is. The whole election revolved around winning over public sentiment by making the war out to be a) symbolic of the liberty that founded America or b) a percieved personal attack by your dreaded antagonist. And why do politicians and the media make everything about ideas and symbolism instead of telling us the facts and letting us use our own God-given minds? The same reason we poured millions of dollars into seeing \\"Pearl Harbor\\". Team America isn't about personal stance for the most part; it's a play of what we might spend alot of money seeing in the theaters if we're the same people who buy into the idea of a world that revolves around an unrealistic good guy vs. bad guy (pick your hero first) plot.  Although Try and Matt are little more than \\"clost righties\\" as Rolling Stone just had to add for the sake of a petty slap at the right, the point of the movie isn't about who wins or loses, but rather how you play the game. This is best represented in the ingenious suicide bombing scene. While the hippocrasy of left-wing hollywood would lead us to believe that their hatred of the people who kill terrorists is equal to the terrorists hatred of left-wing Hollywood, only in the mind of a stereotypical republican would Michael Moore be capable of taking any action himself on anything (ever wonder how many of the poor people in \\"Roger & Me\\" could fit inside his mansion?), let alone literally becoming the terrorist they've made him out to be. There has, however, been alot of debate over whether this is a left or right (more commonly right) statement, and those people picked up on the final speech, but kind of missed the overall point. In the end, they finally came out and said that liberals need to allow war because it's saving their lives and allowing them to whine, but most of the movie was a satire of sleazy modern politics as a whole. I've heard people saying that the creators are liberal because they appeared in \\"Bowling for Columbine\\" (because they grew up close to Columbine geniuses) and swear alot (and that's the kind of prejudice that brought about this movie), and all I can say to those people is if your ideas are defined by those type of categories, then this movie is definately targetted at you. But is the patriotism of the right really reminiscent of the hot blooded Reagan-era action flicks this film spoofs? Is the media role-playing of the left the result of Hollywood refusing to leave childish namecalling and immature ideology to elementary school playgrounds? Well, it's never seemed so familiar and never felt so much like there's been a mudslinging contest with the tactics and wit of a simple puppet show going on right under our noses.
B0007TKNL0|5.0|Ok, how about some Musicial's 101.  I read through some of the reveiws and there seems to be some misconceptions on what musicals are all about. <br /> <br />1.  A musical means music, don't complain that there is to much music.  That's the way it's suppose to be. I you don't like musicals pdon not watch this as you will hate it. <br /> <br />2.  This is not real, it didn't happen, it's a figment of someone's imagination.  Everything doesn't need to make perfect sense. <br /> <br />3.  Michael Crawford and Sarah Brightmann are to old to play the Phantom and Christine.  Get over it. <br /> <br />4.  Suspend your belief, sit back and enjoy. <br /> <br />As a long time POTO fan, I resisted seeing this movie as I thought it couldn't  do the stage play justice.  I am happy to admit I was wrong.  You just have to remember that the stage show was a stage show and this is movie.  They are different forms of the same story. <br /> <br />In this version Gerard Butler plays a younger, sexier version of the Phantom.  I would guess woman 9 to 90 will fall in love with him, I know I did. His voice is different from Michael Crawfords, and not in a bad way.  I grew to really like his voice, it fits his personality.  <br /> <br />Emmy Rossum as Christine is lovely, innocent and niave as she should be.  I even liked Raoul in the movie as I didn't in the play. <br /> <br />All in all this movie was a delight, I recommend it to musical lovers everywhere. <br /> <br /> <br />
B000007T1M|5.0|ok.  Anyone who likes music in general should get this.  Anyone who likes metal music should get this.  The songs on this album are nothing but awesome.  The best and probably most famous off of the album is Sugar.  This song can single handily blow out anything that other bands put out in 2-3 albums put together.  Its that good.  It sursprised me on how many times i've listened to this album.  It takes a while for any SOAD album to get the hang of it.  Its a roller coaster.  As soon as things start to slow down on this album, it picks right back up in like 30 secs.  Spiders is also another good song.  This is by far SOAD's best album.  You should really start off with this album if you want to get into SOAD... if you want to just hear them.... download Sugar off of kazaa or blubster and see if you like it.  If you like bands like Slipknot or Fear Factory then you should get this.  It somtimes fades slow to fast and fast to slow... like i said before.... sorta like Metallica or Slipknot.  I would give this album 9.9 out of 10.  I would love to give 10.. but the cover could of been better... As you may know.. covers stop some people from getting an album. <br /> <br />** a rating would highly be appreciated **
B0007Y08IS|4.0|The creators of South Park  do it again and make one of the crudest and funniest movies you'll see. Not sure how Roger Ebert or anyone could just dismiss it with one star. It makes fun of politics and celebrities and pretty much everything else. They even turn Matt Damon into a moron that can just say....Matt Damon. I'm a Matt Damon fan but when he did that it always got me to laugh out loud. Plus they turn Alec Baldwin into the world's greatest actor that no one can out act.<br /><br />  I never thought a movie with puppets could be so damn funny. Even the song (Pearl Harbor Sucked but I love you) was pretty funny. Well the song went something like that. The song knocks Ben Afflick's acting skills. Even the Team America theme song is uncalled for. \\"America \\"F\\" YEAH!\\" It also offers a crude and disgusting but also hilarious sex scene. Plus there's one of the grossest longest puke scenes in the history of film. It goes on so long that it even made me start to feel sick. Still I was laughing while feeling sick.
B0007Y4TVU|4.0|I can't say that Mezmerize is bad.  But I can say that it doesn't compare to Toxicity or System of a Down.  The tracks aren't really matured.  They step up the production but other then that.. just another album from the system. <br /> <br />Soldier Side- Intro---- I would say that this song is really good.  This is them at their best in vocals.  Not much for the other instruments. Just a good simple song. <br /> <br />B.Y.O.B.--- ahh.. the first song they released.  I really like this song.  It has really good guitars and good vocals. Enough to buy the record. <br /> <br />Revenga---  This song is sorta a filler, but good music.  lyrics are weird. <br /> <br />Cigaro--- remember when i said that this album isn't really matured?  This is when that kicks into play.  The first line is \\" My c*** is much bigger then yours....\\". Cool song though. <br /> <br />Radio/Video--- This is my favorite song on the album.  It has awesome  music.  It sorta has a metal poppy sound... but it never hurts to experiement. <br /> <br />This Cocaine Makes Me Feel I'm On This Song--- Sorta filler... but cool song. <br /> <br />Violent Pornography-- cool song.  I think its average.  My friend really likes it though <br /> <br />Question!-- Good sound.. but probably the worst lyrics on the album. <br /> <br />**** I can tell you right now.. most of System of a down songs are based on the same format... so they will sound sorta the same.**** <br /> <br />Sad Statue---cool drums.  Great lyrics...probably the best on the album... b.y.o.b. would of been the best.. but settled for 2nd because of that \\"Everybody's going to the party, gonna have a real good time.\\"  I saw a clean version of this album.. they should block out that and leave the F***'s in it.  lol.. that would be cool. <br /> <br />Old School Hollywood---- This song has a cool nice sound to it.... Kinda poppy like Radio/Video <br /> <br />Lost In Hollywood---  This is an acoustic song.  Its the third best.  Has really cool lyrics... average drums... great guitars.. <br /> <br /> <br />Overall, Even though i didn't speak too much of the songs on here... still get this.. Its a geat album from a great band... Start off with Toxicity, then System of a Down, then Mezmerize, then finally, Steal This Album! They're all great albums but thats what you should do.. according to me. <br /> <br />* would really appreciate a feedback.. \\"helpful or not\\" responce *  <br />CANT WAIT TILL THE NEW ONE COMES OUT!!!!! I HEARD EARLY FALL or something.
B0002OERI0|5.0|I've been listening a lot to singers such as Simple Plan, Linkin Park, Blink 182 and some others. But I have to say this Green Day CD just blew me away.  <br /> <br />A variety of awesome songs written and sang by Green Day all in one CD! Evey single songs in the CD imediatley got my attention, how could I reject listening to one more song on the CD? It's almost impossible to walk away from listening to the songs. <br /> <br />Hey there's already two of this CD in my house running music all day long! Music to my ears! I so highley reccomend this CD! If you haven't already bought this CD where have you been the whole time? <br /> <br />

B0001GOH6Q|5.0|Who can deny about the originality and underground gaze of this filmmaker? Burton is the true authentic storyteller whose imagination has overcome the standards. From Beetlejuice through Batman I, The sleepy hallow to this trip plenty of visual elegance and arresting and captivating images all along the movie.<br />Supported by a smart script , it faces the bitter relationship between father and son. The father to my mind represents the same Burton, where imagination and reality are blended, so the limits between what's the official story and what was dreamed is difficult to definite.<br />His son grows surrounded of legends and half truths and when his father to just one step from dying. He decides to rebuilt all his father's life trying to find and establish the truth from the legend. The fish and the wedding ring is a special life lesson that will be revealed at the end. But the kinetic camera and the ravishing journey behind the great love of his father, the impressive sequence with the huge yellow narcissus carpet will be the mute witness for the materialization of that expected love.<br />Burton through this extraordinary metaphor, and visibly inspire by the magic realism -Think in Alejo Carpentier and Gabriel Garc&iacute;a M&aacute;rquez-, invites us to think and reflect about the love for the little things, to see far beyond the meaning of the things by themselves and the importance of the imagination as the true essence of a better existence. Of course there is a heartfelt homage to Wizard of Oz, in the thirties, Rene Clair's Beauties of the night in the fifties,  Mary Popins in the seventies Fellini' s Amarcord and The clowns, of the seventies, Petersen's Never ending' s story, of the eighties  and Jean Pierre Jeunet's the city of lost children of the nineties.<br />The cast is impressive Finney steals the show as the dying father, Ewan Mc Gregor as himself in his youth and the fabulous Helena Bonham Carter shines in her secondary lines with her enigmatic beauty and supreme talent.<br />Sumptuousness, and poetic rendition.ent.

B000929AJQ|5.0|When you mention NIN to anyone, the past music could be summed up with one word: angst. Even though much of Trent Reznor's last album was unfocused and weird, besides being very non-commercial, you can only be angry and full of angst for so long, to a point where that becomes cliche. Reznor wisely took a long break. He reformed the band, which includes Jeordie White. This album is also 13 tracks just over fifty minutes. Reznor has learned that less is more. The songs are brilliant. \\"All The Love In The World\\" and \\"You Know What You Are?\\" show immediately the soft and the hard side of the same coin. Then we get to the weird world of \\"The Collector\\" where all music collides. Three tracks in you realize that Reznor has decided to get more interesting on the percussion. The drum sounds are almost a fusion of drum and bass and rock drumming. \\"The Hand That Feeds\\" is a political song that recalls early NIN. Reznor proves that he hasn't lost his edge. Most of his current emotions are dealt with on \\"Love Is Not Enough.\\" He makes a lot of noise and takes us to new NIN vistas. He even plays around with retro 1980s synth sounds on \\"Only.\\" Punk rock and metal pop are words to describe \\"Getting Smaller.\\" Reznor has made an interesting album that looks to the past and looks to the future. Not many records sound like this right now, so good for him.
B0000CABBW|5.0|This picture is a sublime ode to the sea nature and it exemplifies as any other else, the nature's purposes may be far beyond of the tradition or established principles conceived beforehand.<br /><br />According the dynasty of ancient ancestors, Paikea must be a male leader, but there 's a twist of fate when two twins are born and one of them dies: the male. So this female survivor is never seen with any drop of tenderness of sympathy by her grandfather. She intends by all her means to win the trust and respect but she does not  get it.  But slowly there will be a curious events chain and slender facts that will convince him to this honorable but narrowed mind master he is wrong.<br /><br />The film elapses between rituals and touching but effective anecdotes. She never gives up in her courage to reach her place. She will break the rules and her character will face the authority more than once.<br /><br />The midnight sequence in which we watch the whales in the sand is visually poetic and extremely haunting.<br /><br />Niki Caro threw once more her hat to ring with this admirable film, plenty of metaphors and mythological learning in which the nature is present ominously, through the greenness, the wind and the sea: the symbol of the life, according the mythical gaze.<br /><br />Few times the cinema has been under the nature's service as in this case. There are other notable films as Flaherty's Nanook of the North, Herzog's Fata Morgana or Roeg's Walkabout for instance, but this film shines with resplendent brilliancy.
B0000CDLA7|1.0|DO not buy this album- please buy symphony x, adagio, porcupine tree, or other DT albums- this is the WORST \\"prog\\" album in recent history
B00006AW2G|5.0|Yeah, click on Mr. Finnland's reviews and you will find that he apparently dislikes pretty much everything, and has spent a great deal of time putting bad reviews on things he hates.  (He is apparently incredibly stupid and just goes around buying every album of every band he hates, so he can review them like he knows what he's talking about.)  Who knows what he actually likes, but if he doesn't like the Rolling Stones, he must not be from earth.  Please get a life, Mr. Finnland, you are a soulless idiot.  Ignore him, as another review states, he is full of bull, this is a great album, one of the classic Stones.  Of course, you can't really go wrong with the Stones or the Beatles in their prime, I recommend any you can get your hands on.  About Led Zepplin, I am not too into it myself, but I haven't really listened to much, it just doesn't turn me on as much from what I have heard, but that is just my taste, I'm sure they're music is fine.  The Finn a--hole is giving them a bad name, if he actually likes them. <br /> <br />(Note: Who knows what planet the Finn guy is from, he's probably just jerking everyone's chain or something, so I hate to even rise to it, but whatever, ignore him.)
B00082IJ08|1.0|If you enjoy listening to music on your iPod or Windows XP based computer then this is not the album for you. Virgin Records America appears to have decided to copy protect the release of Gorillaz 'Demon Days'. The disc will not play when inserted into a Windows XP based computer (i.e. when browsing to the disc from your My Computer icon the disc appears to be blank).<br /><br />This album is ideal for your car, home audio cd player, or portable cd player if your playback device is compatible with the copy protection contained within this release.<br /><br />One should also note that there is no notice of copy protection nor compatibility requirements anywhere on the packaging of the Gorillaz 'Demon Days' album.<br /><br />If you have purchased this CD and wish to contact Virgin Records then do not bother attempting to e-mail their web master from the Virgin Records web site: all e-mails bounce back as being undeliverable. A more appropriate title for this album would have been \\"Paying Customers are Thieves\\".
B00082IJ08|5.0|A few months ago I stumbled upon Gorillaz on the iTunes store, and I was hooked. What could be cooler than a cartoon band? I began to listen to there debut album and I loved what I heard. I couldn't wait when I discovered that they had a new album that would be coming out in a few months. So when the new CD finally arrived I bought a copy, and I was extremely satisfied with my purchase. In fact I even liked the new album more than their previous album. The reason being is that Demon Days contains many extremely catchy toons which are very enjoyable. This new CD  has better thought out songs with catchy vocals, unlike some songs on the debut album (M1-A1, Punk, Double Bass). I would recommend buying this album!
0312958455|4.0|\\"Everybody counts, or nobody counts\\". Isn't that what any fair-minded person wants to believe about those who protect and serve. That's what makes you like Detective Harry Bosch, despite his many character flaws, deep down he's a good man. Even though in this story he's more uncompromising and on edge. He's filled with a lot of rage at the police, the system, and the suspects who murdered his mother over thirty years ago. A good cop thriller you won't be disappointed. Great writing.
B0000CDLA7|1.0|I love Dream Theater, but this album is for me the biggest disappointment in prog music. It's definetely their worst studio album. It's monotonous, repeating, with interjected John's solos which are technically perfect, but not captivating. I also miss Jordan's keyboards and Mike's typical drums. It seems to me that they lost invention, they repeat the parts from their previous albums (especially mid part of \\"This Dying Soul\\" is pure copy of \\"Glass Prison\\"), but this I wouldn't mind the most. The worst is that the whole album reminds me of Metallica, at first I didn't want to admit it, but it's a matter of fact. I hope that they won't go this way.
B000062XGB|5.0|If you like Oscar and Hammerstein's The King and I, be aware that this is different. Jodie Foster may have trouble with the English accent, but I think only she could fulfill the part of the lovely, but lonely school teacher Anna. Chow Yun Fat shines in his role as King Mongkut of Siam. Together they make a love story that streches across the world. Could it be possible that two different people from two different world's could find out that they're hearts are forever intwined with each other? Should they think of the social concept of husband/ wife in the 1860's, or follow they're hearts? A true love story for any age, and a great family film.
B0000CDLA7|1.0|This album is not good. <br />In a way it's a shame I don't like it - it's been touted as Dream Theater's heaviest yet, closest to thrash metal, furthest from prog-metal. I like heavy metal; I like crunchy riffs; I don't mind a lack of melody. I saw Dream Theater cover Metallica's Master of Puppets in its entirety at a concert in New York, and it was awe-inspiring. I was hoping they'd take that early-Metallica influence and do something cool with it. Instead, they've come up with their most tedious album since... uh... their last one. Sigh. <br /> <br />Train of Thought is tedious in an entirely different way than Six Degrees of Inner Turbulence was. While it's chock full of similarly forgettable songs, they're forgettable mostly because they consist in large part of tired heavy metal riffs played really fast over. and. over. again. Keyboards play a much lesser role on this album; I never thought I'd miss the presence of Jordan Rudess (for a while I blamed him for Dream Theater's decline into suck-hood), but cmon! Anything to get Petrucci to quit rambling! <br /> <br />So, yeah - Train of Thought is basically devoid of memorable melodies (the ballad \\"Vacant\\" is laughable and extraneous); and although it contains a few riffs that are pretty potent, most of them sound recycled and, frankly, dull. And none of them are potent or interesting enough to sustain songs that almost invariably extend to ten exhausting minutes or more. <br /> <br />This review might be a little overly harsh. It just pisses me off that a band I used to like so much, and a band with so much techincal talent, can put out such garbage. I mentioned on a message forum that maybe Dream Theater should just become a Metallica cover band instead of trying to write their own songs. These days, I'd like them much better that way. It's going to take a serious turnaround for these guys ever to get my attention again. <br /> <br />Thank goodness I'm finished with this review, so I don't have to listen to thisalbum ever again. <br /> <br />
B000001FYL|5.0|THis is really one of the best albums by bon jovi or any other group from that era. all i can say is that they dont make albums like this anymore. if you like those new rock groups like kid rock and limp bizkit and stuff you should consider getting this album cos you can bet your ass kid rock and the  limp bizkit guys all have this album at home.
B0007TKNL0|5.0|Excellent!!  The movie is much better than the Broadway production - better character development, better acting, better singing.  Madame Giry is a much more intriguing character in the film.  Christine's attraction to the Phantom is more understandable and believable. Plus, we get to see the Phantom's past and why he is the way he is.   <br /> <br />In response to the comment about the sword fight:  The Phantom would know very little about fencing because he's lived alone beneath an opera house all his life.  You must practice fencing to become good at it. <br /> <br />All of my family members (ages from 10 to 47) highly recommend the film version of The Phantom of the Opera.  (good music, comedy, suspense, romance, lavish costumes and sets)
B0000CDLA7|1.0|Its over. Thanks Drem Theter...You gave us two masterpieces; I&W and Awake. <br /> <br />Since Kevin Moore gone, the band was bound to die and the moment has come.  <br /> <br />At least you invented another musical genre: Progressive Nu-Metal lol.
0790731452|4.0|There is nothing serious about this film. It is satire all the way and it is very good satire which takes potshots at all sorts of institutions. <br /> <br />The story is as simple as an old B/W science fiction movie. Earth is being invaded by Martians with superior techology and little reguard for eathlings. Instead of being an \\"end of the world\\" type picture, however, it is  comedy. It is comdedic because there is a grain of truth in the elements used for the comedy: <br /> <br />The President is worried more about poll numbers on reactions to the Martians than about invasion. <br /> <br />The first lady is worried more about interior decorating than advancing ray guns. <br /> <br />The egghead professor manages to be wrong about just about everything he speaks of. <br /> <br />Reporters are shallow and vain. <br /> <br />The military just wants to play with its toys. <br /> <br />Bad music can be a deadly influence. <br /> <br />New Age people haven't a clue as to the real world. <br /> <br />Teenagers often have a better handle on things than the grownups. <br /> <br />It's enough to make you root for the Martians. This one is fun, irreverant and a feast of oddball ideas. What else could be expected from Tim Burton?

B0002858YS|5.0|Love it, love it, LOVE IT! If you're an 80's child like myself, this is the album for you. Combining the likes of U2, Duran Duran, The Cure, Depeche Mode, and the likes, The Killers integrate their storytelling of murder, mystery, androgyny, lust, jealousy & deception into 11 (not 17, HA!) compelling tracks. This Vegas-bred group (no, I'm not biased) knows where it's at! Mr. Flowers' AM radio-ish monotonish vocals, not to mention his cutie-boy looks, evokes emotion in his stylings accompanied with his 80's-style keyboard licks is just the icing on the cake to this wonderfully talented group.
B00097DX3U|5.0|This is simply the BEST album I've heard in a long time. Of course, I'm of the opinion that Chris Cornell is among the best singers of \\"All Time\\", and I happen to get off on the way he writes lyrics. I love the fact that I can imply my own personal interpretations upon the meaning (It makes them that much more personal). If you're one who \\"doesn't get it\\"; I'm sorry. Your really missing out. What RATM needed all along was a REAL singer, and do they ever have one now. <br />     \\"THE WORM\\" is wicked, should wind up a classic. Best song on the album, IMO. The best \\"pop\\" song on the album is \\"DOESN'T REMIND ME\\". It's a straight up rock n' roll song, and its really good. <br />     As many others, I came into this band from the Chris Cornell side (Temple of the Dog, Soundgarden), so I am very familiar with his stylings. I especially enjoyed Euphoria Morning.  If you are from the same vein, you will most assuredly love this album. The band has gotten really tight, and sound like they belong toghether. They are different than Soundgarden, but (dare I say it), they are at least as good.
B0007DAZW8|5.0|It was a joyful night.  I started with the regualr Zongamin for night, but then I got an invite from a friend into his car.  He told me about this CD he has been listening to and asked me to try and figure out who it was.  He and I are big fans of Interstella 5555 and Discovery, who couldn't be?  Both of us enjoy Ratatat, Yip-Yip and Zongamin, but what we were listening to was like watching the Big Bang! <br /> <br />As we listened to Daft Punk's newest album, Human After All, we became hypnotized.  Everything merged and fused together to make this.  Take the energy of Discovery, throw in the guitar synth of Ratatat and the disco beats of Zongamin and you get Human After All. <br /> <br />The first three tracks, are some of my favorite all time songs.  They are the prime time of our lives, thats for sure.  I've been enjoying this album for a long time, and it will definately make it on my top 10 albums of all time, along with their other two. <br /> <br />You're watching, well listening, to this band emerge into something amazing.  This will be one of those albums of the decade, and it should be, just like all Daft Punk stuff.

You say its about friends when its really An attack on the apathy of our own  <br />generation. He probley lived under a bridge and your just a moron to find the information on it. Nevermind ended a generation and defined a new one. The only thing I can cpmpare Nevermind to is a Phoenix. It destroyed a musical generation and rose from the ashes of it. I listened to Gouge Away by the Pixies and although it is a good song It sounds very little like Nirvana. Just the vocal sounding. I like Peral Jam but they will always be second to Nirvana. Nevermind is the greatist album of the past 25 years. We may not have Kurt but at least we have the music.
B0000027RL|4.0|I like Pearl Jam alot. Ten is a great album. Pearl Jam is one of the greatist rock bands in the past 25 years. I dont understand the arrgument between Pearl Jam and Nirvana. I prefer Nirvana and thats my opinion. I was reading in a magazine the other day about Pearl Jam was opening for Nirvana and Pearl Jam did \\"Smells Like Teen Spirit\\" for there last song and when thy went of Eddie said to Kurt \\"Remember we did it first\\". I almost died laughing. Ten is one of the greatist albums in the past 25 years. Pearl Jam is in the top 10 of the greatist rock bands of all time.
B00005JNVS|4.0|My 10 year old son and I enjoyed this movie immensely.  Fallen, tired heroes battle an evil gang of organized crime.  There is much violence but very little gore---it may not be appropriate for kids under 10 or 12.

B0001NBMBC|1.0|Okay I've hated slipknot since they've come out. The guys are afraid of being big that is why they were the mask. This music is horriable. I dont know why any wants to listen to it. Most of the people who listen to this music are rejects at some high school that one day when they were turned down by all the popular kids instead of saying hey its okay not to be popular but instead there like NO were going to make the most scariest stuff and say you cant join. Come on listen to real music. I listened to metal from were it began. I started listing to Steppenwolf and started listing to Led Zepplen who is the greatist rock band of all time. After I heard LZ I was like can metal get any better and no it couldnt. It went all down hill and it has hit rock bottom and started to dig into the ground at slipknot. Thanks Slipknot for killing metal.
B0002G2B2M|5.0|When I saw this movie in the theater, it made me cry AND laugh.  The writing was genius - a love story told in reverse, from the disasterous ending to the hopeful, cautious beginning.  When you watch this movie, it reminds you of your own disaster-ending relationships - who hasn't ended a relationship at some point on such bad terms, that you can no longer remember any of the reasons you fell in love with the person in the first place?  Gondry and Kaufman have done an amazing job, making a unique movie that forces you to think AND enjoy the visuals.  This is not a movie that you're going to enjoy if you prefer to just stare at the screen, and expect the movie to explain things the way they would a 5-year old.  The best movie of 2004.
B0007Y08IS|1.0|I believe that this movie will strike a chord with teenagers and people who believe that vulgarity equals humor. Since there is no real plot and the attempts at laughter fall flat for the most part, I found myself fast forwarding most of the movie. The best part of the movie is actually in the DVD extras which gives a behind the scenes look at the making of the movie. Other than that, it's just a bad movie, period.
B00000272N|5.0|Alice in Chains produced a great first cd with Facelift. Lane Staley's voice coupled with Jerry Cantrell's guitars and lyrics created one the greatest grunge rock bands ever. You won't find a bad song on this cd.  For the lovers of true rock, i.e. Metallica, Godsmack, and STP, this cd, along with all of AiC's others, is a must have.
B00064ADR0|5.0|I'm new to Johnny Winter. I recently purchased his remastered debut. This second release is amazing. The guitar playing is mind blowing and I absolutely love Mr. Winter's vocals. I believe his version of &quot;Johnny B. Goode&quot; is best I've ever heard. If that wasn't enough the bonus disc featuring a concert from Royal Albert Hall recorded in 1970 that is the icing on the cake and then some. Hearing this different version of &quot;Frankenstein&quot; was great especially that drum solo. This concert could've been released separately and would have stood out on it's own and possibly may have been a classic live album. Nonetheless, it is a great bonus disc. I strongly recommend this release to anyone who love blues and/or rock.
B000002U82|3.0|I'm not going to make a speech, but at least Pink Floyd was original enough to come up with thier own style
B0007VZ9DK|3.0|Why do the studio's keep churning out movies without any real difference?<br /><br />I mean Casino was known at the time of release to have been cut down to get an R rating. But here in the rerelease we get yet the same version of the flick as before with a better picture and not the different soundtrack. Sounds alot like Scarface to me.<br /><br />The audio com's as cool as they are, are not that worthy of repeat listening.<br /><br />SO what else does this \\"new\\" double DVD have? Alternate Ending? No. Double disc? No. Uncut version of the film? No. Retarded extras that you would only view once with nothing added to the film? Yup.<br /><br />Waste your money if you want, I smell a 20 year Special Edition waiting in the wings.<br /><br />Thanks.<br /><br />Oh and if this review seems like a copy of the one I did for GoodFellas...it's because it is...only slightly different.<br /><br />B.
B00005O438|5.0|On the Website [...] it states under the movie Cujo that \\"Five Saint Bernards were used,one mechanical head and a guy in a dog costume.To make the St Bernards attack the car,animal trainers put the dogs favorite toys inside the car so the dogs would try to get them!\\"That is amazing!Personally I detest all dogs other than poodles,maltese,shelties and sighthounds so I found the movie funny to say the least!I just wanted to go into the movie and cut the St Bernard in half with a chainsaw and end it that way.Big Dogs are so seemingly nice.This portrayl showed the true viciousness that lurks in every crappy useless cumbersome stupid ugly big dog whether or not it has rabies.
B0002OERI0|5.0|This CD is perfection.  Thank god someone like Greenday spoke out, we need bands like them to be our voices.  The album flows perfectly from song to song and you will end up listening to it over and over and over again and never get tired of it, unless of course you are someone who is blind to the world and the mess we are in, and in that case I could care less what you think and I doubt Mike, Billy, or Tre do either. BUY THIS CD!
0385510454|2.0|The Broker is comparable to The Pelican Brief in its plot- one individual being chased by the CIA, FBI, and professional assassians from different terror organizations, but the similarities end there: Whereas The Pelican Brief is intriguing and suspenseful, The Broker is dull and boring.  At times it felt like I was reading an Italian travel book.  Do not waste your time/money on Grisham's latest \\"bestseller!\\"
B00079018K|4.0|One of the reviewers (I believe from Maine) wondered where he or she heard \\"Club Foot\\" after listening to it on a CD playing from a car radio.  I had same experience when listening to it on an airplane-- I know I first heard this song in a commercial for the new Pontiac Solstice.
B000024IFB|5.0|After \\"Off The Wall\\", \\"Thriller\\" and \\"Bad\\", there weren't too many places for Michael Jackson to go. He had survived his 1993 criminal allegations, but his music was faltering. \\"HIStory\\" contains fifteen big hits on the first disc and fifteen other songs on the second. It could have barely survived with the latter disc as a new album. There are some upbeat funk-rock numbers like, \\"This Time Around\\", \\"D.S.\\" and \\"2 Bad\\", but the rest seem to flounder. \\"Scream\\" (a duet with sister Janet) is an incomprehensive mess and \\"HIStory\\" is six and a half minutes of sound bytes! The ballads, \\"Stranger In Moscow\\", Earth Songs\\" (particularly pretty) and \\"Childhood\\" fare well enough, however. The trouble with this set is that the first CD seems to say, \\"This is what I gave you\\" and the second says, \\"This is what I got\\". The second CD is nearly biographical in its lyric and it's not pleasant. Ending with \\"Smile\\" is as pure narcissism as one can get. Sure Jackson had some bad breaks, but he sure had some damn fantastic ones too. Half of the songs on the new CD should have been shelved, but that wouldn't have bided well with sales. As honest as Michael Jackson might be, he is still selling Michael Jackson.
B0002Y4T92|4.0|I put aside my envy to watch the experts play.  I was disappointed in some of the tune choices.  Larry Carlton is far better than what is shown.  John Mayer is a much better instumentalist than I expected.  ZZ Top is.... well, just the best little band in Texas!  Clapton is gracious in his accompaniments and comments.
B0001L3LUE|5.0|Rather than simply covering the Viet Nam war, Robert McNamara covers his entire career, from service in the Air Force in WWII into touching on his World Bank service.  You will find out many things one never knew (or remembered).  The fire bombing of Tokoyo, but who realized that there were about 67 other cities firebombed?  He touches on the morality of that practice.  How tantalizing the idea of how the Viet Nam war might have been had Kennedy lived and Diem not been overthrown.  This is a documentary with a viewpoint, and that viewpoint is reinforced with the rapid presentations of images on the topics covered.  Sometimes you wanted to say -- slowdown.  Despite efforts of the interviewers to elicit a more detailed response on his feelings on the Viet Nam war, Robert McNamara declines to elaborate further than he has in the film, and invites viewers to read his books.  This film is quite a frank discussion of the highs and lows of his service. <br /> <br />Some of the language within the documentary has parallels with the current world situation, as regards statements about bringing democracy to Viet Nam, and how well the training of the Viet Nam army was going.  There is also good background in how the lack of understanding and knowledge of the other side's positions hampered significantly in what we did. <br /> <br />This is a very worthwhile documentary film.  Whether you think Robert McNamara was a hero or not, his role and career certainly spanned a large portion of recent American history.
0385335482|3.0|I laughed out loud at this book (although thats not that surprising from me) and most of the antics of Becky were pretty funny.  However it's hard to actually care about a character who just doesn't learn her lesson and continues to lie to everyone around her.  She's likeable enough in her funny ways of rationalizing everything and you want her to win in the end but it'd be nice if she learned a few things form her mistakes.  I liked \\"Can you Keep a Secret?\\" better.
B00082IJ08|5.0|This is definitely the best album I have heard this year, although my exposure to today's music isn't exactly all encompassing.  As other people have said, this second album is different than the Gorillaz' first one. The absence of Del really hurts the rap segments in this second album.  This is not to say the hip hop is bad, it's just that in the first album, Del WAS Russell and it's now hard to separate the two.  As a long time Blur fan though, I like Damon's voice which is (as usual) found throughout the album.  The beginning tracks and the end ones are the strongest.  The middle ones are not bad, just weaker than the other parts.  However, the album is really cohesive and looking at the pictures and the lyrics (found online) you can really see a message. <br /> <br />As for the people trying to rip the tracks off the CD, I had no problem using abcde on my NetBSD box to convert the tracks to .ogg files (in fact there are already two CDDB entries for the CD, meaning people have been ripping the CD).  It could just be a Windows thing, which sucks for you guys, because I can listen to the songs on my iRiver.  Also there is a pretty cool remix of Feel Good Inc and Cake's Never There online.  Just google \\"gorillaz cake feel good\\" and you'll find it.
B00097DX3U|5.0|First of all, 12 songs is a bit short, especially since they have a repertoire of over 20 to pick from (hopefully this means they will release another album soon.)  <br /> <br />The new album is faster and much different than the first. The extra touring has really helped in this department. With the first album, I liked it, but I didn't find myself humming the tunes too often. That is not the case with this great cd. <br /> <br />Your Time Has Come - YTHC is a fast and fun rocker. I was a bit suprised when they released it as their second single, it is still awesome. <br /> <br />Out Of Exile - This song quite possibly might be the best on the album. It again is fast paced and fun. It starts with a driving drum beat and morphs into a cool guitar riff. The solo is once again spectacular from the inhuman Tom Morello. <br /> <br />Be Yourself - Hmm... This song is slow, simple, and inspiring... Not what you would expect from an alt-metal band. It is very mainstream however and has gotten much air play because of it.  <br /> <br />Doesn't Remind Me - This song you either love or hate. It is a country-ish (again showing the change in Audioslave, and their lack of fear to change) ballad which again culminates in a spectacular Morello guitar solo. Whether it has deeper meanings about love or just a list of things that don't remind Cornell of anything, this song is fun. <br /> <br />Drown Me Slowly - Easily my favorite song on the new album. And for all you rage fans, the Bulls on Parade scratching solo is BACK! If you don't find yourself nodding your head to this songm there is something wrong.  <br /> <br />Heaven's Dead - HD is a slow smouldering rocker that never really goes anywhere. This one is a bit more radio friendly, but those looking for a fast paced rage-esque sound won't like it.  <br /> <br />The Worm - This song was my favorite at first, but as I listened to it more and the other ones, it has fallen in my book. It's very dark and has a killer riff. The soloon this song from Morello is... interesting, to say the least. It has a very space-age sound and is almost hard to listen to. Otherwise, this fast rocker is a great listen. <br /> <br />Man Or Animal - The last of the fast rockers on this album, this song is very powerful. The guitar riff is very simple, but added with the strong Wilk driven drums, this song drives ahead. The solo is very crazy and very Rage like, making this song complete.  <br /> <br />Yesterday to Tomorrow - This song is beautiful. You can see the influence of Cornell's new wife in this song. It builds up and has a very nice solo by Morello that actually fits in the song. Commerford's bass work is also very nice in this song. <br /> <br />Dandelion - Ugh. Think of what a song with the title \\"dandelion\\" would be about, and you probably hit it right on the head. This ballad to Cornell's daughter has such hard lyrics as \\"A yellow flower with your pedals to the air and flying on paper wings that brought you here.\\" This song is medium tempo and is uplifting and cute. Next. <br /> <br />#1 Zero - 1Z is probably the most complete song on the album. It starts off slow as Cornell brews about a stalker, and culminates in a rocker for the ages. The guitar work is excellent in this song. <br /> <br />The Curse - A filler if I ever saw one. This song is boring and usually gets skipped. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
0393320928|3.0|I enjoyed this book, but am surprised at how many people (including Feynman himself) seem have bought into the myth that Feynman was the one who worked out what went wrong with Challenger. NASA were well aware of the cause of the disaster long before Feynman came on the scene! If you do not believe this, then read the chapter entitled \\"Afterthoughts\\" at the end of the book - making appropriate allowances for Feynman's huge ego. From the point of view of protecting people's careers, it was much better to have the Great Feynman explain the problem with the O-rings to an astonished public after months of careful investigation than simply to name and shame those responsible for the faulty design and/or operation of the shuttle. The notion that the problem could only be solved by one of the greatest minds in theoretical physics was obviously good for NASA as it took away some of their own responsibility. <br />
B0002I831S|4.0|Great acting (really!), clever directing, mostly wonderful scripts in season 1.  But the extras are inadequate. For this price, there should be commentary on EVERY episode.  Good grief, Paramount, you've made billions on Star Trek and its myriad spin-offs.  You owe its fans a complete package.
006441034X|5.0|One of the best things about this book is the complete and wonderful randomness of the homour found within!  Dianne Wynne Jones is really a genius!  This book is really a sparkling gem amongst all books!  I had to read it again and again!!!! <br /> <br />This story is about Sophie Hatter, a young girl who works in a hatshop, and is convinced that, since she is the eldest of three sisters, she will fail at everything, just like in all the fairy tales.  When she is enchanted to be an old woman, she seeks refuge in the sinister castle of the \\"evil\\" Wizard Howl, hoping to find a way to break the curse.   <br /> <br />From enchanted \\"dogs\\" to fire demons, from cream cakes to green slime- This is one of the very best books you will ever read!!!!
B0002JJBZE|4.0|As good as season 1 is, season 2 of Star Trek, the Original Series, tops it.  There are only a few \\"average\\" scripts; mostly really shine, especially when compared to \\"Voyager\\" or,(ugh) \\"Enterprise\\". <br /> <br />Yes, great acting, clever direction, stellar (no pun intended) scripts...and all done in 1967-68.  Waaaaay ahead of its TV time. <br /> <br />However, the extras on this set leave MUCH to be desired.  Come on, \\"Seinfeld\\", one of TV's groundbreaking comedies, has commentary on every episode--Star Trek, unquestionably TV's most influential sci-fi series--deserves at LEAST as much respect from its parent company.
B0001NBMBC|5.0|This is by far the best Slipknot CD, You cannot possibly get tired of this CD its that good, and for you parents that dont let your children listen to Parential Advisory well good news this CD does not have any profane language nor does it need it i bought this CD for my 10 yr old nephew he loves it.. A must have CD for any Collection~!
B000002JS8|5.0|this albom was my 1st ac\dc albom. When i listen to  it the 1st time i desided to listen to it again.I loved it. Every song was well thought out and well played. There was only about 1 curse word or less in the whole albom. <br /> <br />Do you know what rap stands for ? I do its retared atemped poetry.So f*** you 50 cent <br /> PS rap is only \\"yoyoyoyo im great\\"
B0007Y4TVU|5.0|This is the best S-O-A-D CD, It will match or even top Toxicity's sucess. This CD brings out S-O-A-D's true Metal Roots <br />with lots of speed rifs and great singing by both Serj Tankian and Daron Malakian. Daron Has alot more air time in this CD than in the other ones. A MUST HAVE S-O-A-D CD~!
B00000GAIW|5.0|AQUALUNG was the first of three concept albums released by Jethro Tull in the early Seventies. [The other two were 1972's THICK AS A BRICK and 1973's A PASSION PLAY.]  The eleven songs on the original album loosely center around the concept that believing in the teachings of the church (specifically the Church of England) and believing in God are not the same thing. Listen to the repeated refrain from \\"Wind Up\\":  \\"I don't believe you/You had the whole damn thing all wrong/He's not the kind you have to wind up on Sundays.\\"<br /><br />But, to tell the truth, this is my favorite Jethro Tull album because of the songs, the melodies, the incorporation of English folk; not because of the preachings of flautist/singer Ian Anderson, who wrote all of the songs. [Note: Anderson's first wife Jennie is credited with co-writing the lyrics to the title track.]<br /><br />There are delicate acoustic numbers like \\"Cheap Day Return\\" and \\"Mother Goose,\\" as well as the harder rocking FM radio standards like the title track, \\"Cross-Eyed Mary\\" and \\"Locomotive Breath.\\"  The album also yielded the group's first U.S. charting single when \\"Hymn 43\\" reached No. 91.<br /><br />This edition also includes a number of bonus tracks.  First, there is \\"Lick Your Fingers Clean\\" (a song originally planned for inclusion on the album, but wasn't released until 1988's box set 20 YEARS OF JETHRO TULL) and a quad version of \\"Wind Up,\\" then a nearly 14-minute interview with Ian Anderson about the album (among other things, he talks about the number of overdubs \\"Locomotive Breath\\" required before getting the right sound). This is followed by three BBC radio broadcasts dating from 1968-69, \\"Song for Jeffrey,\\" \\"Fat Man\\" and the instrumental \\"Bouree.\\" This is the definitive Jethro Tull album  ESSENTIAL
B0007TKNIS|1.0|I was appalled by the general quality of the film. However, I was more flabbergasted by the ratings given. The jumping scenes are awkward, the acting (especially that of Emmy) is horrendous, and man, the singing, is even worse than being amateurish. Any member from my choir could out-sing Butler or Emmy. I stopped watching after 30 minutes through the film. Honestly, I RARELY give up on a film.
B0002IVN9W|5.0|I was lucky enough to catch U2 in Boston on May 26th.  As per usual, the Fleet Center were playing music over the PA before U2 took the stage.  Then, the lights dimmed a bit, the U2 stage lights started to power up and over the PA came this amazing sound.  I'd never heard the song, but I was stunned.  At this point, the U2 stage lights were glowing red, and the song was getting louder and louder.  I could not believe this sound!  Turns out U2 are playing \\"Wake Up\\" by The Arcade Fire, just before they take the stage.  Buy this CD now.
B00080ZG10|4.0|It was bound to happen.  Even in death, Howard Hughes remains capable of drawing different reviews about his life.  This film, if nothing else, reflects how Hughes did things his own way and created his fortune by walking to the beat of his own drum.  Does that create sound entertainment?  Probably not.  But it did create the right mixtures for Hughes to be one of the nation's most memorable millionaires in history.<br /><br />The film attempts to explain the factors that made Hughes different and eccentric.  From his mother warning him of the dangers of germs that forever would haunt him with each spec of dust caught by his ever cautious eyes, to the need to possess of the cheesecakes of his era, including Katherine Hepburn...not an easy catch by any means...to his attempt to take on congress and the U.S. government system as a whole.  Had Hughes ever attempted to play the \\"game\\" he probably would have been more successful, yet his memory would never have been as enduring as it is now.<br /><br />The acting in the film is decent.  DiCaprio gives a strong performance, given the limitation of the character he was playing and Cate Blanchett steals the scenes with her memorable interpretation of a very complicated Katherine Hepburn.  One almost forgets that the root of the story, and Hughes passion, was truly flying over profits.  An entertaining story of a man whose image and memories will never die.<br /><br />Frederick A. Babb
B00005QDW5|4.0|\\"Echoes\\" is a 2-CD Pink Floyd set that leans heavily on their mid 1970s glory period. Most of the Pink Floyd songs still heard in classic rock rotation can be found here, and this set is a good choice for newer fans who want to learn a little more about the band. This is *not* the Compleat Pink Floyd, nor does it claim to be. It's simply a collection of some of their best known tracks, just as \\"Remasters\\" was a collection of some of Led Zeppelin's best material. Instead, we are treated to some of Floyd's moodiest pieces, along with some of Dave Gilmour's unforgetable solos. At their best, Pink Floyd excelled at melding British songwriting craft to both heavy psychedelic rock and mellower blues/jazz. <br /> <br />Some of the longer songs on \\"Echoes\\" are re-edited, which will annoy some purists and delight collectors who simply must have all the alternative mixes. Special care was taken in sequencing the songs on the CDs; songs from different albums appear right after one another, giving the songs a novelty and freshness they haven't had for a while. The sequencing also disguises the fact that early Floyd was recorded on primitive 4-track, late Floyd was recorded on multi-track, and mid-period Floyd was recorded by Alan Parsons on 16-track equipment.  <br /> <br />You won't find obscure material from Floyd's late 1960s soundtracks, or several late 1960s songs such as \\"Saucerful of Secrets\\" or \\"Careful with that Axe Eugene\\". Also missing are some 1980s hits like \\"On the Turning Away\\" and \\"One Slip.\\" Oddly enough, the very well-known \\"Breathe\\" and \\"Brain Damage/Eclipse\\" from the \\"Dark Side of the Moon\\" album are missing. <br /> <br />If you're looking for a Floyd Anthology, this is really your only choice. Diehard Floydians will want to pass this one over in favor of buying the entire Floyd catalogue, but more casual fans might only want this and perhaps one or two of Floyd's 1970s albums. The choice is yours, as all of Floyd's key albums are still in print and readilyavailable.
B00097DX3U|1.0|if you enjoyed either soundgarden or rage you will not enjoy this.  after hearing chris cornell's incredibly weak solo album i am not surprised that he is affiliated with such an edgeless, crappy generic sounding album but I am surprised the rage boys would allow their names to be put on this garbage. <br /> <br />listening to this album for the first time I thought of Van Halen with Sammy Hagar - cheesy with hints of better things in the past.   <br /> <br />i hope this is the last audioslave album as i am worried that this music will sufficiently taint all involved in mh mind that i will think of audioslave when i reach for a soundgarden album or a rage album and enjoy them less as a result. <br /> <br />i am shocked that this album has as many positive reviews as it does and sadly enough the song you hear on the radio is probably the best of the bunch (be yourself).  a song that has nothing more original to say than \\"be yourself that's all that you can be\\" and lacks any strong riffs is the class of the field?  sad but true.  <br /> <br />a parting thought.  i have a long standing debate with my best friend regarding whether chris cornell is a grunge guy turned pretty boy or just a meathead.  we have both finally agreed that he is a meathead - he was just propped up by his voice and other talented musicians during the soundgarden years. <br /> <br />i actually hope soundgarden do NOT reunite as i think chris cornell is too far gone and matt cameron has found a home with pearl jam. <br /> <br />guy smiley signing off...
B0007OY2MG|5.0|I think that every Gilmore fan should own this complete set....i have the first three seasons and IM patiently waiting for season 4.  This show is so addicting and i abslolutley love it!  I get so caught up in the town of  stars hollow and wish i could just visit once.  I think it would be cool to get a virtual tour of the town like someone else said.  This show is one of the best I've ever see.  The actors, and writers go above and beyond what most shows try to achieve.  The fast paced caffeine addicted gilmore girls will always be there for me when I need to escape my life.
B00009Z576|5.0|Talking about the DRAMA album is talking about a group trying to survive (!?), to maintain their achived golden status; but for good, Chris Squire was always there...looking for the best musicians to fit in the band: That was the case of Rick Wakeman first (check it out in YESYEARS DVD), then there were White, Patrick Moraz, Buggles, Trevor Rabin, and the others... Everytime YES had domestic problems, those were a \\"familiar drama\\" inside the band, leaving Squire to clean up the mess (The inner photo slevee of the album said everything). So DRAMA neither is the the kind of record that can be a logical follow up to TORMATO nor the logical antecesor to 90125. DRAMA was DRAMA: A unique outstanding achivement (I gave it, without a doubt, 5 Stars) between the dense complicated textures of the old days and the commercial success of 90125. DRAMA was a Progressive Hard Rock oriented effort with some punkish gimmicks, more modern refreshed keyboard textures and (an almost as high as Anderson voice) a Trevor Horn vocal lines with a lot of sonic elegance, identity and presence. The changes were at the music level of Anderson & Wakeman. It was like the launch of a new Progressive band but knowing that in spite of all; Squire, Howe and White were there and this lead us to the question: Who has the mental \\"picture\\", the musical concept (style) of YES?...Obvious, the answer is....<br /><br />The coments for the bonus tracks are:<br /><br />1.  Into The Lens (I am a Camera):  Single edited version.<br /><br />2.  Run Through The Light: Single edited version.<br /><br />3.  Have We Really Got To Go Through This (Without lyrics): A<br /><br />  polished studio version of a song that was played with<br /><br />  lyrics at The sold out concerts in the Madison Square<br /><br />  Garden (listen YES: The Age of Buggles U.S.A. 1980).<br /><br />4.  Song No. 4 (Satellite): A raw version of a<br /><br />  musical idea with some interesting changes that they had in<br /><br />  mind at the moment somewhere in time at the studio (Great!).<br /><br />5.  Tempus Fugit (Tracking Session):  An interesting rehearsal<br /><br />  moment in the compositional fase of this track with still<br /><br />  missing lyrics but with the melody sang by Trevor Horn<br /><br />  (Quite Interesting!).<br /><br />6.  White Car (Tracking Session):  Again, an interesting<br /><br />  rehearsal moment of a song that sounds like \\"another song\\"<br /><br />  cause keyboard arrangements and the more acompased time<br /><br />  signature (SUPERB!).<br /><br />7.  Dancing Through The Light:  A Techno version of the track<br /><br />  with the same name (an experiment?).<br /><br />8.  Golden Age, In The Tower & Friend Of A Friend:  Songs<br /><br />  recorded at the TORMATO sessions, and maybe the cause of<br /><br />  the Anderson's departure: While Squire, Howe and White<br /><br />  wanted the music with a more Hard Rock edge, Anderson was<br /><br />  just writing songs like \\"Circus Of Heaven\\"; and Wakeman<br /><br />  wasn't happy with all the TORMATO results. Something was<br /><br />  missing again...(check it out in YESYEARS DVD).<br /><br />The interesting thing for all about this, is that at the TORMATO album were the seeds for another 3 albums: \\"Some Are<br /><br />Born\\" appeared at the second solo album of Anderson. The<br /><br />introduction of \\"High\\" ended in the instrumental song \\"Sketches In The Sun\\" of the first and only GTR album. And \\"Everybody's Song\\" was the early raw version of \\"Does It Really Happen\\" (sang by Anderson!) for the fantastic DRAMA record...Good Luck!udio (Great!). <br />5.  Tempus Fugit (Tracking Session):  An interesting rehearsal <br />    moment in the compositional fase of this track with still <br />    missing lyrics but with the melody sang by Trevor Horn <br />   (Quite Interesting!). <br />6.  White Car (Tracking Session):  Again, an interesting <br />    rehearsal moment of a song that sounds like \\"another song\\" <br />    cause keyboard arrangements and the more acompased time <br />    signature (SUPERB!). <br />7.  Dancing Through The Light:  A Techno version of the track <br />    with the same name (an experiment?).  <br />8.  Golden Age, In The Tower & Friend Of A Friend:  Songs <br />    recorded at the TORMATO sessions, and maybe the cause of <br />    the Anderson's departure: While Squire, Howe and White <br />    wanted the music with a more Hard Rock edge, Anderson was <br />    just writing songs like \\"Circus Of Heaven\\"; and Wakeman <br />    wasn't happy with all the TORMATO results. Something was <br />    missing again...(check it out in YESYEARS DVD). <br /> <br />The interesting thing for all about this, is that at the TORMATO album were the seeds for another 3 albums: \\"Some Are <br />Born\\" appeared at the second solo album of Anderson. The <br />introduction of \\"High\\" ended in the instrumental song \\"Sketches In The Sun\\" of the first and only GTR album. And \\"Everybody's Song\\" was the early raw version of \\"Does It Really Happen\\" (sang by Anderson!) for the fantastic DRAMA record...Good Luck! <br /> <br />
B00006CXXU|3.0|This cd in my opinion is a great transition for Christina.  She had released albums before this one that just bombed out.  In a way she is just showing her true image and is first between the poppish singers to brake away from that image.  This is definately a more deep felt cd for an older christina.  The songs are for everyone and move away from the innocence of wat the music industry plays on with young singers.  This cd was surprisingly good, and no matter wat criticism it gets Christina is definately one of the best singers out there and this cd shows it and expands on it.
0790731452|4.0|First off, I understand that a movie review is subjective.  This is just my opinion.  If you disagree, more power to you.  Roger Ebert called Gene Siskel a no talent hack on several occasions when their opinions were at odds.  For heavens sake!  It's just a movie. Tastes vary.<br /><br />So anyway, I love this movie.  It's technically very well done from the computer generated Martians to the battle scenes.  It has a ton of big name stars and the performances are pretty good.  It takes a quirky, satirical shot at those awful alien invasion movies of the 50s.  And it gores a lot of sacred cows, like liberals who expect an alien race to share their belief system ... The military mind who's solution is nuke first and ask questions later ... A president who's decisions are based on how they'll play on TV ... The lawyer who thinks even Martians can be bought ... The trailer trash family who see their humanitarian son as a failure ... The TV news reporter who's hair style is the most important part of any story ... and, well, I could go on but you get the picture.<br /><br />And to top it off, the Martians are defeated in a more believable way that those of Independence Day:  A software virus written by one man in a few days to infect a computer of alien technology?!!  Give me a break!  Earth was pretty lucky that aliens program in C and port to RS-232.<br /><br />Mars Attacks is a guilty pleasure I'm not even guilty about.
B00004T9UF|4.0|This cd is of course very controversial.  If your a huge EMinem fan then this is the cd TO HAVE.  If you hate Eminem(which i cant understand y)  and his harsh lyrics which is only him being brutally honest on what he feels then DONT BUY THIS CD.  <br />This cd contains songs in which EMinem trashes many ppl but of course that is him, and in a way these songs are enjoyable and we become infactuated with it. But on this cd are so many other songs tat show such a greater side of who Eminem is. This cd closes with a song in which Eminem says  <br />A lot of people ask me.. stupid f***** questions <br />A lot of people think that.. what I say on records <br />or what I talk about on a record, that I actually do in real life <br />or that I believe in it <br />Or if I say that, I wanna kill somebody, that..  <br />I'm actually gonna do it <br />or that I believe in it <br />Well, s***.. if you believe that <br />then I'll kill you <br />You know why? <br />Cuz I'm a <br /> <br />CRIMINAL <br />----------------This song to me was definately a great song to close with. It just shows tat Eminem is just making a living trying to just make ends meat.  Just because he says something doesnt mean thats what he does or wat he's going to do.  Music is just a matter of free speech.  THIS IS DEFINATELY THE CD FOR EMINEM FANS. <br />

B000006OBQ|5.0|I've always joked with people that, because of my taste in classic movies and music, I was born in the wrong generation. Frank Sinatra: Live at the Sands is one of the reasons I always say this. What entertainer today could muster such energy and emotion to transfix an audience? Singers today, and I use the word lightly, seem to focus to much on showing off there range instead of putting there own emotions into songs to sound original. Because of what Sinatra put into a song, the way he not only sang the lyrics but FELT them, he could never be copied or replaced. This concert at the Sands shows why he will always have one of the most individual, timeless voices that ever existed.
B0007M22TI|5.0|The women of Celtic Woman are fabulous. Their voices brought me to tears, especially Lisa Kelly. And, David Downes is brilliant.
B000001DVD|5.0|Def Leppard released their second album High 'N' Dry in 1981. Under the wing of producer Mutt Lange, who was riding high with the success of albums with AC/DC and Foreigner, the band sharpened their songwriting skills while maintaining their metallic crunch. As a result, the band would earn their first minor hit single here with \\"Bringin' On The Heartbreak\\" and would build tons of momentum toward their worldwide breaktrough with their next album Pyromania.<br /><br />All of the tracks here are very good and are harder and heavier overall than those on Pyromania. Joe Elliott's voice was still pretty rough, sounding similar to AC/DC's Brian Johnson, but still fit in well with the band's compositions. Tracks such as \\"Let It Go\\", \\"Another Hit and Run\\", and the title track are great songs with killer riffs mixed with strong melodies and memorable choruses. Other tracks such as \\"You Got Me Runnin'\\" and \\"Lady Strange\\" are very catchy and point toward the direction they'd pursue on Pyromania and Hysteria. \\"Bringin' On The Heartbreak\\" is an awesome power ballad, one that retains its emotion without becoming sappy, and leads into the killer instrumental \\"Switch 525.\\" Other strong tracks include the moody \\"Mirror Mirror (Look Into My Eyes)\\" and the fury of \\"On Through The Night\\" and \\"No No No.\\" All told, a great heavy metal album what would point their way toward superstar status. Highly recommended.
B0008KLVG4|5.0|I saw Jaws for the first time when I was seven years old, scared me and the whole water thing was kind of a big thing for the next two years or so.  With a movie that brings out true emotion with you and especially what it's aiming for you know it has done its job.  Now whatever is on the DVD relax, there will be newer things, it will once again be restored.  This is the 30th anniversary of one of the greatest films of all time, by perhaps the greatest director of all time. The DVD itself, if you negatively look upon it as stubborn as some of you are, this has nothing to do with Spielberg, Universal threw it together.  Be happy it's the 30th anniversary, look back and remember why you love it so... <br /> <br /> Max Einhorn  <br />\\"Maximum Movies\\" <br />Film Journalist of the Press and Journal
B000001EKX|4.0|Hotter Than Hell is the second album in Kiss' tremendous catalog of music. This was released in 1974 when they were still a struggling band hungry for success. This would actually be the second of three strong studio albums they'd release in a 13-month period which is even more amazing considering they were also touring heavily during this period. While not containing as many classics as their debut or having a timeless anthem like \\"Rock And Roll All Nite\\" from Dressed to Kill, Hotter Than Hell is a very good album despite its muddy production.<br /><br />There are no weak tracks here and a few songs still appear in their live show. Tracks like \\"Watchin' You\\", \\"Parasite\\", \\"Goin' Blind\\", and \\"Comin' Home\\" are among their best tracks with \\"Watchin' You\\" in particular being part of their live set off and on for the last 30 years. \\"Parasite\\" was co-written by Stanley and Ace Frehley and features one of their more memorable heavy riffs. \\"Goin' Blind\\" features one of Gene's most melodic bass lines while \\"Comin' Home\\" is a great track about being on the road. Both tracks would reach a whole new audience over 20 years with their inclusion on the MTV Unplugged album. \\"Hotter Than Hell\\" is a good rock anthem, something they'd master in the near future with the aforementioned \\"Rock And Roll All Nite\\" and \\"Shout It Out Loud.\\" Other strong tracks here include Frehley's \\"Strange Ways\\", one of the heaviest of their early tracks, Simmons' \\"Let Me Go, Rock And Roll\\", an ode to '50's rock, and the anthem \\"Got To Choose.\\" The remaining tracks \\"All The Way\\" and \\"Mainline\\" are decent as well. The second of six straight strong studio albums, Hotter Than Hell is an essential purchase for all Kiss fans.
B00080ZG1A|2.0|i had to see this film since Howard Hughes is one of the Most compelling people to ever grace the planet. also I was thinking last year with other Bio Films out how this one stands:with Leonardo DiCaprio as a Actor He is so-so to me at best.I've liked certain films he was in but i can take or leave him.the bottom line is that while he did a pretty good job as Howard Hughes,dude wasn't touching what Jamie Foxx did as Ray Charles period. some of the problems i had with this film was that sotry lines didn't get enough time to better get a grasp of all the things going on with Howard.Martin Scorsese is one of the Greatest Creative Minds in Hollywood,but He has to stop trying to re-create the 1-2 punch of what he had/Has with Robett Deniro with Leonardo Dicaprio. it's not the same magic.Scorsese  is playing hip to finally get that long overdue Oscar which he should have about 3-5 of them by now easily,but this ain't that good to merit that.I'd give this film a 2&half if i could.if this film was edited down&cut about a Hour then I'd say a high 3&Half stars.
B0006SSOHC|2.0|This film is far from being one of the scariest movies (ever).   Whether you do not care about the plot and acting and you just want to enjoy, take it. However, if you want to see a good made Horror movie, I'm afraid Saw's not for you. The acting is bad (That Adam guy - God bless him, I laughed my head off every time he opened his mouth), the plot doesn't make sense and there's nothing psychological in it or whatsover. It's here where Saw fails and makes you laugh insted of being scared. It's not that is a horrible movie, but watching it, you just don't care much. Well, I didn't anyway. The story wasn't shown in a credible way so you could have the chance to sympathize with the characters.
B00097DX3U|2.0|I've been listening to this cd on repeat most of the day, in hopes it would be one of those classics that grows on you. It's not. <br /> <br />I won't get overly detailed on the individual tracks. It has a couple (maybe 4, or 5 if you want to stretch it) of good songs with some catchy riffing, and the occasional mind-skewering Morello solo, but it's a bit weak overall. <br /> <br />The new single \\"Be Yourself\\" is terrible. Don't even compare it to \\"I am the Highway.\\" <br /> <br />Don't expect the same semi-Rage stylings from their debut cd. I don't know if Cornell was very involved in the music writing, but  if I had to guess, he wasn't. This cd just does not live up to any of my expectations, so save your money.
B0007GAEW6|5.0|This is not a review, it is information about the very confusing tracklisting on \\"Frances the Mute\\" <br />On the back of the cd, the tracks are listed this way: <br />CYGNUS...VISMUND CYGNUS <br />1 a. Sarcophagi <br />2 b. Umbilical Syllables <br />3 c. Facilis Descenus Averni <br />4 d. Con Safo <br />5 THE WIDOW <br />6 L'VIA L'VIAQUEZ <br />MIRANDA THAT GHOST... <br />7 a. Vade Mecum <br />8 b.

Faminepulse <br />14 d. Multiple Spouse Wounds <br />15 e. Sarcophagi <br /> <br />-That is very misleading.  <br />\\"Frances the Mute\\" was supposed to be a five track record, but then it would count as an EP, and they would have gotten less money for it, and it would have been unable to acheive gold or platinum status. Therefore, Cedrix Bixler Zavala and Omar a Rodriguez-Lopez, decided to split the last number - Cassandra Geminni into eight tracks. <br /> <br />So, the cd was meant to be heard this way: <br />1 Cygnus...Vismund Cygnus <br />2 The Widow <br />3 L'Via L'Viaquez <br />4 Miranda That Ghost Just Isn't Holy Anymore <br />5 Cassandra Geminni I <br />6 Cassandra Geminni II <br />7 Cassandra Geminni III <br />8 Cassandra Geminni IV <br />9 Cassandra Geminni V <br />10 Cassandra Geminni VI <br />11 Cassandra Geminni VII <br />12 Cassandra Geminni VIII <br /> <br />And remember: Humans are nothing more than animals.  <br />
B0009KA7BS|5.0|I don't see how people can be so hard on this, sure Keanu isnt an amazing actor, but I think he actually did pretty well. I think this is better than most other comic book movies [spiderman 1 & 2, league of extraordinary gentleman, Hellboy, Hulk, etc.] Sure its not as devoted to being like the comics as Sin City[which is frame for frame straight out of the comic] but I think it's better that way. Don't get me wrong, Hellblazer was a great comic, but I think the darker version of John Constantine is more entertaining. I geuss I only have two problems with this: <br /> <br />1. although this is a good adaptation, I wish they had kept more of the political and religous satire that made the comics so great. <br /> <br />2. They never really explained what that guy in Mexico was doing when he found the spear of destiny, that really bugged me. <br />other than that I really enjoyed this, and I think as long as you go in without expecting every line to pulled from one of the comics, you'll probably like it too.

B000000H6D|5.0|[NOTE: This text refers exclusively to the European edition of this album. I downloaded the songs, as it was a b***h trying to get it.]<br /><br />Prior to hearing this, I thought that October Rust was the ultimate Type O Negative recording. But after hearing this a few times, I guess it's safe to retract that opinion. Now, Type O Negative is my second favorite band (after Death [R.I.P. Chuck]). Vocalist/bass guitarist Peter Steele is my hero! His deep vocals alone are worth purchasing the album! Kenny Hicky has some great guitar riffs, Josh Silver's keyboard adds depth to the music, and there is great drumming curtousy of Sal Abuscrato (who left after this album to join Life of Agony, another great band, and was replaced by Johnny Kelly). This is my second favorite album of all time, right after 'Symbolic' by Death. And now for my favorite part of the reviews...<br /><br />1. Machine Screw - N/A All I can say is this: It starts out with a radio being turned with some \\"interesting\\" sound effects. >=P<br /><br />2. Christian Woman - 9/5 The first real song. I LOVE this track. I would buy this album for this song alone. How can you not love the lyric \\"Jesus Christ looks like me\\"?<br /><br />3. Black No. 1 - 8/5 Along with CW and Love You To Death, the first TON song I heard. The chorus is very catchy. Has aother memorable line: \\"Loving you was like loving the dead\\".<br /><br />4. Fay Wray, Come Out And Play - N/A The first of a series of interludes. It has the band members playing tribal drums saying a chant and has a woman screaming. Weird...<br /><br />5. Kill All The White People - 5/5 Why do I find this song funny? (I'm also white.) It has Pete screaming in the background with a German accent \\"Kill all the white people/Then we'll be free!\\". \\"Kill Them All!!!!\\" (Hello Metallica.) Very heavy, too.<br /><br />6. Summer Breeze - 5/5 Great song. Not much to say here.<br /><br />7. Set Me on Fire - 5/5 SB flows into this song. I also like this song very much.<br /><br />8. Dark Side Of The Womb - N/A Just babies crying over and industrial beat...next!<br /><br />9. We Hate Everyone - 999999999999999999999999999/5 My favorite song!

B000021XS0|5.0|This album is well... a musical experience. The instrumental proficiency displayed here is quite simply astounding. The album flows very well from one song to the next, as a concept album should. One thing I always like about Dream Theater is the variety of slower songs and harder songs on their albums, and this CD shows that with songs like Overture, Through Her Eyes, and Home. <br />  It's hard to pick any highlights since it really is meant to listen to all the way through, though Overture, Fatal Tragedy, and The Dance Of Eternity are particularly good. <br />  Definitely a album that will grow on you, and one of Dream Theater's best
B0007TKNL0|5.0|I did not get the chance to see the Sarah Brightman and Michael Crawford version, so I can not comment on which one was better. I loved this version though, the music, the plot, the acting, everything was \\"phantastic\\". Although if you don't like musicals don't even try watching this film most of it is sung. I loved the entire movie and I don't think one part of it was out-of-step or wrong. Although I have never been a big fan of Andrew Lloyd Webber I was surprisingly pleased with this movie.
0316666343|3.0|The story had a unique slant that rivited my attention through all its zillion pages.  I was so certain the murderer was going to come to a well-deserved end.  Wrong.  The ending she concocted for this vile human was about as meaningful as if he was run down by an average housewife eager to grab the best parking spot at the mall and knocked unnoticed into a drainage ditch.  I felt all my reading time was wasted. If she could spin all that malarkey about Ray and Susie having their moment at the end of the book, she could have come up with at least an average finish instead of this muck.  If the end only had the quality of the first portion of the book, I would have given it five stars.  I do think Ms. Sebold has great promise as a writer, but she needs to produce a complete quality product, not something else that is three quarters baked.
B000002H33|5.0|1. Battery- a Real Thrash Metal song with a short but very good solo much like Fuel's, great way to start off the album.(9/10) <br /> <br />2. Master of Puppets- Best Song on the album. Good lyrics and vocals it is about an addiction to Heroin and Cocaine. Clocks in at about 9 minutes with tons of tempo schanges, riffs, sweet and catchy choruses,and great solos by both james and kirk.  (10/10) <br /> <br />3. The Thing That Should Not Be- Every album has that song you dont want to listen to because you want to hear the ones after it.  Kind of Boring this song seperates Master of Puppetd from reign in Blood as best Metal album of not only 1986 but Ever, Reign In Blood by Slayer has no weak or boring songs. Even though Metallica is the best band ever and Slayer is a close second. (5/10) <br /> <br />4. Welcome Home (Sanitarium)- Metallica's best Power Ballad in my opinion but you can make an argument for One or Fade to Black.  Great Solo, and you would think by reading the lyrics that they were off of Load.  They do everything perfectly in this song...riffs, solos, Vocals, Lyrics, chorus. (10/10) <br /> <br />5. Disposible Heroes- Real fast and long song is only about 10-20 seconds shorter than Master of Puppets. Awesome Chorus but no real tempo changes and no real good solos, though it has great lyrics and riffs. (8/10) <br /> <br />6. Leper Messiah- Oh man this is a good song, it is a bit simplistic but i love that part close to the end(You'll Know what I mean when you listen to it).  Song has good lyrics and vocals.  It is about filthy-rich so called messiahs that make a profit off of Religion and God.  (10/10) <br /> <br />7. Orion (Instrumental)- A long Instrumental and a good answer to Ride the Lightning's \\"Call of Ktulu\\", as Call may have been a guitarists song, Anesthesia was a bassist's song, this was a probably a drummers song and though Lars isnt a great drummer this is his best effort along with Dyers Eve from the Justice album.  There is also a great basssolo by the late Ciff Burton(R.I.P.) and now then new bassist Rob Trujillo has made a new bass solo which is very good too. (9/10) <br /> <br />8. Damage Inc.- A real fast brutal song with a lot of bloody and violent lyrics.  theme song for the \\"Real pro Wrestling\\" show. Has a good guitar solo by Kirk and Cliff does a great bass intro.  (7/10) <br /> <br />This is the second best Metal Album of alltime(behind Slayer's reign In Blood) by the greatest band of all time. If you like \\"Ride the Lightning\\", \\"...And Justice for All\\", \\"Kill 'Em All\\", \\"St. Anger\\", and \\"Black Album\\" chances are you will love this album. I also Recommend Reign In Blood by Slayer. Reign In Blood and Master of Puppets were both released in 1986, many Metal fans call them the best albums of all time and still there is a big argument over which is better. <br /> <br />Pick Up Master of Puppets, you wont be dissapointed!!!
B000002KDO|5.0|Master of Reality (1971.), Black Sabbath's third studio album<br /><br />Black Sabbath in the early 1970's were a completely unique entity, as no-one sounded quite like them. Sadly, at first this meant that they gained little praise from the critics, even if they did gain quite a large following of fans. The band's first two albums were nothing short of excellent, with their second effort 'Paranoid' being a classic which is still hailed by many to this day. Eager fans in early 1971 were promised by lead-guitarist Toni Iommi himself that Black Sabbath's next release would be their heaviest and darkest yet. 'Master of Reality', Black Sabbath's third studio album, released in July 1971 was exactly what the band had promised; an album heavier, stronger and darker than any of their previous work.<br /><br />When I bought this album I wondered how the Ozzy-era Sabbath could ever top 'Paranoid', for the album was so good. However, 'Master of Reality' does exactly this and I personally think it is an even better album. Sadly, this album is a criminally underrated record, often overlooked in favour of its predecessor and the band's self-titled debut. The truth is though, that 'Master of Reality' has the best sense of completeness to it of the first three Black Sabbath albums. The songs are completely refined and any transitions within them are done perfectly. Furthermore, the album contains some of Ozzy Osbournes best vocal performances ever and some of Toni Iommis's heaviest, nastiest and most foreboding guitar playing is on the album. The album may well have the most uninspirational of all of Black Sabbath's album covers but don't let that put you off the album. The fact that five of the eight tracks on this album were covered on the 1994 Black Sabbath tribute album show how great this album is. 'Master of Reality' has also been one of the band's more influencial works, with tracks like 'Sweet Leaf' being a huge influence on 90's grunge bands, especially Soundgarden. The album itself has recently undergone a remaster. The album soundquality is now excellent but sadly no bonus tracks have been added to the release which would have been a great extra to pad out the CD.<br /><br />'Sweet Leaf' is one of the band's great opening tracks. From the coughing start, this powerful song about drugs has been a real influence for plenty of bands. 'After Forever' is typical Sabbath, this song being critical of religious beliefs in the lyrics. That aside it has some excellent guitar play and strong bass play from Geezer Butler.

B000002HMH|4.0|First off let me say this is no Master of Puppets or Ride the lightning nor is it a St. Anger, ...And Justice For All, or Kill 'Em All, and its not much like the Black Album.  It is in a league of it's own along with ReLoad. Load was released in 1996, while ReLoad was released in 1997.  This album features shorter more melodic and mature songs. The riffs are not very metal and there is no fast frantic classic Hetfield type singing you find in the other albums.  Though the lyrics are probably best on this album. <br /> <br />I will only review the first part of the album because I dont listen to the second half as it is quite weak. <br /> <br />1. Aint My Bitch- a faster Black Album style song that James wrote about an ex girlfriend. It's allright. (6.5/10) <br /> <br />2. 2x4- Kind of a weird song good lyrics bad solos. (6/10) <br /> <br />3. House That Jack Built- Great and I mean Great song. 6 minutes with outstanding lyrics and vocals. Kirk has a \\"talkbox\\" solo which is very unique and sounds pretty good. Very catchy chorus sounds great.   <br />\\"the higher you are <br />the farther you fall <br />the longer the walk <br />the farther you crawl <br />My Body, My Temple <br />This Temple it tilts <br />Step into the house that Jack built\\" <br /> <br />great lyrics right there and they are sung so well by James. Second best song on Load. The song is about James' addiction to alcohol and probably specifically Jack daniels whiskey(house that jack built as in jack daniels.) (9/10) <br /> <br />4. Until It sleeps- Good song with a weird guitar song but great lyrics and great vocals. With a catchy chorus it demands attention which is why it is a very frequent radio song. The lyrics are very depressing and sad and are about one of James' parents dying of cancer.(8/10) <br /> <br />5. King Nothing- catchy Radio song, nice solos and good vocals. You probanly have heard this on your local rock station.(8/10)  <br /> <br />6. Hero of the Day- My personal favorite song on Load. Real catchy, and has great lyrics with some real nice guitars in there.  The song has to do with Children these days who look to tv and media for idols, heros and role models when there are ones living with them at home(their parents)(10/10) <br /> <br />7. Bleeding Me- Real long song, a bit more heavy with real complex guitars and lyrics.  I still have no idea what it is about but good song none the less. (8/10) <br /> <br />Buy this Album for Hero of the Day, The House that Jack Built, Until It Sleeps, and Beeding Me. And hey you may like the second half of the album. I wouldnt say this is better than 80's metallica but it is better than Reload and possibly St. Anger(very Underrated). Although I really hate ReLoad(only good song is Fuel). <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
B0007Z4S4C|4.0|Mighty Rearranger (2005.), Robert Plant's eighth studio album<br /><br />Who said rock stars lose their greatness when they get old? This is certainly not the case with Robert Plant. His new 2005 release with his backing band 'The Strange Sensation' is a fantastic album. More importantly, this is one of Plant's finest post-Led Zep releases and one of the most diverse albums of the year. Robert Plant, one of the great voices of rock, may be 56 but his musical ability has by no means diminished and he can still rock with the best.<br /><br />I eagerly picked up this new album soon after its release, as being a big time Led Zep fan, any of the band members post-Zep releases attact my attention. I must say that I was far more than just satisfied with this album, its a great work and is definitely one of the stronger albums of the year. Robert Plant and his excellent backing band, the Strange Sensation (who are John Baggott (keyboards), Clive Dreamer (Drums), Justin Adams (Guitar), Skin Tyson (guitar) and Billy Fuller (bass)) in many ways put most current music to shame. 'Mighty Rearranger' is a multi-dimensional album which has never a dull moment and deserves all of the good praise it has gained from the critics/reviewers. Robert Plant's voice is still excellent, even if, in my opinion, it is no-way as strong and commanding as it was during the Led Zep years, but then, the man is much older now. The album actually has plenty of moments were the music sounds very Zeppelinesque, even though Plant would be the last to admit it as he dislikes talking about his years in the band (I can't understand why??). As well as some frequent Zeppelin-like guitar work, the album uses Eastern and African styles in some of the tracks as well as even some more jazzy moments. The album's cover is also one of the most unusual that I have seen but it gives a great impression of the worldwide styles used in the album.<br /><br />The album opens with 'Another Tribe' and has a powerful drum opening and develops into a great, almost war-dance like song. 'Shine It All Around' is the commercial release of the album but it is an excellent song. The song has a real contemporary feel to it in a good way. Plant sings the chorus brilliantly. 'Freedom' is very Led Zep sounding with its guitar lines but it is also quite a short catchy track. 'Tin Pan Valley' is a more mellow, thoughtful song with lots of whispering vocals from Plant before a surprise screaming chorus. 'All The Kings Horses' is a nice acoustic track and 'The Enchanter' is another strong track with an eastern/blues mix to it. The next song, 'Takamba' has an eastern sound which blends in with another Led Zep-like riff. The Indian sound continues with 'Dancing in Heaven' and 'Somebody Knocking'. 'Let the Flour Winds Blow' is one of my favourites, using some bluesy style guitar work over some powerful lyrics from Plant. The title track though, 'Mighty Rearranger', for me is the strongest track on the album. Plant saves his best vocal performance for this one. The jazzy piano fusion with some rocking guitar play makes this one a killer and we see the return of the HARMONICA, a great instument so overlooked in music in the past few years. 'Brother Ray' is a strange but interesting 1 minute track which is a bit jazzy. Leave the last song running though because it runs into the hidden track, a techno version of 'Shine it all Around'.<br /><br />Overall, 'Mighty Rearranger' is an excellent release from Robert Plant. This is one of his most powerful solo records to date and perhaps his most Led Zeppelin-like, which is no bad thing at all. If you want some great current music from an old rocker who knows how to do music at its best, get Plant's 'Mighty Rearranger'. The Mojo Magazine summed the album up well, 'All Killer ... No Filler!'a great, almost war-dance like song. 'Shine It All Around' is the commercial release of the album but it is an excellent song. The song has a real contemporary feel to it in a good way.

This is my favorite SO far out of all the books. It is the story of four children named Peter, Susan, Edmund and Lucy whom go through a magical wardrobe to a land called Narnia. They meet lots of \\"creatures\\" in Narnia such as Tumnus the faun, Mr. and Mrs. Beaver, The robin, The terrible white witch whom casts a spell over Narnia so the land is always winter but never christmas. And of course they meet the great lion Aslan! I encourage everyone to read this book and all the other Narnia books!
B000005RFJ|5.0|Master of Reality (1971.), Black Sabbath's third studio album<br /><br />Black Sabbath in the early 1970's were a completely unique entity, as no-one sounded quite like them. Sadly, at first this meant that they gained little praise from the critics, even if they did gain quite a large following of fans. The band's first two albums were nothing short of excellent, with their second effort 'Paranoid' being a classic which is still hailed by many to this day. Eager fans in early 1971 were promised by lead-guitarist Toni Iommi himself that Black Sabbath's next release would be their heaviest and darkest yet. 'Master of Reality', Black Sabbath's third studio album, released in July 1971 was exactly what the band had promised; an album heavier, stronger and darker than any of their previous work.<br /><br />When I bought this album I wondered how the Ozzy-era Sabbath could ever top 'Paranoid', for the album was so good. However, 'Master of Reality' does exactly this and I personally think it is an even better album. Sadly, this album is a criminally underrated record, often overlooked in favour of its predecessor and the band's self-titled debut. The truth is though, that 'Master of Reality' has the best sense of completeness to it of the first three Black Sabbath albums. The songs are completely refined and any transitions within them are done perfectly. Furthermore, the album contains some of Ozzy Osbournes best vocal performances ever and some of Toni Iommis's heaviest, nastiest and most foreboding guitar playing is on the album. The album may well have the most uninspirational of all of Black Sabbath's album covers but don't let that put you off the album. The fact that five of the eight tracks on this album were covered on the 1994 Black Sabbath tribute album show how great this album is. 'Master of Reality' has also been one of the band's more influencial works, with tracks like 'Sweet Leaf' being a huge influence on 90's grunge bands, especially Soundgarden. The album itself has recently undergone a remaster. The album soundquality is now excellent but sadly no bonus tracks have been added to the release which would have been a great extra to pad out the CD.<br /><br />'Sweet Leaf' is one of the band's great opening tracks. From the coughing start, this powerful song about drugs has been a real influence for plenty of bands. 'After Forever' is typical Sabbath, this song being critical of religious beliefs in the lyrics. That aside it has some excellent guitar play and strong bass play from Geezer Butler. 'Embryo' is a short instrumental which paves the way for one of the band's most revered tracks in 'Children of the Grave'. I think at the time, there will have been no song as heavy as this one, its a classic - the whispering, spooky finish is great as well. What was side 2 of the album, begins with 'Orchid', another good instrumental, this one being acoustic. 'Lord of this World' is another strong heavy tune but is then contrasted by 'Solitude'. This is the quiet, melancholy track on the album but it is also one of the best tracks on the album too.

B00092ZMDY|5.0|I was confined in the hospital for Diabetes Type 2 when the Farewell Tour came to Tokyo. Me and my wife already had the tickets before I checked in the hospital. When my doctor made his rounds 2 days before the concert, I told him about my disappointment of not being able to go. Guess what? He told me it's good for my health to go. So, he gave me a one day pass. When I got back to the hospital, I got 6 of the Eagles' Complete Greatest Hits to give away to the nurses. In that ward, I was the patient-who-went-to-the-Eagles-concert, and they all came to ask me how it was. What else can I say? I already gave it five stars!

B000007492|4.0|The Very Best of Volume 1 and 2 are not chronologically sequential.  Volume 2 which came out later is a suppliment to volume 1.  Between the two you get the bulk of certain albums.<br />To begin with neither album features anything from the groups largely ignored first two albums, Supertramp 1970 and Indelibly Stamped 1971.<br />Volume 1 features six of the eight songs on Crime of the Century 1974 while a seventh appears on Volume 2.  The only thing not featured is 'Asylum'. [7/8]<br />Only one song from Crisis? What Crisis? 1975 was put on volume 1.  Volume 2 meanwhile has two tracks of the ten songs on the album.  A cassette version of volume 1 also included Sister Moonshine, but this is not on either CD.  Despite only featuring three songs, Crisis is still as good an album as the other heavilly featured ones of this decade.  Aside from 'Sister', the other major overlooked track is 'Another Man's Woman'. [3/10]<br />Even in the Quietest Moments 1977 is represent by two tracks on Vol 1 and four on volume, leaving only 'Lover Boy' of the seven tracks excluded. [6/7]<br />Of the 10 tracks on Breakfast in America 1979 four are featured on volume 1 and another three on volume two.  Of the leftovers the greatest omission is 'Child of Vision' - which is unfortunate. [7/10]<br />Volume 1 featured only one track out of the nine from Famous Last Words 1982.  Volume 2, meanwhile features three.  Of the remaining five, the main one that sticks out as being overlooked is 'Crazy'.

This is not a particularly great album, though 'Still in Love' would have been a good addition. [1/6]<br />Likewise, only volume 2 features a track from the medicore Free As a Bird 1987 (which was also on the tape version of Volume 1).

B00005JNBQ|5.0|This movie is pure genius.  Taking someone who has no personality and making a side-splitting movie about them?  It's one of my all-time favorites!
B00006RU5B|5.0|This album is simply one of the best to come out in 2000's. The singles on this are \\"Cochise\\", \\"Like A Stone\\" and \\"I am the Highway.\\" The first 8 tracks of this are great and amazing with everyone one of them having ther own unique sound. After track 8 it just seems to become so mediocre. It is so much better to have Chris Cornell singing with Tom Morello's guitar's then having RATM's lead singer. SG and RATM are a great combination and even there second album is great. With Chris they easily surpass RATM's music.
1881273156|5.0|You will never know how much you don't know about your partner, friend, or family member until you read this book.  I read this book when I was married.  Yes, the marriage broke up, but it lasted as long as it did, due in part to the principals of this book.  I currently use the conceptsand awareness that this book has given me, to understand my relationships of all kinds.<br /><br />It is a fact, that becomes aparent after reading this book, that different individuals show and understand love in different ways.  I was always irritated that my ex-husband always wanted me to sit with him, hold his hand, hug him and cuddle with him while he was watching television.  I personally have little time for television, and I thought it was a waste of time.  In fact, I was insulted that he was not paying attention to me, but to the television.  Then I read the book and discovered that his love language is physical touch (not sexual) and mine is quality time.  So, I would sit next to him and read a book while he watched television.  And in exchange, we would plan a \\"date night\\" every week or so for me to get my quality time.<br /><br />I recommend this book for EVERYONE!
084428596X|5.0|This is the best short reference book on verbs and grammer I have ever found. Longer works usually leave the beginning student confused or frustrated when trying to find a grammer rule or even a simple verb with the bssic tenses. It is an excellent quick reference for someone attempting to learn Norwegian or someone wanting to brush up on the Norwegian they had learned many years before. This book combined with a beginning instructional work and Haugen's dictionary is all a beginner needs. Those wanting detailed lists of verbs should look elsewhere. <br />Even though I have family from (and in) Norway and spent my early years in North Dakota, I was encourged to speak only English. It has been decades since I have heard much beyond a few sentences in Norwegian even from my Aunts and Uncles that were born in Norway. This book was very helpful in giving me a quick overview of basic verb tenses and grammer. I can go on to more detailed works as needed, but would still use this book as a basic reference. <br />To the author I say: tusen takk.

However, I kept thinking about the book and what I had read intrigued me, so much that I went out and picked it up. I'm so glad I did. It was a very telling story of a young girl who is murdered. Although it is a very sad story, Alice Sebold is a great author. I couldn't find enough time in the day to finish it and I tried. Once I had some quiet time, I couldn't put the book down. I was disappointed to find out that the killer basically got away with it. I wanted it to have revenge, justice or something to \\"sock it\\" to the killer...but none of that happened. All in all, it was a great read.
B000268QB2|4.0|For years, I have been under the impression that artists have lost the art of making albums that are engaging right from the beginning to the end. This art is conspicously absent in albums of the new millenium. Keane appears to have mastered this lost art on their album \\"Hopes and Fears\\".<br /><br />  \\"Hopes and Fears\\" is a fabulous collection of 11 rich and melodic tracks that are well orchestrated and uplifting. At times, I feel like this is the album Tears for Fears should have made when they reunited last year. The songs are upbeat and the sounds of the piano add a musically ornamental effect to the each of the tracks.<br /><br />  This album is the effort of a band that has a promising and long future ahead of them. I just hope they do not become victims of poor promotion in the United States - something that most artists have been plagued with since the downfall of MTV in the 90s.<br /><br />  I look forward to hearing more from this band. That being said, the standout tracks on the album are \\"Everybody's changing\\", \\"Somewhere only we know\\", \\"Sunshine\\" and \\"Your Eyes Open\\".

There's something about the material from the likes of Ralf Hutter, Wolfgang Flur, Karl Bartos, and Florian Schneider that I like.  It's the fact that I'm into electronic music (mostly EDM like trance and house).  Just ask my friends.  I thought this album would be interesting when I thought about buying it.  It turned out to be one fine album I must say.  I wonder what people thought about these tunes back in the early 1980s.  They must've been years ahead of time back then.  I was alive no earlier than 1984, so I'm not exactly sure.  Still, this is a terrific album.    There are seven tracks in this CD.  Track one is the song \\"Computer World\\" (5:06).  Even now (2005), this song sounds pretty much ahead of time.  There are three vocalists in this track.  One's a normal human voice while the other vocals are two different robotic voices.  After that, there's \\"Pocket Calculator\\" (4:55), my favorite track.  I've been frequently saying the lyrics to this song lately. \\"I'm the operator with my pocket calculator.\\"  \\"I am adding, and subtracting.  I'm controlling, and composing.\\"  I like the part where he says \\"By pressing down a special key, it plays a little melody.\\" and then there's these random beeps.  I wish math class were that fun.  \\"Numbers\\" (3:19) is track three.  In this track, there are different robotic voices saying numbers in various languages, English, French, Spanish, German, Japanese, Italian, it's crazy.  There's also a drum machine playing.  But that's about it.  The music keeps going through the beginning of track four, \\"Computer World 2\\" (3:23).  The robotic voices from \\"Numbers\\" continue to say different numbers through \\"CW2.\\"  Track five, \\"Computer Love,\\" is the longest track in the album (7:16).  It's also the most emotional sounding.  After all, it's called \\"Computer Love.\\"  Track six, \\"Home Computer,\\" isthe second longest (6:19).  \\"Home Computer\\" sounds a lot like laboratory music.  Now this is weird, yet cool music.  This I like.  \\"It's More Fun to Compute\\" (4:14) is the last track on the CD.  This tune sounds like something heard in a sci-fi action cartoon.  A robotic voice says \\"It's more fun to compute.\\" in the song.  What the voice is saying must be true because sometimes computers can get things done faster than humans.  Isn't it better to get stuff done more quickly?  Overall, these are all good tracks.    Before listening to this CD, I didn't know what to expect.  After that, this turned out to be a fun album.  I find this music very enjoyable.  Kudos to Kraftwerk.
B0002234LS|4.0|Mort Rainey (Johnny Depp) has had it rough. He's a writer with a terrible case of writer's block. On top of that, it's been six months since his divorce, and he still can't get over it. Enter John Shooter (John Turturro), a mysterious man from Mississippi who shows up at Rainey's cabin door one day. Shooter claims that Mort has stolen his story and begins threatening him and making demands. Rainey slowly realizes that this guy is very unstable and quite dangerous, especially after Shooter performs some shocking animal cruelty on Rainey's pooch. Things get increasingly worse, escalating into murder and madness. Can Rainey prove that he didn't steal this maniac's story? Well, it's just not that simple! There's more to this than your typical stalker / madman flick. As the tale unfolds, we get small clues as to what's really going on. SECRET WINDOW is a solid thriller with some nice twists and turns (in a \\"sixth sense\\" / \\"the others\\" sort of way). I found the whole thing both entertaining and creepy. Johnny Depp is great, proving once more that he can play any role he's given, no matter how strange. Cheers...
B00025ETIW|5.0|I wasnt sure about buying this one at first. After hearing Helena, and Ghost of you, it was confirmed that i needed to hear more from this band. The album is amazing. And i love the song &quot;hang em high&quot; at first i didnt because of the western music intro, but it gets better. I havent taken this one out of my cd player since buying it...totally worth it and im looking forward to a MCR dvd of all the awesome videos. LOVE IT!
B0000024JA|4.0|This is album ain't blackout but there is a lot of dope songs on this album. All hip-hop heads need to cop this one!
6305897786|2.0|Let me first start off by saying that this movie was a complete disappointment. I had seen about the first 35-45-mins or so a loong time ago and I loved what I saw. It was a little creepy, theyre was a mystery, rare books that contained a puzzle... my cup of tea. Well yesterday I finally saw the WHOLE movie. Again, the first part of the movie is intreaguing, creepy, and all that. But then I dont know, the movie begins to become way to predictable and you have most things figured out before Johnny Depp does. I had the whole main plot figured out and it was only the middle of the movie. Still, I expected for something more to happen since the movie started out so good... sadly nothing does and then when the ending finally comes, it is EXTREAMLY anti-climactic. Now I wasnt expecting a big special effect extravaganza or anything but at least some information or something. THe movie just ends. You can kind of guess what happens next but there are still MANY unanswered questions and no amount of information that the audiance is waiting for. It just stops. <br /> <br />It could have been a much better movie. It started out well... slides and then just drops off the edge of a cliff. I love mysteries, I love puzzles, detectives, books that have a history... this movie had alot of the right elements but ultimatly does not deliver. Oh well. Maybe the book is better.
B00097DX3U|4.0|Listening to \\"Out of Exile\\" gave me the same sensation I got in 1996 listening to \\"Down on the Upside\\" expecting another \\"Superunknown.\\"  It's Rock'n'Roll-Lite.  I agree with the previous reviewer that Morello's riffs are creative and technically superior, but they also get on ones nerves a little.  They are too far from the traditional and end up hindering the harmony of the songs.  Cornell's doesn't push his vocals to the same limit he did on their debut.  With all this said, this CD still manages to keep you humming all day after listening to it.
B000669GAI|5.0|Granted, I rate just about all of PJ's releases 5 stars and I'm a little biased, but I have to say that even the worst critic should have something good to say about this 2-CD compilation. It's got something for everyone! If you like the hard and fast PJ, listen to the \\"UP\\" CD. If you prefer the softer, mellower PJ, listen to the \\"Down\\" CD. In addition to all their classics, it also has \\"Breath\\" and \\"State Of Love And Trust\\", two songs previously available only on the \\"Singles\\" soundtrack. Even more, it features a new and instant classic from the Tim Burton film \\"Big Fish\\", entitled \\"Man Of The Hour\\". It's a real touching tune from the mellow side of PJ. Also, Brendan O' Brien remixed \\"Once\\", \\"Alive\\", and \\"Black\\", and the new remixes are excellent. So if you're a die-hard fan but can never decide which incredible album to listen to, you can give this compilation a listen and enjoy the band's wide variety of good, classic rock n' roll. OR, if you're new to the band, and just don't know where to start or you don't even know if you would like their music, this is an excellent place to find out. It's got all of their classics and will give you a real idea of what the band is about, as it's career started in '91 and rocked on up to '03 and beyond. My ONLY complaint is the booklet inside has NO history of the band to help educate the newcomer. It just has pictures, but aleast their good ones. It's interesting to look at the cover and see a '91 photo of the group and then look inside and see a '03 photo of the group in the same general positon. This is all in all, a GREAT place to continue for the die hard fan or a GREAT place to start for the newcomer. Either way, you can't go wrong. But then again, you can NEVER go wrong with a band as AWESOME as PEARL JAM!!
B000067CPX|5.0|By the Way soars as one of my favourite albums. RHCP manages to pull off yet another unique cd, balanced with the upbeat and funky ''This is the place'' and ''Throw away your television'', and the slower ''Venice Queen'', ''Dosed'' and ''I could die for you'' that add that melancolic, yet beautifull ring to the album. No need to say Flea's bass riffs are purely excellent, as he stands one of the best bassist of his generation. The guitar's harmonics and catchy rythms are great, though it's not the leading instrument, its takes you away with breathtaking solos. The instruments mix perfectly with Kiedis' melodic vocals, that support the strong lyrics. One of the best tracks on the album, Minor Thing, kicks off with a solid intro and almost rap-sung lyrics. Beautifull. The 16-track album is a masterpiece, a must-have in your RHCP collection.<br />Personal favourite: Can't Stop
B0009A1AS2|5.0|Wow, when i first listend to this album, it honestly became one of my favorites. The first two songs \\"Root Of All Evil\\" and \\"Answer Lies Within\\" just grab your attention, and as most people know the first song of the album is pretty much the song that tells you if you will hate or love the album. Every song on the new album is just amazing. If you are a fan of Dream Theater I am sure you will love this album, and even if you have never listend to Dream Theater beofre and this is your first Dream Theater cd you will not be disapointed.
B000002VC3|5.0|I heard Eye in the Sky on the radio a few days ago and i HAD to get this album. Alan Parson has such a great voice. The songs are beautiful and melodies are nothing short of genius. And when i read bad reviews about albums that are put on sale to support the artists, it gets me really pissed. If you dont know how to make a melody out of thin air, then dont talk trash about other people's music!! Believe me, it's HARD to make new melodies and write songs! If you dont like the music, then listen to something else. Or else, then the listeners decided for themselves!!
076781214X|4.0|Would you make different decisions in your life given the opportunity? This questions forms the basis of a very original screenplay, along with a good dose of touching and humorous nostalgia. Not sure why it was not a hit. But then again, good story does not usually equate to box office success!
B000001H03|5.0|The only three people I feel I can consistently trust with interpreting Mozart well are Charles Mackerras, Neville Marriner and Karl Bohm.  These three conductors have spent their lives studying the Mozartian style and successfully mix modern instrumentation with 18th century interpretation to create performances that are both authentic and sublime.  In the case of this recording, Bohm provides what I believe to be the most beautiful account of the clarinet concerto ever recorded on a modern clarinet.  Prinz and Bohm take leisurely tempos, allowing the listener to soak up the melodic lines and heavenly timbre of the clarinet without feeling rushed.    The flute concerto is equally good, Tripp providing a beautiful tone and a great first movement cadenza.  The bassoon concerto is very well played by Zeman but at times seems to be covered by the orchestra during some of the tuttis.    The digital remastering of the original recording is wonderful.  For those who care, there is no basso continuo on any of the recordings, (which was going out of style during the 18th century anyway).  Personally, I don't care for continuo on anyting past the Baroque era, but it is a matter of one's personal taste.    As if this recording needed more endorsement, it is upheld by the Penguin Guide and NPR's Ted Libby as one of the best renderings of these three works.  You really can't go wrong.
B0007YMUZW|5.0|Not that I am a fan of the term \\"alt-country\\" but I definitely a fan of that type of music ... Uncle Tupelo, the Bottle Rockets, Wilco, Ryan Adams, etc. \\"Cold Roses\\" comes down heavy on the country side, but I think it will withstand the test of time and ultimately be remembered alongside Wilco's \\"Being There\\" as the best alt-country has to offer.<br /><br />I don't know if Adams' girlfriend dumped him or his dog died or what, but many of the songs are filled with beautiful longing and aching loss. Just try and listen to a song like \\"How Do You Keep Love Alive\\" and not be moved. I particularly love the line \\"I would've held your mother's hand/ on the day you was born.\\"<br /><br />I don't mean to sound like this album is a big drag, either. It is balanced with more upbeat songs. Listen to \\"Cherry Lane\\" and \\"Life Is Beautiful\\" to see what I mean.<br /><br />People always note how much of a vocal chameleon Adams is, and this album is no different. I picked up shades of early Springsteen, Hank Williams ... even Gram Parsons. The only annoyance, really, is that you have to switch between the two disks (a great problem if it's your only one!). Looking back over the track list, I see seven great cuts -- Magnolia Mountain, Sweet Illusions, Mockingbird, How Do You Keep Love Alive, Easy Plateau, Let It Ride and Cold Roses. And the others I haven't mentioned are mostly solid, too. Give it a listen.
0385504209|4.0|\\"The Da Vinci Code\\" is a fast-paced page turner that is definitely worth reading.  Similar in style to \\"Angels & Demons\\", I much preferred this book because the ending was much more cohesive.  Overall the storyline was much tighter and a little less predictable than \\"Angels & Demons\\".<br /><br />Robert Landon is once again the hero of the book.  In this case he finds himself being questioned about a murder which has taken place at the Louvre, and quickly learns he is also the prime suspect.  He soon finds himself on a quest to find the Holy Grail.  Unlike \\"Angels & Demons\\", where the course of the investigation was apparent pretty much from the start of the book, \\"The Da Vinci Code\\" doesn't have such an obvious path, which makes it more interesting for the reader.  The character choices though, are fairly similar, which is one of the weaknesses of the book for those who have read Dan Brown's other books.<br /><br />The biggest weakness would be the faulty history which is used to construct the story.  It is true that one should not expect historical accuracy in a fiction book, however, at the same time other authors I have read have been more responsible by included a section at the end where they discuss what is true and what was altered in the interests of a better story.  Dan Brown not only doesn't do this, but instead strongly implies at the start of the book, that most of the basis for his story is true.  He states: \\"All descriptions of artwork, architecture, documents, and secret rituals in this novel are accurate\\", but unfortunately that statement is not correct.  Comments his characters make about the Dead Sea Scrolls, Da Vinci's art, and even some of the architecture are simply wrong or are misleading to say the least.  Many of the historical statements are also inaccurate, which is one of the primary causes of the controversy surrounding the book.<br /><br />Despite that rather big flaw, when taken as fiction this is a very enjoyable book, and if you enjoy thrillers and conspiracy books you will almost certainly like this too.ou enjoy thrillers and conspiracy books you will almost certainly like this too. <br />
B000089RVX|3.0|So the first real album from Evanescence to reach the UK.  Yaaay so I went and bought it almost wetting myself, loved and subsequently went to see them in concert.  And at said concert they played \\"Even in Death\\".  Hmm...doesn't seem to be on Fallen, in fact Ms. Lee introduced it as being an older song... <br />So after much hard searching I finally manages to track down copies of Origin (the American album released before Fallen) and SHOCK HORROR there were also 4 other EPs in the underground.  So after taking at least a year to track them all down and after spending hours upon hours of listening, I find that Fallen, whilst a very well produced, slick and modern album falls short of the previous genius of Evanescence.  the lyrics are still deep and meaningful, but gone and the heart-wrenching lyrics that plagued tracks such as October, Forgive Me and Listen to the Rain.  So my advice to buyers is thus: Yes, a very nice album, well produced, balanced with decent lyrical content (Hello, Tourniquet) and good riffage (Track 11: Whisper in particular), and by all means buy if you are new to Evanescence.  Hardcore fans will be slightly dissapointed.
B00063MBU8|1.0|It is really amazing that this album is successful.  No talent to make this album basically.  Please, please listen to real music instead of this trash.  I don't care if its Mozart or Guns n Roses, but please, anyone with a ounce of taste should find something else to listen to.
B00030590I|3.0|This is such an odd movie.  It is surreal.  Its greatest strength is its physical beauty, its use of color, its use of masses of uniformed men, the panoply of it all.<br /><br />Its greatest weakness for me was that it had me experiencing the agitation of its main characters.  That's never fun for me.  It is a bit emotionally draining.<br /><br />We have the convention of one individual outperforming thousands, the super-hero silliness.  But rather than criticize the unreality of it, we can only accept it as part of the surreal character of a film that is a beautiful poem to watch.<br /><br />The plot doesn't bear scrutiny.  It is a story of assassins whose target is an ambitious king of a region of China, intent on conquering the nation piece by piece in order to unify all of it.<br /><br />Do the assassins want revenge for the attack against their own region, or do they choose to sacrifice their own land in favor of unity?  Are they assassins or aren't they?<br /><br />Why stop at China?  Why not justify the conquest of the entire world in the name of unity?  Wouldn't this prevent future wars?<br /><br />No of course it wouldn't.  There would be the rebellions.  Unity works best when the defeated party has a change of heart and rejoins the nation, as happened in the USA.<br /><br />Human rights are more important than political unity, which can be either good or bad.  Do we unify the world in the name of Hitler?  Unity in itself is neither good nor bad, and accepting this truth weakens the argument of this movie.<br /><br />The plot is pretty weak, since it all boils down to whether the assassins want to kill or don't.  What kind of movie is that?  I want to kill you.  No, on second thought, maybe I don't.  I don't think it is much of a plot.<br /><br />The weakness of the plot and the agitation of the main characters influence me to knock the rating down to 3 stars, but the beauty of the movie prevents me from dropping any lower.
B00004XONN|5.0|Awesome, at first i didnt get into this album but then when u lie down and close your eyes its takes you on a journey. I wont rate the songs individually because i see the album as one continuous song. Just dont judge the album by on the first listen. Also dont think of it as music as most of it isnt, just open your mind
B000002U82|5.0|Dark Side Of The Moon seems to offers sensational complexity, soothing colourful songs, compelling acid rock and dark, deep, well constructed meaningful songs with lyrical luminosity.<br /><br />Dark Side Of The Moon will be considered an outstanding achievement, placing a great deal of influence on the patterns and shapes of rock, as well as a superbly innovative accomplishment to be idolized by many musicians. The reason it accumulates so much praise is perhaps in its heroic creativity, lyrical beauty, and gorgeous rhythms. It opens with a mind yielding melody in Speak To Me/Breathe, a composition primarily beautiful through the soothing lyrical rhythms and comfortable music tones. On The Run heatedly expresses an escape attempt without the use of lyrics, and rather complex formities of sounds and vibes. Time is another soothing rhythm, incorporating more drums into its fluorescent sounds. The Great Gig In The Sky stresses more lyrics, still very light rather than being absorbed by the heavier sounds of rock n' roll that time surrounding it. However, it does feature a compelling guitar solo halfway through, unleashing more of an extreme rock sense into the song. Certainly a beautiful track. Reaching Money, we find a different phase of music, more rock based, and an obvious album highlight. Us And Them is another glorious song, much contributing to the exceptional succeedings of Dark Side Of The Moon. Brain Damage has rhythmic beauty to it, with a much different lyrical style as the key component in setting as different from any other song on the album. Ending with poetic brilliance, using the album title highly incorporated into the solo, Eclipse is more than necessary to create the acclaim that Dark Side Of The Moon managed to garnish.<br /><br />It is more than obvious that this album isn't for everyone, so, if you're familiar with Pink Floyd's works and enjoy their music, this album is a must buy. You shouldn't be wrongfully advised by those who lash out at Dark Side Of The Moon, referring to the poetry as an acid trip. It is hardly that, rather it is art. An extraordinary album, possibly the most original work ever recorded. Highly recommended to all music lovers of 60s rock and Floyd fans casual or diehard.at Dark Side Of The Moon, referring to the poetry as an acid trip. It is hardly that, rather it is art.

B0007Y08IS|5.0|I have mixed opinions on Trey Parker's movies. <br /> <br />I love Cannibal the Musical. <br /> <br />I thought the South Park movie was boring and tame compared to the TV show. I am already not much of a South Park fan (except for the hilarious Mr. Hanky The Christmas Poo episode) but the movie didn't go very far into outrageousness as the TV show did. <br /> <br />Orgazmo is a film I could take or leave.  <br /> <br />Baseketball was just plain awful. <br /> <br />Trey Parker was funny in the uneven Tales From the Crapper (A Troma not Trey Parker film). <br /> <br />I didn't know what to expect with this but it is now by far my favorite Trey Parker related film. <br /> <br />When this film came out, I heard an interview on the Drudge Report and learned that Trey Parker and Matt Stone are extreme conservatives, as I am also. They said they most agreed with the Libertarian party which I do as well. <br /> <br />My assumptions before then were that Parker and Stone were probably liberals and that a film on the war on terror would be from that perspective. Luckily, my assumptions were wrong. <br /> <br />This movie really appeals to me for the fact that the villains in this film are the Socialist Hollywood Leftists (who are being used by North Korean Leader Kim Jong Il). It is great seeing the Michael Moore puppet holding hot dogs in both his hands and mustard stains on his shirt presented as a suicide bomber against America.  <br /> <br />The only criticism I have of this Unrated DVD is the additional puppet sex scenes not in the theaters. In this version not only do the puppets have all kinds of sexual acts and positions but they also urinate and defecate on each other. I am all for pushing the limits to extremes on unrated director's cuts but in my opinion, it was out of character for the two Team America members that had fallen in love. If Parker and Stone really wanted to push bad taste by showing puppet scat sex, I feel they should have worked it in someplace else in an unrelated scene. Maybe by expanding the Michael Moore puppet's role a little? <br /> <br />The puppets are absolutely incredible looking as well as the sets. This movie is also a full blown action movie (seriously) and was designed in the same way as a full-blown action movie would be by Bill Pope who did the same for the (hugely overrated) Matrix movies. The only difference being the scale of the sets, \\"actors\\". etc. A lot about this and the main techniques are presented in the extra features of the DVD. <br /> <br />It is also full of Trey Parker songs which also even top those in Cannibal the Musical. We even have Kim Jong Il singing a sentimental song of how he is \\"ronery\\" (lonely). <br /> <br />I also thought the speech on the 3 types of people was exceptionally funny. You will need to watch to learn more about this. <br /> <br />Watch this movie. Great humor, songs, action, puppets. <br /> <br />If you hate the Socialist Hollywood Left, you will especially appreciate this movie! <br /> <br />
B000002H33|5.0|Truly a masterpiece.  Please give this a go, even if your not a big fan of 80's metal.  To all those other hundreds of fellow reviews who gave this a 5 star rating, let me just say you all have great taste, and are not blinded by some of todays pathetic excuses for music.
B00080ZG10|5.0|It's like a broken record.  Once again director Martin Scorsese is denied the Oscar by an inferior film.  What is it that the Academy has against Scorsese?  My theory is that he makes film's that are very personal to him that do not kowtow to the latest fashion or political correctness that prevails in Hollywood.  His only consolation is that his film's have a durability that the so-called winning film's lack.  \\"The Aviator\\" works not only as epic film-making but as an incisive biography.  The production values are stunning but they do not overwhelm the characters in the film.  This film captures the complexities that were Howard Hughes, a man so larger-than-life that if he didn't exist you would have to invent him.  The film conveys the inner workings of Hughes, the drive, ambition and, yes, the madness that threatened to overwhelm his dreams.  Scorsese was fortunate to have Leonardo DiCaprio portray Hughes.  Not since Robert DeNiro assayed Jake LaMotta in \\"Raging Bull\\" has there been an actor who immersed himself so thoroughly into a character.  Sorry Jamie Foxx, but DiCaprio gave the best performance by an actor last year.  Cate Blanchett, deserving of her Oscar, gives a multi-hued sympathetic turn as Katharine Hepburn.  I had always viewed Hepburn as something of a cold fish but this film was the impetus for me discovering some of her filmwork.  As always, Scorsese provides an interesting and informative commentary on the DVD.  He is abetted by his always engaging film editor Thelma Schoonmaker on the commentary track.  Scorsese has such an impressive resume of films that it is difficult at this time to see how \\"The Aviator\\" ranks.  That said, it is not a film I will easily forget.
B0002X314C|5.0|I first saw John Legend on a VH-1 Fundraiser concert a month or so ago and have heard \\"Ordinary People\\" on the radio and was captivated by the pure simple soul of his music.  This is one of my favorite CD's of all times and one of the few I can listen to straight through over and over again.  The only explicit lyric is the track with Snoop (I Can Change).  The words and music touch the soul.  Undescribably romantic and heartwarming but not sappy.  Words can't adequately describe the talent of this young man.  Love this masterful piece.
B0002DKCMG|2.0|This is about highschool grads who go to Europe to find a girl in Germany who whats-his-face has been talking to on the internet for a while and thought was a man, but finds out she was the babe of his dreams after she told him she wanted to come to the states to get to know him and he told her, think it was a guy to get lost.  <br /> <br />Well, I dunno why he wouldnt have used a voice on messenger or webcam, but i guess it's needed for the plot. So he realises shes a she and he wants her and she has blocked his e-mail. So instead of using as different e-mail to send to her to explain, him and his David Spade wanna-be friend go to Europe to find her.  <br /> <br />They meet up with some more friends and have a tough time going through Europe. The things they get up to. <br /> <br />Ups: The confession booth scene is funny.  <br /> <br />Downs: Bonus materials arnt worth looking at, the gag reel isnt funny, the deleted scenes where deleted for a good reason and the featurettes are average. <br /> <br />The movies OK, but nothing speciel. It really needed something that made it really stick out to have been really notable. Like the pie-scene of American Pie or the kissing scene of Not Another Teen Movie. But this movie is along the same lines of those kind of films. It does try to make a scene like those, but there just not so much funny as seen as trying too hard. <br /> <br />I dunno what the Unrated sticker on the cover is supposed to mean. I didnt see anything that I wouldnt just slap an R rating on. Unless it's the part where 200 naked men are running down the beach? <br /> <br />This comedy is ok for a rental. I dont think I wanna see it again soon. it's not original, youve seen this kinda thing before, but it's ok if ya got nothing better to watch. but dont get your hopes up, it's average.
B00080ZG10|4.0|The Movie <br />When you reach the level of a Martin Scorsese, you're like Mark McGwire; you better hit the ball out of the park every single time or you're letting someone down. So when the deservedly adored Mr. Scorsese delivered a bloop double with his Gangs of New York, the faithful were supportive -- but a little concerned. Where was that homer-smashing hero who gave us Raging Bull and Goodfellas? Sure, Gangs looked stunning and housed a handful of excellent performances, but let's be honest: there's no way it's bound to be remembered as one of the filmmaker's finest efforts. <br /> <br />Which is why I believe that Scorsese's follow-up project, The Aviator, was afforded just a bit too much of the effusive praise it received from virtually every corner of the globe. Yes, it's an extremely good film; heck, if Gangs was a bloop double, the The Aviator is a rocket-shot triple off the outfield fence. But it's just not excellent, and when you're talking about one of the planet's finest living filmmakers, \\"excellent\\" is what you've come to expect. And I can pinpoint the film's flaws to one distinct department: the editing. <br /> <br />That's not to imply that the phenomenally gifted editor Thelma Schoonmaker didn't do a fine job; she absolutely did, and apparently the Academy Awards voters felt the same way when they handed out their statues. It's simply that The Aviator starts out like a rocket ... and ends with a fizzle. Were this film directed by the Martin Scorsese of twenty years ago, an astute and hard-nosed producer would have taken Marty aside and said, \\"Wow, there's a great movie in this 170 minutes. Trim it down to 135 and you just might have a masterpiece.\\" But given Mr. Scorsese's reputation and status, there's not likely to be a producer who'd tell him what to do (Weinsteins notwithstanding). And that's just a little bit of a shame, because were it not for The Aviator's frequent lags in pacing it would, indeed, be a masterpiece. I'm not saying that \\"shorter is better\\" is always the way, but in the case of The Aviator, I believe Scorsese does himself a disservice by ambling away in the latter parts of the film when a more expedient approach would have been much more compelling. <br /> <br />That's it; that's really the only specific complaint I have regarding The Aviator: it wears out its welcome just when it should be clutching you by the collar. And that's the last time I'll mention it, because literally everything else about The Aviator is bathed in high-end cinematic quality of the most sterling degree. <br /> <br />The film tells the story of young Howard Hughes: aviation enthusiast, ladies' man, filmmaker, multi-millionaire, and eventual basket case in the clutches of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). The story opens in the mid-1920s, and an enthusiastic Mr. Hughes is hard at work on the most expensive movie ever made. \\"Hell's Angels\\" was a troubled production decades before anyone ever heard of movies called \\"Brazil\\" or \\"Ishtar.\\" After chopping miles of footage down into an actual movie, Hughes' war epic was met by critical acclaim and so-so box office receipts, and the young mogul quickly set his sights towards his alternate passion -- and that passion was airplanes. <br /> <br />Using mostly his own money, Hughes would design and build some of the most revolutionary airships ever seen at the time. He'd work alongside the U.S. government when a new style of spy plane was needed; Heck, the guy was so passionate about aircraft that he simply went and bought Trans-Continental Airlines (which he'd soon re-christen as TWA). Clearly this is a man who was a slave to his passions, and it's a good thing for Mr. Hughes that he was born into a family with such a hefty bankroll. <br /> <br />Known as a somewhat odd gentleman, Hughes was also infamous for his way with the ladies. Longtime love Katherine Hepburn was only one of the many Hollywood starlets who hung on Howard's arm at the hottest nightclubs and restaurants. But just as disillusionment often follows idealism, Hughes would soon find that the more powerful he became in the aviation industry, the more people there were who wanted to take him down. <br /> <br />All of it makes for perfect movie material, and Scorsese brings the Golden Age of Hollywood to life like few other filmmakers have ever done. Further, I'd happily go on record as saying that The Aviator boasts some of the most exciting aerial footage ever filmed. I couldn't care less about how many of The Aviator's airborne sequences were lensed practically and how much of the onscreen dazzlement is done through computers; all I know is that whenever there's an airplane onscreen in this film, you can get ready to see something pretty spectacular. <br /> <br />And this cast, wow. It's a safe assumption to say that just about any actor in Hollywood would swim through lava to work on a Martin Scorsese production; heck, just a cursory look through the cast list of The Aviator can tell you that. As Hughes, Leonardo DiCaprio delivers one of his very best performances to date. And this is a guy who did some truly superlative work in films like What's Eating Gilbert Grape and Catch Me If You Can -- so I do think it's safe to stop referring to the guy as a pretty boy with questionable acting skills. Frankly I've never understood that complaint; I think Leo's always been a damn good actor, and only five random minutes of The Aviator could capably support that opinion. Cate Blanchett took home a well-deserved Oscar for her addictively entertaining portrayal of Katherine Hepburn, while the background of The Aviator is absolutely swollen with stellar supporting performances; John C. Reilly, Alan Alda, Alec Baldwin, Jude Law, Ian Holm... Solid actors working at the very top of their game, and again, this is the kind of thing that happens when Martin Scorsese is involved. (Even the generally miscast Kate Beckinsale proves herself worthy of inclusion in this cast. She's astonishingly easy on the eyes, and she can actually act! Those who say through Van Helsing might be shocked to agree with me here.) <br /> <br />The Aviator is not a surface-deep Lifetime Channel-esque biopic in the vein of Ray or Veronica Guerin; Scorsese does not deify his subject or editorialize on why we should or should not admire the guy. But nor does the movie, despite its 170-minute running time, fill you with all the information you're hungering for. One would think that a nearly three-hour biographical epic could include at least a little snippet of the man's elder years -- but then that's me complaining about something that's not in the movie, when I really should stick to what is. (Plus that's clearly not the story that Mr. Scorsese wanted to tell, and who am I to tell him different?) <br /> <br />What is presented in The Aviator is more than entertaining and engrossing enough to keep you interested ... for at least 130 minutes or so. When you find that each successive Act III fade-out leaves you more than ready for the final credits, the film's power begins to diminish just a little bit. But hey, with this sort of beautiful production design, compelling dialogue, and pitch-perfect acting performances on display, one can forgive the movie for overstaying its welcome by a half hour or so. And it's most definitely a big step up from Gangs of New York, which means that Mr. Scorsese's next film should be staggeringly, outrageously, and stunningly great. (It's called The Departed, and it's a remake (of the Asian cop flick Infernal Affairs) which stars Leonardo DiCaprio, Matt Damon, Jack Nicholson, and Mark Wahlberg!) Can't wait. <br /> <br />The DVD <br /> <br />Video: A Widescreen Anamorphic (2.35:1) transfer that just leaps off your screen. Whether you're looking at huge, swooping airplanes, lush & luxurious penthouses, or the deep shocking blue of Kate Beckinsale's eyes, well, the flick looks just beautiful. <br /> <br />Audio: Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround, and you'll notice it most during the first-half aerial acrobatics. And I dare you to crank it up when Hughes crash-lands his plane into an apartment building. Also included is a French 2.0 track, as well as optional subtitles in English, French & Spanish. <br /> <br />Extras <br /> <br />Disc 1 offers an audio commentary with director Martin Scorsese, editor Thelma Schoonmaker, and producer Michael Mann. And as an admitted commentary junkie, allow me to offer the opinion that very few filmmakers know how to give good commentary like Martin Scorsese. His love for the cinema (not just his movie, but all movies) just leaks out of every piece of anecdote and insight. He's like that ultra-smart uncle who knows everything about movies, and his commentaries are just a delight for a movie geek like me. The editor and the producer share some insightful comments as well, combining for a nearly three-hour yak-track that's as enlightening as it is informative. There are a few dry spots, and the fact that none of the participants were recorded in the same room saps some of the track's potential spontaneity, but fans of the film will not be disappointed by the wealth of information offered here.. <br /> <br />Disc 2 is where you'll find the rest of the goodies, and the platter is fairly stocked with supplemental splendor. <br /> <br />Deleted Scene: Howard Tells Ava About His Car Accident - This is a clever little scene that got cut for no good reason that I can ascertain. Perhaps Mr. Scorsese didn't want his movie to go over the 170-minute mark. Heh. (1:38) <br /> <br />A Life Without Limits: The Making of The Aviator - Director Martin Scorsese, screenwriter John Logan, producer Graham King, and actors Leonardo DiCaprio, Alec Baldwin, Cate Blanchett, Kate Beckinsale, Gwen Stefani, John C. Reilly and Alan Alda all get their chance to throw some love and sunshine towards the film and its (justifiably) lauded director. But this featurette's mainly a surface-deep thank-a-thon with very little specific insight into The Aviator's production. (11:30) <br /> <br />The Role of Howard Hughes in Aviation History - Ron Kaplan (of the National Aviation Hall of Fame), aviation enthusiast Ralph Huddlestone, air racer Skip Holm, Hughes biographers George J. Marrett, Donald L. Barlett & James B. Steele, actor Leonardo DiCaprio, screenwriter John Logan, aviation Hall-of-Famer Robert Hoover give some of the real-life perspective on Howard Hughes. Sure, much of this material is stuff you'll find in the movie, but it's always cool to hear the authors and pilots bring the anecdotes back to historical fact. (14:35) <br /> <br />Modern Marvels: Howard Hughes - A History Channel Documentary - If you've ever seen any episodes from the History Channel's Modern Marvels series, you know you're in for a presentation as educational as it is entertaining. And such is clearly the case here. A brief search of the History Channel website indicates to me that this particular \\"episode\\" never aired on their channel, so I'm pretty impressed when I assume that the network produced this excellent mini-doco exclusively for the DVD. Either way, it's a fantastic inclusion to this 2-disc set. You get your Hollywood-ized story via the main feature, and a whole lot more of the factual nitty-gritty with this extremely well-constructed featurette. (42:07) <br /> <br />The Affliction of Howard Hughes: Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder - Leo D., OCD expert Dr. Jeffrey Schwartz, and biographers Donald L. Barlett & James B. Steele discuss the very real and exceedingly problematic malady known as Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder, and how it afflicted Mr. Hughes so terribly. Several \\"normal Joe\\" OCD sufferers are also on hand to share their experiences with the illness. Interesting stuff. (14:09) <br /> <br />OCD Panel Discussion with Leonardo DiCaprio, Martin Scorsese and Howard Hughes' Widow Terry Moore - Recorded at UCLA on December 2nd, 2004, this chat panel also includes Dr. Schwartz and Dr. Peter Whybrow as moderator. A few movie clips are interspersed throughout the talk, but it's mostly Leo explaining how he was able to replicate Mr. Hughes' OCD \\"tics\\" while Dr. Schwartz explains the disease in further detail. The audio is a bit tinny here (and there are no English subtitles for this featurette), but it's still compelling enough to warrant a look. (14:50) <br /> <br />An Evening with Leonardo DiCaprio and Alan Alda - David Schwartz (no relation to the doctor) moderates an entertaining Q&A session with Leo and Hawkeye. The back and forth gets a little dry here and there, but anyone who's ever experienced a post-screening Q&A at a film festival will find this featurette enjoyably familiar. (28:05) <br /> <br />The Visual Effects of The Aviator - Visual Effects Supervisor / Second Unit Director Robert Legato gives us the scoop on the film's rather impressive special effects. Some are big & flashy, others are surprisingly subtle, and most of them are covered in this slick little featurette. Particularly fantastic is the segment on how the Hell's Angels footage was reproduced. (11:58) <br /> <br />Constructing The Aviator: The Work of Dante Ferretti - Producer Graham King and production designer (extraordinaire) Dante Ferretti discuss the massive task of bringing Golden Age Hollywood to cinematic life. (5:58) <br /> <br />Costuming The Aviator: The Work of Sandy Powell - Considering the era and the characters found in The Aviator, costume designer Sandy Powell must have had a lot of fun going to work on this project. And what a lot of work it was! (3:34) <br /> <br />The Age of Glamour: The Hair and Makeup of The Aviator - Chief makeup artist Morag Ross and head hair stylist Kathryn Blondell share their experiences on (and affection for) this particular project. Given the these women (and their crews, of course) were asked to recreate the Golden Days of Hollywood Glamour, they clearly approached the movie with equal parts excitement and artistry. Take a few randomlooks at Blanchett, Beckinsale and/or Stefani for a quick glimpse at the painstaking efforts that went into this part of the production. (8:05) <br /> <br />Scoring The Aviator: The Work of Howard Shore - Composer Howard Shore touches upon how he created each of The Aviator's rather distinct musical themes. Based on how much research and attention to the screenplay that Shore devotes to each project, it's not at all surprising that he's quickly becoming the go-to guy for the finest directors. (7:10) <br /> <br />The Wainwright Family - Loudon, Rufus and Martha - Three members of the Wainwright family were on hand to portray lounge singers from the 1920s, 30s, and 40s. Join Loudon for a few tune-filled minutes as he explains his role in the film, and those of his children, Rufus & Martha. Slight, but still pretty cool. (5:02) <br /> <br />The Aviator Soundtrack Spot - An advertisement for the soundtrack CD. <br /> <br />Stills Gallery - A nice, long collection of production snapshots that skip on by without you having to click away all night on the \\"next\\" button. <br /> <br />Final Thoughts <br /> <br />The Aviator is like a huge, delicious pizza that's just way too big for its own good. You can stick the extra pizza slices in to the fridge for later consumption, but a movie should be enjoyed all in one sitting. I certainly don't think that I could locate the 25-30 minutes that could have been excised to make The Aviator a stronger experience, but I still believe that the movie runs on a lot longer than it effectively needs to. Your mileage may vary of course, and I still have no problem whatsoever in giving this movie and DVD our Highly Recommended designation. <br /> <br /> <br />
0767805712|5.0|This film is such a triumph.  In a world where people are being genetically altered as to be given the best possible start to their lives, Vincent (Ethan Hawke) is what is known as an \\"in-valid\\" someone who can't hold a prominent job in society unless they exist on what is known as \\"borrowed ladder\\" one of the social elite that has no use for their identity anymore.  In this movie, Vincent exists on a borrowed ladder to achieve his dream of getting into Gattaca and becoming an astraunaut, through Jerome and he appears to be doing very well until the director of missions is murdered. Vincent accidently leaves his \\"in-valid\\" DNA in the corridor and that leaves them to suspect that he killed the director. <br /> <br />What I loved about this movie though is its realism as to the future of DNA.  While doing research for a paper on forensic science I found that there are laws that investigators in Britain, Japan, and the Netherlands can use DNA technology to determine a person's ethnic mix and that scientists are extremely hopeful that DNA will one day allow them to get a profile of a suspect.  <br /> <br />If one watches closely in the scene where they find a match to invalid DNA, they bring up Vincent's picture, which provides them with a pictorial match to the suspect immediately.  Some geneticists have said that such technology like the ones used in Gattaca would be blurring the line between medical and science investigation.   <br /> <br />There is also some great symbolism in this movie as well.  For example, if you look at the name Jerome, and the word Genome, they rhyme.  Given that Jerome has perfect genes I do believe that this was intentional on the part of Andrew Nicolli, the director.  Also, in one scene you see Eugene pull himself a set of stairs that have a structure similar to the double-helix model.  Then there is the title itself, Gattaca is composed entirely of letters of bases found in a double-helix. <br /> <br />This movie is a great movie that touches the human spirit and shows what can happen even when the \\"ladder\\" is stacked against you.
0316776963|5.0|best comedic book ever written. Sedaris has the way with words. a total laugh out loud, wipe tears from your eyes memoir. a definite worth of $10 or however much you pay.  <br /> <br />a MUST BUY!
B00004Z459|1.0|This stuff SUCKS...it's really funny to laugh at how all you people can only say that it's \\"emotional\\" or \\"there is good rapping\\"....how about if there is actually \\"a good guitar solo\\" or mabye \\"NO rappin\\" <br />Go get some REAL rock <br /> <br />yo wats up dogg I'm a albino rapper
B00074CBIS|3.0|This comedy is about a rev head woman who gets mixed up with a cop whose a plain dork who cant drive. Together they work on stopping a couple of supermodels who are bank robbers.  <br /> <br />Comedy is ok in some parts, but couldve been alot better. <br /> <br />It doesnt make much sense to use a cab that convertes into a hot rod and is harldy used in the film that much. What was it supposed to be? James Bond gone taxi? <br /> <br />The bonus features are ok. The best is the Comedy Central interveiw, check that out, it's pretty funny! The movie has a few laughs, but nothing that sticks out. I wouldnt say there is anything special about this movie, but it's ok for a rental. It's better then I thought, but again, nothing speicel.
B0007VZ91C|5.0|Dakshina picks you up and carries you gently yet powerfully to deep inner realms...spiraling, spiraling down to a space of incredible relaxation, silence, and joy.   <br /> <br />It plays in my house for hours at a time, creating a lush refuge, and such an enticing invitation to return to the stillness pulsating at the center of all of our crazy cyclones. <br /> <br />If I had enough money, I would buy a copy for every political leader on the planet.  Om shanti, shanti, shanti....just imagine if you can... <br />
B0007TKNL0|5.0|I will not include what the movie is about but I will include my opinion of the movie. I'm 35 and my tastes in movies may differ from the younger generation.<br /><br /> Some people may say the play is better. But then you must realize the play is limited to singing and acting but lacks the magical aspect that is shown on the big screen. Modernized by the latest movie technology, this version is the best one yet. With stunning morphing scences at the beginning of the movie you will be hooked. In this movie the music is oprea style of course. But now it's mixed with rock which gives it a new aspect. With both Joel Schumacher and Andrew Lloyd Webber helping with the movie. I don't think anyone else could do a better job.<br /><br />-Side note- Now I was totally surprised on learning that Gerald Butler played as the Phantom. (From Laura Croft Cradle of Life.) And had no idea that he was able to sing. But I felt he did well as the phantom.<br /><br />I watched the version from 1991 with Burt Lancaster as the father (of the phantom) and theater owner. What I didn't like was the Phantom being fatally wounded by police.<br /><br />If you trully have a taste for all kinds of music. I trully hope you will enjoy this movie like I did. To me I think this movie surpassed all the movies I have ever seen including my favorites.
B000002KMY|5.0|I love this album, just like Heaven & Hell. The voice of Ronnie James Dio is so unbelieveble good. Definitely the best singer. All the songs on this album are great, except for 'Slippin Away', which is a bit boring, listenable, but boring. My favorite songs on thsi album are: 'Turn Up The Light' ,'Voodoo', 'The Sign Of the Southern cross', 'Country Girl' and 'Edge of the world'. So a lot of songs that are my favorite on this one. I just could not chose one of these songs as the best.     This album proves again that DIO IS MUCH BETTER THEN OSBOURNE. Also read DIO IS MUCH BETTER THEN OSBOURNE(part one), that one is about Heaven & Hell. So, let me give you some advice: Buy the Black Sabbath albums with DIO and DON'T buy the ones with Osbourne.
B000089RVX|5.0|ok when i first get a cd that i have never heard before, the first thing i do is listen to the entire thing and see if anything sticks out to me.  well, usually when i do this, theres only a couple songs i actually like.  but this cd was entirely diffirent!  every song appealed to me!  i have listened to this cd 10 times over(no joke) and i still am not tired of it!  but despite the amazing vocals, one of my favorite things about this cd is the feelings behind the lyrics.  this is almost the ONLY band i can find that does not revolve its music around sex and immoral things like rap musicians tend to do.  amy lee even expresses this feeling in the song \\"everybody's fool\\"   i say if u are a parent lookin for a good but clean cd for your child, this is it.  and if your jst lookin for some great music, buy this cd! its definitely worth it! i cannot express that enough! <br />
B000002UDD|5.0|I love this album... And no matter how much you try to convince me it's horrible, I'll love it even more. I don't usually like the excessive reverb on most 80's metal album but in this case it just adds to the nightmarish feel of the album. But if you really can't stand a rough production, then try the remix (but only if you REALLY can't stand poor production). It would be a shame that you overlook the classic tracks because of the production. <br />Moving on, the cover is one of my favourites, it freaks me out. Vic Rattlehead is one of the best mascots any band could come up with. <br /> <br />Next stop... RUST IN PEACE
B0002Y4T92|4.0|First the negatives. I read before I bought this that Clapton and Jeff Beck play with ZZ Top on La Grange, this is not true. Also, there is no footage of Beck at all. Was he even there? Also read John Mayer sat in with Clapton, BB, Vaughn and Guy. Maybe he did but there was no footage included here. Was waiting for Johnny Lang to rip into a solo, never happened. Eric Johnson was surprisingly sloppy at times. Of course his sloppy is still better than most guitarist. I really enjoyed Clapton playing with JJ Cale.  I thought that was great. Vince Gill put on a great set also. David Hildago was smoking, great vocals and guitar solos.  Clapton playing with Santana was interesting, although Clapton looked lost at times. I guess that will happen during a walk on. I have to say this was worth the money. I can't wait to watch it again.
B0001NBMBC|5.0|Wow, i was just blown away after listening to this album. <br />Poser bands like Nile, Suffocation, Morbid Angel, Hypocrisy, Death, Cannibal Corpse, Cryptopsy, and Slayer wish they were this good! <br /> <br />Slipknot is the best and heaviest metal band. <br />For other good metal listen to Korn and Limp Bizkit
B000002U82|1.0|This thing sold about 500 zillion copies, and yet it is absolutely boring, turgid stuff. \\"Money\\", the big radio hit from this, is a very dull bluesy song. The rest is sleep-inducing, pseudo-spacy, sound-effects laden rubbish. Yuck! It doesn't get more overrated than this.
B000063COX|5.0|...but I have the single. Great Track. Great Album. I prefer this to what they do now because it doesn't sound as dramatic and high quality (i.e. \\"Brave New World\\" + \\"Dance Of Death\\").  The only complaint I have about this re-release is the new CGI cover. What was wrong with Derek Riggs' masterpiece which was reduced to the CD label? Disgraceful...
B00008OLYN|4.0|It's pretty funny how the reviewer below broke the cd with his OWN BARE HANDS. I mean, man that just counts for sum'thn ya know. Oh man Opeth is too \\"intlectual\\" for ya? My good man, allow me to point you in the direction of Britney Spear's Greatest Hits! (My Prerogative). I trust that you will find it exactly to your liking :) <br /> <br />Now to the album itself. It's mainly a diversion from Opeth's other work. A great introduction to the bands softer side by people who haven't heard about them. However, I must say that it's the quickest to get monotonous and boring. Though it's a good cd, it's not in my list of recommendations. Here's much anticipation to their next album.
B000929AJQ|1.0|Trent has given the world 16 years of his terrible music. By now its just time to quit, the world doesn't need this nonsense anymore. <br /> <br />For truly talented music stick to Good Charlotte, 50 Cent, Britney Spears, Atreyu, Metallica (Load, reload, st anger) , and Any emo * nu metal band
B0007Y4TVU|5.0|If your die hard S.O.A.D. and you haven't still bought this album you should. If your not still you should sample this ablum. All of these disappoinmtent groups out their that they get loads of air time and play time on m.t.v. or v.h.1. This album will diffently prove the fact that S.O.A.D. will remain strong for many more years to come. Majority of the album is fast paced and like their debut album back in 1998. Also it's refrefshing because it sounds different from thier previuos ablums. Their isn't one bad track on this album.
0596009208|5.0|This is the number ONE Java book on the earth. I think it should be hardcover, not paperback, in order for long-term preservation.
B00008H2LB|2.0|This cd has plenty of catchy tracks, namely Somewhere I Belong and Numb to name two which have also got clips. <br />The rest of the other tracks kind of blur together. <br />Even the good tracks on this cd can't last repeated plays, after awhile one just finds them utterly predictable.  <br />I could care less if this band made bajillions, but at least they could make their later releases somewhat different. <br /> <br />The music aside, I recommend not reading this band's lyrics, which are utterly average and gives one a feeling that the band members perhaps hired angsty high school teens to write their lyrics for them
B000003C5C|1.0|First came thrash, which was trash. <br />now an even more proper name is Death. <br />Death is the death of metal. <br /> <br />Thanks... metal sucks now because of you. <br /> <br />For good metal, stick to Korn, Slipknot, and Atreyu.
B00007E8V4|1.0|I will say SOAD has a few good songs, but so does every other band. The problem is the anti-war, anti-american lyrics. I really don't know where they are from, but if they are from the USA they should know that war gives them the freedom to spout that garbage. If they are not then SHUT YOUR F**KING MOUTH. I would never buy their albums, but they must have a few like minded people to support their lacking efforts.
B00005K3OT|5.0|This 2000 fill is what is called a \\"feel good\\" movie.  It appeals to all ages, includes comedy, drama and romance and leaves you smiling when it's over. Not only that - it has a good story too.<br /><br />Set in a village in France, it's the story of a woman and her daughter who set up a chocolate shop.  The leading citizens of the town are horrified because not only does this woman not go to church, she also opens her shop right in the middle of Lent. The leading citizen of the town tries to show how immoral she is.  But, little by little, the woman worms her way into the hearts of the townspeople and not only wins them all over, she finds romance as well.<br /><br />Nominated for several academy awards, there are only good things to say about this film.  Jullette Binoche is cast as the chocolate shop woman and I adored her immediately.  Judi Dench is cast as her landlady who goes to the shop for comfort because her own daughter has turned against her.  Alfred Molina is the town leader and he sure is comical.  Johnny Depp is the romantic interest, a \\"river rat\\" who comes to the town to play music.  And in the end, everyone lives happily ever after.<br /><br />Even I, who usually prefer films on the dark side, was enchanted.<br /><br />Don't miss this film.  You'll love it.  Recommended.
B000002AS3|5.0|Whatever anybody has to say about this band there is no denying that this album is massive. It is amazing, start to finish. It kicked a hole in the music scene in the mid 90's and still sounds fantastic today.
B00070Q8DQ|5.0|As pathetic as I am, I've been a metalhead for five-some years, and only this year did I hear of a band called Behemoth. I thought I knew metal band...boy, was I sorely mistaken. To make matters even more embarrassing for me, I did some research and found out this band has been around for well over a decade.<br /><br />I was ready to give Six Feet Under the award for this year's best death metal album, but then I read an online review that made me want to run out and get some Behemoth. Now that I've heard \\"Demigod,\\" I can safely say it definitely takes the prize for 2005's best death metal album.<br />All of the necessary ingredients are here to make a perfect death metal album: Behemoth-sized (large, beast-like) riffs, searing guitar solos, monstrous vocals, and pounding drums.<br /><br />The beats would be only half-as brutal as they are without drummer Inferno`s driving machine gun attacks and Kirk Windstein's constant bellowing. Inferno's barely controlled drumming also helps the album to build and gain density like a skyscraper, and Kirk summons his inner demons, and makes every bellow from his gut, but he never sounds hoarse or tired. The end result is a huge sound with evil, dragon-like vocals. To better describe Behemoth's sound, think of Deicide's riffs and vocals put to Slayer's speed, and add Burn the Priest's constant double bass drumming.<br /><br />Highlights include:<br /><br />\\"Sculpting the Throne ov Seth\\" has an acoustic intro. This soft beginning abruptly changes when a pounding riff and fast double bass drumming make an appearance.<br />\\"Demigod\\" has some scorching riffs, but the pummeling drums are what dominate this song (the drums are as audible-maybe even a little more so-than the guitars.)<br />\\"The Nephilim Rising\\" has more loud, booming riffs and background drumming. An acoustic section follows the guitar solo, and ends this song.<br />\\"Towards Babylon\\"is an onslaught (one that is kind of surprising, considering the last song ended with an acoustic bit). It explodes out of the speakers with cannon-like machine gun drumming and guitars that hit equally as hard and simultaneously. This might be the heaviest song on the album, and another Morbid Angel-esque guitar solo is near the end.<br />\\"Slaves Shall Serve\\" begins with a capella vocals, but Kirk's voice is just as brutal here as it is when he is yelling over the instruments. Following this, there's a great give and take between the guitars and rapid fire drums. This song has a couple of half-second pauses, after which the song increases speed with more insane drumming.<br />Album closer, \\"The Reign ov Shemsu-Hor\\" begins slowly with a couple of riffs that are few and far between and some slow(er) drumming. Heavy chugging riffs eventually kick in and build off each other, and this song also ends with an acoustic outro.<br /><br />So, \\"Demigod\\" is definitely one of the best death metal albums I have heard in 2005. If you like heavy as f*** heavy metal, you can't go wrong with this. If you're a true metalhead, your collection needs some death metal, so you'll need to check out Behemoth. The bottom line is, if you don't like \\"Demigod,\\" you don't like good death metal.s with cannon-like machine gun drumming and guitars that hit equally as hard and simultaneously. This might be the heaviest song on the album, and another Morbid Angel-esque guitar solo is near the end.  \\"Slaves Shall Serve\\" begins with a capella vocals, but Kirk's voice is just as brutal here as it is when he is yelling over the instruments. Following this, there's a great give and take between the guitars and rapid fire drums. This song has a couple of half-second pauses, after which the song increases speed with more insane drumming.   Album closer, \\"The Reign ov Shemsu-Hor\\" begins slowly with a couple of riffs that are few and far between and some slow(er) drumming. Heavy chugging riffs eventually kick in and build off each other, and this song also ends with an acoustic outro.       So, \\"Demigod\\" is definitely one of the best death metal albums I have heard in 2005. If you like heavy as f*** heavy metal, you can't go wrong with this. If you're a true metalhead, your collection needs some death metal, so you'll need to check out Behemoth. The bottom line is, if you don't like \\"Demigod,\\" you don't like good death metal.
B0006IIKS0|4.0|This rock-u-mentary is a fly-on-the-wall view of arguably one of the most successful heavy metal bands in music history. After twenty-five years, Metallica have reached a serious creative impasse, and the band member's are not getting along, particularly Hetfield and Ulrich. To add insult to injury, their bass player has quit the group (or subtly pushed) and their long time producer, (Bob Rock) is sitting in as they slog away, creating the new album. Because nothing is working, the band hire a psychotherapist for $10,000 a week, to sort out the situation, which opens up a can of worms, emotionally and creatively, for all concerned. These group therapy sessions, for me, at least, was uncomfortable to watch, as they reveal the all-too-humanness of these icons of rock, all too often whining like spoiled children, not happy with their success. For the most part, I found these therapy sessions self-indulgent in the extreme. Ulrich had to be the most annoying, feeling so much \\"pain\\", selling his multi-million dollar art collection, and feeling a small sense of \\"relief\\", when the paintings sold for over thirty-four million. Give me a break.<br /><br />Hetfield came across as the member who seriously confronted his demons, admitting himself into re-hab for alcoholism and returning after six months a changed man, his creativity in tact.<br /><br />Ulrich, on the other hand, after a year of group therapy, didn't change in the slightest. After Hetfield returned from re-hab, Ulrich continued to play his ego games and constant nonsensical whining, only this time, Hetfield wouldn't respond to his childish rantings, thus progress was made on the record. Let's face it, Ulrich, although an excellent drummer, is not the heart of Metallica, Hetfield is Metallica, and without him, the band would fade into history. I sense Ulrich knows this, but cannot confront it, thus his over compensation towards Hetfield.<br /><br />Astonishingly, St Anger managed to get made, despite everything, and the record is one of their better endeavors in years.<br /><br />The most entertaining part of the film was the auditions for the new bass player. This young man has great style and plays from his guts, which suits Metallica's style as well. The million dollars they handed to him up front for joining the band, shows how much money this band is worth in the market place. Astounding.<br /><br />Some Kind of Monster is a true behind-the-scenes look into Metallica's creative process, their individual personalities and the dark side to ultimate success. Though self-indulgent to the point of irritation, the film manages to convey certain honesty, and that, in the end; it all comes down to the music.ng, and the record is one of their better endeavors in years. <br /> <br />The most entertaining part of the film was the auditions for the new bass player.

B0000640VO|5.0|This movie is about a girl named Amelie. Who in her own strange way tries to help her friends and some strangers find happiness. This movie you have to catch at the beginning or you will be totally confused. This movie is great it shows you that you can take fate into you own hands and not wait around for a miracle that may never come.
B000002C25|3.0|While this album tends to get mixed reviews, I do like it. It is not their best by far, but it does include some great songs like D'You Know What I Mean? and Stand By Me. I have to say, though, the songs go on for way too long and the production is horrible. Even Noel hates the production on this one. Most of the songs are 5 minutes and counting and they could easily be trimmed by a minute or two. The production is a mess. The album sounds like it was mixed underwater: everything is a jumbled mess. Anyway, it is not a horrible album and I love listening to it now and again.
6305897786|4.0|The first time I watched this movie, I was literally spellbound, unable to so much as glance away from the screen for a moment. The slow and insidious suggestion of evil that increases progressively throughout the film is much more terrifying than any gory modern horror fest or slasher flick could be.<br /><br />Shot in the style of the best Hitchcocks and reminiscent of Rosemary's Baby, this is one movie I don't suggest watching all alone late at night.
B00003CXS4|4.0|What an off the wall, strange thing this movie was!  A lot like Fight Club (which I'd rate with 5 stars) ... funny, low grade British comedy with an unusually good Brad Pitt -- and thank goodness his role is small!
B00006L9ZT|5.0|I bought this Ring for it's cast, and while some will recommend other singers for certain roles, the Met cast is largely solid.  Levine and the orchestra are in top form.  Yes, Behrens is not the best Brunnhilde available.  However, you should buy this Ring if you are looking for a traditional production with a great orchestra.  There are several other Rings available on DVD, but many steer far from what you might expect from Wagner.  If you own one Ring cycle on DVD, buy this Met production with Levine.
B000929AJQ|5.0|First, I have been a fan of NIN since its debut album back in 1991 when I was in high school. And I have followed this band all through college and grad school and I have to say that this is by and large their best effort since \\"Pretty Hate Machine\\"    I listened to entire album twice before writing this review and I have to say, I LOVE IT!     This is the album that should have followed \\"Pretty Hate Machine\\". PHM is by far NIN's best, but this comes a second close. Whereas \\"The Fragile\\" and the \\"Downward Spiral\\" and even the EP \\"Broken\\" were an exhausting orgy of noise and aural chaos, this album is well crafted and tight; it's hardcore yet melodic.     All the tracks are good, but the best are (in my opinion):    1) All the love in the world  3) The collector  4) The hand that feeds  5) Love is not enough  6) Every day is exactly the same  9) Getting smaller  13) Right where it belongs    Enjoy!
B0002DB52M|3.0|Some people absolutely rave about Dogville, while others pan it. Regardless of your ultimate feelings about it, it is worth viewing. It is an extremely unusual film, shot on a solid black soundstage with stark chalklines indicating the set and a bare minimum of props. At first, in this minimalist setting, the film feels like a rehersal for a play, rather than a movie. But Nicole Kidman, in yet another extraordinary role, slowly draws you in as the absolutely vulnerable Grace. Before your eyes, the small town and its inhabitants make a relentless and excruciating transformation from a group of well-meaning simple folk, to one of the most insidious and twisted group of individuals you could ever imagine. The absolute absence of frills makes this transformation that much more powerful, with nothing there to distract you from the sickening results of human nature at its worst. Yes, the visuals are stark, certainly the film is much too long, but in the end, it will leave you with something to think about. It may not become one of your favorite all time movies, but I bet it'll stay with you a lot longer than the last Hollywood blockbuster you saw.
B0002ZDVEU|4.0|Well, it was not as brilliant as the prequel but it's still a good action movie, at least much better than some freaks they make these days. the beginning of the movie was rather intriguing that made it seem boring from the begining but it was good at the rest. its better than an average movie but the DVD was great, full of special features, thanks to the studio. anyway, It's worth to be watched once and buying it for a DVD collection will not be a waste of money. after all, it's a great special edition DVD!
B00004Y6RO|5.0|You wake up straped by leather bounds to a bloody discetion table. You look up and see 9 masked men each armed with bloody discetion tools staring at you through their masks with looks of dispise in their flaming red eyes. <br /> <br />This Digi pack I think is the coolest thing Slipknot has ever came out with! It's the orginal first CD but with 6 [sic] songs added! <br /> <br />1) 74261700027 1/5 Its not a real song just an intro. <br /> <br />2) (sic) 3/5 Awesome way to start the CD its a good song. <br /> <br />3) Eyeless 5/5 One of the best songs on the CD. They got the term \\"you cant see California without Marlon Brando's eyes\\" from a mad man who would run around the streets in NYC screaming that. <br /> <br />4) Wait and Bleed 4/5 One of their most famous songs. <br /> <br />5) Surfacing 4/5 This song is like a timed bomb waiting to blow up the stupid teeny bopper MTV industry. <br /> <br />6) Spit it Out 5/5 Totally awesome song which is one of my most favorite ones. The vocalist Corey Taylor raps and adds a thrashy metal voice to it. <br /> <br />7) Tattered and Tworn 2/5 Nothing special about this song and I would say its the worst one the whole CD. <br /> <br />8) Me Inside 5/5 Great song Corey adds a bit of melody to it which makes it a whole lot better. <br /> <br />9) Liberate 4/5 This song is about someone closing themself off from the world because it's screwed up. <br /> <br />10) Prosthetics 4/5 This song is based off the 1965 movie called \\"The Collector\\" its about a man who kidnaps a woman and adds her to his \\"collection\\". <br /> <br />11) No Life 4/5 Not much to say about this one but I think its cool. <br /> <br />12) Diluted 4/5 Every CD has a sad song and on this CD this is that sad song. You can feel the pain Corey has been through, through the lyrics and aggression he uses in his powerful voice. <br /> <br />13) Only One 4/5 Good song but not much to say about it. <br /> <br />14) Sissors 5/5 Incredible song! Its about a man who cuts his heart open. For the last few mins. of the song Corey the vocalist goes off on a solo which sounds soooo cool! <br /> <br />15) Get This 4/5 This song is like a bottle rocket. From the moment its launched till the end its like one massive explosion. <br /> <br />16) Spit it Out (Hyper version) 5/5 An even more crazier and faster version of the orginal \\"Spit it Out\\". <br /> <br />17) Wait and Bleed (Terry Date Mix) 5/5 I really dont notice a difference between this one and the orginal. <br /> <br />18) Interloper (Demo) 5/5 Sweet hardcore song Corey goes aboslutly crazy on this one! <br /> <br />19) Despise (Demo) 3/5 A decent song but it soon evloves into the song \\"Purity\\" which is about a girl who gets buried alive by her crazy ex-boyfriend. <br /> <br />20) Surfacing (Live) 4/5 The band sounds even cooler when they're live!
6305127697|5.0|This is the film that had audiences and critics alike exclaiming \\"Who IS that kid?!?\\" Edward Norton, in his first big role, pulls off a brilliant performance that will leave first time viewers dazed. If you haven't already seen this, it is a must!
B0007OCG4W|3.0|Closer is a convoluted-yet-beautiful love story that is crippled by the impossiblity of the actors living up to the script's demands.  Immensely popular with both young and old crowds alike, mainly because it's... well, a convuluted-yet-beautiful love story.  One could compare it to Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind with its massive time-bends and jumps, but one would probably do better not to taint a movie with such incredible acting as Eternal Sunshine with the forced rigidity of this film's dialogue. <br /> <br />The writing is, in a word, breathtaking.  It is herein that the deficiency lies.  While watching scenes with Alice (Natalie Portman) and Dan (Jude Law), one's suspension of disbelief is so broken, it's as if one were watching their children perform in a play.  One is almost convinced that Jude Law is gay, as the only person he has perceivable chemistry with in this film is Larry (Clive Owen).  The writing is so dramatic and eloquent that it sounds forced coming from people in such situations as the characters, save one notable exception.     <br /> <br />The ultimate saving grace of the entire film is the incredible acting range of Clive Owen, and the chemistry he illicits from all the characters, save Jude Law, whose performance, truthfully, left something to be desired in all of his lines that did not involve him yelling for some reason.  Owen's Academy Award nomination was certainly warranted. <br /> <br />Natalie Portman delivers an extremely solid performance outside her work with Jude Law(which amounts to about 10 minutes of the movie), while most of her lines delivered at his side sound somewhat coaxed, yet more natural than most actresses her age.  I personally thought that while her character is an excellent portrayal of an excentric with a need for stability, the lines were perhaps fed to her a little too much; it's quite obvious she's not reading her own interpretation of what her character should say.  Hopefully future directors will giveher the freedom to improvise her character's dialogue. <br /> <br />I'm indifferent to Anna (Julia Roberts) in this film.  She proves nothing new, and delivers a fairly sturdy performance; her character isn't really a person so much as she is an object throughout the film, but she manages to personify that object very well. <br /> <br />There is a difference between stage acting and film acting.  No one really wants to admit it, but the script required a few more adjustments to suit the move from the stage to film.   <br /> <br />All in all, I cannot say that I do not adore this movie.  With some more realistic adaptations to the script, this film could have been perfect.  As it stands, the movie is still beautiful, through all the small imperfections.  A beautifully convoluted love story; a convolutedly beautiful love story, a smart, sexy drama; it's all of the above.  I have to recommend it to anyone with a heart that's ever been broken.
B00005A46T|4.0|Listining to this CD is like being hanged by a huge meat hook while crows peck out your eyes, demons pour rock salt on your open wounds, and maggots feeding off of your rotting flesh. Most people complain about Slipknot being such an angry band. Well in a since they have a right to be. They were all raised in the small deprived state of Iowa, some had abusive parents and Corey had a so called \\"Perfect\\" dad but he never got to meet. So basically these guys grew up thinking that people = sh*t because of all the stuff they've had to put up with. Parents dont let your kids listen to this CD and if they want to listen to Slipknot then buy them Volume 3: Subliminal Verses (which has no parental advisory sticker on it) Well heres my rating of all the songs on the CD: <br /> <br />1) [515] 2/5 This isn't really a song its just an intro to the song People = Sh*t. <br /> <br />2) People = Sh*t 5/5 This is a agressive song about the bands main views of the world and people in general. They consider people being equilivent to sh*t because we kill, we waste, and we pollute. Which I think is all somewhat true but people aren't that bad. <br /> <br />3) Disasterpiece 4/5 This song is real gorey espically the part when the vocalist Corey Taylor says \\"I wanna slit your throat and f*ck the wound\\". <br /> <br />4) My Plague 4/5 Its a decent song and was on the sound track to the first \\"Resindent Evil\\" movie. <br /> <br />5) Everything Ends 2/5 I have to say that this is the worst song on the CD there's nothing real special about the lyrics and the vocalist keeps repeating \\"this is the end of everything\\" <br /> <br />6) Heretic Anthem 1/5 This song is real hardcore but why I gave it a 1/5 is because I'm a Christan and this song goes against Christianity when the vocalist says \\"if you're 555 then I'm 666\\". <br /> <br />7) Gently 3/5 This song orginally came off of their first CD called MFKR but they revised it. Its a good song it starts off nice and soft then gets real hardcore. <br /><br />8) Left Behind 5/5 Great song! The lyrics are cool and in this one the whole band did a great job on making it. It also has a kick ass music video which can be found on their \\"Disasterpieces\\" DVD. <br /> <br />9) The Shape 5/5 This songs real cool the vocalist starts off in a calm but panicy voice then he unleshes his powerful screaming voice. <br /> <br />10) I Am Hated 3/5 There's nothing real special about this song but I thought it was odd how they refer to themselfs as the \\"anti cancer, the only answer\\" and \\"bipolar gods\\". <br /> <br />11) Skin Ticket 2/5 In this song the vocalist has a real morbid sounding voice and he keeps repeating \\"come see my cage built in my grave\\". <br /> <br />12) New Abortion 5/5 This song is about deprived maggots like me who live in a small low populated deprived state where there's nothing to do and how the older people always blames things on my generation. <br /> <br />13) Metabolic 5/5 (A.K.A Diluted part 2) This song is about how the vocalist Corey Taylor had a so called \\"perfect\\" dad he never got to meet. In the song he sings about how he tries to be like him but fails because he's not \\"perfect\\" then he refers to his life as \\"the ultimate irony\\" because he's tried so hard but has failed and \\"took a good life and made it all into a mockery\\". <br /> <br />14) Iowa 4/5 This one is a MAMMOTH of a song. Its 14 mineuts long and its mostly instrumental. The sampler Craig has added some real morbid sounds to this song which makes it even more creapy.
B0006HXXBA|5.0|The above tagline has been attached to recent works by bands such as Killswitch Engage, Atreyu, Trivium, etc., when it really deserves to go to Kreator's \\"Enemy of God\\".  After spending the last few years in an experimental phase, Kreator return with a brutal and crushing real thrash album that recalls the glory days of Slayer and Megadeth.  Kreator has never sounded better than they do here, with the songs themselves more complex in their structure and the lyrics providing actual insight instead of constant screaming.  The opening title track is an instant classic, while \\"World Anarchy\\", \\"Dystopia\\", \\"Voices of the Dead\\", and \\"Dying Race Apocalypse\\" are some of the best material this band has ever created.  Forget the pretenders flooding the metal market today, Kreator is the real deal, and \\"Enemy of God\\" is the true metal masterpiece of the new milennium.
B000929AJQ|3.0|I am a rock fan.  I LOVE NIN, System of a Down, etc.  But I have to say that this album truely disappointed me.  I was hoping for songs more like some on their old albums but they are very low key and not much heavy rock in them.  All the songs sound the same and it doesn't sound good at all.
B000929AJQ|5.0|I am somewhat confused as to how any real Nine Inch Nails fan would find this album anything less than brilliant. With this album I discovered a NIN that I never knew existed. Although I owned \\"The Downward Spiral\\" for some time, I didn't consider myself a fan - I thought the music was interesting but somewhat \\"messy\\" sounding.<br /><br />I don't recall what lead me to sample this album, but I found that every track on here sounded pretty good. I bought it and was not disappointed - I was in fact extremely pleasantly surprised. Trent cleans up nicely - and I don't mean his vices, but musically. I also read reviews comparing this to \\"Pretty Hate Machine\\" and it led me to get that album as well - which I loved. Now I consider myself a big fan. I find Trent's music intoxicating - haunting, melancholic, spiritual, ethereal, emotional, forceful, mysterious, angry, sad, hopeful, sensual and of course dark...and many more adjectives that I can't think of right now, complemented by the perfect voice and delivery. Plain and simple, I can FEEL him and his music. I also didn't realize that he was such a beat master. Some of those tunes have really funky bass lines and beats. The songs \\"Only\\" and \\"Sunspots\\" really caught me off guard - this is the Trent I never knew about and I love it.<br /><br />Now than I am discovering his past work, I am amazed that what has been considered Trent Reznor's best work for many years - The Downward Spiral - is really not typical and in my opinion, with the exception of a few songs, too noisy and out of focus. I am now listening to \\"The Fragile\\" and I am liking it a lot - way more than Spiral.<br /><br />If you've kinda liked NIN but were never convinced by the noise, I suggest you get \\"With Teeth\\". You will find a brilliant artist that has been hidden under a few commercially successful songs that don't accurately depict the complete body of work. Then I suggest you promptly get, \\"Pretty Hate Machine\\" and \\"The Fragile\\", in that order. If you fall in love (I did), go ahead and get \\"The Downward Spiral\\" and \\"Broken\\", but unless you are a completist, I would opt for downloading select songs from those albums, namely \\"Piggy\\", \\"Ruiner\\", the classic \\"Closer\\"; and \\"Suck\\" from Broken.<br /><br />I really don't know what there is to dislike about \\"With Teeth\\". This is truly an excellent album.If you fall in love (I did), go ahead and get \\"The Downward Spiral\\" and \\"Broken\\", but unless you are a completist, I would opt for downloading select songs from those albums, namely \\"Piggy\\", \\"Ruiner\\", the classic \\"Closer\\"; and \\"Suck\\" from Broken. <br /> <br />I really don't know what there is to dislike about \\"With Teeth\\".

B0000A4GAK|5.0|Unlike the more raucous Joyful Noise, Soul Serenade is silky smooth.  More jazz than blues, this is my favorite \\"kick back and relax\\" album.  There is just no way to feel tense when DT is laying down those honey smooth slide licks.  Each song on this album is distinctly different.  The only thread that ties them all together is Derek's slide guitar -- and that's not a bad thread at all.      Greg Allman makes a guest appearance on \\"Drown in My Own Tears\\" and delivers one of the absolute best vocal performances of his four decade career.  On \\"Sierra Leone,\\" Derek puts aside his electric Gibson SG for an acoustic guitar and delivers one of the most beautiful acoustic slide pieces I've ever heard.  The only thing wrong with this album is that \\"Sierra Leone\\" should last for about 30 minutes rather than less than 2.      It's hard to believe that DT was only around 20 years old when these tracks were recorded.  Only time will tell where he eventually falls in the pantheon of great blues guitarists, but he's certainly off to a great start.  His music has both a depth and width which belies his age and I'm looking forward to much more great music from the DTB in the future.
B0007QJ1MK|4.0|So far, this is probably my favorite album of 2005.  I first got into Queens of the Stone Age with Songs for the Deaf, which is one of the best hard rock albums of the past few years.  Of course, the biggest change since then has been departure of Nick Oliveri, which leaves Nick Homme as the sole center of the band.  By and large, he does a good job of keeping the flame, even if there's nothing on Lullabies to Paralyze that quite matches the blistering energy of \\"You Think I Ain't Worth a Dollar\\" or \\"Six Shooter.\\"  Instead, songs like \\"Tangled Up in Plaid\\" and \\"In My Head\\" take their cues from \\"No One Knows\\" and \\"Go With the Flow,\\" while Mark Lanegan contributes the haunting opener.  Homme is less successful when he tries to recapture some of the more manic material Oliveri was known for; \\"Burn the Witch\\" is excellent, but \\"Someone's in the Wolf\\" seems to run on too long and the two tracks that follow it aren't particularly memorable.  On the whole Homme's forays into pop (\\"I Never Came\\") and funk (\\"You've Got a Killer Scene\\") work very well, which should come as a relief to those concerned about the future of the Queens after Oliveri's departure.  Highly recommended.
B0000C6E4D|3.0|<br />I am not a big fant of Sarah McLachlan, but I happened to catch her version of Full of Grace one day and I really loved her voice. It was very sweet, soft and calm. So I decided to give this albumn a try. At first I was disappointed because I couldn't find anything outstanding with her songs. Nothing in particular catches my attention throughout the entire albumn. I could let this CD run on the background for hours without even noticing it because it just doesn't sparkle. All songs sound similar, soft, slow and calm.  <br /> <br />Now however, I've listened for the CD for two days now and some songs start to grow on me. So if you are looking for an albumn of catchy sing-along songs, this one is definitely not for you. But you are one of those people who can chew on the songs for a long time, I recommend this CD.  <br /> <br />I still enjoy Sarah Mclahlan's voice. It is very pleasant to listen to. But I just wish the songs could've been more upbeat and catchy.  <br /> <br />
B00097DX3U|3.0|I'd have to agree with G.D. Brennan's previous review and say this one's closer to 3.5.  It's certainly better than a lot of the trash out there today, but nothing about this album really grabs me after listening to it a few times.  Perhaps the best thing about Out of Exile is that the band's sound appears more organic and cohesive than it was on their self-titled debut, but this unity appears to come at the expense of the energy and experimentation that carried the previous album.  Nothing on here matches the primal roar of \\"Cochise,\\" while the first single \\"Be Yourself\\" seems to be a poor rehash of \\"Like a Stone.\\"  On the whole Out of Exile is much more subdued and restrained than the last album; songs like \\"Doesn't Remind Me\\" and \\"Dandelion\\" actually seems to take their cues from Chris Cornell's mellow solo album, Euphoria Morning, rather than the harsher edge of Soundgarden and Rage Against the Machine.  Even the bluesy songs, however, aren't as accomplished as \\"I am the Highway\\" or \\"Getaway Car\\" were from Audioslave's debut.  The guitar solos and sound effects that Tom Morello is well known for are also largely absent, with the result that nothing on Out of Exile is as sonically complex as \\"Shadow on the Sun\\" or \\"The Last Remaining Light.\\"  This is a stripped-down version of what we've seen before, and while it's a solid sophomore album and may be a good introduction for those new to Audioslave, Cornell, or RATM, I can't help but miss the intensity and energy that underscored their first release.
0062502182|3.0|The 3 stars are given for the author for trying. Overall, the concepts and ideas in this book are very attractive and interesting. I really respect the author for coming up with such an unique tale. However, maybe it is due to bad translation, but the writing is just so bland that I feel it is very hard to keep the reading going for more than 20 minutes each time. It almost feels as if the book is a collection of the best cliches. One thing that I feel the author neglected to emphasize is what are all these ideas and concepts mean outside of the story? How should we relate the \\"omens\\" and \\"Soul of the World\\" in real life? It leaves me a bit lost and confused. But then again, maybe that was the point.
0393312836|4.0|First off, for all those looking for a clearly stated rating, or opinion, this novel was enjoyable. The characters were a bit shallow, but I contribute this to Alex's narration--because he describes the events through his perspective, he, naturally, does not see the other character's depth/thoughts, etc. His own character began as a simple character as well, but he grew (subtle actions and words hinted at a depth). Anyways, the book is a violent one, not as terribly graphic or explicit as some have said, but nevertheless, violent. Not for the kids (the immature ones, at least). I have not seen the movie myself, but from what I have heard and read (I own a version of the novel that has an introduction by Blake Morrison which speaks of the movie), the movie is a great deal more violent and explicit (so much so othat Burgess himself found it gratuitous). So. Onto my review which will discuss the book's various themes and such.  <br /> <br />Anthony Burgess tries to convey several themes, particularly the maturation of youth, the importance of freewill, and the relationship of high art with refinement. Alex's character in the beginning of the novel was a petulant and selfish adolescent whose fun included rape and drugs. The government and society tried severely to discipline and control the wild youth. All of their attempts, including incarceration and post-corrective advisers, were in vain and Alex returned to his old ways. Despite Alex's troublemaking, he established early in the novel his desire to learn from his elders, \\"to slooshy what some of these starry decreps had to say about life and the world\\" (Lee, p.12). This shows that rebellious teen actually hears the preaching and \\"nagging\\" that is told to him by adults, and that there is hope that may reform.  <br /> <br />At the end of A Clockwork Orange (after the Ludovico technique and its failure), subtle changes had emerged in his character-he felt bored and hopeless and didn't participate as much in committing the actual violence. After some other changes, it is revealed that Alex keeps a photograph of a baby with him, now clearly showing his transformation. Then his meeting with Pete and Georgina show Alex that it was time to mature and leave his youth. **Nadsat (the slang terms he uses), I have found are used to represent the \\"wildness of youth\\". Note that Dim, who despite growing up (physically) continues to partake in violence as a police officer, and still uses nadsat. Vis-a-vis, Pete no longer does, and has in fact settled down and has become a father.** Alex had grown up, and in the process, fully left his violent ways. Youth is meant to be wild, admitting that Alex's youth is an exaggeration, and the only cure is age. In the words of Blake Morrison, \\"Youth...must have its fling, however wild.\\" <br /> <br />The second theme within A Clockwork Orange is the importance of freewill. The government and society attempted to solve the growing problem of teenager related crimes by suppressing their freewill (Ludovico's technique). This however, as shown in the book, was no solution. Alex (the technique's first subject) still had violent thoughts and wanted to do bad things, he just couldn't physically act out. So then, was he a good person? No. The actual act is not what makes something immoral, it is the intent (as with a young child who unknowingly injures someone). <br />Finally, often those who enjoy classical music, are affluent or are intellectual are thought to be better. There is a general notion that high art civilizes. However the men that ran Auschwitz read Shakespeare and appreciated Beethoven and Bach (A Clockwork Orange, introduction by Blake Morrison, xiii). There is a stereotype that enjoying the arts makes one better morally and socially, and as displayed in A Clockwork Orange, this is not true. <br />
0553208845|5.0|This is one of the best books I have read. I just finished reading this book for the second time, and discovered many new things that I had not considered or was not able to understand before. Herman Hesse was extremely interested in eastern religions and philosophy, and this book shows his profound understanding of the teachings of Buddhism and Hinduism. I don't think it's a coincidence that the two main characters of the book -- Siddhartha and Govinda -- are named after real life people (the actual name of \\"The Buddha\\" was Siddhartha Gotama, though in this book he is only referred to as Gotama; Govinda a contemporary of \\"The Buddha\\" was a follower of the Ajivikas -- a practice which is probably defunct now).<br /><br />Siddhartha is a fictional account of one man's quest for self knowledge and inner peace. Set about 2500 years ago in India (when the real Buddha was alive and preaching), the story chronicles the life of Siddhartha from his adolescence to old age. During the course of his life, he meets many teachers: the Samanas (ascetics who practiced extreme forms of self-denial and pain), a beautiful courtesan, a rich merchant, a ferryman, and the river. Though he learnt the most from the river, towards the end of the book, an old Siddhartha realizes that \\"every wind, every cloud, every bird, every beetle is equally divine and knows and can teach us as well as the esteemed river.\\"<br /><br />This is one book that I intend to read on a regular basis not only to learn from it, but also to see how changes in my own personal perspectives change my interpretation and understanding of the book.
0262731541|5.0|What can I say? This book is so packed with useful theoretical, historical and design-related information that I barely know where to begin. As one of the authors mentioned in his note below, the third edition of this book has been substantially revised and updated, and is hands-down THE best resource I have ever come across for the science behind bicycle design and operation. <br /> <br />The chapter on human power is especially enlightening, but, honestly, every fact, formula and suggestion in this book is enlightening. The authors should be commended for bringing such a useful book into existence; it is a great gift any time someone accepts the burden to gather, distill and distribute the kind of valuable technical information that is contained between the covers of this book. Bravo.
1878424319|4.0|The Four Agreements is a wonderful book that has been life-altering, as well as life-saving for me. This is truly a practical guide to personal freedom. And it CAN work in your life, even if you take baby steps, each one will bring you closer to happiness.<br /><br />The agreements begin with \\"Be Impeccable With Your Word\\". This goes for speaking your truth always. It's ironic how we go through life sometimes lying to ourselves and others. This means not hurting oneself in lieu of hurting another, this means speaking your mind when it really is your truth and loving oneself enough to know that your opinions, beliefs and self count enough. Such a simple thing as not telling an entire truth is also considered lying. It is far much easier and less stressful to be honest always.<br /><br />The second agreement is \\"Don't Take Anything Personally\\". Every one of us is living in our own world, with our own agenda. Sometimes we project onto others based on our moods, good or bad, or say things that we don't mean but are hurtful. If we do not take it personally, we don't make part of their \\"dream\\" our dream. Let it roll off. This is easier said than done but also another great healer. We are less concerned with what others do or say, we are still content with ourselves.<br /><br />The third agreement is \\"Don't Make Assumptions\\". It is far greater to find out what someone is thinking by asking. We often put ourselves through much drama but creating scenarios in our head about what another might be thinking. Far less energy is spent is we just ask. What the choose to tell us either way, will not matter if we adhere to agreement two; because we won't take it personally.<br /><br />The fourth agreement is \\"Always Do Your Best\\". What more can we ask our ourselves. If we are always honest, don't take anything too personal, ask questions when we are unsure and honor ourselves and others as best we know how, that is great! There are some days that will be more difficult than others but we can accept that as well. Every day is a new day.<br /><br />This book has been quite a blessing at a transitional point in my life and have found it helpful in understand myself and others in the grand scheme of life. You will learn how from childhood we live and learn by a \\"Book of Law\\" based on lessons learned from adults and other people. Things we are told become our reality and many of these things are negative, fear-based un-truths that we accept as truth. This book gives you practical lessons in breaking these laws we agree to govern our lives, so we can lead happier, healthier, more productive ones. Don Miguel Ruiz is truly a wonderful messenger. What an inspiring book!han others but we can accept that as well.

6305388458|5.0|Perhaps the greatest comedy film of all time.  <br /> <br />From start to finish The Holy Grail is full of classic comedy moments brilliant gags and incredible twists. <br /> <br />There is so many interesting points to write about this film, so here it goes!!!! <br /> <br />What's brilliant too is the fact the script is brilliant to, so to is the realism of the acting, for example the way they modernised the characters to fit into ancient times. <br /> <br />Not to be mixed up with the story of Jesus, it is more a anti terrorist group film, note the People's Front of Judea who are seemingly for the freedom of the Jews hate all other Jewish freedom groups, although they all seem to want the same thing. This is best exemplified in a scene where the PPJ meet another Jewish freedom group who have the same plan to capture the Romans pilots wife but instead of working together they fight each other for the right to have the credit of the capture. <br /> <br />That's weird, that reminds me of all those terrorist groups who say they hate America???? <br /> <br />That makes you wonder, are they doing their terror work to free people or is it for their own purposes???????  <br /> <br />Indeed just about everything has been taken the piss out of in this film apart from Jesus, and so anyone who claims this to be a ridicule of the story of Jesus probably hasn't seen the film at all or properly. <br /> <br />Another complaint was the way it portrays Jews, well it actually portrays them like normal everyday people,some are normal, and some not so normal. Although there is a funny scene where Brian declares how prowd he is to be Jewish. <br /> <br />It also underlines how people are portrayed as saviours without people knowing about them, brilliant example is Brian who is mistaken for a missiah and when fleeing from a mass group he eventually runs out of steam and hides, though eventually found the people believe he has led them somewhere, where infact as Brian rightly put it... 'You followed me.' <br /> <br />It is also interesting how The Romans are portrayed. The are looked on in the film as a very advanced and sociliased people but who know how to bring law and order to a place, and very expertly so. Although it is the leaders of the Romans (i.e The Emperours) who are portrayed as the real Roman idiots, just ask Bigus Dickus!!!!!! <br /> <br />Also the use of swearing is brilliant, it is used as a use to express emotion, and never overused (a problem that persists in many modern day comedies). It is used to add flavour to the comedy not to become the comedy. <br /> <br />The Life of Brian is best watched, Christmas and Easter times for it's full comedy effect, but you will still laugh your socks off if you watch it any other time of the year. <br /> <br />The oddity of Life of Brian is that it's a tragic film as the innocent Brian ends up being a marter of a cause he didn't create but others around him did. It's weird how the innocent always suffer first???????. <br /> <br />The Life of Brian along with The Holy Grail are definitely two recommended Monty Python films, and certainly two of the best comedy films ever. <br />
0062502182|5.0|Paulo Coelho's THE ALCHEMIST is a wonderfully charming book for anyone at any age. I received this book as a gift from a friend and a gift it truly is. This is the absolute book of following a dream through to the ends of the earth and discovering that what that dream is can change over the course of time.

B00097DX3U|4.0|I can't say it was worth the wait for this album since Audioslave's 2002 debut.But there is more good than bad on this album.The debut is still better.As for the people saying Chris Cornell wasn't using his full vocal potential on this album....well why ain't you singing for Audioslave then if you know so much? Like most rock bands not every album is gonna be played and sung the same way.Hell it would be boring listening to the same album each time its released.As for the songs here theres some good and some filler.My personal stand out tracks are \\"Be Yourself\\",\\"The Curse\\",The Worm\\",\\"Out Of Exile\\" and \\"Dandelion\\".One of the least favorites is the single \\"Your Time Has Come\\".I've listened to this song many times and still can't get into it.Just like \\"Drown Me Slowly\\" and \\"Doesn't Remind Me\\". When you listen to \\"The Worm\\" it sounds very Black Sabbath-ish,which is kinda cool.I thought \\"The Curse\\" was good surprise here.I always get a kick out of Tom Morello's guitar playing.His little tricks he does to make a distinct sound is cool.Nothing to crazy and complex,just a awesome sound.Its too bad alot more people can't get into Audioslave more.I hear just as much trash about them as Creed ever got.Oh well somebodys gotta be a hater.But if you already have Audioslave's first cd this won't be a bad pick up to go with it.
B00005JNBQ|3.0|Okay, the first time I tried to watch the movie I couldn't get through 20 minutes. I sat there thinking WHO IN THE WORLD WOULD FIND THIS MOVIE FUNNY. But then, the second time, I watched it with a group of friends and was forced to sit there in misery. Well, I wasn't in so much pain after all. You really have to watch this with the right group of people. Some parts of it are, I admit, quite great and hilarious. I can now understand why some people find it so funny. However, I'm still not a fan of this movie.
B0007VZ91C|5.0|It is my feeling that listening to Deva Premal's latest release DAKSHINA can be a transforming experience.  In my opinion, it is her best effort so far.  The human voice is capable of communicating tremendous depth and emotion.  And Deva Premal does not disappoint.  Her voice brings a message alive with love, devotion, and meditation through music that is nothing if not beautiful--beauty embracing truth.  If you surrender to the listening and travel in you will not be disappointed.  <br /> <br />V.  Banik
B0001CCXZW|5.0|Gilmore Girls is a greeeeeeeeeeat show with such amazing conversations between the Gilmores. Rory and Lorelai are perfect. Season one is the beginning of it all and is worth owning and watching again and again. There are just so many little things that they say that are perfect.
B0000942LT|3.0|Since the release of their sophomore effort (major-label debut) Dysfunction, Staind has shown the trend of losing heaviness in favor of more melody.  This trend continued on Break the Cycle.  Not surprisingly, 14 Shades of Grey is once again the most melodic, least heavy and newest Staind record to date.    Not to say that's a bad thing, in and of itself.  The melodies, as always, are for the most part catchy and well-written.  Voice-wise, Aaron Lewis is in top form on this record, and that alone makes it worth purchasing.      Perhaps the only exception is the track \\"Layne,\\" obviously a tribute to the late Alice in Chains vocalist Layne Staley.  Lewis tries to imitate the vocal harmonies of the defunct group, but his voice does not sound as haunting as Staley's when overdubbed on itself in the same fashion.      It is a well-done tribute in terms of evoking the memory of the AIC singer, but it does not fit with the rest of the CD.  The rest of the CD is pretty homogenous, though, so perhaps it's good just for variety's sake.    The biggest negative aspect to the record is the lack of variety in song topics.  Thankfully, the themes are not quite as oppressive as on previous releases-some tracks are actually about being OK psychologically-but the vast majority of the record is still dedicated to being depressed.  Hopefully, on future releases, song topics will further diversify.    Another problem with 14 Shades of Grey is that Mike Mushok's guitar style is getting a bit clichd: arpeggios for the soft, clean verses and sustained, distorted power/suspended chords for the louder but melodic choruses.  Here and there, he still throws in a riff or an interesting two-guitar part, and his style serves as a good backdrop to the vocals, but perhaps more riffs or a solo here and there would be less predictable.    Essentially, Staind are beginning to settle into a routine on this record.  It is a bit less heavy than Break the Cycle, but the themes and guitar style are basically unchanged.  It is catchy and worth purchasing, but hopefully they will evolve in a new direction in the near future.
B00005JMUA|5.0|Yes! Volume 2 ties the Kill Bill series together so nicely. It fulfills the classic Tarantino dialogues and storylines. But it also has amazing fighting scenes reflective from the crazy first volume. The fight between Elle Driver and The Bride is crazy and is the best thing ever. The movie becomes surprisingly very touching near the end and the soundtrack goes SO well with it (take a listen to those songs, by the way). Some people found it too slow (volume 2) but if you watch the first and the second together, which is what was meant to happen, it works perfectly. Amazing movie. Great action. Great story. Great acting and characters. So memorable.
B00000AFGM|5.0|Mechanical Animals is the third full-length release by the band and a complete reinvention of its sound.  Where Portrait of an American Family and Antichrist Superstar had attempted to push \\"dark\\" and \\"heavy\\" to their limits, this record makes the abrupt transition to a glam rock parody, mixing the \\"sex, drugs and rock `n' roll\\" attitude with the inevitable negative aspects that come with it.    Each song on the record is great, period.  Some of the tracks take longer to sink into the mind of the listener, but they are well worth it.  The songs vary in attitude from the mindlessly catchy (\\"New Model No. 15\\") to the dark-yet-head-bobbing (\\"The Dope Show\\") to the somber (\\"Speed of Pain\\" and \\"Coma White\\") to the heavy (\\"Rock is Dead\\") to the just plain hilarious (\\"I Don't Like the Drugs [But the Drugs Like Me]\\").    Perhaps the most brilliant musical aspect of the record is its use of the synthesizer.  Fitting in with the glam sound of the CD, it adds melodies to a number of the songs, most notably \\"I Don't Like the Drugs\\".    Also, typical of a Manson record, the lyrics are incredible.  Moving away from his previous themes of religion, family, molestation and social acceptance, but keeping the emotions of rage and depression intact, they include the topics of relationships, the degeneration of youth culture, and, of course, sex, drugs, and rock `n' roll.  In typical fashion, they are written to feel extremely personal without divulging many actual aspects of the singer's life: they, like all great art, are up to the audience to decipher.    On a side note, the name Marilyn Manson, whether referring to the person or the band, definitely carries a negative reputation.  This is often due to the actions of those involved, but just as often it is not: One of the Columbine shooters had one Marilyn Manson CD.    Anyone who honestly experiences a CD will find it to be thought-provoking and well made if they are open to the darker side of music.  Mechanical Animals is perhapsthe best Manson record to date, and it proves to the world the band's talent and adaptability to different styles.
B00005JMEW|5.0|Finally a movie from Tarantino! This is an awesome movie, period. Some people say it is too bloody, too much action, not enough story, etc. but that is not true! Kill Bill 2 takes care of the story aspect and as for too bloody...have you seen Reservoir Dogs? Pulp Fiction? Whatever. Kill Bill has amazing fighting scenes too cool to describe. So many memorable scenes and lines. Uma Thurman was also absolutely wonderful here along with the other wicked bad guys (or should I say girls). The Japanese release of the DVD is also better - it has more scenes, etc. and will be releasing in theatres in North America soon (according to Tarantino). WATCH KILL BILL!
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|This record saved a rather mediocre summer for music. Overall, it's a bit gentler and a lot better than the group's debut, Mer de Noms. Whereas the first album had only a handful of noteworthy tracks, Step should be listened to front-to-back. <br /> <br />This is likely due to the different creative process: with Noms, founder Billy Howerdel wrote all of the background music and had Tool singer Maynard James Keenan add vocals. On Step, Keenan helped with more of the music, and band membership changed to include Jeordie White (formerly Twiggy Ramirez of Marilyn Manson) and James Iha (formerly of the Smashing Pumpkins). <br /> <br />The only negative aspect of the record is the very first track: the six-minute-plus \\"The Package.\\" It is by far the weakest track musically, drags on too long and sounds too much like Tool-from the guitar tone to the song length to the odd time signatures to the vocals (for obvious reasons). <br /> <br />The rest of the record, though, is filled with great music: ethereal, dynamic backgrounds supporting Keenan's unique, mysterious and haunting voice. <br /> <br />The biggest surprise is \\"The Nurse Who Loved Me,\\" a quirky, indescribable-yet-catchy ode to the medical profession: \\"I'm taking her home with me / All dressed in white / She's got everything I need / Pharmacy keys.\\" <br /> <br />For any fan of gentle, deep alternative music with occasional heavy sections, it's a must-buy.
B0007OCG4W|1.0|I was very eager to see this movie when I saw the trailer and heard about it. Julia Roberts, Clive Owen, Jude Law and NAtalie Portman! I am in love with all of those actors but...not in this movie at all. It is supposed to be edgy, ground-breaking, fearless, tackling things like sex, cheating, etc. But it doesn't come across shocking or interesting. The excessive swearing and use of vulgur words stops being shocking in 10 minutes. Then you are left with these four people who are completely unstable. The idea of the movie, so I was told, was that the harder one tries to get closer to somebody, the further away they are from you. Sure. That works if you are these four individuals who do nothing but swear and cheat on each other so that they are all stuck in this crazy love square. There is no sense of connection or liking to any of the characters on screen so any time they cry, yell, smile (which is almost...never) the viewer just sits there blinking. The acting and script is awful. I don't know why Clive Owen and NAtalie Portman won awards over this (even though I love both actors). The movie just consists of \\"WHEN DID YOU SLEEP WITH HIM?\\" \\"I HATE YOU\\" \\"I LOVE YOU\\" \\"PLEASE COME BACK TO ME\\" \\"SLEEP WITH ME\\" \\"YOU ARE DISGUSTING\\" and on and on. The only thing that is watchable is Natalie Portman who is gorgeous in this movie (especially that end scene). But boo hiss to this.
B0008ISM40|2.0|A lot of people fell in love with Nine Inch Nails in high school. For me, the two-disc 1999 epic The Fragile perfectly captured the frustrations of adolescence, complete with screaming, depression and a me-against-the-world mentality. From there I picked up the rest of the catalog, and even wasted a Burger King paycheck or two on ill-conceived remix CDs. <br /> <br />Pretty Hate Machine was accessible; Broken was angry; The Downward Spiral was progressive - each found a special place in my CD collection, sometimes off to the side due to the oh-so-artsy, won't-fit-in-the-organizer cardboard packages.  <br /> <br />It's been five and a half years since then, and Nine Inch Nails's latest release, With Teeth, is a little of everything that came before. Only not as good as that description would imply, because Trent Reznor's songwriting just isn't there. <br /> <br />Simply put, With Teeth has too much filler for five years of work. \\"You Know What You Are,\\" for example, is basically a rewrite of The Fragile's \\"No You Don't,\\" only this time the chorus lyrics (\\"DON'T YOU F---ING KNOW WHAT YOU ARE!?!\\") demonstrate the fall of Reznor's way with words. <br /> <br />\\"The Collector\\" is sure to collect dust, with a forced gloominess that reminds listeners that, no, Reznor is no longer a depressed, fingernail-painting eighth grader. The intricacies of stanzas like \\"I pick things up, I am a collector / And things, well things, they tend to accumulate / I have this net, it drags behind me / It picks up feelings for me to feed upon\\" are sure to inspire intense thought. For anyone who doesn't know what \\"collector\\" means or eats feelings, anyway. <br /> <br />The title track is another flop, with hilariously exaggerated pronunciation (\\"With-uh teeth-uh!\\"). \\"Only\\" is supremely annoying, with Reznor rambling aimlessly over a techno beat in a matter reminiscent of Pretty Hate Machine's \\"Down in It.\\" <br /> <br />And so the record drags on, with awkward spoken-word sections, forgettable melodies and half-assed pseudo-pop hooks (\\"She turns me on.\\" Very inventive and very funky, Trent). Reznor tries to combine the mindless attitude of Pretty Hate Machine with the guitar and computer tones of The Fragile but can't quite swing it. <br /> <br />Thankfully, though, it isn't all bad. The lead track, \\"All the Love in the World,\\" steals a melody from The Fragile's \\"Even Deeper\\" but redeems itself with a decent chorus and interesting piano outro. <br /> <br />Also, while first single \\"The Hand that Feeds\\" is nothing fresh or spectacular, it is catchy. \\"Every Day is Exactly the Same\\" is up to typical Nine Inch Nails standards, though the lyrics get a bit cheesy at times, and the verses of \\"The Line Begins to Blur\\" bring a healthy dose of genuine self-loathing. \\"Beside you in Time\\" builds from a mediocre beginning into tense, thick, computer-generated harmonies. <br /> <br />\\"Right Where it Belongs\\" is easily the record's masterpiece - if only there were more like it. A lilting piano melody runs alongside a dreary, processed guitar line throughout the song, laying the foundation for a classic Reznor vocal line. Very much in the tradition of \\"Something I can Never Have,\\" \\"Hurt\\" and \\"The Great Below,\\" it's perfect wrist-slitting music: slow, depressed and hopeless. In short, it's awesome, despite the out-of-place sound of an audience's cheering two-thirds of the way through the track. <br /> <br />Trent Reznor has long been a mainstay of the alternative scene, with each record better and gloomier than the last, but he reached his peak with The Fragile. With Teeth demonstrates no growth, and only a minority of songs would have been good enough to appear on any other NIN album.  <br /> <br />Maybe he'll return to form with his next release (2010, if past trends are any indication), but With Teeth - plus the obligatory, overpriced remix compilations - won't hold fans' interest for five years.
B00000J6AG|5.0|...about Moby that stretches beyond remarking on his understated musical genius, wry humour and exquisite creativity.<br /><br /> This album was a classic from it's first pressing and will live on and on tirelessly. Thank the lord for intelligent, creative souls like Moby, the weightiness of his album sales speaks volumes about how starved of this kind of musical genre people are today. LONG LIVE MOBY!
B0007Y08IS|3.0|Much of the \\"Team America: World Police\\" discussion has focused on its politics. Some have called it pro-war, others anti-war. Some have called it both. The creators insist it's neutral. In the end it seems the movie will confirm whatever political bias one has going in.  <br /> <br />However, something else is more important: \\"Team America\\" isn't funny enough to live up to the hype. The sheer novelty of an all-marionette cast is certainly worth some humor points, but \\"South Park\\" creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone don't come near the standards set by much of their previous work. <br /> <br />The plot of the movie is amusing if not dynamite. The culturally insensitive Team America goes around the world, blowing up monuments without regret in their search for WMD, and in the end our heroes save the day for real...kind of. The Film Actors' Guild (F.A.G.) is a group of liberal douche-bags, but its members are clearly provoked by the destruction of the Eiffel Tower, the Great Pyramids, etc. F.A.G. members include Alec Baldwin, Sean Penn, Janeane Garofalo, Martin Sheen, Tim Robbins and Samuel L. Jackson. <br /> <br />Sure, there are some killer jokes here and there. But most of the best scenes have already been released via commercials, clips ([...] had several lengthy scenes) and reviews. And stupidly, the creators posted all the song lyrics online, taking away perhaps the movie's strongest element. \\"Everyone has AIDS\\" and \\"Ronery\\" are sure to become classics (the latter track, sung by Kim Jong Il, is somewhat racist - the lyrics use as many \\"L\\"s as possible, which Il sings as \\"R\\"s), but by the time fans get to the theater nothing is left to the imagination. <br /> <br />Except, that is, the mythical puppet sex scene. Reportedly, it took several tries for the filmmakers to avoid an NC-17 rating. In interviews they've claimed it's just what every kid does with dolls growing up. After all, the marionettes' joints and strings show. <br /> <br />This argument holds true -for those whose childhood dolls had hard nipples. Despite knobby groin areas, the scene is not enough \\"puppet\\" and too much \\"sex\\": the characters try plenty of odd positions, but no hilarious awkwardness, like that of the dolls simply walking, comes through.  <br /> <br />The scene could have been much funnier, even without the upside-down acrobatics. The audience waits for strings to get tangled, or for wooden thumping sounds, but all it gets is relentless puppet pile-driving with cheesy background music. Funny? Yup. But not gut-bursting. <br /> <br />That, sadly, is true of the whole movie. If something is hilarious, much of the audience has already heard about it. What's left is worth seeing, but no one leaves with sore cheek muscles from laughing so hard. <br /> <br />Essentially, see \\"Team America: World Police,\\" and do as little prior research as possible. Expect a good laugh, but it's not a film anyone will remember a decade from now.
B000268QB2|5.0|...their songs are fabulous and celebratory, the lead singer has a truly beautiful voice which is clear, resonates and is vast in range, everyone seems to have a favourite song and none of the songs sound like self indulgent whinning from a pretentious singer and an irritatingly political band who are not nearly as bright as they think they are.<br /><br /> The fact is this, Keane are dynamic and interesting and coldplay are boring and predictable and they sound NOTHING alike.<br /><br /> Trade in any coldplay CD's and get Keane instead, you will not regret it!
B000069CWE|3.0|A hastily thrown-together remix album, Reanimation focuses on the band's rap and techno sides, ignoring the fact that they have a large rock following.  A few of the tracks feature prominent rock artists, like Jonathan Davis and Aaron Lewis, but even their songs do not make it worth the price of the whole album.
B0007OCG4W|1.0|I was not in any way entertained by this movie. I love all types of films, but this one I could not get into.  I agree with the others who reviewed and said that it was basically all about 'I LOVE YOU' 'I DON'T LOVE YOU ANYMORE' 'I HATE YOU'   <br />'I WANT YOU BACK'  'ON SECOND THOUGHT, I DON'T LOVE YOU' <br /> <br />JUST PLAIN BAD!!!!

For me, the two-disc 1999 epic The Fragile perfectly captured the frustrations of adolescence, complete with screaming, depression and a me-against-the-world mentality. From there I picked up the rest of the catalog, and even wasted a Burger King paycheck or two on ill-conceived remix CDs. <br /> <br />Pretty Hate Machine was accessible; Broken was angry; The Downward Spiral was progressive - each found a special place in my CD collection, sometimes off to the side due to the oh-so-artsy, won't-fit-in-the-organizer cardboard packages.  <br /> <br />It's been five and a half years since then, and Nine Inch Nails's latest release, With Teeth, is a little of everything that came before. Only not as good as that description would imply, because Trent Reznor's songwriting just isn't there. <br /> <br />Simply put, With Teeth has too much filler for five years of work. \\"You Know What You Are,\\" for example, is basically a rewrite of The Fragile's \\"No You Don't,\\" only this time the chorus lyrics (\\"DON'T YOU F---ING KNOW WHAT YOU ARE!?!\\") demonstrate the fall of Reznor's way with words. <br /> <br />\\"The Collector\\" is sure to collect dust, with a forced gloominess that reminds listeners that, no, Reznor is no longer a depressed, fingernail-painting eighth grader. The intricacies of stanzas like \\"I pick things up, I am a collector / And things, well things, they tend to accumulate / I have this net, it drags behind me / It picks up feelings for me to feed upon\\" are sure to inspire intense thought. For anyone who doesn't know what \\"collector\\" means or eats feelings, anyway. <br /> <br />The title track is another flop, with hilariously exaggerated pronunciation (\\"With-uh teeth-uh!\\"). \\"Only\\" is supremely annoying, with Reznor rambling aimlessly over a techno beat in a matter reminiscent of Pretty Hate Machine's \\"Down in It.\\" <br /> <br />And so the record drags on, with awkward spoken-word sections, forgettable melodies and half-assed pseudo-pop hooks (\\"She turns me on.\\" Very inventive and very funky, Trent). Reznor tries to combine the mindless attitude of Pretty Hate Machine with the guitar and computer tones of The Fragile but can't quite swing it. <br /> <br />Thankfully, though, it isn't all bad. The lead track, \\"All the Love in the World,\\" steals a melody from The Fragile's \\"Even Deeper\\" but redeems itself with a decent chorus and interesting piano outro. <br /> <br />Also, while first single \\"The Hand that Feeds\\" is nothing fresh or spectacular, it is catchy. \\"Every Day is Exactly the Same\\" is up to typical Nine Inch Nails standards, though the lyrics get a bit cheesy at times, and the verses of \\"The Line Begins to Blur\\" bring a healthy dose of genuine self-loathing. \\"Beside you in Time\\" builds from a mediocre beginning into tense, thick, computer-generated harmonies. <br /> <br />\\"Right Where it Belongs\\" is easily the record's masterpiece - if only there were more like it. A lilting piano melody runs alongside a dreary, processed guitar line throughout the song, laying the foundation for a classic Reznor vocal line. Very much in the tradition of \\"Something I can Never Have,\\" \\"Hurt\\" and \\"The Great Below,\\" it's perfect wrist-slitting music: slow, depressed and hopeless. In short, it's awesome, despite the out-of-place sound of an audience's cheering two-thirds of the way through the track. <br /> <br />Trent Reznor has long been a mainstay of the alternative scene, with each record better and gloomier than the last, but he reached his peak with The Fragile. With Teeth demonstrates no growth, and only a minority of songs would have been good enough to appear on any other NIN album.  <br /> <br />Maybe he'll return to form with his next release (2010, if past trends are any indication), but With Teeth - plus the obligatory, overpriced remix compilations - won't hold fans' interest for five years.
B000850IHW|5.0|So you think you've heard Free Hand before? No, you haven't! An unbelievable mastering job, and there are 6 releases scheduled for this year (hope they can eventually re-master & re-release them ALL). There goes my allowance! Worth it for one of the most amazing bands ever, who TRULY deserve 21st century remastering to bring out the sounds and musical imagery they created.  <br />p.s. Check out Porcupine Tree's In Absentia.
B0000BYM3K|3.0|For a band a decade past its supposed peak, Iron Maiden's 2000 release Brave New World was shocking: it was perhaps their best. Unfortunately, it set a standard that Dance of Death cannot live up to. <br /> <br />It's not that Dance of Death is all bad, as there are a few top-notch songs. \\"Rainmaker\\" and \\"Journeyman,\\" easily on par with the material on Brave New World, come to mind. Most of the remaining tracks, however, are either derivatives of previous Maiden work or just plain cheesy.  <br /> <br />And in some songs, there is a mixture of high- and low-quality work. For example, the chorus to \\"Gates of Tomorrow\\" makes the mediocre verses worth sitting through, and the tapped guitar intro to \\"Paschendale\\" is interesting until the vocal spoils it. <br /> <br />Also, when viewed in terms of production instead of song quality, Dance of Death once again falls short of Brave New World. Namely, the vocals are a bit softer. One could argue that Bruce Dickinson's voice has simply gone downhill in the past three years-and that, likely, is a factor-but sheer volume in the mix is the biggest problem. While audible, Dickinson often fails to come through with the power necessary for epic heavy metal. <br /> <br />All in all, Dance of Death is only worth the price of purchase for hard-core Iron Maiden fans. Occasional listeners are not missing much, and newcomers would be much better off buying Brave New World or Seventh Son of a Seventh Son.
0786890754|5.0|How does she know???? I believe Cecelia was only 23 or so when she wrote this book. Anyone who has gone through the loss of a love, and trying to go on with living, will recognize the tremendous downs she writes about. The heart warming humor, that even in the saddest events of our lives continue to peek it's head, are so wonderfully illustrated by her. It's encouraging for people who experience sadness. Also her first book; Roxie Dunne, is a treasure. For such a young woman who can not have experienced the full scope of all of life's up and downs first hand, she did a wonderful job! I read both books with a smile on my face, a giggle and sometimes a tear rolling down my cheek. Cheers Cecelia!
B000000OSE|5.0|In all of music history, only two albums have come close to perfection. They are: Guns N' Roses' Use Your Illusion I and Guns N' Roses' Use Your Illusion II. <br /> <br />Guns N' Roses is perhaps most remembered for the 1987 smash hit debut Appetite for Destruction, but this 1991 double-album-released-as-two-discs-simultaneously stands head and shoulders above it musically. <br /> <br />Whereas Appetite for Destruction has 12 concise, guitar-driven, formulaic and catchy tracks, the Use Your Illusion CDs feature a total of 30 songs in many styles and of widely varying lengths.  <br /> <br />The later material made use of new instruments, most notably the piano. Also, the lyrics are much deeper in tone, and Axl Rose's vocals are complemented by Duff McKagan's (bass) and Izzy Stradlin's (rhythm guitar). <br /> <br />Some of the songs, like \\"Right Next Door to Hell,\\" \\"Perfect Crime\\" and \\"Garden of Eden,\\" are far heavier and faster than anything found on Appetite. <br /> <br />On the other end of the spectrum listeners find \\"November Rain,\\" an epic ballad, and the 9-minute classic \\"Estranged,\\" perhaps the best song ever written.  <br /> <br />These tracks each contain many different parts bridged by smooth transitions, and both emphasize lighter dynamics. <br /> <br />Also in the \\"epic\\" category are \\"Coma\\" and \\"Locomotive,\\" but these two bring heavier, loud sounds to the foreground. <br /> <br />Finally, the CDs often touch on a genre in one or two songs, never to return to it. `50s-reminiscent rock `n' roll can be heard in \\"Bad Obsession,\\" country in \\"You Ain't the First\\" and rap in \\"My World.\\"  <br /> <br />Each of the non-mainstream rock selections is done well, and they let the recordings breathe without overwhelming the listener. Even someone who hates country or rap can listen through both discs without skipping the offending tracks. <br /> <br />Essentially, the Use Your Illusion releases made up the high point in Guns N' Roses' career. Maintaining the killer songwriting of Appetite while working in greater variety and complexity, these two CDs have yet to be topped by the efforts of any other band.
B0002858YS|4.0|I recently acquired The Killer's cd Hot Fuss. I must say that I really do enjoy it. I am not a huge fan of synthsizers and such but the use of it is appropriate in their music. Most of all I like The Killers because they are unique. Their music is different from all the other bands that have gone mainstream, and is refreshing. I can't stop listening to \\"Andy you're a star\\" This song rocks!! It is slow and melancholy but Brandon Flower's voice is amazing on this one- by far my favorite. I still love \\"Mr. Brightside\\" even though it is way overplayed and I have heard it about a thousand times. It is unlike any other song I've heard in a while. The video's great too, but I'm sure everyone already knows that. \\"Smile like you mean it\\" is good too along with \\"All these things that I've done\\". I'm not a huge fan of \\"Somebody told me\\" but I guess that's just an idiosyncracy of mine. As for tracks 9-11, I don't usually listen to them often. I'm afraid that they are hints of fillers, but nonetheless, its still a great cd. I would definitely pick it up if your cd collection  is absent of it.
B000067CPX|5.0|This is a follow-up to the excellent Californication.  Another great album, By the Way is the ideal rock summer release.  With a sunny California vibe mixed with sad undertones, it taps into both a rock attitude and a summer desire to relax and have fun. <br /> <br />Though fans of early RHCP may not like the fact that it lays off the funk and rap of the 90's, the song quality of this record makes it their best.  Each song is catchy enough to inspire multiple listens, and many are sure to become RHCP staples.
B00000IPAX|5.0|First off, I will say that I am a diehard music fan in general. I listen to all types of music, not just pop-punk, like Blink 182 so masterfully supplies the music world with. There will always be people out there who waste their time writing terrible reviews in an attempt to inform the public of Blink's faults. Blink 182 is not punk. They are pop-punk, which in case no one has realized, IS a genre of music. These opinions are just that: opinions. They do not make the band bad or any less valuable than others out there. Now I will say that if you are considering buying Emena of the State, I would strongly encourage you to do so. This is by far the best cd, overall, that I have ever purchased. It is the only cd in my entire collection that I listen to completely without skipping songs, which says a lot. All the songs are great and unique and I have not grown tired of any of them, even with the incessant airplay of some of the singles. The lyrics are hilarious at times and the music is wonderful- the guitar playing rocks and Travis does an amazing job on drums. Here is a rundown on all the songs. I hope it may be helpful:  <br /> <br />1. Dumpweed- A great opener to the cd. Tom sings of the problems he finds with his girl among other things. Fast paced guitar and drumming.  <br /> <br />2.Don't Leave Me- similar to Dumpweed- Mark's first song is about a breakup. A very upbeat song that's fun to sing along to.     <br /> <br />3. Aliens Exist- Great song with great lyrics. Underneath the surface of immaturity lies a story of a lack of normality and being misunderstood. Tom does a great job on the vocals.  <br /> <br />4. Going Away to College- It took me a while to warm up to this one, but has become one of my absolute favorites. The lyrics are some of the best: Why does it feel the same to fall in love or break it off and if young love is just a game then/ I must have missed the kick-off/      <br /> <br />5. What's my age again- One of Blink 182's most popular singles. Amazing guitar- superb playing. Lyrics: I called her mom from a payphone/ I said I was the cops/ and your husband's in jail/ This state looks down on sodomy/ I have heard this one about a zillion times and I am still in love with it.   <br /> <br />6. Dysentary Gary- Yet another breakup song but it holds its place on the cd extremely well. Fast and funny.   <br /> <br />7. Adam's Song- This is one of my all-time favorite songs. It is the reason I bought the cd in the first place. Adam's song is a display of the guys' serious side and the lyrics  are deeper and have a lot of meaning. The music is Blink at their very best. The transition from verse to chorus is extremely well done and accurately portrays the feelings associated with the lyrics. Wonderful song.    <br /> <br />8. All the Small Things- One of the funner songs on the cd. It is not one of my favorites-largely due to overplaying, but still a great song. Good to blast with all your friends   <br /> <br />9. The Party Song- Another favorite. Fastest song on the album and Mark does an awesome job. Short but sweet.  <br /> <br />10. Mutt- Definitely in my top five favorites on the cd. This song is about the disfunctional relationship between a couple. The music is good as usual along with Tom's singing.  <br /> <br />11. Wendy Clear- Probably my least favorite but Mark's effort keeps this song playing on my stereo    <br /> <br />12. Anthem- Travis' rapid drumming and Tom's vocals put this song near the top of my list. Anthem is really the essence of Blink 182, and a large percentage of all other teens' lives out there. It shows the difficulty of growing up and the feelings of hopelessness and distress.
B000021XS0|4.0|This is a prog-metal concept record. <br /> <br />For those of you who are still reading, it's actually good.  No dungeons, no dragons, and the music doesn't get bogged down in the storyline. The story seems to be that of a young girl who was murdered, not that we care. <br /> <br />The first thing those new to Dream Theater will notice is not that they sound unique-in fact, what is impressive is how they manage to sound like every major prog band that came before them.  They have the guitar tone of Rush, the vocals of Queensryche, and the occasional acoustic sections of Pink Floyd.  Add in some keyboards and (sometimes) needlessly fast lead guitar playing, and you've got the Dream Theater sound.  Don't forget the occasional cheesy major-key piano ballad reminiscent of \\"The Wind Beneath my Wings.\\" <br /> <br />As critical as that may sound, the record, by and large, is very well done.  The songs are fantastic: the members of Dream Theater are truly master musicians, and they use dynamics and virtuosity to great effects.  The melodies are outstanding and well-sung throughout, and the rhythm guitar playing is always catchy and supportive.  The keyboards add great effects to the heavier tracks, though sparse piano balladry is not this record's strong suit. <br /> <br />The record, however, commits some of the typical concept-record blunders.  There are poorly-done spoken-word sections (usually brief, except for the very first and last tracks), an instrumental that isn't all that interesting and goes nowhere but the next song, and a few solos with far more speed than melody.  By far the best solos on the CD are the ones the listener can follow and sing along with, not the admittedly impressive displays of speed. <br /> <br />With the exception of the spoken-word sections, however, the storyline does not get in the way of great music, and this record is definitely worth buying for a fan of prog-rock/metal.  Despite its setbacks, it is expertly crafted, melodic, complex and catchy.
B0006U4UAU|3.0|Review by Tyler Wagnon: <br /> <br />Dance music is an intricate and very eclectic genre of music that plays host to several sub genres and styles. There are dance punk bands, raver artists, simple electronica, etc. For the most part, dance music does little to nothing for me for several reasons. The main issue is with the repetitious beats that just thump thump thump with no point or purpose. However, when done right, you would be hard pressed to find a more rump shakin' infectious style of music. <br /> <br />That is where LCD Soundsystem comes in. Within this self-titled affair, LCD takes the listener on a (fantastic) voyage of funky basslines, infectious beats, and quirky vocal arrangements that will have you humming along for sure, if not shakin' that thang like you know you want to. <br /> <br />James Murphy, as part of the production duo DFA and main man behind LCD, shows that he can do more than twiddle behind the knobs. Vocally he covers ground between soft cooing and shouting with his always witty and insightful lyrics. More than a one-trick pony, Murphy takes the listener through simple two-step beats, disco chord progressions, and beats that are always danceable. <br /> <br />For a dance rock album, LCD Soundsystem has already gotten more plays in my stereo than most would stand a chance at. The beats are fairly repetitive, but the music and vocals make up for it with an eclectic, but fitting mix. Listen to this instead of The Faint please.
B000089RVX|5.0|Since the end of Heart's heyday, the hard rock scene has needed a female to front a hugely popular group.  A talented one who doesn't sell herself on her looks, novelty and/or skanky lifestyle-I don't count Courtney Love, obviously.  Such a singer is found in Amy Lee, Evanescence's modest, gothic, beautifully voiced and infinitely talented frontwoman. <br /> <br />Evanescence has been in existence for several years, releasing scattered EPs but rarely playing live shows.  Their debut record Fallen, including two tracks from the Daredevil soundtrack, is an immensely promising debut. <br /> <br />Despite the misconception promoted by the lead single, Daredevil's \\"Bring Me to Life,\\" Fallen is by no means a Linkin Park-with-a-chick-singer-rap-rock album.  In fact, the rapper in the single is not even a member of the band.   <br /> <br />The rest of the record is filled with a mix of electronica, goth and metal that supports Lee's amazingly haunting vocal melodies.  This contrast-female vocals that could win American Idol over dark rock music-is what makes Evanescence unique and will give them a very broad fan base, ranging from Celine Dion fans to Goths to metal heads. <br /> <br />Lee is clearly the star of the band, as only her picture appears on the cover of the album.  The rest of the group proves itself competent if not always outstanding.  The guitar riffs are often catchy and inventive, but they are just as often simple, repetitive clichs meant solely as a background for Lee.  Given the quality of the vocals, however, it's not like one could blame Ben Moody (now out of the band) for not wanting to get in the way. <br /> <br />The piano, string and choral parts are breathtakingly beautiful, especially for a metal record.  The electronic passages drive the songs along, usually without making them sound overtly mechanical. <br /> <br />The lyrics on Fallen are consistent with the music: dark, spiritual and written in an abstract but very personal style.  They tell of deep emotional pain and death; yet, even on close inspection of the lyric sheet, one cannot tell any specific event in the writers' lives.  The themes are perhaps repetitive, but they serve their purpose extremely well.  They are personal enough to be true, but abstract enough that anyone can relate to them. <br /> <br />Fallen is the most promising debut in several years.  From beginning to end, it is a brilliantly crafted effort that leaves little obvious room for improvement.  Perhaps the only downside is that it will be difficult to follow.  Anyone who enjoys dark-themed music of any type would be well-advised to buy it.
B0002YCVXI|5.0|I was eating at this restaurant (thai cuisine) one day. I made my orders, so i waited for the food to arrive. I could not help myself, i was so into the music that i heard playing in that restaurant. I told my sister,my mum that \\"can't you hear that??that!! that strings and the melody..the mood..the feel..who's the artist???\\" I was so moved,even when i was eating i kept on concerntrating to the music because the volume is so slow. Desperately in search of the artist's and the album's name, i told my sister to ask for the name of the album, and the cashier showed the album to me.. and the next day, i brought home the album.. pop it in my cd player. When i heard it.. track 1...  I went still for a while...then gasped for air... it was so LOVELY...  then comes track 18... when it started i was still again..then the chorus came...my jaw dropped open..tears rolled down from my eyes... i cried.. i dont know how to express that feeling i had, but the closest i could figure out is AMAZING,BREATHTAKING (literally..) & LOVELY.    The collaboration between yo-yo ma and ennio morricone is unmistakable! truly amazing!! you can feel \\"it\\" behind the cello and the strings... BUY this one..no second thoughts! trust me, i am like that..unless i am sure it's very good... now i felt so damn glad that i bought it! You can listen to it over and over again...absolutely an album worth buying!

1592400876|4.0|The book \\"is the best defense of punctuation you'll ever read,\\" according to the publisher.  As a writer who needs all the help I can get with punctuation, I couldn't wait to get my copy. <br />Eagerly opening the book, I found I was expected to read: Acknowledgements (Well, eveybody knows that nobody reads Acknowledgements.) and the Foreword (Normally another pass, but this one is written by Frank McCourt.)  Now the book?  No, now a \\"Publisher's Note\\" followed by the Preface.  We're eighteen pages into the book before we confront the first chapter and what is it called? Introduction! <br />The publisher promised me that I would find this 240 page book \\"amusing,\\" and I'm not suggesting that these first thirty-four pages are not amusing or that they are not laced with good writing.  But, I want some clear concise rules of punctuation.  Maybe in the second chapter, The Tractable Apostrophe, but when the first page proved to be more of the same, I put the book down in frustration. <br />A couple of weeks later: What's this?  It's still on the New York Times best seller list?  All those people can't be wrong.  Picking up the book again and turning once more to the second chapter, I was soon rewarded for giving the book a second chance.  Beginning on page forty, are clear, concise rules for the use of the apostrophe. <br />Now, I wised up.  The comma chapter begins on page sixty-eight, but the rules for use don't appear until page eighty-three.  Having figured out the key to getting the real low down on punctuation, my frustration melted away. <br />I've even gone back and read the chapter beginnings and enjoyed learning about the conflict between Harold Ross and James Thurber over comma usage (pp 68-70).  And, who knew that the English in addition to driving on the wrong side of the road, sometimes use punctuation differently than we do?  Who would not be amused at the contrast between: \\"Am I looking at my dinner or the dog's?\\" and \\"Am I looking at my dinner or the dogs?\\" (p.26) <br />The author herself says, \\"So if this book doesn't instruct about punctuation, what does it do?...This one gives you permission to love punctuation.\\" (p. 33)
B0000630BT|5.0|Judas Priest's Painkiller is a classic, old-school metal record, done by a true originator. It was their final record with \\"metal god\\" Rob Halford on vocals, until Halford's return last year.   <br /> <br />Released in 1990, it is arguably their best and most balanced record, despite the fact that it contained none of their three biggest hits (\\"You've Got Another Thing Coming,\\" \\"Living After Midnight\\" and \\"Breaking the Law\\"). <br /> <br />I have to start with a recommendation to get the \\"Remasters\\" version instead of the used original release.  It includes the bonus track \\"Living Bad Dreams,\\" an absolutely killer older song that, inexplicably, was never included on the initial pressing of a Judas Priest CD.  Also, the booklet has some insights from the band on why the album kicks so much butt. <br /> <br />This record finds the perfect balance to the elements of Judas Priest: it's heavy as heck, yet it's catchy and singable (if you can sing that high).  This balance is best found in tracks like \\"Leather Rebel.\\" <br /> <br />According to the band's comments, the expanded heaviness was due to new (ex-King's X) drummer Scott Travis, an expert at heavy metal technique.  When combined with the \\"patented twin-guitar attack\\" of Glen Tipton and K.K. Downing and the professional singer's range of Halford, the ultimate in heavy, virtuoso rock performance became possible.  The powerful melodies and songwriting, apparently, were due to pure inspiration. <br /> <br />Some songs, however, lean more to one side than the other.  The title track (and first video), for example, is not impressively melodic, but it is a great song to head-bang to with the lights off in your dorm room.  By contrast, the mid-tempo epic \\"A Touch of Evil\\" is super-catchy if not very heavy.  It was an excellent choice for the other video. <br /> <br />Essentially, Painkiller is an excellent choice for any fan of old-school British metal bands.  It is catchy, intense and well-performed.
B000667FN8|2.0|Shut Up!: This song is okay. It is about what it sounds like; leave me alone and let me be how I what to be. 2/5 <br /> <br />Welcome To My Life: Again, it's okay. But very basic idea for a song that every artist has written at least one about. 3/5 <br /> <br />Perfect World: Breakup song. Not the best. 2/5 <br /> <br />Thank You: Okay, I love this song. Its really poppy and a whole lot better than Perfect World. 3/5 <br /> <br />Me Against the World> I like this song too. I think its the theme song for Damage Control, but its a lot like Shut Up. 3/5 <br /> <br />Crazy: This song is not worth the time it takes to listen to it. 1/5 <br />  <br />Jump: Again not really worth the time, but not nearly as bad as Crazy. 2/5 <br /> <br />Everytime: Its OKAY.emphasis on okay. 2/5 <br /> <br />Promise: I love this song. Its the best one on the CD. 4/5 <br /> <br />One: I said Crazy wasnt worth the time it takes to listen to it, but this song is even worse than that. it should never have even been recorded at all. 0/5 <br /> <br />Untitled: Why didnt they just give this song a name? Was it that hard to come up with one at the time? But this song is okay. 3/5 <br />
B00000I07P|5.0|Slippery When Wet is my first recollection of music ever (my father bought the phonograph record shortly after it came out, when I was 2 or 3), and I have yet to get sick of it. <br /> <br />For those more familiar with the band's recent work, Slippery When Wet won't sound like Bon Jovi. Though the Bruce Springsteen-esque attitude is sometimes evident (especially in \\"Wanted Dead or Alive\\"), the overall sound is pure 80s. <br /> <br />Even compared to 1988's New Jersey, Jon Bon Jovi comes off noticeably young, and the guitars and keyboards sound far more processed.  This can be seen as a positive or a negative, but it doesn't get in the way of great songwriting. The album is incredibly catchy, straight through.  <br /> <br />Due in part to the band's maturation, in part to the developing singer/songwriter feel and in part to help from professional songwriter Desmond Child, Slippery When Wet stands head and shoulders over Bon Jovi's good-but-dated first two records. <br /> <br />In terms of substance (as opposed to head-bobbing poppiness), new fans might want to go with the heavier-handed Keep the Faith or These Days. Perhaps the band found the best balance between catchiness and worldliness in New Jersey.
B000000ORE|5.0|my friend gave me this cd because he thought id like it.  of cource since i had never heard of tesla before hand i didnt expect much out of it.  i popped it inside my cd player expecting mindless screaming and off key guitaring.  from the very first track, i felt this band was something special.  after i heard the chorus to \\"Hang Tough\\"  I just felt so much power coming from jeff keith's voice, it was incredible.  following that track is another underrated track \\"lady luck\\"  catchy verses flow into an even catchier chorus.  i can totally relate to the song, i feel many can. basically hes saying hes getting pretty screwed over and he wants to know whats up.  after that track is the epic \\"No way out\\" i love them rhythem guitar at the beginning, very in your face as long with the lyrics. \\"you know im on a slick trip im always ready!! to kick ***\\"  by the time you hear the chorus you realize its not the song you thought it was.  i dont want to give 2 much away but the bridge mixing with the chorus is incredible \\"makes me feel, like im, heading down, a one way dead in street, THERES NO WAY OUT NO WAY OUT, of this living hell, NO WAY OUT NO WAY OUT, unless your walk heavens trail\\"  very emotional i felt.  the next track i didnt care for so im not going to discuss that.  track 5, \\"Lazy days Crazy Nights\\",one of my all time favorites from tesla.  it starts off with a very unique sound, sort of sad sounding and at the same time very gritty.  after hearing the chorus you will feel you have heard many bands sing about the topic of partying but will realize none have ever sounded like this, thats what i like most about it.  i didnt care for track 6 either.  track 7 is one of the fastest tracks tesla has done. its entitled \\"yesterdaze gone\\"  this is another very unique song.  its very fast paced, yet its about heartbreak.  its a great song to listen to full blast, speeding down the highway.  track 8, \\"makin magik\\" another great song, very catchy chorus.  this song has great rhytem and easy to sing lyrics.  but what i notice most is the chorus with jeff keith almost screaming MAKIN MAGIC MAKIN MAGIC!!!, it aint no mystery.  this song is about sex, yet its not as strait forward with it like some bands sing about it.  the next track is entitled \\"the way it is\\" although its one of their better known songs, i never really cared for it.  track 10, entitled \\"flight to nowhere\\"  i like the helicopter sound at the beginning but i didnt care much for the lyrics, but did have a catchy chorus \\"GOING DOWN im on the flight to nowhere\\" not my favorite from tesla.  next is their most known song and for good reason, the love ballad entitled \\"love song\\"  it starts off with 2 acoustic guitars.  sounds almost midevil themed.  very sweet sounding song.  its about how his heart was broken, but he found new love.  his message is, dont let heart break get you down, love will find a way.  beautiful track.  the music is incredible as well.  the next track entitled \\"paradise\\" is another love song.  it starts off with a unique sound, thanks to studio recording.  its about how hes off on the road and has to say good bye to his love, in the end of cource he makes his way back to her.  another great tesla song.  the last track is my least favorite of the cd, but still isnt bad.  i hope you find my review helpful.  this is must buy for rock fans. <br /> <br />hang tough-7/10 <br />Lady luck- 7/10 <br />no way out- 9/10 <br />be a man- 3/10 <br />lazy days crazy nights 8/10 <br />Money (forgot the title) 2/10 <br />yesterdaze gone 6/10 <br />makin magik 7/10 <br />way it is 6/10 <br />flight to nowhere 5/10 <br />love song 10/10 <br />paradise 8/10 <br />partys over 5/10
B000002H70|5.0|Few bands have had as much impact on the alternative rock scene as England's The Cure. Their 1989 release \\"Disintegration\\" is a masterpiece of gloomy goth-rock.    There are two basic types of Cure songs: happy-sad pop gems like \\"Friday I'm in Love\\" and accessible dirges like \\"Out of this World.\\" \\"Disintegration\\" is made up almost solely of the latter; even upbeat tracks like \\"Fascination Street\\" could hardly be called flat-out pop.    Of course, real Cure fans prefer darker fare.    \\"Disintegration\\" is a great album all the way through, but there are a few standout tracks. \\"Fascination Street,\\" as previously mentioned, is unique for its moderately fast tempo and frantic bass line, while \\"Lovesong\\" is a high-quality track that artistically puts optimistic, clich love lyrics over a dreary background.    \\"Plainsong,\\" \\"Lullaby\\" and \\"The Last Dance\\" are typical to the album in style - slow and bleak - but are of an above-par quality.    The album's best track, however, is \\"Pictures of You\\"-perhaps the best Cure song ever, both the lyrics and music evoke the ecstasy-meets-depression mood that defines the band's sound. It's a bit too long for its own good (a shortened, poppier, near-perfect version appeared on the greatest-hits collection \\"Galore\\"), but the power and allure of the song come across well.      The Cure has had plenty of great records including, most recently, 2000's \\"Bloodflowers\\" (the self-titled release of '04 was pretty mediocre), but \\"Disintegration\\" is most memorable because of its gloomy atmospheres and high quality. Any fan of dark, melodic music would be well-advised to buy it.
B000001EUR|5.0|With this cd, the scorpions mastered the mix between rockers and ballads.  There is seriously not one bad track on here.  If you have to get one Scorpions cd, this is the one you want.    track 1- Bad Boys Running Wild-  This first track is in your face from the start.  I love how klaus sings the first verse, but instead of the chorus you get a pause, then the guitar riffs start again with no voice.  I love it. The chorus itself is great as well. the bass is also excellent in this song. One of the best ive heard from them.     Track 2 Rock you like a hurricane- I feel is one of the best songs ever composed, musically, and lyrically and the solo is a masterpiece.  but for the people who only know scorpions for this song, you need to expand.     Track 3 Im leaving you- this track is about a guy whose going away on the road and has to leave the girl he loves behind.  Tt sounds like a break up song til you hear the chorus, which is fantastic, very catchy. he says \\"keep me in your mind, til i, come back to love ya.  one of my favorites on this cd     track 4 Coming Home-starts off very slow and ballad like, but then just takes off on ya, not many bands can do that with a song but these guys can. great listen     track 5- Same Old Thrill- good ole fast paced rock and roll.  pretty good listen to     track 6 Big city Nights- i love the opening riffs to this song, as soon as it starts my eyes light up and i know its time to party .  Everytime i hear the chorus i always stand up and shout \\"BIG CITY!!!!!!BIG CITY NIGHTS  YOU KEEP ME ROCKIN!!!!!!!  another great song.      track 7 As Soon As The Good Times Roll- starts off softly saying that you shouldnt let the bad times ruin your life, then the pretty catchy chorus comes in but my favorite is the bridge very melodic.     track 8 Cross Fire- I love the drums in this song, such a smooth listen.  The song is about being anti war. I really like the chorus in this song as well.       Track 9 Still Loving You- Last but certainlynot least, of one of greatest love ballads ever written.  It starts off slow and sort of hypnotic , but picks up intensity every verse until the end when he just lets his emotions go when he sings \\"STILL LOVING YOUUUUUUUUUUUU I NEED YOUR LOVE STILL LOVING YOUUUUUUUUUU.\\" brings chills up my spine.  This is a must have cd.
B0001Z53AQ|3.0|Eminem rose to fame for his fresh take on the rap genre: Violent fantasies and mock braggadocio, played out with healthy doses of humor and expertly-constructed, flowing, intricate rhymes. He ditches this formula when rapping with D12, however, joining the rest of the group in rapping about \\".44s,\\" \\"b-----s\\" and domestic violence, without irony. <br /> <br />That said, the group's sophomore effort, \\"D12 World,\\" is a well-crafted if mostly forgettable album. All of the group's members prove themselves competent lyricists, again disproving any conception that their success is due only to Eminem's coattails. <br /> <br />Stupidly, the album starts off with its weakest track, \\"Git Up;\\" surprisingly, the downright bad song is courtesy of the group's star. It's set to the incredibly grating tune of \\"The Name Game\\" (\\"Anna banna bo banna,\\" or however it goes). Enough said. <br /> <br />The CD improves rapidly from there, however. <br /> <br />By far, the album's standout track is the first single, \\"My Band.\\" Though it gets annoying with repeated listens, it provides a tongue-in-cheek take on Eminem's preeminence in the group. Against a fake teen-pop beat, the band rebels against the \\"lead singer,\\" who gets more than his fair share of women and luxuries on tour. <br /> <br />Another song worthy of mention is \\"How Come,\\" a song about growing away from a longtime girlfriend. Though both the lyrics and melody of the chorus could have used some reworking, it remains a powerful track. <br /> <br />Other than these tracks, most of the CD mindlessly if artistically blows off testosterone, in the forms of drunken rabble-rousing (\\"40 Oz.\\"), womanizing (\\"I'll be Damned\\"), misogyny (\\"B----\\") and aimless violence (\\"Get my Gun,\\" \\"American Psycho II\\"). <br /> <br />Occasionally, these themes are woven together in a somewhat-worthwhile manner. For example, \\"Just Like U\\" is about the problem of raising a child while publicly advocating demented behavior. It's something of a re-write of Eminem's \\"Role Model,\\" but with a more focused and personal angle. <br /> <br />Among the most stomach-turning lines: \\"You're my son / I'm trying to teach you something / You're e(halfheartedly censored)ght years old? / It's time to start f----n'.\\" Disturbingly enough, children's voices are used in the chorus, a la Pink Floyd's \\"Another Brick in the Wall (Part 2).\\" <br /> <br />At the end of the record, listeners are left satisfied if not ecstatic with their purchase. It is worth listening to repeatedly, straight through, but it lacks the intelligence, humor, irony and diverse subject matter of an Eminem record - forever the yardstick of the group's work.
B000002H2H|4.0|this was the 3rd metallica cd i bought. Overall, my favorite by Metallica   track 1: \\"fight fire with fire\\"- sweet acoustic sound at the beginning turned into a head bangin, fist pumpin rager.  my only complaint is the vocals, james hetfield sounds so annoying toward the end when he shouts \\"FIGHT FIRE WITH FIRE FIGHT FIRE WITH FIRE FIGHT FIRE WITH FIRE over and over again.  in fact the first tiime i heard this track i changed it after that part because it was driving me crazy.      track 2 \\"ride the lightning\\"  love the sound of this song, clearly studio made but great none the less.  i like the topic of this song about dying in an electric chair.  i just didnt feel James really sold it on this one, i felt no emotion really from him.  cept for the bridge \\"SOMEONE HELP ME PLEAES GOD HELP ME\\" this song has one of the greatest guitar solos ive ever heard.  great listen     track 3 Whom the Bell Tolls-  i like the start to this song with the bells.  fantastic lyrics about war.  this is a must listen.  i really like the chorus as well.     track 4 fade to black-  i have mixed feelings about this song.  this song has very simple lyrics yet you can really feel the emotion in james' voice.  The guitars really set the tone in this song so in the end i can say i like it, i love the opening acoustic, very sad sounding. This is a track you can listen to over and over again and can relate to.     track 5 trapped under ice-not my favorite metallica song,after hearing fade to black, this track just feels mediocre to this one, stll worth a listen,     Track 6-escape what stands out for me in this song is the chorus, very memorable.  simple guitar riffs yet powerful enough to jam to .  one of the better tracks on the album.     Track 7- pretty good song, typical thrashing metallica.  Does kind of get old after a while.      Track 8 call of ktulu- one of the best instrumentals ive ever heard. i love the intro, but it just gets better and better as the song goes on. you know the feeling when your stomach jumps when your on a roller coaster, thats how I feel when I hear this song.

B00097DX3U|2.0|I am very very disapointed about the new <br />Audio Slave album.This is not as good as <br />the first album and in fact it's not very <br />good at all.The first album is the best album <br />so far that they've put out.They did say that <br />they had all these song's already written when <br />the first one came out.They took all the best  <br />song's and put them on the first record.Now on <br />the new album what you're getting is the left <br />over crap that they didn't want on the first <br />album.Although there are a couple decent song's <br />on out of exile such as \\"Your time has come\\" and <br />\\"Be your self\\" are what I feel the best 2 song's <br />on here.\\"Be yourself\\" is already over played on  <br />most rock stations and I'm sick of hearing it. <br />There's also alot of slow song's on here and not <br />many rockin' tunes at all.Not they having slow <br />song's is a bad thing but too much of it just <br />get's boring and not entertaining to the listener. <br /> <br />So save your money and buy something that's better. <br />
6303921248|2.0|I greatly anticipated the arrival of my Pride and Prejudice tape set. I set aside the perfect moment and the perfect time so that I could indulge in all six volumes back to back. I had recently read the book and was quite excited to see it acted out. Much to my dismay the movie was a bit dull and in some instances hard to follow. Had I not read the book, I would not have had a clear understanding of some of the scenes. Overall, the movie contained many many elements of the book, but perhaps my expectations were simply too high.  I did not find Jennifer Ehle particularly convincing as Elizabeth Darcy. She made annoying faces and appeared considerably older than her implicit age of around 20. It's worth watching, but it's not as intriguing as I had hoped. Maybe I will find another version of the book more to my liking.
0375703764|5.0|Warning: this is not light reading. If you're looking for fluff or mass-market action-suspense, this is not it. If you have the time to immerse yourself in a book, prepare to be entranced. <br />There aren't enough words to describe how utterly amazing this book is. Ambitious, creative, unlike anything you have read or are likely to read in the future. The act of reading the book forces you to get involved in the story, the words are in motion. Words tumbling on each other, squeezed into a little square on the page, flipped upside down or visible backwards on the other side of the page... every bit of the design of this book is done for a reason. You can feel the claustrophobia or the wide open space, you can feel the confusion and desperation of the characters in the book because you are feeling the same thing just reading it.  <br />Not only is the story good, but the book itself is truly inspiring, one that I am proud to have in my collection.

B00005JNQ8|3.0|The point of \\"The Interpreter\\" seems to be that in a civilized world one should always drop the machine gun and rather use diplomacy and the UN. Now, if we could just convince our president to do that. Anyways, I found this to be a powerful movie that sneaks up on you. I found myself feeling underwhelmed for the first hour or so, only to be completely enthralled by the time the credits rolled. This film, which lives and dies with its storytelling ability, overcomes many of the pratfalls of the political thriller to tell a powerful story.  In most political thrillers the director takes us to a land of make believe where really important people are replaced by people who they tell us are important.  By avoiding this you can avoid character development of the villains (see \\"All the Presidents Men\\" and while not a political thriller a film nonetheless \\"Fahrenheit 9/11\\"). This film contains the make believe land of Motobo, and with the filmmakers not wanting to name names it sort of neuters the film. That is not to say the movie is totally apolitical, UN strife, suicide bombers, and terrorism are things born out of our recent political past.  The film revolves around a Motoban citizen who now works in the UN named Sylvia (Nicole Kidman) who hears about a assassination plot that is to be executed inside the UN. Sean Penn and Catherine Keener are the people the government sends to investigate the threat (playing quintessential Sean Penn and Catherine Keener characters).  From there people's pasts are examined, and Sylvia is thrust into the middle of Motoban's political upheaval. There are at least 3 very good suspense scenes that were impressive to me. I could have done without the romance between Kidman and Penn. I know some girls out there will only show up for any movie if they think there is a possibility that the climax will involve a wedding in a park. However, and I don't know about you, when I'm knee deep in Motoban politics I don't have time for anything else. I also enjoyed the connections this film had to my real life. Oren's Daily Roast (my employer) was represented in the form of three coffee cups. Also, when the bus blows up, it blows up on Nostrand Ave. in Brooklyn, the same street that I live on. Those things aside, this is a very enjoyable movie. ***1/2lso enjoyed the connections this film had to my real life. Oren's Daily Roast (my employer) was represented in the form of three coffee cups.

0060925000|4.0|I loved reading about Lata, the main character, and I endured all the stuff about the zamindari abolition bill (although I felt enriched by it afterward), but I was let down by the ending.  Did Lata feel she could live her whole life with Haresh?  I will never know.
B000001FFJ|5.0|Though not quite as brilliant as Bone Machine (but then, what is?), Rain Dogs is yet another fantastic album from the one and only Tom Waits. Its one of his 80s albums, meaning that experimental/avant-garde is added to the already eclectic mix that made up his 70s pre-Swordfishtrombones albums.<br /><br />Uncompromising in its sparse, experimental instrumentation, Rain Dogs is nonetheless very listenable for those who know what to expect. That's the beauty of Waits - unlike a lot of experimental artists (who still make great music, mind) he doesn't exchange listenability for experimentation.<br /><br />The music itself is full of variety. Dark, eerie and sparse to loud, bluesy rock, every one of these 19 songs has its own character. Wait's vocals are equally diverse, be it his calm cool bluesy voices, his aggressive growl or his delicate, drunken crooning. As always, the lyrics he's singing are always poetic and full of character which only add to the atmosphere of the song (bearing in kind that the atmosphere changes from song to song).<br /><br />Ah, sod it. There's already 100 other reviews for this album that praise it and describe it (many of which have done better jobs than me), so I'll just end with this: Tom Waits is one of the finest singers, lyricists and songwriters of the twntieth century and Rain Dogs is one of the strongest albums that proves it. If you like anything about Waits, you'll at least appreciate Rain Dogs. Personally, I love it.

0440180295|4.0|I started reading Vonnegut on the advice of a friend.  I started with Slaughterhouse Five because I had heard the title before.  I must say that I really enjoyed it.  The style is realy quite refreshing and the plot itself is brilliant.  The reason that I only gave it four stars was because of the unnecessary use of graphic sexual description.  I understand that some writers may feel that they need to use these sort of descriptions in their writing, but I, for one, believe that a book can be just as good without these references.  My reading experience has never been elevated by the inclusion of such content.  Still, though, a very good book overall.
B000002UA2|4.0|This soundtrack has a very mellow flow to it. I think people underrate too much. Yes, it's not WISH YOU WERE HERE, DSOTM, or THE WALL, but it is still good. You can't compare floyds works to those albums and judge it that way. Most of their other albums would get a one. It is still an amazing soundtrack. A few of my fav songs on this cd are, OBSCURED BY CLOUDS (awesome instrumental), Wots...UH THE DEAL (nice soft lyrical song very nice), STAY (I think right now my fav song on the album that could change though) If you are a true fan of floyd and arn't one of those punks that only likes them for DSOTM, you may find this album a nice compilation to your collection.
B00005221M|4.0|You don't have to look very hard to recognize when someone is a master of his or her craft. Saying that, for example, Babe Ruth and Willie Mays were masters of their craft is not a risky venture and neither is an assertion that Shakespeare was a master playwright. But when it comes to directing motion pictures, that assertion is a bit harder to make. For one reason, it is fair to argue that, in the moviemaking hierarchy, direction ranks at best, third in order of importance behind acting and writing. But when the actors and writers differ yet a catalog of movies is populated mostly by excellent examples of the medium, it goes without say that any common denominator should be looked at as a reason for the consistent excellence of the same. By that rationale, it can be said that Michael Mann is a master of his craft. His resume certainly indicates a preponderance for great directing. \\"Thief\\", \\"Heat\\", and \\"The Insider\\" are all excellent films; so is \\"The Last of the Mohicans\\" <br /> <br />New Jerseyan James Fennimore Cooper's novel of the same name has been translated to the screen many times, with varying levels of success. The latest version on film is Mr. Mann's 1992 production starring Daniel Day Lewis, Madelaine Stowe, and Wes Studi. I guess it can be said that it is to my detriment that I have not seen most of the prior productions of this classic story. However, I don't believe that prior accomplishments and/or failures in telling this story have very much bearing on the merits of the most modern envisioning of the same. Mr. Mann's realization of his and Christopher Crowe's script is as successful a dramatization of elements in Cooper's story as can be expected from a two hour movie. In short, the plot is fine; it leaves little to be desired. <br /> <br />The performances of the actors, on the other hand, leave nothing to be desired. Yes, the most visible of all the cast, Daniel Day Lewis comes across as over the top at times. The \\"stay alive\\" exchange behind the waterfall in the third act of the movie comes to mind as far as this goes. But this minor trifle may be mitigated by shortcomings in the writing; a couple of the other lines Lewis' Hawkeye has in the movie seem to reinforce that idea. Nitpicking aside, Lewis delivers a Hawkeye that is supremely confident, charismatic, and almost haughty in his righteousness. It is a performance akin in it's excellence to Lewis' Gerry Conlon, Danny Flynn, and Will Cutting. It is not the best performance of this movie which is enough of an endorsement of the quality of the whole cast. That honor has to go to Wes Studi. His Magua is so irrevocably evil that you can't help but root against the guy. His cold and disaffected predictions of what he will do to the \\"gray hair\\" are indications of a psychopathic nature. Yet, when you hear why Magua hates Munro, you begin to doubt your own feelings against him. Then the revelation during the Huron tribal council scene at the end of the film that revenge is not enough for Magua reinforces your first opinion of the guy. <br /> <br />The other performances in the movie are quite good as well. Jodhi May's mousey Alice Munro serves as an excellent metaphor for what war can do to someone as she spends the vast majority of the movie in a state of perpetual shellshock. It's a performance that also serves to contrast superbly Madeleine Stowe's exceptional depiction of Cora Munro as a strong and fiercely willful woman of the frontier. Steven Waddington is good at portraying Major Heyward, a noble soul buried underneath a warrior blinded by duty. And Russell Means and Eric Schweig are very effective in their roles of Hawkeye's \\"Indian\\" father and brother. <br /> <br />Another star not yet mentioned is one that doesn't appear on screen but works behind the cameras. That is Italian cinematographer Dante Spinotti. That this movie's visuals are gorgeous isn't a surprise given the locations where it was shot. What is a surprise is the stark contrast createdby the juxtaposition of the beauty of nature and the ugliness of war. The exceptional and comparative visual quality of both in this movie is best exemplified by the ambush sequence in the forest after the surrender of Fort William Henry. It is here that the two are brought together splendidly almost like a real life realization of the \\"Yin Yang\\" symbol. Visuals on this level are no accident just as the fact that Mann has worked with Spnotti on a number of other films is no coincidence. <br /> <br />Which brings this review full circle. All the individual elements of a movie can be excellent but if they're not brought together effectively, then the final product will be muddled. But Mann is a master of his craft. He brings in the right cinematographer. He consults on and writes the right script. He directs talented actors to say and do the right thing. Finally, he blends all the elements into an excellent example of how a movie can always serve, at the very least, the purpose of great escapism. <br /> <br />8.5 stars of 10
B00076ZZ9I|4.0|Good album, but why the heck did they realese it like 10 times?, Is the band really that greedy for money? Well I dont know what version I have, but I'm not buying this album every few months just to get each version. Best songs are You shook me all night long, Back in Black, and Hell's Bells
B000002GJH|5.0|i really do miss the early 90's because i always felt thats where rock music shined the most.  now as in 2005 you just can't come across a band like this anymore.  sure theres audioslave and pearl jam is still around but they don't really stand out like temple of the dog.  i've overlooked this cd for so long, because i only heard  hundger strike and wasn't really to interested, but then a couple of years ago when i heard say helloo to heaven i was instantly hooked. i loved the bluesy feel to the song and i dont think chris cornelle  voice has never sounded better. if your a fan of chris cornelle, soundgarden, pearl jam or even audioslave,or rock in geneeral pick this one up you will not be disappointed :)
B00082IJ08|5.0|I have not let this album out of my cd players since the day it was released. I have been a fan of the Gorillaz since I first heard clint eastwood in early '01. I waited patiently and got this wonderful work of art. Starting right after \\"intro\\" with the strong \\"are we the last living souls\\" the entire album flows. It's not like you are lisening to seperate songs cause they all flow together perfectly. Album highlights include. <br />\\"Dirty Harry\\" <br />\\"Feel good Inc.\\" <br />\\"All alone\\" <br />\\"DARE\\" <br />\\"Fire coming out of a monkey's head\\" <br /> <br />And to the reviewer that stated that everything Albarn has touched since leaveing blur has turned to gold is not true...he never left Blur. They are actually at work on another album. Demon days is very similar in style to 03's THINK TANK.
0385474547|2.0|So I'm in 9th grade, and I had to read this book. We read so many interesting things, \\"Frankenstein\\", \\"Animal Farm\\", and \\"To Kill A Mocking Bird\\". And then this book. Most boring book I think i've ever read in my life. Even so it does go by pretty fast, and catched you at moments. But, the yams got to me.
B000003TA4|4.0|First off,I have to agree with the guy a couple of spaces below me, this \\"Prophet Gorden\\" or whatever his name is, should be sent to prison for abusing his son.If you read the \\"Prophets\\" review,he says he beat his kid for lisiting to Nirvana!Getting back to the album, this is on of rock/grunges best ever!Kurt Cobain(R.I.P.)was a rock genius,simply one of the best.This CD fetures the Nirvana classic \\"Smells Like Teen Sprit\\",one of their most well known songs.The rest of the album is also very,very good.So if you want a great album,by a great band,buy this!
B000002LE6|5.0|This was a pivitol time in Prince's carrer and it showed his new designs for the future. He lost lisa and wendy and after he pulled the black album he felt a new spirital uplifting. these events led to this album and this album led to the NPG as we know them. The first track \\"Eye No\\" is a funky band like number that showed where Prince was going Musicly with the implimentation of a band in his product. \\"Alphabet St.\\" what needs to be said about one of this artist greatest hits of all time. This song is a funkier extended version of the one that is on the hit's so I really request you listen to it. \\"Glam slam\\" is my personal favorite on this disk because of pure orcestraition. In this song prince uses a symphony with beautiful violin arrangements. He used Clarie Fischer who he worked with a lot on Parade to give it that french feel. \\"Anna Stesia\\" is a highly emotional song with ties to his new religous findings. This is a very nice song and one that really came from the man's heart. \\"dance on\\" really makes you want to get up and dance with it's soulful guitar licks. This song has a nice job done on the drums which brings it all together. \\"lovesexy\\" is a smoth funky cross between funk and pop. It can be to quirky for some people but others will be open to it. \\" I wish U Heaven\\" is a song that gives an uplifting sort of feeling. it is a popish bubble gum feel that has a soulful creshindo in the chorus to it that really makes it mellow and versitile. \\"Positivity\\" is a funky feel to it but doesn't follow in its funk predisecors footsteps. This album overall is to me one of his finest efforts and definatly worth it's 5 star rating.
B00007E8V4|5.0|This is System's best album before Mezmerize. Very sad that it was commercially overlooked. All the songs are brilliant. Buy it (steal it) now!
B000002H97|5.0|With this album metallica got lured in to pop commercial success. Many people call this album a sell out and label it among metallicas work post this album, but it is in fact still metal just only commerciallized. Sure you could call that selling out but whatever, all that matters is that the music on the album is still good (although not as good as their previous albums). This is Metallica's final album before they sold out and turned crappy. Heres what I think of the songs.    1.Enter Sandman (5/5)- a great song but I hate how most people know Metallica by this song, they have much better songs than this  2.Sad But True (5/5)- My second favorite song on the album, an awesome heavy riff  3.Holier Than Thou (3/5)- an okay song  4.The Unforgiven (5/5)- great ballad song about slavery  5.Wherever I May Roam (5/5)- awesome riff  6.Dont Tread On Me (5/5)-My favorite song on the album, really catchy song about a rattlesnake  7.Through The Never (4/5)- good riff reminiscent of Master Of Puppets  8.Nothing Else Matters (3/5)- a total pop sell out, this song is even too cheesy for Air Supply  9.Of Wolf And Man (3.5/5)- okay song about a werewolf if you havent already guessed  10.The God That Failed (3/5)- nothing special, annoying main riff  11.My Friend Of Misery (2.5/5)- too slow, I hate the opening bassline it kills the song for me  12.The Struggle Within (3/5)- pretty good    If you like softer metal, or hard rock than buy this album.    If you liked this album youll probably also like:  Megadeth- Countdown To Extinction  Soundgarden- Superunknown  Nirvana- Nevermind  Helmet- Meantime  Alice In Chains- Dirt
B0000CAXIC|5.0|ok...i know people say this album is really commercial for the foo fighters   but listen.....if someone likes it alot and more people start to like it   what is wrong with that........In my opinion...and as many as yours....this cd is awesome.....to me the best songs on here...arent even singles.....ok....we all know everlong is a single  but it is one of the best songs....My hero is not really commercial just a really big meaning behind it..*Dave Grohl is talking about Kurt Cobain* if you didnt know that....and one of the best songs of all is Up IN Arms........Foo Fighters is a great band...and always will be throguh the ups and downs    so....i give this album a 5/5......for being one the inspirational meanings of my life right now.... <br /> <br />-KASEY
B00005JNTZ|5.0|WARNING:  SPOILERS!<br /><br />The 2004-2005 will hopefully go down as one of the most important seasons in recent television history, not because there was such a plethora of great new series-there weren't-but because it was the beginning of the end of the dominance of reality programming and the rebirth of the scripted television show.  The two shows that are getting most of the credit for the sudden demise of the reality show are the two mega-hits on ABC, LOST and DESPERATE HOUSEWIVES, but I hope that UPN's lovely VERONICA MARS will get at least some credit.  If LOST and VERONICA MARS are the face of things to come, rather than WIFE SWAP or THE SWAN, then the future for TV could be very bright indeed.<br /><br />Of all the series that were developed in the wake of BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER, VERONICA MARS hues most closely to the original (especially in Buffy's high school years) and is one of the best.  [October 2005 addition:  VERONICA MARS in its second season is highlighting the ties to BUFFY not merely by bringing BUFFY regular Alyson Hannigan back for a brief appearance, but having Charisma Carpenter as a semi-regular and BUFFY creator Joss Whedon as a guest star in one episode in November.  Salon.com did its part by awarding this years Buffy Award, for the best show on TV neglected by the Emmys--and named for the Best Show ever ignored by the Emmys--to VERONICA MARS.]  If we were to describe the original recipe for the show, it is about 50% BUFFY, 20% NANCY DREW, 15% BEVERLY HILLS 90210, and 15% TWIN PEAKS.  In other words, the show is about a super cable blonde high school student who takes on do-badders and tilts the scales of justice, who is an amateur female sleuth, whose escapades all take play in her upper class high school with a contingent of working class students, and who in her spare time investigates the mystery of the death of her best friend Laura Palmer . . . er, ah, I mean Lily Kane.<br /><br />At the start of the series, Veronica can look back at a very bad year.  Her best friend died; her father, the former sheriff, was fired because of disapproval of his handling of the investigation; her boyfriend, Duncan Kane, and the brother of the deceased Lily, has broken up with her; because of her father's firing and the snubbing of her by Duncan and his friends, the formerly popular Veronica finds herself ostracized by her fellow students, especially after her drugging and rape at a party provide her with the label of being a party girl (all expressed by the superb theme song \\"We Used to Be Friends\\" by The Dandy Warhols); and in the aftermath of her father's firing, her mother mysteriously disappeared and hasn't been seen or heard from in months.  But Veronica is nothing if not resilient, and she is not one to passively take the misfortunes that life heaps upon one.  In other words, she has spunk, as well as a quick and inventive wit and lifetime supply of street smarts.  Upon being made ex-sheriff, her father sets up as a private detective, and Lily serves both as his receptionist and aide, and ends up having a bit of a practice at school once her reputation as one who can resolve awkward situations begins to spread.  By the end of the season one might find Veronica struggling with three mysteries at once, the ongoing one of Lily's death, as well as whatever her father is working on, and some friend at school.<br /><br />All in all, I found the first season to be thoroughly fascinating and persistently entertaining.  The structure of the narrative is a bit of a blend of the long-story-arc episode and the stand-alone episode.  Each episode will move the core story for that episode forward, while also taking up any of a number of the ongoing mysteries.  And there are a host of mysteries.  For instance, we wonder about who are the biological parents of who, whether the have been inadvertent incestuous relationships, and characters who run away to escape the difficulties.  Through it all it the utterly unflappable Veronica, utterly determined to get at the truth of things.  By the end of the season the big arc for that season-who killed Lily Kane-is solved, thanks to Veronica.<br /><br />Veronica Mars is a great character who is more than aptly handled by the extraordinarily cute Kristen Bell, who is perfect for the role except for the fact that she is a bit too old to be playing a high school junior.  She is so otherwise perfect for the role it is easy to overlook the age gaffe.  Although Veronica is a transparent girl-power heroine in the tradition of BUFFY, she stands apart from other such heroines such as Max Guevara and Sydney Bristow in not having especial super powers or abilities, and has no special mystical destiny.  What is Veronica's special power?  Her quick wit.  That's it!  She just thinks faster than others.  She emerges as both a great strategic and tactical thinker, always two or three steps ahead of everyone else, always anticipating what someone else's response is going to be.  Very rarely is she surprised by someone, or unable to response instantly to a variation.<br /><br />The rest of the characters form a nice and believable group of characters.  They largely fall into the competent and outstanding categories.  In fact, the only three I would not place merely into the competent category are Enrico Colantoni, who is superb as Veronica's dad Keith.  Though they sometimes disagree on things, throughout the show they are obviously the greatest of friends, and when they need to be, great colleagues.  Keith tries to protect his daughter, but he also knows that she is someone of rather prodigious abilities, so he doesn't always try to stand in her way.  He has a great kid, and he knows it.  The only other cast member I think deserves especial notice is Jason Dohring as the mercurial Logan Echolls, who at various times in the course of the season is sadistic, vulnerable, angry, magnanimous, courageous, cruel, tender, grateful, selfish, and romantic.  If you don't like him one week, wait a couple of episodes and reevaluate.  One bit of casting irony should be noted.  Francisco Capra plays Weevil, the head of the local motorcycle gang.  In fact, he is a member of one of the most thoroughly connected families in the history of Hollywood, his great grandfather being the great director Frank Capra, his grandfather one of the great power brokers in Hollywood, and he father nearly as active in a host of tinsel town activities.  So much for his outsider cred.  Nonetheless, Capra, despite being the ultimate Hollywood insider, does a good job as one of the school's bad boys.<br /><br />All in all, this was a great first season, with a great series of storylines, one of the best season-long mysteries to be unraveled in ages, and a group of characters we come to care for.  The show ended with most of the loose ends tied up, probably in part an instance of defensive writing on the part of the production team.  With a bevy of rather shocking cancellations in recent years, a lot of writers decide to end a season as if they were ending the season.  WONDERFALLS is a great example of this.  We are sure to see more.  Thankfully, UPN renewed VERONICA MARS, so we'll get to see the spunky, resourceful, irrepressible high school sleuth back in action for a least one more season, and hopefully for more.  And maybe, just maybe the powers-that-be in Hollywood will realize that this kind of quality scripted television with long story arcs, and not forgettable, cheap, unrehearsed reality shows are what viewers really want.d to get at the truth of things.

B0007TKNIS|2.0|Seriously...what's the big deal? <br />I've never seen the stage show, but I bet it was a whole lot better than the film. I expected to be treated to a fabulous musical, much on the scale of 'Chicago' and 'Moulin Rouge.' Instead, I was treated to an ameatur technical filming of a fabulous set. <br />There are plenty of shots where you can actually see the shadow of the camera, and the editing and photography of certain shots left me confused and dissapointed. <br />The actors are too young, too bland for their roles. The music was overbearing and somewhat annoying. The plot seemed to draw out endlessly, the corpses of the actors didn't help. All of these actors are EXCELLENT actors, but their talent has been wasted on this film. <br />Joel Schumacher too is an excellent director, he just seemed to get lost on this one. <br />The sets and costumes are brilliant, I will say that. They're the only aspect that saved the production. <br />Meanwhile, I respect those that enjoy it so wonderfully, I just don't understand why. <br />
B0006399FS|1.0|how to dismantle an atomic bomb is just a contract album coated in stupid mellow, muted tones that aim for the languid atmospherics of, say, Air, but instead achieve a state of lite-rock somnambulism. The whole album is nothing but a remix of all that you can't leave behind. I can't stand that this \\"new\\" album sounds like a rewrite of its 2000 highly overrated predecessor, which itself was a pulseless way to spend a listening 49 minutes. <br /> <br />I don't know which thing is the most unoriginal: the album or the vertigo tour.  <br /> <br />One thing I'm sure of: They're completely afraid to change and they're not going to really test fans with the kind of fantastic diversion that resulted with Zooropa and POP.  <br /> <br />U2 are now another dated nostalgia act, very uneven for a rock band that defined order and art in the glory 90s. <br />Sellouts. <br />
B0007Z4S4C|5.0|I am so glad that Plant is back! I mean back to great music writing. This is the best album in the last few years. It is more like old 1980s and 1993 albums of Robert Plant, very energetic and melodic. The band is great too, the drums - finally sound like a drums! <br />Great album by Plant and Strange Sensation. Highly recommend it to fans of Led Zeppelin and Robert Plant. I hope to see more album like that from Plant and tour would have been great!  <br />
B00005LW7R|5.0|Verdi's FALSTAFF is an opera that continues to surprise us. Those who associate Verdi with opera's of twisted, nearly indecipherable plots, or tales of death and intrigue, of love gone wrong - all the material that serves as fodder for Verdi's sublimely beautiful, show-stopping arias - usually have a tough time with a Verdi comedy where there are almost no arias that allow for disruptive applause in the storyline.  Yet FALSTAFF (based on the Shakespeare character) is probably one of the most fully integrated, finely written pieces of musical theater in the repertoire.  Rich in characters, glorious orchestral and vocal writing, and some of the finest ensemble music ever written, FALSTAFF is a masterpiece.<br /><br />To make the opera come to life requires a conductor who can mold the gigantic orchestral score from opening to finale, a supporting cast of exceptional singer/actors, and a baritone who can demand stage center at all times.  Many of us felt the old Giulini recording was as fine as they come - until this recording.  Here Claudio Abbado reigns in the Berlin Philharmonic to a note perfect, gorgeous and solid execution of the multifaceted score, romping with the comedy, and creating filigree magic of the forest setting in the final act.<br /><br />Bryn Terfel simply inhabits the title role.  His glorious voice is never anything but beautiful and rich and his comic timing and fully realized portrayal of Falstaff has no rivals. Of course, having the opportunity of seeing him in the current Los Angeles Opera production fleshes out the visuals of his center of the target interpretation! The others in this stunning cast are exemplary, especially Adrianne Pieczonka as Mistress Ford (this is a gifted soprano to watch carefully!) and Thomas Hampson as Ford, and that is mentioning only two.  While Larissa Diadkova as Mistress Quickly may not erase everyone's indelible memory of Regina Resnik's interpretation, these are very negligible (and doubtless personal) asides.<br /><br />The sound is spacious and rich and in every way this recording manages to capture the genius of this comedic magnum opus.  It is a delight!  Grady Harp, May 05des.   <br /> <br />The sound is spacious and rich and in every way this recording manages to capture the genius of this comedic magnum opus.  It is a delight!

B0002IQJUK|5.0|Gavin Degraw is an a true artist in every sense of the word.  You can not get a sense of this when you listen to the over produced Chariot but Stripped the bonus disk is the key to this artist's performance.  You will understand him and what he is all about if you listen to Stripped.  I did.
B0000039LE|5.0|In 1978, director John Carpenter had brought us the one movie that will always be remembered as one of the greatest horror movies ever to be made. That horror film, ladies & gents, is HALLOWEEN.<br /><br />  On October 31st, 1963, Halloween Night, in Haddonfield, Illinois, 6-year-old MICHAEL MYERS had murdered his 17-year-old sister, JUDITH MYERS (played by Sandy Johnson) in cold blood. For the last fifteen years, Michael has been locked up in a sanitarium in Smith's Grove, Illinois. His psychiatrist, DR. SAM LOOMIS (played by Donald Pleasance) has an obsession with his patient<br /><br />  On October 30, 1978, now at the age of 21, MICHAEL MYERS (played by Nick Castle) is about to be taken to court, where he is now going to be tried for the murder of his older sister. On his way to the Smith's Grove Sanitarium to pick up Michael, is Dr. Loomis, with the help of NURSE MARION CHAMBERS (played by Nancy Stephens). They pull up to the main gate, as Dr. Loomis steps out of the car. After he steps out of the car, Michael attacks Marion and almost kills her. But she gets out of the car safely, as Michael jumps in and drives off.<br /><br />  Halloween morning has arrived. Back in Haddonfield, Illinois, the young and beautiful, LAURIE STRODE (played by Jamie Lee Curtis) is 17-years-old and on her way to school. Before she goes on her way to school, she has to drop off a key at a nearby house, in which her father is selling. That house is...The Myers House. On her way to the Myers house, the 8-year-old TOMMY DOYLE (played by Brian Andrews) comes along to walk with Laurie. Laurie is Tommy's babysitter, so he and Laurie are pretty good friends. Laurie will be babysitting little Tommy tonight. They walk on to the scene of the crime. Laurie drops the key off, as Tommy goes on his way to school, as Laurie is on her way.<br /><br />  Dr. Loomis knows that Michael is traveling back to Haddonfield to kill again, which is why he must go there and stop him before it's too late. Dr. Loomis makes a pit stop and calls the Haddonfield police to be ready for when Michael enters, but the police are no help. He finds a nearby garage truck, with Michael's hospital robes shredded into pieces, as well as the dead owner lying around nearby. The owner of the truck has been stripped of his clothing. Michael is now wearing the owner's clothes.<br /><br />  That afternoon, Laurie is leaving school with her two best friends: LYNDA (played by PJ Soles) and ANNIE (played by Nancy Loomis). They live in the same neighborhood together. As they walk, Michael rides by in the car he stole from Dr. Loomis, to which Annie shouts out a joke to him, but Michael isn't laughing. He drives off, with the wheels of brain turning, in which he will do to Annie when he gets the chance. They make to Lynda's house, to which she enters, leaving Annie and Laurie. As they walk on, Laurie sees Michael and realizes he is the one that drove by with Annie yelling at him. Annie walks up to the bush in which Michael stood, but he's gone. Annie thinks Laurie maybe losing it, as she enters her house. There, Laurie says a quick hello to LEIGH BRACKETT (played by Charles Cyphers), Annie's father, as well as Sheriff of Haddonfield.<br /><br />  Laurie returns home and goes into her bedroom. She stands at her bedroom and sees Michael again in her neighbor's backyard. He soon disappears, scaring the hell out of Laurie, where she suddenly gets a phone call, where the caller on the other end is chewing. Laurie, hangs up in fright, for she thinks it is a crank caller. The phone rings again and it turns out to be Annie, who called the first time.<br /><br />  As Laurie and Annie arrive at their destinations, Dr. Sam Loomis has already entered Haddonfield and has met Brackett, where they are entering the Myers home, where Dr. Loomis investigates the place since Judith's murder.<br /><br />  Back at the Doyle house, Laurie and Tommy are watching the horror cult classing, THE THING, where a little while ago, Tommy had thought he had seen Michael, who every kid calls, THE BOOGEYMAN. Laurie tries so hard to convince him that there is no such thing, where the two head off into the kitchen to carve a Jack O'Lantern. At the Doyle house, Annie was making popcorn for her and Lindsey, but Annie heads off to the laundry room to wash her clothes, since she soaked them with butter. She washes her clothes and gets a call from her boyfriend, Paul, where she drops Lindsey off at Tommy's house.<br /><br />  Annie gets in her car only to be killed by Michael. A few hours later, while after putting Lindsey and Tommy to bed, Laurie sits around, waiting for Annie to call her. As that is happening, Lynda and her boyfriend, BOB (played by John Michael Graham) pull up in front Lindsey's house. They suspect Annie took Lindsey out somewhere, while Lynda and Bob head upstairs to have sex.<br /><br />  As Bob heads downstairs to the kitchen for some beers, Michael kills him off. Michael heads upstairs, wearing a white sheet, with Bob's glasses over that, pretending to Bob. Lynda calls Laurie to see if she heard from Annie, but as Laurie answers the phone, Michael strangles Lynda to death with the phone cord. Laurie heads over to Lindsey's house only to find the dead bodies of her friends. Michael finds her, slices Laurie's left arm and sends her on a horrifying chase. Laurie reaches Tommy's house and realizes she lost the keys. She wakes up Tommy and Lindsey, who let her in. Tommy and Lindsey lock themselves in Tommy's room, while Laurie stabs Michael in the neck with her sewing needle.<br /><br />  (...)<br /><br />  HALLOWEEN had scared the everloving sh*t out of millions of people around the world and it set a huge box office record. This film is so original in its own unique way and fans of the horror genre will continue to enjoy this film forever and always.very kid calls, THE BOOGEYMAN.

THIS ALBUM RULES!!!!!!!!!!!! <br /> <br />                     Signed, J.G. ... ENJOY!
B00000K3CM|2.0|I really enjoyed Home Alone 1.  It was very creative and a fun, family holiday movie, with a lot of laughs.  The second one had such potential, but they ruined it in so many ways.  First of all, he isn't Home Alone, so the title alone is ridiculously incorrect.  He is accidently in NY while his family is searching for him.  Everything is so repetitive-from eating ice cream while watching movies, to the pranks he plays on the villains.  What I noticed most was the furniture in his hotel room.  It is from the house set of the first movie!  Look at the 4 poster bed, the tv, the tables, even the lamp and the decorations around the fireplace.  After all the money they made on the first movie, they couldn't even purchase new props?  Stick with the first movie-this one is just a remake with a lot of bad choices.  No charm, whatsover.  I gave it 2 stars for keeping the same cast and the lovely scene of the toy store.  But those 2 things are not worth the movie, itself.
B00025ETIW|3.0|My main complaint is that even though the album obviously addresses a certain storyline, the tracks really sound WAY too homogenous--and really not in a good way.  These guys don't really have a well developed sense of style or unique sound beyond hyper-fast and cheap dynamic extreme tricks, which leads to complaint no. 2:    (...) I find it a chore to listen to just 3 songs in a row... like 8 minutes.  Maybe I'm just too mellow in my ripe old age of can't-yet-buy-a-drink, but when they can't hold of the inevitable screaming more than 20, sometimes 30 (and i think at one point even 40--amazing) seconds into the track to generate excitement, something tells me they're lacking in songwriting skills.    I would understand if you found this album entertaining once through, but it hardly warrants repeat listens, even with a couple decent tracks.
B00003CX95|5.0|I feel sorry for everyone who rated this movie with 4 and less stars, they miss out on the enjoyment of one of the best movies ever.
B000929AJQ|5.0|When I auditioned the album online before its release, I was thrown off balance for a while and couldn't believe I was hearing this out of the 'Fragile' man.  Then again, six years is a long time.  Anyway, I figure a lot of the backlash is mostly because people were imposing their own personal expectations on TRs creativity... I was just hoping for something daring and good, which is what I think he has always done.    This album features a much more at-peace and mature Reznor, toning down (relatively) on the emotional explosions and instead focusing on just writing damn good music, and it is a rock solid 56 minutes of music.  There's plenty of unsubtle social commentary, but plenty of excellent lyrical satire and completely natural irony and heartfelt compassion in the lyrics, especially in \\"Right Where it belongs\\"--he's not sad about his life anymore, he's sad about yours (and in several tracks he sings from 'your' complacent shoes).  One gesture in the track is especially poignant if you think back to the track \\"the downward spiral\\" when the opposite effect accompanies a shift into the narration about how \\"he\\" killed himself.      As for all the complaints that its all rehashing his older stuff, they're pretty off the mark, I think.  His melodic style is definitely a forward step from 'the Fragile', and by stripping down his ensemble to its live-performance essentials, he's given his voice more room to shine, and he sounds better here than any of his previous work.  He does a great job with the 'sprechstimme' (speech-singing), especially on 'Only' where he obviously put thought into making such a long non-melodic passage work rhythmically and texturally--its a totally infectious song, even though I burst out laughing the first time I heard it.  He's not just imitating a retro style like so many bands try, he's integrating it into his own music and making it work in the context of his own style.  That takes skill.    In short, its different than previous work, very cool, and VERY good.
B000068OSK|5.0|If your into progressive rock and drum solos then go listen to that and leave the white stripes alone.  You can throw around your generic completely unfounded insults all you want but I'm going to trust Bob Dylan's, Loretta Lynn's, The Rolling Stones' and Jeff Beck's word that this is great band.
B000000WA4|3.0|OK, the songs which got a lot of play on the radio back in the day were in fact the handful of good songs on this hulking album.  To their credit, some of these songs are quite good and I like them... but the rest of the album is so inconsistent and not up to snuff with those good tracks which were sadly anomalies.  In this case, the songs which were not well suited for radio play were really not suited for any play in general and leave me bored with a bad aftertaste. I tried to get into it, but I couldn't--and believe me, I listen to plenty of bloated long albums and pieces of music which are far more successful than this one.   <br />The title is also a bit ridiculous, if you ask me.
B0002858YS|4.0|as disappointed as i am at the mainstream-ness the killers have became, with the ever radioplay the voyeurism Mr. Brightside gets, and ironically indie music is now played alongside popular music in HMV stores and MTV....i still have to declare the killers rock. <br />with the current retro vintage revival craze, everyone jumps onto the 'obscure' indie bandwagon - look how successful the new york Strokes got! but like many bands nowadays, the killers mix several genres into their songs, attracting more fans from a variety of genre like rock,techno,electronica,indie & pop- punk. <br /> <br /> Just listen to the lovely SOMEBODY TOLD ME - electronica fuses into rock and halfway part techno. adding to the fact that the lyrics are exceptional and absolutely relating - how many couples i have seen whose boyfriends indeed resemeble girlfriends than boyfriends (though how stereotypical it sounds, its less than constantly rapping about falling in and out of bloody love) <br /> <br />and Mr Brightside. a song full of jealousy, implusiveness and envy. how many people i knew could relate to it. the guitar playing at the beginning seem to evoke a sense of inevitability and regret no other recent song has been able to. <br /> <br />similarly, songs like Andy, You're a Star and All These Things that I've Done from Lead singer's throaty echo-ing singing reminds you of times far away, and a dark room full of mod lights and plush dusty cushions.  <br /> <br />The best thing about the Killers is that they are rock you can dance to. and yet not quite yet rock. and weirdly with odd connotations that you can still relate to.  <br /> <br />the only thing i regret about the Killers is em going mainstream...just when i thought i discovered yet another lovely indie band.
B000002NBY|5.0|Maybe its just nostalgia or something because my dad used to play this a lot when I was growing up (my bros and I were fascinated by the clear cassette tape), but this album is still refreshing and good even though I'm young enough that I can't remember I time I'd not heard this album.   <br />I hope this album finds plenty of fans among my generation as well.
B000060P79|2.0|no doubt i have joined the ranks of those who proclaim simple plan a skunk band than punk band... at the age of 18 and my music tastes has since transitted to that of classic rockbands and obscure indie bands.  <br /> <br />when i was 14 (going through those lame-o transitions phrases), simple plan was THE band and part of the \\"punk\\" revivial of the 2000s...unfortunately they ARE pop in the facade appeal of punkrockers to appeal to the young disgruntled youths..of let's say..age 8 to 15.  <br /> <br />however, when i was 14 this cd meant everything and was especially relevant in the going-ons in life.  <br />songs like I'm Just a Kid (yeah life is a nightmare, i'm just a kid, yeah life's not fair) has a Malcolm in the Middle tinge to it, sorta reminds you of the time when you thought snapping girl's bra straps were cool and just cuz your mom didn't give you any pocket money, life ain't fair.  <br /> <br />Songs like; The Worst Day Ever and God Must Hate Me; is perfect for those rainy friday nights when all your buddies are out with their new girlfriends at some ice-cream store and your at home watching HBO or playing computer games.  <br /> <br />My Alien is pure silly and reminds me of my terrier humping basically.. (4 legs to wrap around...she knows when something's wrong...) <br /> <br />Perfect with its huge radioplay should also appeal to the young teens who all claim to be misunderstood. <br /> <br />the album's for pure fun really. for those parties where your friends are all mainstream and think classic rock is noise, for the middle line between not falling to britney/a1/westlife type pop.....compromise and go 'pop-skunk'. like simple plan. i wouldn't even call them punk and the word punk is getting too heavy with every single newbies jumping on its bandwagon. <br /> <br /> <br />otherwise. skip this album. you won't enjoy it and at the constantly broke age of 18 attempt to hide it below your dad's bryan adams and metallica albums, hoping guests who come over do not spot it...and dream about how you could spent the $16 from the simple plan cd wiser.  <br />cuz that's what i do.
B000784WMW|5.0|Watching this miniseries, I couldn't help be struck by how these 19th century characters behaved in a more realistic fashion than a lot of the modern characters in current movies. While they are bound by social rules and live in circumstances far removed from those of our present society, they react to those circumstances in a credible way.<br /><br />Since I'm not a great fan of Bronte novels, I attribute my reaction to how well-acted and written this miniseries is. Given the type of dialog, it's a tribute to Timothy Dalton and Zelah Clarke's acting. They deliver their lines, lines that could easily sound phony or affected, from the heart.<br /><br />There are only a few small problems with this miniseries but they do not detract in any measurable way from the viewers' enjoyment. First, there is fluctuation between video (for interior scenes) and film (for outside scenes) which can be a bit disconcerting, particularly when you're immersed in the story and not really thinking about the fact that you're watching T.V. Second, Timothy Dalton really is too attractive to be Rochester. This isn't an especially great problem except for a scene where Rochester asks Jane if she finds him handsome and she immediately answers \\"no\\". This makes Jane seem insincere or ridiculously modest when this is certainly not what is meant. Had they cut that line, Dalton's attractiveness wouldn't be an issue. He certainly was well cast for his acting ability. He is superb as Rochester, and I say that as someone who isn't especially a fan of his.<br /><br />If you're a fan of this type of genre, you can't help but be thoroughly pleased by this version. Purchasing the DVD is something you will not regret.
B00008OLYN|1.0|I am new-comer to Amazon, but not good music. <br /> <br />I thought it was a great idea that other peoples reviews and recommendations(to include amazon.com's) may lead me to new  <br />exciting music similiar to my taste. Tt is a big world, right? <br /> <br />Well I was lead to this piece of garbage for an album! <br /> <br />I really cant express in words how horrible this album is <br />so i'll just say i broke the cd in half with my bare hands! <br /> <br />it gave me more gratitude to break the cd than to re-sell it! <br /> <br />I guess I can lead out this review by saying. If you psuedo-intlectual wanna-be's that cannot immediately find something <br />entertaining about a cd don't analyze it untill you can come <br />up with enough material to justifiy giving them 5 stars.
B00082IJ08|5.0|This album ripped fine using WMP 10. I dont know why other reviewers are having trouble.  <br /> <br />As far as the music itself, it is a wonderful album. The loss of Dan and Del seemed a little disappointing, but Danger Mouse has done a fine job filling in. It sounds different, and darker than their first album, but if anything the songs are alot more catchier.  <br /> <br />Favorite tracks: <br />DARE  <br />Last Living Souls <br />Feel Good Inc.  <br />
B00004XMV6|5.0|The movie touches me each time I see it. Kim Basinger is at the top of her game, irresistible; Mickey Rourke is mesmerizing. Nothing is left to chance in 9  Weeks. The photography is remarkable. Everything is close and simple. It is a very intimate movie in the way it was shot, with a story in which each of us should find a familiar sense of the questions we have about love and sex, passion and fantasies, true love and cruel love. <br />A beautiful forever modern movie. <br />
B00005JNBQ|4.0|I wanted to watch this because everyone said it was funny. So I watched it and it was funny! This movie is totally random! <br /> <br />now I took one star off beacuse it was boring which is why some people hate it. But it's boring because it's a plotless movie! theres no point whatsoever! it's just a random movie. It does center around napolian obviousely. It was a funny movie though.
0761129235|5.0|The philosophy of small can produce big results.  The topic of this book is how the big things in your life, your business, your relationships are really no more than a series of very small things.  The key to change is the ability to make the minute course corrections over time, not big changes all at once.<br /><br />The book starts with some great examples of how our mindset typically works when faced with major change or obstacles.  We freeze.  We are unable to grasp the enormity of what is required and therefore have less likelihood of success.  The strategy is then in breaking the situation down to smaller segments and executing them.  For example, anyone can exercise three minutes a day.  Now by itself this won't change your life, but what if three turns into ten, ten into twenty, twenty into thirty?  Now major change is underway.<br /><br />The other essential element to this approach is the ability to understand root causes.  This is a critical step in any Quality effort in business, but is also just as relevant and perhaps more important in life.  Start by asking small questions.  These will eventually lead to the root or core issues to be addressed.<br /><br />The other sections lead from these basic premises.  Take small actions, for example.  Once the problem or change desired is broken down into smaller segments, don't try to change all at once.  Take small steps and watch them grow.  I think a big reason this is so difficult to do, is that many of us hard charging type-A types lack the patience to allow change to happen through the one step at a time mindset, and want to rush it all at once.  We do so often with faster results that over time achieve less, and therefore in the end are in fact slower than if we were patient to begin with.<br /><br />I found this book to be very enlightening.  It presents wisdom that is common sense, yet rarely acted upon.  I have tried several of the techniques and found them to be very helpful.  I recommend this book highly.  A small investment that could pay off in a big way.his book highly.  A small investment that could pay off in a big way. <br />
074325144X|5.0|I didn't know how to post a question, so I gave it five stars because it sounds good. But I'm just wondering, has anyone been able to use this book to return from running after shin splints. I've had them for 8 months and am dying to run again. Can anyone answer my question?
B0007TKNIS|4.0|The costumes and sets are excellent, the voices are excellent, and i got chills all over the whole time. \\"Point of No Return\\" is my favorite song, closely followed by \\"Wishing You Were Somehow Here Again\\".  <br /> <br />A few complaints, though: <br />-Emmy's voice is gorgeous, but her acting is horrendous. Her face is like wax the whole time and never, ever moves. <br /> <br />-Christine and Meg's exchange during \\"Angel of Music\\" is awkward and seems contrived. <br /> <br />-Raoul looks like a pouf with his curling-ironed hair. A cute pouf, but a pouf nonetheless. <br /> <br />If not for Emmy Rossen's acting, this would receive 5 stars from me. My imaginary 9 year old sister could act better than her.
B0001YRVN4|5.0|I have read several reviews, and I must say that there's a lot of whining going on. I'm only 16, so I haven't see the original versions of the movies as much as the revised versions, but I like the newer versions. First of all, most of the changes made make sense. For example, inserting Hayden Christiansen in the final scene of \\"Jedi\\" is good because that is what Anakin looks like in the prequels, not that older person that was replaced. Another example: putting Ian McDiarmid in as the emperor in \\"Empire Strikes Back.\\" Why does it make sense...oh, well, because he does play the emperor in every other movie that the emperor is in, so having the other actor in \\"Empire Strikes Back\\" just threw the viewer off once the prequels were released. Even without the prequels, McDiarmid is the emperor in \\"Jedi.\\" Second, if you don't like the enhanced digital picture and 5.1 Dolby sound, then you're living in the past way too much. It makes the movies so much better. But even more than that, it helps the original trilogy catch up a little bit with the prequels, in terms of picture and sound quality.  <br /> <br />Personally, these movies have only gotten better in my view. The changes have helped make the overall story more understandable. And yes, I still don't love that musical scene in Jabba's Palace very much, but the other alterations make sense. Plus, the bonus footage is really cool. <br /> <br />In short, these new DVD's really enhance the great story and overall product that is Star Wars. And, if you haven't seen \\"Sith,\\" you absolutely must! Outstanding!
B0002S943O|5.0|Absolutely enjoyable concert performance by Depeche Mode.  Dave Gahan looks like he is really enjoying this show and singing his heart out for the fans.  The version of \\"Policy of Truth\\" is smoking!  Non-Depeche Mode fans (how could you be?) would also really enjoy this dvd.  A stellar performance!
B000002H33|5.0|I'm not so sure that this is Metallica's best album, but it sure is a classic.  Its hard to tell which metallica album is the best because all of their 80s' stuff is awesome.  The album stays pretty heavy.  Although I don't like instrumentals that much, Orion is an exception.  I noticed this other dude that posted a  review said that The Call of Ktulu is better.  I really couldn't say anything like that.  Orion has more going on than The Call of Ktulu.  Orion is much better.  I think the only thing wrong with this album is the fact the some of the lyrics just dont fit the music, that's only true for one song.  The lyrics to Dispoable Heroes should of been for a slow song like Fade To Black.  I think anyone should get this because of the music and the inspiration from it.  Anyone would like this album.  No one couldn't dis-like it. <br /> <br />Battery- slow opener that turns into raw madness. <br />Master Of Puppets- Starts off fast and ends fast and heavy. Pure madness <br />The Thing That Should Not Be- Starts off slow and all of a sudden.. a big guitar comes in and blows it up. Another madness track. <br />Welcome Home (Sanitarium)- The best song on the album.  Starts of soft and builds up.  Great lyrics. <br />Disposable Heroes- Music and lyrics dont match but other then that, great song. <br />Leper Messiah- Has a cool opener... If you heard the part afterDave Mustaine says \\"I wonder will she find out.. about the other, other lover.. Diana\\" off of Wake Up Dead, It sounds like that music wise.  Totally different other then that. Great song. <br />Orion- Great instrumental even though I don't like them.  It has a lot of harmony. <br />Damage, Inc- An o.k. closer.  pretty heavy. <br /> <br />So what are you waiting for.. BUY THIS! <br />would highly appreciate a 'helpful or not' responce.
B000002L9J|5.0|I still remember hearing this album in my early teens and being blown away by the incredible guitar playing a la Johnny Marr and the witty lyrics of Morrissey. A masterpiece of an album! I'm in my thirties now, but I still love this album - it really rocks! I've always believed the Smiths were the next great band after the Beatles. They really inspired the true alternative movement. Buy this album as you will not be disappointed.
B000002H2H|5.0|This is one of Metallica's best and probably falls just a little short to ...And Justice For All.  The opener starts off sorta slow and builds up to be a sorta fly-bye song.  Fight Fire With Fire is personally not my favorite song on the album.  It's the worst for me.  But it's still really good.  The sound is just not for me.  The next track is one of my favorites of all time.  Its starts off fast and ends fast.  This is of course Ride The Lightning.  Its the 2nd best song on the album.  I know you know the best song.  Its coming up.  The next track is called For Whom The Bell Tolls.  This is a live favorite.  It starts off with ringing of bells and serious distorted guitars.  The drums come in strong.  The song ends by fading out. Its pretty good.  The best song has finally arrived.  It is of course Fade To Black.  This is probably my 2nd fav song of all of songs in metallica history.  My fav of all time is One.  I find this song very sad but in a good way.  The guitar riff is amazing.  It starts off slow and mid-way, you hear bursting-loud guitars.  By the end its fading out while a solo is going on.  I think this is one of the worst endings in history.  Come on, I mean.. why not just finish the solo and end or fade out with the drums leading.  That makes more sense to me.  But this ending went down in history, and cant change it, so be happy about it.  The lyrics are the best on the album.  Anyone who doesn't agree is crazy.  The next song is Trapped Under Ice.  It opens up strong.  And stays strong.  The solo is amazing.  It ends with a final drum beat.  The next song is called Escape.  I read other reviews and noticed that people thought this was easily the worst song.  I beg to differ.  I really think this song is good.  Its better then anything off of the later albums, not saying they were bad albums.[ By the way, i'm gonna post reviews for every metallica album asap]  Escape has good guitar parts in it.  It has a sorta poppy metal sound to it.  The next song is about a time in our world history (so they say) when god or jesus sent that big disease sorta like thing and kill all new born babies.  I dont read the bible so wouldn't know exactly.  From this perspective.. the song doesn't make much sense to me.  I still think its a great song.  The guitars are great in this one.  The final song is called The Call of Ktulu.  Not much to say about this one.  Its an instrumental.  I would rate this one lower then Fight Fire With Fire, but the guitars are quite awesome.  I just dont like instrumentals.  <br />****** overall, i would give this album 10 out of 10 stars.  Its quite the album and beats Megadeth's Killing Is My Business... And Business is Good.... I will post that review asap.  I can tell you right now.. if your debating whether to go for Metallica or Megadeth.. I got a solution.   Metallica's 80s' albums surpasses Megadeth's 80s' album by just a tad... but when it comes to the 90s', Megadeth takes the lead.  I hope this helps in more than one way.  Would highly appreciate a good 'helpful or not' decision.
B000001FK3|5.0|I was lucky enough to live in a town when I was a kid that had a great radio station.  No top 40, just great music.  Exposed me to a lot of music that nobody else played.  I was lucky enough to hear songs off of this album, bought it when it first came out, and then saw him in concert!  He was great, and I was amazed that he was playing a cheap banged-up Harmony guitar, just like I had bought at Sears for about $50 (yeah, you could buy guitars at Sears back then).  I saw him on a concert tape or tv years later, and he was still playing that old guitar.   <br /> <br />Just saw him on the \\"Crossroads Guitar Festival\\" DVD.  I would get this album and that DVD.
B000002V0Q|5.0|This is by far one of the best Megadeth albums.  Its sorta the end of a era of awesome metal too.  Not only for Megadeth but also for other bands.  As you may know, this came out in 92'.  I think that played a role in why it was so good.  Anyone whos anyone should add this to their collection, and if you are new to Megadeth, should start with this album.  Its an album with few or no errors.  I listen to it time to time, but everytime I discover new sounds or 'hidden' guitar parts.  I recommend this album to everyone.  Even if you listen to Britney Spears, pick this up.  You wont be dissapointed.  While not as great as some of their earlier work, its still a classic and should take up some space on your shelf. <br />
B00097DX3U|4.0|I'd like to begin by writing that this whole \\"Audioslave have finally come together and 'congealed' as a band\\" crap (see Amazon review) has to go.<br /><br />When Audioslave released their debut, it wasn't the music that was the problem, it was the RATM and SG fans' unwillingness to accept Audioslave as anything but \\"RATM+SG\\". Now that a few years have passed, those listeners have warmed up to the idea that Chris Cornell and Rage could actually jam together (and make music that surpasses nearly all other contemporary music being made) and be a \\"real\\" band. Suddenly, Audioslave are a \\"bona fide\\" group, and their music sounds better. I say bullsh*t. More like, Audioslave have been awesome all along, and some people were just too perplexed, obstinate or stupid to notice.<br /><br />Okay, with that said--this album might just save us all. In a time when rock music is recovering from the likes of Creed, and still suffering through the crappy hangers-on like Nickelback, Audioslave is a bright, shining star. Meaningful lyrics and incredible music--such a logical combination, but sadly so absent in music these days.<br /><br />I'm not going to do a song-by-song critique, because frankly, no one cares what I think. However, I will say that this is the type of soulful, mournful, hopeful music that you can feel in your marrow. You don't just hear it--you feel it. And you're sure to take it with you when it's over.
B000002H6C|5.0|This album came out in 1988.  Megadeth's So Far, So Good...So What! came out the same year.  I'm gonna review that but for now gonna do .. And Justice For All.  This is the first album without cliff.  Although the death of cliff is very depressing because he had such potential,he was sorta the Jimmy Page of Basses, I'm not sure this album would of been so successful without the death.  This album holds one of the greatest songs of all time.  It makes you wanna cry but when you listen to the music.. you dont wanna cry.. you wanna suck it up and have a good time and bang ya head.  Thats what metal is all about.  ...And Justice For All proved that sad songs can make you headbang.  The best song on this album and also the main highlight is One.  This is my all-time favorite Metallica song.  Its sorta like Megadeth's In My Darkest Hour as far as music structure goes.. but One is written better.  As you may know.. its based on a movie about a landmine taking everything away from a man.  I never saw the movie.. but according to the lyrics. he lived.. he had to face living with no arms, no legs, and worst of all no soul.  Metallica proved that they could make a song out of nothing.  Other highlights would be Dyers Eve.. This is about neglection.  This is the 2nd best song on the album.  Really good stuff.  The rest of the songs are ok.  I really wouldn't know what to say if i had to review the songs.. but i can tell you that they are awesome.. and make the album a lil better than Ride The Lightning, and you gotta know that that's pretty hard to accomplish.  I highly recommend this album.  The same for Ride The Lightning.
B000002LGA|5.0|New York (1989) tells the story about life in New York City.  A<br /><br />dark and depressing album with a light at the end of the tunnel.  Lou Reed expresses his deep affection for his beloved city with moving lyrics and carefully structured guitar<br /><br />riffs, solos and a fantastic rhythm section.  Maureen Tucker and Dion make special apperances on this disc.  Finally, a truthful look at the eighties like it truly was.  Beneath all the excess and glitter, life was terrible for the masses.  This winner was followed up by another equally great (and dark and dreary) album.<br /><br />Highly recommended. Endless Cycle, X-mas in Februray and Romeo had Juliet are some of the best tracks on this disc.
B00000JKH2|5.0|Welll.... Yea.. This band in general si.. SO FRIGGIN GREAT.. lol.. I notice I dont usually say much about the musci itself.. becuase I dont know much about those things.. but I DO know what sounds good.. and what has great lyrics.. adn THIS MY FRIENDS... falls under that category.
B0002OERI0|5.0|so this is wat i call music .i simply can't beleive a band to come up with such an album after a period of 10+ years or so from their first album. this albm is very fresh and energetic and is definitly more than \\"dookie\\". i catagorised this album on the basis of the type of songs..lets go <br /> <br />intro:  <br />             'american idot' is a perfect song to start with . it has some bold lyrics and great guitar riffs .though we've heared this song so many times it is worth listening over and over. <br /> <br />10+ min songs: <br />              there are two songs 'jesus of suburbia ' and 'home comming' of which 'jesus...' is my favourite .its the greatest lengthy song ive ever heared .there is a popular scenario in the pop music called 'fugue' its like the pace and tempo of the song suddenly changes from the current tempo for a period of time and returns to the parent tempo ( u can listen a perfect fugue in the track 'morphine' in michael jacksons 'blood on dance floor') but wat we hear in this song is a collection of fugues which is a never done before concept. i this track i like 'i dont care' and 'dearly beloved ' subtrack. reg the other track 'home comming' according to me is a filler perhaps the second longest filler after judas priests 'lochness' hey don't get me wrong this is a great track but comparitively it lacks a bit .if u hear this song in the first place u will definitly love it. <br /> <br />ballads: <br />              unlike the previous green days album this album is rife with instantly memorable melodies such as 'Boulevard Of Broken Dreams' 'Give Me Novacaine ' 'Extraordinary Girl ''Wake Me Up When September Ends ''watsername' of which boulevard...is a superb song and its ma favourite  billys voice is amazing .its a very disturbing song .i really liked the track 'gimme novacine .its disturbing too where billy says 'gimme  novacine so that i  can forget ma pains'the tempo is great and this song is really soothing same with the case of 'wakeme up..' and watsername is the last track of the album, a great song to complete. <br /> <br />green day songs:  <br />                 songs like 'st jimmy' and 'she's a rebel' 'letter bomb' sounds very  energetic and aggressive  and reminds us of the old green day songs .tracks 'on holiday' and 'are we we are' are  great songs and it sounds like 'sum 41's. <br /> <br />overall ma favourite songs in this album are  <br />American Idiot ,Jesus of Suburbia ,Boulevard Of Broken Dreams ,Give Me Novacaine ,Extraordinary Girl ,Wake Me Up When September Ends and whatsername.
0553345834|5.0|It's an easy reader. It offers some valuable tips from this guy who has more money than me, right? He says things like \\"middle managers make the HUGE mistake of knowing what they shouldn't say and saying it anyway\\"; I used to do that. \\"Laughter in intense situations is key\\"; I made the whole group crack up at a corporate training. \\"Timing is everything so be aware of the benefit to you in timing\\". I'm paraphrasing of course but I love this book. I took notes, I highlighted, I memorized. I read it often and if I lost it I'd buy another. It's fun. Worth the money and the time.
B00006879E|4.0|this band became extremely popular mainly because of the track 'she will be loved 'that track alone pushed the band to the superstardom status. but what about the rest of the tracks ..well according to me this album reminds me of the earlier britney spears albums which used to have a powerful single and a collection of fillers .certainly though this album dont have such fillers the other tracks lacks a bit comparitively.. the track 'she will be loved is simply superb, lyrics are awfull and tear provoking AND IT JUST drives the album. tracks 'hard to breath' ,'this love' through with you' 'not commin'are excellent 'sunday morning' and 'shiver' are kinda ok ..certainly a good effort but not a great effort ..the best tracks of the album are (acc to me)     1. she will be loved      2. harder to breath     3. this love      4.not commin  as long as u love 'she will be loved '...maroon5 will be loved
0767817478|1.0|This movie that I refere to as G.I.N.O is terrible.  The directors were trying to make a Godzilla movie and they failed.  That thing was not Godzilla.  The only similarity was that they called it Godzilla.  The monster could run up to 200 mph but only used its speed to run away from helicopters!  The real Godzilla wouldn't have done that.  Plus, its head was real differant and its spikes were all weird looking.  Also, I could easily tell that Gino was a CGI creature.  In other words, poor CGI.  The main story was really dumb.  Gino lays a nest and all the babies hatch.  It should have been more like battle another monster in order to be a Godzilla movie <br /> <br />SPOILER: In the end the stupid iguana died because six missiles hit him!  Then the heart beating scene was a terrible rip-off from King Kong. <br /> <br />Overall this movie BOMBED!  The DVD was okay, the special features were just not very good accept for the Featurett.  If you're looking for a Godzilla movie then this is not one of them. <br />
B00005JCAA|5.0|Every frame of this film is beautiful.  It has the look and feel of a Merchant/Ivory film.  The musical score is by Thomas Newman.  He is my favorite modern composer.  I can hear his reverence for the piano.  I can't watch this film without crying no matter how many times I see it.  I agree with another reviewer: a favorite scene is when Anthony Hopkins describes how he came to like cold lamb sandwiches.  It took great care for this film to take something so simple and give it such depth and richness.  If you like love stories, you'll like this film.  If you like fantasy, you'll like this film.  Because sadly, love and fantasy are so often synonymous.
B000022TSW|5.0|A lot of big time shows have to do the eventual movie. The then-popular Ninja Turtles actually had 3(!) real life adaptations, Spongebob had one, Powerpuff Girls had one and now South Park has one. While the rest of them were more about bigger issues/better animation(Spongebob) or more a action-orientated prequel(Powerpuff), South Park manages to rip on the MPAA, Canada, Bill Gates, celebrities and who to blame for our children's misgivings.<br /><br />The boys hear that the Terrance and Phillip feature length movie Asses of Fire is premiering in South Park and the boys want to go, only they're too young. They manage to get in, but the film has plenty of dirty language, which the kids pick up and use them any chance they get. Soon all the other kids only to be caught by the parents.<br /><br />The parents decide to blame the stars of the film who are from Canada so they blame Canada as a whole. This ends up bringing about a war with the canadians, which unbeknownest to the people of South Park, is the last sign that Satan and his lover Saddam Hussein need to leave Hell and conquer the Earth.<br /><br />The film in a way rips on the Disney format of having people just suddenly bust out into songs, even when the characters know how to sing it even though they have no knowledge of the song previously. There are some hilarious songs like It's Easy, Mmkay and the ever-favorite Uncle ****er and also my favorite, a reworked version of Cartman's Kyle's Mom is a Bitch from the first season christmas episode, only it's more elaborate and musical-based.<br /><br />This also had a first, 2 of them actually where we actually see Kenny's face and hear him speak without being muffled. I don't know if it's just me but he almost sounds like Butters in a way.<br /><br />It almost seems kind of strange to watch this because it's so extravagant and more ambitious than the show, then end up watching the episodes later on. However it is a funny movie that should please fans of the show.the show. <br /> <br />
B0007Y4TVU|4.0|this new album of our 'system' is certainly more darker than their previous releases.the intro is great  after hearin the intro and byob u may think this album may sound something like 'american idiot' but actually if u go thru the album you can see that 'the system' covered various topics such as celebs, drugs to an innocent girl tryin to make it in holywood ..the intro sounds good it coulda been a superb balad if they had developed a bit and following that B.Y.O.B. the best track of the album the lyrics ,rythm..guitar riffs everythin is great ..i liked the tempo of 'everybodys goin to the party have a real good time'..revenga is very fast and energetic..ciggaro is bit funny but ok..radio/video is the another track in this album i liked very much its about the celebs mezmerizing the audianz..the coccaine track is awfull i donno why they included that in a short  running album like this ..reg the other songs i really liked the tracks violent porn which bashes the tv progammes.., 'statue' is another great song simillar to BYOB..nothin to say about 'oldschool hollywood'...and the last track 'lost in hollywood' is the only ballad of the album and it sounds great  the bad part of the album is 1. its short running (37 min)  2. malakian emerging as a lead singer over tankian..its like tre'cool of green day emerges as a lead singer and sings the whole album another thing is that the lyrics are awfully short so they got to sing the same thing over and over..but who cares the album still rocks..
B0002Y4TM4|5.0|If you ever want to start listening to marillion. Start with this album! Who ever believed they only survived thanks to Fish is wrong: with mister h. it even got better. Track 'Invisible Man' (cd2) is definitely their best song ever.
B000089RVX|1.0|Amy Lee I like how shes not all over talking off her clothes to be popular, but her singing sounds like a Soap Opera I am sorry to say, I like some of the lyrics yes there good, but the band all together's not good. I like how she makes her own clothing also. But I am sick and tried of people labeling this band Goth. Goths are long time gone or older now..Like in the 50s-80s...If you want real gothic music then listen to bands such as Dead Can Dance,Play Dead, Joy Divison, London After Midnight,Dreadful Shadows,Bauhaus..They were goths. Goth is not a bunch of people wearing makeup no you got them wrong..I am only 15 and I know whats real goth and real punk and real music..You may not argree with me But thats ur option and you can say whatever you want to..I am not telling you to stop listening to this band or anyting I am just speaking my mind in a nice way dont say its a mean way or anything cause I am not like that. Go ahead and contine liking this band.
B00005JN2Z|3.0|You can watch it without being annoyed, characters are very good, and pictures are beautiful. Intrigue does not make a slightest sense, but this is rather common in the modern cinema.    There is one thing I admire about Hollywood: even when running for her life girl would never ditch her high heels. We have plenty of high heel races here.
B000059XUO|5.0|The Crow is one of the best movies I ever seen. Brandon Lee was a good actor in it and the plot was great. The quotes in it were one of the best quotes. This is the best Crow movie out of the rest of them. The comic book was also very good. Most of the story was true, about a couple that was murdered then the writer made a story about it if the person could come back to life and get his revenge. Unfortnely Brandon Lee passed away 48 hours after the movie, but his last movie made many fans of this movie love him. He did so well in it. That it became my fav. movie of all time. The gothic setting in the story is also great.
0393035158|4.0|Having blind faith can mean holding on to good ideas that have withstood the test of time but have yet to be scientifically proven, or holding on to bad ideas that have yet to be discovered as such.  Harris comes close to throwing out the baby with the bath water, but admits that a kernel of truth lurks at the heart of religion.   <br /> <br />Spiritual experience, ethical behavior, and strong communities, he says, are essential for human happiness. In order to be viable, mysticism requires explicit instructions, \\"which need suffer no more ambiguity in their expression than we find in a manual for operating a lawn mower.\\"   <br /> <br />If it were that easy, our wise men would have already accomplished their mission. Has anyone taken their good advice to heart? Having had an \\"awakening\\" experience, I can only offer my former problem--the reason I stayed in the dark was because I not only resented good advice but fought against the truth with all my might--I was not alone, as this sems to be a universal problem.   <br /> <br />What Harris has seen is that the world was changed for the better by the spiritual, or mystical experience, which has yet to be taken seriously by either religion or science.  His efforts in this direction make his book a must read.   <br /> <br />Using terrorist tactics to wring out the truth from our political prisoners, however, is a fallacious idea, as it will not bring respect from those we wish to impress with our \\"enlightened\\" Western ways.  <br />
B00004LN16|2.0|AC/DC was a very good band in the 70s but when Bon Scott died the legend left many though. Till the 80s when they met Brain Johnson who brought the band back. Back in Black was a very good Album,and not many bands write a song to their old friend who passed away. Back In Black was the song to Bon. Angus Young is known as one of the best guitar players who can only play 3 chords I heard. I respect them for still playing at this age they are at, but the newer alubum isnt so good. I am not saying they went down,I still love them alot..
B00005JNQ8|3.0|Sean Penn and Nicole Kidman put on a master acting class in \\"The Interpreter.\\" Set amidst the shifting political alliances of the United Nations, it isn't groundbreaking or jarring, but it is thoughtful, partially because these two actors know what to do with a scene when they get a couple decent ones. <br />  <br />Kidman is Sylvia Broome, a native of the fictional African nation Matobo, an UN interpreter who overhears an apparent assassination plot of Matobo's leader, Zuwanie, a once-reformer who, not unlike Zimbabwe's Robert Mugabe, has turned his nation toward a military dictatorship. Sylvia has her reasons for wanting \\"The Teacher\\" dead, but here she is, reporting the plot to Secret Service agent Tobin Keller (Penn).  <br />  <br />Keller's assessment? \\"She's lying,\\" he tells his partner Dot (Catherine Keener). And Sylvia is - about her past, her connections to the Matobian resistance movement, maybe even her own motives.  <br />  <br />Director Sydney Pollack, out of the game since the bomb \\"Random Hearts,\\" allows \\"The Interpreter\\" to burn slowly. Keller, conversation by conversation, inches closer to Sylvia, who hides her nationalistic fervor with an idealism that seems like a front until the end, when its ironic source becomes clear, and undergirds the most critical decision of Sylvia's life.  <br />  <br />In between is the mystery - not all that mysterious - of who, if anyone, wants Zuwanie dead, or maybe just targeted for death. Let it be said that The Teacher's head of security (Jesper Christensen) hangs around the investigation a lot. One of Zuwanie's opponents (Yvan Attal) is assassinated in the movie's opening sequence; the other, wonderfully named Kuman-Kuman (George Harris) is part of movie's most suspenseful sequence aboard a NYC bus. Other scenes stand out: The dictator, Zuwanie, recalling a parade on the George Washington bridge in his honor the last time he visited New York; a quiet moment inside the United Nations, with its comfy earth tones and swooping ceilings.  <br />  <br />But the chief pleasures are Penn and Kidman. They're A-list stars now, capable of carrying a film on their presence and talent alone.  <br />  <br />Starting with \\"Mystic River,\\" Penn tapped into middle-aged weariness with authority; it never would have been said of his early career, but he now embodies \\"old-school\\" man like Jeff Bridges does - virile, wise, angry. Kidman seems to play a broad range of characters, but they're all intellectually intense, often emotionally fierce, generally challenging. Kidman pushes her acting somewhat - \\"spunk\\" can be the residue of trying a little too hard - but at least it's not a mail-in. Both peel back their personal layers haltingly until they acknowledge they're kindred spirits.  <br />  <br />Love never develops between Keller and Sylvia, but they merge as angry, romantic souls. Were political futures actually settled by people other than lifetime government employees and the Condi Rices who've spent lifetimes in library basements, you'd prefer this good-intentioned passion.   <br /> <br />3 1/2 stars
B0001UL7RY|1.0|Avril is not the type of person you think she is. She cant play guitar,she just strums on any chord she can, she even said so in a magizine. She cant sing either, She claims to be punk but look at her. Shes not even close, Punk died along time ago. If you want real punk music, then listen to bands like..Sex Pistols,Ramones,Clash,Dead Kennedys,Operation Ivy,Bad Religon,New York Dolls, I dont see the newer punk bands screaming out there lungs or writing lyrics that make no sense. I dont see the newer punks doing crazy things and punks were never on MTV...What are you little kids thinking these days? I am not telling you to not listen to her or anything but shes not what people think
B00005JNRB|2.0|Two guys, one hunky, one his goofy sidekick, find a wrecked plane half-buried in the desert. They're handcuffed to the flatbed of a truck that they unscrewed, shoved out of their captors' vehicle, and now have been hauling up and down dunes all day - without any water, mind you - until they've stumbled upon this wrecked plane. The goofy guy looks at the hunky guy, the goofy guy makes a joke, cue up Steppenwolf's \\"Magic Carpet Ride\\", and, well these guys have unlocked the handcuffs and rigged the wrecked plane into a windsurfer. <br /> <br />That's \\"Sahara\\" - the worst of \\"MacGuyver\\" mixed with the worst of \\"Indiana Jones\\" in a plot that was handled better in the \\"Tomb Raider\\" series. I'm comparing \\"Tomb Raider\\" favorably here. You get the idea.  <br /> <br />Long, ridiculously convoluted story short: Dirk (Matthew McConaughey) and Al (Steve Zahn, getting a career bump from his Texas buddy) are old treasure hunters, and Dirk believes an Civil War freighter sailed across Africa near the end of that war, ran aground in a then-fertile Sahara Desert (it was?) and remains lodged there under sand.  <br /> <br />Their quest becomes intertwined with the mission of a UN health worker (Penelope Cruz) investigating the mysterious, toxic deaths of hundreds of nomads and rebel fighters. There's a military dictator, a chemical waste plant, a wicked corporate type disguised as a humanitarian, and Dirk and Al's boss, the Admiral, played by William H. Macy, a talented professional who'll act in just about any old rotten thing.  <br /> <br />Unlike the \\"Indiana Jones\\" trilogy, content to fit archaeology into a single plot engine, \\"Sahara\\" is based on a Clive Cussler novel, and it's a buffet of perspectives and characters stuffed into two hours for the movie to ever have coherence.  <br /> <br />Was it necessary that the mysterious deaths warn of a worldwide plague? Was it useful to supply an African Civil War subplot? The two action peaks - a motorboat duel and a brawl atop a solar tower - aren't original, and the jokey-dokey interplay between McConaughey and Zahn clang against the movie's detail overload and the presence of Cruz, a stunning woman still struggling with pronuciation and syllable emphasis in the English language. Cruz inches ever closer to achieving a sense of humor, but she's still dead serious in \\"Sahara,\\" forgetting even to crack a smile in the movie's obligatory celebration scene. <br /> <br />\\"Sahra\\" sits on McConaughey's shoulders as producer/star, and possibly the lead scapegoat in a lawsuit Cussler has threatened to file after disowning the picture. Well, Dirk Pitt's no Bond or Jones or even Croft. The appeal of McConaughey eludes me. He has the face of an underfed dog, is consistently tanned to the color of a burnt turkey and seems to given over most of his career to playing the gentleman doof in romantic comedies and gunk like this.  <br /> <br />It'd be one thing if he had Harrison Ford's sarcasm but he doesn't - he drawls and lumbers about, as capable of an overnight drunk as he is a day in the action movies. He's added a thin moustache for this role; let their not be a sequel, lest young women begin to pester their boyfriends for the sleazy, casino dealer look.
0792846443|5.0|The movie starts out as a writer named Paul who gets in a car accient. Then a nice lady(Katy Batts who won a award for this movie) saves him. She was his biggest fan and was always reading his books, taking care of him then things went wrong. She got mad at him for killing Misery in his books and wanted him to redo it all. She would yell, and do anything. She was a lonely women living out in a cabin. Then she lost her mind and broke his legs so he wouldnt escape. She lied telling him the phones were not working ealier in the story. She did anything to keep him there.
B0007TKNIS|5.0|As I watched Phantom of the Opera on DVD, I was thrilled with everything that had been done in the movie.  It was brilliant to use black and white for the portions of the movie that aren't as vibrant.  It was brilliant to blend the play with some portions of the book that never made it to the play.  And the ability to choose camera angles lent the filmmakers freedom to show us details we might not have been able to pick up from a stage production.<br /><br />I feel like the people who made the film really used available resources to the best of their potential, and they deserve applause for that.  There were times when actors appeared to be lip-synching because their mouths seemed not to be open far enough to let such powerful sound emerge, but maybe their lungs are just that strong.  Also, the Phantom struck me as being a little on the young side--it's hard for a handsome young man to keep the dark, disturbing father-figure thing going.<br /><br />Still, I thought the movie was fantastic.  Great acting, great (if sometimes obvious) use of color, wonderful subtleties in many areas.
B000002UJQ|5.0|If I was to pick a band that I admire I would pick Radiohead, The vocals and the soft music is so beautiful and the lyrics. Radiohead would have to be one of the talentest bands ever.
B000003TAL|5.0|I tried to think of what rekid could be in the same class as daydream nation, and i really couldn't come up with one.  If there is such a thing as perfection, this is it...  To go on about how this changed the face of music blah blah blah is really not even what matters the most -- if you have an ear for rock and roll, put this rekid on, and just see what it does to you.
B00000250H|5.0|Janis Joplin would be a great role model for younger kids. Instead of looking up to Pop stars, porn stars and other girls who are only popular for looks, and showing off there bodies. Janis was popular for her voice, and the things she done. I admire anyone that can do anything she could of done. Her voice was so strong that it was so beautiful shes been though so many things as a young kid and she proved them all wrong when she became one of the best Women singers...I admire Janis Joplin. She would be a great role model.
B000059XUP|1.0|How bad is this movie?  Let me put it this way:  I demanded a refund when I rented this so-called movie. <br />It is a cross between a random collection of unrelated things that clueless marketing \\"experts\\" think need to be included to \\"sell\\" a \\"franchise\\", and trite soft-core gay fantasies that hack directors mistakenly believe are \\"artistic\\". <br />This movie is so horrible that even bad-movie aficionados will find nothing in it to enjoy. <br />Don't even think of wasting money on this; instead run away as fast as you can. <br />I'd award this one negative stars if I could.
B00005NGZX|5.0|Converge would have to be one of the best newer Metal bands out there, Most metal bands I hear pretty much dont know how to yell their lungs out. They dont know what to think of. Metal is suppose to be angry music. I saw a person on here say Limp Bizket made Metal no think again..Iron Madien, Black Sabbath and other older legands made it and Converge is keeping in there for us to enjoy it..Whenever people are made we have metal music..Dont listen to Limp Bizket that can just make u think what is he doing..rapping is mostly what hes full of..
B00003CX5P|3.0|Okay, folks - settle down. It's not the Second Coming and it's not the end of cinema as we know it. It is a prequel that feels especially dependent on its sequels (made and unmade) for interest.     Set 30 years before the events that unfold in the much-loved STARS WARS trilogy, it chronicles the deprived childhood of Anakin Skywalker (Jake Lloyd), who grows up to be Darth Vader, and the travails of teen Queen Amidala (Natalie Portman) of Naboo, who must save her planet from destruction while weighed down by a series of brow-burdening headdresses. In Amidala's corner: Jedi knights Qui-Gon Jinn (Liam Neeson) and his cheeky apprentice Obi-Wan Kenobi (Ewan McGregor), who will, of course, mature into Luke Skywalker's wise mentor. Against her: devilish-looking Darth Maul (Ray Parks), a passel of toad-like aliens who take their marching orders from Maul's hooded boss, and the apparently benevolent Senator Palpatine (Ian McDiarmid), who must be two-faced scum because he's due to metamorphose somewhere down the line into the Emperor of the evil Empire. There's plenty to look at: The movie's crammed with goofball aliens, futuristic hardware and elaborate costumes, some of them truly stunning in their intricacy. The lumbering banality of the dialogue, ameliorated in places by the efforts of actors like Neeson and McGregor, is painful but hardly unexpected - the trilogy is full of wince-inducers. But it's a bit disturbing that along with the simplistic heroics of old-fashioned space operas, this film has also picked up their unexamined racism: Why, for example, do the duplicitous toad aliens speak and dress like Chinese people? And how did comic-relief Jar Jar Binks (Ahmed Best), a lizard-like creature notable for his affable cowardice, come to sound Rastafarian?     It's a kiddie movie rejiggered for childish grown-ups, of whom there are enough to make it a hit. How such childishness has become a virtual secular religion is hard to imagine, and far beyond the scope of moviecriticism.
B00063MBU8|1.0|Simple plan is a bunch of pop punks trying to say there punk, when labels are stupid. I see pictures of them and they try to hard to be punks or whatever you people call them, Its the wrose album ever, and there on MTV..And what were they thinking when they made Bad religon song?..IF you like this, then thats fine, But i really dont understand it..but thats my thoughts..and MTV ROCKS..Most of the bands u named from back then are not posers..Cause there on mtv means jack..Get a life
B0000A1RJI|4.0|This is one of the greatest soundtracks that I have heard in quite some time. They have a good selection of items from the movie, not leaving much out. The only 2 things i have against the soundtrack is that it is disorganized and that it doesnt contain as much music as it could have (Contains about 43 minutes). But it is still worth picking up if you enjoyed the movie.
B000784WMW|5.0|I first saw this Jane Eyre version a long time ago and I'm very happy to see that there is finally a DVD ! <br />But I have an important question for me : I would like to know if there are english subtitles in this DVD version ? I can't find this answer... <br />I'm french and even if I understand quiet well english, it would be so easier for me to understand everything !  <br /> <br />Thank you in advance for your help because I'm so impatient to order this item !!! <br /> <br />
0634022296|5.0|Great book for a guitarist. Chords seem pretty accurate. The binding is problematic. I borrowed our acrylic cook book holder from the kitchen and it works great to hold the book open to the song you want. Binding problem solved! You can get the cook book holder here on Amazon for about $8.
B0007P3582|2.0|The ego has landed, once again, to the exultant cheer of the senseless, still leaving numerous question marks lingering in the spring equinox over Hip-Hop.  The phrase, \\" What Now \\" , seems to run rampant through the majestic streets of America.  It was unavoidable.  It was inevitable.  It was the moment Curtis Jackson`s dream of being placed in the pantheon of hereos disappeared before him.  Everyone knew it.  Everyone   -    but 50cent!  So here we are, 2005.  At a time when the more chic, radio-friendly pop sounds are dominating musical spectrums, another mediocre album is released from it`s hatch, THE MASSACRE  which , inevitably, knocks yet another piece of the monument to those who made Rap meaningful, ( Ice Cube, Public Enemy, 2Pac, Nas ) ! Yet in this album, the lyrics are in no way exceptional!  But still, much to my amazement, some harbor 50cent as the Monarch of Rap, hence he attempts to demolish his oponents alike the claimant to throne of 1461, Henry Tudor, defeated Richard the Third in warfare, \\" Piggy Bank \\" .  When pressed to elaborate a narrative, the \\" Candy Shop \\" , will evoke the snigger so often amid dedicated rap lovers.  \\" I `ll let you lick my lollipop \\" .  Hardly the fresh impetus I was hoping for.  But if he is billed as \\" The Next 2Pac \\" , he should be able to duplicate 2Pac`s prophetic style in \\" I`m Supposed To Die Tonight \\" , should he not?  Well, the awful lyrics in this song clearly sends out the message that he can`t!  By now your probably wondering where is the summit on THE MASSACRE?  Still, I am sad to say, there isn`t one, only the incessant pursuit of females, \\" Get In My Car \\", which becomes the leitmotif in the LP.  Emotionally frought, he recalls how his sins of law-breaking will eventually find him \\" Guns Come Out \\" .  The hastily ready-made \\" Outta control \\" and the monotonous \\" Just A Lil` Bit \\" easily wins the award for the most fatuous club tracks in living memory.  How many more meaningless melodies, I hear you ask?  Plenty, says I!  But nobody really knows when it comes to someone as slow-witted as Curtis Jackson!  But Hip-Hops embarrassment seems to be in the habit of blowing his horn, \\" Ski Mask \\", and many tracks with a litany of references to illegal stimulants exposes the serious doubt over his subject matter, \\" A Baltimore Love Thing \\" !  Sadly, THE MASSACRE may be hailed as a classic.  Then again,............................it probably wont!  Rap has indeed been poorly expressive of frustration.  Still, it is the former Queensbridge tenant who embarrassingly sought to apply a realistic gangster image, \\" In My Hood \\" .  Incessant bragging is not a pragmatic approach of soothing out his troughs, \\" God Gave Me Style \\" .  Such is the ignorance of Curtis Jackson, that he recently promulgated he should wear the crown as the \\" King Of New York \\" .  Whether fraught of angst or sodomy, or if he finds himself thrust into the heart of battle, this is undoubtedly the massacre of Hip-Hop!  What is also so deeply disturbing is the absence of positivity, \\" Gatman And Robbin` \\" .  But , 50 Cent now has two options, continue to shame music, or do the decent thing!
B0000D96NW|5.0|Machine Head is by far one of my favorite bands. This is the perfect album to follow up to an extremely mundane and poorly put together album (\\"Supercharger\\"), as the band returns to its post-thrash roots sound they carried with \\"Burn My Eyes\\" and \\"The More Things Change...\\".<br /><br />I was very anticipated for this album. I heard a rumor that it was going to come out on December 2003. Unfortunately, that was the European release date, so I had to wait a few more months until I could listen to it. This album is amazing. The opener, and the first single, \\"Imperium\\", shows that the band is recapturing the sound they put together on \\"Burn My Eyes\\". \\"Bite The Bullet\\" is full of dynamic power, while \\"Days Turn Blue To Gray\\" also focuses on bringing back the sound that old Machine Head fans have enjoyed.<br /><br />Usually, when a band goes downhill with an album, they can never pick back up (Metallica), but Machine Head does the exact opposite in this case. Highly recommended.<br /><br />You'll like this if you like:<br /><br />\\"The End Of Heartache\\" by Killswitch Engage<br /><br />\\"Burn My Eyes\\" by Machine Head<br /><br />\\"Far Beyond Driven\\" by Pantera
0060278234|5.0|I came across Lirael by reading the first book, Sabriel. I had actually come across THAT book by just picking it off a shelf from the public library. <br /> <br />The book, Lirael, is about a girl named Lirael who is supposed to be one of the Daughters of the Clayr. Unlike the rest of the clan, she cannot See into the future, and she has dark hair, brown eyes, and light skin that never tans. The other Clayr have blonde hair, blue or green eyes, and very tan skin, and they can See into the future at an early age. They all live together on the Clayr's Glacier in the far north of the Old Kingdom. <br />Because she is not accepted as a Clayr, and have no parents to guide her, she cannot stand the pain of being left out, so she decides to kill herself on her fourteenth birthday by throwing herself off the Glacier. Just as she is about to do so, she sees something off in the distance, and changes her mind, so she hides in the snow. Strange things happen from then on, and she is sent on a journey. <br />At the same time, Sabriel [the Abhorsen] and Touchstone [the King], now married with two children, Sameth and Ellimere, have gone all over the kingdom to try pinpointing the bringer of a new evil, who resides in Death and takes his Dead servants out to destroy the newly rebuilt kingdom.  <br /> <br />I wish not to reveal any more of the book, other than to say that it ends quite abruptly and leaves you hanging, thirsting for the third book, Abhorsen. In fact, when I finished Lirael, I also reserved Abhorsen from the library at the same time. I wish I had bought the books instead of borrowing them. <br /> <br />Anyway... <br />Reading Lirael was a great enjoyment, and I finished the book in about 2-3 days. In other words, I loved the book. Lirael [the book] is able to stand alone by itself without reading Sabriel, but if you read the first book, Sabriel, before reading this one, everything will make much more sense, because you will then understand the background of Sabrieland Touchstone, and what an Abhorsen is. However, if you read that one or not, this book will capture the minds of humans of any age. <br /> <br />Enjoy!
B00080ZG10|5.0|\\"The Aviator\\" is a marvelous and amazing movie. It's long at nearly three hours but is so well crafted that the time zips by. It's both a biography and a fantasy because much of its subject matter revolves around Hollywood in the 1930s and because its protagonist, Howard Hughes, was even larger than the larger than life stars he mingled with.  <br /> <br />Leonardo DiCaprio plays Hughes, the incredibly rich heir to a Texas fortune. Brash, young and emotionally unstable, he headed to Hollywood determined to make movies. He produced \\"Hell's Angels\\", which at the time was the most expensive movie ever made. Moguls laughed at his efforts, but the movie went on to become a smash hit. Meanwhile, Hughes became obsessed with aviation, founded Hughes Aircraft and later started TWA airlines.  <br /> <br />The fascinating thing about Hughes was that, while he was an intelligent and handsome man, he was bedeviled by madness. I suspect everyone around him, including Katherine Hepburn [Kate Blanchett], who was his lover, knew this. We may never know if it was just his money that kept him afloat or if there was something special about him.  <br /> <br />DiCaprio is superb. He rivals Johnny Depp as a physical actor. His intensity almost jumps off the screen. Kate Blanchett both is and isn't Hepburn, perhaps the most unique star of all time, but her portrayal is superb. <br /> <br />\\"The Aviator\\" captures a period of American history in an extraordinary way. Some have said that the movie is a little cold. I think the truth is that its subject, Mr. Hughes, was a bit unknowable.  <br />
0380789019|5.0|A friend gave me three books by Neil Gaimen when she was utterly shocked that I had never read any of his books. The first was Neverwhere, the second Stardust, and the final American Gods. I read them in order of publication, and I have to say that I was shocked that each book seemed to get worse for me. <br /> <br />I thought Neverwhere was great. It was unique and original, and I found myself trying to figure out what was happening and what was going to happen next. If you're looking for a modern-day Alice in Wonderland type of an adventure, then this is definitely for you! <br /> <br />Stardust was also enjoyable. I didn't enjoy it as much as Neverwhere, but I still thought it was enjoyable. <br /> <br />American Gods though, probably tainted me from Gaimen from this point onward. The book itself took me over 2 months to read (and I usually read books in 1-3 days), and I thought it just dragged and dragged and dragged. Sure, the concept was interesting, but if my stubbornness to finish something I started (not to mention read something that was leant to me), I would definitely have stopped reading this. I could hardly bare more than 15 minutes a day dedicated to this book. <br /> <br />
B0007GAERG|5.0|Not that she ever really left but definitely the return of her domination of the charts. I never thought she could come up with such an unbelievable collection of songs that could challenge and eventually top Music Box, Daydream and Butterfly both commercially and critically. There are hardly any weak tracks in this record. Stand out tracks include We Belong Together, It's Like That, Shake It Off, Say Something, Circles, I Wish You Knew....Really, I can just list all the songs on this album. My favorite track however is STAY THE NIGHT. It's easily the best ballad in the album and it is definitely the best baby-making song Mariah has ever recorded. It is remarkable how she was almost written off with the rise of new undeserving divas but the return of Mimi proves who truly is the Queen.

B0008ISM40|2.0|I don't know what happened to Trent between the release of The Fragile and this album, but it's not good.  He's lost all of his edge and originality, and all that's left are cheesy lyrics aimed towards a more mainstream crowd. <br /> <br />There were two songs I liked on this album... \\"Right where it belongs\\" and \\"Only\\" (simply for the fact that I love deep sounding 80's synths).  Most of the other songs are just stupid... \\"WITH THE TEETH----UHHHHHH!!!!\\"  and \\"I pick things up... I am a collector...\\" <br /> <br />I understand he was trying to make a simpler album and neglected the instrumental tracks, but honestly, that is his strong point.  He's getting a little old to be whining about his feelings using trite, contrived lyrics.  His strength (though he may not want to admit it himself) is in sound engineering and composition, not poetry. <br /> <br />I really wish he hadn't given up more interesting projects like the Doom3 music (which would have turned out awesome if he had stuck to it) to put out this almost completely crap album.  Trent, if you ever read this -- stick to what you are good it.  Try to grow and evolve as a musician.  You have incredible technical skills when it comes to electronic music, and that's what we like to hear.
B0008G2IRO|5.0|My older brother was a big fan of there first album. And then i started to like it becuse at the time i was listening to a lot of J-pop and Drum and bass (plus Slayer) But this blowed my mind. I mean a crazy anime style rap group with a singer that looks like Tai from digimon. I KNEW I WOULD LIKE IT. But this album is even better then the last Gorillaz album. Plus it has Danger Mouse on it.... You know the guy who did the infamous gray album.
0316096199|5.0|This memoir is a very easy read that will keep your interest page after page.  Sebold is brutally honest and gives many details of the attack, her thoughts and others' reactions.  It reads more as a well-written story with a first-person narrator than an individual's recollections.  As a result, you'll find yourself highly involved in the story as you walk through each event with the characters.  Sebold is a talented author and an inspiring survivor.  I highly encourage all to read this book, whether they are a survivor, a friend or spouse of a survivor, or simply interested in a good read!  This is one of the best books that I have ever read!

B0007GAERG|5.0|Mariah has not lost an inch. Her voice is back and better than ever. I can't understand all these silly 1,2 and 3 star reviews. Mariah's voice can be both a powerful and subtle instrument, and she showcases both on \\"The Emancipation of Mimi.\\" Mariah is in perfect form on her #1 song, \\"We Belong Together.\\" This song definitely rivals any of her other well-known ballads. Once again, this album proves that her vocal versatility is unmatched.
B000929AJQ|5.0|...by previous reviewers, so I won't even try.  If this were a negative review, which it may have been had I written it after only one or two listens, I could've gone with an attention-grabbing title that doubled as a NIN reference, such as The Big Comedown or Every Song is Exactly the Same.  But I'll gladly trade the opportunity to make a self-promoting review title that mocks this album for an album that would make me worthy of mockery were I to mock it.  And that is what we have here.  Once my initial reservations about lack of standout tracks and discernable emotion from Trent were offset by my adjustment to the unique, Dave Grohl-driven sound of the album as a whole, a five-star review was a formality.  I haven't really listened to anything else this entire month, and that's ultimately the only meaningful test a record has to pass.  Even my dear mother, someone who would probably consider the Celine Dion concert the highlight of her recent trip to Vegas, was overly impressed with the (carefully) selected tracks I told her to listen to, such as All the Love In the World (\\"but make sure you skip ahead after that one, Mom, because you won't like the chorus of the next song\\") and the closing triad, especially Right Where it Belongs.  So, if one can replace the parental advisory with a parental endorsement and still derive great enjoyment from the album, then it's obvious that that you shouldn't pass by With Teeth in this virtual marketplace.  Order it and put it in your CD player, right where it belongs.
B000268QB2|5.0|The first time I saw Keane was on 'Ellen' (the talkshow) and I was drawn into their incredible sound and talent.  I am a big music fan and keep up pretty well with what's \\"in\\" (what my kids are listening to :o)  I bought \\"Hopes & Fears\\" and was amazed to realize that I loved EVERY song on the album (which is VERY unusual).  So my husband, surprised me with 5th row seats at Massey Hall in Toronto, Canada for KEANE'S concert of May 28/05. <br /> <br />My review?  Let's just say, I'm in love!  Tom, Richard and Tim are just amazing!  \\"Hopes & Fears\\" is the best, but live - even better!!  Can you imagine??  A band sounding better live, than recorded!  Pretty rare these days.  Anyway, if KEANE ever sees this, all I have to say is, \\"Please don't stop making music!!!  You guys ROCK!  Don't lose your charm as you become more recognized ;o)  You're going to be around a looooong time!!  You are the BEST concert I've seen in my life!  I look forward to seeing you again in Toronto  - soon I hope!  Lynn xoxo
B000001DVD|5.0|This is Def Leppard's best album. Before they glossed up their sound, they recorded this masterpiece of raw hard rock. This CD contains great melodies, their best guitar riffs, and amazing lead guitar. Joe Elliot's voice is still strong on this one and he sings,  shrieks and growls his way through it like a man possessed. I like some of Def Lep's work after this but none of it matches High N' Dry. I wish they had kept this meaner sound throughout their career.

0743454537|3.0|Great potential but badly researched, too improbable and an unforgivable ending.  <br /> <br />Basic synopsis: parents create a child, Anna, purely to provide cells and tissue for elder sister, Kate, who is very ill with cancer. At age 13 Anna is sick of being used for spare parts and worries about her own health as it has come to her sister needing one of her kidneys. She sues her parents for the medical rights to her own body. It is meant to be a heart wrenching trip thru human emotions and make you question who is right and who is wrong. But I didn't find that. I was with Anna 100% of the way and that NEVER changed through out the book. This book made me nothing but angry at the way Anna was treated: purpose built to provide for another.  <br /> <br />The mother, Sara, made me angriest of all: she is a total monster. She cares about no one except her ill daughter, Kate. She should never have had Anna as she exploits her shamelessly and feels she should serve her purpose as a tissue donor and nothnig more. Take Anna's birth for example: she freely admits she has only thought of this child in terms of what she can do for the sick child Kate and she hasn't even thought about names even though she is full term pregnant. During  Anna's birth, Sara says \\"the cord be careful\\". Then she talks about how the cord will be stored for Kate's later use. Immediately following this is a story about 3 year old Kate's radiotherapy and chemo and then the moment when she is given the cord blood transfusion. NOT A SINGLE WORD about her new baby, Anna. That will give you an indication about how much time she spent with her and how much she cared about her.  Sara can only see that she has a sick child and she is incapable of giving any thoughts to her healthy children. Anna is a blip on the mothers radar ONLY because of what she can do for Kate. Jesse is just completely ignored.  She feels that as they are healthy, they therefore have no problems and don't need as much (or if any) attention from her.  <br /> <br />The lack of narrative from Kate and sickly realtionship between her and her mother only makes her appear unsympathetic. Cancer or not, I found myself not feeling much sympathy for her. <br /> <br />The writer isn't even consistent. For example, when Kate is diagnosed with cancer at age 2, the mother worries about who will care for her elder child Jesse while she stays in hospital with Kate. She states that BOTH sets of grandparents are dead. But a few chapters later, Anna is talking about funerals and makes reference to the time she attended her grandmothers funeral...! The writer forgets that she wrote a few chapters earlier that they were all dead long before Anna was even conceived. I cannot believe that even the proof readers missed such an obvious mistake before this books publication. <br /> <br />The ending is ridiculous and improbable. I wanted to throw the book at the wall when I read it. I doubt I'll ever read a Judith Picoult novel again.  <br /> <br /> <br />***** MAJOR SPOILERS***** <br /> <br /> <br />After making the hard decision to declare Anna medically emancipated and so doesn't have to donate a kidney to save her sister, the writer doesn't follow thru and takes the easy way out in not dealing with how the family would recover from such a decision. What I found extremely worrying about this was that after 14 years of refusing to give up on Kate no matter how near death she was, the parents don't even wait a single day after the car accident before deciding Anna is beyond help and switching off her life support machines. You would think after giving Kate 14 years of devotion they would at least give Anna 24-48 hours to see if she improves but no: they harvest her organs straight away to provide Kate with a kidney. I found that deeply disturbing.   <br /> <br />Also, the 2010 narrative from Kate. It's too improbable. At the time of the court hearing, Kate was in end stage renal failure and was given a week to live. Shehas also suffered gruelling treatments for cancer throughout her life that would no doubt weaken her body. Thus all likelihood is, she would never have survived the kidney transplant. But she makes a FULL recovery and strangely, she is also totally cured from cancer.  Not only that, she is thriving and has become a ballet teacher. That is impossible given that she was desperately sick all her life and probably never did ballet classes herself. She would never be able to train as a dance teacher so late in life especially not when recovering from a kidney transplant at age 16 <br /> <br />All of this makes me doubt the accuracy of everything that was written. For this reason I only give it 3 stars. <br /> <br />A more likely ending is that, Kate would die from renal failure having not received a transplant and Anna would live. The mother would be unable, in the long term to forgive Anna for what she did. The parents would possibly end up divorced with the father, Brian, taking Anna and Jesse as the mother has no interest in them, especially Anna. It should end with an epilogue from Anna explaining how she is estranged from her mother and hurt because she was never really loved for who she is. Anna should also re-iterate her early point that if your parents have you for a reason, then once that reason is gone so are you.
0920668372|5.0|If you have a young daughter or granddaughter, buy this book for them.  It just might become their favorite book of all time.  I've now met two high school aged girls who told me this was their favorite book.  These were both girls who became very family orientated.  It's rare to find such a simple children's book that has the ability to make such a lasting impact on lives.
0061015725|4.0|Indeed it is a scary thought: killer nanoparticles that swarm and devour anybody in its path. The novel is about nanotechnology, but it deals also with the evolution of atom-sized robots and the computer intelligence that drives them. The word \\"Prey\\", which the book is titled, refers to the program that gives the killer swarm its instructions.    It is a really good read. Crichton has a way of weaving together science fiction and the terrifying consequences of science's alleged misuse into a really good story.    If you are totally new to nanotechnology, \\"Prey\\" is a good, albeit fictitious, introduction.    Another winner from Michael Crichton.
B0007TKNII|1.0|Bad, bad, bad. That was the repetitive word marching through my thoughts as I watched this horror-of-a-movie. First let me say that I will normally watch a terrible film to its end just so that I can brag about watching it (sorta like when I was a kid and someone dared me to swallow a live worm. I did it so I could say I was brave). But having grown up I now know the difference between bravery and stupidity. Show me a worm now and I'll at least fry it up before making it a tasty treat (just kidding!).<br /><br />But seriously, this film just doesn't hold together when compared against the stage-play version. Most notably is the overly attractive cast, including THE PHANTOM! I mean, this guy is supposed to be disfigured, right? But here he's a hunk. Come on! And the lip synching was horrifically obvious. The modernization of the music was terribly forced, too...<br /><br />And I noticed all of these...things...less than 45 minutes into the film, which is when I finally (mercifully) ended my suffering by turning it off.<br /><br />I breathed a sigh of relief and went into the kitchen to look for a can of worms to eat. Anything would have been better than turning that monstrosity back on!
B000929AJQ|4.0|I don't know - I'm happy I've got a new nine inch nails album I guess. I prefer this to The Fragile, but looking back, it's quite clear that the man is not doing his best, although I do think he's still got it in him. For the most part, the record seems a bit uninspired, but he certainly gets his act together for the last two, maybe three tracks. While the rest of the album seems a bit directionless, the ending sequence is obviously crafted; it's kind of a denoumont followed by a resolution, which I think works brilliantly. <br /> <br />I think the lesson here is that Reznor is a craftsman - he doesn't just vomit out great stuff. The Downward Spiral was a classic because it was meticulously crafted - the sound was richly textured, and the whole thing fit together extremely well. This was not: the songs, by his own admission, were mostly written quite quickly and just plonked on the album in the name of \\"honesty\\", and I'm sure this approach works well with some artists, but just not with Reznor. I think what the man needs to do - or at least what I need him to do, is get back in the studio and spend the next couple of years doing what he does best: twiddling knobs and agonising over details. He's shown he can still do it, now it's time to do it properly.
1400032717|3.0|I had read wonderful reviews on this book and I was very excited to start reading it. But for me the book just dragged on and on. I couldn't take Christopher after awhile and he really got on my nerves. But putting that aside, the writing was great and it was an interesting story. Give it a shot if you want.
B0007TKNII|4.0|Well, to begin, I'm going to say I thought this movie was fantastic for the most part. It was visually stunning, the sets were absolutely beautiful. The acting was good, not great, but good.  <br /> <br />Probably the best thing I have to say about this movie is the actual music. As for the vocals, they were good. But the music in this movie is absolutely beautiful. Haunting beautiful. People complain about it being \\"too musical\\" but it is a musical. And a much better musical than most. People compare it to Moulin Rouge and Chicago, which honestly just absolutely sickens me. Those movies are nothing in comparison musically to Phantom of the Opera. <br /> <br />As for the acting... it wasn't the best, but it wasn't horrible either. Rossum, along with Wilson, had a few shaky parts but did rather well. Now... with all that said, I'd have to say my biggest problem was the Phantom. Not his acting, and not even his singing, I've never seen the broadway version, but I have heard the soundtrack, and while I think Gerard Butler CAN sing, there is no doubt that Michael Crawford outsings him 20 times over. But... even though Butler's voice isn't great, he makes up for it with the passion and force he puts behind it.  <br /> <br />My other problem with the phantom is that he just looks so good. The Phantom is supposed to be completely disfigured and just revolting. But, throughout the entire movie, even when he's NOT wearing his mask, he's still 20 times more attractive than, say, Raoul, who is supposed to be the most handsome man in the movie, but he still doesn't quite live up to the Phantom in that regard. I mean, what woman WOULDN'T choose the phantom over Raoul in this movie? <br /> <br />But even saying those few bad things about Phantom of the Opera, I think it's definetely added to my \\"favorite movie\\" list. And, I definetely recommend this movie.
6304618344|5.0|In Hollywood,there are realistic films,but there are also unrealistic films also. A movie is a movie-and we've seen realistic fiction movies before(\\"Mercury Rising\\"),realistic movies that were true stories(\\"Windtalkers\\"),and there are also some films that as good as they are,have been unrealistic. \\"Face/Off\\" falls in the category of films that happens to be unrealistic. However,it is also unbelievable,and it is one of the best films both Nicolas Cage and John Travolta have ever done. Read on for my review of this:    This movie starts off with John Travolta playing Sean Archer,an FBI agent in Los Angeles. Archer has pretty much everything-a wife,a lot of awards,and even though she has become really bratty,a teenage daughter named Janie. However,there is one thing that is missing from Archer's life,and this isn't something like a condo in Aruba or the Democratic/Republican nomination for President-it's something more than that. What he is missing is his son,Michael,who was killed a while back ago(they actually show that at the very beginning of the movie). The man who killed him is Caster Troy(Nicolos Cage),a terrorist who is Archer's archrival.When Troy killed Archer's son,it was actually just an attempt to kill Archer;however,the bullet missed and ended up killing Archer's son. Ever since then,Archer has been trying to get even with Troy for killing his son.    Then,that day finally comes. After Archer has found out that Troy has planted a bomb in L.A. and he(Troy)ends up in a coma,Archer is approached by a fellow FBI agent who introduces him to Dr. Malcolm Walsh,who has a plan that will help Archer get the bomb and get even with Troy. The plan is that he(Walsh)will remove both Archer's face and Troy's face,put Troy's face on Archer's,and then Archer,disguised as Troy,will enter the Los Angeles prison where Troy's brother Pollux is at,stay there for a few days,find out where the bomb is,and then get pulled out of the prison,find the bomb,and get it out of the building. So,even though Archer is reasonably worried about several things(he has been told that he can't tell his wife,his boss,or anybody about the operation)he takes the mission.    Then,the next morning,Archer(who is now portrayed by Nicolas Cage)wakes up wearing Troy's face,and enters the prison. Things are going hard for him,but after all,he is Castor Troy(or so they think). However,Archer accomplishes what he is there for-he finds out where the bomb is,except there is one problem:Troy eventually wakes up from his coma,makes doctors transform him into Archer,and then after that,kills all of the doctors who knew about the information and burns all of the papers that have proof about what happened. And once that happens,well,I won't give away everything,but here is a good example of what it is like for the two archrivals once they are wearing each other's faces:    \\"I don't know what I hate wearing worse:Your face or your body. I mean I certainly do enjoy boning your wife, but let's face it, we both like it better the other way yes? So why don't we trade back\\"?    This is defnitely one of the most interesting movies I have ever seen. The chemisty is strong,the acting is really good,and if you put yourself into the shoes of one of the characters in this film and totally forgot that you were watching a movie,You would probably find it interesting to how Troy acts when he is disguised as Archer(and everyone thinks that's who he really is)while you see how Archer acts when he is disguised as Troy(and everyone thinks who he really is also).

B0002S947K|5.0|Ray LaMontagne is a true find.  How often does an artist come along that can stand up to the greatness of Van Morrison, or (dare I say it?) Bob Dylan?  Here's one, and here's hoping he's around for a long time to come. <br /> <br />LaMontagne was a high school dropout, working in a shoe factory in rural Maine, when he woke up one day to a song on the radio that changed his life.  Hearing that song made him realize that this - singing, writing songs - was what he was meant to do with his life.  And it turns out the man has the talent to back up this epiphanal experience. <br /> <br />The CD is mellow, uplifting, and heart-breaking.  The title track will fill you with the utter joy of a man who's had a hard life, but who's been, \\"saved by a woman,\\" as LaMontagne joyfully exclaims.  On \\"How Come\\" he laments of the senselessness of \\"man, killing man, killing man, killing man, I don't understand.\\"  And all the other tracks are equally as wonderful.
0226039331|4.0|I was not so impressed with this lexicon. It did not give the full meanings of many Biblical words. I was VERY disconcerted by the printing of the letters kappa and chi - they both were the same! Was this a typo by The University of Chicago Press? At any rate, I would still recommend this book as it does seem to cover much of the most important words of the New Testament such as \\"predestination,\\" \\"spirit,\\" \\"baptism,\\" and some others. Though the cost does not match the overall quality of this text, i.e., the cost ($) is way too high. <br />-Dr. Cris Graham
B00004TCPJ|1.0|It would be too cruel to say that this disc can only be enjoyed by those with poor taste.  I don't want to disparage those listeners who find that they like this recording, which features two of the most celebrated performers of Rachmaninoff - pianist Vladimir Horowitz and conductor Eugene Ormandy, both of whom knew the composer intimately and collaborated with him.  The first time I listened to this CD as a young musician in search of inspiration, I was impressed, too.  Subjectively, the old maestros Horowitz and Ormandy can have quite an impact.  And as other reviewers have said, it is certainly more pleasant to listen to than the very shoddy original record released 3 weeks after the performance.    Objectively, though, and by the standards of piano playing today, this recording ranks among the worst ever made.  The problems are numerous and overpowering, and they compound upon one another to produce a vile concoction.  Even the sympathetic David Dubal, a good friend of Horowitz's and the editor of Remembering Horowitz: 125 Pianists Recall a Legend, wrote that this performance was \\"marked by excess and self-absorbed melancholy.\\"  Some of these problems are: a crass, harsh pianistic tone that sounds like the hammers were filed to a point to sound as percussive as possible; a dire lack of either forward drive or convincing languor; only the most tenuous of connections between pianist and conductor; and wrong notes all over the place.    The severe lapse in quality, compared with his great recordings from the '30s and '50s, is characteristic of his work from the late '70s.  Horowitz was always temperamental; at the height of his fame in the '50s, he suddenly withdrew from performing.  A decade later, he re-emerged, already sixty-two years old, and re-launched his career with the same force that had come with his emergence in the '20s as a virtuoso of astonishing ability.  From there he enjoyed many productive years, but by the late '70s, he had started to decline.He aged, as everyone does, and wrestled with health problems.  By 1982, he was a shadow of himself, heavily medicated and suffering severe memory lapses, but a period of recuperation saw him give some of the most amazing recordings of Mozart, Schumann, and Scriabin in the final years of his life.  But before that, unfortunately, he left a Liszt Sonata, some Schubert Impromptus, a Chopin First Ballade, and a Rachmaninoff Third Concerto which are deplorable.    The Horowitz of 1965 who had been so good at assimilating the entire content of the score was replaced with an artist in a fat-Elvis period, no longer able to hold his concentration and forced to compensate with fireworks. It all rings false, and does no favors to the music he plays.  Instead of this, by all means, hear Horowitz's earlier recording with Fritz Reiner.  The same performance of the Sonata from this CD is also on that disc, so you can still decide for yourself whether you agree with me.  Even if you don't like the 1980 Sonata, though, the 1951 Concerto is excellent, worlds apart from this 1978 recording, and well worth the price.  There are also some appealing encore pieces included on that disc which are absent here, so all in all, it's clearly the better choice.    I can assume this will not be a terribly popular review, because Horowitz is - rightly - one of the sacred cows of the pianistic world, but to this listener, this disc is the nadir of Horowitz's output, and its popularity is puzzling and unfortunate.
B000003N7Y|5.0|I bought this CD a couple of months ago, and I've listened to it dozens of times since!!! And never get tired of it. Mingus music, and this album specially, has the quality of grow and grow after repeated listenings. The music is always changing, offering diferent aspects, different moods, and even after exhaustive listening one founds himself discovering new things. <br /> <br />It is very difficult to say which is the \\"best\\" album of Charles Mingus, since all his discography is extraordinarily consistent, but this one ranks among the best, for sure!.  <br /> <br />If you are a newcomer to the Mingus' Universe, this album is a good starting point, because is a work of great quality, but maybe more acccesible than other records of his extense discography. It also offers a good and complete overview of the complex landscape of Mingus as a bandleader, a bass player, and a composer.  <br /> <br />And if you are not a newcomer, buy this album NOW!!
B000001E3V|5.0|This is an example of some of Claptons' finest live playing on a  Fender. He has his Strat singing with soulful abandon as he works his way through some fantastic material. As other reviewers have stated, there are alternate versions of \\"Why Does Love Got To Be So Sad\\", \\"Tell the Truth\\", and \\"Let it Rain\\" which really is a crying shame. The versions on \\"In Concert\\" are so much better it's a mystery to me why they even included the other versions. If you're really into Clapton or want to get an idea of why he's a legend, I strongly suggest that you buy \\"In Concert\\" in addition to this.  The versions of \\"Why Does Love Got To Be So Sad\\" and \\"Let it Rain\\" are spellbindingly good on the original release! After you hear the difference, you'll thank me-I promise! These are a MUST to hear! The band is more focused, the jams build beautifully and Clapton is just wailing away on his Strat with abandon. \\"Live at the Fillmore\\" has all the rest of the tour de force material plus more tracks not on \\"In Concert\\" such as \\"Crossroads\\", \\"Nobody Knows When You're Down and Out\\" and \\"Little Wing\\".  The wah playing on \\"Roll it Over\\", \\"Got to Get Better In a Little While\\" is particularly superb, he uses it brilliantly to enhance the phrasing-oh yeah! \\"Blues Power\\" with it's raw vocals and soloing is a stand out track. \\"Have You Ever Loved a Woman\\" features him singing straight from the heart and playing with raw emotion in every note he hits. Pure magic courtesy of Derek and the Dominos!
B000929AJQ|2.0|I concur with a lot of others that this is a disappointment from the get-go.  This album should've went back to the drawing board half-way through because it sounds like it was only half done.  Gone is the harshness, the dirty, screeching guitars, and heavy kicking beats - the stuff I love about NIN.  There are few songs here that sound truely like NIN songs at all, and I think I know the reason why this is.  Usually NIN songs revolve around a particular electronic/industrial beat, whereas \\"With Teeth\\" songs sound like they started out as garage band guitar songs and really never evolve from there.  The songs are underproduced, lifeless, and sound forced, like he's trying too hard. <br /> <br />I give Trent an awful lot of credit for being a talented songwriter, but it sounds like the genius electronic programming is completely missing here.  What happened to Trent's buddies that did Spiral and Fragile??  He needed their help.  The only songs I like are \\"Everyday is Exactly the Same\\", \\"Only\\", and \\"Sunspots\\", the rest is dribble.  I'll forgive Trent, but he better come back with a better album next time.
B0007OCG56|4.0|James L. Brooks' SPANGLISH is a movie about the clash of cultures and lifestyles. In the middle of the movie, Flor (Paz Vega), a Mexican immigrant who works as a maid for the affluent Clasky family in California, sees her young daughter, Cristina, enjoying the rich lifestyle, and starts to feel disturbed by it, fearing that perhaps her daughter is starting to forget all the old cultural traditions as she is seduced by wealth. There is one scene in this section of the film that, in its own way, sums up its subtle cultural conflict: an argument that develops between Flor and John Clasky (Adam Sandler, who gives another fine dramatic performance here), in which Flor accuses Mr. Clasky of flaunting wealth and being \\"smug,\\" and Mr. Clasky fires back at her, calling her a \\"hypocrite.\\" Why deny your daughter this life if she wants it?, he seems to be saying. <br /> <br />It is this kind of thematic questioning and ambivalence that gives SPANGLISH its real interest and unassuming power; it's why I think the movie is worth seeing, even though it isn't perfect. The character of Deborah Clasky---a caricature of neurosis and well-meaning insensitivity---is a serious (and not all that funny) flaw to Brooks' conception, since, as hard as Tea Leoni tries to humanize the character, her over-the-top neurotic well-meaning villainy threatens to reduce the central cultural conflict between affluence and tradition to a one-sided affair (I mean, which Mexican maid would really want their kid to grow up to be a Deborah Clasky? When you see the film, you'll see what I mean). And the final scene, between Flor and a gravely-disappointed Cristina, is a little disturbing in its implication that mere cultural pride trumps even getting a good education if offered it. <br /> <br />Still, I consider those flaws aberrations in what is essentially a searching film about whether becoming affluent does (or should) trump one's cultural roots. Because it provokes these kinds of interesting and thoughtful questions, SPANGLISH is a film worth seeing and reflecting. Recommended (with some reservations).
B0006399FS|3.0|I bought U2's \\"How To Dismantle An Atomic Bomb\\" in February this year or a whim after really liking the few singles I had already heard from it. U2 have always been somewhat of an enigma for me - sometimes I like them, sometimes I hate them. They are definitely an overrated band, because to me a lot of their material sounds the same and even their 'classics' don't really blow me away. I'm sure Bono is a great humanitarian and everything, but he's so full of himself and thinks that, like, U2 are the greatest band to ever rock the world! Hardcore U2 fans will see that statement as incredibly ironic, but it's not. Really not.<br /><br />After listening to this album in full, I am only semi-impressed. There's nothing that really blows me away, but there are some rather good songs. Ironically, these will turn out to all be the singles. This album proves U2 are still significant in today's music scene, because it sold more than 800,000 copies in the US in its first week of release, which is incredible for a band that have been going for 20 years. Sometimes I feel that this album was just hyped beyond belief, which is why so many people bought it. Some people would like to think the music on this album is deep, but for me it just isn't. For deep I look to Radiohead, Tori Amos and Bjork, not U2.<br /><br />\\"Vertigo\\" is the album's lead single and the band made the right choice in making it so. The video to this song is incredible, but the song itself is more superb. The guitars are strong and chunky as always in trademark U2-form. \\"Miracle Drug\\" is trademark U2 with epic guitars are beautiful soundscapes created by the undulating drums. \\"Sometimes You Can't Make It In Your Own\\" was a UK No.1 and is very similar to the previous song. This is Bono's tribute to his father who died in 2001. It's a great song and isn't much different from songs such as \\"One,\\" a true U2 classic. \\"Love And Peace Or Else\\" is Bono's anti-war statement about Iraq, and it's a great piece that reflects his state of mind on the subject. The sound is dark and gritty, like looking through green night vision into the deserts of the Middle East. \\"City Of Blinding Lights\\" is the third single from this album and is probably my favourite song from it. It gradually builds up with a catchy beat and rolling drums that climax in the chorus after the second minute. \\"All Because Of You\\" opens with a shattering, ear drum-piercing guitar that echoes for miles around. It's a heavy rock song in traditional U2 style with banging drums and funky lyrics.<br /><br />In my opinion, this is where the album starts to go down hill. \\"A Man And A Woman\\" is only an average song because it's so soft and bland. U2 are a stadium band and this song sounds like something Maroon 5 would do. \\"Crumbs From Your Table\\" is a good song with some great guitar work from The Edge, but apart from that this song is quite forgetful. \\"One Step Closer\\" is quite a beautiful love song that is soft and tranquil against your ears, but it never really takes off, which unfortunately makes it quite boring. \\"Original Of The Species\\" is the only really good song in the final half of the album, because it has a sweet, caressing beat that is almost lullaby in style. \\"Yahweh\\" is Bono's tribute to his God, which I can appreciate, but musically, it's another duff in my opinion. The album closes with \\"Fast Cars\\" which is a good song because it's an interesting change of pace from the rest of the album. It almost has a Spanish flair to it, which I think works well.<br /><br />OVERALL GRADE: 6/10<br /><br />One thing I know now is that I won't be buying any of U2's other albums any time soon. I mean I know they're a good band otherwise they wouldn't have lasted for over 20 years. I'm not stupid! I just don't feel like their music is something I connect to very well, so I'll stick with bands that I do connect with. Don't get me wrong, this album isn't bad, because it has some good tracks but it's not exactly the best piece of work I've ever heard.

B000021XR5|5.0|This time its the dark and brooding No.4 as Scott Weiland who was just released from rehab during this album, came back in a big way despite all the nagging of the critics, which doesn't really matter considering none of their albums were given their just due with the exception of possibly Purple, No.4 however was just another musical step for STP, this time trying for a bit of that Core sound, only more polished and with a more melodic edge, such as the hit song \\"Sour Girl\\" would show and others including, \\"Atlanta\\" and the hit single \\"Down\\", so whatever you do, DON'T LISTEN TO THE NEGATIVE REVIEWS, because people just don't know what they're talking about when it comes to this band, STP just progressed and tried something new everytime, which i admire huge, especially in 2005 when bands like Nickelback rule the charts.
0316776963|5.0|I was in a college course for Education majors about Sociocultural studies in education.  A classmate read the short story entitled \\"Jesus Shaves\\" from Sedaris' book.  The whole class was in stitches.  This particular piece is about Sedaris' struggles in an American school in Paris where the students (all from differing cultures) are struggling with the concept of Christianity.  I thought this story was absolutely hilarious and was on a mission to purchase the book for myself and read the rest of Sedaris' anecdotes. <br /> <br />Upon actually procuring the book, I learned that the theme of the book is sort of an autobiographical sketch of Sedaris' own trials and tribulations in life, starting with his problems in primary school (talking about his lisp) and extending into his adulthood (with situations dealing with his sexuality). <br /> <br />The book is wrought with humor, some more off color than others... for instance \\"Big Boy\\" is an entire story about a piece of excrement.  Don't let this scare you away, though.  Weaved into each of Sedaris' tales is a lesson to be learned, though presented in a comical manner.   <br /> <br />After having my mom read \\"Jesus Shaves\\" she confronted me with the usual, \\"What did you take from this?,\\" and gave me insight to a more morally based meaning of Sedaris' retoric.  Thinking back, all of his tales in this book have a deeper, more serious message that we all can learn from, and appreciate.

055357342X|5.0|After having read several of Jordan's books, I picked up this series while in Iraq, and haven't bothered to finish the Wheel of Time series.  I got to the seventh book in the Wheel of Time (Path of Daggers maybe?) and just couldn't trudge any further along in the series.  A friend had read these books, so I ordered them and I couldn't put them down.  The entire series so far is in my top 3 for any fiction I have read.  I love the entire series, especially the way Martin develops the characters.  A few of the reviews talk about soap operas, but I don't get that feeling at all.  I love seeing how some of the bad characters (Jaime) may not really be that bad.  It also looks like Cersei will have a POV in the new book, and I think that will be very interesting, because I have hated her from the beginning of the series.   <br /> <br />   I am currently re-reading the series in anticipation of the next book's release and am discovering how much I missed by flying through so fast the first time.  There are so many people to keep track of, it is hard to remember details about someone 1000 pages later.  Unless you have a photographic memory (or at least a better memory than me :-)  I suggest re-reading the series as well.  There is a lot to be gained from knowing who certain minor characters really are after getting through the books. <br /> <br />   Anyways, the entire series has my highest recommendation and if you are a Jordan fan, just stop now.  Martin has him beat ten times over.  My only hope is that this series doesn't turn into a Wheel of Time, but I don't think it will since the first three books of this series are better than Jordan's.
0451457994|5.0|The novel begins with the placement of a mysterious black monolith on Earth millions of years ago, which, although seemingly dormant, is secretly at working, probing and provoking the human species. Then in 2001, a similar black monolith is discovered on the moon. It emits an eerie signal out into the solar system. Dave Bowman and Frank Poole are dispatched aboard the Discovery, along with some deep-sleeping crewmates, to investigate. Thus, a great adventure begins. <br /> <br />     This is a wonderfully told story about exploring the vast and beautiful solar system and ultimately exploring our origins. Clarke does a fine job indicating the beauty and wonder of the cosmos. As Discovery travels farther than any man-made vehicle has before, we see the same magnificent wonders as Bowman and Poole, such as the wonderful moons of Jupiter or the rings of Saturn.  <br /> <br />     Although there isn't a vast amount of character development in terms of Bowman and Poole, this doesn't really detract from the story as one might fear. We do get a sense of their lonely and isolated lives on the ship Discovery and we see the characters bouts of joy, sadness, boredom and anxiety as they make their bold journey. Of course, a major character is HAL 9000, the computer which never sleeps and has control over the happenings of Discovery. In his own way, he ends up being the most interesting character as his actions have a serious effect on the course of the novel.  <br /> <br />     The novel moves along at a nice pace and is easy to read. Although giving some indication of the science and technology of the voyage, it doesn't get bogged down in technical details. Yet, it addresses the beauty of the cosmos and as one reads the story, it's easy to feel the awe-inspiring nature of the heavens.  <br /> <br />     The novel has a rather nice ending which leaves plenty of room for speculation and wonder. It's really quite thought-provoking, addressing a question man has asked for ages\\"Why are we here for and what's the meaning of life?\\" The reader is left with a sense of the vast magnitude of the universe and the questions its beauty brings about. <br /> <br />    If you have any interest in this at all, I'd say it's worth reading. If you're like me, you have an appreciation for the beauty and wonder of the universe and our place in it and this novel really addresses that. This is a great story.
B000002JSJ|4.0|Presence, one their second to last albums is what many consider one of the signs of the end for Led Zeppelin. Some parts of this album make me disagree. It's like Zep on bi-polar disorder. Some songs are incredible, while others are repetitive and boring. On the whole This album is a step more bluesey than Physical Graffiti, their last record and showcases the talents of John Bonham (drummer), and John Paul Jones (bassist) very well (always true, I guess). It seems that as the band matured the rythym section only got better and better.  <br /> <br />The guitars and lyrics are great as usual, but some songs just lack that riff variety that graces other Zeppelin albums. <br />I never cared for Royal Orleans or Candy Store Rock. These songs really have nothing special. Heres my song analysis. <br /> <br />1. Achillies Last Stand: 10/10 Best song on the album. AN EPIC battle song with probably the best driving rythym beat since Immigrant Song. Amazing lyrical preformance ala Plant. Worth buying the album for just this song. <br /> <br />2. For Your Life: 8.5/10 This song has grown on me. Lyrics are a little interesting. Most of the song is only alright, the solos and chorus section make it worth listening to. <br /> <br />3. Royal Orleans: 6/10 A disappointment. Sure its an okay song, but the zep could do better. Boring guitar riff and song structure. <br /> <br />4. Nobody's Fault but Mine: 10/10 AH. The Zep return to blues. With may I add, great results. The effects-laden introduction sends shivers down my spine everytime I hear it. Thunderous drumming from Bonham. MAD PROPS FOR THE HARMONICA SOLO. <br /> <br />5. Candy Store Rock: 6/10 Another mediocre guitar riff. The lyrics are plain annoying. <br /> <br />6. Hots on For Nowhere: 8.5/10 By this time this song structure is getting repetitive. Sounds an awful lot like Royal Orleans. A good vocal performance is what sets it apart. Riff doesn't get old after 3 seconds. <br /> <br />7. Tea for One: 7.5/10 The slowest Zep blues song since Led Zeppelin III. Pretty good, but we've heard this before! Listen to its cousin Since I've Been Loving You. Much better. <br /> <br />Overall, if you like Led Zeppelin and are an experienced veteran, you'll find plenty of good things about this album. Not one to listen to if you're just getting to know the band.

B0007Y08I8|4.0|\\"Team America: World Police\\" is funny parody and highly original.  I don't really care what the political leanings are of Trey Parker, who makes fun of everybody on all sides.  What really makes this film, though, is the puppets.  I have never seen a puppet movie like this before.  An action movie a la Bruckheimer with puppets is hysterical, as the puppets can only dangle and crash into each other during fight scenes.  The sex scenes are shockingly funny, too.<br /><br />There is something here to offend everybody.  It's not for every movie goer, and definitely this is not a family movie.  But I enjoyed it, and it is now one of my guilty pleasures.<br /><br />The DVD has some wonderful \\"making of\\" scenes, showing how the puppeteers made the film come to life.  Watch closely for the \\"found objects\\" in the various locales, such as dollar bills used as palm leaves.
B0000027F8|4.0|\\"Listen without prejudice\\" - a rather strange name for an album by a guy that was at the top of his game when this was released. People were anything but prejudiced towards George Michael at the time. He was a hit-making machine that had also turned into an international object of lust for women all over the world. The expectations from people of this album were extremely high - especially after the monster success of \\"Faith\\" - George Michael's first solo effort. Not only were the expectations high. People expected \\"Faith Vol.2\\". Listening to the album once is enough to convince listeners that this is clearly not \\"Faith Vol. 2\\". In fact, it offers a stark contrast to \\"Faith\\" both in the themes of its songs as well as the overall sound.<br /><br /> The songs are lyrically strong and well-crafted. The music is more stripped down. This is evident on tracks like \\"Heal the pain\\", \\"Something to save\\", and \\"Waiting for that day\\". This is the first album on which George Michael sheds the huskiness of his voice for something substantially smoother and pleasant. Some may feel like this album is a rather \\"heavy\\" affair. I truly believe that the songs sound better when listened to separately or when mixed with songs by other artists. They stand out better when listened along with other music. Listening to the whole album at once may be a little too much for some people. That being said, this album is still a solid effort despite its departure from a sound people typically associate with George Michael.<br /><br />  Those that craved for \\"Faith 2\\" would have to wait till 1996's \\"Older\\" (the perfect sequel to \\"Faith\\").<br /><br />Songs for the casual listener: Soul Free<br /><br />Songs for the George Michael fan: Something to save, Cowboys and Angels,Soul Free, Mother's Pride
B00079HZUM|5.0|Though Stage Beauty is based on the same general theme of women portraying themselves being taboo as Shakespeare in Love, I found the latter film to be a bit slow and less engrossing than this one.  Stage Beauty has so much going on that it's impossible to tear yourself away from the screen for a moment, thus the joys of owning it on video are quite apparent.<br /><br />I love Billy Crudup, not only as eye candy, but because he can actually act.  His versatility has long amazed me in so many movies, but in this one he shows several different sides as stage actor Ned Kynaston who has built a career out of playing women since his childhood.  He is the reigning star of the theater as he plays Desdemona in Othello and is considered the greatest female actor by his peers.  His dresser Maria (played above and beyond even my expectations by Claire Danes) is silently in love with him and copies his every gesture and movement backstage each night before running off to mimick his role at an underground theater as well.<br /><br />Upon discovering that Ned is so feminine from his theatrical training that she catches him having a tryst with the Duke of Buckingham (Ben Chaplin), she is determined to steal his thunder and his role upon King Charles II's (Rupert Everett) repeal of the longstanding law forbidding women from portraying themselves at the insistence of his coercive cockney accented mistress Nell Gwynn (Zoe Tapper) who also wants to act.  This puts the beautifl Ned and several other male actors who played women out of business, and Maria Hughes quickly becomes the talk of the theatrical community as she takes over Ned's role as Desdemona.  Things go from bad to worse as Ned cannot find work, especially after a beating from the ruthless, lecherous Sir Charles Sedley (Richard Griffiths) who makes Ned pay for a bawdy trick he'd played on him, and he ends up working in cheap taverns.<br /><br />The silver lining is that Maria can't act as well as she thought, and she needs Ned to help her master the role as Desdemona as much as he needs to learn how to come to terms with his own arrogance and masculinity.  Wonderful things happen for both of them, but I won't spoil it for you if you haven't seen it.  There is so much going on in this movie that you will literally be glued to your seat.  The characters and script are as colorful and beautiful as the scenery and the costumes.  Save for a bad love scene in a barn--Crudup and Danes don't convey much chemistry--and the way in which Ned is busy deciding if he prefers men or women, Stage Beauty is a sheerly entertaining joy to behold.  Billy Crudup was once expected to be the next Brad Pitt, but it's rather fortunate for him that he's not; the critics still take him seriously and, with a brave role such as this on his resume', that factor is completely to his advantage.  After all, this is most decidedly his film.  The rest of the cast is excellent as well, and you get the sense that everyone involved enjoyed this project.  Pick it up today and fall in love like I did.  Outstanding!needs Ned to help her master the role as Desdemona as much as he needs to learn how to come to terms with his own arrogance and masculinity.

After all, this is most decidedly his film.  The rest of the cast is excellent as well, and you get the sense that everyone involved enjoyed this project.  Pick it up today and fall in love like I did.  Outstanding!
B000000H57|5.0|This album is by far Type O Negative's best.  While some reviewers and fans claimed that it was also their \\"sell-out\\" album, due to both the shorter song lengths (in comparison to earlier albums) and the cutesy intro and \\"goodbye\\" tracks, this album is the most lyrical and displays the most appreciation of, shall we say, \\"the human spirit\\" of all of their albums.   <br />  <br />While it may seem ridiculous to claim that any Type O Negative album shows any kind of positive spirit at all, it is definitely precisely that which makes this - in my opinion - the great album that it is.  The album (which, for greater appreciation, must be listened to in its entirety at least once) focuses on the connection between man's spirit and the physical world.  It has a very \\"Wiccan\\" feel to it, and draws heavily on classical mythology (from references to Bacchus  all the way to the Green Man).   <br />  <br />It is definitely worth a listen.

B0007GAEW6|3.0|As has been said, why the hell did TMV waste their talent like this? <br /> <br />Deloused was AMAZINGAMAZINGAMAZING! Their wailing rock was so emotional and heatfelt, the prog adding originality and experimentalism to their whole idea. It was a real CD, a great CD. <br /> <br />Frances the Mute seems a half-assed attempt to please the label by releasing some bull**** that posers and pretend fans will eat up.  <br />This is my guess of how the cd was made...Spend a day writing a moving song, the Mars Volta style everyone loves...Well, we don't have to write that much, just a basic verse or two with a hook that we can repeat...Then leave the computer on and play with the sound to see what creepy effects we can make for the remaining 20 minutes of the song. <br /> <br />THe widow is an ok song on its own. The first half has some good rock to it. But who wants to spend the leftover 3 minutes listening to some electronic wailing noises which you might expect to hear as a soundtrack to a haunted house. <br /> <br />I won't give up that easy on a band with this much talent though, so while Mars volta remains high in my book, they really are cutting it close. <br />Dont buy this CD&lt; buy deloused

B0007OCG4W|2.0|Boy was I disappointed by this purportedly \\"deep\\" film.  It is about relationships between silly self-important yuppies, with few real responsibilities except to their careers and their fantasies about themselves.  None of them care particularly for the ones they are involved with, but instead are consumed by their own ideals of love.  So instead of working on their relationships, they seek perfection.  This has been done before, and better by others.  The only thing that saves this film from total mediocrity is the actors, who really are good.  It's just that the script offered little and the direction virtually nothing.<br /><br />Nichols is mainstream, but wants to have the cache of an Indie filmmaker.  Alas, he can't have it both ways and so relies on stars to sell the film with their sex appeal.  Idiotic, stilted dialogue passes for depth, and abrupt time shifts - where relationship shuffling must be explained - destroy the realism.<br /><br />Not recommended.
B0007Y4TVU|2.0|Other than BYOB this album is fairly disposable. I wasnt even going to buy this album, but after a few listens to BYOB i thought it could be a pretty good listen. I was wrong in thinking this. Daron Malakian's voice i just cannot take. System of a Down has talent, but they dont utilize it here. They're at their best when playing off-timed songs with good chorus and vocals from Serj (who by the way is in good form on this album) I guess I would like this album a ton more if Malakian would just sing in the background or not at all. It just doesnt work for me. I strongly recommend the self titled or Toxicity over this one, maybe the forthcoming \\"Hypnotize\\" album will be better than this one
0786711647|4.0|I don't want to spoil the plot of this book by giving away too many details. Basically, \\"A Kiss Before Dying\\" tells the story of a very ambitious man who is faced with a problem: he's managed to get his girlfriend Dorothy pregnant, and he'll stop at nothing in order to make his problem disappear...even if it means murder.<br /><br />This novel is a quick read, and it's very suspenseful. Just when you think you have the whole thing figured out, Ira Levin throws another shocking curveball your way, which keeps you wondering until the very end. If you're a fan of mystery/suspense novels, this is one of the best in its class.<br /><br />(Note: this is the second Levin book that I've read, \\"The Stepford Wives\\" being the first. Even though I think \\"A Kiss Before Dying\\" is a great book, I just couldn't get into it as much as \\"Stepford Wives.\\" That's probably just because of my personal preference, though...and I still highly recommend this book.)
B000002AP1|4.0|Well im not gonna go into the remix, because i never had the opportunity to hear the original version to even compare the remix to. But seriously, where have I been the past 33 years? The 24 years ive been alive and Ive never ventured into the world of Iggy Pop and the Stooges. I regret every minute I wasted. This album is so full of force and intensity. I read that the band was falling apart during the making of this album, and you can feel the tension being put into the music. Iggy's vocals are just so darn good, I cant even describe it. Why have I wasted my life not listening to this album? Someone slap me
0064471047|5.0|C.S. Lewis pioneered a new kind of fantasy when he wrote \\"The Lion, The Witch and the Wardrobe\\" -- the kind where people from our world somehow get swept into another one. It's old stuff now, but Lewis was among the first to attempt such a thing. Because of its originality, and despite some rather hamhanded allegory, it remains a charmingly written, classic story.<br /><br />To avoid the threat of bombings in London, the four Pevensie kids are sent to stay with a wealthy, eccentric professor in the country. But strange things start to happen when Lucy finds a wardrobe during a game of hide-and-seek -- when she climbs in, she finds a snowy woodland and a friendly faun. Her siblings don't believe her... until peevish Edmund also ventures through, and encounters the beautiful but evil White Witch.<br /><br />Soon all four are wandering through the snowy land of Narnia, encountering mythical creatures and talking animals. They also find that the four of them are at the center of a prophecy that will lead to the return of lion-messiah Aslan, and the downfall of the White Witch. But things don't go according to plan when Edmund defects to the Witch's side...<br /><br />How many fantasy stories are written about kids who crawl through a hedge, wander through a door or pick up a magical object, and immediately are swept off into a medieval land? Lots. And they owe a debt of gratitude to C.S. Lewis, theologian, author, and drinking buddy of \\"Lord of the Rings\\" author J.R.R. Tolkien.<br /><br />C.S. Lewis' story is, despite being set during World War II, very 19th-century in tone -- very charming, conversational and full of little details. He populates it with a mishmash of mythic creatures such as dryads, fauns, and talking beavers. The one flaw? Lewis gets quite hamhanded with his Christian allegory, such as Aslan's resurrection. However, he has a very good plot and charming characters to balance it out.<br /><br />Those characters deftly avoid being cutesy, especially by virtue of the malicious Edmund, who slowly has a change of heart after falling in with the evil Witch. He's a much more enjoyable character than his noble brother Peter, just because he's so real. And as a counterbalance, there's Lewis's sweet-natured Lucy -- which was also the name of Lewis' granddaughter.<br /><br />Complex characters and still-fresh stories give \\"The Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe\\" -- which is soon to be released as a major movie -- a special ambience. Definitely worth reading.esy, especially by virtue of the malicious Edmund, who slowly has a change of heart after falling in with the evil Witch.

B000062YB1|5.0|This is awesome. This is the Slayer album that has something for every one. If you like the slower more midpace tempos of South of heaven youll like Blood Red, Expendable Youth, Dead Skin mask, Skeletons of Society, Temptation, and Seasons in The Abyss If yourr a speed freak, you will enjoy War Ensemble, Spirit In Black, Hollowed Point, and Born of Fire. The Solo's on South of heaven were amazing. These are even better. Every song is brutal, Every song is heavy. I think it is Slayers second best album. Reign in Blood being their best. 666
B000002NZO|5.0|I used to have this little gem on 8track, and haven't heard it in quite some time. I played the samples on this site, and it all came back to me. Although, I do own Archive,vol.I, which includes \\"Stagnation,\\" and \\"Dusk\\"(my personal \\"Trespass\\" favorite), the whole thing in context is a very under-rated piece of work. To me, it has sentimental value, and I would recommend this  to any serious person who isn't sure whether or not to acquire it.
B00005JKQ6|5.0|1968 was the year for a bumper crop of weird movies. <br />I am not going to be a spoiler  and  summarize the movie. Indeed my advice to you if you are interested in watching this movie is try not to read any reviews because   to enjoy the full power of the movie you have to let yourself be surprised. <br />I will say this. It begins with Burt Lancaster swimming in a swimming pool in an affluent New England town and the film follows him as he swims from one cement swimming pool to the next. Lancaster is brilliant in the movie   and   the photography is stunning. <br /> If you enjoy intelligent offbeat movies you will probably enjoy this one.          <br />
B000268QB2|5.0|My disclaimer first:  I've passed 40, and am hardly at the cutting edge of musical trends anymore.  Twenty years ago I ate, slept, and breathed music, and had opinions to spew out to anyone who would listen.  Now my reviews must be accompanied by a potent dose of humility.  I'm no longer in a position to judge how original or innovative is this record, relative to others' output. <br /> <br />But I will say this;  If I'd heard more recordings like this one in recent years, I would have been inspired to pay a lot more attention. <br /> <br />I was first drawn to this band by the grandly beautiful \\"Somewhere Only We Know,\\" that rarity among popular songs, in that I found myself scanning the radio searching deliberately for it.  It had everything -- wonderful composition, terrific execution.  Chaplin leaping up to the top of the minor seventh to sing the choruses, and the gorgeous way the melody winds down at the end.  Paul McCartney himself would be proud of that song (I find myself wondering occasionally if Sir Paul has heard this one, as I would bet it would appeal to him.) <br /> <br />I assumed this band might well be a one-hit wonder until I heard them play a live concert on a local radio station recently, and I then realized how much else they could do. That performance convinced me to buy the record.   <br /> <br />It feels good to be excited about a new band again. <br /> <br />It's hard to describe music in a way that informs a listener.  You will like this if you appreciate clever songwriting with an attention to both coherent melody and some harmonic originality.  The instrumentation is all keyboards, voice and drums, with the variety of keyboards creating a smooth, pleasant sound.  The piano playing has a fair amount of octave playing in it, almost reminiscent of Rachmaninoff. I suspect that Rice-Oxley must have had a decent classical training. <br /> <br />This is simply an astonishing record.  I still believe the first song to be the best one, but the craftsmanship throughout the record is amazing.  Keane has an incredible gift for irresistible climactic chorus-writing.  I also love their patience.  They don't show their full hand at the beginning of a song, but rather compose competent and workmanlike verses that build up to really shimmering high points.   <br /> <br />Chaplin's voice is hauntingly beautiful, especially when he reaches for a high note and delivers it with accuracy and passion.  I don't know quite how to describe it other than to say that it's rare to simply enjoy the sound of a singer's voice so much. <br /> <br />Rice-Oxley is obviously responsible for a lot of the musical effect.  It's he who drives Somewhere Only We Know to great heights, and it's also he who plays with such restraint and purpose on the tunes that are dominated by Chaplin's singing.  On first listen, I was struck by Chaplin's voice, but on the second, I had decided that Rice-Oxley was really the genius in the band. <br /> <br />Having said that, however, one shouldn't overlook the degree to which certain songs depend utterly on Chaplin's voice. Each of We Might As Well Be Strangers, She Has No Time, Sunshine, and Untitled I are really vehicles for showcasing his voice to a different effect, and would have little meaning apart from Chaplin's delivery.   <br /> <br />And, truly, if Chaplin hadn't recorded Somewhere Only We Know so beautifully, I probably would never have bought this record. <br /> <br />The album has a curious symmetry to it.  It begins with the majestic Somewhere Only We Know, and ends with the most dramatic cut, Bedshaped.  The second and third tunes somewhat resemble each other, as do the second and third ones from the end.  (This is the Last Time, and Bend and Break, are both up-tempo, lyrical poppish pieces that follow directly after one another.  Sunshine and Untitled I, which appear near the end, are ethereal, mysterious pieces built upon an eerie filtering and doubling of Chaplin's voice.)  In between, the pace of the album seems very modulated, as though the symmetry is an intentional effect. <br /> <br />A few comments on the pieces in turn: <br /> <br />Somewhere Only We Know -- The best song on the album, and one of the finest pop songs I've ever heard <br /> <br />This is the Last Time -- Up-tempo pop piece with a terrific chorus, beautifully sung by Chaplin.   <br /> <br />Bend and Break -- Similar, and I actually like it a little better.  But the chorus requires similar performance skills from Chaplin, and gets them.  Love to hear him reach for the higher notes starting the chorus. <br /> <br />We Might as well be Strangers -- The melody seems so inconsequential, but I love this piece.  It's all about Chaplin ascending a kind of musical staircase, with a terrific climax the second time he gets to the top. The theme of lost love is an old one but here it seems to carry a precise meaning unique to this song. <br /> <br />Everybody's Changing -- After Somewhere Only We Know, the catchiest song on the album.   <br /> <br />Your Eyes Open -- One of the less exceptional compositions on the album, it's made memorable by the perfect match of the melody in the chorus and the effect applied to Chaplin's voice.  A sugary smooth sound, if that makes any sense. <br /> <br />She Has No Time -- Oh, so quiet and delicate, with Chaplin singing in a high falsetto.  It took me a few listens, but I now think this is one of the very best songs on the album, certainly among the most beautiful. <br /> <br />Can't Stop Now -- Catchy, this is probably one of the few times on the album where Chaplin's noisy inhalations become a distraction.  He often gets right up to the line of over-emoting, and on this cut he crossed it.  A nice tune, though, and the chorus has its moments.  Still a great cut. <br /> <br />Sunshine -- Someone described this sweet, ethereal piece as a shaft of a light in a dark room, and it fits perfectly. <br /> <br />Untitled I -- Sunshine's slightly more mysterious counterpart. Again, a bit glimmering, even spooky. <br /> <br />Bedshaped -- This is one of the more dramatic, bombastic pieces on the album.  I haven't quite figured out yet what it is all about, but it is definitely not a shy piece. <br /> <br />If I had to pick the best songs on the record, I'd probably select:  Somewhere Only We Know, She Has No Time, Bend and Break.  But This is the Last Time and Everybody's Changing are both absolutely terrific and catchy songs also, and I have a real soft spot for We Might as Well Be Strangers. <br /> <br />I find myself hoping that Keane remains very disciplined about their craft and expanding their horizons.  They have tremendous songwriting and performing ability; their task now is to explore beyond the sound they have perfected, and really bring all of their creative talents to bear.  If they do, they could be a band for the ages. <br /> <br />  <br />
B0007OCG4W|1.0|The only reason I sat through the whole thing was because I had nothing better to do, and I kept thinking \\"it HAS to get better... it can't be this bad all the way through and have such a good actor base to it\\"!!! but alas, I was wrong.  The plot was HORRIBLE... the acting was HORRIBLE... the content was HORRIBLE- are you beginning to see a HORRIBLE pattern??  after it was over, I sat back and asked myself what the point was to the movie... I couldn't come up with one. It should come with a warning to viewers about the innappropriate content- above and beyond the R- rating.   It was a very disappointing movie overall- Please SAVE YOURSELF!!!
B000850IHW|5.0|'Free Hand' has always been my fave GG release, but I've had to live with a rather shoddy sounding One Way CD reissue that has diminished my enjoyment of the music. That is until now. These 35th Anniversary remasters are all supervised by GG vocalist Derek Shulman with loving attention to detail.  <br /> <br />'Just The Same,' 'On Reflection,' 'Free Hand' - this is a masterpiece of creativity & artistry. In their day, GG was untouchable by all other prog bands (and they still are!). The vocal & instrumental counterpoint of 'On reflection' can finally be heard as it should be. I am left breathless by it. If you are a GG fan, then you should make it imperitive to buy this CD (and all the remasters) right away. If you are just a casual aquaintance, or curious about all the fuss, then this is as good a place as any to experience the majesty that was Gentle Giant-all hail the power and the glory!!! Michael Bettine
B000062YAZ|5.0|This is Slayers Best album. The riffs are fast. The solo's wail like a banshee, The vocals are great, the drums are fast, The lyrics are sick. This is an amazing thrash metal album. If you like this, go out and buy seasons in the abyss, Hell awaits is pretty brutal too.
0893815233|1.0|Great photography - bad ethics. Some artists don't think they have a duty to society. I think we do. Art has the power to transform...
B00005JO9J|5.0|This is my ABSOLUTE FAVORITE new show of the season--the chemistry between the actors is outstanding (particularly between Drs Shepherd and Grey) and the music fits perfectly with the show. It has introduced me to so many fabulous new artists. As someone in medical school, I particularly appreciate that it portrays the interns as real people with very real insecurities and tough decisions to make.   I hope ABC is considering releasing a Soundtrack for season 1. This is also the first medical drama that I can remember in which 3 women are the main characters--its about time!! I literally cannnot wait for Season 2...

1558908366|5.0|I think you all have forgotton one important fact. It's a movie!!! And it does not imply postitution is ok and fabulous. Why else would they write into the script the scene where the hooker is found dead in a dumpster, and the other hookers being addicts, and using money for drugs instead of rent. What makes it a love story is Gere rescues roberts from that kind of life, in which she didn't ever say she liked it or was proud, she wanted to get out of that life for good. As far as the girbil remark, don't believe everything you read in the tabloids or on CNN. And to say no rich guy has ever picked up a hooker. Ha! What world are you living in. Hugh Grant had a beautiful actress girlfriend waiting for him at home (Elizabeth Hurely!!), while he picked up a trashy diseased african american hooker in hollywood. And when Heidi Fleiss was running the high class prostitution company in hollywood do you seriously think no actors ever called. Hundreds did but she never gave names but we do know that Charlie Sheen admited to his picking up prositiutes back in the day. Just because you're rich and good looking it doesn't mean you'd never pay for sex. I'm sure 90 percent of all men have been with a hooker at least once and if you say never have you're probably lying. And yes Roberts is way too good looking to be a street walker. But it's just a movie. Every hooker's dream, to end up like cinderella. It's just a flick and a romantic tale about two similar people who fall in love, and if you paid close attention, gere did treat roberts well throughout the movie. He stuck up for her and told her she could be so much more. And she only took the money because she thought she could be professional and leave with no tears, because she didnt believe they could have a real life together until he proves her wrong at the end. Didn't you see the part when her feelings were hurt, after being propositioned by stuckie and she didnt take the money? That's called self respect because no money isworth being treated like you're nothing. You need to read between the lines if you want to understand the message in this movie. If you're smart, don't take things too seriously. I think Roberts is a fine actress and she really did a great job acting like a hooker at the beginning but then we realize she's a great person too who made some bad desicions in her life because we all have. She was gorgeous and adorable in this movie and it's a classic.
B00002MZ4W|5.0|Fiona Apple is an artistic genius. I love this album for it's depth, honesty, poetry, and intensity of spirit. The way Fiona's voice cracks at the end of the song, I Know, is hearbreaking. And the way Fiona compairs one way love with anorexia in the song Paper Bag is ingenius. I wish there were more artists like this out there on the scene today. Fiona Apple, Tori Amos, Corinna Fugate, and Vanessa Carlton stand as one of a kind songwriters. I hope they release Fiona Apple's new CD soon! I will be the first to buy it! Free Fiona!
B00000JGHL|3.0|When I read the list of the actors in \\"City Hall\\" I expected a lot, but somehow the movie lacked something to make it lasting. It's not the acting and it's not the story, they are all ok, but they don't lift the movie to the level that most Pacino or Cusack movies have. For the real fans of these two the movie is worth watching, but it won't be remembered in the next decades I think. <br /> <br />The political side I think is also not a new story, even Pacino himself has played on more movies about the same theme, but in Serpico he was a lot better.

Nathanial is soon in over his head and full of regrets.     I thought this book was wonderfull. I loved the way it was written and I enjoyed Bartimaeus's sarcastic comments throughout the book. I would suggest it to anyone. (please forgive me for anything I misspelled!)
B0000AGQ6Y|1.0|...thing about this uncut version on such a masterpiece that \\"Leon\\" indeed is; These two version tells two very different stories. But; I wish I had never seen the uncut version having previously seen only the \\"international Leon\\" (and make that several times). This version (the uncut) turned the father-figure that Leon eventually becomes (perhaps no rolemodel, but...) in the international version into a \\"lover\\" of some kind. Of course, he and the little girl don't have sex -but still I couldn't help watching helplessly the entire movie (both tense and gripping) fall apart! No wonder why the movie was edited in the first place, and I am shocked to read here that most reviewers find this to be the ultimate version of the movie... It's ok to be a fan, but this... was bad! Had I known this I'd bought myslf a copy of \\"Lolita\\" instead -so just press your \\"no\\"-buttons below here, I'm not trying to act like a saint -but I find no excuse for this perversion!  <br /> <br />One star for the uncut-version, four for the international (it used to be five until this ruined the entire image of \\"Leon\\"). <br /> <br />(Oldman is fantastic by the way, I have to add this!)
B000002552|2.0|I love Bob Dylan and I Love The Band. I was extremly surprised to hear how poor this colaboration of the two was.  With a few exceptions, The only good tracks on this album are already the bonus tracks on the much better Band albums \\"THe Band\\" and \\"Music From Big pink.\\" If you are considering this album I suggest those albums and then the album dylan did with the Band called \\"Planet Waves.\\"  This album is only appropraite for extreme Dylan fans who need this album to fill out their collection. For others I am sorry to say this album doesn't cut it and should never have been released. <br /> <br />Hopefully I will save you 20$
B00005NGZX|5.0|I really didn't know what to think when I first heard this album.  I'd already had \\"you fail me\\" for a couple of months, and I got to thoroughly enjoying that after a little while, so I figured I'd pick this one up as well.  The first track \\"concubine\\" starts the album off quickly, and it's unrelenting from there.  I honestly don't know what it is about converge that I like so much, but I love everything that I've heard from them.  I'll admit that you can't really decipher what jacob bannon is saying from his vocals (that's why they created lyric books though), but the music is so fast paced and frenetic that I really don't mind that much.  I'm not certain whether or not I like this better than \\"you fail me\\", but it's putting up a pretty good fight in the early going.  Stand out tracks (in my opinion) are concubine, homewrecker, jane doe, and distance and meaning.
0316168815|5.0|The Lovely Bones is remarkable as a debut novel and beautiful as a piece of (post?)modern literature.  As with her memoir Lucky, Sebold succeeds here in infuriating the reader with the violence and injustice still endured by so many women.  Also, I like her idea of heaven- a remarkable dreamscape that seems a thousand times more meaningful than the \\"silly place\\" (sorry- I know Monty Python is a bit out of place here) I grew up hearing about where evangelical Christians store up \\"mansions.\\"  Congratulations to Ms. Sebold; I think this book is destined for the canon of contemporary American literature.
B00005JKNC|4.0|I was afraid at times that \\"The Majectic\\" would get bogged down by it's good intentions.  The film tackles alot of heavy themes(Post-war trauma, McCarthyism, etc.) that it seemed like it was straight-jacketed by it's lofty goals.  It would also help if director Frank Darabont would learn how to tighten up his stories.  This film and \\"The Green Mile\\" are good films but they're not \\"War and Peace\\".  Just as I was about to write this film off as a noble failure it rebounds with a strong last third.  The ending is Capra-esque but, hey, imitation is the sincerest form of flattery.  The film contains many nice moments but it's the little touches that resonated with me; the pictures of the town's young men lost in the great war, the unveiling of the statue commemorating the war casualties.  Jim Carrey, in an understated performance, hit's all the right notes as Peter Appleton, disgraced screenwriter mistaken for someone else.  Martin Landau was exceptional as Harry, the grieving father who want's to believe that Carrey is his son returning from war.  I particularly liked Gerry Black as Emmit, a black man nursing wounds from his own experience in World War I.  Lest I forget, Bruce Campbell,\\"King of the B's\\", has a bit in the film's \\"Sand Pirates of the Sahara\\" sequence.  Not a great picture, but one well worth checking out.
0375507256|3.0|Cloud Atlas takes place over a few centuries.  It's organized such that the first story continues in the last story, the second story continues in the second-to-last story, etc.  They all tie together (so you want to read the chapters in order), though not very tightly.  I felt there was no grand unifying plot line to act as glue.  Any two adjacent stories were interrelated through some object or person, but that was all.  It's also less captivating at the start, as you're introduced to wildly different stories, and don't really see the connections until you reach the midpoint and start going backward in time. <br /> <br />I think Mitchell displayed a great ability to paint realistic pictures of societies in the different time frames.  It was amazing how he shifted from one style to the next, through  different narrators.
B0002858YS|5.0|The first time I heard the Killers song Mr. Brightside on the radio I immediatly drove to tower records and bought their CD and i must say i was not dissapointed when I heard it in fact it made the Killers my new favorete band. This CD incorperates a mixture of pop rock with a bit of 80's upbeat tempo mixed in. If you enjoy bands like the postal service and franz ferdinand then you will absolutly love the Killers !!!
B000127LW2|5.0|Star Trek Voyager is by far my personal favorite of the Star Trek lineage, and I whole heartedly recommend it, but why is it so expensive? $50 or $60, I'd understand, but about $100 a pop???
B0006J28BO|4.0|I wonder if it's OK to have a temporary crush on a cat. Not a real cat, an animated cat that dresses in a grey suit, drinks tea, and is voiced by Cary Elwes. I'm talking about none other then The Baron in The Cat Returns. The Baron is this really neato cat that helps save the heroine from having to get married to the Cat Prince. When Haru saves the Cat Prince from getting run over by a car the Cat Kingdom is eternally grateful. They send her presents like mice in her locker. The cat ambassador of sorts thinks that she agrees to marry the Cat Prince and stay in the Cat Kingdom. The cats are going to take her away that night when she hears a voice telling her to find a white cat and ask him to take her to the Cat Bureau. There she meets the dashing Baron, the crow voiced by Elliott Gould, and gets to know more about the white cat, voiced by Peter Boyle. As she is whisked away to the Cat Kingdom and faced to marry the prince, the Baron, Toto the crow, and Muta, the white cat have to save her. During her time in the Cat Kingdom she begins to turn into a cat making it all the more important that she leave the Cat Kingdom before the change is permanent!<br /><br />Also of note: Tim Curry does the voice of the evil Cat King! Anne  Hathaway does the voice of Haru. It took me a while to get used to Anne Hathaway's voice because I recognize it from some of the other films she has been involved in.<br /><br />It was SUCH a cool movie! Of course I would think so because it involves cats but still! The director, Hiroyuki Morita, is sort of a protegee of Hayao Miyazaki and  Nozomu Takahashi (the two directors that alternate directing Studio Ghibli films as I learned in the Special Feature section :) ). I really liked this movie and hope that Hiroyuki Morita continues to produce more great movies.
B00005JNTZ|5.0|Veronica Mars is a student at Neptune High School who's best friend, Lilly Kane, was murdered, her mom has jumped town, she has been raped, her boyfriend has abruptly broke up with her, and she's an outcast because her father wrongly (maybe) accused her dead best friend's dad with being the murderer. And that's just what we learn from the first episode. The next twenty-one episode revolve around Veronica trying to find out why her mom left and where she went to, who raped her, and who killed Lilly. The later of which could have been almost anyone who came into contact with the youngest Kane, and Veronica just happen to have a file on every one of them.    When Veronica's not looking for her mom or Lilly's killer, Veronica works for her dad who is a private investigator. This leads to the mystery of the week, this is what gave the show its comparisons to The X-Files and Buffy the Vampire Slayer except all the monsters in Neptune are real people. Some of the better side stories include Veronica thwarting a group of computer nerd who extort money through the internet (The Wrath of Con), she hunts down the person who is posting fake purity tests of other students including herself (Live a Virgin), she tries to catch the students who set her up for making fake ID's (Clash of the Tritons), she find a student accused of making bomb threats (Weapons of Class Destruction), and she tries to keep a student from posting an explicit video of his ex-girlfriend on the internet (M.A.D.).    Along with the great storylines, the show is also has a great cast. Kristen Bell shines as Veronica, who can hit each smart-alic line with ease but can also nail all the emotional scenes that Sarah Michelle Gellar couldn't quite hit as Buffy. And where Jennifer Garner always comes off as slutty in her many undercover costumes, Bell pulls off all her costumes with a cute as button touch to them. Supporting Bell are Enrico Colantoni, best known as the balding photographer on Just Shoot Me, as papaMars and a bunch of young actors in the first major roles. Percy Daggs III as Wallace and Francis Capra as Weevil do the best with their roles but I don't think Teddy Dunn pulled off the complexity of Duncan Kane as the season wore on.    The show was sprinkled with the multitude of familiar faces with Alyson Hannigan (Buffy), Joey Lauren Adams (Mallrats), Anthony Anderson (Barbershop), Lisa Rinna (Melrose Place), Paula Marshall (Cupid), Paris Hilton (One Night in Paris), and a double shot of the Home Improvement Boys Zachary Ty Bryan and Jonathan Taylor Tomas all making a cameo or two. Other stars making recurring appearances included Harry Hamlin (L.A. Law) as a movie star/abusive father, Amanda Seyfried (Mean Girls) as the most popular girl in school turned murder victim Lilly Kane, and being rescued from the crap that was Napoleon Dynamite was Tina Majorino who played Mac, the computer whiz who helped Veronica on all her digital cases.    Unlike other big shows of this season (*couch* Lost *cough*), Veronica Mars answered all the big questions posed this season: who raped Veronica, where did Veronica mom go, and most importantly, not to mention most shocking, who killed Lilly Kane. Although there are some important questions that will be answered next season like who was Veronica glad to see (my guess - Wallace) and what did Weevil and his boys do to Logan (my guess - he ends up next to his dad). And a question that may not be answered quickly, is Lynn Echolls really dead.
B0009AM5JK|4.0|I was a huge fan of Gorillaz when they released their first CD.  The catchy beats and trippy lyrics were stuck in my head for months, but then, they were gone.  Now, time has passed, and Gorillaz are back, and they don't dissapoint.<br />Intro - 5/10:  Very odd, a very good introduction to a very strange and enjoyable CD, but it's not really a song.<br />Last Living souls - 7/10:  Pretty good beat, with an enjoyable section near the end by 2-D.<br />Kids with guns - 7/10:  This one is sung very much like Last living souls, pretty good.<br />O-green world - 8/10:  One of the better sounding songs on the CD, intense vocals by 2-D.<br />Dirt harry - 9/10: One of my favorites.  A very cool beat with the voices of 2-D and what sounds like a child choir.<br />Feel Good inc. - 10/10: Easily the catchiest song on the CD, probably why this is the CD's chosen single.  Murdoc plays an amazing beat on his guitar in this one.<br />El manana - 10/10: Another one of my favorites.  This one sounds very deep and emotional, and is good to listen too when you are alone.<br />Every Planet we reach is dead - 7/10: You will haft to listen to this one a few times before you start to like it.  The lyrics are very catchy and has a very strange/enjoyable beat.<br />November has come - 8/10: this one is good.  A very good rap and a chorus by 2-D sounds very soothing.<br />All alone - 8/10: Another rap song.  The rap sounds pretty cool, but the vocals by the lady near the end are a little over the top.<br />White light - 3/10: this one is just scary to listen too, nuff said.<br />Dare - 6/10:  okay song, some of the singing is done by a wierd womenly voice, which doesn't sound so great.<br />Fire comming out of a monkeys head - 7/10: More of a story then a song, it still does sound pretty good when the narrator stops talking and 2-D sings his verses.<br />Don't get lost in Heaven - 5/10: Not my favorite, sounds wierd, but not in a good way.<br />Demon days - 7/10: Another wierd one, allot likethe intro.  This just doesnt sound like a real song, but it's still interesting.
B0000DD7LC|4.0|the diary of alicia is a wonderful album! and everybody who says, that alicia just plays the \\"stupid\\" piano, doesn't know what he's talking about! for the most part she's writing, playing, singing, recording and mixing the songs by herself!! a real artist!

0060763280|1.0|Please don't buy this book!  Save your money for better ones such as David Bach's series of books on achieving financial wealth and stability.  Right from the start it looked as though the book was just a lead-up and sales pitch for his seminars which go for thousands of dollars and my suspicions were confirmed.  This book could have been summarized in less than a chapter but Eker dragged it on into a full book.  It is now clear to me how he made his millions - by charging an arm and a leg on hot air versus substance.  I was very disappointed because at the end of it there were no clear instructions or strategies on how to improve my finances, just promises that the real information and life-changing material would be disclosed at his seminars.  He quoted a lot of sayings (most of which were his own) that were more like cliches than sound financial advice.  I regret wasting my time and money on this book.  I've never written a review for a book but felt compelled to because I didn't want anyone else to waste their time or money on such tripe.
B0007Y4TVU|3.0|I was really looking forward to buying this album when i heard that it had come out, so i purchased it and listened to it in my car and was very disapointed.  There are only a handful of good songs on the album.  The only one's worth listening to are B.Y.O.B., Question!, Radio/Video, and Revenga.  The others are just ok, they sound like all of the other System of a Down filler songs on their other albums.  S.O.A.D can blow you away if they really try on a few songs but can really disapoint as well with others.  I wouldn't recommend you buy this album unless you see it on sale for under $10.  It really isn't worth anymore than that especially since it's not even 40 minutes in length. i was able to finish the cd before i even got home from the mall.  I just hope SOAD's new album coming out later this year packs more of a punch.
B00005QZ7U|5.0|This movie is a masterpiece of cinematography and technical skill. This movie makes love, truth beauty and freedom come alive and jump off the screen into the heart. <br /> <br />I especially love Ewan McGregor as Christian and that Duke character is played perfectly. He's just horrible. But love wins out in the end when Satine reclaims Christian's heart.

B00005UW7V|5.0|This is wonderful film fully worthy of anything Disney ever produced. It is original. The special effects are believable. It drags your emotions all over the map.  I think people pan it because the poignancy of some of some scenes is just too hard to take if you don't shut down. Years after seeing it, images from the film float up into my consciousness. It is a hauntingly beautiful film.
B00005J9M1|5.0|These Pet Shop Boys \\"Further Listening\\" titles have been very deluxe.  However, VERY is so very amazing.  If the last track on disc two live from Rio, the cover of \\"Girls & Boys\\" doesn't have you on the edge of dancing like a maniac, then you must have no rhythm or are tied down.  I can't even recall the name of the original twink band that did that song - but the PSB's really rock it.  I saw them live 2 years ago and they blew me away.  GENIUS GENIUS GENIUS.  So VERY amazing.
B000929AJQ|4.0|With Teeth is Trent Reznor's most new wave album since Pretty Hate Machine. I love new wave, so I'm happy. Fans of his heavier guitar-based work might not be - while there's still plenty of guitar on the album, it's rarely the focus of the songs, with synth and drums forming the spine of the music. (Well hey, Dave Grohl is drumming.) Also, there's no real all-out rockers here - it's mostly midtempo stuff. <br /> <br />But that said, the songwriting is very good and you can make it to track twelve before the filler surfaces. The album doesn't end well, but overall it's a great return to form.
B0007GADZO|3.0|Steve Vai is beginning to remind me of Uri Roth and even Paul Gilbert, where following awesome start up careers they decided to go into completely contrasting sounds and compositions.  Classic Vai is the showman guitar player that made him famous, and to be frank, if this was the first album that Vai had ever released, he wouldn't of made it.

B00003CX5P|5.0|The very First film in the saga. We get to see Obi Wan's master Qui Gon Jinn teach his young padawan and little Anakin Skywalker. And the ultimate Villain of the film is Darth Maul weilding a double bladed lightsaber. A gret film if you are a fan of the Star Wars films. See it today! <br /> <br />Rated PG For Sci-Fi Action and Violence. <br /> <br />
B00000BKDZ|5.0|The best album Maiden ever,although many others will give this honor to PowerSlave, which is almost as good as seventh, but seventh introduces new sounds without becoming symphonic rock, giving the right balance of rock and mistic
B00063MBU8|1.0|Oh lord. Simple Plan. And this is one of the reasons why punk rock music is dead. It's people like Simple Plan and Good Charlotte calling themselves punk rock. So teen america today is brainwashed into thinking, \\"yes...that is punk rock.\\" They are a boy band. They are just...a more advanced boy band. They can acually play insterments. I mean they are all pretty boys...like in a boy band...and they sing about beening heartbroken...like in boy bands. They just dress differently to appeal to a new group of teenagers. But hey, I guess the people that want to like this stuff..they like it. I'm not gonna say what you can and can't like. Just trying to expose the truth.
B0000584V3|5.0|The biggest thing this cd has going for it is the atmosphere. However, the musicality and complexity and therefore the overall lasting value is markedly inferior to My Arms Your Hearse, Deliverance, and most of all Still Life. <br />This will probably not concern the newcomer, as all of Opeths albums are quality, and as Opeth's most \\"accessible\\" work, this is probably the best cd to buy for someone who's never heard of the band. I urge you however, to listen to their other cds over a period of time and come to your own conclusion over which are better.
6305949980|5.0|This is an all time great movie. I Love love love this movie and I think everyone should atleast see it once. Tim Burton is a genius. He makes things have emotions that you would never think of giving emotions to.
B0007Y08IS|1.0|Body humor aside, this move bends over backward to be completely inoffensive.  No one that could possible bite back was maligned.  Do not confuse this with satire -- it is an act of utter weakness.  Sure, they make fun of Kim Jung-Il, perhaps in a distant way, patriotic beer commercials.  There are ethnic stereotypes that were last used when Jerry Lewis was young, and some slipping actors that are grateful to have their names mentioned on screen.  In addition, if you're an ESPN watcher you might enjoy the music.  In a sub-conscious way, it panders to our impatient and annalistic tendencies (if you don't get that, then you're one of the ones I'm talking about.  Translation: I'm tired of all of this, let's just blow it all up).  What a toothless sellout.  The fact that there are well over 250 reviews should tip you off that the producer has hired some poor schelepp to sit with a stack of AOL disks to write counter reviews to keep the rating levels up.  Read a few and I think you'll begin to see the pattern.
0446677450|5.0|I believe that this book is a great read for anyone looking to get some background and some ideas about personal finance.  As a young \\"professional\\" I have worried about falling into the rat race but until I read this book I never knew how to avoid it.  I grew up in an educated family with the typical goals as presented in the book, get good grades, get a good job, work forever.  Now I can start thinking about things in terms of the income sheet vs. balance statement and making money work for me instead of working for money. <br /> <br />The ideas presented in this book make sense and I appreciate the fact that he gives hope to those of use that aren't starting out with a large inheritance.  But, at the same time, he reiterates the point throughout that not everyone has the ability or the will to put in the effort necessary to get out of the rat race.  This book has inspired me to read more and especially LEARN more about personal finances, real estate, and investing.
B000929AJQ|5.0|Every time a new Nine Inch Nails album comes out, a huge sect of Trent Reznor fans change their minds about how much they like his music.  Something I've always liked about Trent Reznor is his integrity, never sacrificing his own artistic opinion in order to please his critical and demanding fans.  With Teeth is not what I was expecting, and that's probably the best thing about it. <br />Listening to the first track, 'All The Love In The World,' which is minimalist and somewhat repetitive, a fan could be quick to criticize Trent's entire body of work.  But after hearing Reznor scream at himself in agonizingly personal songs like 'You Know What You Are' and listening to the reznoresk message in 'The Hand That Feeds,' With Teeth forced itself onto my favorites list. <br />Reznor changes his style with each album not necessarily for the better, but certainly not for the worse.  The absence of the lyric booklet in the case might bug you like it did me, but listen to what he has to say before you toss Nine Inch Nails completely. <br />It's a good album, more fragile than The Fragile, I think.
B000002J03|3.0|Whole lotta love is a direct ripoff of an old Muddy Waters tune. The only difference in the song is Led Zep added the three words whole lotta love. The rest of the song is identical! I was told they had to pay off after the fact! <br /> <br />Sad to say, but after studying the blues for a few years, I have found almost all my favorite tunes from \\"back in the day\\" were ripped from old blues guys!
B00008IAMD|5.0|It's hard to nail down these pronouncements when compared against the amazing AMERICAN RECORDINGS that began Cash's final recordings with Rick Rubin. But there's really only one song I don't much like here and the ones in between are so imbued with personal meaning to Cash. You listen to \\"Give my Love to Rose\\" and \\"Hurt\\" and imagine that he can see he'd lose his longtime wife June Carter Cash that year. After those songs of grief, he reminisces with \\"First Time Ever I Saw Your Face\\".<br /><br />With \\"In my Life\\" and \\"Bridge over Troubled Water\\", Johnny himself says goodbye...preparing those closest to him seemingly for his own passage into eternity.<br /><br />Always the strong believer in Jesus, he also takes this disc to present his most impassioned call to those \\"outside the fold\\" with the Revelations imagery in \\"The Man Comes Around\\" and more subtly in the way he throws a gospel subtext to Don Henley's \\"Desperado\\".<br /><br />For these reasons, I feel that this is the single best disc of the American quartet.<br /><br />HIGHLIGHTS:<br />If there's ever been a creepier rendering of Revelations than \\"The Man Comes Around\\", I don't think my heart could handle it. Johnny's voice crackles from the great beyond thanks to Rubin's production of the Bible verses that bookend the apocalpytic start to the album. If there was any justice, THAT song would have been the Dove award winner for Song of the Year in 2002. Cash takes his own past experience as a junkie and maybe even a sense of his wife's impending death into a cover of Trent Reznor's \\"Hurt\\" that shames Nine Inch Nails for sheer power. Couple it with one of the most well-conceived videos ever (included on the bonus DVD) and you're completely haunted. \\"Sam Hall\\" may be the only break Johnny gives us from the nearly crushing emotion here. The \\"d**n your eyes!\\" refrain is a great respite from the wrenching pain before Johnny takes us back into despair again with Nick Cave's duet assist for Hank Williams, Senior's \\"I'm So Lonesome I Could Cry\\". It all ends on a wonderfully warm hopeful note with \\"We'll Meet Again\\".<br /><br />LOWS:<br />The only note that tarnishes this disc a bit is Johnny's \\"Tear Stained Letter\\". It's just not up to the level of the other songs we hear here.<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE:<br />Johnny's final word to his world is found here.

0767817478|4.0|This movie's biggest problem is its title.  I can't imagine how much money it took for Toho to permit American filmmakers to completely reinvent Godzilla in such an appalling way.  As a Godzilla purist, I have to say that the monster in this film is a CGI imposter who has little if nothing to do with the real thing.  Godzilla does not have remarkably svelte, feminine legs and he most certainly does not lay eggs - even the son of Godzilla was adopted.  I was willing to play along with Toho in 1985 and pretend that all of the Godzilla sequels up to that point never really existed, but I'm not going to accept this Americanized monster as Godzilla.  It would have been much better (and probably much cheaper) just to call this thing Reptilosaurus or Freakin' Huge Monster or The Monster That Ate New York - anything but Godzilla.<br /><br />All my Godzilla issues aside, this really isn't that bad of a movie.  This was intended to be a \\"popcorn\\" movie, a summer action blockbuster that sought merely to entertain - and I did find it entertaining.  Heck, I even liked the French guy, and that almost never happens.  Of course, it was the French who got New York into this mess with their atomic tests, but here they actually recognize that a problem exists and do something to rectify the situation - that, even more than the CGI Godzilla's wake of destruction - is how you know this is  pure fiction.  Matthew Broderick carries the film pretty well as \\"the worm guy,\\" and that Maria Pitillo is just cute as a button.  Harry Shearer's rather needless role as the smarmy local news anchor is interesting only because of the Simpsons connection (apparently, his real voice is that of Principal Skinner).  Hank Azaria, who can be annoying at times, adds some great comedy to the film, which prevents him from being completely overshadowed by the mysterious French agent Philippe (Jean Reno).<br /><br />There's plenty of action - there's no denying that fact.  What Godzilla doesn't tear up himself, the military destroys in the process of trying to kill the world's biggest illegal alien.  Bombs, explosions, tanks, rifles, missiles by land, sea, and air - they're all here in droves.  Then, of course you have the whole siege of Madison Square Garden by untold numbers of baby monsters.  And then, just when you think the credits are about to roll, the biggest chase scene of the whole movie takes place.  None of it is remotely plausible, but it's not supposed to be.  For some, such as me, the film is ultimately rather sad.  Here's this monster created by radiation, and all he wants is to raise a family - and then he has to watch his whole world fall apart and ultimately fail.<br /><br />There is a bit of the oddball in this film.  I am still trying to figure what the heck the deal was with the Siskert and Ebert parody (Mayor Ebert and his assistant Gene).  Where in the world did this come from?  Did someone actually think this would be funny?  It's really just extremely silly, and it does the film no good whatsoever.  You can also add some really stupid lines of dialogue to the movie's faults -New Yorkers arguing over driving directions while the monster is breathing down their tail, the \\"That's a lot of fish\\" throwaway line, etc.  The movie is also pretty long - many will find it too long, but I rarely mind getting extra minutes for my money.  Ultimately, though, this film relies far too much on special effects; give me the guy in the big rubber suit any old day.  Notwithstanding this, however, the film does what it sets out to do, and it succeeds rather well at meeting its less than lofty goals; first and foremost, this is, after all, nothing more than a \\"popcorn\\" movie.himself, the military destroys in the process of trying to kill the world's biggest illegal alien.

B000062X9B|4.0|AMERICAN RECORDINGS began Cash's collaboration with Rick Rubin and stripped him back to just his voice and guitar to critical acclaim. On UNCHAINED, Cash let his voice loose over the raging rockabilly sound of Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers. For AMERICAN III: SOLITARY MAN, it's a compromise between the two approaches...there's still a band but it's more understated than the \\"Rusty Cage\\" of the 2nd American album.<br /><br />The problem on this one is that ultimately the songs are a bit weaker overall and they don't hang together as well as a whole. Don't get me wrong...there are many many great reviews for this disc and it's far above the average CD. But in Cash's oeuvre and compared against the other American releases, it doesn't stand as tall and I'd say it has to be considered the weakest of the 4 American discs.<br /><br />Probably the biggest miss for this collection is that it doesn't feature a showstopper gospel tune. Johnny has an affinity for that material and its lack is noticeable here. \\"Wayfaring Stranger\\" is good but it's not the equal of the gospel songs on the releases before and after (\\"Down there by the Train\\",\\"Redemption\\",\\"Unchained\\",\\"The Man Comes Around\\"). Also, there are more songs here that I think of as good rather than great (\\"Country Trash\\",\\"Mary of the Wild Moor\\",\\"I'm Leavin' Now\\") and that lowers my estimation of the disc.<br /><br />HIGHLIGHTS:<br /><br />On the last disc, Cash covered Petty's \\"Southern Accents\\" and I remember thinking at the time that he did fine with it, but that Petty's \\"I Won't Back Down\\" was better suited to Johnny's mythos. That's remedied here as Johnny brings a bare-knuckle vocal to the survivor's anthem. Petty supplies harmony on his own tune. \\"That Lucky Old Sun\\" was a daring inclusion, since it would have to be compared to previous renditions by legends Ray Charles and Louis Armstrong. While Johnny can't be said to better them, it stands alongside and that's saying something. Nick Cave's \\"Mercy Seat\\" is an electric chair elegy that seems as though it were written for Cash all along.

0385504209|1.0|This extraordinarily successful book is certainly not all that its surrounding hype makes it out to be. To be honest, the fiction is very decent. If you're looking for religious entertainment, all of the ingredients are there. The only problem is, when one wakes up in the real world, after being entertained in fantasy land, one certainly is not going to be able to take anything read in that land seriously.<br /><br />Some fiction books are of a nature so that you can read them, be satisfied, and be done with them. This book is of a slightly different nature. If you decide to read this, you will soon find that the author believes himself to be incorporating a substantial amount of \\"facts\\" in the fiction that he is writing. This, of course, can lead one to believe that many of the so-called \\"facts\\" are true; in the book used as a part of a fictional story. As paranoid as this may sound, this can truly lead the reader to accept the \\"facts\\" in the fiction as what the author claims them to be: \\"facts.\\"<br /><br />With that said (and please forgive me for including so many quotation marks), I would have probably given this book 4-stars for fiction and entertainment. However, for my loyalty to mystical Christianity, and my respect for the Catholic Church (of which all dignity is stripped in this book, and grossly misrepresented), I must give this a mere one star, and would rate lower if it were possible.<br /><br />These two books are the main \\"factional\\" sources for Dan Brown in The Da Vinci Code: *Holy Blood, Holy Grail by Michael Baigent, Richard Leigh, Henry Lincoln* and *The Templar Revelation: Secret Guardians of the True Identity of Christ by Lynn Picknett, Clive Prince*.<br /><br />Also, as a complement to The Da Vinci Code, I would respectfully suggest this excellent book written by Catholics: *The Da Vinci Hoax: Exposing the Errors in the Da Vinci Code by Carl E. Olson, Sandra Miesel*.
B000035P7X|3.0|I've been sitting here reading many of the reviews for this DVD.  I didn't want to submit my own until I had read them all, because I didn't want to rehash any of the criticisms already covered by others.  Well, I have no desire to sit here and read all 70 of them, so, here goes... <br /> <br />I liked this movie.  I didn't LOVE this movie, but I did like it.  Of course, I didn't have any preconceived ideas about what it should be, so that helped a lot.  As a movie, I liked the way it was filmed.  Pennebaker did a great job of intimately capturing what was happening during Dylan's 1965 tour of England.  He certainly got an accurate portrayal of the many moods of Bob Dylan, warts and all.  But the sound is awful.  There are many parts in this film where I can't understand the dialogue at all.  Subtitles would have been great.  And that's about all I have to say about the technical quality of the DVD. <br /> <br />About twenty years ago was the one and only time I've seen Dylan in concert.  It was one of those \\"Be the 23rd caller...\\" type of deals, where I won front row tickets to the show from a radio station.  It was a great show.  So, obviously I'm a fan of the man's music.  But Dylan as a person, frankly, really gets under my skin, particularly in this film. <br /> <br />First off, I'm so sick of hearing Dylan say that he's not a folk singer, and shouldn't be called one.  He's been saying it his whole career.  If he didn't want to be labeled a folk singer, he should've stayed out of the coffee houses in Greenwich Village back in the early 60s.  Because, guess what?  Folk singers performed in those coffee houses in Greenwich Village back in the early 60s.  Sounding a lot like Woody Guthrie also was a good clue for many of the people that labeled him a folk singer. <br /> <br />And since I'm already in a funk, let's talk about his overt rudeness with the media.  Dylan sure spent a lot of time giving his fans and the media a hard time in this movie.  What was that all about?  One reviewer said that Dylan was too young, and wasn't prepared for all the crazy stuff that goes along with fame.  Groupies, sycophants, and an intrusive media are all part of fame's package deal, I'm afraid.  There's no reason Dylan shouldn't have been hip to this.  After all, Beatlemania was already in full swing when this movie was filmed.  It sounds to me like Dylan wanted to have his cake and eat it too.  I think Dylan used this dislike of the public as an excuse to be rude to everyone around him. <br /> <br />If you're just a casual fan of some of Dylan's music, you probably won't get much out of this film.  It was done too early in his career to include many of his bigger hits.  But if you're a die-hard fan, it'll probably be worth the price.  But remember, I warned you, the sound quality is horrible.  Admittedly, I didn't view this on a state-of-the-art Dolby surround-sound system, but I've got a feeling it wouldn't have helped much.  Some of the musical performances don't sound too bad, but most of the dialogue sounds like it was recorded on one of those old 40-pound cassette tape recorders with a built in microphone the size of a pencil eraser. <br />
B0001NBMBC|1.0|This is by far the worst CD Slipnkot has ever came up with! The vocalists voice \\"Corey Taylor\\" doesnt even use his screaming voice. I guess all the screaming he's done in the past has ruined his voice box. In this CD you can tell that the band has grown up now that most of them are married and have kids, and they dont sound the same. They're starting to remind me of Metallica how in the 80's they were good but now they're aren't half as good as they used to be. I guess this happens to the best of bands. This CD isnt even as heavy as the other ones and it actually has 2 love songs! OMG!!! (Vermillion and Vermillion part 2). After listening to this CD I'd have to say that they shouldn't be part of the metal genre of music. Their other CDs were metalish with a good taste of rap (in \\"Spit it Out\\") but it's just not the same. For you new maggots who want to get into Slipknot then buy their 2 older CDs \\"Iowa\\" and \\"Slipknot S/T\\". For you current maggots who are willing to hear something new then try \\"Slipknot Digi Pack\\" its the first CD with 6 bonus songs. Since I absolutly despise this CD I'm not even going to give a rating for each song!
B000002LK1|5.0|What can I say about this album that has not been said by previous Depeche Mode fans.  I've played this album for various non-Depeche fans and they have fallen in love.  I have loved all their albums including the very first when their sound was not dark romantic Goth but very poppy.  This album is simply put a brilliant masterpiece - romantic, dark and lyrically seductive.  This album can be compared to other masterpieces one should have in their cd collections:  U2's \\"Joshua Tree\\", The Smiths \\"Queen is Dead\\", The Cure \\"Disintegration\\"...I think you get the picture.  Dave's singing is superb and he really is one of the best singers in the business.  Martin's songwriting is at it's best.  Do yourself a favor and listen to this cd in the dark at top volume.
B000099T2L|5.0|BEYONCE IS FINE AZZ HELL!! HER CD IS BANGING WITH INCREDIBLE VOCALS,FUNKY BEATS, AND BEAUTIFUL BALLADS!! THIS CD IS AMAZING FOR A DEBUT AND ONE OF THE BEST EVER!! DO YA THANG B!
B00005BL2A|5.0|I really do not know why so many Depeche Mode fans do not like this album.  Yes, it is not \\"Violator\\" and no band not even our beloved Depeche Mode could duplicate their masterpiece recording. This album is a more mature yet still delightfully creative piece of art. Dave's singing is mature and the songwriting is still dark yet very romantic. This album at least lyrically and mood wise, feels much more personal and autobiographical.  The reason I love Depeche Mode is their music has always grown and matured in different directions as the years pass.  Each album has been musically and lyrically creative and special in it's own way.  I believe Depeche Mode will be someday recognized along with Madonna in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.  Both are musical mavericks with the ability to reinvent themselves musically. The guys have come a long way from their first album.
B0007GAERG|2.0|Mariah Carey's whole success was based on the fact that she had good producers, promoters, and writers.  If u are true musician u would know that Mariah Carey can't sing!!! Many people may wow at the so-called \\"high notes\\", but yelling does not sound good.  I don't see why she is the best selling female artist. She can't dance(no rhythm), she's constantly hitting these high pitched SCREAMING notes, and she looks good (BUT CRAZY).  Beyonce runs rings around Mariah! Beyonce is not just good looking but fine azz h#LL!!! She can sang and dance, plus act. Look at \\"GLITTER\\"! what a flop by Mariah! Then when Mariah's album comes out everyone is putting her on a mountain top and virtually worshipping her and for what reason? Faith Evans, Blu Cantrell, Lil' Mo, Coko, Tamia, Kelly Price, Brandy.... all run rings around Mariah when it comes to singing. I give this CD 2 stars, even though the writing is good and the production is good, she CAN'T SING and is highly overrated!!!
0790729644|4.0|Let me begin by saying that I enjoy Clint Eastwood movies.  It has been my observation that he doesn't make a bad movie.  I also appreciate his talent as a director; \\"Mystic River\\" is a masterpiece example of his skills in my opinion.  However, I have been puzzled by all of the accolades for \\"The Unforgiven\\".  For me it was actually a disappointment to watch after all of the advance praise I had heard.  It IS a good movie but I'm sure I would have enjoyed it more if I had seen the movie before any of it's reviews. <br /> <br />The basic story is that of some prostitutes that want revenge on a man who disfigured one of their co-workers.  The town's tough sheriff (played excellently by Gene Hackman) isn't going to do anything about it so the girls offer a reward for someone who will.  A young wannabe gunfighter convinces Clint Eastwood's character to come along and cash in on the bounty.  Along the way they pick up Eastwood's old pal played by Morgan Freeman.  The movie basicly ambles on from there to the ending. <br /> <br /> There is a lot of good acting and the movie does its' best to dispel the myths of the Old West by the many characters and incidents involved.  I guess that was the purpose of the movie but in the process of doing so, it seemed to want to displace excitement with boredom.  As a result, it slowed down the movie quite a bit without offering much in drama to replace the action.  Some might say I'm missing the point but I think of \\"Bridge on the River Kwai\\" as an example of an outstanding anti-war movie that still appealed to many for all the military action and drama that it offered.  Eastwood's character goes through the movie looking like he's overdosed on Valium.  His climatic finish seems only to have been accomplished by a change of depressants.   <br /> <br />I said that this is a good movie and I did find a lot to enjoy.  For me the best scenes were those involving Gene Hackman.  His was the strong presence that good Westerns are noted for.Although he came across as the bad guy, his role made this movie as good as it got.   <br /> <br />I watched the Oscar ceremonies for 1992 and I cheered for Clint Eastwood to win the Best Actor award.  I was sorry that he didn't because it seemed like this might have been his last chance for the prize.  However, I knew that I was cheering for the actor and not for the role.  I think that the praise for \\"The Unforgiven\\" was largely for the man and not the movie.  Watch it and see for yourself.
B000000OAL|5.0|queen's first album was nothing short of brilliant. in 'my fairy king,' you hear the beginnings of a queen trade mark, freddie's piano style he would become famous for, and brian may's 'keep your self alive,' was the beginning of brian mays guitar styled rockers. also if your a metal fan give a listen to freddie's 'great king rat,' you hear where metal bands of the next generation get some of their ideas from, like iron maiden, freddie's 'liar,' is another classic metal track. i think queen should get more credit for their influence in hard rock and metal, everyone knows about their rock influence, but they also had a huge influence on heavy metal.
0316776963|5.0|Sedaris makes me laugh out loud with stories you have to share with anyone who will listen.  I've read all of his books (except Hercules) and this one and Naked are hilarious!
B000000OAA|5.0|one of their best albums, alot of diveristy on this album, one of their best.
B0001YRVN4|5.0|I am a really big star wars fan, and I think that the changes to the movies made them, if not better, at least just as good. The only part that I didn't like was gretto shooting first. I mean Han looked a lot better when he snuck out the blaster and shot him. I think it really decreases from his character. Other than that I loved it
B000000OAC|5.0|this is queen in the middle of their prime, you really can't go wrong with any 70's queen, and this one is among their best. my favs are 'it's late,' and 'spread your wings,' theirs no weak songs here.
B00005JNBQ|2.0|Everybody at my school was absolutely in love with Napoleon Dynamite so I figured I'd watch it, first I watched it with my friend who loved the movie and I simply stared at it but laughed along with my friend (total act but she's my bff so I told her I liked it...then I was honest about it and told her I hated it and she said that she hated it to and only watched it because I said that I liked it) but fell asleep (wonder why?) so I didn't get to see it all, then I watched it with my friend who had never seen the movie before and I saw the whole thing and I must say that it is one of the most boring and plotless/pointless movies I have ever seen. I really don't understand how everybody finds it so funny and enjoyable. I liked a few parts/lines but that's about it. I think parts suck and I think some parts...were okay (just barely) but over all it was definitely a so so movie. But the guy who plays Napoleon (Jon Heder) is very cute without all his Napoleon gear on which is a plus but overall, if you want to see this movie, I say rent--actually no, don't even waste the three bucks rental fee...just wait til it comes out on TV...but don't say I didn't warn you...ND sucks...I'm still shocked at how it won Best Movie of the Year, Best Dance Number, and Breakout Male Performance...shocking really.
B000000OAH|5.0|why is this album so underated? i think mabe it has one song  i don't like, ' more of that jazz,' the rest is great. 'jazz' isn't as consistent as their first six albums, mabe that's why it wasn't recieved well by rock fans, but it has gems all over the place, don't stop me now, fat bottomed girls are both classics, also dreamer's ball, let me entertain you, dead on time are all solids tracks.
B00005JLCI|5.0|Hats off to Kenneth Branagh for a movie that brings new life and vivid images to a Shakespeare classic without ruining the original intent of the bard's play. Forget long overly-dramatic soliloquies that, while brilliant, can put you to sleep. Now the clever lines are delivered with witt and passion in a real and alive setting. The acting is superb. Kate Winslet is a gorgeous and believable Ophelia, refusing to play the role as an indifferent ninny but rather with a pitiable sensuality. Kenneth Branagh perfectly portrays the role of disturbed Hamlet. His excellent understanding of the complex character shines through every line he delivers.In addition, we get lavish sets, ornate costumes, a star-studded cast, and a sword-clashing, heart-pounding, tear-jerking finale. Don't miss this movie! Sure, it takes a little more effort to get through the fancy dialogue, but its WELL WORTH THE EFFORT!
B0007N1AI6|3.0|priest returns with a pretty good album, not great by any means, but still pretty good. good music, some silly lyrics. my favs are 'judas rising' and 'demonzier' i also like 'angel'. my least favs are wheels of fire and the last two tracks, also deal with the devil and revolution are pretty average songs. for 50 year old rockers, it's not bad, much better than the horrible 'ripper' albums, and about on the same level as painkiller, mabe slightly weaker.
B00080ZG10|1.0|Now we KNOW why Martin Scorsese did not win the Oscar AGAIN for Best Director.  Why?  Because \\"The Aviator\\"  SUCKS!!!  The movie is filled with cliches and formulatic crap.  Do not waste your money or your time.  Marty-you need to RETIRE...
B0000630BT|3.0|this is not priest's best, it's a pretty good album, to many bad songs to be their best like leather rebel, and metal meltdown, but the title track is probably their best song.
0440238609|3.0|So this is the \\"His Dark Materials\\" trilogy by Phillip Pullman.  I almost didn't hear about it at all, I admit, but eventually, someone mentioned the first book to me, and I decided to give it a look, and after the first book, well...  I couldn't just leave it at that.  The story of each book is not complete by itself.  It's not enough unless you've read all three.  It's like the Lord of the Rings, in that respect. <br />Well, now having finished all three books, let me give them an honest, frank evaluation, and if it sometimes sounds like I'm griping, please remember that I've only just finished reading them as I write this, and the feelings of the main characters are still fresh in my mind. <br />Pullman's much-appreciated trilogy leaves several general impressions on my mind.  It predates many of the things it has similarities to, but on the whole, it left a flavor in my mind that is part Lovecraft, part Anne Rice, part Kingdom Hearts, part Digimon the TV Show Season 1, yet with other flavors as well that I can't quite place.  All I know is that it's not part Shakespeare. <br />Using his phenomenal writing style and ability at conveying intense and powerful emotions through the written word, Pullman has sculpted, as the title of the trilogy suggests, a sort of dark mythology/grim multiverse, in which, like Lovecraft, existence as we know it only survives by being sealed inside a virtual bubble, to protect it from the all-encompassing dark forces that extend into eternity beyond.  In addition, Pullman's mythology paints God, all gods and all angels as being foolish and idiotic to as great a degree as man, if not more so.  Much the same method as used by the ancient greeks to sculpt their gods and heroes. <br />So there is a force of ultimate evil in Pullman's multiverse, so powerful as to be sickening and terrifying, and no visible force for ultimate good, since Pullman simply chose not to make one.  Even the main characters, while being basically likable people,are still fundamentally flawed in all the normal human ways.  The story revolves, really, around two characters.  Lyra, who hails from a world where everyone has a spirit that follows them around in the shape of an animal called a \\"Daemon\\" (the original english spelling for demon.)  Hers is named Pantaleimon, which even sounds like a Digimon's name.  The other main character is Will, from a world very similar to ours. <br />The premise of these countless worlds that can only be connected through the darkness is the similarity I draw between these books and Kingdom Hearts, and the \\"Specters\\" (evil spirit-like beasties) even strike me as being something like KH's \\"Heartless.\\" <br />Other than these two main characters, I really only have one character that I want to say anything about, and that's Mrs. Coulter.  She starts off as, in the first two books, the undisputed \\"bad guy\\" of the series, but is simply not terrifying in the least, and when a bad guy isn't terrifying, at least in a book, I find that they have an easy time becoming annoying.  This happened with her. <br />In this respect, the Specters are a much better evil bad guy concept.  Obviously significantly more powerful and just as malignant as Coulter herself, they ultimately fail to be the perfect bad guys for this series because Pullman simply chose not to use them that way. <br />In the end, the general mood of the story, though it's set against a heavy backdrop of evil and vile deeds, gravitates strongly away from either good OR evil, preferring instead to focus on the less-distinct areas of depressing mortal existence.  This it does with such strength and talent that I probably won't get over it for quite some time. <br />This, really, is my primary beef with His Dark Materials, just as it was with Digimon's first season, and to a lesser degree, with the Lord of the Rings. <br />You don't (or at least I don't) feel anything approaching happiness or hope when this story comes to a close, partly becausethere are still so many issues to be solved, and partly because both of the main characters are given the most dismal fate imaginable.  You see, when two people love each other, and I mean real love, not just simple attraction, they become very similar in relationship to Pullman's humans and daemons, and seperating them is most dangerous, when it's possible, because they mourn for one another so deeply that their every moment apart is painful by comparison.  Pullman seems to realize this, depicts this tragedy in great, unneccesary detail, but does nothing to correct it, or even, as with Romeo and Juliet, to carry it through to its natural conclusion.  In the end, all this eventuality really does is upset me terribly, and I don't need books to do that.  For this reason, I won't read this trilogy again, ever, but who knows?  You may find some deeper interpretation of this work that I could not.
0385474547|5.0|This book was recommended to me while I was visiting Africa. I subsequently found out that it is widely used in highschools, colleges and universitites.  I have to admit that ordering the Cliff Notes along with the book was a wise decision and you can note from my many other reviews on Amazon that I am a sophisticated reader.  THINGS FALL APART is not always easy to follow.  Reading the Cliff Notes along with the book helped me with some of the underlying meanings and also verified that I had to correct understanding of some of the situations.<br /><br />I believe that if there is one major theme in the book, its the clash of cultures. We as westerners always identify with the westerners who make first contact with people of other cultures.  As a result it hard to identify with other cultures. THINGS FALL APART gives you that chance to understand other religions and how other people life.  But it also gives you the opportunity to think about basic concepts of right and wrong.  While the book takes place in Africa, the situations can be compared to other religions and other clashes of culture.<br /><br />At first glance we think it absurd for the tribe to blindly follow the word of the oracles.  But then think of situations in other religions and other times when people blindly followed the directions of a dictator or religious leaders.  The bottom line is that there is much room for discussion in this book.<br /><br />It is unfortunate that a few students wrote reviews of this book panning it.  Apparently they did only did a superficial reading of the book.  Or possibly did not get a good background lecture from their teachers.<br /><br />This would be a great book for discussion in a book club.  It is for the serious reader.  It makes the reader reflect on his or her own life and culture and wonder what decisions you would make if faced with the same situation.  Are there basic concepts of right and wrong that go beyond the demands of culture? Did Okonkwo's failure come about as a result of his going against those basic conflicts?  Read the book and make up your own mind.<br /><br />Although this is a book about early contact between Europeans and primitive African peoples it is not about first contact.  You will note that Okonkwo, has a gun which he obviously got from a European.  That gun contributes significantly to his down fall.  A good topic for discussion is the influence of guns in the story.'s failure come about as a result of his going against those basic conflicts?

1592220053|3.0|If you are like me you just finished the last installment of a Song of fire and ice and you need some more of his writing. I picked this up hoping for a song's equivalent but this fell short. Not a terrible read though. The main character can be slightly annoying at times with his infatuation for cats but over all is strangely interesting. Worth a read but don't expect the greatness that is a song of fire and ice.
B0001NBMBC|1.0|I recently read an online interview with the inarticulate (no surprise here) Shawn Crahan, a.k.a. Clown (No.6), who said he wants to be better than KISS.  Apparently, he was commenting as to why the masks have been used in Slipknot's ridiculous 'schtick'.  I have news for you Mr. Crahan... comparing your dime-a-dozen, 'flash-in-the-pan' nu-metal, no-talent noise to classic mega-star trendsetters KISS is like comparing a Yugo to a Ferrari!  Alas, 'the dumbing down of America continues' with you 'nu-metal' mall-rat mentality losers embracing this utter mindless talent-less drivel...

B0002WYS6S|5.0|basically, if you own a guitar, own a dvd player or have any taste in music you will already have this DVD, but for those that don't here's my 5 cents.  this DVD is an amazing masterpiece of music and visuals.  its extremely easy to just listen to a music DVD but this one is a must to watch.  the insane solo's from guitarist John Petrucci just seem so simple, yet they are riduclously hard and just amazing to listen to!  every musician puts in 110% and it shows why they are one of the best bands around, and one of the rarer bands who are actually masters with their instruments.  i can't reccomend this DVD any higher, its simply an amazing performance.
B000059RL3|5.0|I do not know how to put it in words...it's just that powerful an album. <br /> <br />A timeless classic that will rank for the rest of time!!
B00006F7XJ|5.0|Off the top of my head I cannot think of another prog band from the original wave in the 70s that are still together and making albums that are BETTER than what they produced back then.  Camel simply amazes with RAJAZ, and now this. With the possible exception of Steve Hackett there is no one else from this vintage that seems to still be able to write in the \\"olden style\\" and make it sound fresh and exciting.  Hats off to Camel . . . I hope they keep making 'em if they can stay this good.  I agree with David Lusher's comments about the English ambience of NOD . . . it's pastoral and moving and wonderful. <br /> <br />BTW, the album is gold, but what's with Amazon's PRICE?!!!  $41??  Ehh, without seeming ungrateful for the forum to write this in you can certainly do better than that!  Try Camel's website . . . they'll cut you a deal. ;-)
6305132984|5.0|I am not a big fan of musicals to be honest. I find most musicals absolutely annoyingly sweet. One of the few musicals that I like is \\"West Side Story\\". I first saw this classic was in my high school english AP class.<br /><br />The storyline is pretty basic. It is basically a modern version of \\"Romeo and Juliet\\". Two people from two different families who hate each other, falls in love despite the odds. The only difference is: a) the two families are gangs and b) it is a musical. Also the issue of racism is tackled in the film because one of the gangs (the Sharks) is Puerto Rican and part of the warfare between the Sharks and the Jets is due to the Jets' dislike for Puerto Ricans. In \\"Romeo and Juliet\\", the Montagues and Capulets simply hate each other for no other reason  that they hate each other, and in the end, both gangs realizes what their hatred for each other has cost them.<br /><br />I love \\"West Side Story\\" so much is because of Leonard and Bernstein's music and the choreography. The songs are infectious and the choreography so lively. I also enjoyed performances by a young Natalie Wood, Rita Moreno, Richard Beymer, George Chaklis, and Russ Tamblin. I never get tired of watching \\"West Side Story\\". For me it is a timeless classic.
B000000W5L|5.0|Sure these guys may well be into their 60s now and are often the subjects of late night and radio jokes because of this.All rubbish aside,all you need to know is that these guys definitely earned their self proclaimed title of greatest rock and roll band in the world,at a time,and alongside bands like Zeppelin,Sabbath,and the Beatles,are probably one of the most predominant influences in rock music.Exile is what many consider their crowning acheivement,and that's exactly what it is.My fav songs on here tend to be the fast paced bluesy rockers that only The Stones could do!A certain energy seems to be behind alot of the songs on here,and for good reason.The Stones were in their youthful prime before drugs got into the picture and were in the middle of a hotstreak.If you really wanna get into The Stones,this is the album to get.It may not contain all of their radio hits but that doesn't matter since these guys were never about making radio singles.    The Stones have stood the test of time as one of the greatest bands of all time.I recommend any of their albums between '68 and '75 if you really want to get into the band.These guys influenced everyone from the old school (Aerosmith,Guns N Roses,Black Crowes,etc) to the new school (Jet,The Glitterati,etc).Buy Exile!
B00005O3VD|4.0|When Barbra Streisand hit the big screen in this expensive 1968 musical biopic of Ziegfeld star Fanny Brice, she became an instant movie legend and understandably so as master filmmaker William Wyler tailored a launching pad so accommodating to her personality and drive that it becomes apparent only later that the film itself is not terribly exceptional. The first half of the film, by far the best part, is about Brice's fast climb to stardom and her blind infatuation of gambler Nick Arnstein, played with a bit too much continental charm by an overshadowed Omar Sharif. The comparatively dramatic second half is really about the inevitable fate of their relationship. The energy that drives the first half seems to sputter in the second half, and Streisand is left to carry the whole thing to the finish line.<br /><br />The fact that the story has anything to do with Brice seems purely circumstantial in deference to Streisand's phenomenal talent especially as a first-rank comedienne and the pre-eminent song stylist of her generation. For the latter aspect alone, \\"Funny Girl\\" is essential viewing, especially for three solo numbers penned by the legendary team of Jule Styne and Bob Merrill (who co-wrote \\"Gypsy\\"). First, as a young wannabe trying to convince Mr. Keeney at the local burlesque house to hire her, Streisand sings \\"I'm the Greatest Star\\" with an appropriately persistent brassiness that suddenly turns into a dramatic clarion call picking up the percussive momentum of \\"Don't Rain on My Parade\\" until the song title truly becomes fact and not a boast. The second song is her anthem, \\"People\\", sung to an unsurprisingly awestruck Sharif on the darkened Hollywood-phony backlit set of Henry Street, first as an expression of her unrequited love for Arnstein and then more effectively as a solo plea bordering on desperation as she leans against a lamppost. The third number is made breathtaking by the ingenious way that Wyler films her performance of \\"Don't Rain on My Parade\\" as a montage of fast cuts that leads an Arnstein-chasing Brice to the amazing tugboat finish. The fact that they all occur in the first half makes the second half all the more desultory saved at the end by Streisand's memorably triumphant take on Brice's \\"My Man\\". These are all indisputably classic movie musical moments.<br /><br />The remaining numbers are good and mostly a vehicle to show off Streisand's considerable comedy skills - maneuvering roller skates on \\"I'd Rather Be Blue (Over You)\\", flouncing her dress in front of a nonplussed Ziegfeld on \\"Second Hand Rose\\", waddling around as a \\"pregnant\\" bride in the Ziegfeld extravaganza \\"His Love Makes Me Beautiful\\", accommodating Arnstein's aggressive parlor advances in \\"You Are Woman\\", and chronicling her happily married state in \\"Sadie, Sadie\\". That's not to say she is not a fine dramatic actress, just a sometimes rather theatrical one at least in her first film here, as she expresses her heartbreak in a variety of overdone hairstyles and clothes until her seeming vindication at the end. No other actress can express as dexterously the concurrent insecurity, egotism and humor that Streisand in her prime could. The other elements in this movie seem incidental, even the supporting performances which include Kay Medford's sarcastically tender turn as Brice's mother Rose and Walter Pidgeon elegantly tyrannical and savvy as Ziegfeld. This turned out to be Wyler's penultimate film, and it's not really one of his best as the humanistic values that permeate his earlier classics seem missing here in favor of mounting a star vehicle for Streisand. But the logic is understandable as a Barbra Streisand does not come along very often.  Even for those who have seen it numerous times before, the 2001 restoration contained on the DVD completely revitalizes the film.ntage of fast cuts that leads an Arnstein-chasing Brice to the amazing tugboat finish.

B00003CXCT|2.0|[...]  First, in review this film set is a disgusting hack of a classic and historical landmark in film-making.  These films have been modified from their original content without notice to the public, therefore deceiving those seeking to purchase a fond memory.  They are poor adaptations with CGI makeovers and inserts that will be undesirable to most original fans.  The film score too has been modified and mucks up a classic compilation.  For the trained ear, the cuts and inserts will be unpleasantly noticeable.    If George Lucas wants to screw up his newest trilogy series and print a lot of eye candy with a poor story, that's his business.  He knows that he will and has disappointed his original fans by great leaps and bounds.  However, it's not only a disappointment to original fans to purchase this altered ORIGINAL film series, the production itself is a crime of deception.      To elaborate, a film is a work of art, regardless of it's title and so on.  Each film piece is of course the property and vision of the artist, regardless of how good or bad it may appear to the public.  However, once a piece has been published, for those who appreciate that publication, any changes thereafter naturally provoke an emotional response and most often a negative one.  To make an analogy, would anyone who admires the \\"Mona Lisa\\" appreciate an adaptation that changed her hair style, clothing and such to meet modern day trends?  The answer is just this... For anyone who appreciates a good joke, maybe.  But for a true art collector, not a chance.  Further, to package and sell such a rework under the pretence that it is an original print would be a crime of deception.     I direct this next segment to the writer of the review titled \\"A Note From A Lucas Employee.\\"  Dear John,  your excuses about time constraints and such are as ridiculous as this product.  A majority of those purchasing this product, did so believing they were getting an original work that captured and launcheda following of epic proportions.  Several generations of fans have been crushed by these adaptations.  In your write up you explain that Lucas gave you and the rest of his crew little time to phase these pictures over to DVD.  I have to scratch my head and wonder how long it really takes to copy the films to a new media format?  I can only believe that such an effort takes about an hour or two at the most.  I can guarantee that not one fan asked for the Lucas team to recolor lightsabers or Jaba.  Not one fan asked for the Lucas team to extend the film series by inserting cheap and slopped together CGI extras.  Further, not one fan complained or said that the original film score needed modification.  Each of the adaptations are so obvious to anyone who knows this series well and they stand out like an unwanted sore thumb.  You also mention that Lucas graciously did this to please his audience with a DVD series just before DVDs are to be replaced by a newer technology.  You add that original cuts will soon be available in 2007 on the newest media.  How does one respond to this statement?  Well, my response is... What concession are you trying to offer here?  I see your speech and this product as a slap in the face and as a statement of \\"here everyone, waste your money on this product, feel ill towards it, and when the newest releases hit the street, we'll look forward to you lining our pockets with gold once more.\\"  In other words you have simply stated in bold terms... \\"SUCKERS.\\"  If I may be so bold to speak for original fans, we thank you for this load of crap!  And by the way, my sympathies to you and the Lucas team if your feeling a bit overworked.    In response to those who would bash ones who feel pain over purchasing this rather expensive product which adapts the original works and deceives expectation, I'm sure you would much rather go back to your TV set and watch a re-run of the oh-so-realistic Mighty Morphan Power Rangers.  So grab your pacifiers, insertthem appropriately, and please keep your less than educated comments to yourselves.      What many today fail to realize is that the original Star Wars was a budget film with special effects and such that were less than adequate, even for its time.  Additionally, most of the characters were portrayed by no name actors. And yet regardless, the imagination and creativity of the story and  film managed to achieve such a success, recognition and following that it will outlive its original fan base and many more to follow.  Personally, I can remember when \\"Empire Strikes Back\\" came out, it took weeks to get near the box office just to get a ticket.  Not even the Matrix or any other film I'm aware of to include the new trilogy films, has managed to pull that off.  There is a significant value to the original trilogy and that value has been diminished in this so called original release.  In my opinion, this release only adds to the disappointment felt by original fans as a result of the short minded and less than creative story compiled in the newest trilogy.      Now I have to ask this, why would anyone need to adapt original works to fit new works?  Unless, the newer works were being slopped together for a quick buck and it becomes easiest to make modifications to the originals to aid in this cheap and capitalist effort.  I take nothing away from the difficulty and efforts it must take to produce a good story.  However, if your going to do something, why not do it right from the start?  Why make a new series that doesn't link well with the original series?  Lucas had everything he and his crew needed to make the new productions into  blockbuster hits that could have been remembered throughout history just as his originals have thus far.  Yet what has been produced instead is a film series that completely defies the original story content and is so laden with inconsistencies, over-dramatics, and CGI that no matter what modifications are made to either trilogy, the seriesas a whole will never mesh.    In closing, I give the \\"ORIGINAL\\" trilogy a 5/5.  I then give this release a 2/5 as it is not the original film by any stretch of the words.  As one review writer exclaimed \\"George we want our money back!\\"  As a fan, I personally want the original movies on DVD as I had believed I was getting.      To add one more comment, I rate the newest story line with a 1/5 as it is directed at children and the weak minded who are easily drawn in by the dazzle of carnival lighting effects with little else.  Simply, the story as a whole is weak and lacks the talent of a truly creative writer and relies solely on computer generated graphics for any entertainment value.
B00000JCOV|5.0|First of all, if you are going to judge the band based on the gimmicky masks, I want to remind you of a few things.  First of all, look at the band Kiss.  They made some great music that has really stood the test of time, yet they went onstage all the time in full makeup.  Secondly, what the band looks like has nothing to do with the musical experience.  And lastly, because of the masks, the members of this band can live normal lives.  No one really recognizes them without the masks, hence they don't suffer the burden of public recognition when they don't want it. <br /> <br />I grew up in the late 80's/early 90's.  I grew up on and still listen to bands like Guns 'n Roses, Metallica, Megadeth, Dream Theater, Iron Maiden, Motley Crue, Ozzy, Anthrax, and Van Halen.  As far as the metal I enjoy listening to, apart from some prog metal bands you've never heard of, I always felt like Pantera was the last great metal band...that is until Slipknot showed up on the scene. <br /> <br />I would say 98% of the 'metal' that has come out since the mid-90's is crap.  Most of it really isn't even metal, and the rest is unoriginal and bland.  With Slipknot, we get nine guys from Iowa who have liquid metal pumping through their veins and a talent for writing music that is ground breaking in the metal arena, but still commercially acceptable by the general public.  They combine elements of rap, thrash, death metal, hardcore, and alternative music to make up a signature sound that sets this band apart from the rest.  They took these risks and developed a new sound that has the heavy explosiveness of bands like Pantera and Slayer, yet sells albums like the Dave Matthews Band!  A metal fan couldn't ask for more.   <br /> <br />I'm not that thrilled with the two followups to this debut album, simply because they don't develop the sound that much, but as far as this recording goes, I consider it to be one of the best metal albums of the last ten years.  I saw the band a few times when they were touring for this album, including Ozzfest and Tattoo the Earth.  The energy of the music comes alive and the band delivers an awesome concert experience.   <br /> <br />The more popular songs her are '(sic),' 'Eyeless,' 'Wait and Bleed,' and 'Spit it Out.'  Besides the sheer heaviness, I like the band because of their versatility.  All the songs on this disc sound different, and even within songs, the music takes on an almost progressive nature with all the different changes.  A great example of this is the song 'Me Inside.'  The band launches into a 'nursery-rhyme-type' vocal section reminiscent of Korn.  Then for the break in between verses, we hear turntables.  After the verse again, the vocals totally change into a strong, clear vocal that sounds more like Soundgarden, ('I wasn't promised a thing/You keep mocking me...') - and then for the line 'Before you know it/after you're gone' it sounds like Pantera.   <br /> <br />I'm not going to do a song-by-song analysis.  Just buy the album and listen for yourself.  It would be a major mistake to overlook this gem.
B0002YLC24|5.0|\\"Before Sunset\\" picks up ten years later after \\"Before Sunrise.\\"  Many of us already know these characters.  We know what's at stake between them, to a degree . . . although some of that we learn as \\"Sunset\\" takes us to its conclusion.  Whereas \\"Sunrise\\" was about impulsive young love, \\"Sunset\\" is about lost chances, remorse, and holding on to that last thread of hope.<br /><br />For all these reasons and more \\"Sunset\\" is the better film.  It's more tightly woven than the first and we know pretty early on what our number one question is - will they finally get together as a couple?  (Despite what the film's critics argue, the answer is fairly obvious in the last few seconds.)<br /><br />The film dances around the edges of intimacy at the beginning - just like it would happen in real life.  The characters chat about life, politics, career, philosophy.  Only when time ticks away and both realize what they are about to lose, once again, do they begin to turn to their inner most thoughts and desires.<br /><br />It's a bit disheartening to see the reviews of films such as \\"The Notebook\\" which are sappy, poorly acted and unrealistic compared to \\"Before Sunset\\" which so clearly shows a level of love, realism and attention to detail.<br /><br />I also have to disagree with those who have stated that this film is \\"anti-American.\\"  Poll after poll has shown that the majority of people on the planet, including the industrialized world, oppose US foreign policy.  You can dislike that fact if you want. However, it would ludicrous to suggest that a European would not be critical of the US.  Still, the French government is no better and have committed horrendous acts of their own.  So I would argue that Delphy's character, while perhaps realistic, is either naive or a bit nationalistic herself for not bashing her own government, not just the US.  But all of this is besides the point . . .<br /><br />\\"Before Sunset,\\" like it's prequel, will likely stand the test of time in the world of cinema.  It's romantic, thought provoking and ground breaking. It's one of those films like \\"Memento\\" that others will only be able to copy
B00026W82U|5.0|This is a beautiful album, nearly perfect..I agree with the other review, that you could give this album to your mom and she would love it as much as you do ( and that IS scary) I've given this cd to a handful of people, and they all love it. I also recommend their remixed cd Versus, and Erlend's solo stuff, but I think you can't go wrong with any of their albums.
0975991477|5.0|Dr. Lipton's book does an excellent job of debunking the idea that we are always victims of our genes. Instead, he brings forth information in which he suggests that we are victims of our programming, our true beliefs. Although he alludes to the idea that if you change your beliefs you can change your life, this is not a how-to book.<br /><br />This is a fine read breaking new ground. I highly recommend it.<br /><br />Ray Dodd, author, BeliefWorks and The Power of Belief
0671027344|5.0|Perks of being a wallflower is one of those books you just can't put down. The way Stephen Chbosky told the life of high school so well, all the characters were so great and amazing. I really enjoyed reading this profound novel, it really makes you think.
B000007MVM|5.0|Probably the best Syd solo album and if you're looking to get into more Syd I'd start here. Very different sound and startleingly different from Piper At The Gates of Dawn (of which Syd wrote most of the material for) which let's you know that the scope of vision this guy had was quite broad. This music probably isn't for everyone, but then again if you're a thinking person who appreciates higher forms of art then you probably already understand that most of your tastes lies outside of the mainstream. Also, I can't help but to interject one of my own observations from having listened to a lot of Syd's post Floyd work, which is that his work is highly organized and fantastically brilliant which makes me question how crazy he could have actually have been? I'm sure he was a difficult person to work with, and was very eccentric (as is evident by listening to his work) but the end results are staggering. His works aren't just some arbitrary ramblings of a crazy man by any means. Each of these songs convey a lot of feeling and a profound artistic vision. But then again you hear some of the songs and they sound like a man who's mind is cracking. You get a deep sense of isolation, loneliness, and the feelings of a very emotionally disoriented individual. Like all good art this album will challenge you to think about both the song and the arteur.

B000005IS1|5.0|This album is a must own for anyone into old rock. All of the Stooges albums, Velvet Underground albums, Brian Jones Mick Taylor era/Rolling Stones, early T.Rex (Slider and Electric Warrior), and MC5 albums are all required listening. All I can say is holy smokes does this album rock! I had the pleasure of growing up in Michigan and knowing people that got to witness this band in all of their glory. The stories they tell make me wish I was born a little earlier to have witnessed what sounded like some of the best music ever. If you read Please Kill Me and see the MC5 documentary (which has yet to be released on DVD) you will realize that few rocked this hard. I'll also say this, the MC5 Powertrip album also has some live stuff on it that will blow off the roof. I know I'm in a minority saying this but I like it better than Kick Out The Jams. The band freaks out hard on that album. They do an amazing cover of I Put A Spell on You, and they fly off the maps with the most intense freakout I've heard on the legendary 'Mad Like Eldridge Cleaver'. All I can say is this band was a one of a kind. The politics will make you laugh, the music will make you jump, and the call to arms of Kick Out the Jams will always help you get it out. After putting up with abuse at my crappy corporate office job putting this one on helps me forget about all of that crap. It's true good rock and roll will always balm the soul!
0767802470|4.0|This is a wonderful, suspenseful movie. I have not seen the original U.S. release of 140+ minutes or the 6-hour German mini-series, so I have nothing to compare it to. But as a stand-alone movie, it is excellent. The acting and special effects are superb. One can never tell those effects which were made with scale models. <br /> <br />The DVD is also a pleasure. The anamorphic transfer is beautiful, and the sound (I viewed it in English) is also superb. <br /> <br />My only complaint about the film...especially for an early-80's release....are the inclusion of some items which only appear to serve to please those who can't stand a movie without some bathroom humor somewhere along the way. Were the \\"puke in the bathroom\\", \\"crabs\\", and \\"peeing in a can\\" scenes really necessary? They took away greatly from an otherwise pleasureable movie, and contributed nothing.  <br /> <br />Sadly, this type of thing is even MORE prevalent in today's movies. Is it any wonder I usually stick to pre-1980 movies?
B000055Y0Y|2.0|Highly overrated and poorly written movie which essentially was a compilation of every cliche ever used in the thriller genre. These include the brilliant madman killer who makes taunting phone calls to the good guy cop, \\"surprise\\" plot twists, various disguises, horribly insipid dialogue, completely predictable \\"romance\\" between the older agent (Eastwood) and a much younger attractive Secret Service agent, etc... Of course the formula wouldn't be complete without some absurd plot contrivance designed to make the audience care about this drek- in this case, it is Eastwood's obsessive need to redeem himself 30 years after he botched the JFK security detail. Right. Anyway, its all been done so much better before. Rent Dirty Harry or Silence of the Lambs.
B000002LIM|3.0|This music worked perfectly within the context of the movie.  But as a stand alone listening experience, it doesn't hold up that well.  But if you enjoy orchestral movie scores, you may enjoy it more than I do.
B0007Y4TVU|1.0|Faith No More is one of the greatest bands to ever grace this worthless planet. And to compare them to System of a Down is downright preposterous and asinine. It's like comparing William Shakespeare to Dan Brown, I mean, you just can't. So do yourself a favor and buy a Faith No More CD instead, Angel Dust to be exact, and forget this one.
B000024Y9L|5.0|This rocks!<br />Futureal is a great rocker featuring the best guitar work of Iron Maiden's career!<br />Other highlights include The Clansman, The Educated Fool, &amp; Don't Look To The Eyes Of A Stranger.<br />The Angel And The Gambler and Como Estais Amigos are both pretty much average rockers.<br />When Two Worlds Collide is a all-out slam-dunk rock-fest!<br />Finally, Lightning Strikes Twice features a great build-up to chorus.<br />Sure, it dosen't sound like Maiden, but does that really matter as long as it rules!?!
B000063COX|5.0|Before Iron Maiden became mainstream, they released two albums this one and killers. With lead singer Paul Dianno Iron Maiden was one of the leading bands in The New Wave Of British Heavy Metal. At the time their punkish sound was so original, guitarists Dave Murray and Adrian Smiths spine tingleing bluesy tone mixed with metal speed was groundbreaking. Heres what I think of the songs.     1.Prowler (5/5)- one of th sweetest wah wah riffs ive ever heard  2.Sanctuary (4/5)- total punk  3.Remember Tommorow (4.5/5)- starts of with a soft eerie mood building up into a dark, evil riff  4.Running Free (3/5)- My least favorite song on the album, its just so plain  5.Phantom Of The Opera (5/5)- The dual harmonies between the guitar and bass is awesome, Steve Harris is an amazing bassist and so underated  6.Transylvania (3/5)- an okay instrumental song  7.Strange World (2.5/5)- a slow and boring song almost identical too Remember Tommorow  8.Charlot The Harlot (3/5)-a song about a hooker, okay song  9.Iron Maiden (4.5/5)- great riff, total punk    If you like Metal or hard rock check this album out, if you like punk you might also like it.    If you liked this album you might also like:  Judas Priest- Hell Bent For Leather  Def Leppard- On Through The Night  Motley Crue- Too Fast For Love
1591840562|5.0|\\"The Art Of The Start\\" is written to help guide the entrepreneur to success through secrets and techniques the author, Guy Kawasaki, has picked up as a venture capitalist.<br /><br />First of all, this book is organized nearly flawlessly.  The start of each chapter contains an overview for the chapter so you know where the book is going, while the body of chapter contains the details and is then finished with a list of frequently asked questions and their corresponding answers.<br /><br />Guy has done a good job of getting to the point quickly and clearly.  The book is filled with good advice from layouts for pitching to investors, bootstrapping techniques, and techniques for getting your business off the ground.<br /><br />I really couldn't find anything disappointing about this book.  This should be a must-read for all entrepreneurs, whether you are just thinking about starting a business or are already in the middle of one.  5 out of 5 stars.
B0007TKNL0|5.0|Excellent, well done movie.  The cast was just phenomenal and talented.   Even though I saw the Broadway show, I didn't feel connected with the characters.  The film achieved that feeling with all of the actors chosen and particularly Gerard Butler.  He was a brillant choice to play the Phantom.  He brought a very personal touch to the role and made you connect with and sympathize with the character. Congrats to all involved with this film and thanks because now I can watch it whenever I want without having to go to Broadway.
B0002OERI0|3.0|As Green Day kept getting more popular in the mainstream theyve become worse. This is there worst CD yet and the next one will be even worse. So anyways There are a couple good song on the CD like \\"St.Jimmy\\", \\"Wake Me Up When September Ends\\", \\"Shes a rebel\\", and \\"Give Me Novacane\\". All the singles \\"American Idiot\\", \\"Holiday\\", and \\"Boulevard Of Broken Dreams\\" suck. So if your gonna get any Green Day get \\"Dookie\\" or \\"Nimrod\\" or \\"Insomniac\\". Last thing, that eyeliner crap that should be a clue.
B00097DX3U|4.0|This is a good album if you look at it from the proper perspective. Let me explain: if you are a pure rage fan, no soundgarden, you will not like this album. Its slowed down, not \\"like a stone\\" slowed down which would merit 0 stars, but still mellowed. Not to say there is no rocking, but there is much less rage and a whole lot more soundgarden in this record. If you are like me and felt that soundgarden was a strong band but had issues opening up and releasing all the brilliant tension that they could build up in a song, then you will like this album. One thing the rage guys specialize in is release and they show their talents in this album. Highlights are Out of Exile, The Worm, and Doesn't Remind Me.
B0000C1733|5.0|First off im gonna say this album is prolly the best CD ive bought.Although the older RHCP stuff is better this CD is better than What Hits because the songs on this CD are actually hits.Also this CD seems to be almost all mellow songs and show that theyve matured  over the years.Here is a brief summary of every song. <br /> <br />Under The Bridge: Sort of killed by the radio 9/10 <br />Give It Away: this is basically a rap song 6/10 <br />Californication: a mellow song that has a great guitar solo 10/10 <br />Scar tissue: another mellow song that has a great guitar solo 10/10 <br />Soul To Squeeze: the best song on the cd is another mellow song 10/10 <br />otherside: a pretty good song youll sometimes hear on the radio 9/10 <br />Suck my Kiss: one of the heavier songs on the CD 10/10 <br />By the Way: another kind of heavy song 10/10 <br />Parallel universe: another really good song with a really cool chorus 10/10 <br />Breaking the Girl: this song is another mellow song 9/10 <br />My friends: only song on the CD from the Dave Navvaro period another slow song 10/10 <br />Higher ground: only song on the cd from the 80s period 10/10 <br />universally Speaking: another good song 9/10 <br />Road Trippin: another mellow song but its not that good 6/10 <br />Fortune Faded: better of the two unrealesed songs 10/10 <br />Save the population: worst of the two unrealesed songs 8/10 <br /> <br />So in conclusion buy the F***ing CD it kicks ass. And yeah if you like mellow stuff get the cd and thats it. <br />
6305609705|1.0|This has got to be one of the worst movies ever made. I wouldn't necessarily say in the bottom 10 but it's close. The overall acting was so substandard and transparent. I had expected much more from Marlon Brando and Martin Sheen. Both acted like they had something to prove to the world, which they don't. Both are great actors in their own respective ways but this movie did not do them justice.

In Atonement, a 13 year old girl does something dramatic that she'll regret for the rest of her life. Her actions greatly affect the lives of her sister Cecilia, and Cecilia's friend childhood friend Robbie.  <br /> <br />This book is superbly written; the prose is just wonderful. McEwan does an excellent job of describing the characters, and letting us see things through their eyes. The story itself is very entertaining, and has some twists in it to keep you guessing. I highly recommend this book for anyone who loves literature.
B00004U8JU|5.0|This is without a doubt one of the best movies ever. (I am writing a review for all JP movies. Check those out!) This show was just great! First off, the dinosaurs. They looked SO REAL, you could almost touch them! The Rex was the main dino in this movie, and boy did he make a prescence. It was just amazing, and also didn't over sat his prescence. A+. The Velociraptors sounded AWESOME, looked AWESOME, and made the movie AWESOME. And the rest of the dinosaurs were great!!!!!!!!!!<BR>     The acting was also great, on just about evryones part, especially Doc Grant. Loved it.<BR>     GREAT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B00006I53S|5.0|Dollar-for-dollar, this is the best consumer-grade Canon lens available. The focal-length makes it a great walk-around lens. The onboard Image Stabilization allow for crisp zoom shots without a tripod. If your hands shake a lot, this lens will help overcome that.  <br /> <br />On the flip side, I found the Macro option provides a really startling level of detail up close. I also found the combination of the f3.5 and Image Stabilization to be of great use in low-light, indoor shooting where flash is prohibited. It's a fairly fast-focusing lens, too.  <br /> <br />Even though I have upgraded to an L-series lens, the 28-135 is still a personal favorite. Considering it is 1/3 the price of an L-series lens, I cannot find a single fault with it. Anyone looking for a general-purpose lens for under $500 to compliment their Canon Digital Rebel, Rebel XT, 10D or 20D has found it here.
B0007GAERG|3.0|This cd was very nice i enjoyed it and unlike other cds i could listen to the whole thing. in the cd it has a lyric booklet that guides you through the songs which i think is really great mariah has made such a great improvement i am sure everyone will love it and if you dont your crazy i think you allllllllllllllll should download the song shake it off or go out and buy her cd
B000060MWU|5.0|The above pretty much sums up the movie. The jumbled memories, delusions, and fantasies of a man waiting on death row. An existential nightmare and a true work of art. (And no, i'm not some elitist snob.)
0440211727|5.0|I loved the movie and the book is even better. A Time to Kill gives you a powerful look at family, NAACP, KKK, and politics. Jake Brigance defends a client(Carl Lee)who has killed the 2 men that raped his little girl. Jake must over come one major problem, Carl Lee is black and the men he killed were white. To make this problem worse the case will be tried in Clayton, Mississippi. A HEAVILY white County. This is one Grisham's best.
B0007GAERG|5.0|The 2 star review below states that Mariah successes have been because of good writing, producing, and promoting, and I could not agree more because Mariah writes and co-produces everything she's ever done with the exception of a few covers. However the main reason MARIAH HAS DONE SO WELL IS MARIAH HERSELF AND THE VOICE. Don't be fooled by imitators, Mariah is the original..the reason she doesn't dance is because she doesn't have to..Mariah's Music Box sold 28 million record alone, most artist don't sell that in a career...the Emancipation is the hottest album of the year hands down, and it has more hit singles than Mariah haters, so just sit back...We Belong Together has just become Mariah's 16th, yes 16th #1 song on the Billboard Charts, so as Oprah said herself, if you don't have this album, you're out of it.
0066214122|5.0|The strongest part of this book is the fast paced action. I found the science almost boring(maybe because I have done computer programing), but the plot line and action are better than Crichton's newest book State of Fear(also a great book). I could not read this book fast enough. I was yelling(in my mind)at the characters to run faster, get out of the car, don't trust him, etc... The book is now available in paper back and well worth the $7.99 it costs.
B0007Y08IS|5.0|this must be trey and mat's best bit of satire they have ever done. i mean i literally laughed so hard at some parts that my stomach was cramping. the world they depict is of such truth ,how the american government reacts to things and how the rest of the world suffers for it.  <br /> <br />the actors they unintentionally also make a mockery of is brilliant and colourful <br /> <br />i must say if anyone is looking to have a good laugh or a plain fun experience ,they should definately watch team america

0312323859|5.0|Last year, after meeting author Emily Giffin in my bookstore (where she was buying her first copy of her first book), I read her debut novel SOMETHING BORROWED during a long plane ride. Even though I knew it was better-than-average chick lit. Even though I'm a guy.<br /><br />Its tale of a nice girl named Rachel - who finds romance while misbehaving with her best friend's fiance in the weeks before his wedding - was very fun. In it, I liked how Rachel came off as sympathetic and interesting, someone you could root for, in spite of the terrible thing she did to her \\"best\\" friend, Darcy the bride. In SOMETHING BORROWED, Darcy came off as an entitled, spoiled, superficial, mean girl who always got what she wanted, and watching a villain like that get her comeuppance was part of the book's fun.<br /><br />Of course, Emily Giffin had a twist in mind for the sequel to SOMETHING BORROWED, and the resulting book is a terrific pageturner that surpasses the first one in pretty much every way.<br /><br />The heroine of SOMETHING BLUE is the same spoiled, mean, jilted bride Darcy Rhone. And the new book, thankfully, finds her just as mean and spoiled as before. Giffin doesn't make the mistake of \\"changing\\" the character's voice from the original book. Darcy's self-centered, delusional, greedy, wicked and ... pregnant with a groomsman's baby at the beginning of SOMETHING BLUE. It's a bad situation that would jar anyone, but her fiance's betrayal with her best friend Rachel is what really throws Darcy for a loop.<br /><br />As Darcy tries to recapture her fabulous life, she finds that things are more difficult for her. Accustomed to getting any man she wants to fall in love with her, she suddenly has to fend for herself without her friends, with her reputation tarnished and with morning sickness.<br /><br />At one point, Darcy finds herself robbed of all her usual resources, and, with that, things finally start to turn around for her. But, again, Darcy never changes her voice or changes her methods. If you hated her in SOMETHING BORROWED, you'll still find yourself hating her in this book. But you won't be able to ignore her or turn away.<br /><br />SOMETHING BORROWED, about basically nice people who find themselves doing bad things, was a fun read. SOMETHING BLUE, about awful, manipulative, lying people who learn that they can't always get things their way, is more of a juicy, guilty pleasure. Darcy's hilariously bitchy, and I found myself laughing out loud, unable to put the book down, especially after Darcy meets her match.<br /><br />The fact that Giffin was able to establish a layered antagonist in one book - and then dare to tell another whole book from that antagonist's perspective - shows that she's a very smart, very capable and very good writer. I didn't think SOMETHING BLUE could equal the first book. But it topped it.<br /><br />I bought SOMETHING BLUE on Saturday, and I finished it this afternoon. And I never, ever read things that fast unless they're really, really fun. And the ending, which ties both books up, is terrific and touching.<br /><br />I only hope to see Emily Giffin again soon so I can tell her how much I loved SOMETHING BLUE.r voice or changes her methods.

B00003CXCT|1.0|The reviewer Ryan can eat my shorts. George Lucas is suppose to ADAPT the prequels to the original trilogy, NOT the other way around. Hayden Christiansen SHOULD NOT APPEAR as Anakin Skywalker in Jedi. That makes as much sense as having the little kid play Anakin in Phantom Menance. George Lucas destroyed a masterpiece. These new versions just plain suck. Only morons would think otherwise. But then again these are probably the same morons who actually like the prequels.
0812550706|4.0|Ender's Game was a bit of a surprise to me.  I've read some Classic Sci-fi before and have been a bit let down by it.  Mostly because these tend to focus on ideas rather than character or even plot.  And while the ideas can be intriguing, they tend to make for dry reading.  What Ender's Game does best is focus on the characters and uses them to tell the story and bring across the ideas.  And it's written in such a way that you don't really see that you are being presented these ideas until you put the book down and think about it.   <br /> <br />It's a good story, with an interesting character in a interesting world.  And Card also does some neat work presenting subplots that seem to be more like character building moments.  But what he's really doing is tying everything together.  So those subplots are used to great effect for an excellent ending. <br /> <br />This is the second of Card's books that I've read and I enjoyed it a great deal.  I see that this book is the first of a series, and heck I might even give those a read at some point.  This is a good starting place for readers like me who are just exploring Sci-fi and start with some classics.  And it is definitely one you can read again.
B0002KVUKM|4.0|I was really expecting a schlocky summer film when I heard of this one.  After buying it and watching it I was quite surprised to discover that it was really quite good. <br /> <br />Van Helsing, Gabriel and not Abraham from Dracula, is a mystery.  He was found on the steps of Saint Peter's with no memory.  He was then enlisted by a society that protects the world from evil. <br /> <br />We first meet Van Helsing as he confronts Mr. Hyde at Notre Dame Cathedral.  After that mission he is sent off to deal with Dracula, a vampire.  This is not Stoker's Dracula, but an interesting new creation.  This time Van Helsing is given a guide who's character offers a lot color to the film.  He must stop Dracula before a certain family line is extinguished. <br /> <br />Well, it wouldn't be a good movie if everything went as planned.  With werewolves, vampires and the legacy of Frankenstein running through the film Van Helsing is kept very busy and the audience entertained.  There are some points that seem to have been lifted right from The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen but it is mostly fresh and original.  We see a good number of Universal's classic monsters in a whole new light (we miss the Mummy, Invisible Man, and the Creature especially).  The action is typical these days after things like Buffy, Xena and Charlie's Angels but it seems handled differently. <br /> <br />If you like action, monsters, and good vs. evil then this is a movie to watch.
B000089RVX|4.0|I give it four stars because it isnt perfect in my book. When I first heard this band back in 2003, I was like,,, wow,, something new with a good sound and great lyrics. I will give Amy that, really knows how to write lyrics from the soul. Her vocals on the album,, great. Vocals in a live show,, not as perfect, but hey,, she runs around and exhausts herself, so what can you expect? With Ben Moody no longer in the line up and writing with Evanescence, I'm not sure they will survive to be honest. Between Ben and Amy they created the Evanescence sound and style. Lets see what this new character has. For now he is nothing more than Ben's puppet really. I can sit and play all the songs off this album, so if I can be turned into a trained monkey to play them, pretty much any guitarist can. For the bands sake, he had better hope that he can write or will they call up Ben and say, hey write for us... LMAO. My guess about their future,, well it doesnt look good from here, but then again, he may just suprise us with his talents, one never knows. Now as far as the comments made about they are pop and not really goth. NO THEY ARE NOT GOTH by any means. They were origianlly signed to a christian lable. Ben has done work on the sounds for Passion of the Christ and the ex-keyboardist which I cannot remember his name at the moment is a Grammy winner pianist/vocalist doing Christian music. As far as the poppy sound, yeppers its there, but with Ben's guitar riffs they make it not as poppy as it would have been if he wouldnt have made them as hard and crunchy, not a metal or deathcore or goth guitar, but still a solid guitarist with good original style I will give Ben that. I am not here trying to put down this band, Amy, nor Ben. The album is what it is. It is well done, the production was done purposfully for the radio. If anyone out there has the origianl Origin they know that most of Fallen is nothing more the redos from Origin. So in a sense, these songs are old as dirt by now. Buy it if you wish, you will dig it, but if you are really into true metal and true Goth, you will not like it Im sure. ENOUGH SAID!uy it if you wish, you will dig it, but if you are really into true metal and true Goth, you will not like it Im sure. ENOUGH SAID!
0743243153|5.0|Not easy reading but worth every second and all the effort that you put in it. While Peck's style is generally engaging and simple, there are times when you might need to re-read his words to get his meaning. This is probably because the subject matter gets your mind working almost from the first word. Each chapter deserves to be read slowly and carefully and therefore, it is not an 'easy' read.<br /><br />This is a book about living; living in a way that sets you apart. It's a book about Life and everything that we normally associate with it and with living. Peck divides the book into four sections: Discipline, Love, Growth & Religion, & Grace. But in these sections he addresses everything from falling in love to solving problems and dealing with pain. The challenge, of course, is doing all of these things in our limited lifetimes, but he writes about that too.<br /><br />Most of us tend to take these `things' for granted; we 'do' them without thinking about the reasons, methods, or the consequences. In the 'The Road Less Traveled', Scott Peck forces us to think about what we do, what we feel, and what we think in different ways that we have not thought of before.<br /><br />Scott Peck combines years of psychotherapy with a natural writing style that attracts the reader and challenges his/her mind. It is not the writing style that makes the book difficult reading (even though there are a few instances in the book when he does become too involved), but the continuous challenge to you mind and to your preconceived ideas. Peck demands that you examine your mind, your feelings and your heart deeply and objectively. Most of us find that difficult.<br /><br />Peck comes across his book as a warm and sensitive person and he makes you feel at ease instantly... What else would you expect from someone whose opening sentence is \\"Life is difficult!\\"
B0009KA7BS|1.0|I can take the fact that it's not faithful to the comic, no comic book movie really is  (With the exception of Sin City) but when the movie is done this badly, you have to stand up and call it like it is. Not only does this disgrace the popular comic book with a screenplay so poorly written that it makes junior high school term papers seem more intelligent but it has possible the worse actor playing the title role. Keanu Reeves is not only miscast, he's down right dangerous to the movie because you don't believe for one minute that he is the character. Someone wrote that he looked like he was doing a Batman impersonation and I have to agree with that because the John Constantine of the comic book was never as grim as his performance. Not only that but the comic book character fought his enemies with his wits than the gun Keanu brands in the movie plus he knew what he was doing, something Keanu's character seems like he never does. The story rips off several storylines from past issues of the comic book and does them no justice at all with how bad the screenplay is written.  Most of the performances are hit and miss with the exception of the performance of Rachel Weisz, who I agree with the majority who have written their views here and everywhere else is excellent and deserves a much better movie than this. She gives way too much talent and class to this movie and does almost make you want to look pass its huge problems because of her effort but she's the only good thing that this movie has going for it while the rest of it almost bores you to sleep with scenes that are paced too slowly and dialog that is flat out so stupid that you really can't believe on what you are hearing from some of the character's mouths from time to time. The creature effects look horrible and the world of hell loses its luster after the first time you see it. Some of the special effects are shot in the dark and you really can't see certain scenes from time to time.  I think the director was trying to give a kind of noir feel to the film but back out on what noir really means because he rather copy on what was done before than to come up with something truly original.    If you like to watch bad movies, then have yourself a good time, because the movie is that bad but if you looking for a good film that respects the comic book, this is not it.
B0007Y08IS|5.0|The creativity and sharp, oft vulgar wit of Trey Parker and Matt Stone is on full display in this work.  If you are reading this page you know the basics of what this film is about.  The zeitgeist is so vapid that we have begun to attach little meaning adjectives and other descriptors, but I promise you that 'Team America' is incredibly hilarious and thought provoking (in a wonderfully light sort of way).  What's more...Roger Eibert hated the movie, and demonstrated one of two things; either he doesn't watch movies he reviews or he is an incredibly unobservant individual...If you ask me I think he is still having trouble with the fatty foods!
0440237688|4.0|I thought that the Giver was a very good book. It is strange in a cool way. It was so adictive that the first time I read it I litterally could not put it down.Even though my sister was reading it for school the first time I saw it I read it straight through without stopping.It has great chapter endings that make you want to keep going(not like you wouldn't already).It makes you think questions like:where does it take place? what is Elsewhere? Overall i'd say  that the Giver is a lot better than Harry Potter.   Piggies Rock!
6304498969|5.0|I bought this album as an audio cassette when it was first released. It's always a joy to see how good it was played by Eric. Then I bought the CD. I rented a VHS tape and since then I waited long enough to buy the DVD version. It was a concert experience you rockers (especially guitar lovers)out there should not dare miss in your collection. Even I will not have a chance to see Eric in person, at least I have this DVD. It's simply amazing!!! You'll watch it over and over again.
0316172324|5.0|This book was thoroughly enjoyable. I must confess that until now I didn't realize how much thin-slicing I do in my life fortunately most of it in a positive way and the few negative misuses are not significant, whew! <br /> <br />Mr Gladwell carefully and simply elucidates the essence of thin slicing and when and how to apply it judiciousily. It really does make you question your dearly held preconceptions.  <br /> <br />I frind most touching chapters six and seven dealing with Diallo to be highly enlightening as well as saddening, as  these scenarios will undoubtledly continue to be played out in major cities. <br /> <br />Once again thanks a great and fun read. <br />
B00097A5I6|5.0|Just bought this before midnight! This is the album that all Oasis fans have been waiting for! It's funky, raw and a breath of fresh air. This album is their most energetic effort yet. <br /> <br />Have Oasis evolved??! Or have they just woken up? This album is GREAT. If you are a big Oasis fan then you MUST buy this record because your love for this band is about to be renewed.
B000002KIE|5.0|Okay, the original lineup for the Sex Pistols was this: <br />Johnny Rotten-vocals <br />Steve Jones-guitar <br />Glen Matlock-bass <br />Paul Cook-drums <br /> <br />These were the four who played on the band's first single, 'Anarchy in the U.K.'  Then, Matlock was fired and replaced by Sid Vicious, who COULD NOT PLAY HIS INSTRUMENT.  HE HAD ABSOLUTELY NO TALENT AT ALL.  You may ask, well, then who played the bass? The group rehired Glen Matlock as a session musician on their next single, and their one and only album, 'Never Mind the Bollocks, Here's the Sex Pistols.'  You may also may wonder who played bass in concerts.  Well, to avoid the problem of Sid Vicious messing up all the songs, they just turned the bass all the way down.  Anyway, this is all right, and if anything conflicts with this, it is WRONG.   <br /> <br />By the way, the album is a must-have.
B0007TKNL0|5.0|I LOVE this movie so much. I saw it in theatres twice, bought the special edition soundtrack, and now have added this movie to my collection. It is amazing! You probably already know the storyline. Gerard Butler plays the Phantom, Emmy Rossum plays Christine and Patrick Wilson plays Raoul. I think they all did a superb job, I love Gerard Butler as the Phantom. He has an edge to him that makes him a good phantom, and he is a good singer. It is hard to believe that Emmy Rossum was only 16 when she made this movie, she has the voice of an angel! Patrick Wilson plays a good knight on a white horse. In this movie, Raoul has a more prominent role, and actually IS a hero on a white horse. You get more of a sense of why Christine is so torn between these two men. In the play, Raoul wasn't that noticable!<br />On the second disc, there are some interesting tidbits. There is a history of the Phantom of the Opera itself. It mostly shows the London musical play though, which is disappointing. I admit, I did not watch all of it. There is also a Making Of Phantom of the Opera, the movie, which is really interesting. It's at least half an hour, and talks about all aspects of the movie including the dancing, costumes, sets, props, and actors. That is a really interesting bit. Thirdly there is a additional scene featuring the Phantom. It has Gerard Butler singing a version of &quot;Learn to be Lonely&quot;, except personalized for the Phantom. It is an interesting scene, because it shows more of the phantom's lair, and an inside look at his world. It shows his sentimental side :) Also, some people may not have noticed, but below the scene there is another button you can highlight, and if you click it it opens a sing a long. You get the whole backstage crew and some of the cast singing The Phantom of the Opera. It is quite funny to watch!<br />All in all, this is a great addition to any Phantom Phan's collection. I hope this has been of help!
B0007TKNL0|5.0|Sometimes I wonder about writing a review, because other people have said it already.  The value in these cases, I suppose, lies in adding weight to an expressed viewpoint.  So...<br /><br />First, it has been said that those who dislike Webber's musicals, or Joel Schumacher's movies, might dislike this movie...probably true, and is this really a surprise?  In any event, I watched this movie on DVD this past weekend with my wife--a moderate Phantom fan--and two friends who like me are huge fans of the musical Phantom and have seen it multiple times.  We all thought the movie was an excellent film translation of the musical.  (And the three of us who are big Phantom fans had been concerned whether this movie would fall flat like so many other musical to film examples.)<br /><br />As far as the diehard fans of the ALW musical...I think people should approach this movie with an open mind, and admit I may not have.  We all agreed after watching the movie that Butler was a bit of a weak Phantom from the singing standpoint, but acted the part with great skill and intensity.  But after reflecting a few days, I think Stephen King is right...people get hung up on one expression of a character by an actor, and don't keep an open mind when a new expression of that character comes along from a different actor.  Butler is good.  He's not Michael Crawford, but that is not necessarily a bad thing.  Butler creates a new Phantom, and does a pretty good job on Music of the Night and a powerful Point of No Return.<br /><br />Emmy Rossum was fabulous as Christine in all respects...perhaps not Sarah Brightman, but that is not a problem unless you make it one.  (Really, Emmy is beyond good enough.  I think the good buzz surrounding her performance is well-deserved.  I further think she proves more than one person can inhabit and own a role, even a popular character.)  We were OK with Patrick Wilson, who played Raoul--I didn't think he was wooden, exactly, but I'll admit he was not inspiring the way many actors have made Raoul in musical productions.  On this I'll stick to my guns...this isn't a comparison with the musical issue.  Wilson simply does not put the depth of emotion into Raoul that should be there.  Other characters were pretty good.  I think Minnie Driver was great, and do not think it is relevant her songs were dubbed.<br /><br />Schumacher's vision for the movie was, I think, very impressive overall.  Yes, there may be some over-the-top elements.  Yet there are also truly wonderful scenes, in particular the opening sequence as the Phantom theme plays and the theater is transformed, Christine's scene in the graveyard, and the final parts of the movie.  I know I'm forgetting some.  The costumes and sets are amazing; the special effects are both good and not overwhelming.  Upshot...We were mesmerized watching this movie.<br /><br />I'm buying this DVD when I finish writing this review.  If you love the musical Phantom, you will probably at least like this movie, and maybe more.  Would it have been nice to see Michael Crawford and Sarah Brightman in a movie version of Phantom?  Sure, I guess, twenty years ago.  On the other hand, in 2005 this is the movie we have to see, and I think it is well-worth seeing and adding to your library, and that all concerned did a great job.rs have made Raoul in musical productions.

B00064AM6C|5.0|This DVD is awesome!!!  I had always thought the White Stripes were great, but I had no idea how good they were in concert until now.  The film itself is also a well-edited and fine compliment to the atmosphere set by Jack and Meg.  The grainy quality just reflects their minimalist style.  The setlist is also great, with all their hits, including \\"De Ballit of De Boll Weevil,\\" which, for some reason, I always find myself singing in the shower.  It can also change your mind about some tracks you didn't like before.  For example, I never really got into songs like \\"When I Hear My Name,\\" \\"Black Math,\\" \\"Do,\\" or \\"The Big Three\\" until I heard them in concert.  In fact, every song they play sounds better live.  As a whole, the movie is great and definitely worth buying if you're into the White Stripes.  Now, the review aside, does anybody out there have extra Midtown Music Festival tickets they don't want?  I've been trying to get tickets the last three weeks so I could see the White Stripes before they go to Argentina or wherever without paying $200 for the tickets.  I mean it's crazy!  How can they deprive the world of the White Stripes like this?!?!  What is the world coming to?
B000787WVK|5.0|It is too bad that Boito did not not write more music.  His melodic gift is stupendous.  Try NOT to join in the chorus that concludes the Helen of Troy act.  What notes!  All the singers are wonderful, Freni giving a blockbuster portrayal.  What a glorious spinto voice this is, always used to thrilling effect.  Buy it.  It cost mee $50 years ago and now it's cheap!
B000002GJH|3.0|In 1990, Andy Wood, singer for Mother Love Bone, died of a heroin overdose.  The rest of the band, including guitarist Stone Gossard and bassist Jeff Ament, between the trauma of losing their friend and vocalist, decided it was time to fold the band.  Gossard and Ament decided to go on, and formed a new band that eventually would become Pearl Jam.  While that band was working on its demos, Gossard and Ament, joined by guitarist Mike McCready (also involved in the blooming Pearl Jam project), and friends of Andrew Wood, singer Chris Cornell and drummer Matt Cameron from Soundgarden, put together an album in tribute to their lost friend.  Cornell had written a pair of songs, largely in the style of Mother Love Bone (and pointing in the direction that Soundgarden would go), and these guys came together to record it.  Along the way, the vocalist that Gossard and Ament had found for their project, the  then-unknown Eddie Vedder, sung a lead and a few backing vocals. <br /> <br />This album languished in obscurity until long after its release, when during Pearl Jam's rise, A&M released \\"Hunger Strike\\" (with a vocal duet between Vedder and Cornell) as a single, and suddenly the album received more exposure.  When listened side-by-side to Mother Love Bone's \\"Apple\\", its clear this is the successor to that record, although it has a loose feel to it-- this project was a quick thing and it shows-- sometimes its good in that the songs have a great feel to them, but sometimes it causes the material to fall short as its a bit underdeveloped. <br /> <br />But what's good is great, and those two songs Cornell wrote about his friend are overwhelming-- there's little to describe the magic of \\"Say Hello 2 Heaven\\" and \\"Reach Down\\" without actually hearing them except that they are epic, powerful, and moving and are among the best Cornell has ever written. <br /> <br />The album's hit, \\"Hunger Strike\\", is actually a bit weaker of a composition, but whoever hit on the idea of having Vedder sing part of it was brilliant-- Vedder's rich tenor allows the some to take on a bigger resonance than Cornell, and Vedder delivers the lyrics with a telling depth reflective of his social concerns. <br /> <br />The truth is though, the loose feel of the record does hamper a lot of it-- \\"Pushing Forward Back\\", \\"Wooden Jesus\\", and \\"All Night Thing\\" show signs of needing more time, although countering this, \\"Call Me a Dog\\" is a fantastic record with a depth of emotion from Cornell and \\"Times of Trouble\\" (later a Pearl Jam b-side with Vedder's vocal and lyrics instead of Cornell's as \\"Footsteps\\") is superb. <br /> <br />There's enough good material to make it worth having for Pearl Jam, Soundgarden, or Mother Love Bone fans, but its unlikely anyone else will find much interest in this.
B000063DFN|5.0|One of my top 10 favorite rock albums. Love every song. For ten dollars, you'd have to be a total dumbazz to not pick this up. <br />Tracks: <br />1.

B000001DWG|4.0|In the early '90s, Pearl Jam acheived seemingly boundless success with their blend of the grunge aesthetic with the sounds and sensibilities of arena rock.  But before Pearl Jam there was Mother Love Bone, and had Andrew Wood not died of a heroin overdose, they would have been in Pearl Jam's place.  This collection, gathering all the material the band released-- an EP (\\"Shine\\") and an album (\\"Apple\\") with an additional previously unreleased track, is proof of that. <br /> <br />Drawing their sound from a number of different directions, it does sound quite a bit like Pearl Jam's early material-- the presence of guitarist Stone Gossard and bassist Jeff Ament (who pretty much wrote all of \\"Ten\\") would guarantee this.  But in place of Eddie Vedder's punk-sensibility vocals is something altogether over-the-top-- Andrew Wood sounds probably closest to Perry Farrell (Jane's Addiction) in timber, but his style is similar to Freddie Mercury (Queen) and Ian Astbury (the Cult) than anything else.  While Wood doesn't have Vedder's ability to quite expose his soul vocally-- there's no \\"Black\\" here, although \\"Man of Golden Words\\" comes close, there's nothing in Pearl Jam's catalog quite like the energetic and frantic arena rock of \\"This is Shangrila\\" and \\"Capricorn Sister\\", and \\"Crown of Thorns\\" is pure magic.  Also of note is how much like \\"Alive\\" \\"Stardog Champion\\" feels-- thematically different, but its clear the same composer wrote both pieces. <br /> <br />There's a temptation to let legend get in the way of reality, and the truth is that these recordings are not perfect-- the middle of \\"Apple\\" ranges from overly ambitious (\\"Bone China\\") to pretentious (\\"Stargazer\\") to dull (\\"Come Bite the Apple\\", \\"Heartshine\\"), but its a debut album-- these have flaws, certainly contrary to what I thought when it first came out, \\"Ten\\" has its share. <br /> <br />In the end, these recordings are essential for Pearl Jam fans looking for context, and certainly its completeness increases the attractiveness of the set.  Recommended.
B0007QJ1MK|2.0|The CD is ok. Not great, not horrid.  <br /> <br />I only enjoyed maybe 4 songs max on this CD, and yes Little Suster was one of those 4. My advice would be to wait until you can get the CD for under 10 bucks, then make your own decision.
B000687M48|5.0|Anybody who thinks that Amy Lee can't match her studio work with live performance is simply incorrect.  She's the second best rock singer right now (after Johnette Napolitano), which is amazing given her age.  The band is superbly tight, but the lead guitar needs work (which I'm sure will come).  Great songs.  Wish I knew where they came from--I'd go get some myself (ha!)  The mix is a little weird, but I still like it better than _Fallen_.
B0007Y4TVU|1.0|For a CD that is long over due. It sucked. The older stuff was much better. <br /> <br />System of a Down is starting to turn into another band that has lyrics that make absolutely no sense, and only uses them to fill empty space. When are musicians going to stop politicising thier music and just make good music? Shut up and play.
B00006F7IM|5.0|If you want to have some fun ... along the lines of watching the Miracle Mets win it all in 1969 ... this is a movie for you.<br /><br />\\"Major League\\" is David Ward's baby.  He wrote the story.  He wrote the script.  He even directed it.  It's a story about the Cleveland Indians ... a collection of cast-offs and misfits ... who defy the experts (and their own team owner) and find the winning formula.<br /><br />The script is very excellent.  There are more than a few gems (really memorable or funny lines) but it is all a very believable dialog.  Even the swear words (and there are quite a few of those here as well) are perfectly apt.<br /><br />The casting is top-notch ... with selecting James Gammon to be the manager Lou Brown perhaps being the best hire.<br /><br />The acting is superior, thoroughly superior, to most movies.  We tend to discount the quality of the acting when it is in a comedy, but, for this movie, we shouldn't.  Even the smaller roles are filled out with pretty good performances.<br /><br />Tom Berenger as Jake Taylor ... the washed up ball player who gets one more taste of stardom ... is superb.  We like Jake, we trust him, and we want him to win.  He's been a carouser, but we know he's better than that, and will, given this new chance, make good.  That is Tom Berenger doing a good acting job.  Rene Russo as Lynn Wells (Jake's love interest) does a nice job of walking the line between her logic and her heart.  Here she is caring and vulnerable ... wise but, at the same time, unwise.  In short, she is lovable.  Corbin Bernsen plays the overpaid ballplayer Roger Dorn, and he doesn't really make the part work.  Dorn is supposed to be a prima donna, and he (Corbin) does all right with that part of it, but he never really comes across ... convincingly ... as a baseball player.  He tries, but can't quite pull it off.  Charlie Sheen as Rick Vaughn is my pick for the MVP (most valuable performer) of this movie.  Vaughn is a punk ... \\"Wild Thing\\" ... a pitcher with an attitude problem (and a 97 mph fastball) ... and a fan favorite.  Charlie doesn't have a lot of lines here, but he makes them count ... just a very excellent job of acting, I think.  Margaret Whitton plays Rachel Phelps ... the mean lady team owner ... and she is ... wonderful.  She has to lose all of her dignity to make the part work ... and she does.  She spews hated and venom ... all within the framework of a comedy ... and is miserable (and delighfully so) when the team manages to win.  Just a great job ... and a deft touch ... at comedic acting.  Wesley Snipes plays Willie Mays Hayes, the speedster lead-off man.  You can tell he (Wesley) tried hard to make the character believable ... and he succeeded.  James Gammon as Lou Brown, the team's manager, is perfect for the part.  His deadpan \\"I've seen it all\\" delivery is very much like the real life, over-seasoned, veteran baseball skipper he portrays.  Bob Uecker as the announcer Harry Doyle keeps things moving with his witty and baseball-savvy commentary.  And Chelcie Ross, who plays the aging pitcher Eddie Harris, gives a quite true-to-life portrayal, I felt.<br /><br />The story moves along at a nice pace, and there is comedy in pretty much every scene.  The crowd scenes in the stadium (near the end of the picture) are incredible.  They must have done the filming at a real Indians game.  And the \\"Wild Thing\\" song scene ... when Charlie Sheen's character walks in from the bull pen ... is absolutely great.  Just an extremely fun moment for us movie watchers to enjoy.<br /><br />Complaints?  Yep.  Two.  The Cerrano character.  He is a surly voodoo practicing defector from Cuba, and his surliness and voodoo are catered to in the movie.  Also, we are force-fed high society and higher learning.  OK.  Here's what happens:  Jake (the Tom Berenger character) takes Willie and Rick (Wesley Snipes and Charlie Sheen) to an expensive French restaurant, where the menu is even in French.  Right.  While there, he (Jake) spots his old flame (Rene Russo as Lynn Wells) and they re-connect.  She is now into literature big-time, and she's also engaged to marry an incredibly rich attorney.  She (later) chastises Jake for not having read at least some of the classics, and he, Jake, gives in and reads \\"Moby Dick\\".  Right.  This sort of scenario happens to a big league baseball player all the time.  Why not just let Lynn be a regular gal ... someone who is trying to forge a decent life for herself ... when she falls (again) for the charming big leaguer?<br /><br />Still, the romance between Tom Berenger and Rene Russo works quite nicely.  They make a good on-screen couple ... and there's one song on the soundtrack that adds to the romantic atmosphere ... and when Lynn decides to dump the rich lawyer and go back with Jake (Well, I guess it could happen) ... and the team wins the big game ... it all makes for a very happy ending ... one that gives a substantial tug on your heartstrings.While there, he (Jake) spots his old flame (Rene Russo as Lynn Wells) and they re-connect.

B000002Q88|5.0|I am a huge Kansas fan from the 70s. I have liked them since 1976. This cd is remarkable for a number of reasons. They attempted to do something completely different- a concept album. The concept is interesting and touching. Walsh has some great vocal moments. Ezrin seems to get the best out of the band. Highlights include Ghosts, Stand Beside Me, House on Fire, I Counted On Love, Rainmaker and the beautiful and inspiring Bells of St.James. Who said there wasn't anything progressive and interesting coming out in the late 80s? I know it was a hairy time but Kansas was still putting out quality stuff- too bad they're putting out only compilations now.
B00004Y6NP|4.0|This is overall a pretty great CD for the big 4 even the most popular song, \\"Money for Nothing\\" which would be my favorite song <br />on this CD. I love the riff on \\"Brothers in Arms\\" at the end! \\"So <br />Far Away\\" is a great album opener! \\"Walk of Life\\" is another classic that listeners liked after hearing \\"Money for Nothing\\".  <br />\\"Money for Nothing\\" is a track that you can listen to over N' over again for sure, plus this version is even better than the single edit version. It is 8 minutes and 26 seconds that song lasts. If you are a fan to Dire Straits, then you must want this CD and buy it just for the 4. I also reccomend you these albums. <br /> <br />ON EVERY STREET <br />MAKING MOVIES <br />LOVE OVER GOLD <br /> <br />These are my 3 favorite albums of all time!
B0007GAERG|3.0|Mariah really has emancipated her style. Kudos for her keeping her diva vocals, but she is losing herself in booty-style songs while trying to stay glamorous. It is definitely original, but not so hot. I love the first 2 tracks, and it is all downhill from there. Maybe she should stick to her orginal genre and skip a copycat booty-Beyonce journey. Mimi needs her own image, since she is unique and God-talented.
B0002D6JX2|5.0|I first heard of her through a few friends from overseas.  I decided to check out a few songs and it wasn't long before I was hooked!  She has a beautiful voice, perfect for the style of music she performs on this disk.  Although her music is aimed more at the teen age group, it's not as poppy as Britney or Christina.  It should appeal to adults and kids alike.  I urge you all to check out &quot;Innocent Eyes&quot; and &quot;In My Own Time&quot; as well as the first single &quot;Born to Try.&quot;<br />I also strongly reccommend her second album, Mistaken Identity.

0156027321|4.0|Esentially, The Life of Pi is divided into two separate but related sections.  The first part covers the childhood of the hero, Pi.  I found this part fascinating for its insights into French-dominated areas of India and Pi's understanding of the universality of faith. <br /> <br />This faith is carried over metaphorically into the second half of the book.  This is where the book loses steam.  The metaphor is a bit weak at times and the story becomes beyond incredulous.   <br /> <br />Overall, this is a good book, but it is not a great book.
0812550706|4.0|Ender's Game is certainly a curious and perhaps unique piece of science fiction.  Yes, it does have the requisite space travel and alien encounters.  However the main thrust of the book involves the preparation of warfare, specifically the toughening up of a young boy (Ender Wiggin) destined to save mankind.  So Ender's Game is much more a book for students of military tactics than fans of science fiction.  I am neither and so ... I'm either the best person to submit a book review, or the worst person! <br /> <br />As for the story, hmmm... it's a bit complicated.  Some time in the future Earth is threatened repeated by insect-like aliens, curiously referred to as 'buggers'.  After many years of searching a young boy is found who can be trained, at times in a most brutal fashion, to can lead mankind in victory over the enemy.  Lots of sometimes interesting, often boring battle simulations ensue.  And the promised \\"war of the worlds\\" comes towards the end of the book, ... and I admit it's a damn good ending. <br /> <br />Clearly the author deserves kudos on the military/battle elements of Ender's Game.  However I found a very basic premise of the book hard to swallow.  Ender Wiggin is chosen as the prospective chosen leader to save mankind when he was *six years old*.  However his actions and thoughts are clearly mature, as are those of his siblings (..who are also exceptionally gifted, and a bit strange).  I don't understand why the author chose the hero to be a young boy.  I can understand perhaps in several millenia children growing up faster but I'm afraid the author has distorted this notion all out of proportion.   <br /> <br /> <br />Bottom line: despite its flaws Ender's Game is a very interesting read.
B000301YY8|5.0|I heard one of his songs on the radio - bought the Cd on the strength of that one and was really impressed. It's true what one of the other reviewers said - it is the sort of album you can put on and listen to the entire CD without being disappointed. Buy it!
B000268QB2|4.0|I saw them for the first time in \\" Saturday night live\\" and I loved them. I think if John Lennon were alive, he would had made this kind of music, specially \\" Somewhere only we know\\". I will tell you more as soon as I receive my copy, that I've just ordered. I am waiting for them to come to South Florida for a concert. I heard they put a good performance.
B00080ZG10|4.0|I liked \\"The Aviator\\" more than I suspected I would.  Like most people, I knew about Hughes' later years as the mad recluse who died so pathetically with vultures picking at the bones of his vast empire that he left intestate.  While I also knew some things about the technological prowess of his companies and their role in the Cold War and the exploration of space, I did know a little about his beginnings and the extent of his personal involvement in the development of commercial aviation.<br /><br />So, telling this story is interesting.  We get to see his passion for flight and his obsession for planes that flew higher, faster, further.  I like flying and found all of that fascinating.  What I knew almost nothing about was his early and extreme forays into filmmaking and his battles with the studio system and the censors.<br /><br />I think this film succeeds on multiple levels.  It tells the story of Howard Hughes as a man possessed with genius for all things technical.  Being blessed with family wealth, he could use his boundless energy to pursue whatever he decided to throw himself into.  We also get to see his almost completely unsuccessful attempts at personal relationships.  It wasn't that he didn't try, it is more that he was incapable of mutuality in his interpersonal relations.<br /><br />The film, and especially DiCaprio, succeeds in bringing Hughes to life and shows us how his early quirks and eccentricities grew into a full blown and toxic madness after the plane crash that nearly took his life (although the film does not show us his use and abuse of narcotics after this time).  The film leaves us with no doubt about where Hughes was headed, but ends shortly after the flight of the huge wooden Hercules (the Spruce Goose).  Hughes is portrayed sympathetically, but honestly and that is a very complex achievement.<br /><br />However, I was most awed by the way the film brought the culture of Hollywood in the twenties, thirties, and forties to life.  The scenes in the Coconut Grove are just wonderful.  The musical portrayals of the Wainwright clan are terrific not only musically, but in the style and energy of the music in those decades.<br /><br />The extras on the second DVD are almost endless.  You will get to see how the music is made, watch a full TV biography of Hughes, learn about OCD, watch Alda and DiCaprio talk about the film and acting, learn about the set designs, costumes, the film score, and more.e are just wonderful.

B00079HZUM|4.0|Billy Crudup is tremendous as the 17th century actor, Ned Kynaston.  I'll admit I'm prepared to be impressed by any straight actor who can convincingly portray bisexuality, but I think Crudup's commitment to this role should thrill anyone.  He looks perfectly masculine as a man - he doesn't have a noticeably feminine face - and yet in drag he's believably female, if a bit affected.  That affectation, though, is clearly a product of Ned's training for the stage, where actors of the age were expected to make grand gestures and pronouncements rather than appear \\"natural.\\"  Throughout most of the film, Ned defends this and the tradition of men playing women as a sign of greater depth to the acting - after all, how can art be art if it's too much like life? <br /> <br />Of course, in modern times we're trained to the opposite - most art these days arises explicitly from \\"real life,\\" a bias that touches the end of this film.  Ned has an epiphany and switches to what is essentially method acting, becoming a 17th century Marlon Brando.  It's clear that Stage Beauty's writers and actors were turned on by this development in spite of its anachronism, and their enthusiasm is contagious.  In the DVD extras, too, they are at great pains to explain that none of the story is meant to be historically accurate.  However, that's a weak excuse for a film based on real-life characters, and the story is close enough to reality that I find the method acting resolution difficult to believe. <br /> <br />The other problem with the switch to method acting is that it serves as reinforcement for traditional gender roles, although exactly how that works in the film is a bit difficult to explain here.  But I fear that many people will come away from this movie with the message that Ned was cured of his femininity and the homosexual side of his bisexuality, when I believe that what he really does is discover that he can be both male and female - he doesn't have to choose.  It's my sense that Nedwas supposed to be a genuinely bisexual person - although his steady lover is a man, the first sexual situation we see him in involves women.  Following this line of thought, it makes perfect sense that he could fall in love with Claire Danes's Maria.  And indeed I found the scene where they discuss \\"how men do it\\" before doing it themselves quite touching and genuine.  Nevertheless, that scene could easily be interpreted differently, and while that ambiguity is nice fodder for thought, it's also ultimately frustrating. <br /> <br />Still, for anyone interested in gender politics or the history of acting, this is a movie worth seeing.  Unfortunately, Stage Beauty suffers from an uninspiring title and lack of promotion, and as a result everyone I've talked to about it has never heard of it.  I think it could do very well as a DVD by word-of-mouth, though - so watch it, and then speak up!
B00006JL1Z|5.0|I respect Stevie Nicks, she has a great singing voice, and her lyrics are beautiful, shes also very beautiful. I respect any women that can sing and write. Stevie Nicks would have to be one of my favorite women singers along with Joplin. Fleetwood Mac would have to be one of the best classic rock bands ever.
B0007CNXUK|3.0|I tried to like this movie, I really did, but it just didn't hit a chord with me. The movie is loosely based on the life of J.M. Barrie, the writer of the `Peter Pan' story. The writers of the movie manipulated the facts to get a warm fuzzy effect of the movie that I guess is supposed to leave you feeling inspired, though it didn't with me.<br /><br />Basically, the plot is rather mediocre. To sum up, Barrie meets a widowed woman and her son's in the park and they develop a friendship. Actually, I would consider Barrie more than just a `family friend'; he takes it a step further in my opinion. However, the writers of the movie made it obvious that their friendship was totally asexual (even with the mother). Essentially, the rest of the movie is him pretend-playing with these boys, thusly getting the inspiration for his famous play, `Peter Pan'. In the middle of this his wife gets annoyed that he's spending so much time with this family and leaves him (who could blame her). I wont say anything else about the plot because I don't want to spoil it, but that's pretty much it in a nut shell. The concept of the story is great; triumph of art, creativity, and playfulness over snootiness and growing-up.  However, I feel it was poorly executed in the movie. The acting and the visuals were pretty good, but the plot seriously lacked momentum.<br /><br />On a side note, it's funny how the movie completely mirrors Michael Jackson. You have a man who, for some reason, has this need to fill a void in his life by pretend-playing with young boys. This man completely refuses to `grow-up' and take on the normal responsibilities of adulthood such as tending to relationships and commitments.<br /><br />This movie is good for a rental. It's really nothing great.
B00005V3Z4|5.0|When I saw this movie I was about 13 which wasnt to long ago, I thought to myself \\"What's going on?\\" But soon I realized what was going on. The movie is based on a boy who has a bunny in his head name Frank who was killed on Halloween night(the bunny suit), and Donnie was working on time traveling. The story ends that instead of him dying in the beinging he died at the ending, the young girl he met never knew who he was, and all the things that happened never happened. Donnie also shot Frank for killing the girl he loved, Its a most see movie.
B000002KBU|5.0|For a pop album to have impact for 30 years is an amazing thing.  And this one is amazing.  The best thing that Joni Mitchell ever did and one of the best albums ever made in the \\"golden era\\" of alternative pop.  I can't listen to most of the music I loved when I was a kid.  It just doesn't hold up for me.  But this album is different.  It's been decades and I don't tire of it.<br /><br />Listen to just about any thoughtful singer/songwriter today and you can hear the influence of this album.  It was groundbreaking.  And no singer/songwriter today comes close to being brilliantly consistent on one album as Ms. Mitchell did on this one.  \\"Blue\\" is what any songwriter aspires to be able to do.

0316172324|4.0|This extended journalistic essay is a fun ride. I like that Gladwell drew his examples from a wide variety of professions and contexts: the world of marketing and advertising (the Pepsi challenge), the buying and exhibition of antique art (the Getty's purchase of a fraudulant kouros), political campaigning (Warren G. Harding and Bill Clinton), rock music (the not-easy-to-classify artist Kenna), hospital emergency triage work (Cook County Hospital's introduction of a simple diagnotic protocol to determine which chest pain patients were most likely to succumb to a full-blown heart attack), orchestra auditions (the increasing use of \\"blind\\" auditions to force judges to base their assessments solely on what they hear), and police work (the Rodney King and Amadou Diallo fiascos). He augments these ancedotal findings with more scientific studies (such as findings from an extensive breakdown and cataloguing of facial expressions and work with an autistic man). The snap decisions we make, called \\"thin slicing,\\" can help us make urgent, life-saving decisions, or can (under certain circumstances) guide us to make the most disastrous of choices. Gladwell seems to be fair in considering the pros and cons, but in the end his project seems mainly to be to inspire in us a sense of awe for the powerful gift we all have, one which ultimately eludes logical explanation.<br /><br />Great for the beach on long train ride.
B00005B36H|5.0|Tool would have to be Led Zeppelin or Pink Floyd in our year. More like Pink Floyd by the videos. You never see Tool in their videos or even pictures which is makes Tool so cool and mysterious. Maryand did way better in Tool then APC though cause nowadays you see pictures of the band, but Maryand will always have the Robert Plant in him, and many of Tool fans will never forget the talent he had and still does. Tool will always be one of my fav bands ever.
B000001OAA|5.0|Well, the first LP by Garbage...when I first listened to it, I was like...\\"this is the great album\\". It was six or seven years ago I believe at this point. Since then my opinion haven't changed. Garbage's first album is still one of my favorite. I don't know if you'll like it - the prerogative is yours. But maybe I can help you a little bit. Let's go over the tracks.    1. Supervixen - my rating is 9/10. The first track on the album - and the first impression. Of course, it's not one of the main songs, but it sounds really good. I think Supervixen can make you become interested in the following tracks.  2. Queer - 10/10. One of my much loved tracks. I can describe it by one word - intriguing. The title fits perfectly. Just pick the song up and you'll dwell on it. Watch the video also and you'll figure out what I mean.  3. Only Happy When It Rains - 100% 10/10. Great work. \\"Pour your misery down on me\\" and \\"My only comfort is the night gone black\\" - these lines speak for themselves. You can't be indifferent when Shirley sings. The video is great too...as for me, I can't focus on anything else when it's on TV (that happens rarely though). Only Happy When It Rains drives the fans crazy at the shows. As I said before - great work.  4. As Heaven Is Wide - 9/10. The track lyrically seems quite personal written like the others. Fast tempo playing and a bit slower singing. In my opinion it's kind of a first bridge for the next songs on the album.  5. Not My Idea - 9/10 or around. I really like this song. I know, Garbage's not the band to give you only optimistic feelings...but this track always keeps me energetic. It's not for jogging, of course!  6. A Stroke Of Luck - 9,5/10. One of my favorite pieces. The one to touch a chord...and also to give you...maybe almost the whole conception of Garbage.  7. Vow - 10/10. Well, you might have expected that I use this mark only for singles. I think every song on the album is a potential single. Forget that Vow's the single and it'sstill the potential one. The song can really make you say something like...\\"Wow!\\" (if you've never heard it before). The video fits well too.  8. Stupid Girl - 10/10. Another good song. I believe it's the second bridge on the album. Stupid Girl is easy to remember and hard to forget. The idea of the song isn't hidden in the video so it's not difficult to understand it. The Clash fans can also recognize a loop from Train In Vain.  9. Dog New Tricks - 10/10. \\"Everyone I know has gone away. Died or left or just forgot to stay\\". The lyrics of this song takes you far with the music. You just listen to this song and then it's over and you want it to be played again. That's what I like about it.  10. My Lover's Box - 9,5/10. Shirley's vocals are great. Her amazing voice and Garbage's wonderful music makes you become stuck during the listening. That's a trap, yeah, but it's a damn good one. And My Lover's Box is a 100% element of this trap.  11. Fix Me Now - 8,5/10. My rating is lower here. Well, it's really hard to have an album that contains only masterpieces. That was just a debut record and...I have to say, I like Fix Me Now. The song consists of nice music and lyrics, moreover, it has its own mood - and it DOES matter.  12. Milk - there's no doubt that it's 10/10...20/10 to be honest. I usually don't listen to this song during the day. Night is a perfect time for me...maybe that's why I'm into Garbage. The song's a really sadly-driven one. It's perfect, in my opinion. Listen to the sample here and try to think then. If you feel the same just for a while...it'll be the first step to become a fan, I guess.    Well, you've come a long way. What do you think?
B0002OERI0|1.0|Green Day I will admit was good in the 90s. Dookie was the best album they had but I never did find myself liking this one. MTV always play it and it sounds like poltics I hate poltics. But before you think I judge bands think again cause I dont judge them before I know who they are. I listen to the music then I can decide if I like them. For example the other newer punk bands I listened to them before I judged them. Many people are trying to be these bands now, which is kinda \\"poser\\". The word poser is overrated I know but dressing up as someone or something your not is not who to be. Why cant people just be theirselfs, and like the bands not look up to them and wish you were them. Green Day has a talented vocalist Bille but I dont really find myself into Green Day anymore.
0515123447|5.0|I saw an ad in the magazine calling Lee Child the next big thing, so I ran to the library to start at the beginning of the Jack Reacher series...and it was well worth it.  While the book is not perfect (and few books are), it had suspense all the way to the final pages.  You could see the potential of both Child and Reacher in this book and he only gets better as the series goes along.  There are a lot of \\"coincidences\\" in this book (like arriving to Georgia on the same day his estranged brother is murdered there).  But Jack Reacher becomes such a cool character that you will root for him again and again in this series.  Lee Child has a way with humor, too (often dry as he is British), and you know you have talent when you make a reader laugh aloud as Reacher is killing someone to protect the town.  In conclusion, I think Child has done a lot of research (although other reviewers might disagree) and I am constantly learning things from this series, and most importantly, they are just great reads that will keep you guessing all the way, give you Ah-ha moments, and leave you wanting more.  Highly recommended!

B000929AJQ|4.0|Instead of writing layered, conceptual, electronic rock, Nine Inch Nails front man Trent Reznor has opted for a more minimalist and straight forward effort with his 2005 studio release With Teeth. After battling the personal demons of alcohol addiction and financial ruin Reznor is back in good health showing mainstream music listeners that rock can be both personal and yet approachable, commercial yet avant-garde. Throughout With Teeth Reznor blends the dark aggressive tendencies that typified Nine Inch Nails in the early 90's with tracks like \\"You Know What You Are\\" and \\"The Line Begins to Blur\\" with the near millennium release of Fragile'esque more up tempo tracks such as \\"All the Love in the World\\" and \\"Beside You In Time\\". With Teeth and front man Trent Reznor's most applauding merit on this 13 track release is With Teeth's ability to capture its listener within the ferociously hook filled beats that Reznor has masterfully woven into his most recent studio work.<br /><br />  Although 40 Reznor is in top form vocally on With Teeth with tracks such as \\"Only\\" and \\"All the Love in the World\\" that are as reveling as they are melodious with their vocal layering. This album can instantly make even the most jaded and disenfranchised listener begin to nod and move rhythmically in such a visceral fashion that you could even say parts of the album are danceable which as incongruous as it may seems is actually quite refreshing and genuine. All the while holding its listener captive to some degree of restraint in the albums overly dark and vulnerable lyrics which juxtapose the rhythmic nature of the album as a whole.<br /><br />  With Teeth is a Synth Pop Hard Rock throw back that can be and anthem of deep personal revelation to years of broken relationships and hypocrisy as much as it could be a contagious house party album where you move to the thick driving beats of the music only to unearth the sorrow and loss of Reznor's assertive vocals. All and all With Teeth proves to be a album that most likely will push Nine Inch Nails fans who are still clinging to Reznor's past works even further away, while opening up a new form of music for the masses, dark synth rock, hook filled and hell bent. The intensity of With Teeth is still present in a not so formulaic way reminiscent of Pretty Hate Machine era works as long as listeners attempt to understand the arid yet expressive way its presented, which is where most listeners might miss Reznor's methodology and approach.<br /><br />  With Teeth while an incredibly solid and forthright record is undoubtedly Reznor's most humble lyrical performance to date, scrapping much of his descriptive vocabulary as he has recording gear on this album. With Teeth's simplified song structure is unfavorably accompanied by Reznor's newly found exceedingly simplified lyrics, leaving the listen wanting more. Additionally With Teeth is somewhat scattered in it's presentation.<br /><br />  While Listening to the song order of With Teeth one can feel the transitions are too fractal and partitioned and the album would be better suited if the more abrasive and brutal tracks such as \\"With Teeth\\" and \\"The Line Begins to Blur\\" were towards the beginning of the album and then slowly the more euphonic and pop sensible songs began to bridge the musical gap to the more hook driven pop songs such as \\"The Hand That Feeds\\", \\"Only\\" and \\"All the Love in the World\\". If it weren't for the last track \\"Right Where it Belongs\\" the current rendering of with Teeth would seem fragmented and rushed, as if Reznor wanted listeners to put the album on shuffle while listening.<br /><br />  Pound for pound and note for note With Teeth rivals any Nine Inch Nails release that has come before it, it just brings a different arsenal of rhythmic artillery to pummel its listener with. Where Pretty Hate Machine brought electronic 80's pop to the aggressive guitar driven 90's. With Teeth merges yet again new wave synth pop with a more robust and captivating sound repertuar. Where The Downward Spiral created the organic ominous sound that brought Trent Reznor into the mainstream as one of music's great song writers. With Teeth revitalizes the ambiance of discord with its infectious beat driven temperament, one which mainstream rock has lacked since the likes of \\"Closer\\". And to where The Fragile further enlarged the boundaries of conceptual artistic rock music. With Teeth pushes forth its listener in attempts to embrace a new breed of premonitory Synth driven Hard Rock that has only be emulated until now, showing that both Trent Reznor and Nine Inch Nails have yet to lose relevance during the 6 year hiatus in passing. With Teeth as its title suggest has the ferocity Reznor promised with the maturity and refinement his years of skilled song writing and engineering have masterfully cultivated.<br /><br />With Teeth: Nine Inch Nails (9.25/10)<br /><br />However I would higly reccomend the With Teeth import with \\"Home\\" to better round out the record.uar.

1400043662|4.0|To name a novel after an author you are compared to is only the beginning of Murakami's many tricks. Kafka, the author, is credited for creating sub-narratives, ones which exist only in the reader's mind. Murakami is proudly in dept to Kafka, and goes so far as to name a book after him, knowing it will raise a hair or two on all his readers. <br /> <br />Similar to Hard Boiled and Wonderland, the novel is split into alternating chapters. One is of a runaway named Kafka, the other is of a semi-retarded older man named Nakata. Their respective stories read autonomously at first, but in classic Murakami vein, subtle correlations between the stories start poking around, and one soon becomes suspicious that perhaps the stories run parallel in some dimension. Brilliant handling on reader's tendencies to remember and/or forget things. It's as if Murakami is relying on reader's forgetfulness to play with recollection and dreams. The novel reads at many parts like a dream, in which time and space are absorbed into a small point, only to expand again when pertinent.  <br /> <br />There are traditional plot strategies: a murder, a mystery, and a chase. However, these act as only anchors in the narrative. What Murakami is more interested in is identity, both symbolically (who we are as people) and formally (character aspects in a novel). Murakami plays with classic themes: unrequited love, oedipal complex, abandonment, adolescent loneliness, implications of war, and spiritual pilgrimages.  <br /> <br />What makes this novel very special is that the `mystery' is never solved. Readers are never granted the satisfaction of finding out what really happened. All the characters remain the same; only in the reader's head do the characters bleed into one another. On the written page, there is no proof that anything uncommon actually happened, and when they do, it is attributed as a dream (certain characters sleep for two day stretches during the same time that crazy things happen). Yet, by the end of the novel, we aren't so sure about what exactly happened. Was Miss Saeki Kafka's mother? Did they sleep together? Is Kafka the boy on the shore who died long ago? Is Nakata really Kafka after is entered the `entrance' in the forest? Was one story simply the dream of the respective story's character? <br /> <br />The answers are not important. The `memories' that the reader carries away-memories from the `real' novel, memories from the memories in the novel, memories of reading the novel, and the myriad of blurry tiers that divide such things-are what are most important to Murakami, and us. <br />  <br />

B000002UAR|5.0|How do you begin to describe perfection? You look for a synergy of several different elements, where the whole is greater than the sum of its parts. With this, the Beatles' greatest achievement, we find a combination of the best songwriting, the best sonic texture, a complete lack of pretension (compared to their next album) while at the same time exploring where complete artistic freedom of expression will lead you-- with the help of your mates, various \\"stimulants\\", and a superb producer in George Martin. <br /> <br />An overlooked and underappreciated aspect of this album is the strength of George Harrison's songs: \\"Taxman\\", \\"Love You To\\", and \\"I Want to Tell You\\". He had help from John and Paul with some of the words to \\"Taxman\\", and Paul contributed that incredible guitar solo and thumping bass line. \\"Love You To\\" (to what?) is all Indian musicians George had befriended, and there are some wonderful little touches on \\"I Want to Tell You\\", such as that little dissonant piano part and the great fade-in on that circular guitar riff. The sonic quality is unparalleled and beautifully recorded. <br /> <br />\\"Yellow Submarine\\" has a simple structure of course, but the snippets of \\"ship sounds\\" and Paul's wonderful echoing on the final verse give the song greater complexity, not to mention that the words of the song itself are quite impressionistic even in their simplicity. Finally, there is a harmony during the chorus on the word 'submarine' where the middle syllable goes down and goes down again on the final syllable of the final 'submarine'. Little things like this are the sonic equivalent of looking at the brushstokes of Rembrandt. They go almost unnoticed but add something ineffable even to the album's most \\"throwaway\\" song. <br /> <br />The remaining 10 songs are equally divided between John and Paul. These are the best five songs Paul ever had together on one album. Are there better songs that he wrote before and after? Perhaps, but on no other album does he have as many great songs all together. \\"Eleanor Rigby\\" and \\"For No One\\" are poignant and serious, which we never quite heard often enough from him. Interesting that he employed a string quartet for one and makes the second a piano-centered piece. It is as though he needs to move away from guitar/bass to be a more serious composer.  <br /> <br />\\"Good Day Sunshine\\" and \\"Got to Get You Into My Life\\" form another natural pair and are songs that are sunny (the horn charts create this mood) and romantic without being cloying. The lyrics are superb and the arrangements are utterly sympathetic. <br /> <br />\\"Here, There, and Everywhere\\" is as perfect a romantic pop song as has ever been written, and might well have inspired George to write \\"Something\\" a few years later. The harmonies are tight, creating a lush aural texture that mimics the hazy eroticism we experience when we fall in love. Probably Paul's best song, along with \\"Hey Jude\\". <br /> <br />Finally we come to John's contributions. His five songs are not collectively his best, but in terms of his willingness to experiment with sonic textures, they are The Beatles' best and actually leave the most lasting impression over the decades. The sneering \\"Doctor Robert\\" is the weakest of the five, but has a catchy melody and is expertly woven into the sonic fabric of the rest of his songs on the album. \\"I'm Only Sleeping\\" showcases a sound and vocal quality that is very evocative of that dreamy \\"I'm calling in sick today\\" deliciousness. <br /> <br />Even though John hated the words to \\"And Your Bird Can Sing\\" it is the dual guitar lines, the strong harmonies, and the melody which make the song great in spite of John's misgivings.   <br /> <br />But the two songs that cement John's place on this album (and which closed each side of the LP) are \\"She Said She Said\\" and  \\"Tomorrow Never Knows\\". They are serious explorations sonically and psychically, mesmerizing and undoubtedly enormously influential. With help from Ringo on thelatter and once again great guitars on the former, we have reached perfection. <br /> <br />This, friends, is the apotheosis of The Beatles' recording career, and the greatest recording in the rock and pop genres, while transcending both because it is also a great work of art.
B0001EFTTM|5.0|Nosferatu was a well made slient film of a vampire named Count Orlock. I loved every minute of it. Orlock has the scariest face and fingers. It was so well made but then in 2002 or so they took this movie and put gothic music for it which wasnt so bad either. Knowing that this was a gothic movie back in the day. I love this movie, it would be my all time fav vampire movie ever.
B0002858YS|5.0|After hearing \\"Somebody Told Me\\" it took me a while to buy this CD, because it did not sound that great from the 30 second samples. However, when I listened to a few full tracks, and once I bought the CD, I realized the 30 second samples do not to this album any justice. This is one of my favorite albums. The Killers are an extremely talented group that stand out in the music world. The CD offers a variety of sounds from the group, and each song is enjoyable in its own way. Each song seems to end in a great way, even if the beginning is a bit slow. The songs are catchy and great for listening anywhere. My personal favorite that has not gotten airtime is track 8, Change Your Mind. It has a great sound that is different from a number of the other songs, and it shows the versatility of the group. This is a must buy, especially because of its low price.

Punks dont sing pop music like many other punk bands like Good Chalotte,Simple Plan,Avril...no thats not even close to punk.<br /><br />3.Piercings and Tattoos doesnt mean your punk at.<br /><br />4.Punks yell and do crazy things. Punk bands---Sex Pistols,Ramones,Clash,Distillers,Misfits,Dead Kennedys,Bad Religon,New York Dolls,Dammed...Watch videos of them or something watch how they act and complare them to newer punks...Dont call older punks \\"posers\\" cause they made it.<br /><br />6. Mowaks dont make you punk.<br /><br />7. Punk songs dont have meanings there just about random things not about how you love someone or how you miss them or even about someone trying to have sex with you then leaves.<br /><br />Think about it, I am not being mean I am just speaking my mind about real punks...Blink 182 is pop punk.
B00097A5HW|5.0|Since her third album \\"Pies Delcalzos\\" i've been a true follower from her music, she have this powerful voice combined with her deep and lovely lyrics. When i heard the single \\"La tortura\\" i said to myself \\"this a great sound! it's powerful, it's catchy, it's tropical sound but at the same time is rock!!!\\" and as always i was expecting a great CD from Shakira, but now when i have the oportunity of listen the whole album i will assure to everybody that this is probably her best album to the date. Song by song this album takes you from sadly-deep melodies to energetic fun songs... Its an adventure through a lot of new and old rythms. <br /> <br />\\"La pared\\"... wow... this song!... both vesions are plain perfect, its hard to choose one, the background of the electronic version reminds me in some parts to the electrosound of new order and depeche mode but the one with the piano is just marvelous, its a deep-felt version of the song. She tried to explore a lot of rythms in this album, \\"Obtener un si\\" have a relaxing bossa-nova sound, \\"Dia de Enero\\" reminds me a great spanish band from the nineties named Cristina y Los Subterraneos, she have a very sweet-tone voice in this romantic song. Another song that caught my attention is \\"Escondite Ingles\\", about the popular kids game \\"Hide and Seek\\", a very catchy and fun song probably influenced by Blondie or the roots of No Doubt. Two songs she decided to share the credits with co-producer of the album and probably one of the biggest latin rock star Gustavo Cerati, vocalist of Soda Stereo... \\"No\\" is a slow rock song with Gustavo backing the chorus and in charge of the Guitar and \\"Dia Especial\\" is more a pop song with a very marked Cerati-Soda style. The other three songs are good and have a lot from her \\"Pies Descalzos\\" and \\"Donde estan los ladrones\\" albums. <br /> <br />This is a fresh new album with a shakira already recognized worldwide for her supercommercial album \\"Laundry service\\" and trying to bet on her music and not thepublicity. <br />

Hes not even really taleneted I saw them on MTV once cause I was living with this family for a while and her son's watch MTV alot and were watching Maroon 5, I thought to myself no talent at all. Bands shouldnt be about pretty boys singing about their ex-girlfriends, or make a video about going out with a girls mom. I am sorry but Maroon 5 is garbage to my ears.
B00097DX3U|1.0|I cannot possibly express how terribly dissapointed I am at this album.  Being a huge Soundgarden fan (I could take or leave RATM), I was hesitant to embrace Audioslave back in 2001; however, their debut album quickly won me over, as I found myself thoroughly enjoying their work.  With time, their debut album actually got better, and all was right with rock.  Then, with the release of Out of Exile, my excitement for these talented musicians quickly wanned.  I admit, I was expecting to receive a great rock album, so my expectations initially tainted me, but with each subsequent listen, the album just got worse. <br /> <br />Unlike their first album, Out of Exile had no form or style.  Their songs range from unbearable metal ballads, to average folk-style songs, to eerie Tool-esque depth, back to soft rock nonsense.  Additionally, because of the atrocious quality of their songs, their ability as muscicians was undermined:  Chris Cornell's vocals were subdued and Brad's drumming could easily be replicated using a cheesy music generator.  In other words, their songs are so poorly contructed that their talent has been completely washed out. <br /> <br />As a die-hard Soundgarden fan, it brings tears to my eyes to see Chris Cornell producing this kind of acoustic nonsense, but I say this will all sincerity:  please stop!
B0001RVTXO|5.0|Pixies would have to be one of the best indie bands out there. With songs such as \\"Monkey Gone To Heaven\\", and \\"Bone Machine\\" its hard not to like The Pixes. Even though they went their own way and started newer bands, The Pixes will always be my favorite Indie Band.

Everyone sees him as this devil but when you set down and read his book or interviews you think different of them. His lyrics are genius. No one gives him a chance cause of the way he looks. But when you think about it, hes doing what he wants to do, and you should respect him no matter how ugly he is, hes actully a pretty cool guy. You just have to get to know him and this book will help you learn about him. Not all rock stars are people who wear makeup and try to get you to hate them no its nothing like that. Marilyan Manson is one of them that people just look at and think OMG HES STUPID OR OMG WHY DOES HE LOOK LIKE THAT...HE WORSHIPS THE DEVIL HES A GOTH!!..Manson is not a goth..He never clamined to be a goth hes more like Rock or Industral Gothic...Hes not even close to goth, and you should atleast give him a chance unstead of just juding all these bands you dont even know...or give a chance to...Manson is a great songwriter, and not a bad singer. So why dont you just stop judging him and maybe read his book and actully get to know the real manson. Just like you and me hes a human beining.

I am proud to say i own all the pumpkins even aeroplane and machina II and i'd have to say this is as close to home as you can get. Billy has a great talent in making lighter music and thats for sure, this is noticably lighter than MCIS or SD but its for the best in my opinion. I think this is their most talented album. The standout tracks are Pug, Appels + Oranjes, and For Martha. Pug is a really cool song. There is no really bad track on this album, its unique and outstanding I am going on the billy corgan world tour next month and im sure wxcited well gotta go  ~~~~ Ta

Knocking on Heavens Door, Lonesome death of Hattie Carol and Like a Rolling Stone were some of his greastest songs...If you like genius music Bob Dylan is one of the guys you should listen to.

Later on they both find types for them and learn that the Dr. has to kill Adam.

Only one survior can tell the story of what happens. The ending threw many people away though. The dead man was the Jigsaw Killer. Its a movie to get cruddeling with your sweetie if you get scared of horror movies quickly.
0142000663|5.0|If you are looking for slick plots, witty humour, or fast paced action, don't bother looking here.  Steinbeck trancends society's 2 minute attention span to deliver a work so thought provoking, so fundamentally touching and heart-wrenching, that the reader cannot help but ponder its effect long after having put it down.<br /><br />The novel follows the dust bowl migration of the Great Depression, alternating between the desolate struggle of a migrant family - the Joads - and more broad depictions of a people forced to the threshold of human tolerance and survival.<br /><br />The language is especially brilliant.  As one less than ecstatic reviewer exclaimed,\\"this book was about dirt, poor people and dirt.\\"  Exactly, and one could not craft a more beautiful picture out of such material.  The imagery is wonderfully crafted to perpetuate exactly what Steinbeck wanted: gloom, anger, and a paradoxical will to keep faith and move on.<br /><br />\\"Our people are good people; our people are kind people.  Pray God some day kind people won't all be poor.  Pray God some day a kid can eat.  And assosiations of owners knew that some day the praying would stop.  And there's the end.\\"

But Keane would have to be one of the best sofest bands out there in the newer days.
B0002OERI0|1.0|This is not Green Day. The first ever rock song I heard was Basket Case. Green Day used to write songs that had the weirdst meanings. They wrote a song about what to do after masterbating. Some songs on this album feel like the theres some old Green Day trying to escape. This is Pop-Punk. Green Day goes right next to Simple Plan and Good Charlotte now. If you are an fan of Green Day and enjoy there old music dont buy this album. If you are fan of Pop-Punk bands then this album is for you.

B00005QFE5|5.0|\\"The Road Home\\" was a rewarding viewing experience.  Zhang Yimou whose \\"Hero\\" & \\"House of Flying Daggers\\" were action-packed tragedies does a masterful job with this more reflective romantic tale.  As is the hallmark of his work, the visuals are stunning from the use of the red jacket to the red hairpin.  Splitting the film into two sections, the present in black & white and the past in color, works as a way of telling two parts of the same story.  Sun Honglei does a nice job as the son who returns to take care of his mother.  As the aging mother, Zhao Yuelin has believable amounts of grief and stubbornness.  However, without a doubt, this is Zhang Ziyi's movie.  If ever there were a Chinese actress likely to garner an Oscar nomination, she'd be the one to watch over the next decade.  The nuances of her performance are phenomenal from the shy flirting glances with the schoolteacher to her panic as she runs with a bowl of dumplings.  This film won both the Silver Bear Award @ the Berlin film festival in 2000 & the Sundance World Cinema Award in 2001.  While the pace is slow, the story is sure and grips the audience every step of the way.  Bravo!

Josh Groban is an amazing talent, and his voice send chills. Seldom can you say that about an artist these days, but you guys know what I am talking about. I ADORE Tom Hanks' Hot Chocolate song. It is a lot of fun!! The kids were singing, I was singing, and as a family we had a great time! On the holiday spirit scale, I would have to say we were pushing 110%!! Visions of a crisp winter night baking holiday sugar cookies with the kiddies, and sipping steaming cocoa by a cozy fire are just a few of the memories that the music on this soundtrack brings to mind.

He is perfect for his \\"roles\\", and watching this movie, you can really feel that he is a dad too...that he bore that in mind when making the decision to make the film, and during his performances in this film (albeit animated (CG'D) performances). There are some thrilling edge-of-your seat moments that some smaller viewers may find a little too tense, but it is like I say, THRILLING! I am down-right giddy with regard to this movie's arrival on DVD. Josh Groban's voice is spectacular on the soundtrack, which is also worth parting with a few of your hard-earned dollars in order to own and enjoy for Christmases to come! Don't leave this dvd on the shelf when it comes out. You'll want it at your fingertips whenever you are in the mood for a holiday classic!
B000002KIE|5.0|England had some good bands like The Cure,Dreadful Shadows,Sex Pistols, Stone Roses. Sex Pistols is the type of band you dont want to bring home to meet the parents. Johnny Rotten with his angry voice and Sid Vicious with his guitar skills together made the band popular. Later on they changed England forever, so many people looked up to the Sex Pistols. Soon alter God Save the Queen became the Anthem in England all around. Even though they were banned in 78, they are still a great band to this day.
0312995423|3.0|Maybe I have really low expectations of Mass-Market Paperback Adventures.  I didn't expect a stellar piece of work or anything comparable to Angels and Demon's or the Da Vinci Code.  Yet this book still offered a mind-numbing, quick adventure to pass the time.  I doubt that I will ever read this book again but it was interesting while it lasted.  The storyline wasn't all that developed and unfortunately the author chose to go overboard on plot twists rather then develop his characters at length.  If you are looking for something to read to pass the time this book is great.  If you are looking for something more intellectually stimulating you might want to pass on this book.

B000001ESN|5.0|What a fantastic CD! The picture alone sold me. This is, by far, RUSH's masterpiece of the 80's. I personally prefer this CD to MOVING PICTURES.  <br /> Why, you ask? Because of it's musical, and lyrical content. Brilliant in every fashion. I find myself listening to this CD when I am relaxing after work, or when I just need a good RUSH. <br /> I highly recommend it to anyone just discovering RUSH, and those of us who have been fans forever.

1594200440|5.0|I highly recommend this delightful, fast-reading novel, which should appeal to just about any reader.  There are already several excellent reviews posted for this wonderful novel.  So I needn't go into detail of the story.  In a nutshell, it's about two sisters, Nadia and Vera, Ukrainian immigrants who have not spoken to eachother in years.  They are compelled to join forces when their doddering widowed dad introduces his soon-to-be, mail-order bride from the Old Country.  Valentina is clearly a gold-digger of the worst sort, a wanton wench with a fantastic (but fake) bosum and an obsession for the good (that is, Western) life.  All Nikolai wants is a trophy wife for his old age, and to finish his masterpiece, a treatise about tractors and their significance to civilization.  Protecting their papa and vanquishing Valentina proves quite a challenge for the sisters.  And quite entertaining for the reader lucky enough to find this gem of a novel!  Apart from the humorous conflict, the author gives us an authentic and very affectionate glimpse into the lives of Ukrainian immigrants.  And a compassionate account of the joys of caring for an aged parent.  Don't miss \\"A Short History of the Tractor in Ukrainian.\\"
B00097A5I6|5.0|STELLAR! That is the first word that comes to mind after hearing \\"Don't Believe The Truth\\" for the first time. I am blown away by this album! It is definitely right up there with (What's The Story) Morning Glory and Definitely Maybe. Oasis is back and better than ever. They are selling out places like Madison Square Garden in the USA and generating lots of positive reviews etc. If you loved them in 94/95 you're going to really love them now! Buy this album ASAP !!!!! <br /> <br />

B00080Z53O|4.0|\\"The Sea Inside\\" is the true story of Ram&oacute;n Sampedro, a quadriplegic whose petition for the right to kill himself brought his cause to the public eye in Spain in the 1990s. When the movie opens, Ram&oacute;n (Javier Bardem) has been paralyzed from the neck down for 26 years, the victim of a diving accident in 1968. He lives in his bed, in his brother's home, surrounded by books, music, and one window, taken care of by his sister-in-law Manuela (Mabel Rivera). Ram&oacute;n writes poetry and receives visitors, but wants to die, as he finds life without dignity intolerable and real life \\"a false hope, a dream\\". With the help of Gen&eacute; (Clara Segura), a tireless woman who works for a right-to-die organization, and a lawyer, Julia (Bel&eacute;n Rueda), whose own degenerative neurological disease makes her sympathetic to his cause, Ram&oacute;n takes his petition for assisted suicide to court.<br /><br />The events of the film take place over about 2 years, during which we see Ram&oacute;n's spirited personality and his helplessness, as well as the impact of his condition on his family. We travel through his imagination and back to his accident. Ram&oacute;n publishes a book of poetry, while he wages a media campaign to garner support for his petition. The story we see in this film is partially fictionalized. Julia is  a composite of several women, and Ram&oacute;n's nephew Javier is a composite of his numerous nephews and nieces. Gen&eacute; is a real person, but she was not pregnant during the events of the film. The scene is which Ram&oacute;n is visited by a priest combines a couple of different incidents with dialogue taken from published debates. The basic true storyline has been preserved, but more license has been taken for thematic and dramatic purposes than I usually find in a biopic.<br /><br />\\"The Sea Inside\\"'s great strengths are Javier Bardem's performance and the way in which director Alejandro Amen&aacute;bar is able to visually link Ram&oacute;n's real life to his imagination. As you might expect, the man often lived in his dreams. Bardem is convincing as a man 20 years older than himself -with the aid of good makeup. And his lively, charismatic, but sad performance seem to perfectly convey the real Ram&oacute;n's personality, as far as I can tell from film clips that I've seen of the real man. The actors who portray Ram&oacute;n's family all give fine performances, but Mabel Rivera's reserved interpretation is especially impressive. \\"The Sea Inside\\" is a little too neatly contrived in places and too melodramatic in others, which I felt were weaknesses. To some degree, this was intentional, as director Amen&aacute;bar wanted to incorporate the melodramatic and humorous aspects of Ram&oacute;n's personality into the film. \\"The Sea Inside\\" won nearly 40 cinema awards worldwide in 2005. It swept Spain's Goya Awards and took the Academy Award for Best Foreign Film. It wasn't the best foreign film of 2005, but it's a thoughtful portrait of Ram&oacute;n Sampedro and his family with an outstanding performance by Javier Bardem.<br /><br />The DVD (New Line 2005 release): Bonus features include a making-of documentary, an audio commentary, 3 galleries, 3 deleted or alternate scenes, and a DVD-ROM (Windows only). \\"A Trip to The Sea Inside\\" (1 hour, 25 minutes) is a way-too-long documentary that traces the making of this film from writing the script, through pre-production, casting, planning, filming, and post-production. There are interviews with cast, crew, and writers, but the most prominently featured interview subjects are director Alejandro Amen&aacute;bar and producer Fernando Bovaira. I found the information about Javier Bardem preparing for his role the most interesting, but this documentary needed to be edited down to half its length. The \\"Photo Gallery\\" contains Ram&oacute;n's photos from the movie and some on-set stills. The \\"Storyboard Gallery\\" is 32 black-and-white drawings for the scene of Ram&oacute;n's accident. The \\"Set Design Gallery\\" contains 17 color drawings. There is a good audio commentary by Alejandro Amen&aacute;bar that is more informative than the documentary. Amen&aacute;bar discusses creative and narrative decisions, casting, characters, themes, and the presence of death in his films. The commentary is in Spanish with subtitles. Subtitles are available for the film in English and Spanish.ormative than the documentary.

B00005MAM2|3.0|Akira is one of, if not the best (besides Twilight of The Dark Master) japanamation of all time. Or at least since Ive been watching them for more than ten years. Ive had it on VHS forever and have watched it frequently until I bought this special edition DVD. Don't get me wrong with the three stars, I love this movie. What bothers me is the characters voices have changed AND the dialoge is different. Not to the point to where the story plot has changed but noticably. I have noticed now that it says in plain english \\"new english dialogue\\" on the features on the back of the DVD, and if I had noticed that beforehand I wouldn't have bought it. Or who am I kidding; It's Akira, yes I would have just to have the special edition. But I must tell you that when I feel like watching Akira, I pop in the VHS with the original voices and dialogue. The DVD, most likely, will forever sit on my shelf. I just hope I can find the original on DVD. So far everyone I have looked at says \\"new english dialogue\\".
B00003CX5P|3.0|This had the potential to be soooo good, and yet, for many loyal fans, it was a letdown.  I remember hearing that they were going to make prequels, and being so excited.  Having been born far too late the see the original theatrical releases of the original triogy, I had to be content with seeing the Special Editions.  When I saw this movie I was 9, so I thought it was really great.  However, now I realize that there were serious problems with this movie.  First, Amidala- she had great style, but compared to  Princess Leia, she was a wimp.  None of the characters from the original seemed to be the same, and some of the new ones were not quite up to par: Jar-Jar- what was up with him? Did we really need him there? Plus,  Anakin struck me as way too innocent for a 9-year-old boy growing up in one of Tatooine's spaceports.  None of the story seemed to have a point, except to have Anakin meet his future wife.  However, there were some good things about it.  First, the special effects were excellent.  Not quite as good as in later Star Wars movies, but excellent.  Second, Darth Maul.  He was the only new addition that seemed worthy of being called Star Wars.  He was nowhere near as good as Darth Vader, but that was because he didn't try to be.  He was his own villian, and it woked perfectly.  I've never seen anyone use a lightsaber like that before, like it was part of him, not just a weapon.  Episode I's lightsaber fight is arguably the best one in all 6 movies.  Other than that, it's not really worth it.  1 star for Darth Maul and the lightsaber fight, one for the special effects, and one simply because it's Star Wars, not that it's worthy of the name
B00005T30L|1.0|There are a great deal of things that I have done which I should have been punished for.  And this movie is the perfect punishment.  Which seems odd, as the characters were likable. The acting wasn't terrible.  In fact, things were in place to make a moving teen movie.  Though the characters remain interesting throughout the movie, they don't really seem to have a plot to carry.    <br />    Many could dismiss this movie as merely a teen angst-type film, but this goes much lower, much worse than almost all.  Unlike others, with their cliched themes, this doesn't seem to have much of a theme, and at that it's hollow.  The characters seem to blend into a patchwork of nothingness, where actions and consequences don't relate and ends in frayed tatters of what could have been.  If you only cared.   <br />
6301773551|4.0|This is where it all began...it's the original movie; the one that started it all.  In 1977, a movie like this had never been seen.  It's become beyond a classic...just part of American popular culture.  However, it's not the best of the bunch.  It starts things off well, and introduced us to some very beloved characters- Han Solo, Chewbacca, R2-D2, C-3PO, Luke, Leia, and of course, Darth Vader; who is probably the first villian that people cared about as much as the heroes.  It also  introduces us to Obi-Wan Kenobi, Luke's mentor, and master.  However, there are a few crucial elements missing.  For instance, there is no extremely exciting lightsaber fight, just the warm-up between obi-Wan and Darth Vader, which does tie up the prequel series nicely.  Second, what's with Governor Ttarkin?  He bothered me A LOT.  He ordered Darth Vader around like he was in charge.  Why would Darth Vader, the guy who strangles people without any sign of remorse, take orders from this guy? All in all, it's not the best movie ever, but it does set the stage for The Empire Strikes Back, the best out of all of them.
B00097DX3U|4.0|This album is everything their debut should've been. The first album lacked a united sound, where it felt more of a mixture of Chris Cornell lending his voice and lyrics to RATM instrumentals. Out of Exile, however, puts Audioslave under a single banner and the results are truly fantastic. Cornell's vocals are back up to par with Sweet Euphoria and his Soundgarden days. Cornell's range is widened for the sophmore album, and the increase is greatly appreciated. Did I mention the band actually sounds like ONE band on Out of Exile yet? Wilk's, Morello's, and Commerford's instrumentals reflect the raw emotion of Cornell's lyrics and vocals almost perfectly. There are rare occassions when vocals and instrumental do not mix together very well, but they are kept to a minimum and bearable. On their self-titled debut album, I felt Audioslave was lacking with Morello's guitar compositions. With Out of Exile, however, Morello's guitar playing picks back up from Battle of Los Angeles. Morello plays with more difficulty and his originality is back in action. Some may find parts of his guitar lines cumbersome and bring down the value of song, however, I disagree completely. Morello lacked complex guitar lines in the debut album and he finally gets back into stride. The strong points from their debut album are still there; Wilk on drums and Tim on bass. There are two or three \\"Deja Vu\\" moments which liken to Soundgarden's Down On The Upside album, however, the band still stays together in these songs, never straying from eachother. Out of Exile will be marked as the album Audioslave found their identity, and I hope this identity is out for many years to come.
0393317552|5.0|This book dropped into my lap at exactly the right time and place, and it inspired in me a fascination for global history that has remained with me ever since.<br /><br />Prior to reading this brilliant book, I knew that I was supposed to believe that the hugely varying positions of different peoples in the world was nothing to do with race and genetics. But for all I knew, this was just the result of modern PC ideology, and I had yet to encounter convincing arguments supporting this view.<br /><br />Diamond's book was epic, and I will never forget it. Certainly, I can now see why a continent such as Australia - where to this day only the cashew nut has been successfully cultivated or domesticated of all its flora and fauna - provided little opportunity for Australian aborigines to embark on an era of dramatic population increase, technological achievement, and advanced civilisation. The point is fairly simple and obvious at heart: Give one group of people little and another group plenty, and - unless there is some way for those with little to take from those with plenty (as has happened frequently) - you can fairly much expect that those with plenty will move ahead.<br /><br />In 'Guns, Germs, and Steel' this logical truth is explained so thoroughly and convincingly that upon finishing this compulsive read I felt myself to be quite comfortable on the subject. It is one of those reads from which you learn an incredible amount and yet retain an incredible amount also. I cannot say enough for this book. I have known it to satisfy both laymen and academics alike and I recommend it to all.
B00005T30L|3.0|I had high expectations for this movie, which the critics generally loved, and ended up very disappointed. The two lead characters are both very interesting, quirky and off-beat, and I concur with the accolades they have received. However, they were really let down by the screenplay. The story is just not very developed, and we are just left with two characters in search of a story worthy of their quirkiness. On top of that, the other main characters are basically all clichs, especially the art teacher. This is not necessarily their fault, but the screenwriter's. This is a marginal movie as far as whether you should spend your time with it. I was waiting for something interesting to make the investment of time worthwhile and it just didn't happen.
B00097A5I6|5.0|Don't Believe The Truth is the sixth Oasis studio album-and a very proud success for this group! You get the awesome hit single \\"Lyla\\" as well as \\"Let There Be Love.\\" It appears they saved \\"Let There Be Love\\" as almost the best for last since this is one of the most beautiful songs I personally have ever heard! No longer is Oasis stumbling though setbacks and comebacks-I get the strong sense that they have permanently emerged strong and very memorable with this CD being the proof of it. You still get that classic British guitar pop rock flavor running distinctly throughout. Yet with this CD Oasis finally gives us the strong lyrics consistently throughout the album and the musical arrangements are both instantly and all at once both free and secure-a very tough feat to accomplish! Simply put: Oasis is back on top!<br /><br />The CD starts off running strong and hard with the opening track \\"Turn Up The Sun.\\" There is a beautiful and thoughtful musical intro to this track-love those lyrics! And how's about that guitar on \\"Mucky Fingers?\\" AWESOME! In \\"Love Like A Bomb\\" you hear of a man's love for his woman; it's very memorable. \\"Guess God Thinks I'm Abel\\" is practically instantly memorable; and \\"A Bell Will Ring\\" has great lyrics.<br /><br />And that song, \\"Lyla.\\" The guitar and the vocals blend flawlessly on \\"Lyla\\" and this is without doubt a great song. \\"Lyla,\\" as some of you may already know, is destined to be a long lasting hit song. It is well crafted, well arranged, and very well performed here by Oasis. In fact, the total sum of every song on this CD proves Oasis is rejuvenated and very much a strong force on the music scene.<br /><br />A special note once again on that last track, \\"Let There Be Love.\\" This song is destined to have a strong impact on the majority of people listening to it and reading this review. I think in some ways the album is worth it just for this one song! The song is remarkably inspirational; it begins with the gripping and oh so sensitive words \\"Who kicked a whole in the sky so that heaven could cry over me?\\" As you listen to the song, especially more than once, don't be surprised if you find yourself reaching for the phone to make up with that old friend who stopped talking to long ago; to go back to school to get that degree; or to follow whatever your dreams may be.<br /><br />All in all, Noel and Liam are producing and singing some awesome, very fine music on this CD of theirs. They are amply aided by their peers. Zak Starkey, Ringo Starr's son, and Terry Kirkbride play drums; Lenny Castro plays percussion. Also look for Gem Archer on guitar with Andy Bell on bass guitar. This CD is an absolute must for Oasis fans who want the joy of knowing the group is very far from any setbacks! British pop fans as well as fans in general of rock and pop will be awestruck by this album.

B00003CXCT|4.0|I am a Teen of this Generation,16 y/o as of 2005. The First Star Wars I saw was \\"The Phantom Menace\\" in '99 good Movie, then I saw \\"Attack of the Clones\\", a bit dissapointing. But \\"A New Hope\\",\\"Empire Strikes Back\\"(my favorite), and \\"Return of the Jedi\\", are all masterpieces, primitive effects or brand new CGI. I have the '97 Versions which I purchased in 2002, the effects are decent. But I really paid more attention to the story despite the effects can't hold a candle to the effects of \\"Phantom Menace\\" and \\"Attack of the Clones\\". Now Revisited, the 2004 DVD Trilogy is a major step forward from the '97 version and a jump from the 1977,1980 and 1983. I was fortunate to see the \\"Original\\" Versions(THANKS DAD) which you purists call it. <br />Many of these Changes recieve a thumbs up from me, I will explain why: <br /> <br />PROS <br />EP.IV \\"A NEW HOPE\\" <br />In \\"A new Hope\\" color is greatly improved and much of the CGI is a good thing. A couple of examples are the Sandcrawler, looks way better and has a perspective. Jabba the Hutt is changed from the Human actor in '77,to the Gruesome PS2 reject '97 Jabba, to the better,not perfect, better Ep.VI and Ep.I Jabba, but he is kinda dark in this movie. Shots Like X-Wings leaving Yavin and the Detail added to X and Y wings in outer space preparing to attack the death star.The Death Star and Alderaan explosions are stronger with an added aftershock and Added Scenes at Mos Eisley add a little more Humor to the Movie for the Kiddies. Audio changes like the Soundtrack are a big improvement, awesome on a THX system, Luke's \\"I think we took a wrong turn\\" Echo is also more believable, in '77 it sounded kinda exaggerated. <br /> <br />EP. V <br />My Favorite of the Originals.With THX in the backpocket, The Battle of Hoth is much more breathtaking, with explosions of AT-AT's and the Asteroid field.One of the Best changes is adding Ian McDiarmid as the Emperor rather than the Monkey woman voiced by Clive Revell on the '80 and '97 versions. Lucas did not change it for the Prequels In my opinion, he changed it to fit Ep.VI. The Slave I chasing the Millenium Falcon is way better also. Cloud city's color has been enhanced, it is necessary to fit our now digital world. One change that took a while to realize is there's windows in the building where the group is with Lando. A Huge audio change is the conversation w/ the emperor and Darth Vader, also Luke fall w/ digninty rather than the crappy scream in '97.  <br /> <br />EP.VI <br />ROTJ is the lesser of the Older movies, only 1/4 as good as Ep.IV, and 1/2 as good as EP.V, but 100x better than Ep.II. Jabba's Sail barge colour looks better,of course and the Sarlacc has an added mouth, both are good changes. Han Solo's toes must have been super strong in '83, that was hard to believe, an added CGI Ropes take care of the Hercules toes w/ added detail. Darth Vaders eyebrows are removed, which makes sense since he was horribly burned in Ep.III. Death Star II's explosion has been enhanced, also the celebration added Naboo and Coruscant and an Added Jar Jar screaming \\"WESA FREE!!!\\". Hadyen Christensen's cameo is a good change in my opinion, because he died as a young adult when he turned to the dark side but then turned good again which when he was good he was a young adult, so it's a good thing. There's also a toppled statue of Palpatine that isn't there in '83. <br /> <br />Now the Cons. <br />EP.IV <br />The audio is kinda choppy, an example is when Luke sounds like he's in '77 old analog and Leia sounds like a digital '04. <br />Jabba the Hutt still doesn't look like the '83 Jabba or the '99 Ep.I Jabba. The Lightsaber going from on to off and vice versa. Could have been fixed. <br /> <br />EP.V <br />Boba's Voice, in some cases, the Ep.II outpreforms the Original voice, but not quite, there is more feeling in the original voice of Boba, but It makes sense to alter it since he is a clone of Jango. I really don't like how Vader's Lightsaber looks, it ispink, George... IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE RED!!. <br /> <br />EP.VI <br />The Music at Jabba's place is just bad...I prefer the '83 Version.And the biggest con is Vader's Lightsaber...again...IT'S PINK!!!. The Last isn't really a con for me but for some it is big and it's not Anakin. Jar Jar is added at the Celebration Saying \\"WESA FREE!!!\\", i'm the few people that didn't hate Jar Jar but for some, it's gonna hurt. <br /> <br />The Story for all movies EP.I to EP.VI is all great, some are just explained better that others, all except Ep.II. THX comes a long way on enhancing the Experience of these great movies, The oldest, IV, is experience in a new way with great additions and better overall feel of movies. Star Wars isn't about remaining pure all the time, The Old movies tell a story and so do the New ones, \\"Boo\\" say the \\"Original Purists\\" who are nostalgic. But Lucas is giving more to my generation on experiencing the Old movies, but in a new way. I for one congratulate Mr.Lucas on this changes, I'm Happy for him because he gets to sjow the movies he originally intended, but because of the age he made them and the budget, he often hit a wall and had to settle for less, Not any more. Some CGI changes are good, some are bad, same w/ audio and scenes. <br /> <br />Oh... and one thing... There His Movies, not yours, so stop whining and if you didn't like the '97 edition, then don't bother looking at this one or you will have experience a rage like never before, but for the rest of us who appreciate,old generation of the '77,'80, and '83 and this new '04 versions equally, Buy this DVD, you will not regret your decision, I appreciate it old or new, and for that I consider myself a true fan of Star Wars.
B0007YMUZW|5.0|After the Rock'n'Roll album, it may have seemed like Ryan Adams was going to be his generation's Paul Westerberg. He'd certainly made a record to lay claim to the title, and had a celebrity feud with Westerberg to boot. But as I listen to and absorb the exquisite Cold Roses, I think I finally have him sussed. I think he's going to be his generation's Neil Young. And frankly, a fella could do a lot worse.<br /><br />I think when Ryan Adams is 60, people will look back at his catalog, and it will be meandering, inconsistent, spotty, unpredictable... and jaw droppingly spectacular. There will be unpopular work-- hell, there might even be an album as ill-conceived as Young's Everybody's Rockin' (or as I called it, Everybody's Whinin'). But there will be five, ten, more albums as transcendent as D&eacute;j&agrave; Vu, Everybody Knows This is Nowhere, On the Beach, Zuma, Harvest, Tonight's the Night, Ragged Glory. As far as I'm concerned he's got at least three already-- Heartbreaker, the incandescent and classic Gold, and now Cold Roses.<br /><br />In 2003 I saw Neil Young with his band Crazy Horse, at the age of 58, play an entire concert comprised exclusively of his latest album, which at the time many in the crowd had never heard (indeed it wasn't even out yet.) People were ticked off; someone called out for \\"Cinnamon Girl,\\" and Young deadpanned, \\"Sorry, we don't know that one.\\" He did blast off about five chestnuts in his encore. And by the way, the concert was great; the following spring I saw him do it again, but the album was out, people knew the songs, and suddenly everyone loved him again.<br /><br />I'm listening to a recording of Adams right now from May 12 of this year, and the fans are calling for songs they know. But Adams, stubbornly and with grace, is sticking to his guns, filling the set with new and unfamiliar material from Cold Roses. If you don't want the artist to challenge you, if you want it to be easy, then you probably don't want to follow Ryan Adams, because if you expect the last tour, you will be disappointed. But this is what makes him great, and lies at the core of what I think he has in common with Neil Young.<br /><br />The first couple of times through Cold Roses, I heard it as a folksy riff on Gold-- less a reinvention of classic rock, more alt.country (whatever that is). But then I read that the new album-- recorded with his new band the Cardinals-- was his homage to American Beauty-era Grateful Dead; think \\"Uncle John's Band,\\" but more morose. At first I didn't quite believe it... but then I remembered that the last time I saw him live he used the Dead's \\"Wharf Rat\\" as a show piece for his set, playing an extended and heartfelt version. And when you open the gatefold of the CD, there as plain as day is a shadow image of a bear handing a rose to a little girl. The only way this could be a more deliberate reference to Grateful Dead iconography would be if instead of a little girl it was a skull.<br /><br />The album opens with \\"Magnolia Mountain,\\" which Adams says is about an '80s porn star, but which rings and sobs and lilts and sighs like some great forgotten album track by Van Morrison, Neil Young, the Band, even the Mick Taylor-era Stones. Neil Young could have sung this one on Harvest. First you hear Adams softly count the song in; then a single plaintive acoustic guitar, as the song creeps over you. Cindy Cashdollar's pedal steel, and some combination of her and bassist Catherine Popper's backing vocals, lend color and texture, giving the song-- and indeed the whole album-- a warm organic feel. J.P. Bowersock's lead guitar work is tasteful and never flashy, not entirely unlike, say, James Burton.<br /><br />The refrain to \\"Magnolia Mountain\\" goes like this:<br /><br />\\"Lie to me<br />Sing me a song<br />Sing me a song until the morning comes<br />If the morning comes<br />Will you lie to me<br />Hold me down till the morning comes<br />And if the morning comes<br />Will you lie to me<br />Will you take me to your bed will you lay me down<br />Till I'm heavy like the rocks on the riverbed...\\"<br /><br />The trick isn't writing lyrics like that. The trick is pulling them off. And damn if Adams isn't just earnest enough to do it.<br /><br />The songs keep coming, easy as a porch swing, lots of minor chords and strummed guitars. And Cold Roses is a double CD, even though at about 76 minutes it could have all fit on one disc. But instead of giving us a single, overlong song cycle, Adams gives us two beautifully crafted records that each stand alone, or work as a seamless whole. In the CD age, when most albums are too long by 15 minutes, it is a pleasure. And of course, the thing is priced as a single.<br /><br />It would be easy to call this Adams's Harvest-- and to call Heartbreaker his Tonight's the Night, and Gold his Everybody Knows This is Nowhere-- but that isn't fair to him, any more than it was fair to blame Mantle because he wasn't DiMaggio. Where Adams most evokes Young is in the fact that I have absolutely no idea what his next record will sound like, but I do know I'll buy it the day it comes out. I can be pretty sure that it won't sound like this, though, and that the folks who are booing his shows now because they want to hear the old stuff will be equally vexed come autumn when he's on to the next gig and they want to hear Cold Roses. If you always want to hear the last record, you can't help but be disappointed with a creative soul like Adams.<br /><br />It is possible that I am just so besotted with the guy that I cannot be objective, although it might help to know that I was less than keen on Rock'n'Roll when it first came out (but crazy for Love is Hell, which came out the same day, and which was the less publicized but far more essential release.) So hey. Don't take my word for it. Check out the sound clips.<br /><br />My wife, who is oblivious to the music geek world in which I live but who nonetheless has an absolutely golden ear, loved Gold; she said of it in the car one breezy afternoon, \\"It has the sweet familiar ring of every album you loved as a kid.\\" Precisely. So it augers well that she digs this one a whole lot.l you take me to your bed will you lay me down<br />Till I'm heavy like the rocks on the riverbed...\\"<br /><br />The trick isn't writing lyrics like that.

B0000CDLA7|2.0|I am a big Dream Theater fan. They are my all-time favorite band. I greatly enjoyed this album, but it is definately their worst release so far (too heavy, not outstnding songs). it gets 2- 2 1/2 stars because though it is still a great album, all of their other albums are much, much better; I expected more from them! I hope they go back to Metropolis pt. 2-style for Octavarium.
B0000028VT|5.0|Ah! Here we see Mariah Carey starting to gain attention by singing to us in her sweet voice. Music Box's Singles are still aired on the radio until today. It's amazing to have such a gift that she has. We see her going from a rendition of being a little RnB in \\"Dreamlover\\" to her classic signature ballads like \\"Hero\\", \\"Without You\\" and \\"Never Forget You\\". Amongst them comes her return to gospel as well. A good sample would be \\"Anytime You Need A Friend\\". A Little groving number would be \\"I've Been Thinking About You\\". Her voice seems a little more subtle than her last albums which is nice with not so much \\"screaming\\" like in Emotions. But her voice is one of the view that can sing gospel very nicely until today. Try \\"Fly Like A Bird\\" from her current album \\"The Emancipation of Mimi\\" if you know what I am talking about. Music Box grabs those tad-tired vocals of today and is a testment that Mariah has made a mark with her voice. The album is good overall! It may be slow for you club hitters out there, so beware! If you like slow songs then this is for you. But give it a try you never know. Way To Go MC!!!
B000002JPA|5.0|as far as progressive rock is concerned- THIS album should be at the center of it all- A MUST OWN- also- they scenes from a memory- great, great stuff!!!!
B00000HYXB|5.0|I love this alblum. Absolutely phenomenal.  I listened for this alblum for at least two months straight, every waking hour, and even at the end, I was still not tired of it-I just got more music.  This was my first exposure to neoclassical powermetal, and I have no regrets-I could not have had a better initiation.  While Blind Guardian does not quite feature the multitude of sounds and instruments that comprise the works of Rhapsody, their use of the guitar and vocals are incredible.  Hansi's vocals are astounding in his range, ability to hit the notes and manipulate his tone.  I definitely recommend this alblum to anyone remotely interested in powermetal.  As for the faults present in the alblum, I couldn't really find anything to complain about, so I suppose I'll nitpick: there were a lot of tracks put on the tape to give background to the story, and perhaps some of them could have been left out, but on the other hand, most of them do provide valuable depth and variety.  Also, \\"The Eldar\\" was a little slow and melancholy for my tastes, but it was performed masterfully nonetheless.  \\"Time Stands Still\\" and \\"Mirror Mirror\\" are the two most outstanding pieces on this great alblum, but really they are all great.  Buy this alblum-it is well worth the money
B00097A5I6|4.0|...your words of slander are simply flowing off the duck's back.  Your hatred is expected by now.  Honestly.  The fans know there are those who will rip apart this album no matter how it sounds.  We've heard these lengthy, unimaginative diatribes for going on 11+ years.  Guess what?  Legions of fans and millions of albums later, your close-minded drivel is just old and unoriginal.<br /><br />If you love Oasis, you'll love this album.  If you like Oasis, you'll find at least a few tracks to keep you interested.  If you dislike Oasis, there are plenty of other places to look.  We just don't need to hear about it 5 seconds after you recognize they might have borrowed a chord once found in a previous song.<br /><br />Oasis have never been a band for the critics, but they certainly are a band for the masses.  And there are a few nice flag-waivers on this album.  Give it a listen.
B000063CPL|5.0|Incredible!  Absolutely stunning.  The energy that eminates from Rock in Rio is incredible: The screaming crowds, the scream of the guitar and Bruce's vocal prowess.  If you like Iron Maiden, metal, or just music period, get this.  My first Maiden alblum was this one on advice from a friend, and I am not disappointed.  Some of their songs are actually better live than in studio like \\"2 Minutes to Midnight,\\" but by the same token, some of them suffer.  Take, for instance, \\"The Evil that Men do\\": the song suffers the usual error of live recordings in being out of time, more precisely, sped up.  Not only this, but the sound is somewhat sloppy compared to most of the other songs on the alblum.  Also, Bruce, who is, as another fault, barely audible, fumbles with some lyrics in the second verse.  This is not to say at all, however, that these flaws pose any real argument against Rock in Rio; although I have not heard the volume of Maiden songs the other reviewers may have, I would say that this alblum is at the least eclectic if not something of a greatest hits alblum (yes, I know that they did record one): we have songs all the way from Iron Maiden to Brave New World.  The five songs I find most commendable: \\"The Wickerman,\\" \\"2 Minutes to Midnight,\\" \\"The Mercenary,\\" \\"The Clansman\\" and finally \\"Fear of the Dark.\\"  Although Rock in Rio does lack some of my favorites like \\"Wasted Years\\" and \\"The Flight of Icarus,\\" it is an excellently performed alblum of an amazing hit-list.  An absolute must-buy.
B0000DD7LB|1.0|Don't gey me wrong, I DO like pop and I like Britney Spears but thus CD sucks horribly!!! I used to have the Britney album (until...it got stolen...) and as I really liked that one (that's a cool pop album!!) I decided to get this one, luckily for me, my cousin gave it to me (he's an obsessive Britney fan....and Linkin park too). But except for Me Against the Music, Toxic and Brave New Girl (well...Moby pulled it out well on Early Morning...)I hate this album....maybe you Britney fans or pop fans would differ with this review but I think this sucks as horribly as Blink 182's new album (it's unBlink at its most) also, I don't know hows it on the US but here, it comes with an extra track (besides the remix of Me Against the Music...but don't really remember...Shadow I think its its name...really don't care)so, I really would only recommend this album only to fans or people with a liking for mellow songs. Also, beware little kids because some songs have some sexual content (like Breathe on me....look for the lyrics and you will know why....)
B0002XDODU|5.0|All I can say is buy the cd.  Every track is unique and well done.  To point out just a couple tracks would be pointless.  My personal favorite would be Stein um Stein.  The vocal passion grabs my from the very begining.  This is money well spent.
B00003CXCT|2.0|These movies are definitley not the original movies that we all saw 25 years ago, but if you can live with all the new special effects they are fine. All kids love these movies because they are up to date but they do not even look as good as the original ones. The Jabba and Greedo scenes in A New Hope are pretty bad. I think they should re-release the original films and that would make people much happier. The best thing about this setI think is the bonus DVD.
B0006FFRW0|1.0|NIN is a band I've heard quite a bit about.  I collect rock posters and there are some impressive NIN specimens.  I thougt I should get one of their CD's to see what the story is on these guys.  I should confess, I'm in my mid-40's, so perhaps I'm out of touch with the sensibilities of the youth of America. I'm okay with that.  Everytime I see some idiot with his pants hanging half-way down his ass, wearing a tank-top over his atrophied torso, wild tattoos documenting his life where he has never once left Palookaville, I say to myself: Thank god I grew up in the sixties and seventies when people were genuine and rock bands were larger than life.<br /><br />This so-called music is really a revelation.  I thought rap music was the main garbage out there.  I was wrong, this is the suburban white kid's rap-equivalent and it is very sad stuff.  The creative crescendo is a song where the refrain is \\"I want top f- you like an animal...\\"  Deep stuff!!  Intense!  Insightful!! Profound.  No wonder the NYT recently published an article about the heightened estrogen levels in today's youthful males. This whiney garbage certainly would cause any male's testicles to shrivel into nothingness.<br /><br />No, I'm not going to date myself and suggest an antidote of ample doses of Led Zeppelin, Black Sabbath, Deep Purple, Scorpions, AC/DC, Metallica, Roth-era Van Halen, and Ted Nugent.  Of course, those are indeed vital nutrients which would eradicate your depression and any gynecomastia which haunts you. True, your beard would fill-in and chicks would begin to dig you. No, I realize that today's youngsters desire music from their generation. Okay, let's try Monster Magnet.  Any album, real loud.  If you're an inner-city lad, check out Rage Against the Machine.  Provocative to be sure!  If you insist on the darkness, check out The Haunted.  NIN would be hiding under the bed as you play this heavy gothic death metal that actually entails some real talent. If you're dating a cheerleader, White Stripes actually does rock, is hetero, and doesn't promote suicide or nipple rings.  Try it. If you can take break from the hard-stuff, try Cake. Mellow, but that's okay on occasion.  My point is: there is some new stuff that's very good; but not NIN. The current generation's musicians may not be as prolific as in the past, but with a little research you can locate genuine contemporary icons which will inspire you.<br /><br />My opinion is that NIN is pure garbage.  This is computer-generated malaise-oriented music to hate yourself by and which will turn you into the wussy which will embarass both of your parents (unless your Dad is gay and bi-polar).  Who needs that?  Life is too short to tolerate this kind of synthetic knee-deep garbage.  Remember, there's nothing wrong with you that Ozzie, Ted and Angus can't fix within hours. Get your blood flowing; you'll feel better in no time., White Stripes actually does rock, is hetero, and doesn't promote suicide or nipple rings.  Try it.

B0007DAZW8|4.0|I like a lot what I'm hearing from this CD.  Daft Punk have put plenty of quality in their album \\"Human After All.\\"  Most of the songs on here are awesome.  This is great stuff.  The robots from France have impressed me with their material once again.  This only makes me wanna dress up like one of the Daft Punk members for Halloween.  A costume like that would be wicked cool.      There are ten tracks in all.  But includes only nine songs.  The non-song track is a twenty second long track called \\"On/Off.\\"  It's channel surfing followed by the TV turning off.    Tracks include the song \\"Human After All.\\"  Everything goes great together, the vocals, the percussion, everything!  It sounds very futuristic and I like that.  \\"The Prime Time of Your Life\\" has distorted percussion.  I like that.  There's a part in the song where it goes faster and faster near the end.  \\"Television Rules the Nation\\" is another nice track.  I like the equipment used for the song.  I wanna play this song loud enough so the sound goes all the way through town.  I have the very temptation to do that.  \\"Robot Rock\\" is one of my favorite tunes on the CD.  The only thing this track actually does to me is get me pumped!  If listened to carefully, a robotic voice sings \\"ROCK!...ROBOT ROCK!\\" to the metal guitar playing.  I'm thinking about asking a DJ at a sports arena to play this song.  I think it's sports-appropriate enough and can get the fans going.  I also find \\"Technologic\\" an awesome anthem.  This tune was used in an iPod commercial.  It's the one with the cartoon voice saying \\"Buy it, Use it, Break it, Fix it, Trash it, Change it, now Upgrade it.....\\"  It's hard for me to hit the stop button while playing this.  There's also \\"Brainwasher.\\"  This track sounds like something heard in an old video game.  Everything sounds video game-ish, even the vocalist saying \\"I AM THE BRAINWASHER!\\"  It's a weird song.  But I love it anyway!  Another song on this CD, \\"Steam Machine,\\" includes whispering vocals saying \\"Steeeeeam machiiiiiine.\\"  It probably fits best for the song since it sounds a bit like steam.      There are a few negatives from this album, however.  \\"Make Love\\" is kinda my least favorite track on the album.  It's repetitive the whole way through and very slow and blunt.  When first playing this track, I was driving in my car.  I almost fell asleep behind the wheel, it was so boring.  \\"Emotion\\" isn't as bad.  But it's still boring.  I would hardly waste another seven minutes of my life listening to that.    Overall, a very nice album.  Daft Punk sure did some awesome work on this CD.  I'm going to have months of fun listening to this.  I'll eat my favorite hat if I don't.

B000003TA4|5.0|Why do all these reviews have to put another album or this one down, in order to prove your opinion? I personally recall the first time I ever heard Smells like Teen Spirit, and I was blown away. For those comparing this to Pearl Jam, I also love Pearl Jam's TEN, but in a different way. It's really apples and oranges for my money. Nirvana had a different sound and a more angsty approach than Pearl Jam. I also Loved Mother Love Bone, Especially APPLE, but again, it can't be compared to Pearl Jam, as MLB were much more mellow. <br /> <br />The bottom line here is, there are plenty of great albums, and it's not necessary to slag one, in order to promote another. This album IS a milestone in music, end of story.

B00097A5I6|5.0|If there was a 4 1/2 stars, I would have picked that, so I rounded up to 5. The only other Oasis albums that compare in quality are Whats The Story, Definitely Maybe, and possibly Be Here Now. I mean, I haven't heard a class tune from them since 1997 and here they are all of the sudden back with song after song or toe-tapping, sing-a-long music. Even some of their b-sides like Pass Me Down The Wine (an iTunes exclusive bonus track) are amazing and should have been on the album... just like the old days! <br /> <br />If you want just plain good rock n roll, buy this album. It's exactly what you're looking for and you'll enjoy it.
B00004BZ0N|3.0|I replaced my original release cd with this remaster and gave away my original to a friend.  Tragically, some dope in the control room, as well as every subsequent jerk at the record label, did not hear the damage done to the elevator bell in the beginning of Koka Kola. <br /> <br />How can it be that the best album ever by the best band ever be treated like this?  Later, a new remaster was released as a double cd with other material never before available.  Did they fix the problem from the first remaster???  NO.   <br /> <br />I can't tell you not to buy it if you don't own it because it is a must have for any cd collection to be complete, but write a letter to the jerks at the record label and demand more respect for the Clash!!! <br /> <br />Major labels complain about how much money they are loosing to piraters, etc, then they release material without any apparent quality control.  Tell Rod Rooter this is not acceptable!
B00079FUI6|5.0|\\"Desperate Housewives\\" is an absolute phenomenon! I remember I saw an advert on Channel 4 over here in England advertising this new show and just from the advert I knew I'd love it. So did 5 million other Brits who tuned in when the first episode premiered on January 5th 2005. Since that first episode the nation has been hooked. This is easily the most popular US-import show in the country and literally everyone at my college talks about it on a Thursday morning after the previous night's episode. I must confess, I watch it religiously on my own in our conservatory every Wednesday night and if anyone dare disturb me I will be seriously p***ed off!<br /><br />In a world saturated with reality TV and bad talk shows, Desperate Housewives is a breath of fresh air. Creator Marc Cherry is a Godsend to women all over the world, and it was clear from the beginning that this show was going to become totally global. I mean I've heard stories about this show getting upwards of 30 million viewers in America! That's absolutely incredible, and this DVD will sell millions upon its release, trust me.<br /><br />So what makes Desperate Housewives so addictive? For me, there are a number of things. Firstly, the cast is impeccable. The four main stars of the show are Teri Hatcher (who plays Susan Mayer), Marcia Cross (who plays Bree Van De Kamp), Felicity Huffman (who plays Lynette Scarvo) and the sensational Eva Longoria (who plays Gabrielle Solis). My personal favourite is Marcia Cross, because she is just so amazing. She is a gorgeous, fabulous gay icon and she is a true star! Her character is so particular. To begin with, we hate her, but over time she grows on you.<br /><br />Secondly, I would say the blend of genres make this show effortlessly appealing. The mix of comedy and drama is achieved within a degree of perfection, tossing the viewer from laugh-out-loud moments to those moments of tension. It is a credit to the writers that they have sustained this throughout the entire first season. If we are to look at other successful shows such as Buffy, The X-Files, Friends, Will & Grace and Sex And The City, the pinnacle of excellence usually peaks after the first season, so for Desperate Housewives to hit the mark straight away sets the bar very high. I'm confident that they can improve the formula in the second season.<br /><br />The imagery of the first season is just beautiful, too. The white picket fences, show home houses and lush green lawns define the show, and Wisteria Lane in general. However, they also serve as a major juxtaposition to the sensational storylines that bubble away under the surface. The murders, the affairs, the breakdowns and the shameful secrets are what keep us hanging on like vultures indeed, desperate, for more. Speaking of the storylines, they may not be the most original or inventive, but its with the amazing cast of actors that these storylines become something on their own entirely. So much happens in one episode that you may totally forget about it in the next! There is a small army of co-stars who decorate the sidewalks of the show as the spotlight falls on our four main characters and the troubles that revolve around them.<br /><br />The season's main draw is the death of Mary Alice Young, and why she chose to kill herself with a revolver. This question is carried throughout the whole season, from the very first few minutes of the pilot episode where we see her kill herself. Details are gradually revealed throughout the season as the plot thickens. I'm not going to go into much detail about this storyline, or indeed the many others that make this season so jam-packed, because I'm sure you know it all yourself, but what I will say is that I love the way the characters are portrayed. There's a sense of fantasy about the whole neighborhood, in that everyone is a nosey beggar and wants to know everyone else's business. One such example is Mrs. Huber. The way death doesn't seem to affect many of the show's characters is also part of its appeal, as the show adopts an almost retro look at classic comedies with nifty stories and camp backdrops.<br /><br />OVERALL GRADE: 10/10<br /><br />After so many of my favourite TV shows ended in 2003 and 2004, I was looking for something new to watch, but I never thought I'd find something as brilliant as Desperate Housewives. I say find, when really I should say 'realise' because this show has hit like a tidal wave. I sure will be buying the first season on DVD when it is finally released over here in the UK, and I'm sure you need no motivation from me to buy it as well! This review merely serves as a culmination of TV's biggest phenomenon.

B0007Y08IS|5.0|As usual Trey Parker and Matt Stone have succeeded in creating a parody laden with comic genius. Not only is the war on terrorism put in it's place, but they also satirize a slew of other topics, such as politically outspoken actors and even the film industry its self with the use of mellowdramatic dialog and a cheesy (yet hysterical) soundtrack. The feature also feeds the need for more puppet movies. See this film, f*** yeah!
B0000AGWRX|1.0|I hate Fox. They're re-releasing all their films. First they did it with Dodgeball, I Robot, Man on Fire and The Day After Tomorrow. Now they're doing it with Die Hard, Planet of the Apes, Fight Club and other films. WITH NO NEW SPECIAL FEATURES! <br /> <br />This DVD is EXACTLY the same as the one included in the \\"Die Hard Trilogy\\" pack. It's a scam. The same DVDs packaged in a new case, so the die-hard fans will feel as though they have to buy them in order to complete \\"the collection.\\" <br /> <br />DO NOT BE FOOLED! This has already been released. If you have Die Hard: Five Star Collection, you already own this movie. DO NOT fall for their scam.
B0002F7I9Y|1.0|This man is really genius! <br /> Unfortunately, I can't listen to his masterpieces without headache.
B00005JNTX|1.0|I really liked and loved this movie. And I knew when comes to DVD, I would buy it for sure for my DVD collection ,but this DVD very simple and plain. Not double disk or DTS or nothing an all...if u really love this movie like I did,Wait a while till end the year I am VERY SURE they going to come with DTS or Superbit Or Dir cut,I am going to wait for sure to get the whole McCoy. These days they do that with most movies, Then after few months they come up with all loaded stuffs on DVD.

B00097DX3U|3.0|Those writing rave reviews for this album and giving it 4 or 5 stars are either easily pleased or unaware of the real quality music that is out there.  The fact of the mattter is, to nobody's surprise, is that the quality of music is getting lessor and lessor.  So, people seemed to be pleased with less this days, out of necessity.  Well, this CD exemplifies that trend (i.e.  the new U2 albums. etc.). <br /> <br />The simple fact of the matter is that this album doesn't compare, unfortunately, to the first Audioslave album and it is just one of many mediocre albums being released as of late.  To try to compare this album to a \\"masterpiece\\", etc., is just plain silly.  You either have to be very young and unaware what is really out there (in the past), or you are a retailer and you are trying to sell something. <br /> <br />Chis Cornell is one of the best lead singers out there today.  But, Chris Cornell does not sound as good on this album as he did on the last.  But, of course, he is not getting any younger.  Steven Tyler is the only rock singer I know who actually improved with age, and sobriety, until he reached the about of 50 or so.  And, for the love of god, would somebody please teach Tom Morello how to play a guitar solo!  I live in Seattle (home of Soundgarden), so obviously Audioslave gets a lot of radio support and airplay.  But, there are hundreds of guys, alone, in this city that can run circles around Tom Morello playing the guitar!  Someone please tell him to start playing the guitar and stop playing the computer that that he is pumping his guitar through to get all of his self-indulgent guitar effects.  Anybody can compensate with technology!  I need not say more; it is obvious in listening to this album (and the first, to a degree). <br /> <br />So, there you have it.  An honest review by an honest fan (and a muscian), who knows that these guys are capable of a whole lot more.  In the meantime, this album was \\"dialed in\\" and despite a few standouts,it is just a bland sophmoric output.  I wish it was better.  I really do. <br /> <br /> <br />
0440237688|4.0|I think the Giver was a good book. I would like it better if the setting wasnt so cruel because they had no future and you could not decied any thing.You had no books and could not choose your own family.You would not know what love is. I also think that Jonas was very luky because he found out what colors are,what snow is,what feelings are,and what being hurt is like.He was very fourtunate to run away from it all.Gabriel was allso very luky to go with Jonas because they could have a future.I think there could be a second book.Isa25121
0385512058|4.0|Much of the networking \\"wisdom\\" in this book can be found in other books and articles, for example in the works of Harvey MacKay, who is also a great networker (Ferrazzi spells MacKay's name wrong in his attribution). However, what you don't find in those books are up-to-date examples from someone currently hot in the field. Ferrazzi's age and jobs makes him a more relevant role model to today's up-and-comers than does an \\"old timer\\" like MacKay. (That was meant in the greatest respect.)<br /><br />It is good to have another example and reminder of the importance of building relationships. There were some fresh approaches I have not read before, for example the dinner parties, and some approaches that have been around for along time, as Ferrazzi acknowledges, such as Dale Carnegie.<br /><br />Ferrazzi does toot his own horn, and at times seems full of himself, but, if I had accomplished as much as he has I might sound that way as well if I were writing about it. It is tough to give examples from your own life without dropping some names. So ignore that part.<br /><br />Some people think that building relationships is manipulative. Well that is hogwash. That can be said about any relationship we have. Guys court girls to get them to like them. You dress nice, you clean up, you send cards, you remember birthdays. Is that manipulative.... sure, but who cares.<br /><br />Anyway, the advice is sound, follow it and you will improve in your networking ability, in the number of people you know and meet and eventually the number of people you do business with and become friends with.

0321334876|5.0|Recently, I decided to make my programming language of choice to be C++ (although I use VB, C#, C++ and occasionally java).<br />I bought Effective C++ Third Edition & Effective STL (both by Mr. Meyers). The author knows all that he is talking about and he has generously clarified things like a personal tutor. I wish that I had a chance to read these books some years ago. I think I have acquired something which can help me build good programs and my professional confidence.
B000002LCK|4.0|This is a great compilation of New Order's works up to 1987.  New Order shouldn't be considered just an 80's synth-dance-band.  New Order is the regrouping of Joy Division after the untimely loss of Ian Curtis.  Joy Division and New Order embody some of the most raw music ever to be released.  New Order is still releasing albums today (at that still releasing great albums) way after its counterparts disbanded.  If you want to get into New Order, but don't know where to start, then you should buy this compilation first.
B0007Z4S4C|5.0|I don't agree with the guy above that said that there aren't any catchy tunes on this new record. I can't get these lyrics out of my head and the melodies are so infectious and feel so natural and uncontrived that I am indeed humming them and singing them to myself over and over. This is surely Plant's best solo work since the Honeydrippers Vol. 2. and I expect it to take top place in my CD changer all summer. I even payed a premium to get tickets to his NYC Beacon Theatre show which is sold out.  <br /> <br />All the King's Horses is one of his most beautiful acoustic melodies since Going to California and Plant's lyrics and voice have reached a maturity that grabs you by the mind, heart and gyrating groin in a way that Whole Lotta Love never did. I had weak enthusiasm for his previous strained reunited efforts with Page, but his new band the Strange Sensation has created a unique sound that I hope will be around for many years to come. Plant Rules! Don't miss this CD! A Classic!

B00005QZ7U|5.0|If I had seen this in the theater I think I might not have made it through the first 30 minutes. I was in shock. I don't know what I expected but it certainly wasn't what I got. I was in a sensory daze blown away with overloaded ciruits until it came---the The Elephant Love Medley. Ewan McGregor's uncanny ability to put that sparkle he must reseve only for love scenes and his lucky wife in his eye brought it all together.<br /><br />No longer were there crazy dwarves or yodeling and goons and sitars, suddenly the love story came together. It's always like that with me in my reviews I guess. Whatever is going on around the characters is secondary to the story. While Moulin Rouge is essentialy a script about saving a theater by selling the favors of a courtesian. The theater has no heart without the players within, and the beating of that heart will only continue as long as the love between Satine and Christian thrives.<br /><br />There is plenty of humor, especially in the \\"Like a Virgin\\" scene in which Satine is given a night's reprieve from the evil Duke, but Satine is already dying of consumption as the first frames of the movie unfold.<br /><br />In short we know there are no happy endings in this lush, vibrant, loud and gauche world of the Moulin Rouge err we first run away from home seeking out fortune as a writer with Christian. Living through Christian we know our entire presence at the Moulin Rouge is doomed from day one. Each spin of the wheel that graces Satine's apartments brings us closer to our unhappy ending and still there is nothing to do but sit as an audience and watch as the pre-ordained events unfold before us.<br /><br />The story of Moulin Rouge is not a happy one. The Green Fairy is no Tinkerbell. The story of Moulin Rouge is something that we must take piece by piece and bit by bit forgetting the doom that awaits and evaluate each scene on it's own merit. In doing so can we honestly say this is a movie that deserved to be up there as Oscar nominated best picture of the year? Can we look at Nicole Kidman and see the expensive prostitute who know's her worth in gold and has traded it for ink and paper? Can we believe that spark in Ewan McGregor's eye when he goes from peasant Bohemian writer to ardent lover in minutes?<br /><br />I think so. I think Baz Luhrman hit his mark in the red curtain series. Strictly Ballroom, William Shakespeares's Romeo and Juliette, and his masterpiece Moulin Rouge.<br /><br />A standing ovation for all three.s Oscar nominated best picture of the year?

B00006J9OT|4.0|I ordered three of Krall's albums (including this one) and still fail to understand where the magic is in her voice. The description so many others have given as \\"sultry\\" just isn't apparent here. This aside, the true value here is the music. Darn she is a fantastic jazz pianist, and her bandmates complement her every drop of the hammer.
B000002GFT|5.0|This is my favorite Fairport album. Picked this up in the early 70's and fell in love with it. Saw them live a few times in St. Louey. Man they rocked the place. Dave Swarbrick's fiddle playing was amazing, along with Richard Thompson's guitar and Sandy Denny's beautiful voice made this band a pleasure to see live. Just love the ballads whether hand pinned by the members or the traditional ones. To bad this line up didn't hand around long.
B00082IJ08|5.0|BUY IT!!!! I do not have the first Gorillaz release so I had absolutely no pretense as to what to expect.  This album is just amazing.  At first, I thought that there might be too much rap on it and let me say that that is not true.  This is more Beatles than Jay-Z.  Pick this one up for sure.

A high density rock mass weighing over 8 tons has been found in the Arctic buried underneath 200 feet of solid ice. This giant rock turns out to be a meteorite which impacted Earth over 300 years ago. Rachel is sent to the Arctic location to verify the authenticity of the meteorite. The President has already assembled a team of NASA and civilian scientists to study the meterorite and to document the findings. Amongst this team is one Michael Tolland, oceanographer and TV personality.<br /><br />The President will make an announcement to the World press of the discovery of the meteorite but this is not just any meteorite. This astounding discovery will make or break NASA and the President's future life in politics. Ready to step into the President's shoes is his fierce opponent and strongest critic of NASA, Senator Sedgewick Sexton.<br /><br />Meanwhile back in the Arctic, Rachel and Michael discover unexplained inconsistencies in the evidence presented about the meteorite.

B0001GOH6Q|4.0|Sadly I'm not giving this my usual 5 star Ewan review and it's not because of Ewan. Or maybe it is!?!?! I don't know. I think it's a story that is either too small or too big but somehow it just doesn't fit. And Billy Crudup is just plain boring in everything.<br /><br />I almost snuck into the theater to see this because I was seeing LOTR ROTK for the 2nd time and it was almost over while Big Fish was just beginning. My morality won out and I waited for the dvd. The first time I watched it I was just plain bored. I don't know why but I was expecting something bigger, something more magical and exciting. It came across as one of those Babe the Blue Ox stories I remember as a kid. The giant wasn't giant, the witch wasn't scary, and the fish wasn't very big.<br /><br />Since then I've seen it on cable and my 10yr old son sat down to watch it with me. Any time he shows interest I pay attention just because he never watches anything I have on.(Unlike my 7yr old daughter who watched Lost in Translation last week). Well he seemed to get it, and since he did I paid more attention and I got a lot more of it too.<br /><br />I love Ewan McGregor, I really do, but I wonder if he was what I didn't like about the movie. It was so contrived to begin with that having him stretch his accent, even though he did it well, along with the wacky plotlines may have been too much.<br /><br />Albert Finney was superb. I would have believed anything he said, and Jessica Lange was teriffic in a very subtle performance. All of the actors were great except Billy Crudup and Ewan McGregor who just didn't fit for some reason. Maybe Ewan played it too over the top and Billy was too reserved I don't know.<br /><br />I can't help but think there was at least 20 minutes left on the cutting room floor that may have made this a much better film.<br /><br />All in all it is watchable and the performances of the supporting cast are very enjoyable despite a shaky plotline and some iffy acting from the leads. If this were in less capable hands there is no way it would merit 4 stars but the Tim Burton visuals and the fairytale quality bounce it up that extra notch.from the leads.

B000069AUI|5.0|Coldplay is awesome! I'd say they're almost as good as the Beatles were, but in they're own genre. Really, this is a MUST buy if you're into soft rock or alternative stuff. They completley took everyone bt storm with they're first album \\"Parachutes\\". This, I'm sad to say isn't as good as the first one but still really nice. The first track on the album, \\"Politik\\" is an excellent showcase of what their made up of and is simmilar to some of their earlier stuff. \\"Clocks\\" was their biggest hit on this album and if you listen to english radio you've probably heard it a gazillion times. Overall really nice. If you haven't heard anything else from them, i suggest you start with Parachutes.
0802130208|1.0|Maybe it's an American thing, or a Catholic thing, or a south-of-the-Mason-Dixon-line thing, but, as an English reader - and one far from averse to bodily function jokes - I found this book tedious, repellent and (ultimately) pointless. At the risk of being numbered among the 'confederacy' by some of the more smug reviewers, I find the showers of praise heaped on this pile of ordure incomprehensible, let alone the fact that it won a Pulitzer. <br /> <br />Leave aside the inherent and all-pervading meanness of every single character. Leave aside the constant inconsistencies in their behaviour and the ridiculous unreality of the situations they find themselves in. Even leave aside the loud grinding of machinery heard throughout, as the author laboriously winches the pieces into place for the next piece of utterly implausible 'slapstick' comedy. The real question is, what is the reader supposed to take away from all this? Are we supposed to sympathise with the odious Reilly? What point is the author trying to convey? As the heading says, beats me. <br /> <br />In the final analysis, do any of the characters learn anything? Do they grow and develop? Has there been some unifying meaning to their experiences? Do we genuinely care what happens to any of them? No to all.
0316172324|2.0|This book was mostly full of stories that illuminate the fairly obvious.  Basically, the theme is that over-analyzing can often be worse than simply making a snap judgment.  There is such a thing as too much information (especially when not interpreted correctly), and likewise, snap judgments are often wrong.  How to find a balance?  No answer in this book.<br /><br />I did find some of the stories and information entertaining, insightful, and perhaps slightly useful; but overall, I was glad it was a short book--I would not have finished it had it been any longer.
B00018D3JQ|4.0|This is not for purists. People who hate Scissor's Sisters 'Comfortably Numb', for example, are not gonna be happy with french bossa re-enditions of Joy Division, The Clash, Depeche Mode and other holy cows of 80's post punk and new wave, no matter how well made and creative they are. However, if you like bossa nova and eclectic easy listening; if you enjoy a purr with french accent stroking your ear; if you have a sense of humor, and finally if you appreciate a charming, imaginative and wholesome take on tunes you've known and loved all your life, then you will really enjoy this album.
B000005J56|5.0|This CD is a true embodiment of what any music should be and feel like to listen to. I used the word feel, because when you listen to this music that is exactly what you are doing. Feeling it. The depth and intimacy of every track on this album is extraordinary, and what makes it even more worthwhile is that every artist on this album is they're playing their music because they love it. Not for monetary gains, or to produce a one hit wonder. This music is clearly in their souls; this music is quite clearly alive! Buy this album, listen to it and find yourself transported to Cuba itself. You can almost feel the heat of the night as you sit on a rickety chair, outside a small bar on a Cuban side street letting this music flow into you. <br /> <br />A truly magical musical experience for all..... <br />

B0000004V2|5.0|The Stone Roses are one the defining artists of the late Eighties. When they first came on the scene their name was Graffitied all over Manchester. Simply fans of the Roses Knew what was coming and needed to share it with the world! and on the evidence of this record they knew their stuff!! some amazing classics like I wanna be Adored, I am the resurrection, Waterfall just to mention a few. Basically all the songs on this album are classics. I agree with all the previous reviews that have given it a massive 5 stars. Not all these people can be wrong! Just go and buy it trust me you will not be dissapointed!!
B00005QZ7U|5.0|Moulin Rouge is probably my favorite movie of the last ten years, and it's definitely in the running for my favorite movie ever. <br /> <br />Baz Luhrmann revolutionized the movie musical with this film, and I firmly believe that Chicago (and, to a lesser extent, The Phantom of the Opera) owes its success to this movie.  I love movie musicals, but they're usually horribly cheesy because they're a direct adaptation from stage to film, and the two mediums are not interchangable.  On stage, you can go from talking to singing and dancing, and the audience goes along with that because they expect it.  The sets and costumes combined with the live audience remind us that it's not real, and so we can accept the spectacle of song and dance.  The problem with most movie musicals (West Side Story is a prime example of this) is that the film goes from a straight scene and dialogue to singing and dancing, and it's a huge jolt for the audience.  Throw in a more realistic set than you'd get on stage (such as the streets of New York), and it's impossible to expect the audience to suspend their disbelief. <br /> <br />But with Moulin Rouge Baz Luhrmann created a surreal, larger-than-life, heightened reality where characters can break out into song and dance and the audience members won't bat an eye.  Through fast camera cuts, outlandish costumes, computer-generated animations (like the singing moon), and luscious sets, Luhrmann reminds us at every turn that this isn't real--and to just sit back and enjoy the ride. <br /> <br />The casting for this movie was brilliant.  Ewan McGregor and Nicole Kidman play the star-crossed lovers Christian and Satine, and they do all their own singing--and they're better than you'd expect.  (McGregor, especially, has a surprisingly hauting, powerful voice.  The movie is worth watching for his performance alone.)  Richard Roxburgh is marvelous (and often overlooked) as the sniveling, rat-faced Duke who wants to keep Satine for himself.  The cast is rounded out by Jim Broadbent, who plays the larger-than-life manager of the Moulin Rouge, and John Leguizamo, who plays Christian's friend Toulouse-Letrec. <br /> <br />This 2-disc DVD is packed with tons of bonus features, including two commentaries, interviews with the cast, documentaries, and uncut footage of the dance El Tango de Roxanne.  It's definitely worth picking up if you liked this movie. <br /> <br />This film is, to put it simply, pure art.  Stunning visuals and fantastic performances abound, and there's so much to see that you'll catch something new every time.  I highly, highly recommend it.
B00097A5I6|5.0|Oasis is a band that can go from heavy rockers (Turn Up the Sun) and can easily transition into power ballads (Let There Be Love) with ease. That is the sign of a truly great Rock & Roll Band.  <br /> <br />Thankfully, Oasis don't make 1 dimensional albums consisting soley of sad, soppy love songs like thier followers; Coldplay.  <br /> <br />Don't Believe The Truth is an amazing matured album and a return to form for Oasis. Easily, their best since (What's The Story) Morning Glory. And this is only the beginning... I just cannot wait for their next album now. I hope it's a self titled album. Because I think it will blow people away more than even this one!  <br /> <br />Oasis are legends and will go down in history one day whether people would like to admit it or not.

078401213X|4.0|Well written screenplay executed brilliantly, with top-notch music. Max, the main character is obsessed with number theory. He considers mathematics as the universal language, and that there is a pattern in everything that occurs in this universe, he sets about trying to find it.  <br /> <br />After him are people who are interested in his stock market analyses for monetary purposes, and more strangely, a group of Rabbis who are convinced the same pattern of numbers is the key to their salvation. Now this can be interpreted by viewers in two different ways.  <br /> <br />Personal NOTE: I think Max is loosing it and these people are a figment of his imagination. However, Max is the only one who can understand the semantics of the 216 digit number that is key to the universal lock. In the end, Max succeeds on his quest, but what he understands is never revealed to us. What he does however is wierd enough for me to give this movie 4 stars. <br /> <br />This movie maynot be for everyone. Viewers who thought that movies like Fight Club, A Clockwork Orange & Full Metal Jacket had pretty intellectual messages, then don't let this one go by. Think about owning it, only after you have rented it. <br />
B00080ZG10|5.0|Ever since 1990's \\"Goodfellas,\\" Martin Scorsese has been a brilliant filmmaker in search of a truly worthy project. <br /> <br />He's found it in \\"The Aviator\\" the story of Howard Hughes, billionaire financier, moviemaker, squirer of movie stars, genius in the world of aviation, and paranoid germaphobic. <br /> <br />Scorsese exhibits his usual brilliance in recreating the era (his staging of Hughes \\"Blue Angels\\" for example is breathtaking) and his trademark use of popular music (in this case Artie Shaw, Glenn Miller, Bing Crosby, Louis Armstrong et al) is truly unmatched; Scorcese makes particularly effective use of Shaw's \\"Nighmare\\" as a backdrop for Hughes' periodic descents into madness.. <br /> <br />With all of Scorsese's brilliance, however, the center of the film is Leonardo DiCapro's flawless peformance as Howard Hughes--Di Caprio catches every nuance and gesture of Hughes' larger than life persona--he is abetted by a supporting cast that is uniformly superb, the great Kate Winslett as Katie Hepburn, John C Reilly as Noah Dietrich, an amazing performance by Alan Alda as a coruprt U.S. Senator, and the incredibly beautiful Kate Beckensale as Ava Gardner (Miss Beckensale's beauty literally matches, if not suprpasses that of Miss Gardner--no easy feat). <br /> <br />\\"The Aviator\\" is genuine proof of what Hollywood can do when it decides to make a great movie that lifts the spirit and doesn't insult the intelligence of its of its audience--in this day and age a phenomenon that is all too rare.... <br /> <br />********************* <br />DVD is offers a superb color and sound transfer and contains almost three hours of special features for both Howard Hughes and motion picture enthusiasts........................ <br />
B00097A5I6|5.0|Don't Believe The Truth is what Oasis has tried to get back to since Be Here Now. This is their best album since Morning Glory.<br /><br />At only forty three minutes, you'd think you'd want more to hear however, satisfaction never came in such a small package. Song after song, you'll find yourself singing the lyrics after only hearing one verse.<br /><br />There's not a weak song on this disc so, you won't be skipping tracks. I can't wait to see what the band will pick as their next single. It's that good.<br /><br />Bottom line: 11 superb tracks and memorable lryics. This blows Heathen Chemistry out of the water.
B0007Y4TVU|2.0|This album has some good moments but its pretty disappointing considering how long we had to wait for it.  For one thing its even shorter than usual.  System albums are usually short but this is their shortest both in terms of running time and number of tracks.  The short length wouldn't have been so bad if all of the songs were strong tracks but this is simply not the case.   <br /> <br />Track one could have been a great song but instead it is unrealized being barely over a minute in length.  Honestly do we really need a one minute intro on an album that is already so short? BYOB and Revenga are great but after that we get 4 straight tracks of filler.  Its not that these tracks (4-7) are horrible.  Some of them are okay musically but have bad lyrics as with \\"Cigaro\\".  \\"Radio/Video\\" and \\"Violent Pornagraphy\\" would perhaps be strong songs in the catolog of another band, but they are really just bad System parodies--both of these songs have essentially been done before by System in the form of songs that are simular but better.   <br /> <br />Also, the fact of the shorter album makes the juxaposition of the vocal duties from Serj to Daron harder to swallow.  Serj's amazing vocals are a trademark of this band, be it his haunting dirge-hymn style, his rapid fire datribes, and even his comedic escapades ala \\"pogo stick\\" or \\"eevil\\".  Daron's voice is not bad--in fact if this were any other band I would say \\"Fine, hand the man the mic.\\"  But this is a band with Serj in it, the only vocalist in rock today who even comes close to being as good as Maynard. <br /> <br />The songwriting picks back up from tracks 8 till the end, and we even get to hear a little experimentation (fairly sucessfully) on Old School Hollywood. So essentially we get a System sandwich with some strong tracks at the begining and the end and some filler in the middle. <br /> <br />So what does all of this mean?  First of all this is without a doubt the weakest system of a down album.  Those who say thisis their finest have no idea what they are talking about.  On an album this short you can't afford to have filler and this album does.  It also sells itself short by taking mic time from serj.  The shorter length makes the presence of the filler felt all the more strongly.  In conclusion, while this album has its moments its hard not to feel disappointed, even cheated by it.  I was going to give it three stars but in the end it doesn't deserve more than 2.5 and enough people gave it 5 that I have no problem giving it two to make up for those who have been overly generous. <br /> <br />I am generally the first to applaud a band for being courageous and daring to do things differently but I just can't do so in this case because the results are just an inferior album.  And it is so short it almost makes you feel like the band was being a little lazy.  In fairness to the band they are set to release a companion disc to this album later in the year.  But I have a feeling that I am going to wish that they had taken the strong tracks off this album and the other and made one strong, consistent album.  Time will tell.  But I certainly hope that hypnotize is better than this.

I had to give 1 star because I wouldn't be able to post otherwise. <br />I just don't understand why so many people made a big deal out of this \\"film.\\" the story is not there, period. of course, a film doesnt really need to have a linear story, but this non-story has no meaning of being a non-story. Is the picture beautiful in this \\"film\\" even? absolutely not. this film is definitly lost in-between translation (of nothing, I should say). all the misunderstandings between the main characters and japanese people in the \\"film\\" do not make any sense or have any purpose.  another example of westerner's blind fascination about japanese culture-- totally blind and empty.
078322804X|4.0|What can you say about this movie that has not been said before?  It's a classic.  Great music, great cameo's and a mission from God.  Let's talk about it.  Sure it is silly.  After all how many car chases have you seen on the evening news that run through shopping malls. . . or how many cops have you seen who fire their pistols willy-nilly into a crowd to stop the infamous blues brothers. . . or car pile-ups that defy imagination.  But then there is the blues. . . not only the great music, but Jake and Elwood Blue themselves.  Two men on a mission from God. . . seeking redemption for their lives that had gone bad.  Not too bad of a theme.  But what is that sub-plot about Jake's ex (Carrie Fisher) about?  It adds nothing to the movie.  But then, even great movies has their flaws.  By the way this is definitely a guys movie.  So next time you are stuck at home on a rainy Saturday afternoon, slip the Blues Brothers into your DVD and get ready for some great fun.
B000006NPY|2.0|The second song is the only good one. The rest is terrible; sounds like old nightclub music.
B0007DAZW8|4.0|After pining away for a new CD from them since 2001's Discovery, I was totally excited when I found out that there was a new CD out there. I ran out and bought it immediately. When I saw that I-Pod commercial that plays \\"Technologic\\" I thought 'that sounds like Daft Punk!' and sure enough it was! Technologic is the best song on this album! Play this one at parties and watch the break-dancers pack the floor! It's just amazing! I get chills when I hear it. The albums title track is great, also, It gets stuck in my head for the rest of the day when I hear it. Other stand out tracks are- Steam Machine and Robot Rock. This album is a lot like \\"Homework\\" and very reminescent of the electronic <br />Pioneers \\"Kraftwerk\\". <br />If I had to describe this album in one line, it wiould be: <br />Better than Homework, but still not as good as Discovery. <br /> <br />
B0007Y08IS|4.0|People are taking this film too seriously. It was completely Apolitical. The films main targets appeared to be hysteria, self-importance, pumped up aggression, mindless blockbuster entertainment, and the human propensity for thinking what everybody else thinks because it's less daunting (and more self-righteously rewarding) to do so.  There was a long overdue attack on the deluded mindset of certain celebrities who - not content with being idolised, paid more than many third-world countries entire economic budgets, fortunate enough to do a job that's not back-breaking but interesting and exciting - presume to tell the rest of us (mortals) how we ought to think. How it must hurt to see their ego's punctured using the very medium that inflated it.  The film was not homophobic either, it merely ridiculed the piety of those who like to wear their 'compassion' on their sleeves (or their lapels to be more accurate). Of course Aids charities need highlighting, but we have tons of celebrities here in Britain who would hardly lift a finger for a starving third-world child, or dying cancer patient, but fall over themselves to attend red-ribbon events - with every two-bit fame junkie declaring; 'I've lost so many gay friends', as if this transparent (and probably exagerated) declaration about their social circle were somehow cast iron evidence of possessing a maverick free spirit. Team America is both puerile AND intelligent, which is why it's so funny. The ending with the anal/groin area/political analogy was one of the cleverest things I've seen (if a bit crude).
B0000A02TZ|3.0|There are some movies I can watch repeatedly and enjoy the 5th time as much as I did the 1st time, seeing something different in it each time.<br /><br />This is not one of those movies.<br /><br />What I like best about it is that it reminds me of the 70s.  It reminds me of the hippie generation that I am a part of.<br /><br />John Belushi's character is still great to watch.  He has a wonderful, gentle, absurd sense of humor.  He is the diamond in this cast.  The rest of the performers here are dwarfed by his talent.<br /><br />I like the way the movie deals with blacks and Jews.  The black guys in the club are menacing, frighten the frat boys out of the club, and seem to be about to rape the white girls.  We see later that the white girls are fine, and weren't attacked.  As for the Jewish girls, the advice given is to just mention civil rights, folk music, or some other popular liberal cause of the day, and you'll get right in.  That was cute.  And the John Belushi character has a Jewish sounding name, Blutarsky with a y.<br /><br />I also like two of the women in the movie.  There's whatshisname's girlfriend (sorry, I don't remember the character, but he is the only guy in the frat with a girlfriend), and there's Mrs. Dean Wormer.  They are both a lot of fun to watch.<br /><br />Doesn't it seem that the bad guys of this film, the conservative military types, are in the ascendancy in America now?<br /><br />It was a good touch to add, in the postscript of the film that was included with the dvd, the \\"where are they now\\" segment, that Blutarsky ended up being elected president of the USA.  This is a jab at the younger president Bush, known for his wild antics in his younger days.  Bush wasn't quite as much of a screwup as Blutarsky, but I think it was pretty close.  However, Blutarsky never would have made the drastic turn to Christian fundamentalism and opposition to scientific research that our current president did.  Attack Iraq?  Yeah.  He'd do that.hat.
B000001F66|4.0|After \\"Days of Future Passed,\\" with its fusion of progressive rock and the London Festival Orchestra the Moody Blues provided more of the same, only different (i.e., a Mellotron instead of the full symphonic orchestra since Decca did not want to pay for another one despite the success of the aforementioned previous album). On their 1968 release \\"In Search of the Lost Chord,\\" the songs are shorter and manage to involve both pop and Eastern influences. \\"Ride My See-Saw\\" could be one of the best Hollies song never done by the Hollies. However, the exception that proves the rule here would be \\"Legend of a Mind,\\" the song that causal listeners think is called \\"Timothy Leary\\" or \\"Timothy Leary's dead,\\" or something along those lines:<br /><br />Timothy Leary's dead.<br /><br />No, no, no, no,<br /><br />He's outside looking in<br /><br />Now that Timothy Leary is not only dead but really, most sincerely dead listening to \\"Legend of a Mind\\" from is a different experience. Leary died in 1996 and his remains were cremated and lauched into the final frontier along with those of \\"Star Trek\\" creator Gene Roddenberry. The song is associated with the psychadelic period of the Sixties, although it is hard to imagine why given that the lyrics are full of unqualified praise for Timothy Leary and his astral plane:<br /><br />He'll take you up, he'll bring you down,<br /><br />He'll plant your feet back firmly on the ground.<br /><br />He flies so high, he swoops so low,<br /><br />He knows exactly which way he's gonna go.<br /><br />Ray Thomas wrote \\"Legend of a Mind\\" and also \\"Dr. Livingston I Presume,\\" the other song on the album that makes acid trips sound like a good idea, in that delightfully eccentric way that make the British so endearing. You keep wanting to suspect that there is something tongue-in-cheek going on here, but, no the group seems to be earnest in its adoration as the CD's new notes by the band members. No wonder the Moody Blues were so popular with the counter-culture. Add to this the Eastern influences that pop up at the end of the album in \\"Visions of Paradise\\" and \\"Om.\\" Things get a little self-indulgent on this album, but the experimentation pays off big time with their next effort, \\"On the Threshold of a Dream.\\"<br /><br />In 1968 the Moody Blues, which is a much better name than El Riot & the Rebels, consisted of Justin Hayward (vocals, acoustic & electric guitars, 12-string guitar, sitar, harpsichord, piano, Mellotron, bass, percussion, tablas); Mike Pinder (acoustic guitar, cello, autoharp, harpsichord, Mellotron, piano, bass); John Lodge (acoustic guitar, cello, bass, tambourine, snare drum, background vocals); Ray Thomas (C flute, alto flute, soprano saxophone, background vocals); and Graeme Edge (piano, drums, timpani, tambourine, tablas). The point of detailing all this instrumentation is to evidence that the level of experimentation here was at least the equal of what the Beatles were doing during their legendary \\"Sgt. Pepper\\" period (and Jethro Tull only had one flute). The result was that \\"In Search of the Lost Chord\\" made it to #23 on the Billboard chart. There were two singles released, \\"Ride My See-Saw\\" made it to #61 and \\"Never Comes the Day\\" only got to #91 (A pair of Justin Hawyard songs, \\"Voices in the Sky\\" and \\"The Actor,\\" were both released in the U.K. as singles), and to make sure everything is dotted and crossed, the cover art was by Phil Travers.Add to this the Eastern influences that pop up at the end of the album in \\"Visions of Paradise\\" and \\"Om.\\" Things get a little self-indulgent on this album, but the experimentation pays off big time with their next effort, \\"On the Threshold of a Dream.\\"  <br /> <br />In 1968 the Moody Blues, which is a much better name than El Riot & the Rebels, consisted of Justin Hayward (vocals, acoustic & electric guitars, 12-string guitar, sitar, harpsichord, piano, Mellotron, bass, percussion, tablas); Mike Pinder (acoustic guitar, cello, autoharp, harpsichord, Mellotron, piano, bass); John Lodge (acoustic guitar, cello, bass, tambourine, snare drum, background vocals); Ray Thomas (C flute, alto flute, soprano saxophone, background vocals); and Graeme Edge (piano, drums, timpani, tambourine, tablas).

B000089RVR|5.0|This CD is amazing. No other artist can even come close to what Dido has managed to do with this album, as the whole CD is great, which is rare in todays albums. She has a soft voice that might seem strange the first time you listen to it, but it keeps making you go back for more and more. <br /> <br />White Flag--A great song, but can get kinda old when listen to to much ;) <br /> <br />Stoned--One of the two up-temo songs on the album, it breaks the mood with its great beat and great lyrics. <br /> <br />Life for Rent--A great song that when listen to, explains that you should live your life to the fullest.  <br /> <br />Mary's in india--A good song,but you will probally skip over it the first time you play it about half way in. Don't worry though, because playing the CD the second time, you'll go more and more into the song, and it will quickly become one of your favorites. <br /> <br />See you when you're 40--Again, you will probally skip over it the first time you play it about half way in, but it grows on you, and with its great lyrics  <br /> <br />Don't leave home--At this point in the CD, if you havent heard a whole lot of Dido, you pick up her music that she sings. Its another great song, with the same great voice and the same great lyrics. <br /> <br />Who makes you feel--This song though, stands out. You may wonder whats happening when you hear the opening of it, but Dido then comes in with a higher song than she normally sings, but still manages to pull off a great song. <br /> <br />Sand in my shoes--Another up-tempo track, it explains of a love that she met while away for two weeks, but then had to leave as she went home. Another great one :D <br /> <br />Do you have a little time--The darkest song on the CD, has to be one of the 2 best(See You When Your 40 is tied with me). The strong violin entrence makes you listen to the song, and draws you in. Its just great. <br /> <br />This land is mine--The most out of place song on the CD, this track makes you think more of a folksong than a Dido song. The guitar in the back also backs that up heavily.  <br /> <br />See the sun--There's just something about this song that makes you love it. It speaks of how you shouldn't reflect in the past, and if you do, how to cherish it. You may notice, expecially on a computer, the song is very long, about 10:00, but after See The Sun ends, 2 minutes later (at 7:04, not that I love it that much ;)), another song starts to play.  <br /> <br />So leave your taxi waiting......., the songs suppose to be called \\"Closer\\", and was put on as an afterthought, for an extra something for the listerns, but the song is anything but the quality of an afterthought. It has the same great lyrics, and the same great Dido music in it that makes you just love this CD, and makes you play it over and over and over again.
B0001WTWCO|5.0|Rapturous is the one word I can think which may sum up the entire experience that is \\"The English Patient.\\"  The rapture can be felt at every level of its production; the acting, the editing, the cinematogrophy, the screenplay, the music, the story itself.   The experience is so visceral that at times it seems to transcend the medium of the film and spread itself like an inkstain across the mind.      This is a complex, multilayered, intensely character driven epic; it is a love story, and a tragedy, one whose ramifications spread through the lives of the characters involved like ripples on a pond.  Against a WWII backdrop, Fiennes plays \\"the english patient,\\" a man dying of burn wounds, whose slowly returning memories occur in a series of flashbacks that reiterate his doomed love affair with a married englishwoman (Scott Thomas), which interweaves in various ways with the stories of his eclectic companions, all of whom are emotionally and/or physically scarred in their own ways.      The directing, acting and visualization are utterly hypnotic, helping this film to reach dizzying heights of emotional intimacy.  The only thing which might have been improved was further development of the supporting cast, most especially the character of Hana, beautifully played (and suitably rewarded with a Best Supporting Actress Oscar) by the luminous Juliette Binoche.     Suffice it to say, this film is a masterpiece and was recognized as such by every major film critic out there.  The more I watch it, the more rich and seamless it becomes; instead of being able to pick up on errors, I only pick up more ways to fall into the story.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I think the only reason that this show was cancelled was because of awful promotion. I had no idea that it was on when it was the only way I knew about this show was from friends saying that the creator of buffy made a tv show called firefly and how they bought the dvds and loved them, I love Joss Whedon so I bought these dvds without knowing anything about the show, from the name I actually thought it was going to be about nature. But I am glad I bought the DVDS because this show is incredible I am so glad that they are making a movie based on the show, It will be amazing. The trailer is so cool.
B00005MFVP|5.0|Time and time again we are confronted with artists who put out a great debut album and never climb that high ever again. When it comes to talking about the paradigmatic example of such a phenomenon my choice would be King Crimson and their debut album \\"In the Court of the Crimson King.\\" Released in 1969 with its distinctive cover art, this was the album that set the standard for progressive/psychedelic rock for the next decade. Except for the title track the songs are ensemble efforts by guitarist Robert Fripp, drummer Michael Giles, bass player and lead vocalist Greg Lake, keyboard player Ian McDonald, and lyricist Peter Sinfield.<br /><br />The best track on the album is the first, \\"21st Century Schizoid Man,\\" with its big main riff and jazz-rock middle section (\\"Mirrors\\"). The music is somewhat distorted at times, but that does not stop the group's musical virtuosity from coming through. As you would expect from the title, the song paints a picture of dystopian future that embodies the worst tendencies of the late 1960s, and remains the standard by which other progressive rock epics are judged. In terms of political sensibilities nothing comes close. The song also stands out because the following track, \\"I Talk to the Wind,\\" is more folk-rock and constitutes a sort of cleansing of the palate before proceeding to the rest of the album (it is actually a song members of the group had played on earlier efforts).<br /><br />The title track is not the best King Crimson song, but it is probably their best known one (and the one song that was written just by McDonald and Sinfeld). The conceit is of a medieval court afflicted by a black queen, fire witch, and other equally dark images heading for total destruction. It is a daring finality, teetering on the brink of the sort of bombastic pomposity that often afflicted progressive rock (Emerson, Lake & Palmer's \\"Tarkus Suite,\\" with its synthesizer excess is the example that springs to mind). Musically on this album as a whole it is McDonald who makes the biggest mark on the album, playing mellotron and assorted other instruments like saxophones, although Fripp's guitar is also prominent. When I was growing up the singing voice I most wanted to have was Greg Lake's, and this is the album when he sounds the best. The result is that \\"In the Court of the Crimson King\\" is one of the albums that has to be considered when you are making a list of top albums from the Sixites or in the history of progressive rock music. It does not matter that King Crimson had a revolving door lineup and that it would take them years to come up with anything close to this classic album.a whole it is McDonald who makes the biggest mark on the album, playing mellotron and assorted other instruments like saxophones, although Fripp's guitar is also prominent.

B000003TA4|4.0|I can't overstate the fact that this album defined a generation for about only two or three years. Later releases were met with empathy but nothing really matched this album's boom. \\"Nevermind\\" is the quissential model for Nirvana's career, style-wise: simple music with good lyrics and a mellow overtone, no matter how heavy the music may be. A very good album, but nothing really spectacular. Everyone says that Nirvana were ground-breaking, but there were obviously those before them that did the same thing, but get no credit. That will always happen in the music industry. Quiet Riot were the first hair band to get signed to a major record label, but it didn't make them better than Guns N' Roses. And when I say 'overrated', it doesn't necissarily mean that it's bad. I think this album is good, but not to the extent that people put it over to be. To say that this is the best album in the last 25 years is ludicrous.<br /><br /> All I am really saying is look at the mainstream icons of rock and roll: the Rolling Stones, Led Zeppelin, (unfortunately) U2, the Doors, Black Sabbath, and most importantly, the Beatles. I would not lump Nirvana in this group at all. Cobain's lyrics may have been good, but I doubt he could have written something like McCartney's \\"Yesterday\\" when he was 18 years old.
B0007GAERG|5.0|This album should be recommended listening for all up and coming female vocalists, as a \\"So You'd Like To\\" Guide to making hit albums.  For those that had her down for the count, Mariah bounces back with a vengeance with a first rate album of solid songs, which she co-wrote, backed up by a dream team of collaborators such as Jermaine Dupri, Nelly, Twista, Snoop Dogg, and Pharrell Williams, among others.<br /><br />The Guinness Book of World Records lists her twice, for the highest note hit by a human, and for the largest vocal range.  On this album, Mariah warms up with a few comparatively easy ones, and then launches into octave territory beyond the range of any mere mortal, defying all but the most intrepid karaoke singers.  If \\"Circles\\" were an American Idol qualifying song, no one would get past the try-outs, and if anyone were brave enough to try the retro-sounding \\"Mine Again\\" Simon would be running for the exit in horror.<br /><br />From the first dance friendly single \\"It's Like That\\", to the gospel finale \\"Fly Like a Bird\\", the album combines music genres, flawlessly blending R&B, Hip Hop and Pop into first class entertainment with something for everybody.<br /><br />Amanda Richards, May 31, 2005
B000006OS2|5.0|This is the first of John Wayne's movies where he is GRATUITOUSLY larger than life.  BUT it is a most enjoyable movie with the Duke's usual retinue of friends, family and Batjac employees.  If you have never seen it, don't let reviewers spoil it for you.  Buy it now; you'll love it.  It made such an impression on one or more of the TV show MASH's writers that Radar is seen paraphrasing Wayne's lines from a mudslide free-for-all.  MASH, often with cultural expressions from later years, of course was set in the Korean War which ended ten years BEFORE this classic was made.  It's likely the Duke's absolute best lighthearted film.
6302786770|5.0|On of the most impressive things about \\"The Good, the Bad and the Ugly\\" (\\"Il Buono, il brutto, il cattivo\\") is that it is not director Sergio Leone's best film, which would be his next one, 1968's \\"Once Upon a Time in the West\\" (\\"C'era una volta il West\\"). But this 1966 film has is where Leone moves from his first two spaghetti westerns, the Akira Kurosawa inspired \\"For a Fistful of Dollars\\" (\\"Per un pugno di dollari\\") and \\"For a Few Dollars More\\" (\\"Per qualche dollaro in pi&ugrave;\\"), and starts playing on a grander scale.<br /><br />In listening to the commentary on the DVD version of \\"Once Upon a Time in the West\\" I learned that all of the actors in his films were dubbed because Leone did not bother with sound when he went out to shoot his movies. If you remember how the invention of sound destroyed the more cinematic aspects of the movies by restricting movement so that actors could be near microphones, then you can appreciate the sense of freedom this gave Leone. The result is a distinctive style that goes well beyond Leone's signature juxtaposition of wide vistas and extreme close ups (often in a single shot, without a cut). Leone also likes to take his time, as evidenced by the final three scenes of the film, where Tuco searches for the grave with the gold, the three-way gunfight, and the parting of the two survivors. His films ran long and were routinely shortened (read: \\"butchered\\") for their American releases. But even so, there is a clearly boldness and a flavor to Leone's cinematic vision of the west that is as distinct as that of John Ford or any other classic Hollywood director of westerns you want to name.<br /><br />In the final film of Leone's \\"Man With No Name\\" triology, Clint Eastwood (now called Blondie instead of Joe and Manco but obvious the \\"Good\\" guy) has a new scam going as a bounty hunter who saves his captures from the rope so that the reward goes up and he can move on to the new town and do the same thing all over again. His pigeon, the \\"Ugly\\" Tuco (Eli Wallach), is not exactly happy with the arrangement and finally has the opportunity to reverse their situation. However the former partners find a new unity of purpose when a dying man tells each of them part of the secret location of $200,000 in captured Union cold. Our story takes place in the New Mexico territory (that is where the two particular generals mentioned had minor skirmishes during the Civil War), and the Yankees and Rebels are between the two and the gold. Then, there is the \\"Bad\\" Sentenza (Lee Van Cleef), called Angel Eyes, who has also been on the trail of the gold.<br /><br />From an acting perspective the most impressive performance is that of Wallach, although this is partly by default. Tuco never stops talking while Blondie is a man of very few words (but great timing) and Angel Eyes communicates best when he narrows his eyes and glares at people. In the hands of another actor Tuco might have been more of a buffoon, but Wallach develops one of the most multi-dimension characterizations in the history of Westerns. In those brief moments when Tuco stops talking you can see his mind turning over what to do next before heading off full throttle in a new direction.<br /><br />\\"The Good, the Bad and the Ugly\\" does stand on its own, even though it is the final film of a triology. I originally saw the film in a movie theater and did not see the previous two Leone-Eastwood collaborations until decades later on late night television. But while the order in watching Leone's films is of little consequence to the appreciation of any particular one of them, at some point you should enjoy going through them in chronological order to see exactly how within a five year period he went from ripping off Kurosawa to creating what remains my favorite western of all time.ly\\" Tuco (Eli Wallach), is not exactly happy with the arrangement and finally has the opportunity to reverse their situation.

B0007TKNL0|3.0|Personally, I love the musical the Phantom of the Opera. I was ecstatic when I heard about the movie version. At last I would be able to watch my favorite musical without having to spend ridiculous amounts of money to see it in the theatre.  <br />I saw the movie, and it was enjoyable, but it was not the musical. There was something missing. Aside from the phantom being truly terrible in all ways, including voice, I was disappointed about the lack of mystery. I hated the way Joel Schumacher assumed we wanted to see how the phantom made all his  magic tricks happen. It ruins the mystery and mystique of the whole film. In the musical, we don't know how the chandelier fell, it was magic. We were stunned when Carlotta couldn't sing, it was magic. We were astonished when the piano started playing by itself, it was magic. Schumacher has wanted so much to make this character a sympathetic figure that he has lost its mystery and its magic.  <br /> <br />I was all for casting the great Michael Crawford as the phantom. Besides having an amazing voice, he would be about the right age, according to the book. Leroux implies that the phantom is an older man, so it would work. Instead, Schumacher casts this loser who sounds like a mixture between a dying cat and the backstreet boys. Terrible, absolutely terrible.  <br />Schumacher did a few other things wrong too. The phantom was not ugly in the movie! I didn't understand it. He was supposed to be so hideously deformed that his mother would scream when she saw him, but now he looks like he just has a swollen eye! Come on, use the stage makeup, it's better. <br /> <br />But I digress. I'm recommeding the DVD because there's a very interesting documentary about the making of the show. And some parts of the movie are pretty cool. The first and last parts, namely, and some of the parts behind the scenes in the opera house were very interesting. I hated how they ruined Masquerade, first by making the costumes all black and white, thenby trying to impersonate Titanic with the upper and lower classes celebrating, and lastly, but most importantly, by changing the costume of the phantom. I loved that stage costume with the skull mask, and I'm not the only one. Oh well. <br /> <br />All in all, a good effort. But if you want a phantom, don't listen to Gerald Butler. Turn off the sound and watch the movie, but play Michael Crawford in the background. Butler's \\"singing to bring down the chandelier.\\" Michael Crawford will save you from a headache.
B0002O0CM0|5.0|I had been looking for these releases on CD for years. I finally found my old LPs and ended up using Musicmatch Plus to record them to MP3. Fortunately both LPs were in good enough shape. Are they the \\"real Doors\\"? A lot of people who regard Morrison as the early-day prophet of punk will tell you hell no--this bunch is a blues band along the lines of the lighter side of the Stones. But you know, they were doing a blues-based sound even as early as \\"Morrison Hotel\\" which continued into \\"L.A. Woman\\". Apparently Manzarek's blues leanings were beginning to rub off on Morrison even back then. The leadoff song here (\\"In the Eye Of the Sun\\") even sounds like Morrison helped write it but didn't live long enough to record it. And anyone who really listened to more than hits compilations (with the younger generation, who knows?) knows what Ray Manzarek sounds like at the mike. Witness the Willie Dixon classic \\"You Need Meat\\" on the B-side of the single \\"Wishful Sinful\\". Or another Dixon number on the \\"Absolutely Live\\" release: \\"Close To You\\". Not to mention a gig in Paris when Morrison was too smashed to go on that night, resulting in the very trio you have on this album playing that show, with Ray doing a fairly adequate Morrison imitation. As for Robby, his song \\"Variety Is the Spice Of Life\\" is a very witty number in the Randy Newman vein about infidelity and the divorce court. Okay, you don't get Morrison's bottomless rage here, born of a dysfunctional upbringing, but didn't that very anger give him an equally bottomless contempt for his own fans? Not to mention make him an abusive husband? But what you do get is the other element of the Doors that quasi-punks could care less about--superb muscianship from an outfit that uses rudimentary gear to produce it. Progressive-quality keyboard work with a cheesy compact organ while everybody else who played like that needed at least a Hammond B-3. Guitar work in both C and bottleneck done skillfully and tastefully when everyone else but Bonnie Raitt who does bottleneck vamps the style very pretentiously (i.e. George Thorogood). The Lizard King is dead, long live his \\"knights\\".lse but Bonnie Raitt who does bottleneck vamps the style very pretentiously (i.e. George Thorogood).

B0007Y08IS|4.0|Team America is one of the funniest movies I've seen in this millenium; it is also one of the most disgusting.  To give you an idea of the type of humor, it's fair to compare it to Mike Myer's Austin Powers movies.  If you liked Austin Powers, you'll probably like Team America, but it's not for kids or seniors - or normal people.  It has about an order of magnitude more filthy language and sexual humor, not just inuendo.  Yes, much of the humor is sophomoric (perverse and repulsive), but there is also much very funny satire, and the whole thing is ridiculous because they're just puppets, and that made me and the whole audience laugh as much as anything.  Much has been written about the film being homophobic; that's just nonsense, propaganda put out by Hollywood types who are offended by the very funny satire poking fun (violently) at the puppet versions of their friends Alec Baldwin, Susan Sarandon, Matt Damon and others.  The movie also lampoons right-wing secret government agencies, and the whole homophobic thing is about homosexual acts of the head of the agency - to me it seemed pro-gay.  At any rate, the movie's offensive to everyone, and if you can stomach it, it's a riot.
1563898586|2.0|Wow! Did I really say that?  Yes!  I did. <br /> <br />First my bias: I am an avid reader and value the story value above all other attributes.  On this measure, LEG vol. 1&2 both let me down.  The story value just isn't there.  The movie did a much better job.  How often do you hear of that happening? <br /> <br />I also used to love my comic books.  I read and reread them as a young teen.  I loved the stories, artwork and the flights of what-if imagination that some of the art/stories took me on and the combination of story and art really drew me into the experience.  I loved it. <br /> <br />On this measure, LEG vol. 1 & 2 also let me down.  Moore does a good job, I guess, of following the current dark flat-ish style of drawing that seems so pervasive.  Sorry, but this uninspiring style is part of what drove me away from graphic novels and killed most of the pleasure of reading the work.  In a word, the style is depressing.  <br /> <br />Finally, I was hoping to use these graphic novels to introduce my children to one of the reading experiences I so enjoyed as a teen.  I bought both the novels and the companion books, read them once and am now looking for a buyer.  Not only do I not want my kids reading LEG, I don't even want to own the works.  There is plenty of good stuff to read without driving my teens to the darker side of life that runs so thick in the story and art of the LEG works. <br /> <br />If you absolutely want to try the LEG experience, go see the movie and stop there.  The basic theme is there and is well done.  If the graphic novel is a must for you - try only vol. 1.  The sex and graphic immorality level was barely tolerable in vol. 1 and rises painfully in vol. 2.  Volume 2 meets the pornographic and offensive standards. <br /> <br />I know that I'm a minority opinion here, but I'm sorry I bought this set.  No need for you to make the same mistake. <br />
B00005JMJG|2.0|What would it be like to have one's memories erased?  Hasn't this concept been beaten to death by at least a dozen films in recent years?  This flick is dull, dark, and often stupid (see Kirsten Dunst's role for illustration).  Carrey's talents are not suited for a serious movie, and I kept expecting him to just start making those silly faces that propelled him to stardom.  He did reach a new level in his abilities to annoy the heck out of me.<br /><br />Kate Winslet is the only saving grace here.  How does she manage to make something out of this largely thankless role is a mystery.  The point is that she does -- she's very convincing and interesting to watch.  Therefore, I gave it 2 stars.
B00082IJ08|5.0|these guys know how to jam! I don't even listen to rap or r&b, but this cd was awesome. I don't even consider it rap. El Manana sounds like a french/italian classical song. Feel Good Inc has a Fatboy Slim sound. These guys are in a whole genre by themselves.  All the tunes are catchy and great. I ended up buying the Deltron 3030 cd too...This cd made The Gorillaz my new favorite band.
B00003CXDB|4.0|Wall Street is so 1980s and that's not a bad thing!!<br /><br />Michael Douglas IS Gordon Gecko in this film and that's probably why he walked off with the Oscar for Best Actor at the 1988 Academy Awards in this fascinating look at the high pressure world of the stock market.<br /><br />While Charlie Sheen was the hot commodity at the time this film was made, his acting hasn't aged well and it's quite clear that a better choice could have been found for this movie, where the same thing can be said for Darryl Hannah who is only slightly better in her role as the high priced artist for sale to the highest bidder (richest boytoy she can find).<br /><br />Oliver Stone's directing is very good but the backstory relating to BlueStar airlines could have been a little better but perhaps I just don't have very positive memories because of the trite acting by Charlie Sheen.<br /><br />However, Michael Douglas alone is worth watching this film and its the performance of his career.<br /><br />**** RECOMMENDED
0783225792|5.0|Without deniro and pesci this film would not have worked. Their characters absent in a mob movie is like a gun without bullets. I can watch this movie over and over and still be entertained and inrtigued. I think Joe Pesci did a way better job in Casino than he did in goodfellas because even though both characters are ruthless, casino \\"nicky\\" had a softer side than tommy in goodfellas. Sharon Stone cheese and rice, gave an oscar winning performance as deniro's wife who pretty much has a breakdown and turns into an addict, alcoholioc, and raving lunatic. Wouldnt you if you married to a controlling richie who has mob ties. She was gorgeous at the beginning with her long blonde hair, and 70's outfits and hair do. But of course as her character changed into an alcy and addict she lost her looks a little. Just a little reminder of what alcohol and drugs do to your body. And Robert Deniro was smoking hot! This was one of his last movies where he still looked great for his age. He is older now, but still looks pretty good. He's one of those guys that never loses his sex appeal.
B0000AGWJ7|5.0|I got this cd a while back and loved it, still do. But there isnt any explicit content......... It has to cuss words in it or anyting i dont get it
0385720920|5.0|I absolutely loved this book. It's the first by Palahniuk I ever read, and it's my favorite. After this, I read Fight Club and Survivor, but this is definately better. I know Palahniuk fans think it's blasphame to not hold Fight Club as the height of his success, but I really liked THIS one. <br /> <br />It's the first book I've ever read that held my interest the entire way through. And that's coming from some one who zones out a lot in books. The way I was able to pay attention to it makes me wish I could write this engaging! <br /> <br />WHen you read the premise for the story, it doesn't sound as action oriented as Chuck's other books, or even very interesting at ALL, but i PROMISE you, this book is worth it.  <br /> <br />The Chapters are all short. You will read one, then another, then another, wanting to know just a little bit more till you've read 150 pages in one sitting! I read this late at night on my lunch-breaks at work, and was late clocking back in on more than one occasion! <br /> <br />The writing style is like a first person, present tense narrative. There are a lot of one sentence paragraphs. The sentences are short and declerative but get the point across with a fast punch. Palahniuk said he wanted to write books that compete with modern television and videogames, and he does. Television was nothing compared to this book.  <br />The chapters are all like short stories in and of themselves. You could read one chapter in the middle, not know what's going on, and then enjoy it the same. That's just how good the book is. <br /> <br />As far as the plot and characters, it's a hilarious book that deals with many different aspects of society, through the eyes of a sex-addict con-man. His relationship with his roomate is familiar. HIs relationship with his mother is bizarre (by the way, the way he deals with people in old-folks home where his mother lives is not to miss).  <br />This is a book that's set in a world that mocks our world. It's not our world. That's what's so fun about it. And you will be going chapter to chapter wanting to know what crazy things the narrator will say or vent on next, or how he will act in certain crazy situations. <br />Note, this book has sexual content in it. But as with Chuck's other books, the even the sexual content seems to be tongue-in-cheek, like it's all something silly in this unnatural world.  <br /> <br />So if you want a fresh original book with a venting and funny narrator, a roomate that collects rocks to stop gratifying himself, a crazy mother in a nursing home full of crazy people, a strange plot involving a weird origon of the lead characters birth, than read this highly entertaining story.
B00012FXAE|5.0|Folks, this is what movies are supposed to be like.<br /><br />James Cameron took the reigns of a sequel to an amazing film by Ridley Scott (Alien, 1979) and quite possibly made an even better (albeit different) film.<br /><br />I cannot say enough about this movie as it's quite possibly my favorite film of all time.  Sigorney Weaver was outright ROBBED when she was denied the Best Actress for this movie, and it's probably due to the fact that the Academy doesn't like the science fiction genre.  If this was a drama and Sigorney gave the same type of performance she would probably have a gold statue on her mantel right now.<br /><br />If you want science fiction, action, drama, suspense, comedy (a little) and to learn how a film SHOULD be made, this is the quintessential juggernaut of motion picture making.<br /><br />****** HIGHEST POSSIBLE RECOMMENDATION
B000003AEB|5.0|This CD is so awesome.  The main reason I bought it was because I read all of these reviews and everybody else loves this cd.  It really is Classic.  This is my best Snoop cd and I have almost all of his cds.  I like all of the songs and I think any rap or music fan should own this.  I really like That Shiznit, Whats my name, Murder was the case, and all of the other ones.  If you liked The Chronic by Dre, you will love this.  5 stars.
0066214122|4.0|As per usual, Michael Crichton takes a top that he is currently interested in (nanotechnology in this case) and weaves an entertaining story around this central theme.  Better than Crichton's last book (Timeline), I quickly got through this story and wasn't disappointed in the slightest bit.<br /><br />For all Michael Crichton fans I would recommend \\"Prey\\" and I think you would find it a good, albeit light read.  If for nothing else, Crichton's meticulous research into the field of nanotechnology is worth the price of admission alone and the backstory is better than I expected it to be.<br /><br />**** RECOMMENDED
0375507256|5.0|So you've probably already read about how David Mitchell's \\"Cloud Atlas\\" has a unique structure of six mostly independent stories arranged like an onion; that is, the first and last chapters comprise the first narrative, the second and second-to-last comprise the second narrative, and so on.  I mostly approve of this device, and it is somewhat compelling when each narrative makes an appearance in its successor -- e.g. the first chapter is the first half of a journal, which is found by a character in the second chapter, and so on through to the sixth story.  Occasionally I thought \\"He is trying too hard to tie the stories together\\", but generally the device serves to enhance the excitement of each story, as each one is interrupted at a cliffhanger point to enter the next layer of the onion.<br /><br />The stories are tied together in another way as well: they all examine how man exerts his power over other men.  This ranges from the large scale (wide-scale extermination) to small (the imprisonment of a single person).  This theme is presented quite effectively, I think, although there are a few unsubtle points where characters stop in the middle of the story to hold forth on will-to-power and the inherent savagery of mankind.  Mitchell also baldly presents a negative view of corporations and capitalism that is rather more pessimistic than mine.  Aside from these bits of authorial pontificating, the writing is very enjoyable and the repetition over the main theme does lead the reader towards some profound thinking about society's power relationships.<br /><br />Each story is not only written in a different location and time period, but also with a different voice and using different language.  I thought it was pretty cool that the two narratives set in the future used new slang words.  The inventiveness of the plots and the confidence with which the author inhabits different personalities are striking.  All in all, it's a crackerjack of a book, enjoyable at both the thriller level and as an examination of the innate cruelty in men's hearts.he thriller level and as an examination of the innate cruelty in men's hearts.
B00063MBU8|4.0|Simple Plan is yet another revivalist of punk.  The positive thing about Simple Plan is the fact that they stick true to their punk roots despite the trend of the resurgence of new wave and a sudden interest in less mainstream rock aka indie-rock.  They are your typical \\"punks\\" and this album is no different.  It is a straightforward punk album.<br /><br />Again, just like Good Charlotte's album this is a very credible piece of work, yet not as credible as Green Day's 2004 masterpiece AMERICAN IDIOT.  In ways, this album trumps Good Charlotte's effort where hits are concerned.  This album is repetitive, maybe too much at times, but it appeals more in the fact that you can sing along to the catchy, repetitive choruses.<br /><br />The top song picks are \\"Shut Up\\", \\"Welcome To My Life\\", \\"Crazy\\", and \\"Jump\\".  The biggest complaint I have about this album is that it is too guitar-assertive.  That is where punk counterparts Good Charlotte trump them.  At times, the \\"punk\\" is just too heavy with bursting guitars.  Overall, if you are looking for traditionalist punk as compared to more refined punk (Green Day), then Simple Plan is the way to go.  3.5 stars.
B00005YUPO|1.0|I like and own other Baby Einstein DVDs.  The quality of production is missing in Baby Bach.  The segments do not seem themed (as in the other DVDs).  In fact it is annoying random as if it was just slapped together.  There is too much of a reliance on still shots rather than moving ones that work with the music. <br /> <br />And her kids are annoying at this point.  I got the feeling they were being marketed to us as Adorable Kids.  Too much.
B0007Y08IS|3.0|This is by no means a bad movie. While this has a pretty decent storyline, it is too silly in some respects to be considered a credible movie.  Furthermore, there is a bit too much offensive material to make this movie accessible to everyone.  It is true that someone will most likely always be offended by some movie, but this movie carries it just a bit to the excess.  What makes the offensiveness worse is the fact that this is a movie that stars puppets.  It isn't even real characters.  When you associate puppets and cartoons, you see them as fictional characters living ultimately in a very fictional world.  Therefore seeing puppets in a real atmosphere doing human things makes this movie unbelievable to some extent. Of course, it is important to remember this movie was created by Trey Parker, the same person responsible for the incredibly risque SOUTH PARK, which also takes cartoons to never before experienced teritorry with excess of sexuality, cussing, and etc.<br /><br />This movie aims itself towards teens naturally because adults aren't going to be into puppets yet with its raucious themality (esp. an over-explicit sex scene), it isn't for younger children. It is an odd situation.  The story line, anybody has to admit, is somewhat funny, though a bit over the top.  Again, an enjoyable movie, if you can ignore the explicit themality, which alas, is a difficult task.
B000002KHH|5.0|If your prepared to Ignore, what is quite possibly, one of the worst rock album covers in recent years. Then you'll not only find one of the greatest heavy Metal albums money can buy, but also finding Black Sabbath at the height of their musical powers. The album opens with the truly epic \\"War Pigs\\" which laments the governmental powers, which use military warfare as a means of controlling power. The propulsive crunching guitar and percussive drumming, paint a wholly dramatic apocalyptic musical landspace over which Ozzy extols the dire consequences in a bleak and Gloomy vocal delivery, in a song that is so convincingly complete, that this song would be covered by over artists (such as \\"Faith no more\\").  <br />  <br />\\"Paranoid\\" was one of the very first track Black Sabbath tracks that I was actually introduced to (Via a various artists compilation), and was the track to fuel my interest in Black Sabbath, and remains one of (the many) highlights on this admittedly short album. but the combination of minor-key dirges loosely based around (or indeed on) a heavy blues-rock template, give their sound more gravitas, and the sense of lyrical confusion & paranoia in this track only serves to highten the considerable tension, which is based around severe feelings of alienation & insecurity.  <br />  <br />\\"Iron Man\\" has to be quite possibly, one of the finest & easily identifiable guitar riffs in many years. Undoubtedly one of the strongest tracks on the album, that although will always be remembered for its primary & monolithic guitar/Drum dynamic, also finds favour by being relentlessly dark & Dramatic. Ozzy's uncluttered vocals, which rather than crowd the song out with unnecessary chorus or lyrics, eases back on the tales of supernatural/sci-fi horrors, and allows the musicians to truly be in their element, by cooking up monstrous riffs, and complex drum rhythms that are not only crushingly loud, they touch on approaching superbly crafted Jams.  <br />  <br />\\"Rat Salad\\" is a rock instrumental that due to my fondness for instrumental music (its nice to hear if the music is built on a solid instrumental foundation) quickly found a place in my heart. Due to it not only being a incredibly tightly constructed piece of Heavy Instrumental Rock, but also with the Drum Solos, that frequently interject, and the technical virtuosity of the freewheeling guitar that frequently hint at funk/Blues, in a fiery electrified outburst invoking the odd nod to \\"Led Zeppelin\\" in their exuberance & Sprawling excess, and just like Led Zep, are able to produce a series of staggering riffs, that would go on to define the band.  <br />  <br />If you are a causal listener to Black Sabbath (like myself), then (along with \\"Master of Reality\\" this, is the best starting point for their music. It's a touchstone album for the band, insofar as it was the album that truly broke out of the niche market, and thrust the band to a wider audience, and is a generally consistent album with no filler tracks (at 8 tracks, you'd hope not), and whether or not this album or \\"Master of reality\\" is their best album isn't really the point of this review.....the point I'm trying to make is that not only is this one of the finest (if not the finest) moment, of the bands recorded history, but also is arguably one of the greatest heavy metal albums ever.
0689865384|5.0|This book was really amazing.  I loved the way Tally changed and the way she learned the truth about being 'pretty'.  The way he intertwined 'history' and his new world of technology really intrigued me.  I loved the way the relationship evolved with David and Tally.  Tally becomes a victim in more ways than one from more than one person.  She is corned b the end of the book, and the ending(wow!) truely left me breathless. I CANNOT wait until november for the sequel, PRETTIES.
B0007LXPBI|5.0|This movie was pretty cool Lindsay is an awsome actress! <br />I have this movie on VHS but i think i need to get this DVD this will have bonus material thats why i want it on DVD!more Lindsay! i'm glad there rereleaseing this movie cant wait to get Tomorrow!! most have DVD!
B00004T9UH|1.0|This isn't what its hyped up to be.. just like fem himself. A 4 year old bad mouthed kid could do better than this. 1 star is too much.
0393035158|4.0|The only thing I didn't like in this book was that about 1/3 of the book is footnotes and I found myself flipping back and forth between them as I read the book - I wish the author had found a way to integrate them into the text or something. <br /> <br />This book takes a good look at the 2 main religions, Islam and Christianity, and points out how they are both rather angry and destructive in many of their core writings. Lots of detractors of this book have written that it was in fact atheists who were responsible for the biggest genocide of the last century. As true as that is, that alone does not give religion a free ride for causing many other murderous activities throughout our existence.  And okay, yes, some religion has managed to do some good things (some claim the anti-slavery movement was largely Christian). But only in spite of itself (ie.. priests molesting altar boys, degradation and control of women, TV evangelism $$$, suppression of science, endless destruction of 3rd world cultures to be replaced by the \\"one true god\\", etc...). And don't think for a moment that all the slaveholders weren't going to church every Sunday too. <br /> <br />I'm really shocked at some of the reviewers writing that Sam Harris is essentially advocating the genocide of all Muslims. I have no idea where they found that in this book. That is not the case at all. He is asking, hoping really, that everyone in the world will come to their damn senses and start relinquishing faith on their own free will, generation by generation. Start now! Stop sending your kids to friggin' Sunday School. <br /> <br />I think the time has come in the US (and the world) to take a long hard look at where we want to go as a nation. The right-wing christian influence over the current administration is disturbing in every way. This president is on a \\"mission from God\\" and Iraq is only step 1.   <br />
B0006GVJEE|5.0|And that's almost how this movie goes:  Just because Leon is a professional killer, doesn't mean he's cold hearted.  This movie just cleverly blended in some intense action with a warm hearted bond.<br /><br />Leon(Jean Reno) is the bad-@$$ that is a pro, and has been killing since the age of 19.  Looking at his apperence, it looks lke he's been doing this for a real long time.  But his life of living lonley, blasting for cash, and feeding his house plant(And aw man, he loves his house plant) were about to be turned around when a 12 year old girl(Natalie Portman) comes into his life after her family gets massacared by a crazy dirty federal agent(Gary Oldman), and when he takes his medcian, man he's out of this world.  I'm serious, once he starts humming to Beethoven, RUN!  It doesn't matter where to, get the fudge away from him!<br /><br />After the opening action sceenes, you see the heart of this film paulse like crazy.  The connection between Leon and Matilida is just heartwarming.  When I saw the uncut version I realized alot of stuff changed, like Leon insted of being a father figure, is somewhat that and a lover.  I was kinda freaked, cuz a 40-50 year old guy, and a 12 year old girl?!  It just ain't right, but this is still the main backbone of the movie.<br /><br />Leon definitly stapled Jean Reno on the map, and opened up alot of oppurtunities for future stars.  This movie has a bit of violence, and one great ending, I'm tellin' you, Leon definitly goes out with a bang.  Anyone who likes Reno, Action flicks, or movies for that matter, GET THIS!  To me, this, in many ways, reminds me of Ico(PS2)  by dragging me in it's world emotionaly.  To me, right next to Shawshank Redemption, this is the greatest movie ever made.<br /><br />Peace
B00005JNBQ|1.0|There is nothing to redeem this pathetic excuse for a movie.  IT IS NOT FUNNY AT ALL. What is so funny about a faceless non identity saying \\"idiot!\\".  What is so funny about a boy putting tator tots in his pocket and a bully smashing them.  ***Sample dialogue: Bully:\\"Gimme some of your tator tots\\"  Napoleon: \\"No, i didn't eat anything for lunch\\"  The bully kicks Napoleon in the leg.  Napoleon: \\"Idiot\\"  End of dialogue and scene***  This movie has no flow or consistency whatsoever in the script.  It's a bunch of bits and pieces glued together resembling a plotless fiasco.  A loser with ZERO personality who can't even hold a REAL conversation with someone is bullied in school then he finds a hispanic who becomes a friend.  This hispanic runs for class president against the upper class snob and so on...  This story is cliched and has been done before but successfully with REAL dialogue and not just stupid empty headed one line responses.  This story has been done before with real funny sketches and jokes and characters that can carry a decent structured dialogue between each other.  I mean what is this world coming to when they think that empty headed brainless scripts like this is something to celebrate.  There's absolutely NOTHING original or likable about this unless you are braindead like the characters in this film.  This makes \\"Revenge of the nerds\\" seem like a masterpiece.  I guess when you listen to the garbage that people pass for music today i can understand the decline of the intellect of our society.  How SAD.  You want a great comedy with outcasts that have something really funny to offer than get \\"Animal House\\" or anything else than this.      Not word for word Sample from Movie but close enough: Pedro-\\"Is it hot in here\\"  Napoleon: \\"No,i don't think so\\"  Pedro: \\"Are you sure it's not hot in here\\"  Napoleon:\\"Yeah\\"  Pedro:\\"Well i'm going home to rest\\"  Napoleon: \\"Okay\\"      End of scene.     OH BOY IS THIS A FUNNY MOVIE!!!! What a witty script!!!   NOT!!!!!  WHAT THE !!!*
B000050FEN|5.0|What i like about seven is the atmosphere. Everything in the film seems to sag under an invisible blanket of misery and grime which projects an imagery that is quintessentially urbane. The two main actors give splendid performances as the hard minded detectives. Pitt is in moody form as the angry young detective, struggling to find some goodness in his life through his devotion to his pregnant wife, Freeman's character has long since given up on the light, he is weighed down by the horrors his job has exposed him to. Either of the two detectives could testify as a truthful guide to the miserable and cruel world they occupy. Spacey in this movie is spaced out, so completely does he dissolve into the shell of the deranged self-guided prophet cum serial killer. <br /> <br />The plot of Seven is really quite simple, so simple that between the pregnant beginning (pun intended) and the stunning perfect twist at the end the director finds himself with a lot of space to fill, so this is filled up with the hunt for the killer and the detectives travel on a gruesome trip through varying interesting forms of sadism, savagery and sheer horror as they follow the killer through his victims - all seemingly normal people who's transgression of one of the seven deadly sins is the  killers professed motive for killing them. The sheer shock value of the murders themselves easily differentiates this film from others of it's genre, the director truly was pushing the envelope in terms of horror. The ending of this film...is legend, simply put it is probably the finest neatest ending i have ever seen, because of it's power to haunt and seize the imagination of the viewer, it guarantees that once seen the film will not be forgotten.  <br /> <br />Seven could serve as a prophecy of things to come, today religious nuttiness is making a comeback, and everyone seems to be generally more desensitised to suffering and cruelty compared to say - forty years ago. <br /> <br />I actually give this film 4.5 out of 5 (because the motive for the murders stretched the bounds of credibility a bit and the films constant hammering of it's negative message is ultimately a little oppressive,and character development could have gone further - these are interesting characters!). One of the best thrillers of the last 15 years, no doubt.
B00005JNBQ|3.0|While I was watching this movie I thought to myself...\\"Why does everyone love this movie? There is absolutely no point to it!!\\" Seriously, no real plot at all. Then the next day I was talking with some friends about the movie. They thought the same thing I did - Why is everyone soooo crazy about this movie? While talking about it we found ourselves quoting movie lines and laughing our butts off. My final verdict - you need to watch this movie with friends and moe than once to get sucked into Napolean's world. But I still have more fun quoting the lines han watching the actual move!
B0006FFRW0|5.0|Nine Inch Nails is such a great band, and this cd proves it. Trent Reznor is a genius with out a doubt. He has talent and isn't afride to say whatever he wants to say. He may be \\"dirty\\" at times..*coughcough*closer*coughcough*. But atleast he has balls to say what he wants to say, and acually gets out what he wants people to hear.
B00097DX3U|5.0|Another fantastic album by Audioslave, When I first heard Your Time Has Come, I thought Oh Dear God theve screwed it all up, But as soon as it ended I found I was hooked, All the tracks, The Worm, Be Yourself, Dandelion, Out Of Exile, list goes on, didnt actually want to write a full blown review just wanted to mention Yesterday To Tommorow, Dont think anybodys mentioned that yet....Cracking what a bloody tune! Solo kicks ass, All his solo's does, The Worms solo is just Morello all over! WICKED WICKED WICKED!
B0001UL7RY|1.0|Okay there are good reviews and then there are bad reviews..I'm going to give you a bad review with Ms. Avril here. First off the girl is a bit annoying if you will. She is rude to her fans, she calls herself things that arn't true, and have you ever seen this girl on a skateboard other then in her videos? She needs to change her attitude or prove some things, and not just flip off the camera and wear a tutu with combat boots. She is the reason we have one of the worst word in the history of time today: \\"The poser\\". She practly made that a house hold saying...and it's not something a real \\"punk\\" would say. Now on to her music. She's a bit...let's say whiney. She's way to pop punk for her own good. Anyway...I guess I don't know alot about her music other then I dislike it. But to all the Avril fans out there...more power to you..I prolly wouldn't beable to stand an idol that was rude to me for dressing like her and acually liking her. So demand some respect from her Avrilfans! Do something!
B00097A5I6|2.0|Right first of all, All Oasis albums are gr8! not one! have they done where I couldnt listen to it all the way through! But this one is the first Im ashamed to say, Jo Whiley from Radio 1 sed summit along the lines of this album going back to the days of Definitely Maybe, she was well & truly wrong!!! no songs like live forever, Its an awful album from Oasis....but still good as it's Oasis that have done it lol, Their all ok in their own way: Turn up the sun is slightly travisy, MUCKY FINGERS is a fantastic tune that will get atleast one part of your anatomy moving, (moving on) Guess God Thinks Im Abel is awful! An absolute copy of The Music's - Bleed From Within! Not saying any more bout that! Track 12 - I Can See It Now IS THE BEST ON HERE BY FAR, Quality riff! Really good, Let there Be Love is alright but heard it years ago on a bootlegged B-Sides CD, So no suprises there, only difference is that Noel Sang on the B-Side, Not really gonna mention Lyla as it's the first single....gr8 tune.  <br />Overall 2 stars if that! A big shame that they released an album of B-Sides.
B00004U8P9|5.0|Rocky Horror Picture Show is one of the most..interesting peices of art in our time. When I first saw this movie..I was pretty young, and I was shocked at what I was watching. It was..dirty. What this movie/musical is about is this couple of a small town decide to get married and they want to go see and tell the news to the professor they had togeather, but along the way they get stuck and they have to go to this dark gloomy castle where they find out a party is being held. You get to meet these very unique charaters that are from outerspace and one sweet transvestite who creats a extreamly hott creature. Whenever this musical is plaied in theaters people dress up as the charaters and sing and dance along. People with open minds should deffently see this movie. Some great and random music is in here...like the timewarp which you won't beable to stop dancing to for a while.
B000000OQ5|5.0|Mechanical Resonance is absolutely fantastic and it deserves so much more credit that it is getting. Actually Tesla deserves so much more credit altogether, but they are terrific in my eyes and songs like EZ Come EZ Go, Cumin' Atcha Live, Modern Day Comboy, 2 Late for Love, Changes, and Gettin' Better are awesome. I'm glad Tesla are back and I hope one day they come out with that one album that will make them superstars!
B000002KIE|5.0|The Sex Pistols...one of the greatest bands of all time. One of my favoret. You can pick Sid Vicious's voice out of ANYWHERE. It's so angery and revolting. This is what punk was and should have staied that way. The music on this album is so amazing. It has God Save the Queen, E.M.I., and of course Anarchy in the U.K. This is the ranchiest most rebeling agenst goverment album that I have heard out there. England produces such great bands...and this is proof.
B00006WUWN|1.0|I thought the first Austin Powers was funnier than heck, but this one is just plain stupid. Rude and crude take the place of clever and witty. I've seen it three times and am still waiting for the funny parts...
068987474X|4.0|The title of the book sounds harsh, but it is meant to be empowering for women, stuck in the rut of making excuses for men who just aren't into them. It tells the women to wake up and find someone who truly cares about them and will pursue them. Also lots of laughs and makes for fun, easy reading!
B0001GOH6Q|5.0|Big Fish is one of Tim Burton's films that doesn't leave you depressed and struggling to find a dry hanky. What it will leave you with is a feel-good feeling while you'll be searching for a clean hanky.<br /><br />Better known for his oddly different movies such as Edward scissorhands, and sleepy hollow, Tim Burton has constructed a movie that seems impossibly fairy-tale like in its intense beauty of story telling and lush settings, while still keeping the draber side of the story (reality) enthralling.<br /><br />Williem Bloom (Billy Crudup) is a man who grew up with his storytelling father, (Albert Finney, Ewan McGregor) who always seemed to have wonderful exciting things happening to him. Even if they seemed to wild to believe, Edward manages to make them truly real. However children cannot stay young always, and finally Will grows up to despise his fathers storys, believing its the lies of a man who is has been discontent with his life and family. Lies he has invented to soothe himself that his life didn't turn out the particulare way he wanted. The people he has met, the things he has done never happened, only in his imagination that is. People alive only in the reality of his father dillusional mind<br /><br />Unable to listen to his father any longer, he tells him that he justs wants to know the real him. \\"But I've told you!\\" Edward replies, \\" You just haven't been listening.\\" So begins the journey through the fantastic mind of one man who believed the world was designed to be lived to  the fullest. He was the master of his destiny and death was just yet another adventure to be looked forward to.<br /><br />The end is the best part of the fairy tale, when Edward is dying and tells William to tell how he dies. Coming from a man who has spent his life polishing his life up, it is his son's turn to follow his footsteps. Follow Will does, turning his fathers death into one of the most touching part of all the previous stories told. Even in the realm of fantasy there is reality, which is proven by his fathers actual funeral when mostly all of what the son has told his father happens in the reality realm. Not as colorful of fantastic, but just as wonderful.<br /><br />Tim Burton strikes again, with yet another movie that will leave feeling as though life is truly as beautiful as portrayed here. One must only be ready to open their eyes to the truththere is reality, which is proven by his fathers actual funeral when mostly all of what the son has told his father happens in the reality realm. Not as colorful of fantastic, but just as wonderful. <br /> <br />Tim Burton strikes again, with yet another movie that will leave feeling as though life is truly as beautiful as portrayed here. One must only be ready to open their eyes to the truth
B00082IJ08|4.0|This album has grown and grown on me. I wanted to write about the first six proper songs forming the heart of the album and the rest being disposable, but it's really not true. Every track has something interesting to offer. Funky beats, weird minor keys, little accents here and there. You have to appreciate the perspective of the creators of this album, the supremely playful and simultaneously world weary affect of pop veterans, who have seen it all and yet still want to mess with the form and function of their music. This is the work of an artist at the height of his powers who respects his audience. I can appreciate how people might listen to this and go WTF? But give it a chance. For every excess there's a hidden gem.
B00004ZD69|5.0|yeah. This isn't something you can just throw in and chill out to. This album is like experiencing a movie only with your ears. It's this dark tale that keeps winding on and on... it's intense. this CD is a must have for anyone who can appreciate any kind of art that goes against the norm. <br /> <br />If you're willing to take the journey, buy the album... you won't regret it.
0345440900|1.0|If you intend to breastfeed, you should be warned that following the feeding advice given in this book could cause you to have serious problems with your milk supply.  The author is openly against feeding on demand, even for newborns, and recommends that mothers start to space feedings out and offer only pacifiers between scheduled feedings when the baby is only one day old.    Breastfeeding is designed by nature to be an on-demand system, and a mother's milk supply is stimulated by a newborn's desire to nurse frequently.  Forcing a newborn to space out breast feedings short-circuits nature's system for establishing a mother's milk supply, and this can lead to a serious supply shortage.  Another reason not to follow any breastfeeding advice from this author is that she does not seem to believe that breastfeeding offers any significant advantages over formula feeding, and leans heavily toward formula supplementation frequently being necessary...these are red flags that this person is neither supportive or knowledgeable about breastfeeding, and her advice is suspect.   There may be some value in her recommendation to follow a routine of wake up, eat, do some activity, then sleep, and to have a consistent daily routine in a baby's environment.   But her breastfeeding advice may be harmful, and her bias against ever sharing sleep with your baby both go against how nature intended babies to be cared for.  As alternatives to this book, I recommend The Baby Book by Sears, The No-Cry Sleep Solution by Pantley, Good Nights by Gordon, and Baby Matters by Palmer.
B0001Z52RU|3.0|The idea of 'The Butterfly Effects' sounds unique, but actually it is a more violent and unnerving version of Ray Bradbury's 'A Sound of Thunder' (which was filmed in 2003 with the director Peter Hyams, but of which release is much delayed).  For all its overwrought script, 'The Butterfly Effect' remains intriging all through, with the time paradox idea twisted and turned countless times. <br /> <br />Ashton Kutcher (not so bad playing a serious role) is Evan, who as a little boy experiences sudden memory losses.  Whenever it happens, something terrible has happened around him, but the boy does not remember the truths while, as the film implies, the kids and adults surrounding him know, and greatly affected by, these horrible events. <br /> <br />[IF YOU CAN CHANGE THE PAST...] Grown-up and in college, Evan is now a brilliant student majoring in psychology.  But one day he finds he has special ability to 'go back' to the certain point of the past, and 'see' the incidents that really happened to him.  Moreover, he realizes by interfering the events, he can change the entire course of the life of him and his girlfriend Kayleigh (excellent Amy Smart).  But the more Evan interfers, the more the history gets meddled, often with a very awful result. <br /> <br />Avid film fans would promptly point out that the central idea is a familiar one -- remember the films like 'Frequency,' 'Somewhere in Time,' 'Retroactive,' and of course, the great 'Back to the Future' trilogy.  'The Butterfly Effect,' least humorous among them, uses this time-travel concept in a way those films never did before, including the disturbing elements like murders, abusing children, prostitution, hurting animal, and so on and on.  'Donnie Darko' surely contains pretty dismal moments, but compared with this, it is a real fun movie. <br /> <br />The story of 'The Butterfly Effect' never stops, and by refusing to give us the chance to think a moment, it gives the audiences a non-stop roller-coaster ride,which changes the fate of Evan, Kaykeigh, and the others involved Evan's life in the most unpredictable fashion.  Though the ride is never boring, too many things are crammed in the script, and with less characters and incidents the film could have been better.          <br /> <br />Finally, as to Ashton Kutcher himself.  I think he did better acting than I expected, but still I could not shake off the image of him in 'Dude, Where's My Car?' and most notably, TV series 'Punk'd.'  I can understand the opinions of some reviewers saying he is unfairly treated -- I agree -- but if he really wants to be taken seriously, he should quit the hidden camera show immediately, or at least, before they start to make a sequel.

B000957O82|4.0|Date doctor Alex \\"Hitch\\" Hitchens (Will Smith) is the personification of the old adage: Those who can't, teach; and those who can't teach, teach gym. Hitch doesn't teach gym, but he gets quite a workout paving the road to romance for his clients. When it comes to his own happiness, Hitch takes the road less traveled, one filled with hilarious potholes and the occasional speed bump. <br /> <br />Speed bumps aren't enough to stop Hitch, a cheerfully zany film that shoves star Will Smith into the romantic comedy spotlight, where the former Fresh Prince seems very comfortable. Even when dark clouds of contrived plot complications arrive in the third act, Smith still shines. He's winning as a man who can seemingly fix any relationship but lacks the discipline to help himself. <br /> <br />Hitch exudes confidence as he guides New York's lonely hearts into each other's arms, taking on his biggest challenge in good natured slob Albert Brennaman (Kevin James). Overweight, shy, and lacking self-esteem, Albert not only has a big heart, but big aspirations. He is smitten with beautiful socialite Allegra Cole (Amber Valletta), who only sees Albert as one of her corporate accountants. <br /> <br />Just as Hitch embarks on his latest mission, he encounters gossip columnist Sara Melas (Eva Mendes), who totally rearranges his mental Feng Shui. It's at this juncture that Hitch reaches its potential, drawing laughs from not one but three different sets of unions: Albert and Allegra, Hitch and Sara, and funniest of all, Hitch and Albert. Watching Smith and James (The King of Queens) go through the motions is a hoot, especially when it comes to the more delicate matters of the heart. <br /> <br />Writer Kevin Bisch finds plenty of humor in the premise, and even though he uses shorthand to get the ball rolling, never shortchanges the characters or their motives. Even when the script veers towards slapstick comedy, it never feels like a cheat. Instead, the actors make these moments theirown, allowing us to embrace rather than reject the silliness. <br /> <br />When Hitch isn't being silly it's actually quite smart. The film has a lot to say about the condition of the human heart, and why someone like Hitch exists. He's slick and effective, something Hitch lacks when the tables are turned. Eva Mendes (Stuck On You) is a real sport as Sara, who literally turns the doctor into a babbling patient. Smith rarely portrays characters that lack confidence, and watching him trying to hinder Hitch's slide is quite engaging. <br /> <br />James is equally effective and sincere, making us believe not only can someone like Albert win the heart of someone like Allegra, he deserves to. Likewise, Amber Valletta equalizes the rich bitch socialite role with a sympathetic nod, turning a caricature into flesh and blood person. A lot of romantic comedies are played so broad it becomes impossible to identify with or invest in the characters. We not only like these characters, we want to see them succeed. Hitch doesn't deal with life or death situations, and it won't solve the world's problems, but as lightweight entertainment, it floats like a butterfly and stings like, well that was another Will Smith movie
B00000IFWE|5.0|There are some people who, quite sadly and unfortunatley, think aging rock stars don't have it anymore. That they should call it a day because they don't deliver the goods anymore. I can't think of anyone who fits that description, but the same can be said for the new hot acts who, let's face it, don't really deliver. Tom Petty is one of a number of rockers who are not only still out there giving us their absolute best, but he is a master craftsman and songwriter who still delivers strong, potent music as if it were still his late 70's to late 80's heyday. \\"Echo\\" is an astonishingly tight and rocking rock and roll album that proves that Petty's talent and musicianship is  still as sharp as it's ever been. I will go so far to say that this CD is his best effort since \\"Full Moon Fever\\". The majority of the album, give or take 5 songs or so, is pretty much upbeat and rocking. The first track, \\"Room At The Top\\", has that classic Petty sound, but it's a track I don't really listen too. \\"I'm A Free Girl Now\\" is one those good 'ol Petty rock stompers that has that signature sound and edge to it that makes it, undeniably, a Petty tune. \\"Lonesome Sundown\\" is a pretty ballad-y type tune that starts off with a western-y type of piano intro that sounds like you were walking through the desert with your horse. Nice tune. \\"Swingin'\\" is another track that has that slow melody to it, with that Petty drawl. I don't think there is another modern rock artist out there who can pop out very simple, quick, instantly catchy rock tunes than Petty. This disc is filled with a few of them that grab you by the ear and don't let go until it's over. \\"Accused Of Love\\" is one such track. Others that fill the bill include \\"Won't Last Long\\", with it's driving guitar intro and melody and Petty's rhythmic vocals, this track is one catchy tune. \\"I Don't Wanna Fight\\" isn't the deepest song with deep lyrics, but it has a hard rock and roll rhythm to it and that's fine by me!. \\"This One's For Me\\" is another short pop/rock tune that is pleasing to the ear but, like a previous song title, \\"won't last long\\" after you hear it. \\"About To Give Out\\" is a song that has a strong rock tune to it and a great catchy vocal workout from Petty. Another great track. \\"Billy The Kid\\" is a song that starts off with a snappy intro and quickly delves into another rock riff. It's a great track. The title tune, \\"Echo\\", is a long and slower song that sounds like vintage Tom. \\"Rhino Skin\\" is an interesting track that says you need \\"elephant balls\\". Starts off slow, but then kicks into a catchy little riff. While most of the album is a top notch winner, there are a few tracks that I could of done without. \\"One More Day, One More Night\\", and \\"No More\\" are fine tunes, but both are soft and slow and don't deliver like the rest of the album. Petty has been hailed as a rock genius and one of the few rockers who tells it like it is in straight forward rock and roll. He is still that guy, and this CD is proof positive of that. Plus, you don't really become interesting until your an aging rock star anyway. Keep it up, Tom.
B00080ZG10|3.0|I must admit up front that this wasn't a film I was excited to see in the theater (I've never been a fan of Martin Scorsese films)...but with everything I read about it, I really was shocked that it didn't win the Best Picture Oscar this year (I guess I'm not the only one who's not a fan of Scorsese). This epic film seemed to have all the ingredients that the Academy likes in their Best Picture selection, but maybe it was too much a reminder of \\"The English Patient\\" or else Hollywood doesn't think much of Howard Hughes. <br /> <br />After watching the film, I completely understand why it didn't win (though I haven't seen \\"Million Dollar Baby\\" either). Its difficult to sit through a nearly 3 hour movie where the main character is obsessive compulsive. It makes for a very uncomfortable viewing experience! The film has its moments though...particularly EVERY SCENE with Cate Blanchett as the Academy's favorite actress Katherine Hepburn. She is simply  great and marvelous in her role, well deserving of her Oscar win. In a way, I wished this film was more about her than Howard Hughes. The other scenes I liked were the flying sequences and the Senate hearings when Howard Hughes manages to overcome his eccentric phobias to defend his name and turn the tables on a very corrupt Senator, played impressively by Alan Alda. That's about it, as far as what I liked in this movie. The rest of the time as I viewed it, I couldn't help but think that maybe someone should send a copy of this movie to Michael Jackson. Maybe seeing the obsessive-compulsions of another genius and how it nearly destroyed him will serve as a wake up call to MJ...but on second thought, probably not. <br /> <br />The ending of this film I thought was weak and incomplete. I honestly don't know anything about Howard Hughes, and because this film just ends with Hughes rambling one of his repetative sentences, we don't know what happens to him, and after sitting through 3 hours of a bio-pic, it doesn't encourage me to want to learn more about the guy. I did see some similarities between the way Scorsese made this film and Orson Welles' \\"Citizen Kane\\", but if it was intentional, it was a very weak attempt to create that level of cinematic brilliance. <br /> <br />On one positive, yet unintentionally ironic note...I thought it was interesting that Leonardo DiCaprio played Howard Hughes, who helped TWA become a major competing airline to Pan Am...considering that Leonardo played a con-man who pretends to be a Pan Am pilot in Steven Spielberg's \\"Catch Me if You Can.\\" I think maybe watching this two films in a double feature might work...but with \\"The Aviator\\"...all you'll get is a lot of turbulence with only a few scenes that are truly worth seeing. It doesn't start, however, until at least 40 minutes into the movie when Cate Blanchett makes her first appearance. She makes this film worth seeing. I hope she'll play the role again if Hollywood decides to make a bio-pic on Katherine Hepburn. But if they do...get someone other than Scorsese to direct.
6305428050|4.0|There are certain movies in various stages of your life that stay with you no matter what. These movies might linger on and have a special place because of a certain time you saw them, or it just reminds you of something. It doesn't matter in any way if these movies were even any good at all. They were good to you for a special purpose, and that's what matters. This one is just one of those kinds of movies for me. While it's  far from being a classic piece of American cinema, it isn't that bad at all, and delivers 99 minutes of pure fun and silliness. I was 8 when I saw this movie, and I remember renting it many times over in the years after. I guess it just brings back fond memories of my childhood. Elisabeth Shue stars in this 1987 comedy as Chris Parker, a very popular high school student who seems to be living the teenage dream. She's pretty, popular, and is going out with a top of the line guy(West Wing's Bradley Whitford of all people). Chris' big night out with her boyfriends turns sour when he breaks their date and now her night is ruined. Or so she thinks. She accepts the job of babysitting the Anderson kids. Brad(Keith Coogan), is a dorky kinda kid with a bad 80's haircut who has a crush on Chris. Who wouldn't?. Little sister Sara(Maia Brewton) is a cute littly dynamo who's obsessed with fictional character Thor, complete with cape and viking helmet. The quiet evening at home turns into anything but when Chris' nutty best friend Brenda(Penelope Ann Miller), calls for help. Brenda is at the bus station and needs Chris to come pick her up. What seems like a simple little trek into downtown Chicago to pick up a friend turns into a nightmare. For starters, they are joined by Brad's annoying friend(played by Anthony Rapp, who went on to do \\"Rent\\" on Broadway), and to make matters worse, they get a flat tire on the freeway. From there on, it's a mad dash thru the mean streets of Chicago, coming into contact with one handed truckers, car thieves, gangs, doctors,Frat house keggers, blues singers, and a long, blonde haired Vincent D'Onofrio. I don't which is scarier. AIB is a perfect 80's movie. It fits right into the category that already includes the best of John Hughes' input(and what big 80's kid movie didn't he do?!)and a few others. One of the pluses is the cast. Shue is wonderful as Chris, a young girl who is trying desperatley to save her friend and keep her young charges out of harm's way. The kids themselves are good. They may have some typical young kid annoyances, but they are all pretty good and make it feel like they are real kids who you actually like. Penelope Ann Miller is one of the best parts here. With her big glasses, nerdy appearance, and comical misadventures of her own in the bus terminal, she delivers many of the funniest moments. There are some moments that just scream \\"Hollywood\\", like the car thief with a heart of gold, but this is just for fun. AIB is a fun and nostalgic trip back to 1987. I just heard that there are plans underway for a re-make. Hollywood, pleas leave a good thing alone.
B000006TRV|5.0|This is by far Pink Floyd's greatest album. It chronicles the life of a rock n' roll artist, Pink Floyd and his plunge into madness. This semi autobiographical album has awesome songwriting with a variety of different songs. The best songs include: <br />1. Comfortably Numb <br />2. Another Brick in the Wall Pt. 2 <br />3. Hey You <br />4. Run Like Hell <br />5. The Happiest Days of Our Lives <br />6. Waiting For the Worms <br />7. One of my Turns <br />8. Young Lust <br /> <br />A must have for any music fan! No collection is complete without it!!!!!!!!!! This is rock n' roll history!!!!
B0000028MA|3.0|<br />The movie Singles epitomizes everything wrong with trendy elitist Seattle. If this movie had been set in Nebraska, it wouldn't have caught on. But since Seattle is the Heroin capital of the country, then it's the perfet place to feature a few go-nowhere-fast kids who unsure of their future and where their next kanoodle will come from. <br /> <br />There are more imporant movie in life to see than this. And there are certainly better soundtracks to buy. <br />
B0007QJ1MK|5.0|I really cannot speak highly enough of this album. From the fast paced \\"QOTSA is back\\" introduction of Medication to the strange moment of emotion in the chorus of Tangled Up In Plaid, to the climactic end of Someone's In The Wolf, to the bluesy energy of Broken Box, and finally to the sad Long Slow Goodbye, every song breathes and has a life of its own. The album may not have Nick, but Josh, Mark, Troy and Joey more than make up for it. Most importantly, the album has groove, something that defined the music on QOTSA's previous releases, and even on the albums of QOTSA's predecessor, Kyuss. It is an excellent album very worthy of purchase - and if you get an opportunity, go see a live QOTSA show, because it is an experience to be experienced....
B0007YMUZW|5.0|Reading the reviews of the musical magazines about this cd, I was really not sure to buy Cold Roses. It was defined as \\"good, but it could be better\\". Well, I already own Gold (first album) and, for me this is really better. This is definitely an excellent work.
B000001FS3|5.0|Simply put, this is one of the best rock LP's of all time.  It's songs are both brilliant and timeless.  Bono hits his peak with lyrics while The Edge really starts to show his diversity.  This recording is one of the reasons why U2 is still alive and kicking today.  Great works like this only come along once in a while.  For even the casual U2 fan this is a no brainer.  I like to call this U2's \\"Revolver\\".  It's where the early U2 sound starts to evolve from the same old thing....and for a real treat check out U2's \\"Sgt Pepper\\" \\"Achtung Baby\\".
B0007YMUZW|5.0|If you like the contry rock of the Byrds, if you like Neil Young, if you like Tom Petty, GET THIS CD!!!!!  It is the best CD I have purchased in the last year.
B00097DX3U|4.0|I don't like to compare bands' new albums to their old albums. This album doesn't disapoint at all. In fact, I believe the band has refined and perfected it's sound. Proved to be good background music for my Memorial Day barbeque. This album shows how much Tom Morello has grown as a musician over the past 15 years...he is truly incredible on this album.
0062502182|3.0|A nice parable that was simply written but hard to put down. At the end, I was disappointed. While searching for treasure the boy learns many lessons. His journey would seem to be spiritual even though it is a \\"treasure\\" he is searching for. What disapointed me was that the treasure is monetary. Although he found many lessons along the way, his journey should have been the reward. I didn't like that he kept on until he had the gold. Another thing, because this is a simplistic tale, at times it seemed too easy. He really didn't have alot of distractions or detours to make it seem real. In quest tales, usually the goal is something the lead character must have. In this book, it wasn't something he really needed, but something he just wanted. And after his spritual lessons, he kept after it, even thought it was gold and something he should have realized he didn't really need. In most fables, a treasure would have remained as a symbol of something else. Again this goes back to me not being happy with him finding a real treasure of gold. <br />In some ways this reminded me of another quest tale full of spiritual truths, \\"The Destiny of Miro\\". But at the end of it, I didn't feel let down.
B000002UJQ|5.0|This is a must own for any music fan's collection. This album is a completely original masterpiece. As far as Radiohead goes, I actually like Kid A better because it is definitely unlike ANYTHING I've ever heard.
B00069YDXU|5.0|This is an excellent dvd. This showcases ELP' great personal talents, and shows how they won over a sceptical canadian crowd who was attending a jazz festival, and did'nt know what to expect. By the end of the show, they were standing and cheering for more, even though I got the impression that half the crowd probably knew \\"lucky man\\" only, when ELP took the stage.
B00082IJ08|5.0|Like you, I loved the first Gorillaz record. But also like you, I was a little worried about Gorillaz falling prey to the dreaded sophomore slump that many bands subsequently release after belting out such a stunning debut. Unfortunately, a lot of people are calling \\"Demon Days\\" just that, which couldn't be further from the truth. I can't say that I'm surprised, due to the change in the band's line up. Most notably, Dan The Automator has left the group (as well as Del), leaving Damon Albarn as the leader and creative visionary of the group (along with producer, Danger Mouse). That alone is enough to lose a few fans. But the fact is, Damon Albarn hasn't crafted anything this beautiful since Blur's 1994 \\"Parklife\\", which is truly an amazing feat. Especially considering Blur's last album \\"Think Tank\\" wasn't quite up to par. But this is very different than a Blur record. There is a real sense of liberation on Albarn's side. Gorillaz has really given him a chance to spread his wings, and let him experiment and try things he wasn't able to do with Blur. Albarn's flame has been re-ignited with this record, proving once again that his musical vision is one of a genius.<br /><br />The record has a very cinematic feel to it. It possesses a lot of build-up and tear-down elements to it. The first few tracks feels like a warm up to the beautiful and chilling, \\"Dirty Harry\\", then bursting in with the climax of \\"Feel Good Inc.\\" the first radio single off the record. Those two really hit hard, and the album doesn't let up until the album's lead out. \\"El Ma&ntilde;ana\\" and \\"Every Planet We Reach Is Dead\\" are equally funky and remarkable tunes. The collaborators are sprinkled throughout the album, which are never overbearing, like on the track \\"November Has Come,\\" where rap veteran Daniel Dumile (aka \\"MF Doom\\") lends a hand. It all leads up to the biggest climax of the album, \\"Dare\\". A gorgeously crafted pop song that has \\"club hit\\" written all over it (it's one of my favorites). The album starts to calm down over the final three tracks with great tracks like \\"Fire Coming Out of the Monkey's Head\\".

B0002X314C|4.0|John Legend brings the soulful voice with a twist to the airwaves.  Many consider him the equal to Ms. Alicia Keys they are both known to lace their music with strings from the piano and then to belt out a beautiful lyric behind it.  With Kayne West and Alicia Keys back him he can't fail touring with Alicia probably help with establishing who he was but when Kayne took him on and the album dropped all I can say was it was a rap.  The music has an R&B cadence with a little Hip Hop to it while John can still be found laying the piano keys down when you hear him vocally he does well also.<br /><br />The first single off of the album was Ordinary People I instantly feel in love with this song I enjoyed listening to him play the piano and telling the story of love but when Number One hit the airwaves I just knew that I would always enjoyed John Legends music.
0156421178|5.0|Like many students, I've of course read the seemingly standard 1984 and Animal Farm (the former I found much more intriguing) and for a while was virtually unaware of much of the remaining Orwell catalogue.  However, I've just finished \\"Homage..,\\" and had previously read \\"Down and Out,\\" and, while I still cannot so easily say that either wholly trump 1984, I can affirm that they do however offer much insight into the world of Orwell that is largely responsible for 1984 to have even been conceived, especially \\"Homage...\\"  To some effect, it is a matter of preference as far as being able to tolerate the somewhat lesser degree of 'flow' that is inherent in Orwell's non-fiction which may shy some people away from delving into his lesser known works.  Nonetheless; highly introspective, very personal, and often very reader-conscious, Orwell's \\"Homage...\\" really digs deep into the heart of his experience in fighting the Spanish War and, if the reader is somewhat politically-inclined, Orwell offers several chapters devoted to exploring the politics and issues surrounding the war.  I deeply enjoyed the book and I feel most fans of 1984 who are curious in the field of politics would appreciate this piece as a primer into the world of Orwell's non-fiction.

B00097DX3U|4.0|The reviews on this CD are going one or two ways.  People either love it or hate it.  I've listened to it a few times now and  while it is different from the first Audioslave CD I think it's actually better. The songs on here aren't as heavy but I think they are better.  It takes balls for them to do more uplifting songs like \\"Doesn't Remind Me\\" and \\"Dandelion\\" (which are two of my favorites on here).  It's good to see they don't feel like they have to do the same type songs Rage and Soundgarden did. Just remember this is Audioslave not RageGarden. Completely differnt band. If you feel they shouldn't change you can always go back and listen to \\"Evil Empire\\" and \\"Superunknown\\".
B00062ZE44|5.0|This album is a piece of art that comes to define the term, \\"musical talent\\". The singer's voice is incredible and the band is just outstanding! Hearing it from the first time reveals the huge effort spent to setup and mix the vocals, instruments, orchestra, and chorus. The commercial songs \\"Memories\\" and \\"Stand My Ground\\" are extraordinary, while the songs \\"Jillian\\", \\"Forsaken\\", and \\"It's The Fear\\" are just composed to make a deep notch on the surface of modern music. If you want to learn about classy-modern music, you should hear this album. The keyboardist (Martin Spierenburg), the singer (Sharon Den Adel), and the guitarist (Robert Westerholt) have done an excellent effort in composing the music, especially the keyboardist. I've never thought Gothic Rock would sound that cool!
0553208845|5.0|Even those who are not into Buddhism will find Siddharta to be a powerful book.  It speaks more of the quest for a boy's initiation into manhood than it does of a wandering monk's search for perfection. Like the works of Roman Payne or the Brothers Grimm, it speaks in a timeless and eery tone revealing Hesse to be more of a poet than a sage.
B00003CXCT|1.0|G Lucas should release the originals without the horrible add ons and edits so that we can see these movies the way they were released originally. Especially bad - 1) the edited Greedo scene 2) the added Jaba scene in the original 3) all those stupid CGI monsters especially roaming around the cantina that did not need to be added 4)changing the song in Return of the Jedi 5) adding more monsters in the Return of the Jedi Jaba scene looking like some cheap 3D movie. Terrible!

B000002BYD|5.0|Yield was my first Pearl Jam CD. I was relatively new to rock music, so I was still in my transitioning phase. Needless to say, I didn't even get past Given To Fly before I came to the conclusion that this CD was horrible. It took over two years before I'd ever listen to it again. But when I did, I was hooked. I played it everyday for about two weeks before rushing out to buy everything I could find by them. This is, without a doubt, still one of my favorite CDs.<br /><br />This CD starts off with the fast paced Brain Of J. I love all of Pearl Jam's opening songs, but this is at the top of the list. It's extremely short but oh so addictive. No Way sounds like it was lifted straight off a Soundgarden disc. Even Ed's voice sounds like Chris Cornell's. With that comparison how can this song not be good? I heard Peal Jam compare Given To Fly to a tidal wave, which is by far the best description I've heard. One of PJ's best songs. If Given To Fly isn't the best song on here, then Do The Evolution surely is. I believe you need to see/hear it live to really appreciate it though. The energy put into this song is very easily heard. MFC is another favorite of mine. The verses seem to hold this song together. This took a couple listens to grasp, but when I did I couldn't understand why I didn't like it before. All Those Yesterdays is a nice ending to this CD. Along with every other ending song by them, it's rather slow yet still has plenty of intensity.<br /><br />A few of my favorite songs on here are Brain Of J, Given To Fly, No Way, Do The Evolution, and MFC. Every song on here compliments the next beautifully, as it tends to be with each PJ CD. This is worth whatever amount of money you'll pay and more. A keeper under any circumstance.
B00003CXRP|5.0|...I believe they would feel less comfortable in doing so had the lead not been so masterfully played by Hanks. He is such a skillful actor as to invite critique on the miniscule at the expense of seeing the overall appeal of the film.<br /><br /> In any other contempary actors hands this film would have been distinctly lack lustre. It is solitary and as such requires great emtional content which is visceral and believable, it also in need of great humanity and Hanks has the ability to deliver on all scores. You feel his isolation, frustration and fear in a way that is palpable and intense. His sense of alienation and irony is delivered with perfect pitch in the last section of the film and the film leaves one with a mixed sense of fear and hope, undoubtedly the main characters displaced internal dilemma.<br /><br /> It may not be heavy on plot and action but this film is more about the extremes of the human condition and survival instinct and it also stands as an intense study of Hanks craft at it's best.

B0007Y4TVU|4.0|I was so happy that SOAD was coming out with another album. The first time I listened to it I was more like meh. It took me another time of listening to it to really enjoy it. This wasn't their best, but was still good. I enjoyed the songs, but some of them were just to bleh.  <br /> <br />Sometimes i'll skip through 1 or 2 cause I dont like them, but it is still a great cd. I suggest you buy it if your a true SOAD fan! Cant wait for their other cd coming out, and hopefully it wont let-down as much as this did.
B00000I5Y6|5.0|Now this is music. Before the hundreds of shallow pop bands that mostly dominate the music industry today, there was Kansas. Kansas created music with beautiful melodies, unique blends of various instruments, and lyrics with real meaning. The band was made up of true musicians, not a bunch of talentless individuals trying to blend in with the rest of the music industry. They created a musical experience unlike no other, and this album demonstrates some of their greatest musical creations. <br /> <br />Carry On Wayward Son - Wonderful vocals, great piano, and several smoothly performed tempo changes. <br />Point Of Know Return - Another great song, this one has very active violin during the chorus. <br />Fight Fire With Fire - Unfortunately, I would say that this song doesn't quite fit in with the rest of the album. It has more of a 80's feel to it, with more electric guitar than the other songs, not to mention a different lead singer. <br />Dust In The Wind - A slower song, but very, very good. A perfect blend of acoustic guitar and violin. <br />Song For America - Beautiful 3 minute intro in this one, it builds up to the lyrical climax. Very interesting use of synth in this song. <br />Hold On - The violin adds a heavy emotional atmosphere to this song, and the vocals uphold that atmosphere. Good song with good lyrics. <br />No One Together - Very talented piano, mixed with just the right amount of violin and synth. <br />Play The Game Tonight - Another song on the cd with John Elefante as lead singer, but this one blends better with the rest of the cd than Fight Fire With Fire. <br />The Wall - Good electric guitar intro, powerful but not too powerful. Good use of synth in this song. <br />The Pinnacle - This song is an epic song with everything: electric guitar, piano, synth, and violin. Great vocals, espeically near the end. <br />The Devil Game - Rousing song with good violin and synth. Great lyrics and vocals. <br />Closet Chronicles - This song is performed live. Good music and poem style lyrics. A good closer for the album. <br /> <br />All in all, this cd is a beautiful example of real music Kansas-style. <br /> <br />- Pale Mercury -

B0007Y4TVU|4.0|So I've been a SOAD-imite since \\"Toxicity\\" was released. From that point, I bought their self-titled album (Sugar, Suite-Pea, Spiders, etc). And, yes, I got \\"Steal This Album\\" as well. I preferred the self-titled one, but all had 3-5 above-average tracks on them. Needless to say, I was excited to buy their new one. <br /> <br />Yes, Daron sings too often. Yes Serj's absence is felt. Yes, it's too short. Yes, it's still pretty damn good. <br /> <br />1. \\"Soldier Side - Intro\\" Just a few-seconds long intro, which a song does not make. Seems to exist solely to open up... <br /> <br />2. \\"B.Y.O.B.\\" This is the epitome of radio-ready System. Screaming, catchy hooks, gutteral screaming, shrieking, the whole thing. Luckilly, also, Daron is just a background screamer here, retaining the classic SOAD feel. <br /> <br />3. \\"Revenga\\" By far my favorite song on here. Starting out with Serj's staccato quick-as-a-bullet delivery and leading into a wholly satisfying, musically pleasant refrain. It's also nice that the boys sing about normal things every now and then. Nary a reference to the Armenian Genocide, simply a song about a woman who dun dun a man wrong. Epic guitar work as well. <br /> <br />4. \\"Cigaro\\" Seems like it's to be the next radio release, but I hope not. Just a re-hash of many of their past songs with no specific feel or personality. A song I skip more often than not. <br /> <br />5. \\"Radio/Video\\" My second-favorite track on the CD. That simple gypsy-meets-circus feel that was last on display in full with \\"Peephole\\" from their self-titled debut. Also a couple of classic Serj screams. <br /> <br />6. \\"This Cocaine Makes Me Feel Like I'm on This Song\\" Yawn. If it didn't have the phrase \\"gonorrhea gorgonzola\\" it'd be totally useless. But oddly, I now want pizza. At least I won't be tempted to eat the fish. <br /> <br />7. \\"Violent Pornography\\" A solid SOAD song. Chants, rhythmic stacatto, repetition, cussing. Nice! One of those \\"social commentary\\" songs that actually sounds good and doesn't come off as too heavy-handed. Probably the song that best blends the vocal stylings of Serj and Daron. <br /> <br />8. \\"Question!\\" Somewhat like \\"Forest\\" meets \\"Science\\" via \\"Aerials\\". Really, though, songs like these with their meditations on some of life's deeper questions with beautiful, even haunting musical arrangements and Serj's voice are what set System apart. <br /> <br />9. \\"Sad Statue\\" The-anti B.Y.O.B in that it takes a look at certain timely political ills and hot-button topics wistfully and futilely, as opposed to with violent anger. The refrain of, \\"You and me, we'll all go down in history with a sad Statue of Liberty and a generation that didn't agree\\" it poetic without being trite. <br /> <br />10. \\"Old School Hollywood\\" Interesting. Synthesizers. Is this Roger and Zap? The guitar, though, and somewhat non-sensical lyrics let us know who this really is. So you can tell Daron is having fun singing this, which does count for something, but, overall, just not that strong of a song. <br /> <br />11. \\"Lost in Hollywood\\" A pretty, sad song that would have benefitted from Serj's voice. The tempo is cool, lyrics solid, Daron's singing is ok. It's just that, as with more than a handful of tracks on the CD, seemed like greatness was close, then they stopped short of getting there. Serj, grab the mic and rock out on the radio, video, and CD. Hurry, Hypnotize me. <br /> <br />(Overall, though, still an exciting, solid release with 4-6 songs I could loop for quite a while before tiring of them. Hey, perfection would've been boring.) <br />
B00005JNBQ|1.0|Okay, I'm going to admit right up front: I only watched the first half-hour of this movie.  My stomach wouldn't take anymore.  During the 30 minutes I watched, this movie never evoked as much as a slight smile, much less a laugh.  Maybe it's the fact that I'm over 40 and actually enjoy plot in a movie.  Perhaps this is something for the reality show crowd.  Perhaps this movie actually had something later with some merit, but I'll never know.  I don't buy or rent a movie to enjoy only the last 15 or 20 minutes.  I expect the whole movie to be at least somewhat entertaining.  This one falls well short of that goal.
0399128964|5.0|Fascinating ideas, cool characters, and a page-turner to boot.  Re-reading it is almost as sweet as the first time because the main character's ability to see the future and his reactions to it are more poignant and delicious when you share his unique knowledge.
B0002858YS|4.0|I found the Killers yesterday, before which I had only heard \\"Mr. Brightside\\" and \\"Somebody Told Me\\" on the radio. They were ok, but not my favorite songs. Yesterday I got my hands on one of their CDs and have been listening to it pretty much nonstop since then. I have changed my mind. Their music is AMAZING. For those people who have reviewed after only listening to the two songs of theirs played on the radio, you are missing out--you can't judge this band by two of their most-pop-like songs; you need to listen to all of it before judging it. My personal favorites are \\"Andy, You're a Star\\" and \\"Jenny Was a Friend of Mine.\\" <br /> <br />If you haven't heard the Killers, I strongly, strongly recommend that you get your hands on the CD--and fast.
B0006FFRW0|5.0|This is a replacement for my original review from a few months ago, since deleting the old one was the only way to change it to 5 stars. So we have me originally assuming the recording was done on analog (because Flood and Alan Moulder worked on it) and being annoyed that they only transferred it at 48khz, another guy claiming I'm wrong and it was recorded in 24/48 in the first place, someone else saying it was recorded to analog first and then to probably 16/48, and the last guy rebuffing that it was all done to hard drives and that's all. Well, I seem to remember reading an interview with Flood somewhere that said he and Trent had recorded some of the guitars, beats (machine and human), and a few other things to tape (not sure what size) and then sent it into the computer. They like the effect of running the tape at different speeds or reversing it, then playing it at a corrected speed. But I seem to remember this being more limited compared to Pretty Hate Machine, where even the vocals being sent through guitar pedals eventually ended up on tape. I'm also a bit hurt at the comments about Garbage's first album. I like the way it sounds. EVERYTHING at Smart Studios for that project eventually ended up on tape for that recording, but it was highly experimental. They did anything they liked the sound of. If a cheap keyboard's digital sampler did something interesting to an instrument, they'd send it in there, screw around with it, then pump it back out to tape. In this way I think the mid '90's was a revolutionary era for modern music. Anything went, and if they liked the result it happened...and with all the complexity involved there was a great element of randomness to it all that allowed for unexpected results, like one of the engineers accidentally getting electrical line noise from an air conditioning unit and the guys deciding to keep it. In this era of Pro Tools I think perhaps we're losing some of that synchronicity and randomness that made the era great. Sure, people can still go into a meat locker and hit a side of beef to get the percussion sound they want, but will they get the strange stuff they would have in the '90's with all the random gear and analog to digital to analog to whatever confusion going on? I don't think so. Now everything's so pristine and Dust Brothers-esque digitally engineered...like a Star Wars prequel compared to Code 46 or Superman. Maybe being able to create exactly what you imagined with complete control is less likely to produce greatness. So much of great artistry is seeing the mess and random quirks and being able to pick out the new compounds that have sprung up. Anyway, I'm venting a little.<br /><br />I find it very odd how a number of reviewers don't realize the difference between the SACD Hybrid release and the Dual Disc release. They aren't the same. And yes, both will play on CD players, though the Dual Disc might not play on certain slot loading mechanisms, like those in car stereos. A lot of universal player manufacturers don't want people using them out of fear the equipment will be damaged, but I haven't heard anything significant about actual problems aside from discs that aren't recognized. While I no longer have the Dual Disc copy, the Deluxe Edition sounds excellent. It probably didn't matter, but at least the bonus disc is a keeper. As far as the debate between SACD and DVD-Audio, I have certainly noticed that on material recorded to Pro Tools strait from the mic preamps even a lot of CD masters sound more transparent and right than SACD's, but I could swear there's more body and dimensional presence to DSD in spite of this. I guess it just depends on the release...maybe the randomness isn't gone after all.<br /><br />Trent ripped off A Warm Place from Bowie? Well, he didn't sue him, did he? There's one guy saying the songs just sound alike using a simple structure inherited from the Greeks (like much of western music), and someone else claims Reznor just used a melody from the song, which at the time was hard to find and showing up mostly in sushi commercials, or something. Who cares? Reznor didn't just record the Bowie song strait onto his hard drive and stick his and Flood's names on it. It's primarily sampling based music, which Bowie himself is involved with. They all rip off other people and are themselves ripped off. If there was an issue, those two worked it out obviously since they toured together, performed together, and stared in a music video together. I think they realize they're in this together making art...advancing it in a way. On one end of the extreme there's Milli Vanilli, and on the other there's the sort of paranoia that results in Chrissie Hynde signing over her \\"very ass\\" to Shirley Manson to stick it to the lawyers and let her borrow anything of hers she wants. I'm just happy to enjoy the results.om the song, which at the time was hard to find and showing up mostly in sushi commercials, or something. Who cares?

B0000025H0|5.0|MARATHON is a wonderful album by Santana, who is not only a soulful, masterful guitarist, but a wonderful human being who supports sanctions against Indonesia for their trumped-up 2005 drug-smuggling conviction of a foreign tourist. That said, all of the songs here are wonderful, contrary to what virtually all critics have said. These reviewers are missing out on some great vocals from Alex Ligertwood and Greg Walker, as well as hot, fluid guitar work from the man himself. MARATHON is an album that anyone who loves rock & roll AND cares about others should own.

B0000041BX|4.0|The great composer Franz Schubert is often talked about as a \\"late bloomer,\\" referring to how his last compositions emerged with great maturity, emotional complexity and consumate skill.  These last four quartets are part of this final, masterful phase of Schubert's short life as a composer and should be in every chamber-music collector's shelf.<br /><br />Among the finest performances of these great quartets stands the recordings here from the legendary Quartetto Italiano - one of the top quartets in the 60's and 70's. The Quartetto Italiano really have a nack for penetrating the depths of such emotive works as #14 or #15 and bring out the intended drama and pathos within.<br /><br />Their powerful reading of the great, last quartet in G (#15) is especially noted by many major reviewers as one of the finest recordings of this complex masterpiece.  The first movement in particular is epic in scale (lasting some 25 minutes) and exudes a powerful, anguished emotional mood which the Italianos bring out with tremedous depth and passion that can send chills down your spine.  In all, their playing is of the highest caliber and just sounds superb in terms of synchonicity, intonation and phrasing.  Their unison within cresendos is impeccable as was their ability to create sonorities on a \\"symphonic scale.\\"<br /><br />However, I found one quirky sonic flaw throughout the entire \\"Death and the Maiden\\" and other quartets when listening with headphones: there was an intermittent and jarring  \\"booming\\" sound that is quite distracting.  It is probably not be an issue without headphones, but be forewarned nevertheless.  Overall, the sound quality is very good but not perfect given the transfer to CD from the 1960's analog tapes. There is not quite the depth and realism of more modern recordings in general, but this should not discourage purchase for most.<br /><br />Other quartets to consider for these works are the Guarnari Quartet and, in some works, the Emersons - although the Emerson's style is more \\"direct\\" and less \\"old world graceful\\" like the Alban Berg's.  The Quatuor Mosaiques also recorded a powerful reading of the Rosamunde quartet and others that ranks with the best along with an award-winning recording from the Tacaks Quartet.<br /><br />All-in-all, I would say the Italianos is one of the finer SETS of Schubert's greatest (last) quartets - although some individual quartets may be better represented by other ensembles.  When I hear music of this stature, it reminds me how unfortunate it was for Schubert that his enormous talent and output was not much recognized nor greatly valued in his day outside his close circles. And these last quartets are only a small part of that heritage.irect\\" and less \\"old world graceful\\" like the Alban Berg's.

B00097DX3U|3.0|Given the amazing number of crappy albums out there its hard to come upon a good rock CD. Audioslave has proven to be a band that can light the way to good rock. <br />They do it good... but they could do better. <br /> <br />Cornell is awesome... (but age and the constant larynx problems are taking its toll). The RATM section sound good, Morello makes me laugh... he brings nice riffs to my ears.... but they could do better. <br /> <br />They could try differently structured songs, like Soungarden did, not the same verse - chorus x 2, bridge, solo and chorus. <br /> <br />Unfortunately, for a reason that might be agreed between them (or label) Cornell doesn't throw some rythm guitar in, either acoustic or electric (as needed)... he is a very talented guitar player. <br /> <br />The album does sound more Soundgarden than RATM.... but they could do better. I was expecing nice harmony and backing vocals, more melodic solos and stronger songs. <br />Overall a solid album much better than most bands nowadays. <br /> <br />Highlights: <br />Heaven is dead <br />Your time has come <br />Drown me slowly

Lipton [...]however ludicrously present this notion as their own, as if enlightening the public about something they didn't know.

Claiming these institutions engage in big science and politics and compete for the proverbial lion's share of funding does nothing to detract from the legitimacy of their goals and work.  \\"Big science\\" takes \\"big money.\\"  And it takes a big amount of time and commitment in research, which is often painstakingly slow, taxing work.

Who doubts that having a go-get-it, positive expectation for life does the body and soul good?  We don't need a book to tell us this.  [...]    And why dangerously stupid?  Because reality is not concerned with what the mind merely beliefs.  Again, health has many factors.  A healthy mental attitude is important, yes, but so is nutrition, diet, and lifestyle.  And yes, so is medicine.  There are times when even a life-time of good diet and exercise cannot prevent a health problem.  What are we to make of this?  That a person had the wrong beliefs?  That the person was, to use [...] Lipton's own characterizing statements, \\"victims\\" of psychological programming and thinking.  Nonsense.      There is no opprobrium of any sort of \\"victimhood\\" in such a case.  It is the unfortunate happenstances of life that sometimes occur. [...]    I am passionate about my stance in all this because I know of people who've been deathly ill and were afraid of modern medicine.  Science was something too removed from their common experience to appear as anything other than confusing and even outright frightening.[..]It would be funny if only it weren't for the fact that there are people, who out of fear and desperation will cling to the prospect that mere belief, faith, prayer, and wishing will heal them instead of seeing a doctor.  Some, wait to let medicine intervene until the fear of their decline then becomes greater.  And sometimes it becomes too late.    To those people, I would say, yes, keep thinking positive, but if ill or in need of medical help, see a doctor.  To those that think that God has been dismissed by the arrogance of science, I leave you with this.  If God has made man with this marvelous gift of intelligence and faculty of reasoning, in which man can fathom the mysteries of lifeand shed light on them and in that process elevate himself to a higher, commanding position, then the real arrogance is to ignore that precious gift and not take full advantage of it.

2266144340|3.0|With all the talk about the Da Vinci Code, I decided to pick it up and have a read.  I personally prefer Brown's Angels and Demons to this book.  Dan Brown is a convincing writer, and I am surprised at how many people take the Da Vinci Code as truths and rejects the Bible.  There are enough books and coumentaries to counter the claims of the Da Vinci Code, and the concept that Brown brought up that Jesus had a wife in Mary Magdalene and they had children are not new.  It was brought forth in another fictional book marketed as historical \\"The Holy Blood and the Holy Grail\\" by Michael Baigent, Richard Leigh, Henry Lincoln.<br /><br />The acclaim that this book is getting is like the movie \\"The Last Temptation of Christ\\" years ago.  Know that when you read the Da Vinci Code, it is fictional, and it was not marketed as fiction for nothing!  It is a fun read, none the less, and what keeps the book moving is not only the plot, but that the whole book is written almost as a minute to minute account of what was happening, displaying in full view for the reader the action and suspense that it brings.
B0007Y4TVU|5.0|System of a Down continues to amaze and shock as America's definitive alt-metal band. From album to album, they stun their audience, and Mesmerize may be the best example of this yet. The awkwardness, the beauty, the compelling musical flair. There is nothing normal about Mesmerize, and certainly nothing mainstream, but certainly brilliant as well. This may very well be System's best, unseating the classic Toxicity from that top spot. I had high hopes for Mesmerize, but this miracle album exceeded my expectations. The style varies throughout. B.Y.O.B. gives System's personal takes on the Iraq war, and it is quite a different approach than normal. A thudding bass line and an entertaining chorus drives the song, making it the best song on the album. In fact, there is only one track I cannot recommend, track 6, the cocaine one. It is so brutally metal mainstream and so predictable that it hurts. Screaming mixed with pure thrash is not cool for System at all. But every other song is incredible. Even Violent Pornography, with its ridiculous title, is one of the best songs on the record. Cigaro is certainly noteworthy, combining beautiful music with awkward lyrics. Songs such as Radio/Video and Revenga are also standout tracks. Their varying musical influences make them a pure joy to behold. System fans, purchase this album. Its pure beauty and uncompromising style is classic, leading it to be the best album to come out this year! There is nothing Down about this System. There is only a rise of a great musical force.
B0008G2IRO|5.0|I listened to it once and liked it.  I listened again and it just got better.  I love the overall feel the new album has (a playful yet ominous sound), but I especially like the last three tracks, which form sort of a mini-play.  The closing title track will burn itself into your mind and (possibly) break your heart.<br /><br />It's a must-have.
B000002H97|1.0|Wow...talk about the \\"Black Album\\" - more like the \\"We sold out Album\\". They found some great acclaim with the song \\"One\\" on the AJFA album, continuing with their great thrash tradition. So what do they do? They totally CHEESE out with this album. I agree with the one guy above; this album sucks ass. If your just trying Metallica, I suggest \\"And Justice for All\\" and any previous album. \\"Garage Inc.\\" is exceptional - the covers rock! I personally like the albums after the \\"Black Album\\", with the exception of \\"St. Anger\\" - If there was a way to get worse, they accomplished it with this one.

B0001XAPY2|5.0|Even in his lesser efforts, Miyazaki's film surpass just about everything else that is taking place in feature length animation.  Although I have managed to see most of his films over the years, PORCO RUSSO (Red Pig) is one that I have just seen for the first time, thanks to the series of high quality rereleases that Disney is undertaking.  Apart from the long autoplay Disney commercial that intrudes upon the viewer when you first put the disc in, I must admit that Disney continues to do an excellent job in these releases, providing both the original Japanese version as well as consistently excellent English dubbings.  By any standard, Miyazaki has established his reputation as the premiere feature length animator in film  PORCO RUSSO is not a masterpiece along the lines of SPIRITED AWAY or NAUSICAA OF THE VALLEY OF THE WIND, but it supplies further proof of Miyazaki's versatility and breadth.  The setting is untypical, focusing on air pirates in the Adriatic, with excursions into Italy, though the focus on airplanes is profoundly typical of his work.  Porco Russo is a highly accomplished bounty hunter, famous for his red airplane and for having mysteriously been transformed into a pig.  His aeronautic preeminence, however, has been challenged by the sudden appearance of a cocky American flier, who has been hired to protect the air pirates and who seemingly disposes of Porco Russo when he shoots down his plane when the engine is stalled.<br /><br />To be honest, the plot is adequate, but the real joy of the film lies in watching the interaction of the characters onscreen, and at marveling at the superb animation.  All the details are simply perfect, from the studied stylishness of Porco Russo's outfits, which seem to have been copied directly from the pages of J. Peterman catalogs, to the specifics of the airplane design.  There is also the elegance in the way Miyazaki's characters move and the way he frames each scene using the rhythm and pacing one associates with live action films rather than animation.  Whereas the typical Disney film for decades contained all the action in the foreground, Miyazaki frequently allows the foreground to dominate the screen visually, while the action takes place in the deep background.<br /><br />I suppose very few will experience this as their first venture into the magic that I Miyazaki.  If so, as wonderful as this film is, the best is yet to come.  Based merely on films such as NAUSICAA OF THE VALLEY OF THE WIND, MY NEIGHBOR TOTORO, SPIRITED AWAY, and THE PRINCESS MONONOKE Miyazaki would have to go down as the finest animator of all time, since while others employ entire teams to produce the film, Miyazaki writes, directs, and serves as primary animator.  But when one adds in such films as PORCO RUSSO, which would represent the highpoint in the career of most other animators, his brilliance is made even more obvious.ith live action films rather than animation.

0385513755|2.0|How long has this book been out? How long have I managed to avoid reading it?  So then what happens? A quiet evening at a friend's house and nothing to read, I cave in, I crumble. I must read. I am a reader. I read cereal boxes. I read receipts. So I read \\"The da Vinci Code.\\"  To make it a complete treat, it's the Special Illustrated Edition.  Oh joy.  This man does not need a review from me. He's made his millions no matter what I think. But here I am anyway, soon to be pushed out of sight by all the other reviews coming along after me. Ok. Calm down. First, take all the deepy darky \\"mystery\\" away (Grails, bloodlines, secret societies, Leonardo's paintings) and what we have here is a mediocre thriller that could have been written by any number of jobbing hacks and sold in hundreds of airport lounges all over the world. Flat, dull, short chapters for ever shorter attention spans...where is Agatha Christie when you need her? Dame Agatha could have taken this whole thing and made the puzzle of a lifetime out of it. I'm not even going to bother with the code and the Templars and the French who call Jesus greatgreatgreatgreatgreatgreat-grandpap and as for Leonardo, I leave the poor man in peace. Besides, whole tomes have been written in rebuttal. Are still being written in rebuttal from all angles. Nope. What I get out of all this is the terrible need we each of us have to touch something meaningful again...something our churches have long denied us, or have lost themselves over the long years of playing politics with people's hearts--not to mention, souls. We are so needy we make a sort of icon out of a bit of hack work, talk about it endlessly. But what the hey. Brown's doggerel is sending a lot of people on journeys they might never have taken. They're looking for God again. They're looking for the Goddess. One place to find Her is in a book I cannot praise highly enough: Ki Longfellow's \\"The Secret Magdalene.\\" If Brown's efforts lead to books like this book, I forgive his every hackneyed word.ve his every hackneyed word.
B0007Y4TVU|3.0|Ok, so when I bought this CD, I didn't like it very much, and while I have to say that it has somewhat grown on me, I still don't find it to be anything amazing. For having waited all this time the CD is still definately a let down for System of a Down fans. For one, and I know I'm not the first person to say this, Daron sings way too much. Serj's voice is what makes System of a Down System of a Down, and without it, or without as much of it at least, it has a totally different vibe that I'm not sure I like too much. Songs like \\"This Cocaine Makes Me Feel Like I'm on This Song\\" and \\"Sad Statue\\" are still very very good, but it's because they don't have Daron singing. For example, Daron pretty much ruins what could have been potentially good songs in \\"Cigaro,\\" \\"Violent Pornography,\\" and \\"BYOB\\" (BYOB I don't mind too much because he's just screaming, not that whiny high pitched junk). Overall the CD probably doesn't even deserve 3 stars, but 2 didn't seem to be fair to them, because the album does have it's moments. I'm still going to get \\"Hypnotize\\" when it comes out and hopefully it won't have so much of Daron's annoying voice in it.
B00005JNTX|5.0|Despite the posted opinions of several reviewers that \\"you'd have to be a(n) [insert derogatory remark here] to enjoy Sin City,\\" it still has an overwhelmingly high rating here.  I guess that means the \\"Ayes\\" have it in this case...and I'm among them.  I guess those reviewers think that 90% of the people who've rated the film here are stupid, depraved, sexist, or all of the above.    Let's take a look at the detractors for a moment, shall we?    First, there are those who are appalled at the level of violence, despite a great deal of it taking place off-screen (in the comics, it should be pointed out, they would not have had this luxury).  But these are the same people who complain about violent films across the board (though they generally ignore the violence in certain movies because they LIKE them, regardless).  There have been FAR more violent films than Sin City (including The Passion of the Christ, a movie generally hailed by those who hate Sin City)...but these folks like to talk about this movie as if it's the ne plus ultra of gore.  This is ludicrous, and these people aren't worth discussing, really...so we'll move on.    \\"This movie was so sexist, I can't believe it!  This is NOT a female-friendly film!!!\\"  Interesting.  My girlfriend, who is simultaneously a strong, independent woman and an unashamed \\"girly girl,\\" really loved this movie.  Then I gave her the comics to read, and she loved them as well...so we went to see the movie again.  Of course, she doesn't look at things from such a narrow point of view.  She recognizes that EVERY character in Sin City is an archetype...the men are portrayed just as badly as the women, if not worse.  Despite all of the talk about women being degraded and brutalized in Sin City, most of the bruality is aimed at the male characters, and the most empowered characters in the film are women.  Go figure.    \\"This isn't really film noir...what a rip-off.\\"  I've heard every conceivable argument here, and don't agree one bit.\\"Film noir has lead characters with fatal flaws...Sin City doesn't.\\"  Were we watching the SAME Sin City?  The Sin City in which EVERY lead character has at least ONE fatal flaw?  To say that Hartigan, Dwight, and (come on, people) Marv have no fatal flaws is like saying that James Dean had no style.  Next.  \\"Film noir has characters double-crossing each other...Sin City doesn't.\\"  You mean like Bob shooting his partner in the back?  Like Becky selling out her friends for mob money?  These don't constitute double-crosses?  Again, were we watching the same movie?  Next.  \\"Film noir has plot twists...Sin City doesn't.\\"  Oh, come on!  Let's not be stupid here, people.  Sin City has everything that film noir requires...flawed characters, double-crosses, bleak worldview, complex character relationships, high-level corruption...you name it.  Sin City is film noir, and the people who point out what film noir is supposed to be are simply proving my point.    \\"This movie is SOOOOOOO derivative of Tarantino's movies (or any other popular director)!!!!!!!\\"   Is it?  Despite the fact that the original Sin City comics were released in 1991, when QT was still relatively unknown?  I've heard people say that Sin City is a Pulp Fiction rip-off, despite the fact that much of the material in Sin City was written and drawn before Pulp Fiction, and the film is essentially a carbon copy of Miller's comics.  That's strange...perhaps Mr. Miller has a time machine?    Among those who are fans of the comics, there have been very few complaints...the only one I've heard was from a chap who complained that the film was TOO MUCH like the comics (which I didn't understand in the first place), but then went on to point out things that were left out of the movie, and how that bothered him.  Seems he was so confused that he couldn't decide whether he hated the movie for being too faithful to the comics, or not faithful enough.  But apart from him, it seems that every fan of Miller's comics is hailing Sin City as the ultimate comic book adaptation...and with good reason.  It is a PERFECT translation from page to screen, unlike anything I have ever seen.  Finally, comic book fans have a film that doesn't pointlessly alter the storyline, doesn't change the style, doesn't ruin the dialogue of the books, doesn't kill the mood of the source material.    In my opinion, Sin City is the perfect comic book movie, painstakingly adapted from one of the most powerful comic book series in the history of the medium.  And it seems that the majority agree with me.  That doesn't necessarily mean that we're right...maybe we ARE all stupid, depraved, sexist buffoons, however unlikely that may be...but hopefully, I've done a sufficient job of explaining why I think this is a great movie, why I will always have a place in my heart for it, and why I'm eagerly awaiting the next Sin City film.        This review was written by a well-studied film buff...who is in no way a sexist, an idiot, or a psychopath.
B00005JN2Z|3.0|i went into collateral being cognizant of a couple of highly pertinent things:    1. this is a michael mann movie, which implies boring aerial shots from a helicopter that was rented out using the majority of the budget  2. there will be unbearably awful music to drown out the nauseating dialogue  3. there will be an easily predictable showdown at the end that will be taut yet tender enough as to be ready for public consumption - deviating from formulaic action rules and endings would be asking far too much of what little intelligence he gives his audience  4. people will inexplicably shower it with the kind of hosannas and praise usually reserved for bearded messianic figures    aside from that and the buzz surrounding the performances in the film, i was relatively unaware with what the movie concerned.  i was told by various sources (none of whom i should trust in matters of cinema) that it was imperious that i see the film.  i acquiesced and borrowed the film (i'd be damned if i'd give a penny to the (...)that made \\"ali\\") from my girlfriend's brother.      i permitted an ounce of optimism to slip under my usually impenetrable derma of cold, practiced cynicism and actually began to enjoy the film.  aside from mann's patented abrasive camera work everything seemed to be headed in a positive direction.  however, i must have forgotten the rule that anything containing jada pinkett smith will be incontrovertibly bad, because i foresaw good things in the flick's future.  sure it was nothing beyond a solid action film, but it was one that didn't insult my intelligence - which is a rarity.  then of course it had to come up with the most boiled down ending imaginable.      what went wrong?    the performances are not the culpable party.  certainly foxx's overplayed tics and banal stuttering began to grate the nerves after the first hour or so, and cruise's character wasn't so much a character as he was a composite of all the previous antagonists in mann's ouevre - but everyone seemed to have a grip on what the script and screenwriter considered a character.  it was in all honesty great fun to watch tom cruise execute people in such detached precision, and i'm never one to object the mass extermination of nameless ancillary characters written for the sole purpose of being murdered in aesthetically stimulating ways.  as a matter of fact my enjoyment was thorough and unquestionable up until the point when an audioslave song came on, then i remembered precisely why i disliked michael mann movies.  mann lacks an acute sense that most great directors have and flaunt.  namely, he lacks control.  certainly, the way his movies move imply calculation, but upon further investigation one can see that tapestry of lies unravel and end up in frayed tatters on the floor.  he becomes intoxicated on his own style and over-indulges where he shouldn't.  he can't restrain himself properly and doesn't know his weak areas, and since this air of nobility pervades his person and he's looked on as some kind of icon nobody has the chutzpah to tell him otherwise.  he juggles so many things at once that he's like a drunk trying to compose himself, but he's so inebriated that he can't maintain his balance.  so instead of giving up we see him fumble and fit all over the pavement.      mann's incompetence as a director would be forgivable were it not for the unmitigated absurdity of the climax.  the very instant that foxx discovered smith was to be the next target, i lost would little faith i had invested in the movie.  it had led me to believe that it was an anomoly, that it wasn't just your standard ho-hum action movie, and then i get a ridiculous david mamet-like plot twist thrust under my nose that renders me incapable of doing anything but scoffing at the final moments of the movie.  the people responsible for the movie are requiring that i suspend too much of my intelligence by inferring that i should:  a) presume a sensible human being engaged in freelanceassassination would prefer to rely on a cabbie as his transportation, making him easily susceptible to detection (especially when he's done it before)  b) hear audioslave and not laugh uproariously (which i did immediately after hearing one of their awful \\"ballads\\" in one of the scenes)  c) see jada pinkett smith and not desparately wish her immense physical harm  d) put aside the fact that tom cruise executed an entire nightclub while breakdancing with his hands behind his back, pulling the trigger with his tongue and aiming the gun with his aquiline beak, but couldn't hit one man at point blank range on a subway car, and that in turn said man (who is considerably unexperienced with firearms) could land one kill shot on him in an exchange of gunfire    this movie didn't challenge my expectations in the least.  it was formulaic, predictable, hard to discern from pretty much every jerry bruckheimer flick i've ever seen in my life, and eventually devolved into an audioslave music video.  however, if you're the sort of person that requires his cinema only provide him/her with the lowest modicum of entertainment, then collateral should do suitably, for it is entertaining - just not what i wanted at this particular moment, especially after seeing cruise expand his acting chops in the criminally ignored and defamed \\"magnolia.\\"    oh yes, the master auteur otherwise known as mann is remaking miami vice for the big screen.  i'm sure this is absolutely necessary.
0670033375|3.0|The book has mostly excellent chapters and subsections, but several of them seem perfunctory.  The author's repetitive, mundane style is nothing to write home about, even if the garbage in that home contains 12,123 chicken bones, 2,000 ham bones, and 234 lamb bones. [This book is packed with information about such matters.]<br /><br />I found the discussions of Pitcairn, Easter Island, Australia and Hispanola particularly strong.  Most benefitted by Diamond's personal experience with those places.  All of them had information embedded in well-developed historical contexts and fascinating details that were new and delightful.  The section on China was strange, and out of place.  It read like Diamond sat down with a book on statistics and converted the info into text.  No big picture here, just dullness.  For some reason the opening chapter on Montana lacked any hooks for me, and I just could not get interested in it.  Ditto for the Anasazi chapter.  The Maya section was fairly strong.<br /><br />The closing section of the book, a kind of synthesis and overview, more of an interpretive effort, I found useless.  Like a really long editorial that showed no promise of enlightenment, or entertainment.  I think that brought the book down at least a full star.<br /><br />So, the book is uneven, and has the usual Diamond \\"bloat\\".  He is no John McPhee, definitely not a master of the deft, concise phrase.  His writing lacks any particular charm and could really use more editing.  His explanation of how cross-matching in dendrochronology goes on for perhaps a page, when a small paragraph would have done the trick.
630018403X|1.0|Sometime between 1967 and 1970 pictures started to stink more and more. But for about 15 more years at least they had solid storyline. Then in 1985 with the premiere of the Brat-Pack pictures (beginning with this one)pictures sucked and no longer had solid storyline. As for this film. I rest my case. The story which is (only!!!) about teenagers in detention wouldn't have made a z-picture in Hollywood back in the 1950's. As for the dialogue well, it's weird to say the least. The film is pretty pointless!

Leonardo Dicarpo plays Howard a guy that builds planes and then he would make movies!!!!! I love movies about people in history,but i didn't like the person Leo had to play they should have had someone else play him and i wish that it was better then what i saw!!!!!!

B00000JNNY|5.0|At Last!  The digitally remastered release with bonus tracks is this one, so you don't need the Essential Etta James, this is it, and it is truly essential.  I personally can't live without this album in regular rotation; it's a superb pick-me-up that just grabs your heart from the get-go and keeps you smiling and grooving all the way through.  At last! showcases Etta's power as the hottest blues diva on the 60's circuit, and along with Etta James Rocks the House you've got two of the best CDs ever put out in blues and R&B .  She'll rock your house till it rolls right over; these tunes have stood the test of time and should be on everyone's most played lists.
B00097DX3U|5.0|The members of Audioslave have proved that they are here...and they're here to stay.  <br /> <br />Where to begin? Out of Exile is a must have.A more mature yet rocking Audioslave is presented in 'out of exile'. Audioslave fans will love it, and if you're new to Audioslave you will love it! <br /> <br /> <br />The lyrics along with Soundgarden former vocalist's voice perfectly fuses with RATM former members music.  <br /> <br /> <br /> Your Time Has come: This is a great song,  very catchy, strong message and with a great rhythm. If you liked \\"Cochise\\" you will certainly love this song. <br /> <br />Out of Exile is great, love the lyrics, and simple yet rocking.The drumming gets you tapping your feet and you just want to belt it out along with Cornell <br /> <br />Be Yourself, we all know this song, and its absolutely brilliant. If you liked it, you'll like the rest of the album.Really great nostalgic song and gotta love the background wahs wahs.  <br /> <br /> <br />Doesn't remind me is emotionally strong. I certainly recommend it. <br /> <br /> <br />Drown Me Slowly - A full out rocker remininscent of set it off, shadow in the sun. It gets your adrenaline pumping  <br />and screaming along. Fans of RATM rejoice, Morello brings back  <br />the scratching solo. ...a masterpiece.  <br /> <br />Heaven's Dead - Wow this is an amazing heartfelt beautiful ballad. The lyrics are really expressive and definitely paints pictures with its words to whomever may be listening. Just lay back and enjoy the smooth sailing and luscious scenery.  <br /> <br />The Worm - Another favorite of mine - a full out rocker that begs to be listened to at max volume (even at the risk of your neighbors calling the police). You gotta love that opening riff and the guitar breaks where Cornell just wails.  <br /> <br />Man Or Animal - A quick paced really FAST song.The drums really make this song stand out. Listen to this song when  <br />you're in your car.  <br /> <br />Yesterday To Tomorrow - Iforgot to mention Timmy C. He always  <br />breathes life into songs with his bass lines. Morello and Timmy is one of the best guitar/bass duos in rock history. They just mesh  <br />so well together and make the songs work. I love the bridge  <br />of this nostalgic ballad and how he brings out the 'feeling' of  <br />this song.  <br /> <br />Dandelion -  Very very different from their other songs, but in a good way. Reminds me of the kind of songwriting you would hear from Cornell's solo album but only that this is 10x better.  <br /> <br /> <br />#1 Zero - This is \\"THE\\" groundbreaking song of the album. I haven't heard a song this good in the last 3 years alone. This is destined to be  <br />a classic or of legendary status for slave', RATM, or Soundgarden fans.  <br />Everything, I MEAN EVERYTHING about this song is groundbreaking - the lyrics, vocals, songwriting, guitarwork (wow Morello you ROCK)  <br />the song structure, the riff - you name it, it's there. I get orgasms from  <br />listening to this song and I didn't know that this was even possible   <br /> <br />The Curse - a good song but just ok. Nothing extraordinary yet better than most of whats out there right now. <br /> <br />Over all I think that Out of Exile is the best album that any of the 4 members have ever done in their whole music career (not just together as Audioslave). I cannot and will not compare it to the previous self-titled album because they are both great and different at a time. The members have matured in this album, however, Out Of Exile covers all the bases of rock. From the hard stuff (The Worm) to the soft, easy and smooth stuff (Dandelion). The album is a great mix of the band members talents. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
0743454537|5.0|Before I bought this book, it'd been weeks since I read anything new.  Nothing interested me.  I saw this at Borders, and from the moment I started reading, I was hooked.  A great, moving story.  Well written.  Sad ending.  It actually made me cry, and a book that does that...  I can't forget.  I'm going to read some of the author's other books, I think.

B0000508U6|5.0|It's fashionable for people to backlash and dismiss a popular band just because it gets lots of air-play and too much hype, but don't make this mistake with Coldplay. Even after five years since their debut album Parachutes, the songs, dripping with beautiful melancholy, keep their power. Seamless and assured, the songs collectively make the album a pop music masterpiece, paving the way for a new label, \\"emotional rock.\\" It doesn't hurt that my favorite Coldplay song, \\"Sparks,\\" is on this album but I would still love the album even in the absence of that tender song. Thankfully, the band Keane has been carrying the torch of Coldplay's brand of emotional rock.

B0007TKNIS|1.0|Sound track comes in and out. If I adjust my speakers for the silent parts, then I damage my speakers when the sound returns at a very high level. Mybe I got a bad version.
B00097A5I6|4.0|As someone who thinks Heathen Chemistry is a great album, I find this less a return to form, as it's generally being hailed, but as a continuation of this return. Always embracing their influences, I  can hear plenty of traces of (of course) The Beatles, but also the Stones and an outro reminiscent to Mrs. Robinson in the song Lyla.<br /><br />This is strong, confident, BIG rock and roll, and the songs are fantastic.<br /><br />The difference between 4 and 5 stars for me is this: The lyrics are uniformly strong, but don't really take it to the next level. The biggest example is the use of the phrase \\"Blowin' my mind.\\" Three songs in a row use this phrase: Mucky Fingers (\\"All the phoneys blowin my mind\\"), Lyla \\"I waited for a thousand years for you to come and blow me out my mind\\"), and Love Like a Bomb (\\"Blown' my mind, Blowin' my mind, Blowin' my mind\\"). This isn't a bad lyric in any of the songs, but the non-thematic repetition of this same phrase lessens the scope, for me, of the album as a whole. Perhaps spacing the songs out, or defining the album in such a way as to indicate the link between this repetition would have helped.<br /><br />Nevertheless, \\"The Importance of Being Idle\\" is an absolute stunner, immediately one of the great Oasis songs. In fact, all of Noel's songs shine the brightest. He's writing and especially singing as well as he ever has. Truly, truly, an excellent album, worthy of the high praise it's receiving in all circles.
B00005LC6Z|5.0|John Carpenter's HALLOWEEN scared millions of people back in 1978. It was filmed on $300,000 budget in the course of three weeks in the Spring of 1978. But in 1981, director Rick Rosenthal, with the help of original HALLOWEEN producers, John Carpenter (director of the first film) & Debra Hill, brought us HALLOWEEN 2. <br /> <br />    Filmed in 1981, but picking up on October 31st, 1978, where LAURIE STRODE (again played by Jamie Lee Curtis) has been rescued by DR. SAM LOOMIS (again played by Donald Pleasance), Michael gets up on walks away, for he has not yet finished, nor will he ever be finished, his business in Haddonfield. Laurie is found by the police and ambulance and is taken to safety at the Haddonfield Hospital to be treated for her stab wounds and fractured ankle. <br /> <br />    MICHAEL MYERS (played by Dick Warlock) is still at large. He wanders into the Elrod's place, steals a kitchen knife and goes on his way. But his blood left on the cutting board scares the hell out of Mrs. Elrod, causing her to scream in front. ALICE (played by Anne Bruner), The Elrod's next-door neighbor, comes out, concerned, but realizes that it is probably nothing major, but in Alice's case, it is, since Michael appears kills her off. <br /> <br />    Earlier, Laurie was taken to the hospital by two paramedics named BUD (played by Leo Rossi) and JIMMY (played by Lance Guest), who is the older brother of one of Laurie's classmates. At the hospital, DR. FREDRICK MIXTER (played by FORD RAINY) requires that she be put under the gas for rest, but Laurie is so terrified that she does not want to sleep, but the Dr. goes against her wishes. <br /> <br />    Dr. Loomis has already caught up with SHERIFF LEIGH BRACKETT (again played by Charles Cyphers). They search the whole neighborhood for Michael. They found a supposed Michael Myers. As they chase him, Michael walks into the street, where is he rammed by a police car and slammed into a truck, where he and the truck explodes. Theguy in Myers' mask was not Michael Myers. At that moment, DEPUTY HUNT (played by Hunter Von Leer) drives up and tells Brackett about the three kids murdered in Lindsey Wallace's house, and reveals that one of them is Annie, Leigh's daughter, and Laurie's best friend. They pull up, and Brackett looks at his daughter one last time, and storms off, pissed at Loomis for supposedly letting Michael escape, in which, Dr. Loomis hadn't done so. Hunt decides to help Dr. Loomis out in this ordeal. <br /> <br />    Awhile later, Jimmy is talking to Laurie about what happened. He reveals that the guy trying to kill her tonight was Michael Myers. She is shocked to learn this, since she has heard about Michael killing his older sister 15 years earlier. She realizes that she last heard that he was locked up, but Jimmy tells Laurie that Michael did escape. <br /> <br />    Awhile later, Bud and his girlfriend, KAREN (played by Pamela Susan Shoop), a nurse on the maternity floor, are in the physical therapy tub, but Bud gets out to check the temperature, after Michael had turned up to the hottest temp. There, Michael strangles Bud, but Karen doesn't hear a thing. Michael walks in and drowns Karen in the burning hot water. <br /> <br />    Dr. Loomis and Hunt find out that the guy blown up earlier was definitely not Michael, but a 17-year-old boy named, Bennett Tramer. They continue their quest for Michael, until MARION CHAMBERS (again played by Nancy Stephens), the nurse who was with Dr. Loomis last night, arrives to tell him that the governor of Smith's Grove has ordered Loomis back to Smith's Grove. Dr. Loomis and Marion walk out to the car, where a marshal will drive them along. He asks Hunt to continue the search. <br /> <br />    At the Hospital, Laurie escapes her hospital room, sending Jimmy and JILL (played by TAWNY MOYER), who is the hospital's receptionist, on the hunt for Laurie. While searching for Laurie, Jimmy finds MRS. ALVES (played by Gloria Gifford), the head nurse, dead. Jimmy trips and cracks his head open. <br /> <br />    Jill tries to leave, but can't since every cars' tires are flat. She enters the hospital and finds Laurie walking around, where Laurie witnesses Michael kill Jill. Laurie runs down into the basement, finding the security guard, MR. GARRETT (played by Cliff Emmich) dead. Michael finds her, but Laurie gets on the elevator, leaves the hospital and hides in the car. <br /> <br />    Back with Dr. Loomis and Marion, Marion reveals to Dr. Loomis that Laurie Strode is actually, Michael Myers' younger sister. Laurie was born two years before Michael murdered Judith. Two years after his crime, after their parents died, Laurie was adopted by the Strode's. They had requested that this piece of evidence be sealed to protect the family. Dr. Loomis orders the marshal to turn around, in which he does. <br /> <br />    Laurie exits the car after seeing Michael again. She runs up to the Hospital door and tries to open it, but it's locked. Dr. Loomis lets her in. He shoots Michael again, but he kills the Marshall and chases Laurie and Loomis, as Marion calls for backup. They enter a gas room, where Laurie shoots Michael's eyes. Dr. Loomis tells Laurie to get out of there, as he turns on gas tanks and blows up the room, burning Michael. Laurie has done it again. <br /> <br />    This film is just as scary as the first film and very enjoyable. Jamie Lee Curtis will always be the original Scream Queen. Her screams sound just as great as they did in the original, but I feel as though, hearing scream for the first time in the original will always be the best. This is a worthy follow-up to John Carpenter's original horror masterpiece.
B000003CMB|5.0|I actually own this CD and can truthfully give 5 stars.  This is a true classic -- probably their best.  In response to Fred Dursts Numba One Fann posting, not that anyone would actually take a 17 year old, Hippity Hoppity loving, goober's review with any seriousness, this Allman Brothers classic has already stood the test of time and will be around long after Fred Dursts Numba One Fann hits puberty (in about 10 years +).  Of course, if youv'e never even heard of the Allman Brothers, this may not be for you.  And besides, \\"they've never even been on MTV\\".
0192833669|3.0|Frankenstein was... interesting. It made me think more about what would happen if we could create life. And I definitely appreciate OUR Creater more now! But I didn't really enjoy it very much. It was stilted and painful, and I'm not really into this genre anyway. But I'm glad I read it, if only to know the real story.<br /><br />SPOILER WARNING!<br /><br />The book starts off with a series of letters from a man named Robert Walton to his sister. They tell her about his adventures in Russia, getting ready to sail, and then sailing into the North. Robert is determined to succeed in his exploration, but he is weakened by his strong desire for a true friend to share this dream come true with. Then his wish is granted: the ship picks up a man on a sledge. He is almost dead, but an eager Robert Walton takes care of him, and lavishes him with attention. Eventually the stranger decides to tell Robert his life story.<br /><br />His name is Victor Frankenstein.<br /><br />The first few chapters detail his family background: his parents and how they met, their travels, and their adoption of a child named Elizabeth. Frankenstein grew up with Elizabeth as one of his dearest friends, (even more than a sister). His other close friend was a boy named Henry.<br /><br />Growing up, Frankenstein shows a great deal of interest in science and magic. After his mother's death, he goes to university, and after much study, discovers the secret of life, which is not made known in the book. Frankenstein creates a 'being' immediately is repulsed and horrified, runs away in fright, and then goes mad with fever. Luckily his friend Henry is there to take care of him, and Elizabeth faithfully writes him with all the news of home, including the story of a servant girl named Justine, who is loved in the home. When Frankenstein recovers, he goes on a vacation with Henry, and finally is happy again. But his happiness is not to last for long.<br /><br />Frankenstein receives a letter telling of his younger brothers death at the hands of a murderer. He catches a glimpse of the being he created soon after, and knows that he is the culprit. But Justine has been accused of the murder, and is condemned to death, and there is nothing he can do about it.<br /><br />Frankenstein goes for a hike, and meets the Creature, who asks him to listen to his story. It is a sad one, of a Creature learning to survive in a world where everyone hates him for his ugliness. It's fairly long, detailing his observations of a family, learning to read and talk, and his ultimate rejection by those he loves, sending him over the brink into rage. Finally the Creature asks Frankenstein to make him a girlfriend, saying they will go far away and never bother Frankenstein anymore.<br /><br />Frankenstein decides to do what The Creature asks of him, and travels to England and Scotland to get the necesary information. In a small cottage in Scotland he begins the dirty work, and is about halfway there, upset and discouraged when he sees the Creature again. Horror filled thoughts flood his mind, and in a fit he rips up the girlfriend, leaving her in pieces on the floor. The Creature threatens to kill him and says 'I will be there on your wedding night.' Frankenstein has made up his mind, however, and sets sail, dumping the pieces of girlfriend overboard. He is blown off course, though, and ends up in a small village in Ireland, where he is accused of murder.<br /><br />The Creature has killed his best friend, Henry, and Frankenstein is accused of it. What does Frankenstein do? Goes into another mad fever.<br /><br />When things work out, and Frankenstein is better, he goes home and decides to marry Elizabeth, even though he often thinks of the Creature's wedding night warning. And it happens: Elizabeth is killed that night, his father dies from shock, and Frankenstein is thought mad. HFinally Frankenstein has had enough, and is filled with revenge. e pursues the Creature all over the world, and eventually to the North, where his strength gave out and he met Robert Walton. At the end of his story, he begs Robert to kill the Creature for him.<br /><br />Robert Walton's ship is stuck in the ice. His men mutiny peacefully, and force him to agree to turn back when they get un-stuck. Frankenstein protests, because he NEEDS to get the Creature, but it is no use. He dies. Robert finds the Creature in  Frankenstein's room, upset over the dead body. Robert accuses him of ruining Frankenstein's life, which is pretty obvious! The Creature decides to end it all, and says he's going to burn himself up.<br /><br />And that's the end.orld, and eventually to the North, where his strength gave out and he met Robert Walton. At the end of his story, he begs Robert to kill the Creature for him. <br /> <br />Robert Walton's ship is stuck in the ice.

B00070Q7VO|5.0|I bought this album for one reason and one only.  I heard the song \\"Home\\" on the radio and had to have it.  I had kind of heard of Michael Buble', but really didn't think I'd enjoy his CD.  Boy, was I wrong.  Every cut on this album is wonderful and very special.  Definitely can call them his own, because they're so different from the original versions.  I'm a big fan now and want his other CD's.  Don't miss this one.  He has a beautiful, pure voice.
B00003CXDD|5.0|I first watched this as a very small child, and it has remained one of my favorites ever since.  This movie sparked my imagination and started my great love for science-fiction reading.  Some of my acquaintances have found it to be corny, but I think this is a great family movie.  Those of you that have enjoyed the Harry Potter series will also enjoy Willow.
1558908382|4.0|Grosse Pointe Blank (Released 1997) (Rated: R) <br /> <br />Cast: <br />John Cusack <br />Minnie Driver <br />Alan Arkin <br />Joan Cusack <br />Dan Aykroyd <br />Jeremy Piven <br />K. Todd Freedman <br />Hank Azaria <br />Benny Urquidez <br /> <br />Summary: <br />Cusack plays the professional killer, Martin Blank. He is sent on a job that takes him to his hometown of Grosse Pointe, Colorado. He is conviced by his secretary, played by Cusack's sister, Joan, to go to his high school reunion. This leads him to find his high school girlfriend, (Minnie Driver) who he abandoned on prom night ten years ago. The whole while he is being tracked by two federal agents and two other assassins. <br /> <br />Review: <br />I really liked this movie. It was a strange mix of bloody violence and hilarious dry humor that had me rolling around on the floor. Cusack's acting was very good. Alan Arkin's character, Blank's therapist, was amazing. The two federal agents (Freedman and Azaria) were both well developed characters, but were killed rather suddenly towards the end. Benny Urquindez (an impressive matrial artist) played the assassin Felix LaPubelle. The other killer was played by Aykroyd. John's old friend offered comic relief during some serious scenes. He was played by Piven. <br /> <br />Overall, I'd give this movie 4/5. I highly recomend it for everyone... except those who don't like gore.
B000002JKA|4.0|I believe Dream Theatre is exceptionally talented and deserves this fully. I am here to protect this masterwork band from MTV rocks. <br />  MTV rocks, in case you haven't noticed MTV is a station completely overrun by conformist swine have no real mind of their own, and have to rely on musical retards to tell them what is quality music is. <br />    <br />     I read some of your reviews and you said \\"Bands like Good Charlotte and Simple plan teach us how to cope with real life problems.\\" You cannot be serious. IN one of their songs they talk about stealing from rich people. Is that the way to cope with our problems, by stealing? Further more they are not good guitar players. Their songs consist of ONLY simple chord progressions a chimp could easily accomplish. <br />  <br />     Please don't tell me you actually like Ashlee Simpson. In one of your pieces you stated \\"I saw a picture with her holding a guitar, so that means she must be an awesome player.\\" Well, I once had a picture taken in an astronaut's helmet, therefore I most pirate space. WRONG, PICTURES MEAN NOTHING, EVEN IF SHE CAN PLAY SHE MUST BE TERRIBLE, but it could not possibly be as bad as her lyrics or voice. MTV rocks reconsider your thoughts about Ashlee Simpson. <br />    <br />    Just because something isn't shown on MTV 24/7 doesn't mean it is bad. In fact most music on MTV is flat out horrible. If you take notice, on TRL the people requesting songs have no legitimate reason to like that song, they simply say \\"I wanted Avril Lavigne because she's hot, she can butter my muffin anytime, I'm a conformist with no mind of my own, ect. They never ever ever ever ever give a good reason to like the song other than \\"becaus they are hot.\\" <br />    <br />   And for the record stop saying Linkin Park, Limp Bisquet, Korn, and Evanescence are metal bands, THEY ARE NOT!!!!!! THEY ARE NOT METAL YOU FOOL! EVANESSANCE IS A GOTH LESBIAN GROUP, LIMP BISQUET AND KORN ARE ACID RAP, AND LINKIN PARK IS A SORT OF ALTROCK GROUP. <br />     <br />    When I read you thoughts on Joe Satriani I nearly threw my computer of the roof. He is an awesome guitar player. Unlike the simple cords you think are so awesome (I could play Nirvana crap after a month and a half) Joe Satriani, Iron Maiden, W.A.S.P, Metallica, and other TRUE metal bands are mind boggling with their minor pentatonic scale based flurries. What you classify as awesome guitar is simple simple simple. <br />  <br />      Black Sabbath is the beginning of true metal, not Limp Bisquet (who isn't even metal). I loved Ozzy when he was in Sabbath and when he was making solo albums. You obviously have no radar to detect true latent. <br />    I RECOMEND YOU BUY DREAM THEATRE AND ANYTHING ELSE MTV rocks SAYS SUCKS. AND BURN AND DESTROY ANYHTING HE LIKES <br />
0061020710|4.0|When I years ago decided to start reading the Discworld series, I started with this book. However, I lost interest after less than five pages. Later, when my interest for the Discworld series reawoke, I found out that you didn't have to start with this book. You could also choose Equal Rites, Mort (which I chose) or other books. After reading six Discworld books I decided to give this one a try. I quickly noticed that it's not nearly as funny as the other books, but still is worth reading thanks to it's interesting story. However, it's not the kind of \\"one-big-laugh-per-page\\" that I'm used to from the other discworld books, but instead an adventure book with jokes here and there. The reason it can be called a humourous book is not a big amount of jokes, but instead the non-serious theme. To put it short: <br />If you are planning to start reading the discworld books, read Mort, Equal Rites or Guards! Guards! instead, or perhaps Moving Pictures. But don't start with this book. For the discworld books are ridiculous and funny, but this book is more adventurous than funny, and would give you an untruthful impression of the Discworld series. Still, it is a very good book, and you should by all means read it, oh yes. Just read Mort or Equal Rites first.
B00097A5I6|4.0|Some people might be impressed by the fact that Oasis is still making music. But really, when you consider Jerry Rice--arguably the greatest to ever play his position--is still playing in the NFL, laughably, as a third- or fourth-string receiver, what's truly impressive is that Oasis is still great. Their level of greatness varies from fan to fan, sure; with some fans believing they've been on the downfall since Definitely Maybe. Definitely not. Everything that has been present during their careers is present here, at one point or another. There is the undeniably memorable hooks in Noel's voice which first brought Oasis their stardom and US radio play (\\"Lyla\\", \\"Let There Be Love\\") as well as the ever-present rock sluggishness that makes their albums so lovable (\\"The Importance Of Being Idle\\", \\"The Meaning Of Soul\\"). There isn't a bad song on Don't Believe The Truth, although if you looked hard enough you could probably find something to complain about. And since you're going to see the line 'don't believe the naysayers' (or something to that effect) in every positive review for this album, I'll refrain from doing so.<br /><br />The opener here, \\"Turn Up The Sun\\", starts things off nicely with a booming sound and a seemingly agitated tone in Noel's voice--something that has always worked well for Oasis (e.g. Be Here Now) and also works well throughout this album. \\"Mucky Fingers\\" is a rather weird track. It holds a steady beat for the entire song, as well as almost-humorous lyrics and terrific harmonica bits. \\"Lyla\\" is everything you'd come to expect from an Oasis single. The way Noel's voice is molded around the drumming and strumming easily makes it one of the album's highlights. \\"Love Like A Bomb\\" should get most of its praise for the subdued chants of 'yer blowin my mind' midway through the song. Next we have \\"The Importance Of Being Idle\\", my personal favorite song. Not only do the lyrics fit my life to a T ('I can't get a life if my heart's not in it' or 'I guess I'm just lazy'), but Noel's voice is at its most excellent while he goes from low- to high-pitched in an instance (and beautifully). And the marching band-like beat is appealing in its own, eerie way. Next, I found it kind of odd that \\"The Meaning Of Soul\\" only lasted a minute, 42 seconds, when the word 'soul' seems to emerge in every song on the album. But whatever the case may be, the song is actually very, very good and one of the top five on the album. \\"Guess God Thinks I'm Abel\\" starts off slow, but becomes magical once they start in with: 'no one could break us / no one could take us if they tried'. The next three tracks (\\"Part Of The Queue\\", \\"Keep The Dream Alive\\", \\"A Bell Will Ring\\"), in all honesty, are all average Oasis tracks. They all have their ups and their downs, while none of them compare to the epic \\"Let There Be Love\\", which is probably the best song on Don't Believe The Truth. The lyrics are tremendous, and while the music may appear to be rather one-dimensional, the simplicity works. It is a lovely song, right up there with the best of Oasis.<br /><br />This record is comparable to all of Oasis' albums, most notably Heathen Chemistry; as there are a fair number of stand-out tracks and an equal number of average tracks. It is consistent rock music all the way through, although you will notice I said \\"Noel's voice\\" a whole bunch of times. That's because it is indeed his voice that makes or breaks each song. And while you may not love every song like a \\"Wonderwall\\" or a \\"Don't Go Away\\", you aren't going to find a bad song. Sure, you can skip over a couple of tracks here and there without feeling bad about it. But you cannot deny Oasis the respect they deserve for releasing such a terrific album. You can't break 'em. You can't take 'em. And if you try or succeed in doing so, you're not an Oasis fan.

0062502182|2.0|Great writing does not have to be complicated, verbose, or redundant. Unfortunately, Paulo Coelho did not succeed in moving me whatsoever in his simplistic,to the point and often -annoyingly- repetitive prose.<br /><br />In my opinion, and I know my voice is one of the minority, the writing was the downfall of the book.<br /><br />It's simplistic plot-a young spanish man who embarks on a journey to follow his dream, literally, of finding a hidden treasure- gives a sense of fun and optimism, which elicits a sense of urgency to the reader to keep flipping the pages in order to find out what might happen next; it's charming and endearing characters warms your heart; and it's symbolism within the characters and the environment that surrounds them could have all contributed to make The Alchemist a great book. \\"COULD HAVE BEEN\\" are the key words because the book is not a great book nor a particularily a good one, it's mediocre at best. The reason you ask? The writing is simply awful. Like the top reviewer accurately wrote: the reading level is that of a 4th or 5th grader and mind-numbingly repetitive. And how could you take a book with such a low reading level seriously or give it anything more than a shallow, silly, yet fun read.<br /><br />If there is anything worse than the writing, it's the author's attempt at making the book a deep, and life-altering read of consequence and enlightenment-please. Dr.Sues would put this book to shame with only one of his books.<br /><br />Read the Alchemist to satisfy your curiosity. Otherwise, do not bother. Sorry folks, I did not enjoy writing this review anymore than you liked reading a bad review on one of the supposed classics of our time.
B000000H6D|5.0|This album is a true gothic metal mastepiece without a doubt. Christian Woman, Black No.1, Too Late/Frozen, Kill All The White People, We Hate Everyone, Summer Breeze, Set Me On Fire, and Bloody Kisses are my favorite songs on here. Peter Steele's vocals are just great. Kenny Hickey has some cool guitar riffs, and Josh Silver's keyboards really gives this album that beautiful atmospheric sound. There's some good drumming as well. So if you're new to Type O Negative, Bloody Kisses along with October Rust are great albums to start with. Type O Negative rules!<br /><br />Ratings:<br /><br /> 1. Machine Screw: N/A<br /><br /> 2. Christian Woman: 5/5<br /><br /> 3. Black No.1: 5/5<br /><br /> 4.

B000002UA9|4.0|It is fitting that the first Beatles album to be released in the United Kingdom begins with a Paul McCartney and John Lennon penned song, \\"I Saw Her Standing There.\\" This song led the remaining 14 and helped keep this album atop the British charts for a record 30 weeks, a record that I believe still stands. Ironically, this album was toppled by \\"With the Beatles.\\" This song is one of the rockers from this album that is raw, and yet very enjoyable.<br /><br />The second song begins in a manner similar to some other British rock groups of the time. \\"Misery\\" has harmonies and styles that are a bit more derivative than most of the other music on this album. This song also features a brief but clearly noticeable piano, which is uncharacteristic of the typical Beatles sound in their early years.<br /><br />The third song is relatively unremarkable. \\"Anna (Go to Him)\\" contains some Beatles elements, but is otherwise a throwaway song. The third song was written by Gerald Goffin and Carole King. \\"Chains\\" is a relatively unsophisticated pop song that is below average for this album. In yet another irony, Goffin and King also wrote a number of songs for the Monkees, including hits. \\"Boys\\" was also written by other artists, and is yet another unremarkable pop song. The next song is \\"Ask Me Why,\\" which was written by McCartney and Lennon and contains many of the features that makes Beatles songs so enjoyable, though it is difficult to precisely define what that feature is. Later in the album is \\"Baby It's You,\\" which sounds like a 50s leftover. \\"A Taste of Honey\\" is uncharacteristic for the Beatles, sounding like a completely different group. The latter two songs were covers.<br /><br />The seventh song is one of the standout songs on this CD. \\"Please Please Me\\" is wonderfully written and performed. A harmonica is effectively used to provide a unique sound to this pop love song. The effective use of guitars and vocals make this short (2:03) song feel longer and more complex. The first time this song was released it went no where. The second time the song went to #3. This song remains a classic rock standard.<br /><br />The next song is yet another of those songs that helped define the Beatles. \\"Love Me Do\\" is a simple love song that uses vocals and a harmonica to expand the depth of the music. The singable lyrics and catchy pop hooks made this song a sure winner and another classic in the Beatles catalog, reaching #1 in the charts.<br /><br />Many groups struggle to have even a single great song. The Beatles had several excellent songs on this album. \\"P.S. I Love You\\" was a wonderful song that was easily better than most of the pop of the era. This song could have been a hit single had it been released in the U.S.<br /><br />\\"Do You Want to Know a Secret\\" achieved #2 or #3, depending on the chart. This song is relatively simple, but pretty. This song is also very short at just under two minutes. Showing that even McCartney and Lennon had clunkers is \\"There's a Place.\\" I find it difficult to recommend this song. The vocals sound strained, and the music is neither innovative nor remarkable.<br /><br />This CD closes with \\"Twist and Shout.\\" This song reached #2 or #1, depending on the chart. A rarity for the covers on this CD, this song is well done and does the Isley Brothers credit. The Beatles make it their own with a rendition that makes this song one of a Beatles classic.<br /><br />The initial impression you get from hearing this CD is that the music is relatively unrefined. You can also get the impression that this was a group of energetic young guys with far more talent than skill. The most amazing thing is to listen to the evolution of the Beatles from this 1963 release to \\"Rubber Soul,\\" \\"Revolver,\\" and \\"Sgt. Pepper.\\" It is incredible how quickly this group matured from a talented group of boys to the most influential rock group in history.<br /><br />The Beatles actually had a bit of a rough start before their music became popular,but once it did it was unstoppable. Even those singles released from this early album were competing with each other on the charts, which would continue for the next few years as Beatlemania swept the country, and then the world.heir music became popular, but once it did it was unstoppable.

B0000AQS0F|5.0|This show is, well what can I say, fantastic might be a word, or a better one might be shiny.  I would recomend watching it, then watching it again and making other people watch it with you.  Not that you will really have to make them after about halfway through the first episode. <br />I also hear tell of a movie coming out soon.  So watch that too.  Cause it will be shiny too, I'm sure.
B0001ZX204|4.0|When you're a member of KISS, a band that has gotten the reputation as \\"The hottest band in the world\\" (a reputation that not even The Beatles or The Stones ever got)and You're still popular when you've been around for thirty-two years, You're going to make new music, right? For KISS, the answer to that question is no. Like The Beatles and AC/DC, KISS has proved to be a legendary band, and while they will probably always be popular and have their place in the hearts of most people,still, unless the band makes a new studio album, fans of the band will probably still have the complaint they have had for a while.........there are too many KISS compilations available! I am a huge fan of the band, but I agree about there being too many KISS compilations out there. But even though \\"They Very Best of KISS\\" happens to be ANOTHER compilation by the band, it lives up to the album title. Read on for my review of this:  <br /> <br />This album takes a thorough look at KISS. Most of the material on here is here is 70's material, but that is what most fans request for greatest hits compilations, so that is OK. I liked KISS' music videos in the 80's better than I liked the videos they made in the 70's and 90's, but my favorite music from KISS is definitely the 70's material. KISS has always been a band that is about fun, good times, and rock 'n roll, and occasionally there are songs by the band about \\"having fun\\". Everything KISS is about shows in their music, which is why they are such a great band. The 70's material selected here were all excellent selections. Unfortunately, KISS doesn't have the honor of being one of the bands that saved rock and killed disco (hence, the song \\"I Was Made For Lovin' You\\")but they do have the honor of being one of the biggest rock bands of all time. I wasn't alive during the whole disco craze,but I don't care for some of the new music that is being released today, so I like getting to put in a CD from a band I like when I don't like most of the stuff (I'm a huge Velvet Revolver fan)that has made it's way on to the radio.  <br /> <br />Lastly, Ace Frehley's excellent cover version of Hello's \\"New York Groove\\" was included on this album, and three songs from the 80's line-up of KISS (\\"I Love It Loud\\", \\"Lick It Up\\", and \\"Forever\\")as well as a touching tribute to late KISS drummer Eric Carr (RIP),\\"God Gave Rock 'n Roll To You II\\", an Argent tune KISS did a sequel to in the early 90's. A very good compilation, but this loses a star for being another KISS compilation and also for not having the song \\"Tears Are Falling\\" on here. If you want a good, cheap (the group's 2001 self-titled box set costs over $50)look at KISS from the 70's to the 90's, pick up this compilation. You will probably get the good look at KISS you want, and there a few rare photos inside the album sheets.
B000268QB2|5.0|I haven't heard anything this good since the decades (50's--80's) when rock and roll songs actually meant something.  Every last song on this album speaks directly to my soul.  Highly recommended for anyone with a passion for meaningful music.
B00003CXCT|5.0|The original ending scene with the older actor (his name escapes me, sorry) who played Anakin/Vader after being \\"de-masked\\" makes no sense because, assuming your eyes are functioning correctly, you'll notice his face looks completely unblemished and scar-free.  Anakin was severely wounded/burned at the end of \\"Sith\\", when he was in his 20s.  Therefore it makes no sense to see the older vision of Anakin in his, say, 40s with no visible injury to his face and head - which is what is seen in the original ending scene in \\"Jedi\\".   <br /> <br />The new addition of Hayden Christiansen in this scene makes more sense continuity-wise because we see him the way he appeared just before turning to the dark side.  Some of Lucas's other changes can surely be second-guessed, but the more minor changes made for the sake of continuity make perfect sense.  (The same goes for the older Anakin's eyebrow erasures after the mask is taken off.)
B000002HPT|2.0|I love DT- but this album- is simply boring- Sherinian barly lifts a finger on this album- hardly displays his talents. HEavy song, soft song, heavy song, fast- uhhhhhhhh this album has nowhere NEAR the same replay value as their others.
B000002UVX|5.0|I picked up this CD a few weeks ago after hearing about the guitar performance, and the overall quality of this album recorded on New Years Eve 69/70, and i must i was not dissapointed in anyway.  Hendrix successfully makes the transition from psychadelic rock of the 60s to Funk based rock of the 70's, and gives inspiration to those to come. Hendrix teams up with Billy Cox(Bass), and Buddy Miles(Drums), on this psychadelic funky blend of music.  The album is filled with great riffs, (Who Knows, Changes) great soloing (especially on Machine Gun), as well as great rhythm with powerful basslines. After starting with an upbeat song that sounds like something from the Experience, Hendrix goes into Machine Gun, a song filled with anti-vietnam lyrics, and then jimi explodes into his \\"machine gun\\" like guitar solo.  Changes is probally the catchiest song on the album, and surely one of my favorites, with a great wah-wah riff and solo.  Power To Love has a very energetic solo, and a great driving bassline.  Message to Love and We gotta Live together finish off this album with much more funk influence than the previous tracks, and are great tracks.  This is definitely Hendrixes shining moment, as far as guitar playing goes on a live album, and it is definitely worth the buy.
B0002EXH5O|5.0|So what?  Remastered with updated vocals and changed lyrics... big deal, it's not like Mustaine's gonna magically pop out of nowhere to tell you he'll change it.  'Cause he won't.<br /><br />I'm sick of all the complaining, so I'm here to set the record straight... Mustaine remastered the classic albums, so now they all sound much better than they did... I just got my copy of Rust In Peace today and I absolutely love it!<br /><br />All heavy, all thrashy, just the way a masterpiece should sound, and is intended to be.<br /><br />So take advantage of it and enjoy!
B00097A5I6|4.0|Don't Believe the Truth may be Oasis's best album since What's the Story (Morning Glory)?  Following the trend of the last album, the sound is stripped down, more back-to-basics, unlike the bloated, noisy Be Here Now.  This time Oasis relies less on production tricks and multi-tracking and more on musicianship.  Noel Gallagher is right: the current band members are superior players to the original line-up (\\"Bonehead,\\" \\"Guigsy,\\" and McCarroll).  Zak Starkey - yep, Ringo's first-born - fills in admirably for Alan White who left and/or was kicked out of the band last year.<br /><br />It's almost impossible to talk about Oasis without talking about their stealing and borrowing from others, most notably the Beatles and the Stones.  This album, unlike others past, does not stand on the \\"shoulders of giants\\".  It is quite fresh.  If it sounds like anybody it sounds like Oasis.  That's not to say that Oasis did not dip from others' wells for inspiration.  \\"Mucky Fingers\\" is almost certainly intentionally lifted from \\"Come Together's\\" \\"monkey finger\\" bit.  \\"Let There Be Love\\" is actually a retooling of a great old Oasis song formerly known as \\"It's a Crime,\\" one of my favorite b-sides.  The similarities between \\"Let There Be Love\\" and Lennon's \\"Real Love\\" and \\"Love is Real\\" are undeniable.  Whatever the song suffers for being unoriginal it gains for being a duet Liam/Noel duet, each taking turns with alternating verses and choruses.  \\"Lyla,\\" the first single, does sound like \\"Street Fighting Man,\\" at least in the intro.  Beyond the intro, it's its own tune, with its own feel and energy.<br /><br />Reading the lyrics out of the liner notes they are iffy at best.  Poetry they're not.  But when sung they are adequate or better.  There are some great lyrics in spots.  Oasis has finally retreated a bit from their tendency to be lazy when rhyming (\\"liar/fire\\") and somewhat cliche (\\". . . stars . . . faded away. . .\\").  They did put some version of \\"blow my mind\\" in back-to-back-to-back songs on the album.  Before their lyrical weaknesses could all be pinned on Noel but not anymore.  Noel only wrote about half the songs.  Liam and Gem Archer wrote one together and Liam wrote two on his own.  Andy Bell wrote two songs.  The increasing contributions from the other members of the band, good or bad, has helped, on this and the last several albums, Oasis to expand their sound.  It probably accounts for less plagiarism.<br /><br />Here's a song-by-song review:<br /><br />\\"Turn Up the Sun\\" - Starts slow with a dark, sad feel.  It cranks up a bit and then ends like it started.  Instrumentally it's a solid song.  But it's not a single.  I would have opened the album with a better song.<br /><br />\\"Mucky Fingers\\" - A three-chord song that has a glam rock vibe.  Noel sings it/shouts it.  The harmonica and vocal style, as a friend of mine pointed out, sound like early electric Dylan.  \\"Mucky Fingers\\" may grow on you.<br /><br />\\"Lyla\\" - A catchy song.  It doesn't hurt that it sounds like \\"Street Fighting Man\\".  It is almost impossible not to like this song.  In my opinion, it's one of the best rock and roll songs of the last year, up there with \\"Vertigo\\" (U2) and \\"Holiday\\" (Green Day).<br /><br />\\"Love Like a Bomb\\" - Liam's best song on the album.  Maybe his best ever, though that's not saying a lot.  Some credit goes to Gem Archer as co-writer.  The opening strumming is not entirely unlike \\"Hide Your Love Away,\\" though it doesn't sound like a blatant rip-off.  It's updated psychedelia.<br /><br />\\"The Importance of Being Idle\\" - The best song on the album, bar none.  It's Noel at his best, lyrically and vocally.  Nice falsetto in the verses.  \\"Idle\\" is a stew of \\"Wouldn't it Be Nice,\\" \\"Being for the Benefit of Mr. Kite\\" and \\"Alabama Song\\".  I would buy this disk for this song alone.<br /><br />\\"The Meaning of Soul\\" - A Liam effort, this is a two-chord mix of 60's rock and 70's punk.<br /><br />\\"Guess God Thinks I'm Abel\\" - Another Liam-penned number.  It's a medium tempo, acoustic and stripped down.  Like so many Oasis songs, it has a positive message: \\"No one can break us if they try.\\"  It ends with a crash of the symbols and electronic noise.<br /><br />\\"Part of the Queue\\" - \\"Every beginning is breaking its promise,\\" is its best line.  Noel takes the lead vocal.  It opens with heavy drums and heavy acoustic strumming and gets warbly and psychedelic in the middle eight.<br /><br />\\"Keep the Dream Alive\\" - This is Andy Bell's second song on the album.  Great chorus and good guitar work.  It's not clear what dream they're keeping alive.  A nice effort.  Oasis penchant for anthemic songs (like \\"All Around the World\\") carries through to this song with its \\"na na na's\\" and proclamations.<br /><br />\\"A Bell Will Ring\\" - \\"A bell will ring inside your head\\" is, apparently, a good thing.  The guitar work is my kind of stuff, reminiscent of \\"Paperback Writer,\\" \\"Rain\\" and \\"She Said, She Said.\\"<br /><br />\\"Let There Be Love\\" - Fantastic as ballads go.  I like it's Lennon-esque feel.  It's also the only Liam/Noel duet I can recall.<br /><br />All in all, this is a very good album.  I hesitate to call it great because it's a bit hard to tell whether it will stand up over a few years.  Be Here Now sounded great in 1997 but is hard to listen to in spots these days - Noel actually says it's a horrible record.  Standing on the Shoulders of Giants' weaknesses are now more apparent than in March 2000.  This album is stripped down enough that it should not suffer for its excesses.  Don't Believe the Truth has the potential to be the third best record Oasis has ever made and it is about as good as just about any other rock album to come out in the last two or three years.other Liam-penned number.

0790742780|5.0|Review no. 145. Outstanding motion picture about an extremely frustrated man, William Foster (Michael Douglas) who's just been laid off from his job at the local defense plant. As he tries to get to his ex-wife's house to celebrate his daughter's birthday, he happens to come across some rather unpleasant experiences that one could only stumble upon in such rough neighborhoods of Los Angeles. Police officer, Prendergast (Robert Duvall) is merely one day before retirement as he puts in an above and beyond the call of duty effort to one way or another stop Foster from causing any more destruction than he already has. I've spoken with several movie fans who actually think this movie is funny. It's certainly not meant to be that way at all. Overall, an excellent drama / thriller. Most memorable scene: where Foster winds up in an army surplus store where he's confronted by this Nazi whack job that wants to befriend him as one of his own. Great acting and directing.
B0007ZEO4G|5.0|THE BAND: Ritchie Blackmore (guitars), David Coverdale (vocals), Jon Lord (keyboard/organ), Ian Paice (drums), Glen Hughes (bass). Coverdale and Hughes replace departed members Ian Gillan and Roger Glover respectively.<br /><br />COMMENTS: I saw EMI's 30th anniversary edition of \\"Burn\\" as well as Rhino's remastered and extended version of the same title... and went with this one from Rhino. With EMI's version being 2x the price of Rhino's - the decision was fairly easy. Both contain the same track listing - 13 songs - the 8 original tunes, plus one new remix (\\"Coronarias Redig\\"), 4 of the classic songs from \\"Burn\\" remixed in 2004, and an extensive 24-page booklet packed with band info and rare pictures. The remixes, like they did with the 25th anniversay edition of \\"Machine Head\\", are the same songs from \\"Burn\\", but with slightly different guitar solos, maybe a slightly different intro or ending... but for the most part the same song. Let me say that it's a treasure to here these classic songs performed slightly different. This disc is a must-have for the Deep Purple fan! After 1973's \\"Who Do We Think We Are\\" was released, and then their live double-album  classic \\"Made In Japan\\", Deep Purple was sitting on top of the hard rock world. Gillan and Blackmore were at odds over musical direction. Also, Blackmore's main issue was the fact that he wrote 80% of all the material, but the credit was split 5 ways. With all the tension, something had to give... and lead singer Gillan left. Original bassist Roger Glover departed with Gillan. Glen Hughes (ex-Trapeze) aptly replaced Glover - bringing an above average ability on bass guitar and better backing vocals. In steps \\"a young and pimply-faced\\" David Coverdale at the ripe age of 23. After listening to a muddled demo tape, Blackmore, Paice and Lord invited the unknown singer for a try out (after Paul Rodgers from Free and soon to be formed Bad Company refused)... and the rest is history.  In my opinion \\"Burn\\" was the last great album the band put out. \\"Stormbringer\\" was good for us fans, but Blackmore thought otherwise and made a quick exit soon thereafter. \\"Come Taste The Band\\" was very good, but keep in mind, guitarist Tommy Bolin is no Ritchie Blackmore. Purple's reunion in 1984 with \\"Perfect Strangers\\" had some great tunes on it, but there were some equally bad ones mixed in. The title track \\"Burn\\" is loud and pumps you up from the start, \\"Might Just Take Your Life\\", \\"Lay Down, Stay Down\\", \\"You Fool No One\\" are 4 hard rocking tunes that showcase the brass balls of the band. And, the popular bluesy \\"Mistreated\\" is one of their best slow songs - ever. John Lord is/was incredible on the piano/keyboards, Blackmore is/was a God on guitar, and the absolute backbone of the band is/was master drummer Ian Paice. Hughes and Coverdale were great replacements and they were never better than here on \\"Burn\\". The sound is 24-bit digitally remastered and sounds like it was recorded last week. Essential in any rock & roll library.great album the band put out. \\"Stormbringer\\" was good for us fans, but Blackmore thought otherwise and made a quick exit soon thereafter. \\"Come Taste The Band\\" was very good, but keep in mind, guitarist Tommy Bolin is no Ritchie Blackmore.

0446310786|5.0|I know that some people here think this is a forum to discuss their political views and whatnot instead of a BOOK REVIEW.  Let me set the record straight:  It is not.  Go find the appropriate place and do so there.  (For those who don't know what I am talking about or who are feigning ignorance and/or innocence, please read the comments posted below mine.) <br /> <br />As for the book itself, I loved it!  I read it in 10th grade as part of an assigned reading in class.  A few years later, I read it again, just for the sheer enjoyment of it.  I have not, since then, been lucky enough to get my hands on a copy, but I will one day.  I will say this, though, without giving away the plot (for those who haven't read it yet), I am a person who is hardly EVER moved to tears, yet this is the first book I've read that has made me cry!!!  There are only one or two other books that have made me do that, but that is another story for another time.  Also, the book cleared up some things for me, mainly why familial ties and pride are so important to us Southerners.  I didn't know for the longest time.  Now I do.  Thanks, Harper Lee!   <br /> <br />Overall, a good book and a MUST READ!!!
B0007GAERG|5.0|This album is Mariah Carey's thirteenth overall in sixteen years. Almost every year since 1990,Carey has put out one album. However,the GLITTER soundtrack and the two-CD GREATEST HITS compilation were released in 2001. This album is Carey's second on the Island label. The first was 2002's CHARMBRACELET. And of course,guest artists include various rap and hip-hop artists such as Jermaine Dupri and Snoop Dogg. Both artists previously collaborated with Carey for her earlier albums such as RAINBOW and CHARMBRACELET. If Carey keeps going with her singing career,she'll take home a Lifetime Achievement award just like Elton John,Billy Joel,Aerosmith,the Bee Gees and the Rolling Stones. This album is great. No fan of R&B,rap or hip-hop should be without it.
B0007Y08I8|4.0|There were scenes in this movie that were so absolutely hysterical that I had tears in my eyes from laughing so hard.  What is so funny about watching puppets curse, fornicate, and vomit?  I don't know, but it's a scream.  It's like watching a couple of 15-year-old boys under the influence of pure Id who have gotten hold of their little sister's Barbie collection, and gone hog wild.   <br /> <br />The film not only lampoons action movies, it takes no prisoners in its treatment of loud-mouthed Hollywood liberals like Susan Sarandon, Tim Robbins, Alec Baldwin, and George Clooney--all actors I enjoy watching, by the way--who present themselves as experts on world politics and in this movie become dupes for uber-Terrorist Kim Jong Il, spouting pabulum about \\"corporate America,\\" and \\"environment.\\"  It really is hilarious, and easy to see why Sean Penn fired off an angry letter to Parker and Stone.
B000062YB1|5.0|...but still a classic slayer album. This album has many classic tunes that slayer still jams out live today. Dead skin mask, War ensemble, Blood red, and Born of fire are among my favorites. If you like driving, thick sounding drums, lots and lots of chromatic scales, and screaming, this is an excelent album for you to own. You won't be dissapointed.
B000000645|5.0|`The Hangman's Beautiful Daughter' (Daughter) by The Incredible String Band (TISB) is the album which established my affection for their music. I first became aware of the act with a newspaper review of `The 5000 Spirits or The Layers of the Onion' (5000 Spirits) which compared the album favorably to `Sergeant Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band'. See my review of this album for my full assessment of this album, but rest assured I do not agree that this album is in the same league as one of the most important music albums of the 1960's.<br /><br />`The 5000 Spirits or The Layers of the Onion' and that review was strong enough for me to look out for the TISB's next album (this one) and I was appropriately rewarded when I first heard this work on vinyl about 35 years ago. For starters, it simply hangs together much better than the earlier album. `5000 Spirits' seems to be just a collection of imaginative songs, most of that are probably considered `novelty songs'. `Daughter' is tied together by several parallel themes, the most important of which is linked to the album title and consists of stories admonitions, and entertainment's for an adolescent girl. The second theme running though most of the songs is the classic ancient elements of earth, air, fire, and water.<br /><br />Many of the songs on `Daughter' still have the novelty flavor about them, but are ennobled by their role as children's entertainment. The centerpiece `entertainment' is the song I committed to memory way back then, `The Minotaur's Song', which is a classic TISB blend of myth and (Gilbert and Sullivan) parody, including references to `the earth', in keeping with the four elements theme. If it were not for the reference to Gilbert and Sullivan and the song based on microbiology (`A Very Cellular Song'), one can almost imaging these songs being written by traveling minstrels out in the hinterlands in a squire's manor house before the advent of either gas or electric light.<br /><br />In fact, one theme which seems to run through much of the TISB work is the notion of homemade entertainment, based on the beatnik / hippie culture of 1960s.<br /><br />The Incredible String Band does much that is very good in later albums, but this is the one I always think of first when I come back to listening to them about once every year. This is the album that captures their style, subjects, and themes much better than the highly praised earlier album.<br /><br />If you are roaming around recordings of obscure 1960's Scottish performers, this is the album to try if you have an interest in The Incredible String Band!e theme which seems to run through much of the TISB work is the notion of homemade entertainment, based on the beatnik / hippie culture of 1960s. <br /> <br />The Incredible String Band does much that is very good in later albums, but this is the one I always think of first when I come back to listening to them about once every year.

B000062YAZ|5.0|This is the ultimate slayer album. Fast, aggressive, and in your face satanic metal. This ain't your glamed out 80's metal crap either. This is some hard stuff. My favorites are Angle of death (of course), Necrophobic, Criminally insane, Postmortem, and Raining blood.
B0007OCG56|3.0|This is a strange story told from the point of view of a daughter writing a college application essay. <br /> <br />Tea Leoni is a rich woman who has just hired a new housekeeper who only speaks Spanish, a language Leoni cannot speak.  Her husband, Sandler, is head chef at a fine restaurant.  Both Leoni and the housekeeper have young daughters.  Tea also has a son. <br /> <br />Tea Leoni sees the housekeeper's daughter as the daughter she would love to have and sets out to make it true in action if not in fact.  This causes stresses all across the board.  Eventually Sandler shows up and meets the housekeeper.  Eventually love begins to blossom between the two but both know it can not be allowed to go anywhere. <br /> <br />In the end everyone seems to have had a fight with everyone else (not really true but it sure seems like it) and the film ends in a way most audiences will not like but will eventually convince themselves is the best that could have happened given the circumstances.  My real problem with this long long film is that it seemed very choppy.  I felt I was watching a film adaptation of a long novel and that crucial scenes had been left out.  This is apparently not the case but everyone I watched it with felt the same way.  We all agreed it was strange, choppy, erratic, and definitely NOT a comedy.  But do not be fooled by this, you will see some very good acting from most of the cast (especially the housekeeper's daughter), it is just the story that suffers and no amount of good acting can fill that in.
B0002TKFR2|5.0|Heifetz handles both the Mendelssohn and Beethoven with his extraordinary skill and grace. He is by no means cold or mechanical on this recording-- instead, he is expressive though not sappy. The Beethoven is sheer perfection--it gives me chills up my spine whenever I hear it. I have heard many versions of this concerto, but the Heifetz and Munch version is the only one that sounds exactly right. The same goes with the Mendelssohn. Once you listen to this recording, you'll wonder how you were able to even tolerate other versions of these concertos.
B000002P5W|5.0|This has to be my favorite Hendrix album.  The material is all fresh, all original, and is really all Jimi.  Unlike the material on \\"Are You Experienced\\" and \\"Electric Ladyland,\\" every song was written by Jimi Hendrix.  The stuff is also very short, and I think that that makes it much more enjoyable.  I don't care how much you praise \\"Voodoo Chile\\" for its awesome bluesy-whatever, it's still far too long for my tastes (although I do enjoy the riff at the very end). <br /> <br />Although this album was apparently rushed, it really doesn't leave the impression of having been composed or recorded in such a manner.  Many of the tunes seem to be very laid-back, and there really aren't any really rockin' tunes like a \\"Purple Haze\\" or an \\"All Along the Watchtower\\" and that's what makes it one of those albums that you can really play anytime (if you like the Experience's music that much).  I also think that that's why most people forget about \\"Axis\\" when they think of Jimi and the Experience -- there aren't any popular tunes on it, so it must have been really bad.  It's actually a very good album that has a lot to say about Hendrix and his music if you give it a chance. <br /> <br />If you consider yourself to be any kind of Hendrix fan, there's really no excuse for not owning this.  And if you've listened to a lot of Hendrix music before but really aren't sure you'll enjoy this one, buy it anyway.  I was extremely unsure myself about this one and didn't think I'd enjoy it, but it quickly became my favorite.  Take my word for it and purchase this album.
0440416027|4.0|Skellig <br />By: David Almone <br /> <br /> Skellig is a good mystery book for kid's ages 10-16. It's a 192 page book, so it's not a hard book to read. It's a mysterious book. It's mostly held at a dark house. The book is about this boy who has the creepiest imagination. The boy and his mother, father, and sister all moved into a big house. And he was really excited to move in, but then something horrible happened his sister gets really sick and he starts looking through his big dark house. He thinks he finds something. <br /> <br /> I would have to rate this book a seven out of ten. I would rate this book a seven because of the plot. It kept me reading the book because when I didn't really like it something crazy or interesting would happen. I liked this book because it's kind of crazy and because it keeps you in the book. But I think those who really like mystery and these kind of books and want to find out who or what the creature is should go out and get this book. <br />
B00005OMTT|5.0|This CD truly is a masterpiece; not only it encompasses some of the best works from Michael Cretu but its also extremely coherent. It has an extraordinary opening with two new songs whose purpose is to get you in the mood (something the Editor didn't seem to understand when he says they are not noteworthy). Starting the CD without them wouldn't have been fair to Gravity of Love (which is one of my favorites). <br />TNT for the brain, Principles of Lust fading nicely into Sadeness, Mea Culpa, Morphing through time, they are just great. <br />If you've heard a couple songs from Enigma and you liked them, you wont regret buying this CD.
B000059MEK|5.0|Yes it's me J.G. with another review on music.OK this one bottom line best daft punk album. DON'T YOU PEOPLE ARGUE WITH ME!This is the best one and you know it.A lot of people are going to say 'Homework' is the best.It actually is a great album just not the best. Yes i'm the little sissy that wrote \\"Don't rag on me\\" in the 'Homework' review, well it happened and its not gonna happen again! <br />But anyway get this one then get'Homework'. <br />                               J.G. ...    ENJOY!!!!
B00005AXEL|5.0|Trouble in Shangri-La is one of the best pieces of work Stevie Nicks has ever produced. This is a GREAT cd from beginning to end.  <br /> <br />The thing that amazes me about this cd is that it has multiple producers, yet flows perfectly. It's as though the producers all got together and said 'Let's throw in a lot of 70's Fleetwood Mac, a touch of 80s Fleetwood Mac, a bunch of 'Bella Donna' and a little 'Wild Heart' and make the perfect stevie nick's album'. <br /> <br />Sheryl Crow produces several songs and even wrote 'It's Only Love'. Although Crow recorded the song for her next album, I believe she wrote this song specifically for Stevie. The opening line of the song - 'I think I met my match again' - seems to reference Stevie's Fleetwood Mac hit 'Sara'. <br /> <br />Not since 'Bella Donna' has so many great songs been on one Nicks album. Several songs were written in the 70s and 80s, but were never released. Planets of the Universe was written and recorded during the 'Rumours' sessions - (the original recording can be heard on the 2 cd re-release of Rumours about a year ago and sounds nothing like the great version on this cd). Stevie also wrote some great new songs for the cd. <br /> <br />Although much attention is made for the many guest stars of the cd, most of my favorites are the songs sung by Stevie and her two back up singers of many years. My personal favorites are Candlebright, Sorceror, Planets of the Universe, It's Only Love, Love Changes, and Love Is.   <br /> <br />If you are a Stevie Nicks fan, definitely add this one to your collection.
B000000WCV|4.0|I love daft punk but this one isn't the best! i'm sorry to some people that think it is don't rag on me or nothing please.But face it it's the 2nd best 'Discovery' is the best there is good songs on it though! Like 'Around The World' and 'Da Funk'.If you are just starting off on daft punk get 'Discovery' and then 'Homework'.
0140277447|5.0|A nation failed to accepted its own history will not be accept by the world. <br /> <br />Got the book before the memorial day. Let's remember what happened sixty years ago.  <br /> <br />Thanks for Chang's great work. May she rest in peace.
B00006AFUR|5.0|The landscape of rock, and music in general, is pretty flooded with bands, but sometimes, a band will come out of nowhere and blow you away. 30 Seconds to Mars fits that exactly. <br /> <br />30STM is the brainchild of actor/musician Jared Leto, the band takes a very unique approach to the scene, lyrically they have alot in common with bands like Pink Floyd. That's a pretty lofty comparison, but they do it pretty effectively. <br /> <br />There are really no rough spots on the album, it is a masterpiece of prog, new-wave, metal, and industrial mixed into one. Leto's vocals are excellent and really hit high points all over the album. If you like bands with a standout frontman, check it out, Leto is amazing. <br /> <br />The album hits from many directions and keeps you entertained throughout.If you are into synth at all, check them out. The synth man from the band Deadsy provided keys for the opening track. <br /> <br />It's a great release from most popular music. It is a great band with a great debut album...if you are a fan of experimental rock, or rock in general, then you owe it to yourself to check this one out.
B00004Z4WQ|1.0|Scary Movie is one of those dreadfully unfunny comedies that just had so much potential but fell short. I mean what genre is easier or more fun to parody than the horror genre? If there had been more witty observations on scary movies than juvenile humor it might have been good. Personally I blame the Wayans, because the third wasn't as juvenile, and was you know actually funny...
B0007Z4S4C|4.0|I bought this CD upon release just after I bought tickets for his first show at Ryman Auditorium in Nashville...the show sold out in about an hour.  I was expecting more of the eclectic romp and musings of his earlier solo efforts and was pleasantly surprised to hear a powerful hybrid of Western Delta Blues with Eastern and North African influence as well.  This album really grew on me, and I really began to appreciate it and his surviving voice...I wonder if he had laryngeal surgery...when I cranked it up really loud!  I won't bore the reader with a song by song critique, but my faves were All the King's Horses, Freedom Fries, Mighty Rearranger, and Shine it All Around.  This music is clearly not just for die-hard Zep fans.
B000929AJQ|4.0|I will keep this short.  After the brilliant Fragile, which demonstrated that rock can approach jazz with its tonalities and complexities, NIN has returned to a more accessible and hit oriented formula.  The songs are more complex than Pretty Hate Machine, for example, but do not push the envelope.  I have only picked that album as an easy reference.  I like With Teeth but it certainly will not be the only album I listen to for two weeks straight. It just seems more of a top 40 oriented album than Fragile (OK, top 40 may be a bit of an exaggeration with Trent Reznor but the point is made) so I am a bit disappointed but still think it is  a great album.
B0007GAEW6|5.0|First of all, this album is extremely amazing, but only if you are open-minded about art and any form of expression.  Unfortunately, many reviewers don't understand that everyone has a different idea of what art is and consider themselves art aficionados when it comes to \\"artistic\\" music\\".   <br /> <br />When I purchased this album, I didn't know what to expect.  After experiencing the other work from these two musicians, I knew that something, actually anything, could happen.  I learned exactly what I set out to learn, that these chaps are as undpredictable as ever.  That is the whole appeal of this type of art.  It keeps you on your toes and always wondering what is next and why they have ventured in that particular direction.   <br /> <br />Buy this CD if you want something different, but don't buy it expecting the same old crap that many bands seem to reproduce from album to album.  THIS IS NOT ONE OF THOSE BANDS!!  The Mars Volta actually change from album to album.   <br /> <br />Enjoy.
B00025ETIW|5.0|I judge an album's success by a few factors.  The first, how many tracks make it to my iPod Shuffle?  With limited room, this is a key factor.  With this album, \\"Helena,\\" \\"You Know What They Do ....,\\" \\"I'm Not OK,\\" and \\"Hang 'Em High\\" all made it.  That is good. More will make it.  Second, do I find myself singing these songs as I am walking down the street?  Answer is yes.  Finally,  do they strike a visceral chord when I hear them?  Answer again is yes.  In short this is a great band that combines clever lyrics, with blistering energy, with great melodies and clever hooks and bridges.  If you like punk or heavy metal or even just rock with some nerve, then you will love this band.
B00097A5I6|3.0|Okay, have heard this baby thrice. Overall comments: definitely NOT a classic album like WTS(MG) was. Having said that there are some beauties on this cd in my opinion. As an album, this Oasis offering is (unfortunately) very Heathen Chemistryesque: somehow the songs seem to lack any cohesiveness...nonetheless, here's my song by song take...  <br /> <br />1. Turn Up the Sun  <br />Nice Travis-ish intro leads into the Oasis we know once the drums start. But this is not the sign of things to come: this song is probably the richest in instruments, most of the songs are guitar dry, much like Lyla. Some classic Oasis attitude on this one, but I don't think I'm going to be listening to this a lot in the future.  <br /> <br />2. Mucky Fingers  <br />Noel said this was his fav song on the album. I heard it first and said WTF (?). But I commend Noel for trying something different: Dylan meets Velvet underground describes this song well, which is for most part a silly 3 chord deal on the guitar with occasional clever lyrics (\\"and as you face your disease you can squeeze into the emperor's clothes\\") . This one will grow on you eventually but didnt dig this one first up. Noel does his nosy high pitched repetitions that get to me again (arrrgh!)!  <br /> <br />3. Lyla  <br />Enough said about Lyla. I didn't like it as a single and it doesnt sit too well here either. Some guitar, boys? Turn up the volume on Some Might Say and hear the sound we love! Nice song, but too sparse I think...  <br /> <br />4. Love Like a Bomb  <br />Liam doing his Little James thing. Can almost see him write these songs with 3-4 chords that he knows and then come and show this to Noel who loves it since he ain't got anything better. Scary.  <br /> <br />5. Importance of Being Idle  <br />Sweet stuff. A strong moment for Oasis and Noel's never sounded better IMO: for a while I even doubted it was him. Clean falsetto and a very nice song...fantastic, epic song and super lyrics to boot. And a nice little solo happening.  <br /> <br />6. Meaning of Soul  <br />Bad News: this song. Good news: It's 1:40 min long. So why? Skip this and forgive the Gallaghers...  <br /> <br />7. Guess God Thinks I'm Abel  <br />Fantastic. Liam's best song ever/yet I think...If he's going to have to write 5 to come up with one of these, it may be worth it. Just wish those other 4 were'nt released. Having said that, tons of filler stuff here that eventually drags the song along and makes you wanna skip it. But ripped clean to its basics, this is a nice baby.  <br /> <br />8. Part of the Queue  <br />God, this is such a wierd song. Every bit reminds you of other songs. Starts with this identical Travis riff, goes into something that reminds me of some German song I had heard...nice song and all, but gets me too suspicious (atleast right now) to appreciate it too much...I mean we all know Oasis aren't the most original band around, but still.  <br /> <br />9. Keep the Dream Alive  <br />The strongest song on this album, IMO. LOVE That bass drum intro roll and I've listened to that 10 times! And the song has soul and more honesty than anything in the album, almost on any Oasis song. Fantastic, and I will treasure this one the way I treasure Cast no shadow, half the world away, getting older, the masterplan. Fantastic, refreshing and redeeming. The Roll with it-Supersonic-Cigarrettes and Alcohol days are over.  <br /> <br />10. Bell Will Ring  <br />Yeah right. Song goes nowhere, does nothing. Reminds me of Standing on the Shoulders of Giants. Filler stuff.  <br /> <br />11. Let There Be Love  <br />I've always liked Noel's acoustic stuff that ends up as B-sides or bootleg stuff. I've always wished Liam sung smore of them and he does on this one. And then to make things better, Noel sings the bridge with all the violins going in the back, something I have never seen on an Oasis song (correct me if I'm wrong): Liam doing verse and chorus and Noel chipping in with such a long bridge (not like Acquiesce). The post bridge session is very Beatlesque, like something off Abbey Road with very Ringo-ish drumming. The song itself is rather weak, but I love the way Noel and Liam share vocals...They should do this more often....  <br /> <br />Strong Songs:  <br />Keep the Dream Alive  <br />Guess God Thinks I'm Abel  <br />Let There Be Love  <br /> <br />Weak Songs:  <br />The meaning of soul  <br />Bell will ring  <br />Love Like a bomb
B00005IC2H|5.0|I'm not going to use technical words, merely because I am no good at using them. Simply put, in my opinion this album is excellent. Sigur Ros don't cease to amaze me with every album they release. Well done chaps.
B0007GAERG|5.0|This is the first time i purchased Mariah's music since 1993. I bought it from itunes and it cost me just $9. Great bargain! But i could've been equally happy if i had ended up paying a regular $18.99 for it! This is that good folks!!!    Having said that let me also say this:Seriously, who are all those others next to her?!? This album is such a triumph that the only person who could top this is only Mariah herself!!!    I thought We Belong Together was a great song until i heard Circles which is simply an unreal song!!!  Who can do that?!?Club tunes It's Like That, Get Your Number, To The Floor are fantastic too. Not to forget gems like Say Something, Stay the Night, Fly Like a Bird. Over-all this is top-notch!    If you have the slighest interest in Mariah you should purchase this right now!!!
B0006399FS|1.0|My gosh, why are all bands sinking so low these days? <br />Theres no such thing as real music. <br /> <br />All praise \\"Coldplay\\" \\"Franz Ferdinhad\\" and  \\"The Darkness\\"
B0002YCVXI|5.0|The power of exquisite movie soundtracks is exhibited by superstar composer in this field Morricone.  Couple this with the superstar celloist Ma and one gets this magnificent effort of Yo-Yo playing some of Morricone's best scores.<br /><br />The power and majesty of Morricone's scores soar off this disc and especially Gabriel's Oboe & The Falls from The Mission as well as scores from Moses which I am unfamiliar with but will check it out.  As other reviewers have already pointed out, the Nocture from The Lady Caliph is unbelievable in its escstacy and enchantment, here heightened by Ma's passionate intonation and interpretation.  He glides and powers through this music with ease and focus and thus this collusion with the composer begats a magnficent sound.<br /><br />To be enjoyed!
B00097DX3U|1.0|Never before has a more unannoying band made such unnoying music. <br />The music is enthralling! <br />Chris Cornell has never sung such a bunch of songs with so much feeling and \\"like he cares\\" in a blue moon. <br />And this just blows rage against the machine out of the water, and soundgarden - hah move aside!
B0000640VM|5.0|Great movie! Catchy songs will make this groovy adaption of Charles Dickens' Oliver Twist worth watching! Here are my ratings on the songs: <br /> <br />Once Upon A Time in New York City: A+ <br />Almost enough to make you cry! <br /> <br />Why should I Worry?: A+ <br />Billy Joel is a riot as Dodger! <br /> <br />Streets of Gold: A+ <br />Great beat! (Note: a longer version is on the soundtrack, but I don't mind.) <br /> <br />Perfect Isn't Easy: A+ <br />I was floored when Bette Midler as Georgette sang this! She's a great singer! <br /> <br />Good Company: F <br />I don't like this song. It's too gushy and, in my humble opinion, <br />it kinda breaks the tension of the film plot. I sure wish it was deleted! <br /> <br />Buscando Guayaba: B <br />I don't get it. <br /> <br />So get this DVD! You will not be sorry!
B00097A5I6|5.0|This deserves at least 4.5 stars, so that is why I'm reviewing this.  Yep.
0743454529|2.0|I am a Jodi Picoult fan.  I have read most of her books and was enjoying this one based on a family in turmoil.  Kate, a young girl, has a rare form of leukemia and her sister, Anna, was conceived to provide a donor match.  As she grows older, Anna decides to sue her parents so that she can make her own decisions about her body and its use.<br /><br />Picoult raises some good issues.  For example, can parents make medical decisions about another sibling's donor roles? What is ethical?<br /><br />Multiple viewpoints are used in this story so that we are able to see each family member's perspective on things.<br /><br />The sisters, Kate and Anna are the real story here though.  The bond between them, the competition and loyalty, is the highlight of the book.  They are siblings through their genes but are unable to separate from each other to grow into distinct individuals until Anna tries to maintain her independence.<br /><br />The ending however was lacking.  I don't want to spoil the book, but as was pointed out to me in my bookclub, the lawyer, Campbell, would never have been driving based on his medical problem.  It was a contrived ending that completely ruined the story for me.<br /><br />I will read more Picoult books because I like her style but I was disappointed in the end with this one.
B00097DX3U|4.0|in '92 happened a tragic event in rock music,the boring untalented legions of grunge bands like nirvana took the place of great real talented singers and musicians of AOR,hard rock and real metal bands. <br />now it seems that this musical pollution is going to an end if also tom morello (ratm) and chris cornell(soundgarden) finally decided to play music and not only make some noise for 15yo nerds. <br />this record is nothing to compare to masterpieces like zeppelin,sabbath,journey,whitesnake etc...but is a million time much better than the crap of nu metal rap punk etc... <br />maybe is time of real musicians and real singers again after 13 years of the worst music ever happened on this earth!!
B00097A5I6|5.0|I am a HUGE Oasis fan, and this album is absolutely spectacular.  I love every song on the CD.  Anyone who has loved Oasis in the past will not be dissappointed!  The Importance of Being Idle and Part Of The Queue are my favorite songs.
0064407667|4.0|Have you ever had a relative that you just hate?  Have you ever had to run away from someone?  In the Bad Beging 3 orphans have to from there evil Count Olaf. <br /> The Bad Beginning is a book about 3 children who just lost their parents and there house in a fire. Violet, Klaus, and Sunny, first go and live with Mr. Poe (there parents friend and banker).  After awhile they finally go live with Count Olaf, because he is the closest relative.  Count Olaf treats the children awful, and he tries very hard to get the children's fortune, that their parents left for them.  Fourtenly the children figure out his play and go to tell Mr. Poe <br /> Mr. Poe doesn't believe them.  Finally after Mr. Poe believes them he tries to capture Count Olaf, bust just then the lights goes out.  Count Olaf gets away.  So the children have to go and live with anther realative, but they know Count Olaf is still after them. <br /> I recommend this book for anyone over the age of 5.  This book is very interesting.  This book is also very hard to put down.  <br />
B00097A5I6|5.0|Don't Believe The Truth is packed full of layered tunes which evidence Oasis' maturity. Particularly impressive are two of Liam's compositions: Guess God Thinks I'm Abel and Love Like a Bomb. Also worth noting is Noel's breezy falsetto on The Importance of Being Idle and the middle 8 bars of \\"Let There Be Love.\\" Oasis' best album since What's The Story Morning Glory. 4.5/5
B00005LAGO|5.0|Surfer Rosa must be one of the greatest alternative rock albums ever recorded.  Its abrasiveness takes a bit of getting used to, but once you're over the hurdle, it's an exhilarating album. The Pixies had everything a rock band could possibly want- their music is a thrilling adrenaline-fuelled ride- a perfect blend of melody and noise, characterised by a free-wheeling eclecticism, a much-imitated sound of lurching rythmical dynamics and, to top it all, a crazy front man with inspired lyrics.  Steve Albini's production is equally impressive- the snare drums crack and the guitars fizz (they were recorded in a toilet cubicle!)- giving the album an irresistible energy. <br />Come On Pilgrim lacks the punch of Surfer Rosa, and isn't as well recorded, but its worth having for Caribou, Ed is Dead and I've Been Tired, for its amusing lyrics (\\"I said I wanna be a singer like Lou Reed/I like Lou Reed/she said, sticking her tongue in my ear..\\") <br /> <br />It amazes me when people laud albums like White Light/White Heat, Loveless and Daydream Nation, when this album clearly wipes the floor with all of them.  It's even got a classic sleeve, with some gratuitous female nudity and a surrealism-inspired guitar head protruding from the wall.  What more do you want?   <br />
B000268QB2|4.0|This beautiful record is one of my favorite new CDs, which is odd because I'm the kind of guy who usually listens to Aesop Rock (abstract hip-hop) and Daft Punk (electronica). <br /> <br />\\"Somewhere Only We Know\\" is probably my favorite song on this record, you just listen to it and you feel good. I often find myself singing along. Great music in its purest form. <br /> <br />\\"This Is The Last Time\\" and \\"Bend and Break\\" are great tracks, with nice work on piano, drums, and vocals in both...but they both lead up to the fantastic, although rather melancholy, \\"We Might As Well Be Strangers\\". Just as good as \\"Somewhere Only We Know\\", its vocals and piano are beautiful, accompanied by a great beat.  <br /> <br />\\"Everybody's Changing\\", the next track, has a fantasic beat and piano line with some synth in the background. A cool song to jam to. \\"Your Eyes Open\\" is another good song, and \\"She Has No Time\\" is a nice mellow, chilled track. \\"Can't Stop Now\\" is a very good song, which has some outstanding piano and drums during the chorus. <br /> <br />\\"Sunshine\\" has some nice rhodes-style piano, a cool beat, and what might be the best vocal work on the album. \\"Untitled 1\\" has an awesome electronic-flavored beat with some good piano and vocal work. \\"Bedshaped\\" closes off the album with a nice climax.
B00097A5I6|5.0|I Bought This Cd Yesterday And Yes Its Very Different From Their Last Cd (Heathen Chemistry) I Think Its Better Theirs A Lot Of Great New Songs The One I Really Like The Most Is The Last Track (Let There Be Love) Liam's Voice Sound's So Amazing, But Overall The New Album Is Great I Think, If Your An Oasis Fan You Should Have This Album Already. <br /> <br />KENNY
0385486804|5.0|the copy of outside magazine sat around our firehouse for months. finally one day i picked it up and read the article about chris mccandless. that was the beginning of a love affair with me and jon krakauer.according to outside magazine, that article about chris mccandless received more mail than any other article in the history of the magazine. i knew i just had to read the book, even though this is not typical reading material for a female. <br />  once i opened the book, i could not put it down. i was fascinated. who was this kid who gave up everything to live like a nomad and wonder around the most remote parts of our country, living off the land? krakauer draws the reader in and explains why he thinks chris did what he did. while others in this review section criticize krakauer for filling this book with bits and pieces from his own experiences and some from other strange characters. my favorite was the guy who absentmindedly forgot to have the bush pilot who dropped him off in the remote outback for a few months come back to get him......need i say what happened to him? read the book and see.  <br />all in all this is a great book. very absorbing. you won't be disappointed. into thin air is another great read by krakauer. <br /> <br />
B0006IUDXA|4.0|I tend to agree with most reviewers on the MacGyver DVD. I grew up watching the show during its run on Network Television. I yearned each week for the next great adventure. But, the DVD's are lacking. Nothing is included with the episodic content. Nothing adds to the value of the series. In this day and age of special features, director's commentaries, and Easter Eggs galore, the makers of the MacGyver DVD have failed. <br /> <br />Lucky for them the show's greatness bulks their rating to 4 stars. This is still MacGyver in his earliest adventures. This is MacGyver pre-Phoenix foundation. This is still a joy to watch.
B0002OERI0|1.0|This album blatently uses its Bush-bashing to cash in. Their so called political statement is nothing more than cleverly devised (but heavy handedly carried out) marketing ploy, to cater to teen angst. Who ever said Greenday are the saviours of rock 'n' roll deserves to be shot!! Save your self a lot of pain and avoid this album (and Greenday in general) at all costs.
B00097A5I6|2.0|I've given this album three listens in the last day thinking eventually my apprehension will subside and the music will sink in.  Unfortunately that hasn't happened.  My biggest criticism of this album is that many songs repeat the same droning melody of anywhere from 2-3 chords, repeatedly just hammering away.  There is just such little musicianship in the guitars and vocals on this album that it just sounds like a lot of the same thing song after song.  There is no dramatic splendor like \\"Wonderwall\\", no soaring riffs and lyrics like \\"Live Forever\\", no blues in your bones like \\"Don't Look Back In Anger\\" or \\"Stand By Me\\", no fun to be found as in \\"She's Electric\\", no anthemic rock as in \\"All Around The World\\".  It is a straight-laced, in your face, droning rock album that -- as someone else commented -- may be okay for background music but doesn't command your full attention.  I couldn't imagine any of these songs making the cut for What's The Story (Morning Glory), perhaps one or two might have made \\"Be Here Now\\".  I really wanted this to be Oasis' return to glory, instead I found it to be a huge disappointment.
B0007Y08PQ|3.0|Don't ask me why my local store had this on the shelf, but here's a brief review. I've also been buying all the \\"Special Editions\\" of the Star Trek movies, and this one is a bit disappointing. The two biggest are: 1.) ABSOLUTELY NO AUDIO COMMENTARY! Why, Why,Why?? Frakes did First Contact why not this one? It is his film. 2.) The menu is hard to use with the colours that indicate your movement. <br /> <br />That being said, if you are collecting like I am, buy it now. If you are expecting some insight from the director, skip it. Now the positives: 1.) Disk 2s extras have Deleted Scenes that will make you wish they put them back in the film for this DVD. 2.) Oluda's text commentary is always nice and sometimes funny. 3.)

B000002UA9|5.0|This is The Beatles' first album, and shows what the prior four years of gigging can do for a band with an encyclopedic knowledge of American pop and rock n' roll.  <br />  But this is not just any band-- this is the newest version, with the final piece of the miraculous puzzle in place: I mean Ringo Starr, of course, who was the best drummer in Liverpool at the time. <br />  He was the one primarily responsible for putting the \\"beat\\" in The Beatles, and having him at last made The Beatles ready for the big time. As it was, his swinging and driving drumming, those funky tom tom rolls, and that splashy cymbal work made the band's early music BREATHE with energy, character, excitement. <br />  George Martin basically tried to record the club act as honestly as possible, but even then Martin was working magic in terms of editing-- George's solo on \\"I Saw Her Standing There\\" is a patch job of several different takes.  <br />  And on this opening number we already hear something new and different: John's modal harmony under Paul's melody-- something Everly-esque but different and darker. This kind of intertwined line shows up throughout their career, most notably in \\"If I Fell\\" and \\"Hey Jude\\". We also hear a tight band with each member propelling the other along, Paul's staccato bass synching up with Ringo's propulsive drumming, and John playing rhythm guitar in the upper register like a whirligig trying to lift the song off the ground. <br />  On \\"Misery\\" we are introduced to the primal/sexual rock howl of John, \\"hampered\\" by a nasty head cold but carrying on with cough lozenges and cigarettes. This time Paul harmonizes above John in a more conventional manner, and we hear how the timbres of John and Paul's voices mesh together so well. On the fadeout the falsetto \\"la-la\\"s give us that Lennon humor. <br />  \\"Anna\\" shows that the band were real students of American music, always looking for obscure B-sides to exploit and show how they have mastered and made their own such material. This song is a showcase for John. His voice is one of the great instruments of rock n' roll as well as rock n' soul, and he is at this point a far more expressive, sexy, and sincere singer than Paul. <br />  \\"Chains\\" is another cover that shows how nicely the three singers can harmonize at this early stage, and George handles the lead vocal with a kind of one-off casualness that is endearing. Imagine having John and Paul as your backing vocals! <br />  \\"Boys\\" is a great rocker and features a fun vocal by Ringo with backing vocals by John and Paul, whose joyousness is infectious. <br />  \\"Ask Me Why\\" is a fun little song, with tight three-part harmony and a campy John extending his \\"why\\", \\"you\\", and \\"true\\" with playful \\"woo-woo-woo\\"s.  <br />  \\"Please Please Me\\" was their first hit single and was actually recorded a few months earlier. The song's call and response climb-up is erotic and infectious, Paul's bass playing is bouncy and chugging all at once, Ringo's drumming is swinging, and John's voice swoops and soars on the refrain around the other vocals in such a way that it sounds like more than two voices. David Crosby must have picked up some tips from Lennon on this song when he formed The Byrds. <br />  \\"Love Me Do\\" is lovely and simple yet has a deceptively complex harmony. I feel it shows that John and Paul were mates and really cared for each other, and its echoes can be heard all the way to \\"Two of Us\\" on their final album, \\"Let It Be\\". <br />  \\"P.S. I Love You\\" is a nice solo vocal showcase for Paul, and is Elvis-like in concept but is all Paul in terms of sweetness and romance. This is the kind of innocent and non-threatening element that made teeny-boppers develop mad crushes. <br />  \\"Baby It's You\\" is another cover song that exceeds the original version by The Shirelles. It exceeds because of John's vocal once again, at turns intimate and passionate. Paul and George do a great job backing him. <br />  \\"Do You Want to Know A Secret?\\" is another song by Lennon/McCartney written for George, and George makes no effort to hide his Liverpudlian accent on words such as \\"well\\" and \\"tell,\\" and the result is a performance of great charm. It's to his credit that George avoids sounding saccharine and cloying all at once with such a teeny-bopperish tune. Imagine if this song were sung by Peter Noone of Herman's Hermits. Yikes! <br />  \\"A Taste of Honey\\" is probably the only \\"mistake\\" on this album. Why include an American show tune? I find it implausible that John, George or Ringo would have volunteered this song. That said, John does a nice job once again harmonizing underneath Paul, keeping the song a safe distance from cutesy. \\"Honey\\" indeed. <br />  \\"There's A Place\\" is a truly excellent song about youthful confusion and angst around an infatuation that conveys much lyrically in very few words. Yet somehow a certain \\"old-soul\\" aspect adds maturity and depth to the song. The passion and understanding that John and Paul bring to the words is palpable, and adding George in on the repeated last line is a bonus. Greatness, and it could very well have served as a fitting end to this album but for... <br />  \\"Twist and Shout\\" is a perfect coda to the album, a perfect bookend to \\"Saw Her Standing There\\", and a perfect first take which propels the whole album into the stratosphere. As with \\"Baby It's You\\" it supercedes the original in its directness and power. Ringo locks in to the perfect \\"twist\\" tempo. Everyone cherishes this song and it establishes John's place as one of rock's greatest singers. Listen for the \\"cluck\\" that Paul must have added at the very end, a little touch that echoes down and expands out to his \\"Her Majesty\\" on Abbey Road. <br />  People who claim that this first album is not as great as their later work miss the point entirely-- this is not an \\"album\\" so much as England's best LIVE rock 'n roll band (at the time) captured in all their glory on tape. They did not become a STUDIO band until quite a while later.
B00097A5I6|1.0|Is modern-day rock music so bad that we give this sub-par effort five stars?  Answer me one question...where are the melodies?  Each song meanders through an aural wasteland just to end on a sour note.  This album continues the downward spiral of Heathen Chemistry and will be the undoing of the band.  They should have stopped while on top with their excellent overlooked album, \\"Standing on the Shoulders of Giants\\".  I am glad I only paid $9.95, because I might as well have just thrown my money away.  A huge disappointment!
B00097DX3U|1.0|I was a HUGE fan of the first album and a big fan of Chris and Tom overall and without a second thought rushed to purchase their second album.  I listened to it straight threw without stopping and I've got to say it sucks as bad as the White Stripes and is just as pointless.  The sound doesn't even slightly resemble that of the previous album.  Hits like \\"show me how to live\\", \\"like a stone\\", and \\"shadow on the sun\\" had soul in them.  Almost like Chris and gang were pouring their very souls out in each and every song.  This new album has no soul.  I thought it might just be one of those albums you just have to listen to awhile to like it, but believe me that is not the case.  Fortunately I also purchased the new Seether cd and it is freakin awesome and would definately recommend. Hope this helps
B0007TKNL0|3.0|Everyone(at least from those I heard) said this movie was sooooo amazing and that I HAVE to go see it. So I said, sure and rented this movie along with Lemony Snicket.  <br /> <br />Well, I have to say that I was VERY disappointed. Usually when I finish watching a movie, I either instantly LOVE it or instantly Hate it, especially those movies which are not just for entertainment purposes. So after watching Phantom, I'll have to say I didn't like it. I thought about why I didn't like it all day and finally I'm set to writing this review. <br /> <br />The Plot: let's see...beautiful but dumb and simple female main character; love at first sight with no development what-so-ever; and no matter how much they try to stress the whole comparison between the inwardness of human beings to the outwardness of human beings, they still come back to \\"judge a book by its cover please\\". That's how I felt about the plot, so incredibly cliche with almost no new ideas at all. The whole love triangle is pretty silly. I mean, the phantom has endured mistreatment for his whole entire life because of his face, he's shocked about Christine not falling for him??? So yeah, ya'll gonna say, well he has rage within him. But that just proves how cliche the story is. <br /> <br />So okay, let's not talk about the plot anymore, since it is written in eariler time, people are stupid and close-minded in eariler time. let's just talk about the movie itself. Well, I think I would like the movie much better if it weren't a musical. The musical of the movie is just soooo incredibly awkward. I think it's because phantom is like a mystery, but singing is to reveal, and since they don't want to reveal too much, the singing is just repeats and repeats. The conversation in singing is awkward too, I mean, the phantom was swearing while still singing like when he sing \\"damn you! damn you!\\" geez, awkward! <br />The music itself was provocative, but it's been ruined by cheesy lyrics. if you are familiar with Lemony Snicket, you know that it's a very cheesy movie. But alot of the lines in Lemony Snicket matches Phantom with its tone. such as in Lemony Snicket: Children, I am your beloved Count Olaf; you then look at phantom of the opera: Christine, I am your Angel of Music, sound familiar? that's right, they both have the \\"ta da\\" chessiness.  <br />The acting was mediocre. The character developments in Phantom have almost NO transition at all. I mean, after all the time with phantom, Christine NOW feels scared??? After all the time with phantom Christine suddenly falls for another man and that's that??? Christine kisses the phantom and just like that the phantom's evilness dissolves???? The acting wasn't bad, Emmy Rosumbum did pretty good as a new actress. But really, most of the goodies in the acting is just that they sing well. So yeah, Emmy can definitely sing. But if you just watch a movie to watch singing, I would rather buy CDs or download music.  <br /> <br />Overall, I really didn't like the movie, it's really rather boring. I heard the book was so much better that it makes more sense-that is, the motive of phantom's evilness makes more sense. so maybe I'll take a shot at that, but the movie really could use improvement.

6305546789|5.0|Ah the classic amongst classics, the first glimpse at the now iconic killer Michael Myers. The film that spawned so many sequels for us to view more slaying at the hands of Mr. Myers. And out of the 4 big names Freddy, Jason, Pinhead, & Myers {not counting Candyman, Leatherface, & Djinn} he is one of 2 that has yet to visit space. This is one of the timeless classic s that everyone knows and has seen. Written by producer Debra Hill {R.I.P.}, and director John Carpenter this has went down as one of the highest grossing horror films of all time.<br /><br />The film it's self is done masterfully by cinematographer Dean Candy, each shot ads to the suspense and scare factor. This is also the film that launched Jamie Lee Curtis's career, and I for one think she did an excellent job on this film, she also appeared in 3 more Halloween sequels. Also Donald Pleasence gives a masterful performance in the roll of Dr. Sam Loomis. But what most people like about this film is the score from Carpenter, namely the films theme song. Easily one of the best and most memorable scores in any film in and out of the horror genre. Then of course is the man himself Michael Myers, the original boogieman. This young serial killer is one of the greatest cinematic characters of all time. The way he keeps coming for more, and won't stop until he makes his kill. His eerie walk which proves Jason ain't the only one who can take his time with a kill. And of course the white mask, what's a slasher without one.<br /><br />The story follows Jamie Lee's character from school to babysitting the same night, and what she goes threw, after Michael escapes the asylum. As her fellow teens are chop'd up across the street she sits calmly until he comes for her. From there it is an on going struggle for life for her and the kids. Until Loomis rushes in to save the day and blast Michael threw the window right after we see his face, but once they look down he is no longer there and is on the hunt again. What a great way to end the movie.<br />All of these things make up one of  the greatest films ever made. I recommend it to everybody.d the movie.  All of these things make up one of  the greatest films ever made. I recommend it to everybody.
B00097A5I6|5.0|This is a great album!  The American music fanbase should really look into this record and recognize that Oasis can produce great music with the best of them.  Songs like The Importance of Being Idol, Part of the Queue and Let There Be Love truly display the songwritting prowess of Noel Gallagher, while Liam contributes just as well with The Meaning of Soul and Guess God Thinks I'm Abel.   <br /> <br />The best thing about this album though is that it truly showcases some great songs and fills the rock and roll void in American mainstream music.  Oasis are the most successful band of the past decade with 766 weeks on the UK charts as acknowledged by the Guiness book of world records.  It's a shame that the American market has somewhat turned a cold shoulder to oasis, but this album signifies that they can compete with any group or artist on the billboard charts.
B0009A40ES|5.0|This film was marketed completely wrong. Watch any of the trailers, and they make it out to be another one of those slasher movies. But it's so much more. It keeps the essence, and wit, and sarcasm of the book, while adding a level of elegance and sophistication that was completely unexpected. Add the absolutely flawless (not a term I would ever use lightly) performance of Christian Bale, and you have a near perfect picture. <br />  <br />Sure, it's different from the book, and cuts a lot of great stuff out. But when you watch a movie, you have to realize that it's a form of art and entertainment all it's own. You need to disconnect the book and the film, the two separate art forms, and enjoy it for what it is: Brilliant.

B00003CWTI|4.0|Director:  P.T. Anderson <br />Cast:  Jeremy Blackman, Tom Cruise, Phillip Baker Hall, Philip Seymour Hoffman, William H. Macy, Julianne Moore, John C. Reilly, Jason Robards Jr., Melora Walters. <br />Running Time:  188 minutes. <br />Rated R for strong language, drug use, simulated sex, and brief violence. <br /> <br />An incredible spectacle of a film, opening with the notion that there are no coincidences and that events transpire not by chance, but for a purpose and closes after over three hours with a brilliant underlying message paved by symbolism.  Unfortunately for P.T. Anderson's epic one-day dissertation into the lives of a dozen individuals living in the Fernando Valley, \\"Magnolia\\" is just too long and not quite enthralling or beguiling enough to sustain absolute interest.  Tom Cruise (who won the 1999 Golden Globe Award for his supporting performance and got snubbed of an Oscar) steals the show as male-chauvinist eccentric celebrity Frank T.J. Mackey, who promotes his theories about how to acquire sex from beautiful women. <br /> <br />Rich TV tycoon Earl Partridge (Jason Robards Jr.) lies on his deathbed with his estranged, drugged up wife (in a brilliant role by Julianne Moore) and sincere male nurse (Philip Seymour Hoffman) by his side.  Desperately wanting to get in touch with his long lost son (who just so happens to be Mackey), Partridge awaits his demise with despair and lament.  Phillip Baker Hall stars as the popular What Do Kids Know? game-show host Jimmy Gator, who is desperately in search of reconciliation with his druggie daughter Claudia Gator (played beautifully by Melora Walters) due to his sudden diagnosis of cancer.  John C. Reilly is exceptional as the soft, yet stern police officer who wants nothing more than to find someone to grow old with and stumbles upon the misguided Claudia along his daily cop route.  As Gator attempts to continue the game-show despite his condition, the audience learns of two outrageously intelligent child products:  Stanley (Blackman) and Donnie Smith (William H. Macy in a consistently solid performance).  Stanley is the heir-apparent to whiz kid Donnie Smith, who is now a superstar afterthought, left behind by his parents and his boss. <br /> <br />Director P.T. Anderson manages to juggle all of these characters very well throughout the film, intertwining the plot points with ease and sincerity.  Along with spectacular performances from Cruise, Moore, and Reilly, \\"Magnolia\\" possesses two incredibly memorable moments:  1) the unison sing-along to Aimee Mann's \\"Wise Up\\" is superbly hilarious and melancholy all-in-one, sending reverberates of spine-tingles of hope and gloom in harmony and 2) the most unforgettable scene of precipitation in cinema history (it makes The Birds look like child's play).  A genuine effort to show the desolation that engulfs when expectations are not met and mistakes are made, \\"Magnolia cultivates into a film that glorifies the courage, calamity, and love that transpires throughout life.  While certainly not perfect, this film is unique and complex enough to hold its own, but ultimately does not possess enough unified direction and cohesion to keep the restless viewer involved.  A great idea, a grand ensemble cast, and an amazing musical contribution from Aimee Mann; however, only adequate execution.  A very good film, just no \\"American Beauty\\". <br />
B00006D295|5.0|I remember when I saw this movie. It was on TV around 5 in the morning and me and my friend Ashley randomly found it and we watched it we could stop laughing. But then it was on VH1 then I saw it at the video store and rented it. It was a bit dirty but very good...<br /><br />Its mostly about a guy Frank(Tim Currey) who made a man name Rocky, and Brad and Janet had car trobule and came across his place. Little do they know there from outer space.  Many things happen its a must see movie. Its very random and dirty at the same time.<br /><br />When they had a show of it here I was like YES I HAVE TO GO, but I never did get to cause I had to get up early in the morning so I couldnt go but I would of loved to go to it...the music is very good also...Its a must see. Just dont show your kids, they may have nightmares.
0767817664|4.0|Director:  Tom Holland <br />Cast:  William Ragsdale, Chris Sarandon, Roddy McDowall, Amanda Bearse, Stephen Geoffreys. <br />Running Time:  105 minutes. <br />Rated R for vampire violence, gore, nudity, and some language. <br /> <br />Rivals \\"The Howling\\" as the quintessential vampire film of the past quarter-decade, \\"Fright Night\\" excels even more in the humor department.  William Ragsdale plays Charley Brewster (perhaps the best, cheesy high-schooler name ever), a regular teenager who finds himself emotionally distraught and disturbed in adolescence, but for much different reasons than any of his classmates.  Charley is convinced that his new neighbor Jerry Dandridge (Chris Sarandon) is a blood-sucking, bat-winged vampire and he will stop at nothing to get his friends and family to believe him.   <br /> <br />As Charley and his girlfriend (played by Amanda Bearse) realize that his initial perceived nightmare is true, they enlist the help of former television vampire hunter has-been Peter Vincent (in a wonderfully funny performance from the great Roddy McDowall) to bring the vampire-next-door to light.  Director Tom Holland uses a great, clever script to near perfection, mixing the elements of terror and tongue-in-cheek humor to the fullest, making \\"Fright Night\\" one of the most enjoyable and entertaining horror films of the middle decade.  Ragsdale is innocently exceptional with his performance and Sarandon is perfect as the seducing, scheming vamp.  Very good special effects and some great one-liners.  Can be enjoyed to all movie-goers, not just buffs of the horror genre.  A true campy, cult landmark. <br />

B0006SSOHC|3.0|Director:  James Wan <br />Cast:  Cary Elwes, Leigh Whannell, Danny Glover, Ken Leung,  Dina Meyer, Makenzie Vega, Monica Potter, Michael Emerson. <br />Running Time:  100 minutes. <br />Rated R for violence, lots of gore, and language. <br /> <br />\\"Saw\\" is obviously a direct pseudo-\\"Seven\\", attempting to create a new kind of psychopathic serial killer and for the most part it succeeds-but eventually falls apart slightly at the seams.  The overall premise is very clever:  A young man (played by Whannell, who also wrote the film) and an established physician (a much heavier, less charismatic Cary Elwes than in previous works) wake up in a disgusting, polluted bathroom and have no recollection of how and why they wound up there.  They are chained to the walls and accompanied by only one guest-a dead man with his head blown off.  As the doctor and his youthful companion piece the puzzle together, they realize that they are being tormented by the infamous \\"Jigsaw\\" killer, a maniac who juxtaposes his victims within scenarios in which they have to choice between their own lives or the deaths of others.  The identity of the killer is unknown, but as the truth from both of the captured men seeps through, the film picks up momentum and unfolds to a rather incomplete, far-from-stanch climax. <br /> <br />Danny Glover stars as the aging detective who was originally assigned to the \\"Jigsaw\\" case, but was unable to completely close the case.  Due to an increasingly devote fascination with the killer, the detective attempts to stop the evil murderer once and for all.  \\"Saw\\" does possess some pizzazz and intelligence, using Elwes and Co. as players in a strange and macabre game of chess; however, the film is too disjointed and acted with such mediocrity that it cannot be taken too seriously.  The novice director Wan uses some excellent, hip cinematography to liven up the film and create some tense atmosphere, but \\"Saw\\" is never incredibly scary, but does keep you guessing untilthe very last frame.  Disappointing performances from Elwes and Glover.  A nice attempt for modern horror film standards, but films such as \\"Seven\\" and \\"Silence of the Lambs\\" did it much, much better. <br />

B000099T2L|2.0|I always thought of Beyonce as a talentless, doe eyed tool with a knack for riding the trends to death but then I saw her sing the national anthem during the infamous Super Bowl, a.k.a \\"the Janet Jackson and Justin Timberlake\\" show.  Seeing her rendition gave me a brand new respect for Beyonce Knowles and all the hard work and training she puts into her voice.<br /><br />Bolstered by my newfound respect for her as an artist I bought this CD hoping to find some hidden gem.  Here was an opportunity to reveal herself as a force to be reckoned with musically and vocally and she missed it.  Just more of the same trend pandering.  It's really not her fault though.  I blame the spin doctors and music producers that market her career and belittle her talent.<br /><br />For people who like Beyonce exactly like they like her then this CD will be a great addition to your collection.  But if you are looking for another side of Beyonce other than a gyrating female cliche in every rap video ever made, save your dough.
B000024IFB|4.0|I have to GOLD edition of this 2xCD album and it rocks. The first CD is imbued with his past works that sound just as fresh today as when they were first released. Need I say more? The second CD gives us an insight of what is present state was like back then in '95. The album is good on a whole. But onyl a handful of tracks are worth having a rewind through. Some of the songs of this album are somewhat sorrowful but beautiful in their own sense of style. But this album is unique in a sense that, until today many artists cannot campare to even anything they've done, to him. He has already made his mark on the world. So please do not forget him. Just listen to this album. Because many of songs give a transparent view of his life. They are very inspirational. To date he is still \\"King Of Pop!\\". Keep FIGHTING MJ your fans still do!!!!!

B00097DX3U|5.0|Audioslave's new album Out of Exile is the second album from one of the best supergroups to come from memory.  <br />The band, which some dubbed Rage Garden or Sound Against the Machine, consists of ex-Rage Against the Machine's musicians(guitarist Tom Morello(the best guitar hero out today), drummer Brad Wilk and bass player Tim Commerford) and ex-Soundgarden frontman Chris Cornell succeeded with a superb debut album which stands now at 2 million plus sold in America and waited almost three years for its sophomore effort. Is Out of Exile as good as debut or did they lose their edge, read on and find out.  <br />We kick off with the great rocker Your Time Has Come which is fast and fun. This song just kicks serious ass. The title cut follows and is a great rocker with guitar heroics from Morello and an inspired Cornell vocal. Next is the album's first single Be Yourself which some say is like Like a Stone on the 2002 self-titled debut. It is a slower and melodic song and is a rock radio hit already with tons of airplay. Doesn't Remind Me is next and is another ballad-ish type of number but a great song. It has another superb Morello guitar solo. Drown Me Slowly follows and is back to Rock City once again. The Bulls on Parade type scratching solo Morello did is BACK! This song is just amazing and had it cranked in the car when driving on long drives. Heaven's Dead follows and is a slow smouldering rocker which sounds radio friendly but a good song nevertheless.  <br />The Worm follows and is very dark with a killer riff. This fast rocker is a must hear. The powerful but superb Man Or Animal is next. The guitar riff is relaxed but rocks like a sledgehammer. The solo is very crazy and very Rage like, making this song complete. The beautiful Yesterday to Tomorrow was influenced by Cornell's new marriage to his wife in this song. It is a nice number. The song Dandelion is next and is not a remake of the 1967 Rolling Stones number but is a ballad Chris Cornell wrote for his daughter. This song is medium tempo and is great and uplifting. The rocker #1 Zero starts off slow as Cornell sings about a stalker and transforms into a great rocker for the ages. The Curse ends the album and this mid-tempo rocker ends the album in a heavy way.  <br />Out of Exile is a great album and if you liked the first album, pick this up. In fact, Out of Exile is poised to be Audioslave's first US #1 album as of this writing. Congrats guys!  <br />RECOMMENDED!

0312263120|1.0|If you enjoy reading romance novels, think it might be fun to read a thriller with a very current-sounding plot, and don't intend to try to understand the science, you will probably thoroughly enjoy Digital Fortress.<br /><br />If you are reading this book because you are interested in the subject matter, and especially if you already have some knowledge of the subject matter, you are likely to be disappointed by the character and plot issues mentioned in other reviews of this book.
B0002858YS|5.0|I always used to find myself caught up in the pandimonium that every teenage girl faces-finding a band that sucks crap, but has a hott lead singer. Luckily this wasn't the case(so i got the best of both sides). Having only heard three killers songs before I purchased the album I had a brief idea of what I anticipated this album to sound like. Upbeat...like disco dance music. I must admit that after listening to the CD one time through I didnt really enjoy it. But soon enough it caught on to me, and I find myself singing \\"Change your mind\\" every morning in the shower. IT DID take a while to get used to the technique...which isn't that similar to any band I have really gotten into. But it was a great purchase, and I don't regret it.  <br /> <br />Though I dont really like the coverage and stuff they are getting...I loathe channels like MTV etc. It still isn't about the coverage. It really IS about the music. So I suggest to REALLY check this out if you are looking for something decent to listen to.  <br /> <br />I dub thee one of my favorite albums.  <br /> <br />-Raj Narasimhan

0441172717|5.0|I love this book. Reading it now years after first reading it, now in my 40s with a little more wisdom and maturity, it's even richer and more rewarding than ever before.  <br /> <br />My problem is with the incredibly sloppy text -- riddled with noticeable typos, funky kerning effects, and paste-up errors. Nor have these been fixed since I bought the paperback in the late 80s! The current edition, the \\"20th Anniversary\\" edition...the only thing different is the cover! Nobody took one look inside the text at all!  <br /> <br />With the advent of computers, it's now even easier to avoid these ridiculous errors, to get the text clean and keep it that way. Perhaps the publishers don't like thinking machines anymore than the Imperium. Fine -- then what about sonny boy? For the luva pete: Brian, bubby...the LEAST you can do take a look back through your father's pages with a red pencil! <br /> <br />I swear, if it were THIS book, and my OWN father, I wouldn't let one more day go by until I'd fixed the text. It's a bloody disgrace.
0385510454|4.0|It used to be that I really looked forward to a new Grisham novel.  Action-packed legal thriller, life and death situations, etc.  But then after a few books, the writing seemed to get somewhat uneven and I didn't quite know what I'd get each time I started a new one.  John Grisham's latest, The Broker, ended up being one of his better ones of late.  I really enjoyed it.<br /><br />Joel Backman, aka The Broker, was a high-powered player in the Washington scene until he took the fall for a espionage and conspiracy charge involving spy satellites and software that the U. S. didn't know existed.  Six years into a 20 year sentence, he's offered a full pardon and whisked off to Italy to start a new life off the beaten path.  But all is not as it appears.  In reality, the CIA has set up the pardons so that they can notify four other governments who are involved in the satellite situation.  Based on who goes after Backman and kills him, they'll be able to tell who the satellites belong to.  The story revolves around Backman's adjustment to learning the language and culture of the country, and then his attempts to stay alive and escape those who want him dead.<br /><br />As mentioned in the open, I found this to be one of his better efforts.  The story was interesting, and there was enough mystery involved so as to keep you guessing as to exactly what was going to happen next.  It was also fascinating to see how someone can go from a life of power and money clear down to prison and then work on acquiring street smarts in order to just stay alive.  I felt the ending left quite a bit up in the air and somewhat unresolved, but not so much that it soured the entire story for me.  Basically, it was an entertaining read that contained some enjoyable hours of escape.
0064471837|5.0|Out of all the recent dark fantasy books released, this series is probably the best. It is darkish, but not emo trouble-maker dark. It is just dark fantasy. Seriously, they should just make a new category of books called \\"emo,\\" so all the attention seeking preteens can spend their time there, and my life would not be wasted by books like Tithe.<br /><br />the end.
B000002JSP|3.0|Be forewarned: this is the worst album in Zeppelin's discography, not counting the posthumously released Coda.  Whether from exhaustion, addiction, boredom, Plant's having lost his son, Zeppelin didn't put the old fire they once had into this album. The cards seemed to be stacked against them.<br /><br />Their previous and excellent album Presence was released 3+ years before so there was a big buzz about In Through The Out Door.  The marketing teams when nuts with 5? different covers being released all hidden by a brown paper wrapper so you didn't know which cover you were buying.  Unfortunately as creative as the packaging was, In Through the Out Door wasn't worth the wait.  Zeppelin had radically changed their sound away from rock to a more experimental, pop and keyboard driven sort of music.  What happened to the guitar you ask?  Well... Page rarely showed up to the studio sessions on time (Bonzo too would show up late) much to the annoyance of John Paul Jones.  Jonesy said what the hell, we're paying for it, might as well record some tracks.  So he, and Robert Plant took over much of the writing responsibilities.  Which explains the preponderance of keyboards on this album and Page's lack of rhythm playing on some of the tunes.  But that doesn't necessarily mean that the album stinks, it doesn't.  There's actually some good pop and somewhat experimental music on this album, just don't expect the firey and guitar driven Led Zeppelin of the past 'cause it's not here, In The Evening notwithstanding.  Also I have to say that Robert Plant puts in some of the weakest vocals of his career ocasionaly sounding whiny and out of tune on some of the material. The band don't sound focused yet still manage to make a few worthwhile tunes.<br /><br />I like the fact they tried something different, but because of Page's lack of interest/contribution, ITTOD comes off as a half-hearted work.  It's too keyboard driven for my tastes, and so Zeppelin ended with a wimper and not a bang.  Little did they know that this was to be their last album as Bonzo died soon after it's release with a typical alcohol related rock star death, ie death by vomit.they know that this was to be their last album as Bonzo died soon after it's release with a typical alcohol related rock star death, ie death by vomit.
B0007QJ1MK|5.0|Queens of the Stone Age have been a favorite band of mine for a long, long time and this album solidifies that position.  Every album that they produce is better than the last.  When I first heard \\"Songs for the Deaf\\" I thought that QOTSA could get no better and when I heard the news that Nick had left and/or been booted from the band I feared that something would be missing.  My fears were sated with the arrival of \\"Lullabies to Paralyze\\".  With this album Josh Homme really stretches his creative limbs.  He harvests the best aspects of QOTSA and mixes in the best parts of his other projects (Eagles of Death Metal and the Desert Sessions).   <br /> <br />Every song has it's own \\"voice\\".  It feels like the songs were crafted and not mass-produced, which is something I notice happening with a few rock bands lately and I welcome it.  QOTSA used to be my favorite band that no one knew, but now others have found out just how good they are.  If you don't know, I'm here to let you know: Queens of the Stone Age's \\"Lullabies to Paralyze\\" is the best album of 2005 and you should give it a shot. <br /> <br />P.S.  Josh Homme has a guest spot on the new Foo Fighters album, that should be great.
B0007XT87G|5.0|I can't stop listening to this cd. I recommend buying it. I payed $15 for Deadwing at the concert, I wish i had bought it at amazon. I had known about PT for about a year & i saw they were coming to Illinois, well I saw Porcupine Tree live at the Park West on May 28th in Chicago & it was really cool to say the least. At times i am reminded of other progrock bands. I love that they have mixed heavy modern riffs with beautiful clean acoustic melodies within the same song. I'm not a reviewer, really just a fan & musician. I have listened to this cd 3 or 4 times everyday since the concert & loved every minute. I recently purchased In Absentia & Signify & am looking forward to giving them a listen. Even if you aren't a progrock fan you'll like this band.
6305171769|4.0|We have enjoyed the first six installments to the most popular film in horror history: HALLOWEEN. Now, it is time that we watch HALLOWEEN: H20-TWENTY YEARS LATER, the seventh installment to this terrifying series. <br /> <br />    It is now October 29, 1998, twenty years since the events of the Haddonfield's nightmare. In Langen, Illinois, NURSE MARION CHAMBERS-WINNINGTON (again played by Nancy Stephens), who had accompanied the late Dr. Loomis in the first two films, is residing happily. She comes home from work to find that her house was just broken into. She walks next door and runs into her 15-year-old neighbor, JIMMY HOWELL (played by Joseph Gordon-Levitt), and his friend, TONY ALLEGRE (played by Brandon Williams). He has her stay at his house, while he calls the police. But Jimmy has no patience in waiting for the police to show up. He enters Marion's house and decides to look around, making sure everything is in order and that whoever had broken in is now gone. While on the search, Jimmy steals two beers. <br /> <br />     He exits the house and claims that everything is A-OKAY. Jimmy and Tony head over to Jimmy's house, as Marion enters hers. The lights are not working, forcing Marion to get a flashlight. With the flashlight in hand, she enters her office, in which Jimmy said was ransacked like you wouldn't believe. There is a file folder on Marion's desk that reads LAURIE STRODE. She opens the folder and sees that the file on Laurie is gone. That is when MICHAEL MYERS (played by Chris Durand) appears behind her. She runs next door to find Jimmy and Tony dead. Michael appears in the house and begins chasing Marion all over. That is when the cops arrive. She tries beating Michael with a poker, but that doesn't work, for he slashes Marion's throat. <br /> <br />     Waking up from a nightmare is...LAURIE STRODE (again played by Jamie Lee Curtis). Laurie had faked her death and had gone into hiding, with a new identity and a new name: KERI TATE. Lives with herson JOHN (played by Josh Hartnett). The next morning, HALLOWEEN, where Laurie and John reside in Summer Glen, CA, with John attending a HILCREST ACADEMY PRIVATE SCHOOL, with Laurie as the headmistress, they discuss John wanting to go on the school camping trip, but Laurie does not want him to go. <br /> <br />    John meets up with his friend, CHARLIE DEVERAUX (played by Adam Hann-Byrd), Charlie's girlfriend SARAH WAINTHROPE (played by Jodi Lynn O'Keefe), and John's girlfriend, MOLLY CARTWELL (played by Michelle Williams). Charlie and Sarah are refusing to go the camping trip, while Molly and John are trying to go, but they all decide to stay behind and have a Halloween party. <br /> <br />     Laurie heads over to her office with WILL BRENNAN (played by Adam Arkin), the school's counselor, and Laurie's lover. They pass Laurie's secretary, NORMA WATSON (played by Janet Leigh, Jamie Lee's mother) and head into Laurie's office, where they confirm their lunch at 1:00. <br /> <br />    Laurie and Will have their lunch, where we see that Laurie has become an alcoholic. Everything she has tried to rid herself of the memories does not work, except for drinking. As she leaves to get back to the school, she runs into John and Charlie. She yells at John, forcing him to yell back, in saying that her not handling the 20-year old memories is driving him insane. They head back to the school, where Laurie, feeling some sympathy, let's RONNIE JONES (played by LL Cool J), the school gatekeeper, off the hook for letting the guys loose. <br /> <br />    As Molly and John talk, Laurie gives John the permission to go on the trip, but John throws away the permission slip and goes on with his friends plan to have their Halloween party. <br /> <br />    Laurie is closing up for the night and heading home, where she again sees another apparition of Michael. She continues to erase the image, but he just won't disappear until Will surprises her. He asks to drop by for the evening, wanting tokeep Laurie company for the night. <br /> <br />    John, Molly, Sarah, and Charlie arrive at the school for their party. Charlie goes off to find a corkscrew. Sarah goes off to find him and see what is taking so long. They talk briefly as Charlie goes upstairs and meets Michael. Sarah finds Charlie's dead body and runs away from Michael, but he catches her and kills her. John and Molly find their friends dead bodies and they run from Michael.  <br /> <br />    Laurie, Will, and Ronnie are checking out the school, when Will and Laurie hear Molly and John screaming for someone to let them in. Will sees someone walking up the stairs. Thinking its Michael, he shoots at him, but it turns out to be Ronnie. At that moment, Michael appears and kills Will. Laurie hits Michael in the head with fire extinguisher, grabs the kids and runs out. They get into Laurie's car and drive over to the school gate. Laurie has Molly and John drive down a mile, call the police for help, while she locks herself in and fights her brother one final time. <br /> <br />    They have a brief battle, where Michael slices Laurie's left arm in the same spot he did twenty years ago. She grabs two knifes and stabs the sh*t out of him until he is unconscious, but seemingly dead. She tries to stab him one final time, but Ronnie comes and stops her. The bullet only grazed Ronnie's head, so fortunately, Ronnie is fine. <br /> <br />    Laurie drives off with Michael, where they end up on the side of a hill. Trying to reach out to his little sister, Laurie grabs an axe and decapitates her brother, killing him once and for all. <br /> <br />    I was a little disappointed with this, since the late Dr. Loomis, is nowhere to be found, as well as this one being set in California, instead of Haddonfield, Illinois. The film is not scary as I hoped, but it is a worthy sequel.
B00097A5I6|5.0|Fans of great guitar driven music must buy this album. Every track is quality. Turn Up The Sun is Oasis's best opening track since Rock N' Roll Star. Mucky Fingers is a Bob Dylan meets Vevlet Underground (great lyrics by Noel). Lyla is pop anthem simular to Roll With It. Love Like a Bomb is a great little ditty with a suprise ending.  Importance of Being Idle is the best lyrics Noel has written since Live Forever with a nod to I'm Only Sleeping by the Beatles. Meaning of Soul is something Elvis would be proud of and leads in to Part of the Q another great Noel sung song.  Keep the Dream Alive is my least favorite as its Oasis by the Numbers but you can not argue that Liam is not on his best vocal on the track. Two Beatlesque tracks end the album in A Bell Will Ring (awesome Gem Archer song) and the Liam/Noel vocal that will blow you away. BUY THIS ALBUM!
B0007OCG4W|4.0|We just watched this movie last night, and it caught us off guard. Without any preconceived notions, I was totally ready for the proverbial chick flick. Boy, was I wrong! \\"Closer\\" is the latest work by Mike Nichols, the Director of \\"The Graduate\\" and \\"Angels in America\\" among other great works. Past the first half of the movie, one name kept coming to my mind: David Cronenberg. Granted that the movie is not repulsive in a physical sense, emotionally speaking, it pushes you hard and far to the point of turning sensuality repulsive and making love look like one crazy game.<br /><br />Natalie Portman once more delivers, just like in \\"Garden State\\". Jude Law plays one sick game-playing guy. Clive Owen kills me with his lines, his brutal \\"honesty\\" and his \\"open\\" mind. Julia Roberts typically delivers an average performance, but when pushed by his co-stars' lines, she also explodes with magnificence. Overall not meant to cheer you up on a gloomy day, but nevertheless a well acted movie with a fairly convoluted and twisted plot.
B000003S09|3.0|Yup, Crimsons first album may have been hugely influential for later prog rock bands such as Genesis, Gentle Giant, ELP (who bassist Greg Lake joined after leaving Crimson) but I've never really liked it much. Yes I know, I'm a blasphemer and I'm a Crim head too with 40+ albums in my collection. But I find the music on ITCOTKC to be too too serious with a real overearnest sense of buzzkill. The music is perfect technically, but with a few exceptions, devoid of life. The exceptions being the harrowing math metal 21st Century Schizoid Man where Fripp gets to crunch and shred, and I Talk To The Wind because of Ian McDonald's lyrical flute solo. But the rest of it, well the melodies are wonderful as on Epitaph but often the music is lugubrious, and WAY over serious. Lets not forget these guys were early 20 somethings when they wrote this. So I can forgive some of the earnest pretentiousness of youth. And I'm sure ITCOTCK was mindblowing in 1969. This is the album that popularized the mellotron and introduced the rock band as orchestra, and is one of the first progressive or art rock albums. But to me now 30 years later most of these songs sound pompous, murky and emotionally distant. They're not very  entertaining. For example the title track just drones on forever with one repetitious instrumental part after another. True there is a beautiful flute and guitar interlude but the song drags from portentious moment to portentious moment. The serious delivery just serves to make the song unintentionaly pompous. The lyrics of Pete Sinfield are also to blame in large part being about 'moonchildren\\" and \\"crimson kings\\". They haven't held up very well and though sometimes they are scathing in their social critique such as on 21st Century Schizoid Man, or Epitaph, they also travel far into annoying hippy territory such as on Moonchild. \\"Dropping circle stones on a sundial.  Playing hide and seek with the ghosts of dawn. Waiting for a smile from a sun child.\\" Yuck. By comparison to some of Crimson's contemporaries like the Peter Gabriel lead Genesis, or later Crimson albums like Lark's Tongue In Aspic (their fifth studio album) ITCOTCK comes off as over earnest, dated and because of KC's deadly seriousness, pretentious. It set the blueprint for subsequent progressive rock (Genesis had this album on the wall in their practice space) but in general it's not their most enjoyable work.<br /><br />Hugely influential? Yes.  A landmark recording? Definitely.  Fun to listen to?  Not as much as it could be.  This is a good album but I find there are other more satisfying works in the Crimson catalog.to some of Crimson's contemporaries like the Peter Gabriel lead Genesis, or later Crimson albums like Lark's Tongue In Aspic (their fifth studio album) ITCOTCK comes off as over earnest, dated and because of KC's deadly seriousness, pretentious.

B00004XONN|5.0|First time I listened to this ablum I hated it. Absolutely hated it. I wanted to break the cd. I listened to it again and started to like it. I really started to feel the music. 5 years later this is my favorite album ever. Radiohead is not my favorite band, but this cd really does something to me. The music is really like nothing else. I honestly can not describe in words the type of comfort and ease this album gives me. I cant expect everyone to like this album, but its worth a listen. If I were stuck on a desert island and I could only have one possession it would be Kid A. No contest. I cant recommend this album enough. It's beautiful...
B0008KLVG4|5.0|For the previous member who mentioned that there isn't much on this one that wasn't on the 25th anniversary, I have only 2 things to say: 1- You don't HAVE TO buy the 30th anniversary edition. 2- I don't have the 25th anniversary edition, so your comment is useless to me and to the other people who don't have it, but will get the 30th. I am tempted to buy it, though, just because you call the people who love it and want it suckers... :) (And I don't care if they come up in 5 years with a 35th anniversary set, I won't buy it.. or if I do, I'll sell my 30th first) <br />Enjoy the movie...
B00004TJFL|5.0|On October 31st, 1988, Michael Myers awakened and had tried to kill his niece, Jamie Lloyd. After he had been shot up by Ben Meeker and Dr. Loomis, Michael fell into a shaft and swam away into the river, as the police blew up the mineshaft. Michael stumbled upon an old hermit. He tried to kill the hermit, but Michael was in so much pain from the bullet wounds, he just simply passes out.<br /><br />  On October 30, 1989, one year later, JAMIE (again played by Danielle Harris) has been in a children's hospital to help her overcome the guilt for nearly killing Darlene Carruthers. Jamie has now lost control over her voice and is in a telepathic bond with her maddening uncle. She awakes from a nightmare and begins feeling MICHAEL MYERS (played by Donald L. Shanks) regaining consciousness after a year. He picks up his mask and kills the hermit that cared for him over the past year.<br /><br />  The next morning is now Halloween. In Jamie's bedroom is RACHEL (again played by Ellie Cornell). DR. LOOMIS (again played by Donald Pleasance) peeks in to check on everything, making sure the girls are okay.

It's Dr. Loomis calling, since Jamie felt Michael lurking around the house. Max has run out the door. Loomis tells Rachel to run outside and go to the nearest neighbor. She runs out in her bath towel and gets help from her next-door neighbor. Everything is settled. Five minutes later, as Rachel is getting dressed, Max, who has returned, starts barking. A picture falls, sending Rachel to check it out. As she looks at a picture of Jamie, which is the picture that fell, Michael appears and kills Rachel.<br /><br />  Jamie has another attack, as Dr. Loomis is back at the police station, talking to SHERIFF BEN MEEKER (again played by Beau Starr).<br /><br />  Tina returns to Rachel's, but she figures Rachel may have gone out to the country with her parents. As she walks around Rachel's house, Tina's girlfriend, SAMANTHA (played by Tamara Glynn) arrives. They walk through the park, as Tina's boyfriend, MIKE (played by Jonathan Chapin) drives up. The Sam and Tina get into the car and drive down to the local mini-mart, where SPITZ (played by Matthew Walker) works. Spitz helps Mike steal a few cases of beer to bring to the Tower Farm Party. After Spitz leaves, Michael comes up to Mike's car and scratches it, causing Mike to have a confrontation with Michael. But Michael kills him off.<br /><br />  The Halloween Pageant has arrived for the kids at the hospital.

B00070Q8DQ|5.0|Having laid the groundwork for this consistency with a slew of promising works in the early '90s, Nergal's bloodthirsty trio arguably hit their stride with 2000's Thelema.6, charged inexorably forward with 2002's Zos Kia Cultus, and, in 2004's follow-up, Demigod, they may well have completed what may one day be looked back upon as their defining, unholy trinity of masterful death/black metal. As well as being the result of outstanding production quality which is sadly a deficiency many metal bands try to hide under overpowering intensity, this relative immediacy owes a great deal to Behemoth's songwriting ability and agility, with devices like the amazing lead guitar runs, counter-point doom-slow riffs, clever use of sampling, and the odd acoustic guitar bit to ease the tension. Check this one ASAP!
B0000033OZ|5.0|Their debut LP, \\"Emerson, Lake & Palmer\\" (also referred to as the \\"Flight\\" album, after the dove on the cover) is a very good place to start for one that is curious as to what the buzz about ELP was all about.  You can hear exactly what set the musical world on its ear.  It gives a very good sense, as well, of what ELP was (and would be) all about.   <br /> <br />Six tracks cover quite a musical spectrum, starting with the instrumental \\"The Barbarian,\\" a primal Hammond-heavy track with a classical/jazz trio middle.   <br /> <br />\\"Take a Pebble\\" (their first released single) features Keith Emerson's technically astounding fluid piano playing (especially an extended piano improvisation somewhere in the middle) and introduces the stunningly rich voice of Greg Lake.  Greg also shows off some acoustic guitar chops in the middle as well.   <br /> <br />\\"Knife-edge\\" returns to the heavier sound of the first track, and incorporates some Bach-like improvisation in the middle.  <br /> <br /> Keith Emerson's suite \\"The Three Fates\\" is another amped-up instrumental classical-type work (Think Cathedral-Bach meets Rachmaninoff meets Dave Brubeck Trio meets Road Rage).   <br /> <br />Emerson and Carl Palmer's \\"Tank\\" features Palmer's lightning-fast drumming, and some well-patched mini-Moog improvising.   <br /> <br />Their most famous song, Lake's ballad \\"Lucky Man,\\" was a last minute addition to the collection when they came up a little short on material.  This one made the Top 40 and introduced an unsuspecting public to the big and beefy Moog sound.  It is simply beautiful example of perfectly-crafted pop balladeering. <br /> <br />If you've never owned an ELP album, this one (and their extended live album, \\"\\"Welcome Back My Friends to the Show That Never Ends . . . Ladies and Gentlemen, Emerson, Lake & Palmer\\") should be one of your first two choices.
B000929AJQ|1.0|Anyone who truly appreciates NIN for its brilliance and innovation will not like this album one bit. The lyrics are detestable, while the music is often lost and unnatractively dissonant. 'With Teeth' plays more like an industrial Staind album that Nine Inch Nails. Some of the songs on the album are so bad they just make me laugh, while the album as a whole is so cluttered it made me vomit on one occasion. 'With Teeth' has potential to be a mildly decent ablum, however, the lyrics read and sound as if they were written by a 16 year old boy, which Trent has regressed to in making the album.
B000002AS3|4.0|Oasis has gone from biggest to less, competed with Blur, and fought a lot.  Before all that though Oasis started with \\"Definitely Maybe\\", a strong debut for a strong band. <br /> <br />One reason for this is that Oasis, probably more then any band at the time, tied themselves either musically or lyrically to the Beatles.  Comparisons can be made, but Oasis draws it out probably past deserved, but this is a bit deserved. <br /> <br />Then again, Oasis also was able to pull out, what I believe Blur could not on their debut, a couple of good, strong singles.  Specifically, those would be Supersonic and Live Forever.  Because with these Oasis made some strong instrumental waves, but also preceded many favorites from \\"What's The Story (Morning Glory)\\". <br /> <br />Easy enough Oasis shot out of the gates bringing British rock to the forefront, and they could not have done it without the work done on \\"Definitely Maybe\\".
B000002ORU|5.0|Im not going do like most reviews and give one star for one stupid reason. This boxset is four cds of greatest hits? b-sides? I really cant understand what this boxset is trying to accomplish. The five star rating is for the music with in the box set. The Who take elements from mostly every major band of the era, and is blended into one beautiful music group. Here's the breakdown: <br /> <br />There songwriting ability is on par with Beatles, they are badder then the Rolling Stones, they play like Led Zeppelin, they jam like the Greatful Dead and Led Zeppelin, and they have mystique of Pink Floyd. One thing that boggles the mind is they seem to be forgotten in time. The Who should be in the top 5 or even 3 bands of all time, because they havent made many major mistakes like Zeppelin has.
B00097A5I6|3.0|Let me take you back to the mid-nineties, a time when Rock and Roll bands rules the radiowaves and there was no bigger band at the time as the Gallagher brothers of Oasis. It didn't hurt them that sibling rivalry was as entertaining (or sometimes more entertaining) than the music. But around the third album, the luster of the band wore off and they started to put out mediocre album one after another with the song Stop Crying Your Heart Out being the one bright spot in recent memory.  <br /> <br />Mediocrity continues with the release of Don't Believe the Truth. But for a band that who unapologetically rip-off the Beatles as on this album they steal from other English bands. A Bell Will Ring sounds like a Rolling Stones song. Lyla sounds like something The Kinks might have done. The Stone Roses get the Oasis makeover on Turn Up the Sun.  <br /> <br />Oasis even borrows from a newer band as Mucky Fingers takes from the signature Coldplay crushing guitars. They even get some influences from across the pond with the 60's garage rock of The Meaning of Soul. Part of the Queue percussion sound particularly reminiscent of the Red Hot Chili Peppers' Breaking the Girl.  <br /> <br />But Oasis shines when they stick to what they do best, and of course that lifting Beatles music. Love Like a Bomb and Guess God Thinks I'm Abel both fit the bill. The Noel takes over sing duties on The Importance Of Being Idle also fits in that category. But the highlight of the album is the closer, Let There Be Love, the first time I'm aware of where the Gallagher brother actually share vocal duties on the same song.  <br /> <br />The album starts off with the lyrics, \\"I carry the madness everywhere I go.\\" Too bad its not the same kind of madness that put a single of the brother on the English charts so many years ago. That is the Oasis I wish would come back.
B00008DDSC|3.0|Am I the only reviewer that has read the short story that this film was based on?   I've read over fifty of the reviews, and there has been no mention of the source material.    In any case, this movie is based (very loosely) on a short story by Mary Gaitskill, in a book published circa 1989 called \\"Bad Behavior\\".      Gaitskill is a phenomenally gifted writer, and much more intelligent than the people who produced and directed this film.  I haven't read anywhere what her opinion of the movie is, but I'll tell you mine.    Hollywood regularly takes the works of fiction writers and bastardizes them in order to make them more appealing to  audiences.  Usually this means juicing something up with more titillation.  In this case, they took a dark, Darwinistic look at office politics and sex and turned it into a sweetened, Mary Poppins-in-whips-and-chains postfeminist movie in the vein of \\"Fatal Attraction\\", \\"Pretty Woman\\", and \\"Basic Instinct.\\"    Look at it this way:  when an author describes a rather repugnant lawyer masturbating behind his secretary as \\"making furious rodent-like sounds\\" and \\"spattering hot muck\\", do you think she (the author) is sympathetic towards the character?    They turned a seedy (pun intended) low-life lawyer into a matinee idol--James Spader, and made the secretary into an unawakened freethinker, when in the book she was a character with basically no sense of herself at all, and certainly no self esteem.    Maggie Gyllenhaal (lately in the news for speaking her mind about 9-11) is superb in this movie, I'll grant you that.  She is a young actress on the rise.  But the rest of the cast, including Spader, give very forgettable performances.  The movie just isn't that well made, and when you see the director's interviews, you'll understand why.    I would recommend that anyone intrigued by this movie investigate Mary Gaitskill's writing.  Besides \\"Bad Behavior\\", she wrote a novel called \\"Two Girls, Fat and Thin\\"  which is an excellent dissection of the philosophy of Ayn Rand.  Of course, if Hollywood adapted that book for a movie, it would probably come out resembling \\"Atlas Shrugged\\"....
B000002JSN|5.0|Physical Graffiti is so awesome, every song a classic!
B0007DAZW8|5.0|I saw plenty of pretty negative reviews about Daft Punk's latest album, Human After All. Many used to fancy Daft Punk as party animals of the 90's. Now Human After All came out and almost everyone must have sent it straight back to the $0.99 Cent bin. What I may have noticed is that the reason they hate it is that Daft Punk is so focused on their own form of a project, that reviewers are all expecting a new Homework or Discovery. The truth is that the reviewers are more focused on the music than what Human After All is trying to bring to the table. So here I am to try and see if I can explain my view of the real interior of Human After All:    \\"Human After All\\": The song pretty much explains that they are humans under robot suits. This is a Discovery influence. (See: Harder Better Faster Stronger)    \\"Prime Time Of Your Life\\": The distorted cooing must be a clue that every piece in this musical puzzle is supposed to symbolize a life cycle for a Human. The speeding up of a repeating beat is supposed to symbolize that whem you get older (50+) tume will fly often fast, and before you know it, you are pushing up daisies in the graveyard (the exploding stars).    \\"Robot Rock\\": The songs sound like they are doing another Discovery influence while cranking the guitar up a notch. As you may ave known, more and more music fans are saying that Electronica sucks, and that using instruments like...a guitar and drums is the brand new thing. Daft Punk on the sounds sounds as if they don't mindadjusting to their demands. OF course, rock these says may be catchy, but they're terribly repetitive (Creed, Nickelback, The La's \\"There She Goes\\"). The fact that the music is repetitive is more of a trigger to remind you how such a repetitive, if not mediocre, song becomes a big hit. So...they picked up guitars and served it up just the way you like it.    \\"Steam Machine\\": The only song that is worthy of being a B-Side really.    \\"Make Love\\": Discovery. Daft Punk gets romantic and tries to mirror the fact that not only do humans all fall in love all of the time. This has nothing to do with music anymore.    \\"The Brainwasher\\": Evryone has someone telling them what is real and what is unreal. Everyone knows something that plays a brainwasher, whether it is TV or your latest best friend. The song playing with a dance beat all the while mezmorizing.    \\"On/Off\\": \\"On/Off\\" is an intro to \\"Television Rules The Nation\\". The filpping of the channels trigger the fact that there is ust nothing good worth watching on your TV. Survivor, The Simple Life and Unfabulous is not but art imitating life.    \\"Television Rules The Nation\\":  \\"\\"When I was a little kid my mother told me not to stare into the sun. So one day when I was six, I did...the next day I had my first headache.\\"  ~Max Cohen in p. What is more popular than Money? Who raises your children? What is a cheat sheet for imagination? That's right. Television sets. These days, television rules the nation. Who do you know is not brainwashed into thinking that everything on TV is sheer reality, these days? (Watch Friends, Jerry Springer, and That's So Raven, and tell me nothing on that show is true this century. ) It is only a matter of time before a mirror turns back into a window.    \\"Technologic\\": This album, to me, reaches Homework heights. Once again, the music sounds much like it was custom made for an iPod commercial or digital cameras. Actually, I think that is what the song is about. Everything you want to do is by machines. iPod, Electronic music, digital cameras, and the lot. Nothing is primitive anymore.     \\"Emotion\\": This emotionally influenced song, to me, is no different from the emotionally charged song from M83 called \\"Run Into Flowers\\".     So there you have it. Human After All to hardcore fans are what Christians are to the word \\"it\\".  They don't know the meaning of the album, because they are getting too much into the right-winged meaning of the album. All it is is an album that is proved bad if it isn't given more time at it.     None of this was new.  When Liars came out with They Were Wrong, So We Drowned, reviewers quickly denounced it as unlistenable as toolazy to be \\"songs\\". But the album is no different from their other stuff except thsat it has gotten a bit more punk-influenced and different. When Slipknot came out with a 4th album called Vol. 3 (The Subliminal Messages), fans thought it was garbage. But their subliminal message is that every great band ends up making bad music in the mainstream Industry.  When Chumbawamba came out with WYSIWYG, people were too busy worrying about their catchy single, Tubthumping, to find out that Chumbawamba is actually an anarchist band. With that, the album didn't sell as much. When Emotive was released by the least-likely band, A Perfect Circle, fans were crushed to find that Tool desecndants created such albums...and on Election Day. But it was A Perfect Circle's plan to take a risk and create the album for the good of America. So every \\"bad\\" album must have a reason to be \\"bad\\", right? Well, these sure do have a few. This one is just a carefully thought-out concept album that requires idas about different suites of the album.
B00097A5I6|4.0|Dont believe the truth is a great album. Oasis returns after 3 years away with a slightly mellower sound and some very un-Oasis sounding moments. All in all a great effort well worth picking up by old and new fans alike. <br /> Stand out tracks Liam penned Guess God thinks I'm Able and A bell will ring.
B0006L16N8|5.0|I was hooked on Coldplay after I heard the song \\"Clocks\\" during the Brit Awards a couple of years ago. I then listened to the Rush Of Blood and Parachutes. In my opinion, Parachutes had more solid song structure, but the Rush of Blood had more better singles. X&Y on the other hand is something on entirely new level. The songs are catchy and very pleasant. \\"Square One\\" is a great opener and the album sounds really well-polished all the way to the last hidden track of \\"Til Kingdom Come\\".<br />When you get your copy keep in mind these songs:<br />Square One,<br />What If? (X&Y's version of Trouble),<br />White Shadows,<br />Talk,<br />A Message (X&Y's version of Parachuts and Yellow mixed together), and, surely,<br />Fix You (most touching lyrics in the whole album)<br />because then you will have to listen to the whole album again just to realize what a magical piece of work this is.

0790730960|5.0|The fist two batman which has been directed by tim burton were really oscar worthy movies, great actings, great cast selection, no one could play batman as good as michael keaton and there was not better match for catwoman than michelle pfiffer. If I say this maybe some accuse me as a racist but I'm not! I'm a Blade fan, but, when I heard of the catwoman movie with halle berry, a black woman as catwoman, I laughed loud and loud. there could never be a worse match! anyway, as usual, the complain is about the DVD release. It's very old back to 1997, a double sided dvd which include both full screen and widescreen of the movie. the quality is really not good and there is no special features. nothing. well, it is an old release and I dont know why when they release some movie several times on DVD, why they don't do same on these important movies?  there is a four disc boxed set too which contains all 4 batman movies started with tim burton's 1988 batman. but it's not worth to buy too cause, there is 4 double sided single layer dvds with no special features and the worst part is, it had the last sequel, with george cloony as batman, although val kilmer for the third part was not a good match but this one was absolutely riculous!  I don't know any of studio managers would see this review or not but I suggest they release first two parts as an special collector's 3 disc edition. two high difinition picture transfer DVD plus a DTS soundtrack and a 3rd disc of special features. also release the 3rd part individually as another collector;s or special edition and totally forget about the last part!  anyway, this movie worth everything, even buying this old release till they release a better verion! and, maybe helpful to say I contacted with studio to find out if they had an schedule to release new versions of batman movie, but the answer was NO!
B00005MP58|5.0|The movie of my life! Can it get any better?? It is simply life changing and truly my favorite movie of all time.  Colin Firth made Mr. Darcy sexy!  His intelligence and sexuality, and 'Englishness' shines through. He has acted superbly in this adaptation, conveying sooo much by saying so little...And he truly posseses the most beautiful male voice, the delivery of all his lines was music to my ears!!! Buy this, it is a classic handsome enough to tempt anyone...
1400032717|5.0|is told in the first person by Christopher John Francis Boone, a 15 year old autistic boy, who sets off on a detective mission to discover who killed his neighbor's dog. Christopher counts forward in prime numbers, can't tolerate the colors yellow or brown, avoids strangers, is easily overwhelmed by noise or crowds, and always tells the truth.<br /><br />We don't often get a glimpse into the minds and worlds of people so different from ourselves. Author Mark Haddon takes us on a touching journey of how this boy's world unravels and comes together again as he bumps up against the very real human failings of those closest to him. We feel his anguish and also the comfort he finds in his world of abstract problem solving. The book has several mind-stumping math problems, that Christopher delights in solving for us. One in particular, the Monty Hall problem, was really annoying. It's the kind of problem that makes you sit down, take out a pen and paper and try to make sense of it. But you can't. Or most people can't. I think that is part of the interesting charm of this book. We the readers are as closed off to the world which Christopher inhabits, as he is to our world. As smart as I was in math, these problems confused me, made my brain hurt. As brilliant as Christopher is, it takes every ounce of his mental focus to take a simple subway ride.<br /><br />Highly recommended.
B0008KLVG4|5.0|I just recently viewed the film, JAWS, in it's entirety.  My brother Michael, who is now deceased, loved this film, so I figured why not get the film?  Little did I know the studio would soon release yet another commerative edition...the ultimate one!!!!  I feel absolutely no pressure to purchase the latest edition just to prove myself worthy to be called a \\"true fan\\".  For those of you out there who feel the need to keep in touch with the editions, know that the cover artwork may change, the special features list will grow, but the film will remain exactly the same.  The only reason the studios keep re-releasing the same films with different added value content is because we keep buying them!  Here's what I know will transpire on June 14th.  People will go to Wal-Mart, Costco, etc, wherever they go to purchase the new releases and they will see the newest Jaws edition wrapped in shiny plastic.  Those of us who feel no need to pay the studio will move on with our lives.  You do not owe the studio a dime!  And yes, so long as you keep purchasing new and updated editions, they will continue to make \\"anniversary editions\\".  Just keep that in mind.....
B00030590I|3.0|It was definitely one of the best epic movies I've ever seen. other friends discuss about it much, but I have to complain about the DVD release in USA! or even the premiere in USA! Us release version of the feature is 10 minutes shorter than Chinese version cause of PG problems. No one can accuse them cause they want to make more money and there is no problem with it, although this movie originally could not be a child's favorite cause he or she, can not understand it! anyway, they released it on DVD exaclty like they released it in theaters! A PG-13 DVD. I bought this movie from singapore even before it's premiere in USA. Asian release of this movie does not only has 10 minutes additional scenes but much more special features than us release. it only has no english langulage track, who cares? I'm sure most of people like me prefer to watch movies in their original language with english subtitles. anyway, it could be good if amazon.com offer the asian impoert version of this movie beside the us release dvd and if they do it, i strongly suggest you to buy the asian release at any additional cost cause it's worth it.

0812550706|5.0|Winner of the Hugo and Nebula Awards, Ender's Game by Orson Scott Card revolves around a young boy, Ender Wiggin, who is selected to train to become a fleet commander to protect earth from an alien invasion. The training takes place at a distant Battle School in space where the young and brilliant Ender is repeatedly pushed to his limits to mold him into what he is needed to be, to become the next commander and win the war against the invaders.<br /><br />I've read Ender's Game 5 or 6 times in the last 15 years, and recently listened to the audiobook. I honestly think that Ender's Game is the best piece of science fiction I have ever read. Card is unusual as a science fiction writer in that he delves deeply into the psychology of his main characters and their complex inter-relationships. Nothing is as black and white as it may seem. There is goodness and honor in Ender's enemies as well as a willingness to manipulate and kill in Ender. Ender is constantly faced with hard choices upon which his survival and the fate of the planet depend.<br /><br />An important subplot takes place on earth between Ender's good sister Valentine and his sociopathic brother Peter, also young children. The two equally brilliant siblings take advantage of the anonymity of the net to pose as adults and publish opposing politcal articles, building strong followings and ultimately influencing the shape of world government. What is remarkable is that Card first published Ender's Game as a short story in 1985, well before the Internet became publicly available. In fact, the vision of the Net that Card lays out in Ender's game is just now beginning to be realized, some 20 years later. That two people could move nations by their writings on the web is plausible, whereas when this book was written it was still very much a fantasy. Card related in an interview that he had played around with an early version of Delphi and was inspired by the possibilities he saw.<br /><br />The first time I read this book it was for a management class on leadership and training - how to provide an environment where people around you could grow professionally. I found most of the book brutal to read, especially the first chapter in which Ender is being tormented by his brother. The cruelty, ambition, win-at-any-cost world portrayed was not (and is not) the world I wanted to see. Yet it is against this stark background that Ender and Valentine's moral centers shine. So perhaps it is an effective narrative device needed to create the core conflict of the story. Without conflict, we would all sit around, smile, and drink tea; there would be no story to tell. Ender's trials at the Battle School are riveting and once I made it that far into the book I couldn't put it down.<br /><br />In the last chapter of Ender's Game the entire premise of the book is shaken and we are set up for the next stage of Ender's Life in the sequel, Speaker for the Dead. The Ender Wiggin series is actually five books, with Ender's Game representing maybe 5% of the total, more like a prologue. The whole series is fantastic. In this world there is so much room for story and character development that Card writes a completely different version of the events of Ender's Game from the perspective of one of the other characters in Ender's Shadow and its sequel Shadow of the Hegemon.<br /><br />If you are considering the audiobook, I highly recommend it. It is unabridged and several voices are effectively used for the characters and narration.<br /><br />Look for the movie Ender's Game to come out in the next few years; there's one in the works. If they do it right I predict it will be the next Star Wars or Matrix.read this book it was for a management class on leadership and training - how to provide an environment where people around you could grow professionally.

B00005JMX6|4.0|That girl is gorgeous and just look at that bod, Matthew thinks as he walks into a garbage can out side his house.<br /><br />Later, while Matthew is upstairs in his bedroom when he sees her, in the house next door, through his window and she's UNDRESSING! Just as she finishes taking off the last piece, she turns around quickly and looks Matthew straight in the face. A shy and shocked Matthew quickly ducks below the window sill and after a minute, slowly, ever so slowly, peeks over the sill but the girl is gone.<br /><br />Just then Matthew (Emile Hirsch) hears the doorbell ring and his parents call for him. He comes out of the bedroom and there with his parents is the girl. \\"Oh Oh\\" he thinks \\"She's telling them I'm a voyeur, a Peeping Tom\\". The girl, Danielle is her name, has a Cheshire smile on her face, then his mother says Danielle is new in town and wonders if you could show her around town.<br /><br />Unknown to Matthew, who is the not so popular class president in high school and about to graduate, is that Danielle (Elisha Cuthbert) has been in pornographic films and is trying to break away from the business. This fact is thrust upon Matthew by one of his nerdy friends, Eli (Chris Marquette), who is obsessed with pornography, when he begins to show him one of Danielle's films.<br /><br />So begins The Girl Next Door A racy teenage comedy directed by Luke Greenberg and written by screenwriters David Wagner and Brent Goldberg, which bounces back and forth between Matthew's High School, when he has earned new found credibility because of his foxy new girlfriend and the annual Pornography Convention in - where else - Las Vegas in a tug of war for Danielle with Kelly (Timothy Olyphant), her former adult film producer with designs of landing her back in front of the camera.<br /><br />Conclusion<br /><br />I liked this film but I didn't love it. The story was clever and some of the situations were funny but I found the subject matter a little silly if not distasteful. I had only seen the two lead actors before and they had both played petulant, surly teenagers, Hirsch as the troublesome son of a senator in one of my favorite movies \\"The Emperors Club\\" and Cuthbert as the querulous daughter in the TV series 24 Hours . My impression of both actors has improved with this movie. Neither was great but they performed in a yeomanship manner and despite the subject matter their characters were upbeat and impressive. Cuthbert has blossomed from the temperamental child/woman of 24 Hours into a very attractive and sensuous actress. I look forward to more work from both actors. Another bright spot was the kinky quirky acting of Timothy Olyphant. One minute a friend the next an enemy, he played the part to a tee. Cheers for Olyphant. Matthews two nerdy sidekicks also gave good performances<br /><br />There is a R Rated version and an unrated version. I watched the unrated version which had some nudity (surprise) but only in cameo appearances from minor actresses and at the porn convention. That's right, only girls, no guys. Sorry, girls, equal rights hasn't progressed that far.<br /><br />Despite the fact that this is a so called \\"teen comedy\\", you might want to keep any teens under, say seventeen away from the racy unrated version.<br /><br />Overall I found the movie to be entertaining, Final rating a low four stars @ 3.6y if not distasteful.

0156027321|5.0|It was riveting.  I do not understand how anyone could be bored by it (as many one-star reviewers claim).   I like the story-as-told-by device... it reminds me of Joseph Conrad.  Like Conrad, Martel brings the reader face to face with darkness and its ability to awaken and transform the human spirit.
B00000IQMT|2.0|This soundtrack is pathetic compared to the old trilogy and the Episode III soundtrack.    <br />    While \\"Duel of the Fates\\" \\"The Droid Invasion\\" and \\"The Sith Spacecraft\\"  are excellent, most others like \\"Anakin's Theme\\"  Jar Jar's Introduction\\" and \\"Augie's Municipal Band\\" are terrible. The band one is so retarded!  There are people singing idiotic lyrics as children laugh. The rest non-kiddie tracks are totally bland, boring junk that doesn't deserve the name \\"Star Wars.\\"  <br />     DO NOT believe the 5 star reviews.  If you do, you'll just get  buyers remorse.
B00005V3Z4|4.0|Donnie Darko hits a cord with so many young viewers because it's all about not belonging. Imagine a world that you aren't supposed to be in, then imagine receiving all of these clues that you don't understand telling you so, and all of the repercussions that your very existence can have.<br /><br />Once you try to put that together throw in a scary looking giant rabbit, a child porn king, your little sister's dance competition, and a turbine jet engine falling out of the sky.<br /><br />If you can even begin to stitch how these all fit together then you will begin to understand Donnie Darko as a film. If you can begin to understand the film you may begin to peel it back again layer by layer and see how much more the movie says about the human psyche and how we all interact and relate to one another and how everything we do has some rebound effect somewhere else.<br /><br />It makes you think. The only reason I don't give this 5 stars is because you really do have to watch it so many times to understand everything that is going on, and in the end I don't think the director wants you to. This is one of those movies you have to interpret for yourself but not something you should pass over.
0060763280|2.0|This was not one of my favorite books in this genre by any measure.   It seemed as though the Author was intent on convincing the reader that he/she must attend his seminar, and while I'm sure that would be a good experience, it is definately not what I was looking for when I purchased this book.  I know of several books of this genre that are far better than this one.  This books promises more than it delivers.
B0002NRRAG|2.0|Though wonderful music is chosen for Peyroux's covers, her voice is not as unique as Starbucks would like you to believe. She sounds like Billie Holliday with a cold, and her cover of \\"Between the Bars\\" personally offends me as a diehard Elliott Smith fan. The orignal had a beauty to balance the pain. Her version is just dark and dull.
B00003CX95|5.0|While long and gory, this movie delivers.   The acting of Mel Gibson and the others in this movie is totally flawless.  Mel's fake(it doesn't sound like it) accent must have taken much practice and determination.            The landscape of the movie is breathtaking, much like in \\"The Lord of the Rings.\\"  From the grassy planes to mountains, this movie sends you to Scotland.         The amazing score is another piece of the puzzle, as without it, the movie would not be the same.  Sad music blends with good   old bagpipe music.           The fighting scenes, which are my favorite, are extremely realistic with blood and gore.  The weapons used are authentic.  When bows are pulled back, it is done with effort, unlike most other movies where bows are pulled back with absolutely no effort whatsoever.          There are very sad moments like when William's soon-to-be wife is killed and when he yells \\"FREEDOM!!\\" that bring tears to my eyes.          This movie gets two thumbs WAY up and should definately be added to your DVD collection.
B00000G3AZ|4.0|Finally a period piece that doesn't focus on what the characters are wearing or how perfect the dialogue is so much as whether the story is enjoyable to watch. Emma is fun to watch. It's predictable and has the standard rouster of characters for this type of movie but that doesn't matter. If you want to see an unpretentious period piece with a superb cast and a happy ending all around then Emma is a great movie.
0451207521|5.0|I read Jackdaws by Ken Follett.  It is about the time before the attack on Normandy, France.  Flick is the main character in this book.  Flick and her husband Michael are the head leaders of the Bollinger Circuit of the French resistance against the Nazi Germans invading France. Their mission in this book is to blow up a communications depot that is the main source of telecommunications of Rommel's 10th Panzer divisions in North Africa.  Franck Dieter is a major of the German army.  He was assigned to find Flick and her all woman team of resistance.  The Gestapo plays a major part in this book, especially in their attempts to catch flick and the other women. This book is a excellent book and I highly recommend it. Five-Stars.
0441009425|4.0|For the person who is thoroughly amazed by cutting-edge science and its applications, and who can get engrossed in an epic on this scale, this is an excellent book.  I am such a person, and it's been a while since I read a book that was so interesting and informative.  Reynolds is like Crichton in his ability to educate the reader while telling a riveting story.  The technology in the book all seems very realistic, particularly in computers and where the technology of electronics is headed.  I found the Sun Stealer idea revealed early on to give the story its needed element of mystery that would sustain it, although I agree with other reviewers that the way in which the mystery is revealed later on can get frustrating.  The first 80 or so pages also seemed to drag, but suspense picks up and doesn't drop off for the rest of the story. <br /> <br />My other major complaints with the story are the characters and dialogue.  Reynolds does NOT have a gift for creating interesting and tangible characters.  They aren't terrible; they're just all stereotypes of militaristic science fiction that we're all used to by now.  The dialogue is also very strange.  Every line from every character, and even the character's thoughts, is overly eloquent and drawn out.  It's as if someone threw the entire staff of and Ivy League philosophy and english department into an action movie to deliver ultimatums.  This is very irritating after a few hundred pages or so. <br /> <br />Aside from these gripes, the story is suspenseful, and original enough not to make finishing the book into a chore.  Reynolds knows his science and is not afraid to show it and educate the reader.  Recommended for anyone with a scientific mind.
B00005YU1O|1.0|There is a popular misconception that seems to float about among these psuedointelectual film school types; that being that reading a synopsis of the philosophies of Jean-Paul Sartre or Albert Camus and inserting the resultant vague understanding thereof into a film, well, that clearly equates to absolute genius.  Waking Life, Richard Linklater's pompous foray into the realm of intelectual masterbation, has masterfully exploited this misguided notion and made a whole lot of money to boot.<br /><br />The film is little more than a series of philosophical treatise, vainly refferencing the existentialists through heavy-handed monologues and pretentious one-liners.  These hackneyed vinettes are loosely strung together under the flimsy pretext of a plot involving a young man who may or may not be dead meandering through a variety of dreams.  In the end, what I will begrudgingly reffer to as \\"the plot\\" serves as little more than a soapbox upon which Linklater can stand and announce, \\"Behold!  I am inteligent!  I understand the way life works!  Prostrate yourselves, oh ye less learned masses, before my mighty intelect!\\"<br /><br />As for the film's key selling point, the high-tech stylized animation rendered on top of the film, it does a fantastic job of reinforcing the self-important obsessions of the filmmaker.  What would otherwise have been an excedingly dull picture has roped in countless people based solely on a cheap-ass gimmick.  That's all it is.  An insulting gimmick designed to dress up an utterly stupid and self-agrandizing piece of celluloid trash.<br /><br />Now I realize that this is not a popular take on the film.  It's far easier to praise it as a piece of modern philosophical gold, to laud Linklater as the intelectual messiah, but the fact is that he has made a film expousing the philosophical views of a well-read tenth-grader and passing them off as being spawned from his own fertile (or perhaps not) imagination.  We get it, Rich.  You read a book on existentialism.  Now shut up and go make Dazed and Confused 2: Electric Bugaloo.on existentialism.  Now shut up and go make Dazed and Confused 2: Electric Bugaloo.
B000002J09|5.0|Ignore what that Lobster boy said below me..... If he thinks that all the new bands are the ones with the talent he has some serious problems.I mean seriously, Slipknot?? are you kidding me?  <br /> <br /> Anyway, this is one of the greatest albums ever by in my opinion, the greatest band of all time. Enough said.
1400032717|4.0|Mark Haddon's debut novel is in first person, narration by an autistic, 15 year old boy, Christopher. <br />The book starts with the incident of a dog being killed in Christopher's neighborhood and how the boy tries to solve the mystery. <br />One thing leads to another and the boy discovers many hidden truths about his own life. <br /> <br />The book reveals many details of an autistic boy - his likes and dislikes, his way of thinking etc.  <br />He is very good at math but finds it difficult to understand people's expressions and interepret what they are thinking. <br />He knows every prime number upto 7,057 and hates to be touched or hugged. <br />He knows all the countries of the world and thier capitals and has no understanding of human emotions. <br /> <br /> <br />The book has an easy flow. Its an easy read - short chapters, simple, non-ornate language.  <br />There are many pictures in the book that make it interesting.  <br />For people who like math, there is a solved math problem in the appdendix. <br /> <br />The best thing I liked about the book is -- even though the narration is by a boy who has no idea of emotions, the book turns out be quite emotional. <br />Though the boy does not say anything emotions, the book makes you feel sad. <br />Another good thing about the book is its ending. I am usually disappointed by the ending of a book, but this book did not let me down. <br />The book ends as smoothly as it reads. <br /> <br />All in all, a good book. Try it! If you like it - well and good. If you don't, feel good for not wasting a lot of time on this!
B0009MDPYM|1.0|I tried not to read the reviews for this film in order to judge for myself on the film's worth but after I was able to catch this at my local dollar theater, I have to say that the reviews don't do it justice. The movie is horrible and Keanu can't act to save his life. From the horrible first exorcism scene to the bad ending, the film just does not find itself in a good position to entertain you, not to mention keep you awake in order to find out what happens in the end of the film. The special effects are decent but it does not make the film any better and in certain spots take away from what this film was really about, which in essence is nothing interesting at all. Rachel Weisz's performance is the best thing about this movie and that's a miracle in itself because of how bad the script is written.  She's so good in this film that you really do end up wishing that she and her character could some how escape the movie and that she could take you with her because her performance is more interesting than the entire film as a whole.  <br /> <br />I don't know what went through the minds of the people making this film but judging by the finish product, it was probably nothing.  <br />
0887307280|4.0|\\"The E-Myth\\" talks about reasons why most small businesses don't work.  Essentially it boils down to the fact that most small business owners are still \\"employees\\" at heart and don't understand their responsibilities as the business leader and manager.<br /><br />The ideas for overcoming this fatal flaw involve looking at your business as if you are creating a franchise.  To do this requires that you work \\"on your business\\" and not \\"in your business\\" by creating a \\"primary aim\\" along with detailed, organized systems for your organization.  The concepts seem to be solid and logical, but the book was just that.... concepts and no real meat.<br /><br />I would have liked to have seen more specific examples in this book.  While there is a running story throughout the book, it merely reviews and restates the concepts that are introduced in the chapter.  I would have rather seen a brief overview of the important points of the chapter, and then an example that shows the specific steps of how to do each of the concepts the author talks about.<br /><br />Regardless of its shortcomings, \\"The E-Myth\\" is still a good book for entrepreneurs to read.  Just expect to come away with more questions than answers.  4 out of 5 stars.
B00097A5I6|5.0|Best Oasis album since \\"Morning Glory\\"! The last song on the album  entitled \\"let There be Love\\" may actually be as good as \\"Wonderwall. Pure pop perfection.
0385513755|5.0|The Vatican can throw all the hissy fits it wants to about this book, but it is still one of the most fascinating, thought-provoking, and well-researched novels of this young century, second only to Bill Jabanoski's \\"Scarecrow,\\" which is a far more powerful work because of its subject matter and because, as well as Brown writes, he is really not in the same league of genius as Jabanoski.<br /><br />Although I'd already read this novel three times over [plus, like everyone else, all of Brown's previously ignored earlier works afterwards], I still bought this illustrated edition and enjoy it immensely. I wish they'd published the book in this form in the first place so I didn't have to half wear out my computer going on the internet to check the artwork to see if the things he said were there were.<br /><br />Even if you've already read the book, get this edition. Let's face it, it is one of those books you'll be reading and rereading for years, and this new edition gives pictures to the words.
B00013RC8O|3.0|First, let me point out that this remake starring Viggo Mortensen is more appropriate for post 9/11 America than during the America of President Clinton. While it is true, that this remake was released not too long after the bombing of Oklahoma City, Ruby Ridge, and the Waco fiasco, I believe that the Government reaction was more in tune with the paranoia of terrorism now than what it would it would have been in 1996 or 1997. President Bush probably would have labeled Kowalski in league with Osama Bin Laden!  <br />Anyway, both movies have their pros and cons: Both have shaky plots: A car chase across the western states? Excitement galore!!! <br />But there is something about the original that the remake cannot touch. It may be the free spirit that the original had. After all, the original was released in 1970. <br /> <br />However, the remake had a better back story (the wife in the hospital) and it gave the crash a bit more humanity. the remake erred when it suggested that Kowalski could have survived. Let the audience draw their own conclusion.  <br /> <br />The crash in the original was the end of the movie. I liked the indifference of the spectators. After Newman's Kowalski crashed, the people seemed to shrug and leave after the debacle. It was as if the people saw their excitement for the day then went back to their daily routine.
044022165X|5.0|John Grishams novel The Rainmaker was filled with interesting and unexpected turns from the begining through the end.  It was near impossible for me to put down this book, even to eat.  I highly suggest it to anyone of all ages who is looking for a fast paced exciting read.
0975991477|1.0|It seems pretty obvious that this book is trash.  I know that is a harsh thing to say, but it really is the most vaccuous book I've read in a long time.  Most have expertly dissect the book's flaws already and dismissed it for the waste of money and time that it is.    [...]  I got my book last week and read it over the the past week and holiday weekend.  What a major disappointment.      Many people have already commented on this, but I have to chime in.  If it is true that people can affect their health by just \\"thinking right,\\" then, first, where is the proof of this and, second, how do you \\"think right\\" and what exactly is \\"thinking right?\\"      Well I don't know, because the authors never tell the reader. [...]     Whatever might have been the motive, the book was really a terrible read with no practical purpose or point whatsoever.  It was in short a major disappointment.  It really proved total rubish.
0765301598|2.0|It has been stated many times that this book lacks any substance in comparrison to any book in the Dune Chronicles, so I find no need to expound on that area.  Imagine this though, when all of the books are finally written and this trilogy is seen as the first, how many people are going to just give up reading the series and miss out on the brilliant works of Frank Herbert because of the atrocities found here?  The authors should be ashamed of themselves and by looking at their website they probably are.  The don't have a \\"Contact Us\\" page anywhere.  Maybe they have finally realized their folly and will put their noses to the grindstone for the 7th book.  We can only hope...
