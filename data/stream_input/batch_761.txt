B0002EQ7EC|5.0|This is the last great album from Paul Simon.  Oh, how I wish he had more music to give to the world. After Graceland and this South American piece, I'm surprised he didn't explore other national sounds.  I miss you Paul!
1423339851|3.0|We love the Jack Reacher books but this one was not, in our opinion, as good as the others.  It is very long, so if you have a long road trip it will keep you interested along the way, but not riviting.  We give it a 3 1/2 stars.
B000MR9D5E|5.0|Every one in my family just loved it.  Great picture, great sound, its definately one of the best things i've seen on tv. I think its also a reminder to all humans that the earth doesn't just belong to us. Its a home to all sentient beings. :)

B00006I53S|5.0|You get a good sharp looking picture. I am using it with a 40D and the pictures are outstanding. I have taken potraits and the colors are sharp. I had my initial problems of pictures being soft at the further end, but I guess once I had the ISO changed, the pictures were great. You do not get a very wide angle at 28, the IS and USM is a big plus. But at 135 mm IS is not a big advantage.
B000RJO58M|3.0|I purchased this after reading all the rave reviews, when we finished watching it, my wife and I looked at each other and said 'what the?!'  A weird blend of 'Mid Summer Murders meets Rambo'.  It had a few laughs, ex video and audio qualities, but the storyline is bizarre, it was OK, but it's not the sort of movie I would be in any hurry to watch again.
B00003JRCQ|5.0|For those who are tired of the liberties taken in the production of Jane Austen movies, this version of Persuasion is, in my opinion, a movie that adheres most closely to the original text of the book. Even the characters match the descriptions used by Austen! Gone is the tendency of film directors to infuse a timeless piece of literature with modern notions of love and passion. Austen's sense of humor is preserved and delightfully portrayed.    Watch as Anne Eliot blooms when placed in social situations where her true nature is revealed. See Captain Wentworth transform from an unpardoning jilted lover to a man captivated by the love he still feels in his heart. Gain an understanding of a culture that is challenged in a switch from social hierarchy to social equality. This is Jane Austen at her best, and this movie is faithful to her literary genius!
B00005JPNZ|5.0|I have wait a lot for this movie. The teaser trailer is awesome!!. Harrison Ford looks amazing, Karen Allen is back as Marion Ravenwood, Cate Blanchett will be a great villian as Agent Irina Spalko. George Lucas strikes back since Revenge of the Sith, and Steven Spielberg, and John Williams...!!. This movie will be great. No doubt.

B000RF7XZI|4.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this movie, not the typical modern day flashy movie, but an epic with a great story line.  Visually spectacular, I was engrossed from the outset, well worth watching.
B0018M6J90|5.0|Every few years a film comes along that makes you believe in love again. Before this it was The Notebook, Titanic, etc., all the way back to Casablanca and Gone with the Wind. 'Miss Pettigrew' is the newest addition to that list.    In London, between the World Wars, we meet Guinevere Pettigrew: a poor, hungry nanny who can't hold down a job for one reason or another and is thrown out onto the street with no home and nothing but the clothes on her back. After being denied the chance to get another job by the placement agency, Miss Pettigrew steals an open slot to work for the beautiful, ravishing, and, err, popular Delysia Lafosse. It's from here that the 'Day' begins and Miss Pettigrew is thrown into a backwards world of false love, used only to get what you want. After saving Delysia from her confused private life, Guinevere is madeover into a more presentable woman to be around town with Miss Lafosse, keeping Delysia's life situated between the three men in her life: Nick (with the flat), Phil (with the stage), and Michael (with the love).    The film is probably one of the most important romantic comedies I've ever seen, coming at a time when much of the world is facing war themselves. It delivers many powerful messages. . . value each day, love is most important, etc. But, the messages aren't thrown in your face to the point of insult.    I cannot recommend this film enough and if you have the means, be sure to see it. . . and, even better, see it with someone you love.    Final Verdict: 10/10. The film itself is probably a 9/10, but it's the feeling it gave me that raises it to a 10.    \\"We're going to war, aren't we?\\"  \\"Yes we are, and that's why me mustn'twaste a moment of this precious life.\\"     -AP3-
B000QEIOTO|4.0|Seen it many times over the years now, very good entertainment. Fast and furious non stop action, much more believable than James Bond.   Loved the HD DVD extras, what a shame HD DVD is dead, HD DVD  is a quality experience and priced right, unfortunately the consumer friendly HD format lost the format war and we are now stuck with a much more expensive, less specified blu ray product, pity.
B000OMD4BG|5.0|What an awesome album of mutli-layered guitars and vocals, just the way Smith's used to excel at.  Listening to it, I kind of doubted during a minute that he actually was dead. I laughed to myself imagining for a moment that this story was a joke and that he was there somewhere still recording albums.  Well, it's not the case.  But luckily enough we still have something to discover about Elliott Smith's music. And it's one of the most beautiful piece of it. Love it, share it.
B000I2JKFG|3.0|After reading some other reviews I thought I must have missed something, maybe I fell asleep!  A weird movie, as someone else wrote, \\" A blending of Zorro, The Phantom of the Opera and 1984\\", a great description, or maybe \\"Zorro meets Batman\\".  I love mystery, intrigue and a complex plot, but this is so over the top it is silly, a bizarre movie that over promises and under delivers.    I would like to 're rate' this movie down to 2 stars at best, it really is a waste of 2 hours and the theme that terrorism is OK if it's on your side is sick!
0316789704|5.0|I discovered Ed Emberley in 2nd grade.  I had always loved to draw and had some reasonable ability (after all I ended up going to art school and getting an MFA and teaching art in college...).  What these books by Ed Emberley have to offer is a way of seeing, of breaking down complicated shapes into simple objects, and being able to put simple shapes and lines together into a complex unit.  Which is an important visual skill for anyone.    Through simple and clear step by step instructions, he demonstrates how to create a wide variety of characters and personalities, which gives younger children access to a sense of satisfaction.  I recall the real sense of pride having made some of these figures.  He also shows (though I do not remember if it is in this, all or only some books of his) how to change up the figures and invent your won, which is very important.  Yes, the names are hokey and it has its limits, but showing children success does really help.  And to be honest, when my son wanted a pirate ship, MFA aside, I picked up the purple book (another of his books) to the pirates' page.
0307383415|4.0|I read this book during the weekend my youngest sister got married.  His search for his identity, while familiar to anyone who had gone through adolescence, resonated with me as a person whose own narrative is not the neat ethnic line, strong family ties type.  He eloquently described his continuing struggle to prove himself black, while equivocating on his drive and acheivements.  I felt like I got to know him in a way we rarely do a political candidate.  Since it was written before he ever ran for public office, it is spin-free (unless you believe those that say he played up his drug use for \\"street cred\\").      This is a story of someone who felt himself an outsider in a any group he \\"belonged\\" too.  If you have any variation in your background, you will enjoy this book too.

B000V6BE6M|5.0|This is amazing! Hours of listening pleasure to finish off the collection. Surprisingly a lot of tracks sound much better than in the movie especially tracks supporting the battle scenes.     Where as The Two Towers incidental music tended to be slightly tiresome, this score keeps you engaged in every track and you notice more and more themes interwoven from the previous scores with each listen.     A must buy for a LOTR fan!
B00005AREQ|5.0|In an interview back in early 1975, Jimmy Page was raving about a new album coming out by his old friend, JEFF BECK. That was nice because fans were disappointed in 1974 by Jeff's BECK, BOGERT, & APPICE II album, which was never officially released to this day, for whatever reasons. As for BLOW BY BLOW, we knew it was coming, but we weren't expecting anything like this! An all-instrumental album, which featured Jeff's reunion with the badly missed Max Middleton, and being produced by the legendary George Martin, it was a big hit. At this time, Jeff was playing in top form, (not yet being overcome by \\"sound effects\\" he did later). It's his best guitar playing since his ROUGH AND READY (1971) days. Of course, some people didn't like it because it wasn't mainstream Heavy Rock, but truthfully by 1975, that style was worn out. Jeff's blend of Rock-Jazz fusion and funk appealed to a wide audience, certainly.

1592332803|4.0|This book has lots of creative ideas.  I have baked many of the recipes.  A word of caution.  Some of the recipes seem like they are written by someone else.  Also several of the recipes have to be tweaked.  By this I mean, directions are either unclear or down right poor.  Example, I made the cinnamon rolls, in the directions it tells you to use a baking sheet...I did this and ended up with rolls and sticky filling on the bottom of my oven.  I think the concepts are great, but some of them seem like maybe she hasn't actually put them to use herself.  I have just modified them when I need to.  While the book certainly is 'pretty', as an end user I could care less as long as the recipes result in some success.  You can find many of these recipes on line for free with more clear directions.  I think she had a good idea, i bought the book, but I think maybe actually making all of the recipes and making directions more clear is more important than pretty pictures.  if I could have given this a 3 1/2 stars I would have.  try [...]
0345442970|5.0|One of the main aspects that I thoroughly enjoyed while reading James Luceno's 'Cloak of Deception' was his political intrigue.  While the novel is not solely a biography on Palpatine, Luceno does a fantastic job of extrapolating the character from the dialogue and scenes presented in 'The Phantom Menace'. The book satisfies many of the observed shortcomings of Episode I, in that it explains the backstory of the Trade Federations reasons for the blockade of Naboo. Luceno balances the book well by switching between politics and action, the latter focusing on the Jedi and specifically Qui-Gon and Obi-Wan's pursuit of Nebula Front Captain, Cohl.     The Episode II tidbit's sprinkled through the book are a great tie-in the forthcoming film, as were the other little nods to continuity, such as cameo's by Jorus C'Baoth, Sate Pestage and Kinman Doriana, Tarkin and Vergere.     Lastly, George Lucas stated that one of his main reasons for doing the prequel trilogy was to change our perception of the classic trilogy, once we have the full picture in view. I believe that the prequel books have started to help this change in view, especially when Tarkin says in ANH that the Emperor has disbanded the Senate. We are starting to realise how powerful that line of dialogue is, because we are being shown how important a role the Senate played in the life and politics of the Old Republic. The Senate is diverse with alien representation and ideological views, but we will gradually see a transformation to the bigotry of the Empire.
B0010V4TZU|2.0|What is trendy? It's the latest, greatest, big thing.  A few years from now, though, you look back (or in this case, listen), and it's just not that great.    These guys are riding a huge wave of hype right now, which is great for them.  I really tried to give them a chance.  I listened again and again, but in the end, it's recycled Talking Heads and Paul Simon.    VW's music is OK on the surface, but there's just not much meat on the bones here.  To all the diehard fans, I ask: Are you familiar with Talking Heads' and Paul Simon's catalogs? If you answer yes, and still enjoy VW, we have a respectful difference in opinion.  If you answer no, then dig into these catalogs, and tell me who's the real deal, and who are the posers.    From those who understand what I'm getting at, I'm counting on getting some helpful votes for this review.  To those who don't, well, I'd be willing to bet they're among the crowd who aren't familiar with Talkng Heads and Paul Simon.
B000069HZP|5.0|THE GAME is another wonderful Michael Douglas film and I rate it at 5 stars. This film will really be appreciated by fans that enjoy dissecting a complex plot. The story, although hard to swallow and farfetched, was exceptionally engaging and kept my interest from start to finish. I thought on my first viewing that this film would have a sequel, but was proven wrong by events.<br /><br />THE FOLLOWING INFORMATION COULD RUIN ENJOYMENT OF THE PLOT:<br /><br />Nicholas Van Orton played by Michael Douglas is a wealthy banker, but a loner who even spends his birthday away from people. In the year of his 48th birthday (the age his father committed suicide and on the verge of classic mid-life crisis) his distant brother gives Nicholas a card giving him entry to unusual entertainment provided by something called Consumer Recreation Services (CRS). Giving in to curiosity, Nicholas visits CRS and all kinds of weird things start to happen to him. Prior to admitting him to participate he is required to take a series of mental and physical tests which were apparently run to determine his strengths, weaknesses, and perhaps map out some sort of efficient \\"game plan\\" tailored just for him. One statement I remember CRS telling him is that if you don't go to THE GAME, it will come to you.<br /><br />He receives a phone call telling him that he failed the tests and is rejected by the organization. He forgets about CRS, but then overhears several people talking about \\"the game\\" and what life-changing opportunities it provides. He notices several such \\"loud\\" conversations in public, and goes to the trouble of introducing himself and speaking with a couple of apparently new members of his private club. All they will tell him is they wish they were just starting \\"the game\\" and one man quotes the bible saying \\"where I was once blind I now can see\\". Once he is certain he has actually been admitted to THE GAME, he tries to return to the offices of CRS where he received his tests, only to find that no signs of their facilities remain and for all effects, this organization never even \\"existed\\".<br /><br />This initially \\"mild\\" form of harassment (i.e., being misinformed of his membership status, having drinks spilled on him in restaurants, strange people banging into him, folks behaving very strangely in rest rooms and other public places, empty toilets overflowing, his attach&eacute; case jamming at important business meetings, the pen CRS told him to keep leaking on his shirt, individuals collapsing in the street at his feet, etc.), gradually transitions to increasingly overt and often potentially life-threatening experiences which slowly work on his mental condition. All the more strange is the fact that he is provided the means of barely escaping his next experience by receiving an item or remembering a fact he learned during a prior event.  Some examples of these increasingly life threatening events include: his estate being broken into and ransacked, being stranded in a darkened elevator, his cab driver driving his CRS taxi into the river almost drowning him, large crowds of people disappearing in a coordinated way from public places, being drugged, attacked by hooded gun men emerging from a large van marked Cable Repair Services, abducted and ultimately waking up in a crypt and stranded without cash, credit cards or passport in Mexico).<br /><br />The mental harassment is designed at first to merely embarrass or make uncomfortable, mildly inconvenience, then to be serious and painful, and after enough repetition and conditioning for him to associate these strange events, to effectively torture and eventually drive insane. Since almost every detail is staged redundantly there are no correct decisions left for him to make, and no avoiding the sequence of painful situations. He is ultimately like a caged animal walking wall to wall in a classic avoidance-avoidance conflict leading to insanity.  The issue of the cost-effectiveness of this game plan issomething the film never addresses, but we are too engrossed to think about this during the movie.<br /><br />One thing is certain, these people do not want to publicly kill him or leave any permanent record of injury due to anything other than a random event. The purpose of THE GAME seems not to be simple murder, but to professionally destroy, discredit and cause a very gradual physical and mental breakdown which will result in his being either jailed because of acting out displaced aggressions, hospitalized or institutionalized where he can \\"die\\" or be subjected to something while well out of public scrutiny.<br /><br />In his former professional life he could certainly have made enemies, and what better means could they use to destroy him with impunity? While his financial and mental conditions still enable him to investigate CRS, he believes he acquires \\"evidence\\" that one of the office workers at CRS was a hired professional actor, more likely to have been provided by Actors Equity than some private detective or intelligence agency (CIA?). As the story unfolds this evidence was probably \\"fed\\" to him as part of the plot which is just full of strange twists and complications, all leading him no place.<br /><br />His entire personality changes as he undergoes transformation from a strong business-world predator to the cowering subject of physical and mental harassment. It is sad but interesting to watch his gradual disintegration as forces outside of his control consume him. The ending was a bit strange and is the reason I thought there would be a sequel.<br /><br />IF THE ABOVE MATERIAL CAN RUIN THE ENDING THE FOLLOWING IS WORSE:<br /><br />The film can only be said to have a rediculous ending when Van Orton confronts his brother who he now believes is in on the game plan on the roof of the CRS building.  At the end of the story after Van Orton believes he has shot his brother he actually jumps off the roof of the high rise CRS building intent on suicide because of his grief.  He is surprised to learn after smashing through the break away glass of a fake skylight, that he safely lands on a huge airbag carefully placed to break his tremendous fall.  He then sees his resurrected brother and all the other people dressed up in black tie to celebrate his birthday.  It was, after all, just a \\"harmless\\" gag.<br /><br />At the end of the story there are no hard feelings and all gracious smiles as he is presented with the check for the elaborate hoaxes that CRS has staged for his \\"entertainment\\". Even though he has probably aged over 30 years as a result of continuous mental trauma in just a number of days, he goes from table to table thanking the guests for making it a very special party. He even asks out the very beautiful and treacherous lady who slipped him a mickey during the ordeal. Well, the film was too entertaining for that very weak and silly ending to ruin it, but it did erode what I thought was (up until then) a very well done and thought out thriller.we are too engrossed to think about this during the movie.

B000MIVCX4|5.0|If you want a good WAAS enabled GPS reciever for a laptop, this is it. Widows Vista recognised it and set it up automatically as COM4. I downloaded the GPSinfo diagnostic utility from their website. From a cold start in my living room it had my position within 1 minute and was tracking 9 satilites within 2 minutes. From a warm start it was maybe 1 second. Unless you fly to another country or climb inside a steel water tank, by the time you boot up your computer, you will have a solid fix. As long as it isn't mounted directly to the laptop, the signal strength is excellent. The brand and website are not printed on the product, so if you forget who makes it in the future, have fun finding their website.
B0010YSD7M|3.0|I was expecting a bit more for the conclusion of the Ori story arc. Unfortunately, I was disappointed in the ending. They seemed to wrap it up too quickly. The beginning of the movie built the story up and then they pull out something that has been beaten to death in other seasons.    Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed the movie, however I was disappointed with the conclusion. I own all 10 seasons of SG-1 and the first 3 seasons of Atlantis on DVD, but somehow I think Ark of Truth could have been better.

0307387178|4.0|Chris McCandless was intelligent, likeable, dedicated, disaffected by social trappings, and estranged from his successful, but in his eyes hypocritical, father. He walked away from his family in May, 1990, never to return, upon graduating from Emory University in Atlanta, to seek a life of truth as he saw it, disdaining conventional comforts. The author starts at the end of Chris' life, when he was found dead by hunters in the heart of Alaska, in Sept, 1992, due to the starvation effects of having eaten wild potatoes that harmed his metabolic system.<br /><br />The author was able to follow Chris' two year journey to Alaska through Chris' journal entries, his photographs, and extensive interviews with those who crossed his path. Though Chris was instantly liked by the out-of-the-way souls that he met, he did not linger for long. He fearlessly jettisoned his car and his savings as being distractions and inconsistent with the experience he was seeking. His positive approach to problems and deprivations encountered is beyond remarkable.<br /><br />Beyond Chris' journey and its difficulties is the attempt to understand. Was Chris overly reckless or on a suicide mission? Chris was certainly not alone in this sort of pursuit. Other adventurers similar to Chris are briefly profiled, including the author's own nearly disastrous mountain climbing trip to Alaska. Conventional thinking can probably never understand the Chrises of the world. Few combine the need for experience, the bravery, the contempt for material goods, etc to even attempt such a journey. All we can do is appreciate it and try to understand. Maybe be thankful that the human spirit can be so great in any one person.<br /><br />By the way, the movie based on this book, is a faithful reproduction, is quite good, and worth seeing by anyone who finds the book interesting.
0316010669|2.0|I guess the thinner the slice the better the decision, so I should make decisions on no information and select leaders with the least experience.  Should have talked more about knowing when enough info is sufficient and how to identify the risks involved with making decisions rather than pushing the line that less really is more.  His sources are a bit suspect to anyone that knows them, but, with enogh salt, this book gives some points to ponder.
1852424672|1.0|I read this book after reading the Post-Birthday World, which I must say that I really enjoyed.  While the subject matter didn't intially appeal to me, I thought I'd give the book a try after reading some of the positive reviews.  However, I found this book ridiculously simplistic and generally mean-spirited.  I've unfortunately read other books from Ms. Shriver and it appears the Post-Birthday World is the only keeper.  I am tired reading about a female central character that considers herself a good cook, loves red wine, has androgenous facial features, vilifies overweight people, knows the power of a short skirt (?), uses an inflated vocabulary, and generally emits a smug self-satisfiedness that is so childish that it is laughable, were it not so pathetic.  Unfortunately, most of her work appears to me like thinly-veiled auto-biographical ax-griding.  How this won an award is beyond me.  I am so offended by this book (and a Perfectly Good Family) that I´m throwing them in the paper bin.  Perhaps they could be recycled for another more worthy use--like toilet paper.

I am sorry you had a 'disagreement' with the band. Boo freakin' Hoo.    That band MADE you.  Show the fans (who pay YOUR bills) some respect and do the 'reunion' thing. And I don't mean the \\"Led Zep\\" reunion with one or two shows. I mean a full-blown tour. Hey, if you need to bring your 'other' band along, charge us another $5 per ticket. We'll do it & more. Just don't be a dork.

B00081912E|5.0|Stanley Impkiss (Jim Carrey) was your basic bank clerk who is a nice guy but has some problems. He soon discovers a mysterious magical ancient mask by the beach as he later puts it on and changes him into a crazy green-faced cartoony being called The Mask. He does weird and amusing things as he fights crime and make people laugh including the power to romance a sexy nightclub dancer named Tina (Cameron Diaz), but mob boss Dorian Tyrell (Peter Greene) wants him dead.<br /><br />Hilarious and creative fantasy-comedy inspired by a Dark Horse Comic book ! while the original comic books were dark and violent, the filmmakers like Chuck Russell (Who did \\"Nightmare on Elm Street 3\\" and the 1988 \\"Blob\\") had to made it a little light hearted for the screen yet it worked like a charm. Cameron Diaz makes her debut in this film and made alot of men's mouths drop like the character in this picture, i like how this movie uses amazing special effects by Industrial Light and Magic to make the bizarre cartoony character's special powers and Tex Avery-esque gags come to life on the screen. Jim Carrey's physical comedy also provides good laughs as always, the film become a suprise box-office hit and one of the best comedies of the 90's! It's a must watch for the whole family.<br /><br />This DVD contains good picture and sound with some very good extras like Audio commentary, deleted scenes, Cameron Diaz screen test, three featurettes, and the trailer to this and other trailers from New Line Cinema.<br /><br />Also recommended: \\"Hellboy\\", \\"Sin City\\", \\"Superman 1 & 2\\", \\"Spider-Man Trilogy\\", \\"Batman Begins\\", \\"Who Framed Roger Rabbit\\", \\"Ichi The Killer\\", \\"Dick Tracy\\", \\"Kung-Fu Hustle\\", \\"Batman (1989)\\", \\"Batman Returns\\", \\"Beetlejuice\\", \\"Drop Dead Fred\\", \\"DarkMan\\", \\"Superman Returns\\", \\"Hulk\\", \\"The Incredibles\\", \\"Young Frankenstein\\", \\"Hot Shots!\\", \\"The Crow\\".

B000FQJAIW|5.0|Long ago in a galaxy far away, Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher) has kidnapped by the evil Darth Vader (Played by David Prowse and voiced by James Earl Jones). She sents out two special robots named C-3PO (Voiced by Anthony Daniels) and R2-D2 (Kenny Baker) to a plaet to find someone named Obi-Wan Kenobi (Sir Alec Guiness) as he is Leia's only hope. A farmboy named Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamil) somehow finds the droids then takes them to a sleazy alien bar where they meet lovable smuggler Han Solo (Harrison Ford) and furry friend Chewbacca (Peter Mayhew). They all join forces together, as they must try to rescue the princess and stop Darth Vader's sinister plan.<br /><br />What is there to say about this movie? it launched a new hope in Sci-fi and fantasy movies, it started out as an idea by George Lucas when he wrote the script, story and even created the SW universe as he wanted to sell this to Universal or United Artist. Then later, 20th Century Fox bought the rights to his movie and a year later the film was finished and had an unexpected success. The film was embraced by both audiences and critics as it as a masterpiece unlike anything they ever seen, a phenomeneon was born. The film itself offers great performances, spectacular special effects, a good storyline and non-stop entertainment all the way! The film spawned two sequels, three prequels, neverending merchandise, imitators, video games, toys and other cool stuff.<br /><br />This DVD has for the very first time the classic first movie in it's original un-special edition version with some of the stuff that was left out from the 1997 special edition re-issue such as the werewolf-esque creatures, no Jabba the Hut, and of course the purist's fans much loved scene where Han shoots first. This also included the 1997 special edition, the picture on both movies are nicely remastered and this is guaraneteed to satisfy SW fans who brought the trilogy on DVD in it's boxset.
0743270754|5.0|Doris Kearns Goodwin succeeds in bringing to life several important men of the mid 19th century and shows how they shaped the America of the next century.  I am not a lover of Lincoln and believed that he acted beyond the power of the presidency in sending troops to bring the southern states back under his control.  Kearns captures the ethos of the Civil War period and makes Lincoln's actions (and those of his cabinet) understandable.
1582701709|1.0|I gave this book one star because that's the lowest rating possible; it doesn't deserve even one star! What's the secret? Positive thinking is good, negative thinking is bad. Nothing new, but repeated over and over enough times to make up a book. This author takes pop psychology down to a new level of absurdity. Did you know that we create everything with our thoughts? Even the Universe! \\"Quantum physicists tell us that the entire Universe emerged from thought!\\" Really? Which physicist said that? And how did someone exist before the Universe to think it all up? Absolutely absurd! (If you really want to learn the latest of what we know about the Universe, read Carl Sagan's recently released book, The Varieties of Scientific Experience.)And what about \\"Often when people first hear this part of the Secret they recall events in history where masses of lives were lost, and they find it incomprehensible that so many people could have attracted themselves to the event. It doesn't necessarily mean they thought of the exact event, but the frequency of their thoughts matched the frequency of the event.\\" So, all the many millions of people who were killed during and after WWII were just thinking at the wrong frequency? Also those killed on 9/11? Ditto for the millions of Africans who were kidnapped and forced into lifetimes and generations of slavery? Absolute nonsense! But don't worry if you've been thinking negative thoughts, because \\"...an affirmative thought is hundreds of times more powerful than a negative thought. That eliminates a degree of worry right there.\\" How many hundreds of times? She doesn't say, even though \\"We can measure a thought.\\" How? Doesn't say. If you're looking for logic, you won't find it in this book. If you want help with changing your thoughts, try Silva Mind Control, or Dr. David Burns's Feeling Good book, or learn how to meditate. If you think that you must have this book, at least read the first 20 pages before you spend the money.
B000MRAAJM|5.0|I just bought the series.  I'm watching disc 1, and feel awed by the beauty and wonder.  Of course, I thought of my 3 and 4 year old nephew and niece.  I'm sure they would delight in the images, especially the images of baby animals with their mothers.  They would love the mountains and the snow.  I even thought I would buy a globe for them, so that I could show them the regions covered in the film.  There is a big problem, however, which is that the film shows some animals attacking and eating other animals.  Yes, I know that animals are not all vegetarian.  But my niece and nephew do not hear about killing yet.  They are too young to contemplate such things, but not too young to marvel at the exquisite detailed view of the natural environment in far-away places where no humans live.  They are not too young to begin to understand the value of undisturbed habitat.  I just wish there were an alternate, no-kill, sanitized version.  Kids today watch a lot of dvds full of Disney steoro-typed images and cartoons, etc.  So, don't tell me children under 5 should not watch dvds.

B0002234LS|3.0|I used to love reading Stephen King novels. Then somewhere along the way, it seemed to me that he got too caught up in his own hype. Rather than tell a story that kept me captivated, he began to lengthen the stories by adding so much detail that I found I didn't care after so many pages. That being said, I never read the story that this movie was based on. And after having watched it, I am glad that I didn't.    Johnny Depp plays Mort Rainey, a writer of mysteries who begins the movie confronting his wife Amy (Maria Bello) in bed with her lover Ted (Timothy Hutton) at the local motel. Fast forward six months and we find Mort asleep in his cabin by the lake. With writer's block setting in, Mort is confronted one morning by a tall country bumpkin who calls himself John Shooter (John Turturro).     Shooter accuses Rainey of stealing his story, one called THE SECRET WINDOW. And now he wants Rainey to give it back to him with full credit. Rainey argues with him and turns his back on Shooter. But when he leaves, Mort opens the door to find Shooter's manuscript on the porch. In reading it, he finds that the story is almost identical, word for word, to the one he had written years before.    Another face off between the two comes the following day. When Mort asks Shooter when he wrote his story, he informs him that that date was two years after the story was published. Shooter offers him a chance to prove him wrong by presenting him a copy of the book within the next three days. Mort later finds his dog killed, a screwdriver sticking out of him, proof from Shooter that he means business.    Contacting the local police against Shooter's written command, Mort finds little help. When he talks to his soon to be ex-wife, he ends up doing nothing but regurgitating old arguments and opening old wounds.  Mort turns to a private detective (Charles Dutton) he has used before when he dealt with a rabid fan of his novels. Dutton agrees to look into it as well as the cabin.     Mort iscontacted again and again by Shooter, who makes a point of never being seen. And with each visit, Mort is set on edge, wondering if anything will get this man off of his back and out of his life. When his wife's house is burned to the ground, the house where he had a copy of the magazine the story was published in, he begins to wonder if even offering the proof will stop Shooter.    There is more going on here than meets the eye. Subtle hints of the real story are strewn throughout, giving clues as to the real person behind it all and the motivations as well. Fans of mysteries will catch these early on while everyone else will be left wondering. Perhaps I have seen too many films and read too many novels, but I knew who was behind it all within the first 15 minutes of the film. And this was what made it a bad movie for me.    A mystery should keep the viewer held captive in their seat as they try to solve the riddle posed to them. The amazing thing to me about this movie was that not only was I able to figure it out, I felt that I had seen a number of stories based around this theme time and time again. I was stunned that a story about plagiarism actually felt like a plagiarized story. I don't know where, but I have seen this tale before.     The movie itself was well made and enjoyable to watch. Depp has proven that he is more than just a pretty face, although that is more than enough for fans like my wife. The sign of a good actor is one who can make you believe that they are the character and not an actor portraying one. Depp has that ability.    For those who aren't jaded by seeing too many filmed mysteries or having reads too many, this movie will provide you with a nice evening out. But for fans of the genre, it will result in watching and waiting for the revelation to come out knowing the answer well in advance.

B00008EYA5|4.0|Tons of movies are being made today based on television shows from the recent past. Well, at least it's recent to me.  CHARLIES ANGELS, MCHALES NAVY, SGT. BILKO and more have made the transfer over the past few years. And there are more on the way. But for now, let's look at S.W.A.T.    The old show had a hardened veteran in Steve Forest as Hondo, leading an elite team of police officers into harms way, solving situations that regular officers couldn't handle on their own. The group became known and the fans began to love each of their favorite S.W.A.T. team member.     This movie does the same thing, with one exception. Gone are the days when police officers were respected and well liked. They have been replaced with images of police beating men brutally and without mercy. They have been made out to be the bad guys more than the bad guys by the press. And with that in mind, we begin to understand the theme here, the underlying current laid out by the Capt. Fuller (Larry Poindexter). They need a team that is special, that can get the job done, but also a team that can garner the respect and admiration of the whole city.    The main story revolves around an S.W.A.T. member, or ex member, named Jim Street (Colin Farrell). When his partner goes down for disobeying orders and getting a hostage shot, Street stays on the force, being subjected to the lowest duty possible for a man of action, taking care of the cage. There, he cleans boots, checks out guns and waits for the day he'll get a chance to prove himself once more. Had he turned on his partner, he would have walked and stayed with the team. But now....this.    Six months pass and a new team is being assembled. Brought in to shake things up and train the team is Sgt. Dan \\"Hondo\\" Harrelson (Samuel L. Jackson). A veteran of the original teams in their beginning, Hondo is brought back to whip into shape a new team, the team that they are looking for to not only get the job done, but to look good doing it.     Hondo recruits his own team, putting his reputation and job on the line for them, and sets out to train his team. Included are L.L.Cool Jay, Josh Charles, Michelle Rodriquez, Brain Van Holt and Farrell. Hondo does get the team up and running and it doesn't take long for them to see action, as does the audience.     A converging storyline follows a foreign mobster who has been arrested for a broken tail light. Once recognized, he is about to be escorted to prison. Along his walk into the jail, with the assistance of the ever anxious press, he calls out that he will give $100 million to anyone who breaks him free.  With most of the city contemplating the idea and with gang bangers looking for easy money, the attacks begin.    Does he get rescued? Does he go to prison? Does the S.W.A.T. team gel? Watch and see in this action packed film.
B000035P5E|5.0|I watched this movie for the first time recently on cable and found it so engrossing that I watched it a second time a week later -- and now I'm on amazon reading the reviews and considering whether to purchase it.  I decided to comment on Sutherland's character, the Needle, because as a relatively new psychotherapist I found myself wondering during the first half of the film whether this man was sociopathic (I have to disagree with another reviewer who said he was \\"psychotic\\") or whether he was turning off whatever feelings he might have about killing because it was what he had to do.  In other words, would this man have the capacity to kill were it not socially sanctioned and viewed as a necessity during wartime?  Arguably, he might not have killed Kate Nelligan's husband had he not confronted him about the camera film of the airplanes and not killed the lighthouse keeper if he had been able to use the wireless without being discovered.  He did not harm Kate Nelligan or her son, even when she chopped off part of his hand and fried the wireless (and he looked at her burnt fingers with a subtle compassion).  This tells me he was capable of caring, if not love.  We have hints to his adult personality, as influenced by his chiildhood, from comments he made about parents essentially using children for their needs and not really loving them (we assume he was talking about himself).  But he said it in a way that felt like he had an understanding of his childhood as opposed to a person who was simply acting out from repressed rage.  What do others think?  Is he sociopathic (anti-social personality disorder would be the diagnosis according to the current Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, the DSM-IV TR), does he have some sociopathy but not rigidified enough to call him personality disordered, or a normal guy capable of handling complex and highly stressful situations in wartime (and following through on what others need him to do, as socialized to do by his parents)?  I don't think a person suffering from unresolved childhood trauma (the fight, flight, or freeze response) would be able to hold it together and think as clearly as he was able to over an extended period of time either.

B00005JM0B|3.0|It has been said that a second movie in a series is never as good as the first and that it usually ends up being the worst. In this series, that has proven to be the opposite of what has happened. While the first film was the most imaginative, the second used that as a jumping point and added some spectacular effects and action. This movie attempts to do the same and fails.<br /><br />For those who have been cave dwellers for a while, the terminator is a robot from the future sent back in time to kill John Connors, the man who will one day lead a rebel revolt against the machines of the future. So much for movie one.<br /><br />Movie two had a second more advanced robot come back to kill Connors but also a copy of the original robot come back programmed by Connors to save himself. Movie two.<br /><br />This time around, Connor's mother has passed away and he is on his own, trying to do his best not to get caught up in anything that might change the future and result in his having to be the savior of the world. Yeah, like that's gonna happen.<br /><br />A new terminator, the T-X (Kristanna Loken) is sent back in time by the robots of the future to destroy not only John Connors (this time portrayed by Nick Stahl) but those who will become his staff as well when the final battle comes. The T-X gets a good start on this killing off a few when she encounters John along with one time friend Kate Brewster (Claire Danes). With two for the price of one in her sights, she attacks.<br /><br />Too bad that Connors sent back another terminator to prevent this from happening. Yes, it's the old model played by Arnold Schwarzenegger that comes to help. But he is obviously no match for the updated model sent to kill and destroy.<br /><br />As Connors and Brewster get reacquainted with one another while on the run, the Hollywood stuntman's association garners a major paycheck as tons of automobiles are blown to bits and stunt men dresses as Arnold are slammed through various buildings. This movie is more about action and explosions than any real science fiction.<br /><br />No one wonders why it is that robots keep being sent back which means that the future never changed after all. If it had, why are they here now? And the reason they came about explained in the second film is given little validity if there is another way that the future could have yielded these monstrous machines.<br /><br />The acing is...well....who really knows since acting is not the reason to watch this movie. It does look well made, I'll give it credit for that. But it is one of the most hollow films I have seen I a long time. While I cared about Connors as well as his robot protector in the second film, I found myself not giving a hoot for anyone here. Rather than being thrilled and awed, I was bored.<br /><br />A sequel, to be a good one, should cover new ground and take us somewhere just a little bit different. This movie is a rehash of the last one without new dazzling effects or enough emotion to ring us in. It substitutes roaring explosions for the matters of the heart that made us enjoy the last film.<br /><br />One had to hope that with this film the franchise would die. But it didn't as the release of the new television series proved. Even the surprise ending was one that didn't really matter much by the time it was revealed.

B0002WZTOI|1.0|Long story short, this DVD is not a true widescreen version.  In fact, it is far from it.  I have the fullscreen version of this movie, and was able to compare scenes.  Obviously, the fullscreen version I have is a cropped version of the original film.  It is clear that this \\"special widescreen edition\\" is a further cropped version of the fullscreen version.  Thus, they cut the sides off of the original film to make the full screen version, and then cut the top and bottom off of the fullscreen version to make it into this \\"widescreen\\" version.      Trust me, you don't want this DVD - it's like watching the film in a movie theatre when you are about 3 feet from the screen.  The top of everyone's head is constantly cut off, and the images are noticeably grainy due to being so heavily zoomed.  I suggest looking for an old version of the DVD (it has a different cover).  By the way, the old version actually has both fullscreen and the same kind of concocted \\"widescreen\\" on the same disc - so it's even a better deal if you want to watch the so-called \\"widescreen\\" version.
B00005JMUA|4.0|I loved the movie KILL BILL VOLUME 1. I thought it was not only a great tribute to the films that director Quentin Tarantino loved seeing in those grind houses long ago, but a fantastic action film in its own right. And now the final chapter in the story (so far), the second film reaches screens around the world. And...it is different.<br /><br />Suffice to say that if you walk into this film expecting the first, you will be terribly disappointed. The gore fest bloodshed has toned down, the massive amounts of swordplay, gone. Instead we find a more philosophical Tarantino film, a movie more about wordplay than swordplay. And while taken aback by it at first, I found that the more I thought about it the better it was.<br /><br />Having finished off the first two targets on her list, The Bride (as Uma Thurman's character is known so far) sets out to finish the job she started. The film opens with her making this statement and then flashing back in this chapter to what brought it all about, the massacre that we witnessed in the first film and why it came to be.<br /><br />We discover that she was the love of Bill's (David Carradine) life and that he was torn apart by her leaving him. So much so that he made the decision that if he couldn't have her no one could. He refused to let her leave the ranks of the assassination squad he had formed. At least we think this for now.<br /><br />With each chapter we are given more information as we discover who it was that trained the Bride. It was Bill's former master, Wei Ping (Gordon Liu). He takes on the task of training the Bride, something that comes in handy later on when she finds herself buried alive by Bud (Michael Madsen) after she attacks him.<br /><br />Bud, who we discover is Bill's brother, is down on his luck, working as a bouncer in a low class strip joint in El Paso. Having spoken with Bill already, he is waiting for Uma. Thinking he has done her in, he contacts Elle (Daryl Hannah) to sell of her sword. But Elle has different plans for Bud. And Uma has plans for her.<br /><br />A face off between Elle (Daryl Hannah) and the bride occurs in Bud's trailer. The swords fly and the movements are swift while confined to the small space of the trailer. But a winner emerges. By death? We are left to figure that out on our own.<br /><br />And finally, Uma heads out for a contact that will put her in touch with Bill. The final confrontation, begun with the release of the first film, unfolds. Not only that, but the surprise that Bill has in store for Uma as well. And as the surprises are revealed, conversation between these two combatants unfold the entire story that we have only been given portions of to date.<br /><br />Tarantino took much flack with the first film in that the dialogue that he is noted for was kept to a minimum while the action took the forefront. Critics blasted him for this. He has stated that the film wasn't complete with that one and keeping that in mind while watching makes the film a better experience for the viewer. When he finished, he realized that he could not release the entire picture without it being a 4 hour opus. Instead, he cut it in two and released the stories separately making them unite as a whole.  Keep this in mind while watching and it makes a difference.<br /><br />The acting in this film is wonderful, especially from David Carradine. Though never quite a fan of his, he does a great job here as Bill, offering his philosophies on life and love and the results of the same. Michael Madsen is underused but does a great job with what little time he has onscreen. And Hannah makes one of the meanest villains on screen in some time.<br /><br />But the role of the Bride (whose name is revealed finally....but don't expect me to give it here) as played by Thurman is what makes this film. It is not only the emotions that she must convey, but the physical aspects of it and delivery of dialogue in a way that makes it all believable. And Thurman does each one of these with an ease never seen before.<br /><br />KILL BILL VOLUME 2 is a good movie and an entertaining experience. See part one on DVD before watching this though and take it in as a whole film. Those who do will find more rewards than those who see it as two different films.ovie and an entertaining experience.

0767827902|5.0|A black and white portrait of a dying Texas town complete with tired businessman, bored wife, all the problems of adolescence in a place where nothing goes on.  The spectrum of life from young man/woman hood to adults trying to make meaning of life (and concluding that adultery is the only way), to a whole used-up life expiring, is brilliantly portrayed with obliterating dust, emptiness, banging screen doors. The lack of color is as it should be. The only \\"color\\" in their lives is a saucy waitress who dishes out the sustenance of life, on plates and verbally. Superb direction, fresh acting, perfect casting.  The entire action is summed up by a mute teenager who is \\"taken care of\\" by the town.  This boy \\"sweeps up\\" the town as his way of returning care.  He, too, is eliminated, by lack of understanding, by lack of sensitivity.  Brilliant, memorable film.
B00028HBKM|5.0|THE PASSION OF THE CHRIST is perhaps the most talked about movie in the history of film. Other films have been condemned, discussed, dissected and more. But this film has received more anger ridden controversy than the last movie about Christ to do so, THE LAST TEMPTATION OF CHRIST. And is the controversy worth noting? Perhaps. But some of it is nothing more than the rants of people who never saw the film. The film does deserve to be seen and discussed.<br /><br />For anyone living in a cave over the past few years, the movie focuses on the last day in the life of Jesus Christ (Jim Caviezel). It opens with his praying on his last night in the garden and moves quickly forward to his betrayal by Judas and subsequent torture and persecution by anyone with power at the time.<br /><br />A sect of Jews led by Caiphas found Jesus to be a threat to their power base. In response, they set out to have him destroyed. More than destroying his following, they actually wanted him wiped off of the face of the Earth. And they set out to do so. This has caused some to consider the film anti-Semitic. The fact of the matter was there were two choices of the people involved to crucify Christ at that time: the Jewish leaders or the Roman leaders. History has shown that it was the Jewish leaders that called for his demise. Plus the fact is that Jesus himself was a Jew. It is not anti-Semitic to state this. It is merely history. And for those who believe, there was no other option for those leaders if God's plan was to be followed through.<br /><br />The movie proceeds to show the physical persecution of Jesus from there forward. When he is arrested and transported to the temple, he is beaten with the chains that bind him. When he is in the temple and accused, he is beaten by the mob. All of this is disturbing in its own right. But things get progressively worse.<br /><br />Taken to Pilate so that he might put Jesus to death, Pilate opts for the political ploy of sending him to Herod, the king of Jesus land of birth, to judge him. Herod sends him back. Pilate caves but not completely, ordering Jesus to be punished but not put to death. And this is where the truly brutal point of the film begins.<br /><br />Jesus is taken to the guards for scourging. For those who do not know, this is when Jesus was beaten. Many times we have heard about Jesus being whipped, lashed or beaten. But never has it been this graphically portrayed. The guards taunt Jesus and are presented as sadistic oafs. They begin with reed like canes and when that doesn't offer enough damage, when Jesus continues to rise, they switch to a cat-o-nine tails type whip, tipped with pieces of glass. These cut into Jesus' flesh, ripping him apart like so much meat. When finished, the stones surrounding Jesus are covered in blood.<br /><br />Throughout the grueling punishment that Jesus receives, his mother Mary is witness. She sees the torturous treatment that her son receives. She sees the pain and anguish he is going through. And she conveys on her face the pain that she is suffering along with him.<br /><br />Near death, Jesus is once again taken to Pilate. Still unwilling to condemn this man to death, he turns the matter over to the people who call out for his demise. Broken and bloodied, Jesus is forced to carry his own cross to be crucified on. Shredded beyond belief, he does so, faltering several times along the way, at one point requiring assistance.<br /><br />The final act of the film offers perhaps the most realistic glimpse of what those who were crucified had to endure. It is painful to watch. Director Mel Gibson never lets go of the viewer's throat, forcing you to witness the pain that Jesus, Gibson's representation of God on Earth, went through. And it leaves you wasted by the film's end.<br /><br />There is no way that a person of faith, a person who believes in God and Jesus can walk away from this film untouched. The images are seared into your mind. Although I do not attendchurch, I believe in God and Jesus. And as I watched, beginning with the scourging, I found myself crying. Sure I had heard that people were doing this. I was prepared to control myself while watching. But as the film progressed, I cried several times, unable to stop and never feeling ashamed of it. This movie can affect you as strongly as this.<br /><br />From a technical standpoint, the movie is very well made. The photography is well done, the story told plainly and simply and the direction done so as to not make you notice. It was Gibson's passion with his belief in Christ that made this film a reality. He has taken much heat from the Hollywood community for bringing his vision to life. It has been said that he may never work in Hollywood again. If that were possible, it would be their loss, not his.<br /><br />The movie opened big, making more money than anyone could ever have expected by a movie of this sort of topic. It caused more discussion of religion and belief than any movie that I can ever recall. And perhaps, even though he has suffered the slings and arrows of an impartial press and industry, perhaps it was worth it. Because at the end of the day, Gibson was able to make people think once again about God. And that is an accomplishment in itself.<br /><br />I highly recommend that everyone see this film. It will touch you no matter what you believe. If it doesn't, then you have no feelings inside.h the scourging, I found myself crying. Sure I had heard that people were doing this.

B00005JMEW|5.0|I know that title may not mean much since this is only Tarantino's fourth full feature. But this is a movie that leaves you wanting more. Granted that will happen with the release of part two. But until that time, fans will have to salivate over this portion.<br /><br />The story: a lady know only here as \\"the Bride\\" (Uma Thurman) is nearly beaten to death at her wedding. She is then shot in the head at point blank range by Bill (an unseen David Carradine). She goes into a coma for four years and awakes to find a hospital attendant has been offering her \\"services\\" to anyone willing to pay. She takes out the current customer and the attendant and tries to leave.<br /><br />Flashbacks tell the tale here of how she was part of an assassination squad, the deadliest ever assembled. When she tried to leave, they took her out instead. On her wedding day. While she was pregnant.<br /><br />Now awake from her coma, she has plans for revenge. The film opens with her attack on what seems like a normal soccer mom (Vivica A. Fox). The two spar back and forth using what they come across as weapons, ending with knives. When Fox' little girl comes home, they pause to set up a time and date to finish. Then...well I won't blow that for you.<br /><br />Flashback again as we see the Bride heading to Okinawa. There, she has a sword crafted for her by the best maker alive (Sonny Chiba). He's stopped making them but when he learns of her intentions for this one, especially since Bill was his prot&eacute;g&eacute; at one time, he makes her the best sword possible.<br /><br />Sword in hand, she head to Tokyo and the first person on her list: O-Ren Ishi (Lucy Lui). We are treated to an anime tale of how she came to rise from a little girl who watched her parents murdered to an assassin to the head of the Japanese Yakuza. She will not be someone that the Bride will take out with ease.<br /><br />The confrontation takes place in a Japanese night spot. Not only does the Bride have to face off against Lui, she must first take on the gang she leads, her own group of sword wielding assassins. If she can get past them, she faces O-Ren's personal bodyguards. And finally, she will face off against O-Ren herself.<br /><br />What happens to this point, and I am sure you can guess the outcome, ends the picture. Almost. A special cliff hanger is dropped on the viewer just before the credits role and the anticipation of seeing part two explodes.<br /><br />This movie is Tarantino's tribute to the movies he learned to love visiting what he calls \\"grindhouses\\", those cheap low scale theaters that were full of unsavory characters in attendance and needed hosed down with bug spray almost nightly. Tarantino grew to love these movies in their environment and while working in a video store. His love of these movies, everything from spaghetti westerns to samurai films, is apparent in most of his movies, but never as much as it is here. This movie is an homage to those films.<br /><br />The action in this film fills the screen more than not. The blood in this film flows bright red and fluidly, so much so that even though it appears fake it still elicited oohs and aahs from the crowd I saw it with. Everything from splitting a man in two to decapitations to mutilations is on view here, reminding me of movies like SHOGUN ASSASSIN. And it should.

B000UBMSB8|5.0|This set contains a disk with three other versions including the original release.  The main version is brighter with improved audio levels and sharper visual effects.    It's so much improved over the directors cut I bought two one for my sister one for myself.
B0001HLVS2|4.0|While most movies depicting the rigors of war and battle these days focus on either the glory of heroism or the gore of wounds inflicted, MASTER AND COMMANDER focuses instead on a more realistic aspect. That is to say it combines both of these depictions of war, never truly making one or the other seem the way it was. And I believe that that is what it would actually boil down to; a combination of the physical and emotional scars of war as well as the admiration of men of courage.<br /><br />The story takes place in 1805 during the Napoleonic wars. Captain Jack Aubrey (Russell Crowe) is in command of the H.M.S. Surprise with instructions to ferret out the Acheron, a French ship that has been wreaking havoc off the coast of South America. With a hardy crew and a combination of battle scarred and fresh faced officers, they set out to do the task they were assigned.<br /><br />But rather than wait till half way through the film to have these two adversaries confront one another, the film nearly opens with a full blown sea battle. But this one is unlike most offered in films from the past. The glowing heroics of jumping from ship to ship, the always missing cannonballs, the smiling faces are replaced with a more realistic atmosphere.<br /><br />The Surprise is caught off guard and pelted with cannon fire, ripping the ship apart. The battle is not so much fought using guns and swords as it is using tactics and maneuvering. A combination of these two (as well as the fog bank from which the Acheron was able to launch its attack) and the ship and crew are saved. Broken but not yet destroyed, Aubrey and his crew set out to find the Acheron while making repairs as they go.<br /><br />With this adrenaline rush completed for the viewer, we are now offered a glimpse into the real life that was found at sea. The daily routine of making sure the ship was taken care of, the talking between the ships crew that eventually leads to the death of one of the officers, the camaraderie of the crew who would follow their captain to hell and back and yet would never consider sharing more than a cursory glance at the officers. These were two separate classes brought together for a common cause, but that never made them friends.<br /><br />And yet when a kind word or situation presents itself, it is offered. The deeds and misdeeds of those on board bring about a closeness between this group and they rise to the task before them.<br /><br />Not only does this story present itself (more in visual deed than in word), the observations of the ship's doctor, Dr. Stephen Maturin (Paul Bettany) towards his friend and commander are seen. The pair shares an interest in classical musicianship and an interest in the crew. But while Aubrey feels the need for battle and to rid the seas of his countries enemy, Maturin takes the more intellectual approach, voicing his opinion that rest is needed, that time should be taken rather than pursue the Acheron. Some might see this as a metaphor for the recent battles in Congress over the war in Iraq. That could be said. But I saw this more as the question that all men ask before launching into war. And the answers are never simple nor easily made.<br /><br />There is an underlying complexity to the character of Aubrey that Crowe brings forth. While he longs to face his enemy and to win, he also cares deeply for his ship and for its crew. His desire to win may cause him to make a wrong decision now and then, but deep down he would never put his men in the face of danger if he were not convinced he could save them.<br /><br />A final face off is inevitable but to reveal who wins would not only be a tremendous spoiler but would take away the effect it has on the viewer. Suffice to say that the movie truly never quite has an ending. But in a good way, not a \\"here we go again\\" one.<br /><br />The movie depicts the life of a sailor in these times in more realistic fashion than any movie I've seen before. While we are usually given old sea faring gents, this one shows us a combination of men who have no where else to go mingling with young lads who long for adventure. The range of ages was exactly that in those days.<br /><br />While a single hole in a ship meant a fast sinking vessel in most movies, this one shows that repairs could be and were made. The ships were not that easy to down. But it also allows us to see the damage caused by the cannonballs that slammed hard into the ship, inflicting more human damage than they could to the ship.<br /><br />While a sobering look at sea warfare, the movie also has its lighter moments. It also offers a testament to the human spirit as well. But most importantly it offers us something sorely lacking in today's world, something that has bothered me tremendously. It offers us a hero. A steadfast man capable of making mistakes but owning up to them and then rallying his troops to face off against a common enemy. The world lacks heroes these days. Perhaps we will only find them in film. But at least a new generation will have the chance to have that hero.no where else to go mingling with young lads who long for adventure.

B0010YSD7M|3.0|The \\"Ark of Truth\\" is basically what should have/would have been 3 or even 4 episode had the series continued on television.  But it's not.  It's a rather hurried 100 minutes of a mixed story line retreading the same themes: replicators endangering the ship and crew, the \\"evil\\" manipulations of the IOA, the uncompleted Ori story line, the small band of humans overcoming impossible odds to save the galaxy and mankind etc.  Frankly it leaves lot's of plot questions unanswered by its conclusion, just too many gaps in the story along with inconsistencies with the \\"Stargate history\\".  It does have some of the back story explaining the issues between the Ori and the Ancients and the creation of the Ark.    Robert Cooper wrote, directed and produced this direct to DVD video. I find doing all three things generally doesn't lead to better movies or videos.  Besides the weak story and plot line, the dialog is rather flat compared to numerous other SG-1 episodes.  Based on reviews I've seen, SG-1 fans will likely enjoy the DVD movie, but it is not the best effort of the series.    Image quality is good and looks nice upscaled by a Toshiba HD-A20 on a 62inch screen.  The accompanying sound track is ok.    PS  Have not yet watched the story behind extra (the DVD is really light in extras).  The prelude is a quick set of snippet from the entire Ori story arc, but is just that snippets (or visual sound bites).  It does nothing to advance the story.    PPS  Just for the blog ninja - I am a long time fan of the series ever since it made it debut (even have all episodes on DVD plus the original movie).  The series has had it's ups and downs, this movie is a bit of the latter.
B00008EY65|4.0|Comic fans have had a field day of late. They have had the opportunity to see a number of movies based on comics brought to life and done right for once. Past mistakes included a Captain America that tore out the heart of the star spangled hero while the original Punisher lost everything that made the character and replaced him with a stoic performance by Dolph Lundgren. All that has changed and this film keeps the ball rolling.    In the late 40's, a special forces team is on the trail of a hidden group of Nazis. The Nazis leader is Rasputin, the same mysterious monk from Russia, who is about to open a portal between this dimension and another. That dimension contains what we would call demons and what Hitler is calling a surprise ally. Only the team, led by young Professor Trevor 'Broom' Bruttenholm, stand in Rasputin's way, sending him to the other side. But in his place comes another creature, a small, red skinned, horned baby that they promptly call Hellboy.    Hellboy grows up to be a man during the credits and we are taken to a new secret organization, falling under the department of the FBI: the Bureau for Paranormal Research and Defense. Agent John Myers (Rupert Evans) has just been assigned to the organization to handle Hellboy (Ron Perlman). He was chosen specifically by Prof. Bruttenholm (John Hurt) but as to why we don't discover until further into the film.    Myers is introduced to Hellboy's fellow team member Abe Sapien (Doug Jones), an amphibious creature with telepathy to the extreme. He is then brought face to face with Hellboy himself. While he at first appears brutish, ill mannered and full of himself, as the movie progresses Myers gets to see the real, emotional side of the big red giant. And that makes up a better portion of the underlying story within the story, a creatures search for humanity.    Rasputin is back and still trying to open the portal he was forced through so many years ago. Aided by a surgery loving/enhanced ex-Nazi and his former lover, he has gathered the powers that be in an attempt to bring this about. One lure was Liz Sherman (Selma Blair), a fellow BPRD agent who left in search of a normal life. Once together, he baits them into a trap beneath the streets of New York. And with the power of Hellboy, he intends to open those dimensional gates and let loose the demons held at bay for so many years.    The movie is indeed a comic book brought to life. Director Guillermo del Toro has brought the imagery of the page to the screen. He knows comics, he loves comics and he has treated his source material with the respect it deserves. There are scenes throughout that would make perfect still shots that would fit in any comic.    The actors here all turn in performances that also do the material justice. None play their roles as over the top comic book characters. Again, this has been a problem in most films to be released in the past. Here, they are given respect as to the camp seen before. Ron Perlman does a fantastic job as Hellboy, making the character not only the tremendously strong, ferociously powerful creature one to fear if you are on the wrong side of the law, but he brings out the emotions beneath that red skin.     The effects, though mainly CGI, are well done and believable. Which is a credit to those in charge seeing as how it would have been almost impossible to present them any other way.    The movie has a few flaws but I only saw one that affected my viewing: the non-stop promotion machine that has pushed it into the public eye for so many months. I felt as if there was so little left for me to discover here, so little that I hadn't seen or had a glimpse of in the past few months. For once, this was a movie that lived up to the hype but at the same time had enough hype to almost blow the picture away.    For a fun time that most of the family can enjoy, except for those to easily impressed upon with violence, check this one out.

B0006IIPIK|3.0|For those who haven't heard word one about SKY CAPTAIN AND THE WORLD OF TOMORROW, the majority of the film was shot in blue screen format. This means that most of the film had actors on soundstages that were draped in green material, with few or no props and no backgrounds. Everything surrounding them was digitally placed in at a later date. Knowing this before hand makes this movie, which is very good on its own, even more amazing.    The story revolves first around Polly Perkins (Gwyneth Paltrow), a reporter for the cities major newspaper circa 1939. Contacted by a recently arrived professor, she comes into possession of documents just before the city is attacked by a squad of giant robots. These flying machines are indeed impressive, landing and marching through the streets as they seek out the city's generators. Polly is near killed save for the heroic rescue of Joe Sullivan, known as Sky Captain (Jude Law).     The pair has a history which leads to a familiar feel between the duo. Joe takes Polly back with him to his headquarters where his right hand man and tech supervisor Dex (Giovanni Ribisi) helps him to decipher clues from what was left of one of the giant robots. In the midst of their search, the headquarters is attacked by a group of flying machines unlike any ever seen. Working together, Joe and Dex are able to figure out where the commands of these robots are coming from. But not before the headquarters is demolished and Dex is taken prisoner.    With a clue left behind, Joe and Polly track Dex and the robots down to Nepal where they are about to encounter the biggest of bad guys, the infamous Totenkopf (Laurence Olivier...yes THE Laurence Olivier). What they discover in the frozen waste there is something that will surprise those unfamiliar with pulp magazine style writing. For those who have read, it is an image come to life on the big screen.    SKY CAPTAIN owes much to those episodic serials of the past as well as the heroics of action films of thethirties and forties. It is a homage to those films and yet retains its own vision as well. The images used seem like those seen so many years ago, filmed in soft focus and with a sepia tone to the proceedings. All of this enhances the feel of the film.    The action is non stop. It moves us from one scene to the next, picks us up and drops us off into the next. The acting is great in that where they could have played it all for camp, the actors instead take their roles seriously enough to make them believable in an onscreen way.    The special effects are mind boggling. And if you stay through the entire credits you will find out why. They move on for anywhere from 5-9 minutes with a number of effects studios put to the task of making this film come alive.     So what does the movie offer? Entertainment...action...a tribute to films from the past...and a fun filled time for all.
B000NDI3SK|5.0|I recently purchased the DVD set and completely enjoyed watching this series again. I originally saw the series on PBS in the early 80s. I was impressed by the series then, and just as impressed today. The quality of the DVDs is very good. The subject matter of the series is still relevant today, and the quality of the content far exceeds anything produced recently, in my opinion. Only the computer graphics and production graphics are slightly dated by today's standards. The series should be required viewing for high school and college science students, regardless of discipline.
B0001ZX0OW|4.0|I wasn't sure what to expect with MYSTIC RIVER. I know that Clint Eastwood is a highly underrated director. I know that the stars were all part of a generation of actors known for the quality of their work. But something about this movie never made me want to rush to see it. I'm glad that I finally got to it.<br /><br />The film opens with three young friends playing on the street, scraping their names in fresh cement. A police detective gives the kids a hard time for what they are doing and takes the one who doesn't live in the nearby houses home. The truth though is that this is not a policeman and he doesn't take him home. Rather young Dave Boyle is abducted by two pedophiles that he escapes from later.<br /><br />The movie then jumps forward to present day where one of those youngsters now grown, Jimmy Markum (Sean Penn) owns his own market and watches as his daughter goes out for the night before his other daughters first communion. It is the last time he will see her alive. The next day she is found, murdered.<br /><br />This sets about a chain of events and a reunion of sorts for the boyhood pals. The third member of the three is Sean Devine (Kevin Bacon) who is now a detective for the State Police. And the murder falls under his jurisdiction.<br /><br />Young Dave has grown (Tim Robbins) and is still haunted by the experiences of his past. And the night that Jimmy's daughter was murdered Dave saw her and also came home covered in someone else's blood. Putting these items together, Dave's wife Celeste (Marcia Gay Harden) begins to wonder about her husband. He claims to have been mugged and to have beaten the mugger to death. But no newspaper articles make her doubt his story.<br /><br />The main portion of the movie moves across the stories of the individuals involved. Jimmy wants vengeance and will do anything to find and kill the person responsible for his daughter's murder. Dave grapples with the demons of his past. And Sean just wants to believe that his friends can't be involved in the murder as he searches for the real killer.  Each becomes a piece of the puzzle, the answer of which is not revealed until films end. But by then, the world is turned upside down and facts are misplaced.<br /><br />While some might have thought this was a simple murder mystery, a whodunit put together by Eastwood, it is much deeper than that. It is a look into the psyche of three very different people who grew up together, who were affected by their past. The inner struggles of all three are different, but all tied into their past as well. And this makes for a drama unlike any mystery could hold.<br /><br />Perhaps the biggest thing that this film offers is a ton of outstanding performances that will be hard to match in any current film. An assembly of talent such as this is rare in today's films. Most notable is Sean Penn as the father in turmoil. All accolades he received were well deserved.<br /><br />Make a point of renting this one. You won't be disappointed. And the discovery of just who the killer is, whether it is Dave or perhaps Jimmy's daughter's boyfriend or someone else, makes for a fitting together of clues that mold well.

B00005JKC3|4.0|Yes, the Incredible Hulk, that monstrous, green apparition that became the rage in comics in the early sixties and television icon in the seventies is back on screen. And although a normal man still grows in size enough to split his shoes and shirt, his pants remain made of some elasticized material that never breaks. Those of us on the heavier side are still seeking out this material as I write.<br /><br />HULK made its way to the big screen in the biggest way possible. It was being touted as the next best thing since sliced bread before it even arrived. Directed by Ang Lee who was coming off of his art house AND theatrical hit CROUCHING TIGER, HIDDEN DRAGON, many were making predictions that this film would combine the pop culture found in comics with the artistic integrity found in this director. Face it, it was a no win situation for critics everywhere.<br /><br />But for audiences it was different. The hype surrounding the movie was as enormous as the Hulk himself. Anyone who blindly accepted that this movie would be the best movie ever made had no choice but to walk away disappointed. But those who went in looking for nothing more than a good movie, a movie that would capture the essence and imagination found in the pages of those brightly inked comics of the past were delighted.<br /><br />Story time. The story begins in the past when David Banner is researching DNA and trying his best to make a human that will renew its own body cells when harmed or injured. When the military doesn't allow him to try this on humans instead of animals, he infects himself. Not long after, he and his wife have a child. Recognizing that his son's DNA contains cells that were affected, he begins to search for a solution to change him back. Stopped by the military when they discover what he has been up to, he blows up the base and heads home. This portion of the film takes up the first minutes and is told in quick fashion, ending with David's son Bruce not recalling all that happened and waking from this nightmare.<br /><br />Moving forward, Bruce (Eric Bana) has grown into a young scientist himself, researching much of the same ideas his birth father had. At his side in this research is Betty Ross (Jennifer Connelly), his now ex-girlfriend. All of their attempts to replicate the adaptive powers of amphibians, their ability to renew cells when damaged, have ended in short term success and long term failure. The frogs blow up. An accident in the lab exposes Bruce to the same nanomites and gamma radiation the frogs were hit with. But instead of blowing up, he changes. The experiment works on him, recharging his body.<br /><br />The down side is revealed that night when Bruce's nightmares awake an anger, a rage, within. That rage changes him as well. The passive Bruce Banner finds his body physically altering until he becomes the primal essence of man, of himself. He turns into the overpowering Hulk.<br /><br />Green skinned, standing well over 9 feet tall, body formed of hyper increased muscles, Hulk leaves the hospital bed Banner was sleeping in. And as he makes his way into the world, everyone is well aware that the military will take notice and track him down.<br /><br />Part of what change Bruce while in that bed was a visit by the night janitor. It turns out that he is very familiar with Bruce since he is in fact his father David (Nick Nolte). Revealing himself and portions of what happened in Bruce's past (since Bruce was raised by adoptive parents and never told the truth), he is the catalyst that invokes the rage inside if Bruce.<br /><br />A multiple cat and mouse game follows with Betty trying to help Bruce, her ex-beau Talbot (Josh Lucas) trying to steal the program they were working on and eliminate Bruce as a competitor for Betty's affections. Betty's father, General Ross (Sam Elliott) tries to save his daughter from a man he fears (knowing all about Bruce's past) and sets out to gather the results of this experiment for militarypurposes at the same time. Bruce's father David attempts to harness the power and change from Bruce by using DNA samples found in hair left behind and applying them to his dogs and later on to himself. And through it all, Bruce is left to sort out each event on his own, with no help from anyone save Betty who realizes just how much he truly means to her.<br /><br />This story could be called a simple retelling of Beauty and the Beast. But it goes beyond that. It talks about the rage that we all keep in check, never saying the things that we would love to say from complaining about low wages to flipping off the bad driver on the highway. It talks about the inner beauty of a person overcoming the surface that is visible. And it talks about the abuse of power, of scientist willing to risk their souls because perhaps they don't believe in them anymore. But most of all, this movie brings alive the pages that we once read so long ago and makes them real.<br /><br />The standout in this movie, the make or break necessary to pull it off, is of course the visualization of the Hulk himself. Lee decided not to follow in the footsteps of the television series and instead opt for complete CGI (computer generated image). And the folks behind the special effects here have made the Hulk seem more real than any CGI images we have seen before. The rampaging Hulk would have been the easiest thing to do, with quick cuts and motion galore. But the passive Hulk, the one with facial expressions and emotion, that is where they truly shine. And the fact that he actually DOES resemble Bana is remarkable.<br /><br />No easy sell as was SPIDER-MAN, this movie is entertaining throughout. Don't go in looking for the television series. You won't find it. Instead, go in looking for a return to the original story. Go in looking for a visual feast in special effects. Go in without unreasonable expectations. If you do so, you will find that this movie delivers on all counts.<br /><br />For die hard fans, the DVD comes with a glut of extras, everything from a look at how the Hulk was made on film to interpretations of various scenes if they were drawn by some of the top artists working in comics today. All of the extras make this DVD one worth owning.arness the power and change from Bruce by using DNA samples found in hair left behind and applying them to his dogs and later on to himself.

1401300529|3.0|I have been reading these reviews prior to getting this book.  Many people seem to be disappointed in the coverage of the Korean War by this author as well as certain inacurracies, e.g. the rebuilding of the highway bridge by army engineers as the Marines fought their way south in their retreat from the Choisin Reservoir.  You might be interested to read \\"BREAKOUT: The Chosin Reservoir Campaign, Korea 1950.\\"  The author is Martin Russ who also wrote \\"The Last Paralell.\\"  This is a riveting account of the incredible battles by the Marines to survive an onslaught by thousands of Chinese soldiers and then to fight their way south from the Chosin Reservoir.  As in \\"The Coldest Winter\\", General MacArthur does not come off well at all in terms of his judgment and decision-making.
B0002Z0EYK|5.0|Movies these days are won or lost on the hype that precedes them. Not only that, but after those expectations are developed, the film maker must follow through for that movie to have any staying power which results in it's making any money at the box office. So often we are built up to believe one thing only to be disappointed once we sit down and the lights go dim. Such is not the case with TROY.<br /><br />Many years ago the sword and sandal movies were a staple in Hollywood. They reached a grand scale with movies like BEN-HUR and bottomed out with others like HERCULES IN NEW YORK. But these films were movies that people went to see and either loved or hated. Times changed and with the interest in more real storied that developed in the late sixties and early seventies, it seemed none were made. The release and success of GLADIATOR changed that. And as much as I enjoyed that film, I liked this one even more.<br /><br />For those who don't know the story or have never read the Iliad (include me in that category), it revolves around the attempts of Agamemnon (Brian Cox) to bring together all of the states of Greece under his rule. He is out to establish an empire and is on the verge of doing just that. The film opens with a battle between his army and that of Thessaly about to occur. A challenge is made and they place their best man against his to cut down on casualties, winner takes all. His challenger is Achilles (Brad Pitt), the fiercest warrior ever known. The battle takes mere seconds and the character of Achilles is established for all to see.<br /><br />The scene shifts to Sparta where the brother of Agamemnon and king, Menelaus (Brendan Gleason) has just signed a peace treaty with Troy and its representatives Prince Hector (Eric Bana) and Prince Paris (Orlando Bloom). As a feast ensues, Menelaus wife Helen (Diane Kruger) leaves to her room, followed by Paris. The two have been together since his arrival and now she plans to run off with him. This sets in motion the war that is to be waged as Menelaus attempts to regain his wife while Agamemnon uses the excuse to lead his army into battle to win Troy.<br /><br />Leading a fleet of a thousand ships, Agamemnon must also swallow his pride for a moment. He and Achilles never see eye to eye and have even come close to battle themselves. But with the help of Odysseus (Sean Bean) he recruits Achilles to be a part of this force setting out for Troy.<br /><br />It is not for the sake of Agamemnon that Achilles fights. Nor is it for the honor of Menelaus or to rescue his wife. Achilles fights for glory and for honor. He fights so that his name might live on long after he has departed Earth. A vision by his mother Thetis (Julie Christie) tells him this will happen, but that he will never return to her.<br /><br />The ships sail and the Trojans prepare for war. Their walls have never been breached and they are confidant that no matter who attacks, they will be victorious. King Priam (Peter O'Toole) backs his son Paris' and his love for Helen. War is coming their way and they are as prepared as they can be to battle this incredible army.<br /><br />There you have it, the set up for a grand and glorious movie about war. And in reading just that much, you might expect that it deals only with the victories and failures of the men involved. But there is so much more going on in this film. And amazingly enough, it never presents war as a bad thing or a good thing. It shows it for what it really is, a clash of two parties that yields both good and bad.<br /><br />It shows the honor between men fighting together in a solid unit as one, using tactics instead of brute strength to win a battle. It shows men willing to lay down their lives for something they believe in, for a leader that commands them to do so.<br /><br />At the same time, it shows a leader who is blinded by his own ego, men dying due to poor leadership and the fact that death is everlasting and not a grand as the cry before battle might make it out to be. Some men will walk away as heroes to be spoken of from that day forward. Others will become nothing more than fuel for funeral pyres.<br />The mix of these ideas back and forth makes this movie more real than most and less political than many would assume we will find in this day and age.<br /><br />The battles are well made, presenting not only the best that CGI has to offer in showing thousands involved in combat, but the up close fighting is more real than most seen in some time. The hand to hand combat, the archers' arrows landing in the most gruesome ways, the use of anything on hand to become a weapon make it all seem real.<br /><br />The acting is stupendous with Brad Pitt taking the lead. Pitt has done some great films in the past and has shown that he is not just another pretty face. But this film uses everything from his looks to his physical abilities to form a character that the audience comes to sympathize with as well as fear.<br /><br />Eric Bana also excels as Hector. His character is also a warrior to be reckoned with but one with more heart, with more at stake, with more foresight to see what can become of this whole mess. While Achilles fights for glory, Hector fights to protect his land and his family, to protect that which he loves most. And Bana portrays this with an insight rarely seen or shown in most actors these days.<br /><br />Perhaps the weakest link in the entire film is a character that should be center stage, Paris as played by Orlando Bloom. While I thought him fantastic in the LORD OF THE RINGS films, Bloom has yet to make an impression on me since. His portrayal of Paris here is as if he were a twit and a coward, a man who thinks only of himself and his pleasures at the expense of everything and everyone else. If this was who he was then Bloom does a better job than I give him credit for. I still see him as only a simpering wimp here and not the hottest actor working today.<br /><br />The directing is amazing with Wolfgang Peterson turning in another stupendous job. He uses everything he can at his disposal to get the tale put onscreen in its entirety. Scenes of battle mingle with scenes of tenderness, both presented as real and as a part of the story that when brought together tell the entire tale.<br /><br />Hollywood has for years forsaken the genre of epic in an attempt to make more money on smaller films. Battling against everything from video games to the internet, it has gone back to draw viewers into seats once more. If they can continue to produce films like this they will continue to prosper. TROY is a film that fulfilled all of my expectations, though to be honest they were not high to begin with.

B0010YSD7M|5.0|... Stargate: Ark of Truth is a great film and an amazing ending to the Ori storyline. Everyone else has gone into the production value, the quality, etc, so I'll spare you. If you are a fan of the franchise, the movie lives up to the quality of programming we have become used to. If you are not yet a fan, why the heck not! ;0) This movie will whet your appetite for more, just be sure to watch the intro to get caught up on the story.
0767834739|4.0|Fans of the game Resident Evil are committed to the game. They began with the first and moved on the each and every incarnation after. They were tickled pink to learn that a movie was being made of the game and somewhat disappointed in what they received. But those same fans should rejoice at the latest installment, RESIDENT EVIL: APOCALYPSE.    The film pick up where the last left off, with Alice (Milla Javovich) waking in the labs of the Umbrella Corporation to find it empty, then moving upwards to the city streets to find a world in chaos. It then jumps to the other characters in the film and the fact that Racoon City has been walled of and sealed with most of its citizens still inside (except for high placed scientists or company big shots).     In short order we meet Jill Valentine (Sienna Guillory), a tough as nails cop recently placed on suspension, who wants nothing to do with Racoon City and is looking for a way out. Of course after blowing away a few of the risen dead in her police squad room.   The risen dead you say?    For those who missed the first film or have yet to try out the game, the movie is based around a ruthless corporation that has founded a city of its own called Racoon City. Beneath this metropolis they have constructed a super secret lab known as the Hive. An accident released a toxic weapon they had been developing that killed off all of the Hive workers only to bring them back from the dead with an insatiable appetite for human flesh. Yes, we're talking zombies here kids.     Back to the characters. We witness the special team sent in to help control Racoon City, it's biggest name member being Carlos Olivera (Oded Fehr) who leads the team through the streets and alleys as they try to first control the zombies and later to find a way out. We also meet L.J. (Mike Epps), a street wise local who survives an attack by Nemesis while in the company of another elite force in town known as S.T.A.R.     The movie plays like the game in many ways.First and foremost, it offers tons of action from fight sequences between characters like Alice and Nemesis to battling the now famous genetically mutated Dobermans. These fight scenes are a mix of good and bad in that they don't focus non stop on close ups (ala BOURNE SUPREMACY) but give us a combination of those, medium and long shots to see the entire fight instead of its participants reactions to that fight.     But beneath the action lies the conspiracy or puzzle of the film. This one offers several beginning with the crux of the picture where a scientist with access to his computer and cameras that hand on nearly every street corner in town, who contacts Alice and Jill with an offer to get them out safely. All they have to do is locate his daughter, rescue her and bring her out.     As the group working together to achieve their goal grows, they face the ever present danger of the zombies that litter the street. And eventually face off the aforementioned Nemesis. Nemesis is the mutated friend of Alice who also survived the first film. This time around, he has changed considerably, resembling something not quite human and nearly indestructible.     The last element of the game brought to life on screen and hinted at in the description of events above is that horror element found in any good zombie flick. This one features some great looking zombies with make up that stands up to any seen in horror films of late.     This combination of horror, puzzle to solve and action fare is brought together expertly under the direction of helmer Alexander Witt. A secondary director for a number of films, this is his first as man in charge. And he shows great promise with this one, combining just the right touch of each to pull of the transition from game monitor to big screen.    If you love the game, if you love horror films or if you just plain out love escapist fare that is not for the average viewer, then you will love this film. I left finding myself surprised, havingexpected much less after the first film. This one caught me off guard and was a must add for my DVD collection.
B000XA5K4I|4.0|The only reason I'm writing this review is that I was shocked at how many folks rated this film a one star!  Are you kidding me?  Either we've got a bunch of people who don't like non stop raise the roof action, or people who have absolutely no sense of humor.  Come on now.  This film was not meant to be taken seriously.  That's the whole point of the film!  The film makers, actors and crew are having a blast with this tongue in cheek, almost parody of all the action film cliché's ever assembled.      What makes the film so cool is that they play it totally straight, but if anyone actually thinks this was meant to be a serious action film, you're just plain nuts.  This movie is so over the top, so fun, so action packed that I've been telling all my friends that they just have to check this one out.  I noticed other reviews that said this film was so bad that they've been telling all their friends to stay away.  DON'T LISTEN TO 'EM.      And for you Blu-Ray fans, you get a fantastic video transfer and an audio track that will literally shake your foundation.  One of the best Hi-Def action movie presentations for both audio and video that I've seen on the format.      Sure this film isn't for everyone, but I'm assuming that anyone who'd go and buy a film called \\"Shoot `Em Up\\" would just eat this stuff up.  It does what the title says... and more.     ROCK ON!    jd
0452289963|5.0|Awesome book!  Everyone should read it.  I have been so amazed at the learning, the transformation and the explanations re: my life.  This really is something that everyone should read! Very enlightening!    I have had more AHA moments that I can count! This book has struck a cord deep inside me...opened up ideas I would have never discovered and yet also put words/descriptions to things that I have always felt deep within but couldnt verbalize.  If everyone were to discover the truths contained within this book, we might be able to change our society!  This book as shaken me to my core!!
B000NA1XSA|5.0|Very informative and a must read for any Beatles fan and scholar. He seems to be one-sided on certain things but if you don't take everything as absolute truth and read between the lines, you can get a lot out of this book.    Good work Geoff.
B000ZINGIK|2.0|Sorry to be a party pooper with all these rave reviews,but apart from two or three tracks,this album is a retread of older Edguy songs.You can name each track if your memory is good enough,but even if you can't,you KNOW them already.The only really original tune is The Toymaster,and to a lesser extent, I Don't Believe in Love,and Lost in Space.In fact part of one track is a total ripoff of a Rob Halford tune.If you've never heard any other Edguy albums,then this will be a good listen nonetheless.
B00138KE2W|5.0|I bought the album after I got a few mp3s. I just think the CD is better. You have to hear all the songs in order to respect the work of the artist. Definitely a CD to buy and pick up the single \\"Say\\" while your at it.
B0000A98ZP|5.0|The version constantly on TV every Saturday at 3pm just isn't the same as the original--no other 80s movie depicts the secret souls of teenage-labels like this one!  Estevez, Hall and Nelson at their best!
B000YDDUIW|5.0|Greatest band of all time! What else can I say. Wish it was a DVD!
B0006U4UAU|1.0|These CDs come with the infamous \\"Copy Controlled\\" technology which requires you to install software on your computer just so you can play it.  If you want to jump through hoops in order to play your disc, and you would also like to risk possible negative side-effects of the newly installed software, this CD is for you! Perhaps there are other versions of this CD out there.  I wish I had not purchased this one.  Too bad, because the music on it is good from what I heard at a friend's house.
B000MRA5NS|5.0|Ok this review can be approached in two ways, one the sheer pleasure of Blu-Ray, secondly, as a bond movie.    Blu-ray:  This movie is a true 1080p, and if you have an HDTV you have to get this movie. Sound quality is amazing, Picture quality is really good and not grainy. Features are interesting, you could get some with a standard DVD but Amazon Blu-Ray deals make this movie worth getting.    Movie:  This has to be one of the top Bond Movies, Daniel Craig was a perfect bond who, after Pierce Brosnan, plays a stark, and methodical bond, who express his emotions very well. He is amazing as bond, the movie was directed very well, and is not as over the top as all the 1990's bond movies.    Overall:  I definatley reccomend this movie to anyone who owns a blu-ray player or is a true bond fan.
B000XPU5NY|3.0|At some point, long lived bands become retro-bands. They don't have to but they usually do. One of the symptoms is when they release the same damn recording again and again. Just look at the song list and ask yourself, why? Its not because they're forward looking that's for sure.
B000FJGWBM|5.0|Again, my reviews will relate to both the Blu-Ray and overall Movie plot and character synopsis.    Blu-Ray:  The difference is notced on a HDTV and also if it is large enough. Up-converting DVD's will suffice untill a tv break the 40\\" mark. The movie is excellent the features are amazing, and gives you great insight into the true thinkings of the director and. I reccomed this movie as a must have for Blu-ray fanatics. 1080p is awesome.    Movie:  One word, Brilliant. You have to watch this movie at least twice to fully comprehend what is going to happen. Masterfully directed, I have to say this movie stays in your mind even after you have already seen it. All I can say is that you are missing out by not watching this movie.
0743486285|5.0|This book is amazing, not just because I am a Crue fan but also as an avid reader. The way this book is done is refreshing, the diary entries and then modern day comment from Nikki and others around at that time. A whole new insight to the then and now type of writing. I loved it! He brings you into the darkness of his closet and then with modern entries bring you back into the light. This book should be read by anyone dealing with addictions and depression issues because it will give you hope.

B00006CXSS|5.0|The product arrived very quickly, the movie is outstanding. have watched it on tv everytime it comes on and thought I would check to see if it had gone down in price, and it had, now I have the dvds of Band of Brothers and can watch it straight through.
B0000VCZK2|5.0|As an Alien enthusiast, I have to say that this is the ultimate collection to have.  Not only does it have the original versions of all four movies but it has the directors/extended cut for each and every movie.  This helps shed some light on what was originally intended for these movies as well as give some depth to Ripley and how she dealt with everything going on around her, from Alien through her resurrection.    There are tons of extra features on this 9 disc set and the boxing is awesome as well.  It comes with a pamphlet that really tells you what is on each disc with some added words from the directors of each movie.  This is a really awesome box set to add to your collection.
B000TSIK14|5.0|Amazing cd....the voice, the guitar are incredibles...If you are a Scorpions fan, you must have it....it's the same band but a little more powerfull!!
0307383415|3.0|This is a solid memoir that is very well written for a politician working without a ghost writer.  I think the eloquence and overall quality have been exaggerated by his political admirers, but it does contain honest insights into the memories of a man who aspires to great power.  I would not call it easy to read.  The ambivalence and conflicts Mr. Obama has struggled with throughout his early life about his family and racial identity are obvious on every page.  Personally, I was uncomfortable reading this and ultimately found the book profoundly depressing (hence 3 stars instead of 4).        I find it hard to reconcile the self-portrait in this book with the candidate of \\"Hope\\" filling the pages of today's papers.  In fairness, it was written many years ago, so that projecting his current state of mind from this early book is not appropriate.  Unfortunately,  \\"Audacity of Hope\\" is a much more political book by comparison and I did not find it very revealing.       If you are curious to see something of the man behind the speeches, I would recommend this book unreservedly.
0316001821|5.0|From the violence that unexpectedly opens this story to the discovery of her \\"wide, wide heaven\\" at the end, the story of Susie Salmon is unique in its delivery as it maintains the viewpoint of a young girl watching, from heaven, as her family struggles to cope with her death.<br /><br />Heaven is not what you'd expect.  There are gazebos, pets, and friends that come and go, even an intake counselor.  Susie may have anything her heart desires, anything except what she wants most - to be back on Earth with the people she loves.  From this strange place, she watches her family and friends move through their grief, while the villain maddeningly will not, in any concrete form, give away proof of his guilt.<br /><br />Susie's death brings together two unique characters, Ruth, a high school acquaintance, and Ray, the boy who loved Susie from afar, outcasts and loners at school, who discover a common ground in Susie's death.  Ruth and Ray eventually move on in life, Ray to medical school, and Ruth, forever transformed by a brief brush with Susie's spirit, to live out her unique destiny in New York City, but Ruth eventually enables a last meeting between Susie and Ray, and Susie reclaims a little bit of the growing up that she was robbed of so long ago.<br /><br />\\"When the dead are done with the living, the living can go on to other things,\\" Frannie, the intake counselor, advises Susie.

B000HEWEE4|5.0|These two are so great together - must be some reason they aren't together permanently - there's such a connection there. At least it sure appears so on screen.
B000Y179KO|5.0|Not sure what cd the Elmore dude has been listening to, but if you are a so called \\"Eagle Fanatic\\" you should know that these guys don't make nothing but great music together.  I play guitar and have been an Eagle fan from the start.  This cd is nothing short of brilliant.  After listening to the cd 3 or 4 times you will really appreciate each and every track.    The lyrics and music are just great as always.  Its so cool to have Timothy and Joe sing on a few songs.  Also John David Souther contributes to his friend's cd with a couple on well written tracks.  The Eagles are one of those bands that can get together anytime and write superb music.  Hope this is not their last cd together.

B000ZN8036|5.0|I love adventure and exploration.  I yearn for it and yet most of my life has been spent in cities, in relationships, looking for sex or excitement or another high of some artificial kind.  Oh I've done some hang gliding, motorcycle racing, downhill sking, water sking, scuba diving, etc, but far to seldom have I really been out there on a wilderness adventure.  One five day hike in the Grand Canyon, one ten day hike in Mexico's Copper Canyon, a few camping trips and hunting trips. Colorado to ski for a few days or boating on Lake Powell for a week or two.  Most likely in my 63 years less than a month of actually being out there surrounded by nature with even a slight chance of dying from anything other than natural causes or a traffic accident.  I certainly never came close to starving to death or being eaten by a hungry bear or lion.    I first read Into Thin Air by Jon Krakauer after reading about the 1996 Mount Everest disaster and Jon's report of it in Outdoor Magazine.  I enjoyed the book so I decided to read his book of similar title, Into the Wild.  Very different story and to me, very personal.  The story touched my soul in a way few other stories have.  Kind of like the first time I read Desert Solitaire by Edward Abbey.  It got to me on a very emotional, gut-wrenching level that brought up a lot of emotions, regrets and memories.      When I read that Sean Penn was going to make a movie based on the book I at first was skeptical that he could pull it off and expected another \\"Hollywood flic\\" based on the \\"true story\\".    I then read an article/interview about Sean's 10 year involvment with the project and his personal attachment to the story and the family and began to think that just maybe this would be a film worth seeing.    YES!!!  As perfect an adaption of movie from book as I've ever seen.  The move is great even though the story in the end is sad and you don't exactly walk out of the theater feeling great.  I felt sorry for the kid who in the end really didn't have chance to survive his dream.  You have to be really tough and experienced to survive in the wilderness and Chris for all his energy and motivation to live off the land was not prepared in the least to really pull it off.  He had some close calls in the lower 48, but in the Alaskan wilderness it was just a matter of time before his luck ran out.    I can relate to Chris and in my heart I'd like to try the same thing, but I now know better.  I now like sleeping in my own bed and not on the frozen ground in a not so warm sleeping bag.  In my dreams I sometimes venture out to Chris's world and watching this film takes me to a place I'm sure I've been before. Or was it just a dream?

B00000JY1X|5.0|If you are fan of intelligent and clever lyrics that never sacrifice humour and irony for the sake of their art, while simultaneously upholding musical/instrumental integrity (yes, there is something for the poet and music snob here), this is quite possibly the perfect album of its kind either before its release or after. Could easily be called the best album of the last ten years, making critically-acclaimed artists such as Radiohead look like experimental hacks.

B00114LF4E|5.0|Decca has kept Karajan's opera recordings in print but been very sketchy wth his orchestral work for their label. Compared with his hundreds of releases for EMI and DG, Karajan made about a dozen hours of symphonic recordings for Decca in a brief span between 1959 and 1965, but they are special because all feature the Vienna Phil.  This was Karajan's second orchestra, as it was for Furtwangler before him. But that's not to imply that there was lack of affinity between conductor and musicians: Karajan was an Austrian, after all, and to my mind the stylistic match is perfect.  The delicious string tone in the Dvorak 8th, for example, could only be Viennese, and Karajan is isnpired to give a warm, flexible reading -- his best on disc. There are drawbacks, however, as in a Brahms First that seems mushy and mannered, a surprise from this master Brahmsian.<br /><br />These 9 CDs are offered at super-budget price (cheaper than Naxos!), and each deserves five stars, with the possible exception of the Haydn \\"Drumroll\\" and \\"London\\" symphonies, which sound overblown and outdated, however elegant Karajan's touch may be. For many the high point will be the Strauss recordings, both Johann and  Richard. This famous Zarathustra still sounds magnificent, but so do Don Juan, Till Eulenspiegel, and the Johann Strauss items. Almost without exception these readings are warmer than those from Berlin, and Karajan's tendency toward glossy surfaces at the expense of meaning is not in evidence. As one would expect from Decca, the sonics are excellent, and I'm glad that the producers didn't scrub out so much tape hiss that the treble was compromised.  Strangely, there's no indication of any remastering, even though at least half these performances have previously appeared -- or currently appear -- in updated versions.<br /><br />The complete listing of works is as follows:<br /><br />Brahms:<br />Symphony No.1 in C minor, Op.68<br />Symphony No.3 in F major, Op.90<br />Tragic Overture, Op.81<br /><br />Haydn:<br />Symphony No.103 in E flat major, \\"Drumroll\\"<br />Symphony No.104 in D major, \\"London\\"<br /><br />Mozart:<br />Symphony No.40 in G minor, K550<br />Symphony No.41 in C major, K551 \\"Jupiter\\"<br /><br />Tchaikovsky:<br />Romeo and Juliet - Fantasy Overture<br />Suite from \\"Swan Lake\\"<br />Suite from \\"The Nutcracker\\"<br />Suite from \\"Sleeping Beauty\\"<br /><br />Beethoven:<br />Symphony No.7 in A major, Op.92<br /><br />Dvorak:<br />Symphony No.8 in G major, Op.88<br /><br />Adam:<br />\\"Giselle\\"<br /><br />Grieg: Excerpts from \\"Peer Gynt\\" Op.23<br /><br />Holst:<br />The Planets, Op.32<br /><br />J.

B000XVT7SW|5.0|If you are familiar with von Karajan's brilliant 1965 recordings of Cav/Pag that he made in Milan for DGG, two of the finest recordings yet made of this matched pair of one act operas, then you already know of his affinity for these two verismo masterworks. He seems to extract the beauty and power from their gritty melodrama without wallowing in their undeniably tawdry undertones. Most important, von Karajan takes them seriously. He treats them as if they were major works by Verdi or Wagner and not as the sole success of each composer that they in fact are. This makes all the difference in the world. How much more beautiful is Cavalleria Rusticana when the music is played with such lavish sonority and such broadly defined tempos? Von Karajan offered us his best on his 1965 recording and he offers us his best here, in a production that can only be described as lucious, filmed on the island of Sicily in 1968, its images still looking gorgeous after all these years. This film might double as a time-capsule travelogue of Sicily, the ancient home of Phoenicians and Greeks all those millennia ago. The landscape is eternal and von Karajan captures that same ageless quality in this filmed performance. The singing is lip-synched well, allowing the performers to concentrate on their acting. Fiorenza Cossotto was the quintessential  Santuzza of her era, as she shows here. Giangiacomo Guelfi is a strong Alfio. The rest of the cast is uniformly excellent, the recording and film superb.<br /><br />Jon Vickers was the finest Canio of his time. If you have seen his Peter Grimes, his Otello or his Fidelio, then you know what power and stature he brought to a role. This film of a La Scala stage production breathes fire. Vickers is riveting in his portrayal of Canio. The DVD is worth its price merely for the thrill of watching Vickers' incendiary performance. Raina Kabaivanska as Nedda and Peter Glossop as Tonio hold their own, as do the rest of the cast. But Vickers is the story here, he is stunning! Von Karajan conducts the Orchestra e Coro del Teatro Alla Scala with great beauty and power, but also with great tact, stepping out of the way and letting the singers act the drama. It is a splendid performance.<br /><br />The full screen films have been remastered and look fine. Sound in both PCM stereo and DTS 5.1 is crystalline in clarity. The usual DGG booklet, menus and translations are here. The total disc time is 148 minutes.<br /><br />Cav/Pag was a von Karajan specialty and this DVD shows why his reputation was what it was. The performance by Vickers must be experienced at least once, he was the finest male operatic actor of his era. Here are a pair of exemplary films on a DVD that won't gather dust on your shelf. Most strongly recommended.<br /><br />Mike Birmanstunning!

B0000714BP|5.0|The first time I saw this movie, I totally fell in love with it.  Patrick Swayze makes such a beautiful woman. Well, why not, he is such a handsome man!!!  I love this movie so much that I purchased 2 of them so that my daughter could have one for her collection. She had never seen it so we watched it together while she was home for spring break from college and she loved it too. She said she was going to make sure to get her whole sorority to watch it too.
1594489505|2.0|I guess I don't share everyone's raving opinion. To me, \\"Kite Runner\\" was sheer simple genius, and I could not wait to get my hands on this book. I found it not nearly as engaging, and filled, unfortunately, with an enormous amount of misogynistic anti-woman violence. It was hard to read. It did not convey the wonder and richness of the culture that \\"Kite Runner\\" did. It made me think that all Afghani men are evil. I actually hated this book.
B0010YSD7M|5.0|If you are reading this, yes, all night 4 times... no, not that, I have seen it 4x now.  A lot of \\"answers\\" packed into an epic style true movie with dynamic visuals and sound.  As a fan for all 10 years and all 10 seasons on DVD... I'm liken this a lot.    Cam and Sam lead the way with Cam really coming into his SG-1 role as leader and commander and he does it very well and naturally.  Something that took 2 seasons to come into, but he does with great satisfaction.    Sam continues well and as expected in a true to character role as a declared \\"I got your back\\" team member.  Have you noticed she addresses Cam as \\"Cam\\" and not sir?  I never heard her say \\"Jack\\".  These two continue the first name basis.  If you've notice the last few season a very subtle affection growing between Sam and Cam, it continues here with a closing scene that is \\"just right\\", but I could see more in the next production.  It's clear she accepts his leadership and is fond of him all at the same time while not breaking regulations.  She is a bit \\"sexier\\" a few times too.    Daniel is true blue also nothing out of character, but finally manages to get the Ancients to cooperate and interven on behalf of human kind... finally.    Teal'c also is spot on in his traditional role in doing anything he can to forge ahead, enduring, strong, spiritual and finally \\"helped\\" by a \\"touch\\" from the Ancients too.  Nice.    Vala, except for the first scene, finally \\"settles down\\" and is less annoying in this 'episode' than so many of the others.  She is finally a full team member, is receptive and \\"tuned in\\" to Daniel while handling her relationship with all her men with calm and maturity... nice to see as her previous \\"methods\\" always kept me \\"away\\" from liking her character.      All the rest of the cast and crew are here too, no one is left out and Landry, Walter and others all do their \\"standard\\" stuff, no tricks.    Morgan Lafay finally reveals all with Daniel, cooperates with him after his torture, has mercy and finally... finally steps in on behalf of the Ancients.  Divine intervention that is the only way to deal with Adria.  I identify with this personally as I often feel things could \\"work out\\" here on earth IF we could just get some help once in awhile.    No spoilers here, but the IOA finally \\"intrudes\\" in a way that almost costs us our human civilization in the Milky Way Galaxy by hijacking the \\"approved\\" mission to find the Ark with an alternative \\"plan\\" set forth in a \\"rogue\\" fashion that proves to be catostrophic and Sam and Cam gotta deal with the Replicators... yes, again.    No \\"alternate reality\\" stuff either... straight on adventure and challenges that all ends well and leaves me feeling \\"satisfied\\" after 10 years with my favorite TV show ever.  \\"They\\" could have made a mistake trying to be spectacular to extreme and go overboard, but this is an epic long adventure that's true to a movie form with action and adventure and \\"hanging on till the end\\" and that is the way it should be and the way \\"we all\\" want to remember this great series.
B000WZAE1I|4.0|This movie was very funny; I don't know why it  didnt get better reviews. Maybe I liked it because I like the whole fantasy genre.
B0010YSD7M|3.0|Sorry to break up the love fest. I am a Stargate Fan and was pumped about this dvd release. Unfortunately, The Ark of Truth is just so-so.     Don't worry no spoilers in this review. The movie will give you a temporary \\"SG-1 fix\\". I'm not sure that it's worth buying the dvd though. The writing was average. Same story different show... find the artifact, figure out the ancient magic, defeat the enemy after a superhuman effort, save the day. The special effects were pretty good. The absence of Richard Dean Anderson has really hurt Stargate in general.
0618918248|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book from cover to cover. I thought it provided great insight on a lot of human behavior. As far as the \\"angry condescension\\" to religion that many people seem to mention - I don't really take it like that. I see it as someone who is greatly frustrated with the horrendous acts and behaviors carried out in the name of religion, like the Spanish Inquisition of olden times and homophobia of modern times.  I especially enjoyed the fact that he got into morality and the omnipresence of religion worldwide. It was really great to hear non-religious perspectives on those subjects.
B0010YSD7M|5.0|If you didn't like the show, you probably won't be that into this. If you liked the show, just like shiny special effects and explosions, or just like Science Fiction - this is for you. (Although, if you haven't seen the show, I'd recommend that as well, so you don't get confused. The movie stands well on its own but it is the culmination of the 9th and 10th seasons, so newcomers may want to see all the back story too).
1594489505|5.0|I can not imagine why this brilliant novel should not make a sweep of the major book awards this year. Hosseini has managed to top his excellent first novel with one even more moving and more beautifully written. Part of his genius is making the plight of two women in Aghanistan and their culture so accessible to American readers.  The story is brutal and sad. but his compassion somehow keeps it from ever becoming overwhelming or depressing.      Hosseini's writing manages to be poetic but never pretencious.  As a storytelling he keeps his story moving at a page-turning and compelling pace.     The final portion of this novel moved me to tears repeatedly, in a way very few of the thousands of books I have read in my life ever had, making it one of the most moving novels I have ever read.
B000VUFJ3C|4.0|so this album isn't likely to appeal to everyone, but Backstreet fans of old will adore it. And anyone willing to give it a try might find that they actually like some of the songs. Its not groundbreaking, but its a good solid album from a band most people had already thrown to the wayside. They're still together which says alot since most of their type of group don't stick for this long. Even without Kevin, who unlike some think did provide a nice low voice, and his piano playing was beautiful but since I'm an AJ fan as long as he's still here I'm fine, his voice is still as strong and unique and as beautiful as ever, Brian's as pure and innocent, and Nick and Howie seem to be coming more into their own...  But as someone else already wrote, my big problem is the same problem I've ALWAYS had with their music, and with similar groups... Why does EVERYTHING have to be about relationships and heartbreak? They must do other things, think other thoughts... I know they don't write most of the music, but there must be some writers who write good music that's not about those things? I mean its just a thought... Why not a song about their dogs? Anything else would be refreshing...
B000PFU7OO|4.0|I purchased this cd because the movie was a surprise hit for me. I abhor musicals but this one didn't feel like one. As I reached for the DVD at the video store, another customer let out a gasp and told me that the movie had an awesome soundtrack and she highly recommended it. I hadn't even solicited her opinion.<br /><br />She was right. I loved it. There are maybe 2 or 3 songs that I skip over but the soul of this music is beautiful. In the special features of the movie, I believe Glen Hansard describes the organic process of how this cd came to fruition. It won't be magic for everyone but for me it stuck.<br /><br />It's raw and just perfect for background (or foreground for that matter)music. It relaxes me on my ride home in a normally, frustrating traffic jam. But mostly, I love listening to it on my MP3 player while riding my motorcycle along an expanse of Arizona farmland with a mountain backdrop at \\"the magic hour\\" where the sun casts a goldeny-orange glow over the entire scene. Yum!

0385338724|5.0|Lexie Smart. Was she or was she not Ghandi in a previous life? The fun and farcical story of Lexie Smart has the heroine in this tale, Remember Me?, wondering how she got to a completely different station in life between the years 2004 and 2007. She believes she's stumbled into a dream life, but soon steps into a hornet's nest of complications, including finding out she's married to a \\"guy she just met,\\" Eric, who is so rigid you have to sit up straighter just reading about him. She also discovers her best mates, a colorful threesome, have grown to hate her and call her the \\"bitch boss from hell.\\"<br /><br />Having no basis for comparison with the author's earlier works, this was just plain an enjoyable little story about a young woman trying to piece together her life after a car accident causes her to suffer from amnesia. She can't remember the last three years of her life and the drastic changes she underwent to go from a snaggletooth bumbler to a high-styled corporate bigwig married to a millionaire. It's well written, very funny and has a clever plot that kept me turning pages at a record pace. I can see why Kinsella has so many fans and look forward to reading her Shopaholic series.<br /><br />Michele Cozzens is the author of [[ASIN:1932172300 It's Not Your Mother's Bridge Club]]
032147404X|5.0|I found the book to be easy to read through for a first time.  And because of how it is broken into meaningful chapters and indexed, it is easy to reference back to particular subjects of interest.  I plan to use it as part of my pre-trip planning on my photo shoots.
B000ZLFALS|1.0|A couple months ago when this movie first came out on blu-ray, I almost, ALMOST bought it. I really thought it was going to be the type of amazing movie that I didn't NEED to see before buying. I was sure I would really love it......I could not have been more wrong.<br /><br />This isn't even a movie as much as its a ton of badly done music videos strung together for over 2 hours of the most awful bit of film I think I have ever viewed. The visuals weren't even that great. Nothing really spectacular here. It was kinda like \\"I'm gonna see how many weird effects I can fit into 2 hours! Then I'm gonna create characters with VERY vague back stories JUST so I can name them after people in famous Beatles songs! THEN! I'm gonna put them in random, ridiculous situations so I'll have an excuse for the cast to break out into those songs! This isn't a bad idea at all!!!\\"...........................<br /><br />Can someone please help me find the plot here? Girl loses boyfriend in the war...someone I don't even remember seeing at all, girl meets boy, girl shacks up with boy, girl and boy sing countless love songs to show their feelings for eachother.....then I turned it off. I don't even know, nor do I want to know what happens in the last hour. After Bono showed up, this movie was totally dead to me.<br /><br />This was nothing more than a badly done, pretentious, overblown, under-developed, poor excuse to remake Beatles songs with an EXTREMELY thin, cliched plot.<br /><br />Don't waste your time or money. However the soundtrack is fantastic. Pick that up instead!<br /><br />(UPDATE)<br />I actually wrote this BEFORE I bought the soundtrack and now...that has let me down as well. I loved most of the music and when I bought the soundtrack, I expected full length versions of all the songs. They aren't. They're just lifted directly from the movie and most of them sound horrible.<br /><br />Avoid it too!
B00104W8T6|5.0|BUY THIS NOW!  This is the best soundtrack produced in decades.  Kimora Dawson (the Antsy Pants & Moldy Peaches) is as always, brilliant. The entire CD is perfectly crafted to fit the tone of the film.     My mom fell in love with it even!  She's 63!
0452289963|5.0|This book is one of the most important books ever written. Why such a bold statement? Are you interested in ending suffering for yourself and for the planet? This book will show you how that can be done. It puts the responsibility for your life where it belongs - on you. The decisions you make on an everyday basis will change yourself and the world. This book gives you what you need to know in order to make the decisions that will promote joy, peace and bliss.
B000006TRV|4.0|Great for what it is... a walk through my pimply teenage years in the late 80s.  What can I say I wanted to re-live that era of my life for a week, then I sold the CD to a re-sale record store.    Excellent just as I remembered, but since I overplayed it in my geeky youth, I felt no need to keep it around from fear that someone might think me a pot-head redneck midwest spaz.    Still, if yer into the Pink.... buy it.
6304712944|5.0|This is the real deal. No other versions of Camelot come close to the original with Richard Harris and cast, and this DVD shows it in glorious color. A winner.
B0002F6AZC|4.0|This is the Divimax edition, which claims to run two minutes longer than the previously released version. Ive yet to find out exactly where the extra two minutes are added, and since i dont own both copies, im at a loss for comparison.     If you like anthology horror, eighties gems, Stephen King, George Romero, and enjoy the classic EC comics or the HBO Tales From The Crypt which were inspired and adapted from the EC comics, then youll like or even love this collection. It contains 3 strange tales: classic honor and revenge story featuring an animated cigar store indian that makes everything right in the end(Chief Woodenhead), rebellious teens who pay for their lack of attention and recklessness - complete with stereotypical drug use, a little full frontal nudity, and a monster that could be the grandson of blob (The Raft), and a cheating wife who accidentally runs over a hitchhiker, picking up his revengeful soul in the process and paying for her sins(The Hitchhiker).    If your standards are over the moon, dont bother with this title. Youll find no olive branches or film festival awards on the cover. What you will find is an hour and a half romp through a peculiar slice of american film making.     After all, isnt horror nothing more than cartoons for grown ups?
B00006CXSS|5.0|This is a great documentary that not only gives you some technical insights it also tells a story and as it does you learn about the real heroes.

Understand the importance of stopping evil leaders sooner rather than later is smarter than waiting for an all out world war.  Often said the greatest generation for good cause.  If you know a war vet or have family that fought in a world war you must get this.    Awesome. A real documentary.
B00026YO36|4.0|Music: 5/10 Vocals: 5/5 Lyrics: 4/5 Production: 4/5  Total: 18 of 25: B-    Mark's vocals can be described as whiskey soaked with a healthy dose of cigarettes and low enough to rattle the floor. He has a truly amazing voice that really is totally unique. So it comes as no surprise that the vocals on Bubblegum are fantastic. Coupled with several duets, including two with PJ Harvey. In fact, those two are excellent songs.    Most of the album focuses on Mark's vocals and leaves the band in the background. One exception is the song \\"Strange Religion\\" which features Izzy Stradlin and Duff McKagan from Guns and Roses fame. But for the rest, the band is secondary which hurts the overall experience. Much of the music is fodder and pap. He even has some fuzzy guitar in a tunnel overtop a drum machine. Ug. Mark can certainly get a better canvas for his voice. The exceptions are the slow and somber duets which Lanegan croons over.    Give Mark a real band and he would be king of the world. Maybe in this new world where the labels aren't as important, perhaps the Screaming Trees can rise again to their former glory. But for now, if you're a Lanegan fan, pick up Bubblegum. There are certainly a handful of great songs. But if you've never heard of him, pass by this album. It's just not good enough.

Chapters include his views on: Republicans & Democrats; Values; Our Constitution; Politics; Opportunity; Faith; Race; The World Beyond Our Borders; & Family. Also helped further my own understanding in these areas. A worthwhile read.

B00004RF9I|5.0|A refreshingly cynical film about the fallout occuring from transitioning the business of journalism to a commoditized commercial interest. A peak experience movie that captures the business of marketing anger, as enabled by the ambitious personalities beholden to nothing but competitive advantage.    The conflict is a struggle of principles for prominence, one that serves the sense of an individual free will against the \\"forces of nature\\" argued as capitalism. The prophet for the humanistic cause makes his choices and the captivated public echoes him enthusiastically whatever his position happens to be. Why? The business of amusement doesn't serve any great human design, only the ceremonious murder of boredom.    There is also a love story, that serves as an excellent compatibility experiment between the old and new. William Holden, our objective old school news executive is loyal to the news and the traditional values, and we see his transformation upon realizations of whether falling for the seductive charms of a mercenary agent of entertainment are really worth the conversion. And what is to be said of this new mercenary, how would she fare having to face the responsibility for genuine human experience? Who, needed whom?    I think my favorite part had to be the legal terms and conditions negotiations between the ecumenical liberation army and the network attorneys over the Mao Tse Tung Hour.    I am amazed at the extent to which the makers of this film demonstrated lucid self awareness with vivid and meaningful representations of the competing ideologies at work. I wonder to what extent the hippy celebrations for the dawning of the age of aquarious mantras had something to do with this film's themes, given its timing and central arguments against the hypocrisy inherent in the new order of things. Many have wondered if the hippy generations really added anything to the American Experience. Perhaps this film could be argued in favor of the cause to expand American awareness through creative license.    I think my review is only about 32 years overdue, however, I just discovered this film a couple of months ago, and to be honest, I was very young when it came out, more captivated by Sesame Street at that point in time.    Altogether a fascinating and intriguing story with brillint dialog, direction, performances and an outstanding story in general. I wonder how the people of Fox News would comment on this film given their current criticims.
B000Q6GUW0|5.0|Dexter is a show about an empty, cold hearted man who leads two separate lives. He's a blood splatter expert for the Miami homicide department by day. But at night, he's a gruesome serial killer who murders his victims by slicing them up, piece by piece. Fair warning--this show is not for the faint of heart. And most of the negative reviews for this series are from people who are offended or disturbed by the gruesome killings that happen on the show. If you don't have a problem with blood and gore, you'll welcome the series with open arms. Dexter is one of the most interesting, unique characters to hit television in years. He's a cold, isolated shell who lives each day trying to be \\"normal\\". He lives by the code of his late foster father, Harry. We witness his to day to day encounters with the people around him--his co-workers, his sister Deb, and his girlfriend Rita. Everyone in Dexter's life contributes to his development into an ordinary man with normal feelings and emotions. The show also delves deep into Dexter's past, uncovering hidden truths and deep dark secrets that help us understand why he has chosen to live the life he leads. There are twists and turns at every corner. Every episode is dark and morbid. The voice overs by Michael C. Hall are clever and witty. The cinematography is morbidly beautiful, and the cast is immensely colorful and talented. This is a brilliant series. Highly recommended!
B00006LIRI|5.0|I give Island and Interscope both pointers for assembling this U2 collection. The single-disc 'The Best of 1990-2000' was released in 2002 as a follow up to 1998's 'The Best of 1980-1990.' The compilation covers the period very well, spanning 1991's 'Achtung Baby' to 2000's 'All That You Can't Leave Behind,' you get a great retrospective of the period.    Unlike the previous, you get almost every major hit from the period here. 'Even Better Than The Real Thing,' 'Mysterious Ways,' 'The First Time' and 'Beautiful Day' all appear on this set. And, the sound quality is excellent!    But, just like 1980-1990, there is plenty missing. Where is 'Lemon,' 'Zoo Station,' 'Elevation,' 'Walk On' and 'If God Will Send His Angels'? And, why is every song from 1997's 'Pop' remixed? I LOVE the remixes, but why not put one song from the underrated masterpiece in it's album format?    Overall, this is a worthy buy for the casual U2 fan. I have really enjoyed this CD, and casual fans will too.    Highly recommended for any U2 fan. ENJOY!!!
B000002UJQ|5.0|This album is amazing. i would say this would be the hit album of 97'. all the songs are AMAZING!!!  Every song is downright awesome. Any body who does not have this album, buy it and you will enjoy the amazing experience of radiohead....       you rock radiohead!!!!!
B000002J1U|5.0|This record is simply breathtaking. It is one of Led Zeppelin's finest releases ever made. Robert Plant's vocals on this record are raw and unique, and Jimmy Page plays every type of guitar possible on this record, from electric to acoustic to slide to mandolin, and John Paul Jones and John Bonham also shine on this record.    Overall, if you like Zeppelin or classic rock, than you MUST have this record. Every single song on this record was very important to Zep's career, especially 'Immigrant Song,' 'Gallows Pole,' 'Tangerine,' and the bluesy 'Since I've Been Loving You.'    If you've never heard it, listen to 'Friends' and 'Celebration Day.' On the record, 'Friends' goes launches right into 'Celebration Day.' They are practically one song. I can't listen to one without the other, to be honest.    'That's The Way' and 'Bron-Y-Aur Stomp' are other great highlights that would become concert classics for the group. 'Hats of To (Roy) Harper' is another great song well worth listening to. Page's slide guitar and Plant's unique voice prove to be the perfect combo on this track.    Overall, highly recommended for any Zep fan. ENJOY!!!
B00024I2Z4|5.0|this movie is a cross-cultural classic, the story is great, the songs are wonderful, everyone should have one of this
B00000DCHD|4.0|This is one of my favorite Billy Joel albums.  It's a hell of a follow up to The Stranger (his first massive hit), and in some ways, I think it's better.  It has more memorable songs, it's more mature, and it has a real edge to it.  The opener, Big Shot, is a great opener, with a killer guitar riff and some of Billy's most pointed lyrics.  It's not Idiot Wind, but it's still damn good.  My Life is an excellent single, one that doesn't wear itself out.  I've always dug the song Stiletto.  It's got a cruel, bluesy vibe to it, and has some excellent piano work by Joel.  But the best song is the penultimate song, Until the Night.  It's one of Joel's most underrated and moving songs.  It sounds like a breakup song, but it could be a song about getting back together.  His vocal is one of the most impassioned ones he's ever had.  Overall, this is a great album in a string of great albums by Billy Joel.
160459201X|5.0|I've always thought a book was worth reading if you could walk away with 2 or 3 good ideas that you can apply to your life.  Well this book has so many ideas, that it is a must have so it can be read over and over to help retain all of its ideas.  I highly recommend this book.
B00081U7HC|3.0|They definitely did not take much time putting this together.  There are no interviews with the actors.  I think Julia Roberts is fabulous but can't help but think she and Richard Geere are too big to take the time to add something special to this 15th Anniversary edition.
B000ZLFALI|1.0|I believe that there are two kinds of people who will like this movie: teenagers who are desperate to find some kind of meaningful rebellion in their own lives (and earn themselves a tragic love story in the process), and people who thrive on pretension like plants thrive on sunlight.  In fact, I am convinced it was a team of these types of people who made this horrible movie in the first place.    The story centers on Jude and Lucy, who, at the beginning of the movie, are both saying goodbyes to that special someone in their lives: Jude, to his girlfriend, as he is going to America; Lucy, to her boyfriend who is shipping off to Vietnam.  Jude tells his girlfriend that he will \\"alway be true\\" (SLEDGEHAMMER OF FORESHADOWING), as Lucy's boyfriend assures her he will return from the war unscathed (ICE PICK OF FORESHADOWING APPLIED DIRECTLY TO THE CRANIUM WITH MAXIMUM FORCE).    Jude comes to America in search of his biological father, who is a custodian at Princeton.  Once Jude finds his father, there's a heartwarming reunion, right?  Nope, his father serves as the excuse for Jude to meet Max, a soon-to-be college drop-out and Lucy's brother.    Of course Lucy and Jude meet and fall in love while interacting with various characters who flit in and out of the story for seemingly no reason except to inspire Beatles puns (Oh, look, there's Prudence the lesbian who \\"came in through the bathroom window!\\", and the \\"Sexy\\" singer, Sadie!) or to tie in events that otherwise would not directly affect the characters already represented (Jojo, the black guitarist, becomes important only when the screenwriters want to shoehorn \\"black\\" events into the script, like the Detroit riots and the death of Dr. Martin Luther King).    There is very little plot.  Events are barely strung together (\\"Dear Prudence\\" sung as a plaintive ode to the forlorn character of the same name, a psychedelic road trip that ends at a Terry Gilliam-esque circus for no apparent reason, a bar room concert that is possibly the least frenetic and seizure inducing bit of the whole film), before Max is shipped off to Vietnam and Lucy, fearing he will meet the same fate as her brother, becomes radically political while Jude immerses himself in his art.  They grow apart, but the viewer finds it difficult to really care, as the only indication given that they are in any sort of relationship is the fact that they gaze soulfully at each other and float nearly nude in a watery blue void.      Of course it all ends Happily Ever After (tm).  Or not.  The viewer doesn't know, as the film closes with Lucy standing on an adjacent rooftop, again gazing soulfully toward Jude.  Her pout is indiscernible, but the music crescendos to let the audience know that they have just experienced some deep universal truth.  The rest of characters' stories are left unresolved as well, unless the viewer wishes to take the time to create their endings for them.    That's one of the main problems with the movie.  It assumes that you will make the connections of the plot yourself.  One moment, Prudence is locked in the closet.  The next, the characters are bumping into her by surprise at the psychedelic circus, where she has seemingly been working for a while.  Jude believes something tragic has happened to Lucy, but he seeks her out without the viewers being shown how his misconception has been cleared up in the first place.  The film is content to careen on from concept to concept without the messy legwork of logistics and plot development.    The biggest crime perpetrated by this film and its makers is the outright abuse of the Beatles catalog.  Fans of the Beatles music (that is to say, fans who did not come into familiarity with the material through this movie alone) know that each song has a context in the vast Beatles mythology, a context which the filmmakers merrily toss aside in favor of bending the pieces to fit their trite version of a love story.  In the worst of cases, lyrics are interpreted literally, making them absurd (underwear clad soldiers march across a miniature Vietnam carrying the Statue of Liberty on their backs while grunting \\"She's So Heavy\\").  Other songs, such as \\"Helter Skelter\\" and \\"While My Guitar Gently Weeps\\" are used to illustrate events that have no correlation to their meaning.    I would like to say that the cast does what they can with the shoddy material they were given to act, but that would be a lie.  They do what they can with the mediocre talent they were given.  Evan Rachel Wood spends much of the movie gazing deeply at things with a pained expression.    Jim Sturgess veers between incorrigible school boy and wounded puppy.  Joe Anderson manages to inject some depth into Max, but he's mostly upstaged by the absolutely asinine dance sequences he's surrounded by in the recruitment office and VA hospital.  Dana Fuchs rasps and vamps her way through the movie as if she's auditioning for a Janis Joplin bio-pic.     It boggles my mind that anyone could give this atrocious film a positive review of any kind.  When I left the theatre, I demanded my money back.  Then I was reminded it was a free screening and, as I could not get the moments of my life back that I lost while watching \\"Across The Universe\\", I feel I deserve to have my memory erased as a fair trade.    \\"Across The Universe\\" is the perfect movie for anyone who felt that \\"Forrest Gump\\" was too in-depth and realistic in its portrayal of the events of the sixties.  Anyone with an appreciation of acting, character and plot development and respect to historical events will just be disappointed.
B00104QSOM|3.0|I paid my hard earned money to see this at the theater and was more than a bit disappointed.  It really tries to be something that it isnt, and that is an art house epic.  I wonder sometimes if the hollywood moguls dont just spin a wheel of names and whomever it lands on becomes the \\"genius\\" of the year... it seems that way sometimes.        I really think that the thing that threw some folks off in thinking that this is some sort of high brow art flick was the grating horror score that was seemingly thrown in wherever and whenever.        I certainly couldnt see a decent plot inwhich to create a film around.. so one would simply think this a character study.  the only problem is that the only \\"human\\" charater in this whole film is the main character played brilliantly by Dan Lewis.  Lewis tried his very best like he always does. and the fact that he accomplished what he did with what he had to work with certainly earned him that oscar (thats why i gave it 3 stars).  Although, you cant help but see a very overt resemblence between this character and Bill the Butcher from The Gangs of New York. Really, if he wouldve slapped on a stove pipe top hat and started sharpening a knife one couldnt have told the difference.  I dont think that was Lewis's fault at all. he was most likely pushed to perform in that way by the \\"genius of the month\\" director.  another positive in this pic is the cinematography and lighting, which im sure is why some think it a great pic.  The photography is done really well, and obviously the director of cinematography was the true genius behind this film, as well as the editor.  but lewis, photography, and editing, no matter how good, cannot save a picture that was badly written, and is filled with 2 dimensional characters (some so laughable that its almost sickening.. or so sickening that its almost laughable).       that said, youre not wrong for likeing this movie anymore than youre wrong for liking the color green; different strokes for different folks where art is concerned.  I may view this movie again 2 years from now and think its great, thats just how things are.  but right now i really cant see what others are seeing in this particular film.        Another thing i really didnt like about this pic was the ending. it just seemed so silly and pointless,like the punchline to a really long and stupid joke.  people complained about the ending of \\"no country for old men\\", which I didnt understand at first.  but I think that \\"blood's\\" ending summed up the entire content of the film much more masterfully than \\"no country's\\" ending did for its own content... and that summation would have to be summed up in one word, 'silly'.        netflix this bugger before you buy it, and watch it more than once. because, like i wrote before.. i could be wrong.   enjoy!    BTW: if you want to see a true artistic film that tackles the insanity and meaninglessness of the age old, and continueing, problem of violence; pick up \\"no country for old men\\". its also a true and masterfully made and acted character study. PRIMO STUFF!!!
0751532711|1.0|In this book, Kiyosaki does a good job of \\"motivating\\" naive and inexperienced investors into believing that investing is easy and that \\"money for nothing\\" is your entitlement as an American. Indeed, apparently only the \\"rich\\" have figured this out and the poor and middle class remain consigned to exploited ignorance.    This is a false, misleading, and dangerous view of the world. Making money is not easy, and indeed often entails huge amounts of risk when investing and leverage is involved (as a lot of naive real estate investors are now figuring out the hard way with house prices collapsing). There is usually nothing wrong with motivating people, but where peoples' money and livelihoods are at stake, providing false and misleading motivational material is extremely dangerous, and can lead to people taking on huge risks they can't afford, and/or mislead them away from pursuing a promising career to which they may well be suited.    Yes, saving money and learning how to invest it sensibly is a way to accumulate wealth over time, but it takes a lot of hard work, sacrifice, and the wealth accumulation is naturally very slow and entails risks (both in real estate and stocks). The type of real estate deals RK discusses which imply the possibility of making large amounts of money with little time/money/risk is simply a fantasy and could end up costing you everything.    Starting a successful business can be more rewarding than a job but it entails greater risks and not everyone is suited to building a successful business and most will fail. For many people a job is a more logical, low risk option, and in several fields there are opportunities to earn good money over time from professional development.
1400063515|4.0|Not for some time has a book affected my thinking as much as this one.  Taleb's self-described \\"personal essay\\" is way too long and sometimes a little too angry, but his exposition of the flaws in our thinking has provided a new and useful lens for much of my own thinking.  One salient example is the narrative fallacy: \\"our predilection for compact stories over raw truths\\" (p63).  We tend to assign causes and reasons for events even when we lack any evidence of connections: We want to tell stories.  Many of these stories are harmless, but others can keep us from being open to truth when it appears.      A second example is the problem of silent evidence: If one uses worshippers who prayed and survived a subsequent shipwreck as evidence of the efficacy of prayer, an observer might ask, What of those who prayed and then drowned?  \\"The drowned worshippers, being dead, would have a lot of trouble advertising their experiences from the bottom of the sea\\" (p100).  It's not that I've never noticed these fallacies before, but having a name for them makes them much easier to identify.  These points and many more like them make this volume a worthy read.    The titular Black Swans are events with three characteristics: (1) they are outside of regular expectations because nothing in the past convincingly points to their possibility, (2) they carry an extreme impact, and (3) they are explainable and predictable after the fact although not before (p. xvii-xviii).  Taleb argues that many modern phenomena, including the distribution of wealth (Bill Gates's income), book and movie success (the Da Vinci Code), and mortality in modern warfare (to name a few) are subject to Black Swan events.  Many natural and historical phenomena (such as the distribution of human heights or mortality in traditional warfare) are not as subject to Black Swans.    None of the standard statistical tools used for analysis in finance, economics, and social sciences are capable of accounting for Black Swans, making them - according to Taleb - worse than worthless, as they give a false sense of knowledge and security.  (For example, he demonstrates how wildly erroneous financial projections unfailingly are and asks why these are useful.)    Taleb makes his point in thirty different ways, gives his personal history, insults economists repeatedly, and creates a number of hypothetical characters.  He sometimes expounds too informally given the paradigm-shifting point he is trying to make, but overall the book has much to offer.  He outlines a whole host of psychological biases and reasoning fallacies (beyond the two I mentioned above) that affect our thinking and predicting, often blinding us to the possibility of black swans.    Most of the book is non-technical [not that I'm the best judge of that, with an advanced economics degree], but a few chapters towards the end get into more technical detail: Taleb warns us in advance.    I listened to the unabridged audiobook narrated by David Chandler [12 CDs], published by Recorded Books.  The narration is very good (with the exception that the narrator always pronounces foreign names with a little pause and a flare, like it's a separate performance; but that's a small and entertaining flaw).    [Note on content: The book uses strong language a handful of times.]
B0011HOEY4|4.0|\\"American Gangster\\" comes thisclose to being a classic film of it's type.  Washington and Crowe are terrific.  Ruby Dee takes advantage of her small role and shows what acting is all about.  But... and this is a BIG BUT, the DVD's quality is horrible.  It's hard to watch this movie and not constantly say to yourself... somebody screwed up here!  Both the dull look of this movie on DVD, and a soundtrack that is often subpar make me  wonder what the heck happened?
B00000IBVC|5.0|I wish reviewers would review the product at hand without comparing to other recorded versions. No singer or opera performance is similar and should be reviewed based on it's sole merits alone. Larin is not Corelli, Casolla is not Nilsson and Frittoli is not Moffo. Just think how boring opera would be if every singer and opera performance was exactly the same. As a Chinese-American, I thoroughly enjoyed this lavish performance. From the Chinese perspective, it is a great honor that a magnificent composer such as Puccini would have been enthralled with our culture to write Turandot. To bring Turandot home to Beijing is an honor long overdue. Of course for such an important homecoming, Zhang Yimou, the greatest director in China would be asked to direct and produce the event. In a culture where face (honor) is so important, should it be surprising that the Chinese would spare no expense in recreating such lavish costumes, and scenery, etc.? This was a chance for China to showcase herself and her grand culture. The Chinese government is very selective about whom is allowed to film inside this amazing symbol of imperialism. I only state the above so viewers can better understand why certain scenes like martial arts (wushu - acrobatic style) are included. I can hardly wait for the opening Beijing Olympics ceremony. Also, Frittoli's slave attire may seem too fancy for some reviewers. However, servants of wealthy families were well dressed because they accompanied their masters into public. Now for the reviewer that called this a second rate cast, I disagree. Just because they do not have famous names does not mean they are not great singers. Those who can DO, those who cannot criticize. Larin is a wonderful tenor, but he does not seem to act at all. Casolla has a steely voice just perfect for the role of ice princess. Frittoli is again magnificent. Her voice is warm and golden in tone. She's a fine actress too. Mehta is in fine form directing the Orchestra & Chorus of Maggio Musicale Florentino.   I think Zhang Yimou is a genius and have enjoyed all of his films. The production and background are visually gorgeous. The costumes were unbelievable and I greatly enjoyed having real Chinese in the cast. A very worthy Turandot!
0739366416|1.0|Anyone who is young, energetic and smart has a great advantage to become an idol in American presidential election. But Obama seems to be only a FAKE. He fakes everything, he mimid and copied big politicians but has very little of his own. But that is not the worst, he is trying to hide his Muslim past and pretend that he is mainstream Christian which he is not. Why he never talked about his visit to Odinga in Kenya only two years ago who is his close personal friend, and has since been killing thousands of Christians in Kenya, whose aim to overthrown the elected Kenya government and turn that country into a Muslim one? Can any Christian recite passage from Koran with Arabic? That has Obama done in a interview with New York Times in 2006. Don't believe this man. He is only a fake. (Fox News, great journalists such as Judi McLeod, Jon Christian Ryter, etc have all been reporting or writing about this man. Read for yourself.)

B0010YSD7M|2.0|After a year of waiting, a very disappointing 90-minute episode entitled ARK OF TRUTH is released with a $20 price tag.    I had expected the entire story to be devoted to the end of the Ori, but you will find only half the movie covering their final demise.  The other half resurrects an old villian from Stargate's past.  So what we end up with is a quick conclusion to the Ori storyline which ends exactly the same way as the Anubus storyline ended.  The rest of the movie has battle scenes we've seen before in many past episodes as they fight the old villian from their past.  And we also get a fight scene with Cameron against an unbeatable foe very similar to the Black Knight he fought in the Camelot episode.  Rent it before buying!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1563898586|4.0|Great literary characters have a tendency to outlive their mortal creators, by finding second and third lives in cultures far removed from those which created them. Here, in the first volume of a collection of graphic novels, a quintet of Victorian-era protagonists are enjoyably thrust into the late-20th-century medium of the comic book.<br /><br />It is 1898. Mina Murray, heroine of \\"Dracula\\" with her maiden name reassumed, is charged to assemble a team of social miscreants whose skills are badly needed by the British Empire, confronting a mysterious menace from within. Captain Nemo (Jules Verne's \\"20,000 Leagues Under The Sea\\") brings his submarine \\"Nautilus\\", while Robert Louis Stevenson's Dr. Henry Jekyll contributes his unrestrained alter-ego Mr. Hyde. H.G. Wells' \\"Invisible Man\\" is somewhere on hand, too, and then there's Allan Quatermain, legendary African explorer from the H. Rider Haggard stories.<br /><br />One of the most notable aspects of this book, a collection of six sequentially-issued comic books published in 2000, is its treatment of Quatermain, least notable of the main characters, as its central figure. Aged, strung out from drugs, somewhat blinkered in his attitudes, he represents the guiding spirit of the era in all its good and bad ways and something of a pin cushion for writer Alan Moore's modernist barbs. At the same time, underneath the action and bloodshed, it is Quatermain's redemption as a full-blooded hero that propels this story out from the chapbook and comics milieu it cheerfully inhabits.<br /><br />Between the chapter sections lie warnings of what lies ahead: \\"Mothers of sensitive or neurasthenic children may wish to examine the contents before passing it on to their little one, removing those pages which they consider to be unsuitable.\\" Moore is described in a brief bio, written in the same tone, as the author of such prior works as \\"A Child's Garden of Venereal Horrors\\" and \\"Cocaine and Rowing: The Sure Way to Health.\\"<br /><br />There is some truth to the warning regarding sensitive offspring.

B000R4SMCW|4.0|\\"Fracture\\" trods upon very familiar ground for mystery lovers; a genius (Anthony Hopkins) plans and executes the 'Perfect Crime', and it's up to a young 'blue collar but upwardly mobile' D.A. (Ryan Gosling), to find the flaw, and bring him to justice. Despite a somewhat flat finale (the flaw should be obvious, if you are observant), the performances are so good that the film is a genuinely entertaining noir.<br /><br />Hopkins' on-screen persona is so well established, at this point in his career, that his back-story as a brilliant, charming psychopath requires little screen time. A scene showing his authority at work, another of him spying on his much younger wife (Embeth Davidtz) enjoying an indiscretion at a motel, and his confrontation with the cheating spouse, ending with a bullet in her head, just seems 'natural'. Of course, this is just the framework to a scheme that will also destroy her lover, and humiliate the police and judicial system, while he smiles and taunts Gosling. Nobody 'taunts' better than Hopkins, and his genteel superiority and cockiness is great fun to watch!<br /><br />Gosling's role is far more complex, and isn't helped by an abrupt reversal of his morality that is poorly written, but he does a remarkable job. A country boy, complete with a southern twang, he disguises a self-centered ruthlessness with an off-handed charm. With a 97% conviction rate (achieved by passing 'no-win' cases off to others), he coldly breaks an agreement with a defense counsel to win a big case, resulting in a job offer from the prestigious firm he'd just defeated. He is on the fast track, a fact he plays to the hilt, as he serves his notice to the D.A.'s office, is introduced into the world of 'big fees', and seduces his mentor (Rosamund Pike, sporting a perfect American accent). Reluctantly,  he agrees to one last assignment, the arraignment of Hopkins...which will knock his well-laid plans completely off-kilter, as his involvement is a key element in Hopkin's scheme.<br /><br />While there are obvious plot-holes (how could Hopkins be certain Gosling would be the DA assigned to the case?), the cat-and-mouse duel between the adversaries is a joy, with two actors at the top of their game.<br /><br />\\"Fracture\\" isn't a great film, but it is involving, and Hopkins and Gosling's performances give it an extra 'star' in my rating!here are obvious plot-holes (how could Hopkins be certain Gosling would be the DA assigned to the case?), the cat-and-mouse duel between the adversaries is a joy, with two actors at the top of their game.     \\"Fracture\\" isn't a great film, but it is involving, and Hopkins and Gosling's performances give it an extra 'star' in my rating!

If you've read the previous book this will add to the experience and will give you insight in some new sectors the theory of constraints can be applied to.<br /><br />It is not hard to read any of the books by Goldratt, as they read like a business novel. However, it will make you think about certain processes like it's the one million dollar one. That's what makes this series good; motivational writing and plain problem solving. Hey, who didn't like puzzles when they were kids?<br /><br />Liked the first one? Then get this one, as it is the second best of the series.

It does give manager some valuable insights which were missing in the previous books and is still fun to read and maybe it makes me long for not having read the previous books yet...
0307237702|5.0|first, let me share where i come from.  while i feel some fiscal conservative bias, i am socially very liberal.  i have visited senator obama's web site for presidency.  i read this book already \\"sold\\" on the man, to some extent, but i wanted or needed to explore more of who he is and what makes him tick.  those 15 second sound bites or even the 15 minute speeches haven't been enough ...    obama writes this book in a first person narrative.  he writes extremely well, appropriate for a man once [was it] editor of harvard's law review, both grammatically but also in a style that pulls the reader in.  you feel like you're sitting on your sofa talking with him.  while he sometimes goes on tangents explaining the background of a point, sometimes consuming a page or so for background, by the time you're brought back, you feel fully prepared and invested in the original point.      obama introduces himself to the public.  i can see in his writing, as in some of his speeches, that he is extremely particular and diplomatic in selecting diction, for whatever reason.  while he does not lay out a timeline of his life nor does he address some of his strengths and weaknesses addressed in other media more fully, you obtain an excellent sampling of obama's experiences to feel that you understand his judgment, his skills, his knowledge.    obama also writes about several things that seem to be of importance to much of the american public today.  he lays out historical and current factors affecting his faith.  having studied international relations at columbia university, he proffers insights into america's squandering of its support from key foreign allies, into some of the challenges that america faces in the coming decades, and he tenders possible avenues for addressing those opportunities.    you know, by the end of the book, i was feeling, quite strongly, hopeful.  i felt as though the challenges that we are now facing, with two wars - one of which was based on misleading information to the congress and the american public, a failed energy policy resulting in record high gasoline prices, domestic terrorism and prevention, deteriorating infrastructure, misguided economic investments and objectives resulting in record deficits or cascading housing market and value of the dollar, job losses and replacement of good paying jobs with lower paid jobs, immigration issues, healthcare uninsured and costs and quality, medicare and social security and economic implosion, threats to our civil liberties, all children left behind, ...  there's lots of things facing our country today that we didn't even have names for 2 decades ago ...  obama describes some of what he has done, drafting bills, reviewing legislation, voting up or down or proposed legislation, investigating issues, listening to voters, seeking counsel of experts, crafting of bipartisan legislation, and using sound judgment and emotional processes.  by the end of the book, i really see much of his skills and potential.      one of the gifts that ronald reagan brought to this country, obama argues, was hope to a nation that had been stuck in [a purple funk] since watergate just a few years earlier [1973].   you see that, today, as in 1980, the american public feels fear, feels desperation, and is grasping for hope.  obama offers the reader hope in this book.      266-ish pages is decent size to get to know the man a bit better.  i've devoured all six volumes of churchill's masterpiece, so, i hope that this book is just the beginning and i can learn more of obama and the challenges he faces and overcomes.  i look forward to seeing and reading more of this fine gentleman in years to come.
B000WZAE1I|5.0|Stardust is an extremely charming and very entertaining film, full of humor, action and adventure, a kingdom to be won, evil witches to overcome, magic, and, of course, love, true love.  It is a wonderful fantasy that gently envelops you, draws you in, and leaves you feeling happy and satisfied.  Narrated by Sir Ian McKellen, his serene and dulcet tones set the mood perfectly.<br /><br />All the actors give top-notch performances, from the stars, to the supporting cast, and onward to the cameos.  Claire Danes is simply lovely in the lead role, playing the fallen star with innocence, grace, and a special \\"luminosity.\\"  Charlie Cox is a likeable, sweet, yet bumbling oaf who transforms into the perfect knight in shining armor.  Michelle Pfeiffer is wonderfully wicked and evil.  Peter O'Toole has a brief appearance as the dying king, lending, as always, a touch of class.<br /><br />And then there is Robert DeNiro.  Not wanting to give it away, this is a DeNiro never before seen.  He is brilliant, outrageous, and fun. Bravo.<br /><br />Also worthy of note, is the peanut gallery of ghosts (i.e., the dead sons of the king), who's numbers continually increase.  Their running commentary adds fun and amusement throughout the film.  It is a clever touch.<br /><br />To the last detail, this film has it all.  The lush settings and scenery are exquisite. The special effects are outstanding. The score fits the film and the action to a tee.<br /><br />I highly recommend this film.  Like The Princess Bride before it, Stardust is destined to become a classic.  You will not be disappointed.
B0002IQNAG|5.0|DAWN OF THE DEAD is a classic in the HORROR genre and I just had to watch<br />this again last night.  I love this movie true the zombies look fake<br />especially when compared to Fulci's classic ZOMBIE but WHO CARES!!!<br />We have a story with characters that I found myself caring about<br />a great script and find directing. Sir Romero has always been great at<br />adding humor to his HORROR and D.O.T.D. is no exception from the beginning<br />we have chaos for the entire United States is being plagued by zombies<br />and the few humans that are alive must leave but to where???<br />Our four heroes steal a helicopter and find a abandon shopping mall.<br />We are already 20 min. into the movie but this is where it starts for<br />me for this is where I found myself caring about the four stars and hoping they all make it alive(which is unusual for your buddy Clint<br />for normally I say LET THEM DIE!) When two of our heroes GET IT<br />so to speak I was angry!  The way this movie builds up and ends<br />was funtastic(sic) and I am truly glad to have in my HORROR COLL.<br />If you are not big on GORE(shame on you) than please stay away<br />however if you can handle heads chopped off by helicopter,limbs<br />being eaten and children being blown away by a machine gun than<br />by all means watch DAWN of the DEAD for it is ONE of our greatest<br />HORROR films especially for 78(the awesome HALLOWEEN and INVASION of the<br />BODY SNATCHERS also came out this year) the ultimate edition is the<br />only way to go on this flick for it has in depth views on the making<br />and of course all three versions of the film(I prefer the extended<br />version myself Romero's dir.cut is 2nd and you can have the awful<br />Dario Argento cut LOVE YA DARIO STILL) anyway if you love HORROR<br />DAWN of the DEAD is a must!!!

I don't write reviews, but this one was worth writing for.   I don't watch movies twice, but I'll buy and watch and share this one many times.   Even though I already knew the ending, and I thought it wouldn't get me... It did!   I'm 40 something and loved it just as much as my 20 something yoga instructor, who said everyone needs to see it.
B0010YSD7M|2.0|I bought this movie with high hopes that the writers, producers, and directors would take the direct to dvd movie series to the next level, beyond the television series - and was severely disappointed. There was very little in this dvd that felt like a movie, with the exception of 1 or 2 cuss words (rather contrived way to separate the movie from the tv show), and the opening sequence which did have a broad, sweeping feel to it.    There were 2 other scenes which felt \\"larger\\" than a tv episode - one we had seen in the trailers (where the production company spent most of the 7 million dollar budget on special effects) as the ship moves through the SuperGate. The other is Teal'c journey across miles of beautiful and breathtaking terrain to find the rest of his team.    But none of that was nearly enough to sway my overall opinion of this stretched out episdoe.    If you are a Cam Mitchell fan, buy the movie. If you enjoy movies with over extended battle and fight scenes - and I mean scenes that NEVER seem to end, buy the movie.    However, if you are expecting to see a movie with a storyline that is full of character development and interaction between the leads, give this one a big MISS.    The plot holes in this story are large enough to drive a Mack Truck through.  The largest one, Teal'c wakes up after being shot in a fight and knows - precisely - which direction to take to find the rest of the team?  Even though they have been carted miles and miles away?  I found myself actually exclaiming outloud - what a Load! during that scene. The Jaffa suddenly has esp or something? Is this some sort of side effect of long term exposure to Tretonin?  Whatever.    I had hoped to see something that felt more like a movie and less like an episode - but should have known better when the same people who wrote, directed, and produced the series worked on this project and the next upcoming direct to DVD movie - Continuum. Even with Richard Dean Anderson's appearance in that film,I will most likely rent it before I buy it in an attempt to avoid a $19.99 mistake.
B00005OMTT|4.0|I have long been a fan of Michael Cretu's breakaway music format and it is always a breath of fresh of air. It's always good to listen to Enigma when hit with the intensity of today's music scene.<br />The playlist is pretty much on par on what I would have expected from a compilation.<br />BUT! Where is \\"The Child In Us\\" (from their juggernaut 3:LE ROI EST MORT, VIVE LE ROI! album)? It is by far Enigma's most inspirational song. This album missed the boat 18 times to put this masterpiece of recording on the album. To me, \\"The Child In Us\\" in a nutshell represents what the Enigma project aimed to do. It may sound like I'm finding some way to nitpick, but that song *has* to be on the album for it to be \\"Greatest Hits\\".<br />My advice is to buy the digital download of this album and then buy the MP3 of \\"The Child In Us\\" And burn yourself a master CD of this compilation. Then it will truly be Enigma's \\"Greatest Hits\\".

B0012K1ILW|1.0|Okay Seriously!!!! This album sucks big time. I told my sister not to get the album but she got it anyway because she thought the song \\"Honey\\" was on it. Well, when we got in the car and listened to it, we both had a frown on our faces. First off, how are you gonna come out with a single and the song is not even on the album? We thought maybe it was a typo and they forgot to list it, so we skipped over the songs and to our dismay the song was not on there. We listened a few mins to the other songs and it was just downright terrible. We have decided to send this album back to the record company and tell them to take this album and shove it. Erykah, this is the worst album you have ever recorded. I'm sticking with the first album Baduism.

Maybe I have outgrown him - outgrown the genre, but really, this was a snore right from the start.  Because 'The King' wrote it, I gave it try after try, but just could not get interested in the main character - could care about her (ongoing...and ongoing...) inner conflict or ramblings.  Pass this one up or get it for your collection maybe.  He's done much better work and I am hoping he does so again, but I haven't been happy with the latest offerings.  I actually thought he was lending his name to some student writer - it was that bad.

0141439580|5.0|The title character of \\"Emma\\" is unique among the heroines of Jane Austen's novels.  She is \\"handsome, clever, and rich\\" and at twenty-one years of age, inexperienced in life.  Further, for most of the novel, Emma is not actively seeking a husband.  The grim economic necessity that made finding the right husband so important for Lizzie Bennet and her counterparts in the other novels does not apply.  Emma can therefore be allowed to be foolish in her social forays, even to fail, without impairing the audience's ability to enjoy the resulting romantic comedy.<br /><br />Emma lives at the estate of Hartfield with her doting but hypochondriac father.  Their social status as the leading family of Highbury is unquestioned.  The recent marriage of Emma's governess to a close neighbor prompts Emma to wish to arrange suitable matches for her other friends and neighbors.  Her immediate target is Harriet Smith, an amiable young woman of uncertain social status.  Against the advice of Emma's brother-in-law and confidant Mr. Knightley, Emma persuades Miss Smith to refuse an offer of marriage from a Mr. Martin, a upright hardworking farmer of no social distinction.  Emma then tries to match Harriet up with the ambitious young vicar of Highbury, Mr. Elton.  This scheme fails, hilariously, when Mr. Elton proposes instead to a horrified Emma.<br /><br />Mr. Elton soon brings a new Mrs. Elton to the village, a vulgar social upstart who presumes to arrange the social life of Highbury.  Among her targets is young Jane Fairfax, once the paid companion of a gentlewoman, now forced to make her own way.  The arrival of the charming and handsome Frank Churchill creates additional complications.  Emma, after getting over her own initial infatuation, presses a match between Frank and Miss Smith.  She is also provoked by Frank into passing rumors about Jane Fairfax and the husband of the woman she formerly accompanied.  The climax of the story may be an unfortunate picnic at Box Hill, where everyone seems out of sorts.  Emma thoughtlessly insults the silly but harmless Miss Bates, for which she is very properly upbraided by Mr. Knightley.  Emma then learns, in rapid succession, that Frank has been engaged to Jane Fairfax all along and that Harriet believes she has gained the affection of Mr. Knightley.  Emma is mortified to have misjudged both Frank and Jane, and to have inadvertantly pushed Harriet towards a man she now realizes she loves herself.<br /><br />Emma must take responsibility for her mistakes and make good her relationships with Miss Bates, Jane Fairfax, and Harriet Smith.  Her fear of losing Mr. Knightley leads to a fateful conversation with him in the garden of Hartfield, in which Emma's fear of losing his friendship works at cross-purposes with Mr. Knightley's real agenda.<br /><br />Austen's subtle and witty exploration of social relationships in \\"Emma\\" is both humorous and insightful.  \\"Emma\\" is the least heroic of Austen's heroines, but her undoubted charm and her very human efforts to mature have endeared her to generations of readers.  \\"Emma\\" is very highly recommended to fans of Jane Austen's novels as perhaps her most polished romantic comedy.ut of sorts.

The story is gently comic, the pictures are full of clever detail, the colors are beautiful, and the animals look so sweet it's always a pleasure.  My son, who is eight months old, crows with delight every time we reach the page where all the animals say \\"goodnight\\" in black and white and in all different sizes.  It's nice too, because with so little written dialogue, you get to tell the story in your own words.  A classic in the making.

Solid baseball, great baseball reading and no snow.    Others have gone into great detail, so I will make my review short.  I have a new found respect for the A's, Billy Beane & Paul DePodesta.  They have taken baseball to a new level and built some great teams.  The White Sox now have Beane favorite Nick Swisher, but in return Beane extracted solid pitching prospects from the Sox organization.    If you love baseball read this book.  You won't regret it.    Finally, as I have suspected for a long time, ESPN analyst & baseball hall of famer Joe Morgan is truly nothing but a gas bag.  Good player, but a worthless analyst.

B000XCZGVI|5.0|I can clearly remember living in the San Francisco Bay Area during the days when the Zodiac was active.  I was very diligent about locking doors, and I frequently looked over my shoulder.  When the book was published, I read it with great interest.  The book was well written, and in fact I re-read it after meeting a couple of the detectives that worked on the case.  The movie was an excellent companion to the book.  I found the acting credible, the music true to the period, and it certainly recreated a scary time.  I was concerned that the movie might be a horror story rip-off of the book, but it was not.  It was more a combination documentary/detective story and well worth my time.  As is generally the case, the HD DVD provides the experience that resembles the theater experience.  Highly recommended
B000EZ913I|2.0|Notorious Byrd Brothers is a great record, though as Mr Goodwin notes, the recording is kind of muddy.  I  bought this SACD recording on Mr Goodwin's recommendation.  He will not want to meet me for a few weeks.  The Mobile Fidelity SACD issue is frankly no better in any way than the Columbia Legacy stereo mix. And if you can hear any difference between the mono and Stereo mixes, then you are concentrating 100% on every note being played, and probably being victimized by your imagination. The cover says the record is SACD. So you should expect a better quality of sound on SACD equipment.  NOPE. That is not what you get.  On my SACD Pioneer player, the \\"SACD\\" sound is no better than the Columbia Legacy issue.  A mono mix that is really the same as the stereo.  And a sound that SACD did not improve.  And an attractive cover. That is what you get when you buy this.

The date had been pushed back to 2007, then 2008 and as you might have guessed now 2009. By the time the movie comes out I will be as clueless as everyone else in the audience because I will have forgotten the ending. But for those of you who have not had the pleasure, I definitely recommend the read. It goes by so fast! The plot (A young girl who was brutally raped and murdered, watches the effects of her death on her family from Heaven, as her parents drift apart, her father becomes obsessed with vengeance and her sister grows into the woman she would never be) may sound a bit macabre but intriguing none-the-less. I'm also very interested in how Peter Jackson will cinematize this novel. An actress from my current favorite movie \\"Atonement\\" will be playing the lead- Suzie. Thank god Hollywood did not break down and default Dakota Fanning in this role as I feared they might. I really liked Saorise Ronan's performance in Atonement and think she would make a *perfect* Suzie.  'Kathleen Dougherty  [...]
067003830X|5.0|This is one of those books which you have to read in one sitting. No food, no water, and no one bothering you-- it is that interesting. Dr. Doidge, the author, teaches us that our brains  are constantly changing and evolving, a concept he calls plasticity. In his book, he describes many stories of his interviews and cases where people's lives are changed very dramatically, especially when they learn that their brains are not hard wired, but instead fluid and dynamic in action. Even in our later years, use of this new-found Delta Fos B and its family of chemicals can throw a genetic switch in our brains to improve skills and abilities.  In school many of us were taught some simple lock and receptor theories that just never seemed to cover a subject as complicated as addiction. We were taught that a shower of dopamine or defective  D2 receptors covered subjects like Parkinson's Disease, yet no one ever dreamed that the brain itself can make it's own fundamental changes as it deals with these difficulties. Doidge reminds us many times that the human brain is fully capable of doing just that. Like the most modern of computers updated constantly, the brain bests them all in its efforts. This text is quite unique as most science books are concerned:  there are no photos, no PET scans, and no brain wave analyses you can observe. Usually books,  such as a molecular biology book, is crammed with data tables (DTs) for example. Also, the index is completely blank of the words GABA, epi, norepi, and glutamate, so I am guessing the author (and good doctor) is taking for granted you already know their functions.  There is one unfortunate credit the author gives though.  He is one of these modern neuroscientists who is committed to Sigmund Freud, telling us that it was Freud who basically understood neuroplasticity all along,  but just could never explain it.  I find that difficult to believe, since Freud described only 3 simple states to the human psyche, and  the fact that Freud himself smoked excessively,  never being able to defeat his own addiction.

B000W082S0|5.0|For 3 years now, I've been a David A. Carter fan. Why 3 years? You put two and two together. He's the author of these three *very* cool pop-up books that are unlike any pop-up books I've ever seen. They are like individual works of art only they're purchasable at any generic bookstore. It's \\"Pop\\" art. Get the double entendre? Well, if not, take a look at the pics above.    My first introduction to his work was with the book: \\"One Red Dot.\\" Since then he's created \\"600 Black Spots\\" and \\"Blue 2.\\" I purchased these in \\"new\\" condition for half of their purchase price on Amazon. However, if you're the type of parent who lets their child run amok with their baby books (not a bad thing) this may have to take a backseat for a year or two. I had to be very careful with my daughter when reading this book. Like any one-year-old her first instinct was to grab then ensuingly tear off the colorful fluttering paper. But I did manage to keep the book \\"relatively\\" unscathed and usable for my second daughter.    He's written a couple more \\"traditional\\" pop up books about bugs but these were the ones that hooked me. Oh and one more thing, one of the pages makes a great sawing noise when the blades scrape against the paper as you open the page. Clever.  'Kathleen Dougherty  [...]
B000H0MKGK|4.0|So why am I reviewing a CD that already has 433 reviews? Because I am of an older generation (in my late 40's) and find many songs on this CD to be reassuring that there is hope for my kids generation beyond the mass produced sex pop stars.    John Mayer writes intelligent songs and puts them to real music (Not just the average Brittany Spears/ Paris Hilton sex appeal - which definitely has its place). He plays a bluesy guitar and sings with feeling and emotion. \\"Waiting on the world to change\\" is a great song. There are some good love songs as well and Mayer has a good voice which suits the music. My kids listen to this and I approve because it is more sophisticated than a lot of the other pop music that they bring home. I try to be open and encourage my kids to learn about music and it's messaging. A lot of it is crap and there will always be more of it out there. But this is different and I hope John Mayer keeps putting this kind of quality out.
1591841992|5.0|If you have ever scribbled on the back of a napkin or for that matter any piece of paper while explaining something to a cohort, this book might help you.  Mr.  Roam's main premise is that pictures on the back of a napkin are a most effective way to solve problems and sell ideas.  He takes you through his process in this quick read and convincing book.  His suggestion to solve business problems with simple drawings could raise a few doubts.  Drawings are not business solutions is the common wisdom.   Conventional tools such as spreadsheets, deep mathematical analysis are the norm.   The book more than adequately addresses the doubts and other questions about drawing pictures to accomplish business objectives.  He resolves denials like \\"I can't draw or I don't carry napkins in my pocket \\".  This is accomplished by demonstrating how we all have the ability to draw within the system he has developed.  He first drew a successful proposal on the back of a napkin while eating breakfast on a train in England. In the book we are taught by leading us through the development of the complete solving/selling process.  The book is written in an easy to read conversational style and is laced with the type of drawings he proposes that are most useful in attacking the most intractable of problems.  While reading the book one finds themselves thinking things like \\"I can do that\\" or \\"I need to remember the steps in the process so I can do them whenever I have a problem and a napkin\\"  We are introduced to a group of problems that have been solved using the system. In those solutions the drawings were not only on napkins but white boards or just sheets of paper.  The reader begins to understand that the system is a cleverly developed method to cause one to think not only outside the box but with pictures rather than words.  He also takes care in pointing out that timing and following a sequence of steps is most important.  Pictures are often said to be worth a thousand words.  He givesexamples that explain when one is selling the idea one has to be sure the audience is led to the conclusions that the team found while developing the solution.  Just flashing a picture and saying \\"this is the solution\\" is not usually the most effective way to convince those you are trying to convince.  The book takes us from puzzle (the problem) to plan (the selling of the solution) in simple and easy to follow steps.  In these days we are constantly faced with solving complex problems. The Back of the Napkin presents a thought process and method that can help solve those problems. Using the method will help sell the solution. It becomes an arsenal one wants in his tool kit. When you couple that arsenal with an enjoyable read there is little to lose and much to gain. Now where are those napkins?

Well in English when we came back for a new semester about a two months into the class our teacher was gonna make us read Ender's Game.I hated the idea of having to read, I didn't want to. We listened to it over tape. And each day i'd love this book more and more. This is probably the only book i've read in years. It's amazing, after class was over at home i'd read there to. My parents must of thought something was going wrong but man. This book is incredible. I recommend it 1000/10
0307387178|5.0|After reading the first 25 pages I was angry at this stubborn, and in my opionion mentally ill young man.  He refused sound advice, again and again and again.  But I kept reading and was glad for it.  Whether he was mentally ill is not for me to say.  Stubborn, yes he was that.  But he was also adventurous and courageous beyond anything I would have attempted.  And he seemed to do reasonably well until the last few weeks of his life.  I wonder how many mistakes I would have made or how long I would have lasted in the Alaskan wilderness.  Probably a few more mistakes and definitely not as long as Chris did.  This wonderful book will take you into his mind.  Be prepared to be angry.  And in the end it will take you into his heart.  Be prepared to cry.  This was no ordinary person.  He will touch your spirit one way or another.

0975991477|5.0|Having seen Dr Lipton in action a few times, I still cannot forget how he revolutionized my life in that first lecture when I was so transformed I could hardly get out of my seat. He literally turned my medical school teaching around on its head, but the stupid thing is, I could have seen that if my eyes were open. Dr Lipton is the visionary who did. This book charts his personal and professional journey in this revolution in cellular biology. What I was not prepared for was just what a good honest read this is - Lipton is raw and open in his narrative as well as being accessible in his scientific explanations.   This takes its place up there with The Double Helix as one of the most significant scientific books of all time.
0440238609|5.0|Excellent trilogy; even the middle book, traditionally the weakest link of any three-book chain, is solid. Finely drawn characters, fascinating \\"what if\\" parallel worlds, and a lot of depth and research implied (but not paraded in front of the reader in a \\"look at all the homework I did\\" manner, as is the case with some authors). This is a Young Adult series in the finest tradition, addressing adolescent coming-of-age issues in such a way that an adult would find interesting. And Pullman never writes down to his audience, either. As to the highly hyped \\"controversy,\\" the aspects regarding the role of organized religion are handled intelligently and are not always what they seem by the conclusion. It's a novel -- fiction -- and the best fiction both entertains and makes you think. His Dark Materials succeeds on both levels.
B000JVT1U0|5.0|This film is deservedly a cult classic.  Not only is it a good mystery, it also offers a fascinating view of Celtic/pagan beliefs. All of the actors are excellent in their roles.          There is very little difference between the two DVDs, just a few extra minutes. However, it is good to have a back-up in case something happens to one DVD.
B000I2IT44|5.0|The reviewer 'bruceski\\" sums this DVD up very nicely, so I won't waste much space here.<br />Steven Wilson is, of course, Amazing here.<br />Nothing against Chris Maitland, because he is an excellent drummer, but the switch to Gavin Harrison (shown and heard on this DVD) is powerful! The guy doesn't miss.<br />This is an incredibly tight band.<br /><br />Be sure you are 'properly medicated' while enjoying the interesting additions on disc 2, particularly 'Cymbal Song'.<br /><br />Note: bruceski might be pleased to know that point 3 of his 'minor complaint' list has apparently been rectified. My copy came in an exceptionally sturdy plastic housing.
B000002H92|5.0|The Doors' In Concert shows the band in top form whether they're a loose jamming blues band or if they're performing theater. The first disc mostly contains music that was originally released as Absolutely Live in 1970. While Jim Morrison obviously sounds inebriated on the bluesy numbers (\\"Who Do You Love\\", \\"Build Me a Woman\\", \\"Alabama Song\\", etc), his ragged performance actually adds to the proceedings. The version of \\"When The Music's Over'' is very good as Robby Krieger's guitar cuts like a buzzsaw through Ray Manzarek's  organ lines while John Densmore's sudden stops and starts add a lot of drama. \\"Celebration of the Lizard\\" is pure theater as the band's performance bounces from a whisper to a scream throughout under Morrison's poetic tour de force.  A rousing version of \\"Soul Kitchen\\" closes Disc 1.<br /><br />Much of the music on Disc 2 was released as 1983's Alive, She Cried and 1987's Live at the Hollywood Bowl. Here the band plays it a little more straight. While Jim does some nonsensical rambling on \\"Roadhouse Blues\\", this song along with \\"Love Me Two Times\\" and \\"You Make Me Real\\" don't vary much from the originals. \\"Texas Radio and the Big Beat\\" provides an intro to \\"Love Me Two Times\\" while Jim rattles off poetry during \\"Light My Fire\\" and \\"Moonlight Drive.\\" Also included are a wicked version of \\"Unknown Soldier\\" and a studio remake of Them's \\"Gloria\\" that is better than the original. The closing version of \\"The End\\" is killer, adding even more drama to the original. All told, In Concert is a great live compilation from the Doors, a band that sounded like no other.

1582701709|1.0|One star for a clever marketing idea. IMO \\"The Secret\\" is a pure marketing tool.  The Law of Attraction has been around forever - it is no secret.  But, people will buy into a secret won't they?    Very clever... but only new to people who have never heard of this law before.     What will you market next The Law of Karma?  Wonder what you will call it? How else can you explain babies getting terrible diseases ... did a one year old draw cancer to him or herself? How about 911 or Hiroshima or a million other horrors?  Thousands of people drew all that horror to themselves.  There is something working in the universe, but to simply call it \\"The Secret\\" just takes advantage of peoples hope.

It's a little weird though because of it's topic which is basically women haven't had babbies in a hell of a long time and most families will just be gone as they can't reproduce to carry their name on.<br /><br />It gets a little twisted in a few areas with the people and their own agendas and all. All together it was a pretty damn good movie and I'd buy it again.<br /><br />HD DVD qualities:<br />HD Video: ***** 5stars for quality, I don't remember hardly any fuzzing in any of the video at all. the explosions were really good.<br />Audio: great audio, though it does seem to get really loud in the explosions and all and then the talking parts you kind of have to turn it up. I find that a little annoying but the clearity of the audio was really good.

0618918248|5.0|I do not have anything too remarkable to say, but I will offer these details:<br /><br />-I was not sure what I thought about God when I picked up this book<br />-I was pretty sure I couldn't be happy without religion<br />-I picked up this book<br />-I changed my mind in all camps<br />-My only complaint is that his analysis abandons the idea of an absent God. He doesn't rule out the possibility of a God who creates, then sits back and watches the creation, never interfering. He says, in this case, why bother to call upon a God, if S/He has so little bearing in your life? But that's not very rational. Just because something isn't useful, doesn't make it untrue. So, I am left with mostly great compliments for Dawkins, and only one complaint, within 420 pages of masterpiece.<br /><br />Read it.
B0012Q94QW|3.0|10,000 BC is one of those films that is not meant to be taken seriously by dedicated students of history or paleontology.  It is to these two disciplines that Raquel Welch was to ONE MILLION BC.  Director Roland Emmerich eschewed accuracy for entertainment and the result is an action-packed film that delivers the dramatic goods.  Some critics have further complained of what they saw as gratuitous violence, but for a film that deals with a brutal age, the violence is far more  subdued than gorishly up front.<br /><br />The plot is simple enough.  Some bad guy cavemen on horseback attack a peaceful tribe and carry off some tribespeople, one of whom is the mate of the hero.  The bulk of the action consists of his attempts to free them.  What makes this film a crowd pleaser is the convincing special effects that dominate.  There are several scenes of marauding wooley mammoths that have to be seen to be believed.  As long as Emmerich keeps audience focus of the logistics of mammoth killing, he is on firm historical ground. The background scenery is glacial western Europe, and one can sense that this was pretty much the way it was.  The tribes people speak impeccable English and we can see that they have a rich tapestry of religion and culture.  After the kidnapping of the hero's mate, Emmerich distorts geological fact in a way that surprisingly enough does not intrude on viewer interest.  Within the latter part of the film, he has the hero trek across a bewildering variety of landscape that ranges from glacial cold to tropical jungle to desert sands.  But because we are so involved in the hero's quest we wink at even scenes of pre-dynastic Egyptian pyramid building and hints of a connection between the deluge of lost Atlantis and the earliest of the Pharoahs.  What emerges by the end is the realization that viewer interest is once again maintained by characters with whom we can identify.  All the other eye candy of computer graphics takes a back seat.  In 10,000 BC, Roland Emmerich found this hard to achieve balance.erich found this hard to achieve balance.
0307388840|5.0|I have never before read one of Ian McEwan's novels so I did not know what to expect when reading this book. It is an astounding, lush, vivid, gripping book. The language is poetic and entoxicatingly beautiful and possesses so much insight and power. McEwan characters are deep, riveting, and completely believable. This novel is heart-breaking, tender, majestic, and flawless. It is truly a book to sweep the reader off their feet and get lost in. This book will always stand as a testament to the incredulous ability literature has to enrapture the reader and pull at their heart-strings. Highly recommended.
B0013FDM7E|5.0|I first read Richard Matheson's tale I AM LEGEND, back in college.  Originally written in 1954, the story fit perfectly with this period of literary horror in the post-WWII world.      Depicting the struggle of one man to survive, and keep his sanity, in a world overrun with vampires, Robert Neville hunts these creatures by day, and returns to his \\"coffin\\" by night for protection from the undead - a uniquely perverse twist on the vampire myth.    Having seen both the excellent Vincent Price and Charlton Heston versions of the story, I must say that the performance by Will Smith in this movie was the best of the three, capturing the inner torment of Neville in his impossible struggle.    For fans of the story I AM LEGEND, which was the inspiration to authors like STEVEN KING, and set the trend for the next 50+ years of vampire and zombie novels, comic books and movies, I also highly recommend the following products - you will not be disappointed:    [[ASIN:1933239212 Richard Matheson's I Am Legend (Graphic Novel)]]  [[ASIN:1419667483 Zombie Factory: 27 Tales of Bizarre Comix Madness from Beyond the Tomb]]  [[ASIN:B0002ABURA Dawn of the Dead (Widescreen Unrated Director's Cut)]]
B000ZLFALI|5.0|My wife and I rented for a few nights and ended up watching it 3 times before we returned it.  My wife hardly ever watches movies more than once, and to watch a movie twice in such a short time is unheard of.  My 17 year-old son even watched it twice and demanded we buy it, so we did.<br /><br />The movie flows nicely from song to song and never seems out of place.  The songs were changed slightly to fit the scenes, like a slight county beat for \\"I've just seen a face\\".  The actors are great.  You can really believe them and their voices are perfect for the characters.<br /><br />If DVDs wear-out, this will be the first one in my collection as we love to just put it on and listen to the music and look for new things we missed the first time.

0452289963|5.0|I tend to like books that reach into the philosphical realms, and this book fits my taste. The message has been written in book form before. (\\"Be Here Now\\") among others, but only A New Earth explains techniques that are useful in every day life, to achieve the stillness, recommended by the author. The author explains how to use these tcechniques. While reading this book, I began highlighting and flagging pages, then, the last chapter, I did not highlight or flag, cause of the importance of it. The one habit I'm enjoying applying to my life, is to observe things of nature without naming them. The feeling you get while doing this is very satisfying. While reading A New Earth, and applying it, I was able to purge my countless thoughts, that are often negative and repatitive,and meaningless.  I find myself left with an open space where my thoughts at one time existed. This is, ofcourse, mostly the presence. My mood is better, and my hobbies (stitching) have taken on a new life. I see people differently than I did before I read this book.<br />  I feel that very religous people are not giving this book a chance, but Eckhart quotes the lines of Jesus continuously throughout it's pages. So, if you have any doubts, read the book, before criticizing it. I needed this book in my life right now. You might, too.
B000F0UV0E|5.0|I agree 100% with several other reviewers about the official Amazon.com review - ignore it!! This is a lovely album, full of beautiful songs, with a very engaging mixture of 'story' or relationship subjects counterpointed with Knopfler's very recognizable guitar playing. Certain of the songs are achingly beautiful - for example, I find the first (Beachcombing) that way, not that its a slow song, it bounces along quietly with Knopfler's guitar gently adding a twist to the line. Others, like 'Rollin' On', are straight melancholy - a great song for Harris's voice. They are all good of course.    The songs are all intelligent, covering a wide range of subjects, personas, speeds and moods - several remind me on John Prine (e.g. 'Hello in There') - songs that seem very authentic, speaking of what seems like lifelike experiences.     Its a great match - I have always loved Knopfler's work, both in Dire Straits and afterwards, and for decades have followed Emmylou Harris's career from her early CD's to the latest. While I have never really liked country music in general, Emmylou's style, songs and approach has engaged me from the very first listen. Her high, slightly edgy voice, with Knopfler's low, gruffer one, works really well.    A great listen...a CD with a CD's worth of good tunes and words.

B000MXPE7O|2.0|Plenty of people have reviewed this film and have pretty much given the whole storyline.  I'm going to spare you the details of the story and get down to why I can't recommend this movie.      Like many people, I was excited about a spy movie that featured great actors, and had Robert De Niro directing.  The problem with the movie is that it is a complete bore.  The main mystery/plot of the film is similar to the one in the Kevin Costner movie \\"No Way Out\\".  Unlike \\"No Way Out\\", this one doesn't keep you on the edge of your seat.  Like \\"The Godfather\\", we bounce back and forth from past to present.  The problem is that we are intruduced to too many story lines and too many characters.  It was difficult to tell what the goal of the story was.  Matt Damon's character might as well have been played by a robot.  He shows absolutely no emotion.  It's hard to root for characters like this.  The movie has a few decent moments.  But at almost three hours long, the movie feels over done.  A good 45 minutes of this movie could have easily been cut out.      I think there might have been a decent story somewhere in there, but either the writing or directing or both stepped in its way.  We are constantly being sidetracked by subplots and characters with little meaning.  Add in a ridiculous revelation at the end that you could see coming the moment his son announced he wanted to work in the CIA, and this movie just doesn't hold up.  The effort was there, but sometimes a movie's parts are better than the whole.
0743298039|4.0|This review is based on the 14 disc, unabridged, audio book version of this novel.  I find myself in a very odd position.  I thoroughly enjoyed the experience of this book.  Not for the story, which if I were rating separately would get only three stars.  But what makes this a great read is the writing.  This is an example of the best prose being published today. The two readers (Bianca Amato and Jill Tanner) of the audio book added significantly to the enjoyment. The two readers played the role of the two narrators in the story (Margaret Lee, a biographer, and novelist Vida Winter). Their reading of this well written novel kept me engaged far more than the story.  This would have gotten five stars if I evaluating the writing and reading alone. The dual aspect of the narration worked well in the execution of the story telling.    I am recommending this book for those who enjoy the experience of the reading.  While it is not a great story, it is a good one.  Its main failings are that it dwells occasionally on insignificant events and the ending may disappoint some readers.  These shortfalls are easily overshadowed by the strengths. You may be slightly disappointed at the end, but the trip will make up for it. I am also recommending the audio version.  If you are into audio books, you may find this one of the best, as I did. It adds to the experience.    I am looking forward to Diane Setterfield's next novel.

0307346617|5.0|It's around fifteen years from now. The zombie horde menace, while not completely eliminated, has been convincingly fought to a standstill and pushed back. Human beings are again in charge of most of the planet, but at great cost. The better part of society as we know it has collapsed. In many ways the world has turned back the clock to a more agrarian society. Manual labor is the norm again, rather than the exception. The population is considerably lessened. How did all this happen? How did it get to that stage? That's the focus of this wonderful book by Max Brooks. Brooks imagines a world recently overrun by zombie hordes. He tells the tale through the eyes of a journalist/biographer who is collecting stories of survivors and their experiences, much in the way current WWII and Korea veterans are being interviewed to this day. Some of them were important people, historically speaking. Some were not. But all of them saw the war through different prisms. They all had something to contribute to the story of the zombies, aka Zed.<br /><br />Let me say something else. Max Brooks has a lot of time on his hands. He has given so much thought to the methods, tactics, strengths, weaknesses, and rationale (or lack thereof) of the zombie hordes it is stunning. On a personal level, I've spent the last sixteen years training in how to control people, up to and including killing them. Max Brooks, in a short book, showed me how inadequate all my training would be against a zombie infestation. It truly was amazing. I've really got to modify my training.<br /><br />Apart from the technical acumen Mr. Brooks brought to the story there is also the sheer brilliance of the telling. This story would be amazing no matter what the subject matter. The fact that it was zombies is largely irrelevant to the story, in many ways. Substitute any disaster, but particularly any viral or similar epidemic, and you have a similar tale of human suffering and endurance. Mr. Brooks is simply that good a writer.<br /><br />Add to that the added difficulty that Mr. Brooks was telling a tale through the eyes of dozens of people. Yet each one of them sounded like their own unique person. Too many authors write different characters that all somehow manage to sound exactly the same. They are merely variations on a theme. The book comes from the imagination of one person so it's no wonder they all sound like the same product. Mr. Brooks doesn't fall into that trap. All of his characters have a unique voice. They all have something to say.<br /><br />This was an amazing book that I've recommended to a number of people, including many that don't really like zombies per se but love good reads. This book is a great read that just happens to be about zombies. Do yourself a favor and check it out. Who knows? It may give you a leg up just in case one day the zombies do rise. It surely couldn't hurt.to that the added difficulty that Mr. Brooks was telling a tale through the eyes of dozens of people. Yet each one of them sounded like their own unique person.

B0010YSD7M|5.0|I never watched the series before Ben Browder came in season 9.  I decided to watch the other seasons to catch up and in doing so, by the time I got to see Ben Browder as Cameron Mitchell I missed O'Neil so much it was hard to get into the series.  I don't know why I couldn't connect with Ben Browder's character since I'm a huge fan of his work.  But, somehow in the Ark of Truth he pulled off bringing Mitchell into my heart as much as O'Neil.  This is a great movie, I'll watch it many times, as well as rewatching the series.  It was like a class reunion, only with everyone you ever loved.  This movie kept me in suspense and suprised me more that I thought it would.  Well done!

006113399X|4.0|The Redbreast -- as a story -- is really quite good, especially if you are a World War II buff as I am. But make no mistake, this is not a WWII war-espionage thriller, such as written by Joseph Kanon. Far from it. It is a simple police detective story. There are moments of excellent tension and suspense, however. And as is the custom these days, the reader must constantly switch back and forth from 1944 to 2000 for about the first 200 pages, but here the saving grace is the author's correct decision to make all chapters very short. It takes about 100+ pages to figure out what's going on -- about par for today's novels. It's merely a literary technique, and there is no particular need to be critical of this style.<br /><br />Alas, with the exception of 2 or 3 characters, all remaining characters are somewhat paper cut-outs, predictable and one-dimensional -- either all evil or all good, or 100% superficial. Thus, the reader gets none of the great characters in all of Alan Furst's books; none of the subtleties of Gordianus (a detective) in Steven Saylor's Sub Roma Series; way below any character ever developed by Arturo Perez-Reverte; and even little of the superficial but believable characters in Cara Black's sleuth stories set in Paris and featuring Aimee Leduc. It's not that the story is so short as to prevent character development. The book spans over 500 pages.<br /><br />But, even if the characters are so-so, the story is really very good, contemporary and believable in the main.  Some of the dialogue is also quite good. Thus, I gave it a 4 rather than the 3 it would otherwise receive for its poor character development.<br /><br />Don Bartlett, the translator, is British. [...] Thus, the English language translation is unremittingly British, often rather humorous when read by an American. (The word \\"curb\\" is spelled \\"kerb,\\" for instance. The book is replete with British colloquialisms.) While not a deterrent to enjoying the story, the British English is off-putting at times. Worse, however, Bartlett's translation may have down-graded what likely was a more erudite and intellectual manuscript in its native Norwegian. Bartlett's language usage has no nuance.<br /><br />All-in-all, I recommend the book. The story moves along nicely, once you understand most of the features of the tale.  I think this author has potential. I would encourage him to get an American English translator to upgrade translations sold in the USA from ordinary spoken British English to what his stories may actually deserve -- something above a 14-year old's vocabulary.ever, Bartlett's translation may have down-graded what likely was a more erudite and intellectual manuscript in its native Norwegian.

B000ZN802W|2.0|This movie is nearly unwatchable... not because the acting is unbelievably flat (which it is), not because the narration of the main character's sister is preachy and overdone (which it is, sounding like a high school senior trying to use all her SAT vocabulary in one sitting).      The movie is bad because the story is so thoroughly outclassed by the many others that went before it in this genre, both fictional and non-fictional.  Throughout this load of crap, I asked myself why I would bother to sit side-car on the road to self-discovery of a self-centered, preachy 22-year-old.      The list of films and books that do this voyage-of-self-discovery business better is endless, and occasionally referenced or imitated in this film.  \\"A Man Called Wolf,\\" or \\"Travels with Charley,\\" or \\"Cast Away\\" (either the book by Stevenson or the film with Tom Hanks), or \\"Victory\\" (by Joseph Conrad) or Jack London's wonderful short story \\"To Build a Fire\\", or of course Thoreau's \\"Walden.\\"  Hell, even the totally self-centered \\"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance\\" is a better journey.    Save your time and money.  Pass up this sub-par imitation of the really great works of isolation and discovery.  Go read Jack London.  Or, go watch \\"Survivorman,\\" and at least figure out why the protagonist should have died when he fell into the frozen stream in the first scene.

B0012QE4OO|2.0|David Rice (Hayden Christensen) is what is known in paranormal circles as a \\"jumper,\\" one of only a handful of specially-gifted individuals who have the ability to transport themselves from one corner of the globe to another at will (if nothing else, such a talent sure cuts down on a person`s transportation costs, no small thing in this age of $4.00/gallon gas).  Obviously working below his pay-grade here, Samuel L. Jackson plays Roland, the leader of a group of religious fanatics who, believing only God should have the power to be in more than one place at a time, roam the earth seeking out and destroying all the jumpers they can get their hands on.<br /><br />Essentially a travelogue masquerading as a thriller, \\"Jumper\\" takes a reasonably promising premise and turns it into inane wish-fulfillment drivel.  There are more holes in the plot than there are wormholes for the jumpers to pass through, and the final action sequences border on the incoherent.  The movie mistakes hectic activity for excitement and leaves most of its earnest performers stranded high and dry with little to do but play second fiddle to all the hyper-kinetic visuals and special effects going on around them (the gifted Diane Lane, in particular, is woefully wasted as the mother who abandoned David when he was five).  Ah well, at least they got a few all-expenses-paid trips to some of the world's most prestigious locales as compensation.<br /><br />Indeed, the one redeeming grace is that the movie takes us to a number of highly photogenic tourist spots around the globe, from the Empire State Building to the pyramids at Giza to, most memorably, the Coliseum in Rome.  That last sequence alone is almost worth the price of admission.
B00111YM5G|4.0|Synopsis: The Archangel Gabriel descends into the intermediate world of Purgatory on a mission to destroy a group of fallen angels who have taken control of the realm, thus preventing the human souls there from evolving upward. Six Archs (Archangels) have preceded Gabriel on this dangerous mission and all have mysteriously disappeared into the foreboding landscape. Will Gabriel be able to stand alone against the combined forces of Sammael, Amodeus, Lilith, Molloch, Ahriman and the rest? And what of the six missing Archs? What horrible fate has befallen them?<br /><br />Critique: The '07 film `Gabriel' has cleverly blended disparate elements from numerable popular, financially successful films and added several interesting ideas of its own into one storyline that may not be highly original but is definitely entertaining.<br /><br />Recipe for making `Gabriel':<br />- Begin with the basic ingredients (storyline) from the cult classic `The Prophecy' minus the comedic elements provided by Christopher Walken,<br />- Blend with the graphic, cinematic style of `Sin City',<br />- Sprinkle liberally with some of the pervasive melancholy made famous in `The Crow',<br />- Add a pinch of costuming ala `The Matrix', one creepy looking bald, vampirish bad guy reminiscent of `Blade II', an attractive brunette who bears a strong resemblance to Kate Beckinsale as she appeared in `Underworld' and a little `City of Angels' at the very end.<br /><br />Secret Ingredient:<br />-For a deeper more profound flavoring check out an obscure, Indie film from '03 titled `The Despiser'. It also deals with a war in Purgatory in which the ultimate danger is that death in this realm equates to permanent extinction. Sound familiar?<br /><br />While there are plenty of similarities and comparisons one can make with other films `Gabriel' is still somehow unique enough to carry a distinct flavor and texture all its own that should attract a wide audience of loyal fans. I'm certainly one!
B00111YM5G|5.0|I wasn't expecting more than an OK B movie at best when I rented it, but I was shocked (!) at how good it actually was. Good acting by unknown (to me) actors, interesting plot, very dark and intense atmosphere, excellent make up and post-apocalyptic set.     Even more shocking is how the independent filmmaker managed this tour de force with a ridiculously low budget (he mentioned under $200,000 in the featurette)

B00133KFGW|5.0|First of all I have read a couple of other reviews and I don't think you need to write a synopsis of the whole plot line in a review.  This might take away from discovering the magic of a film to someone who hasn't seen it yet.  So that being said I will keep my review simple and to the point.  I found this movie to be amazing and awe-inspiring!!  I am a music teacher and I have always felt that music is my best friend.  Someplace to escape to when the world around me was not so great.  I do think that music connects us as human beings.  It is a God given gift and like August I can find music and all kinds of noise from the chirping of birds to the hustle and bustle of a busy city street.  If you believe in the power of music to bring people together than you must see this movie.  It will lift you up and help you to have faith in a world where life is often times difficult.

0143038419|3.0|So, I think the message rings true to you more if you're a, sorry to say it, female. This book, more like a story, is thoughtful, funny, and insightful. It may not be for everyone but I say give it a chance. The author is so honest and you want to reach out and hug her sometimes. There are moments where I am inspired and some where I laugh out loud. I think many woman can relate to her story - and many men too. It's really a story about a person who lived her life the way she thought she should until one day, she could no longer keep it all inside. Her emotions get the best of her, crying every night on the bathroom floor and finally she decides to be brave and make a change. It's painful and easy to relate to. It will inspire others to have courage and you'll laugh along the way too.
B00005N5RM|4.0|This is a perfect example of a horror movie that can only be scary to a child or someone who's not a regular horror movie watcher.      Think about it- a giant blob goes around and kills people.  Isn't that funny?  And isn't it even funnier to someone who's extremely familiar and huge fans of other horror classics such as the Exorcist, or any Stephen King movie?  There's no WAY someone who's a big fan of those movies would be able to find any horror in a blob going around attacking people.    I remember as a kid I used to pretend my action figures were the victim of the blob on my bedroom floor- the blob being playdoh or silly puddy or something.  Ah, I can still remember the smell of playdoh and silly puddy.  You never forget it.      Anyway, it's not a scary movie to an adult, to put it simply, but it's entertaining enough to watch a couple times.
0553582038|3.0|It's hard to write a review of this portion of the story without reading the rest of the story that Martin leaves for the Dance of Dragons.  I felt like I was waiting 900 pages for something bad to happen to Cersei Lannister.  I thought leaving Tyrion out was an interesting way to build suspense, but it would have been nice to have a few more clues, a little more buzz about where he could have gone.    Sweetrobin is an awfully annoying character.  In general, the Eyrie is a boring place to be in the novel.  I wish Martin had revealed his plans for Alayne a little sooner, so there was a more concrete reason for being with those characters.    Actually, more action all around would have been nice.  I kept waiting for the big battle.  Samwell could have gotten to Oldtown way sooner and then there would have been more time for things to happen there.  More time spent with the Reavers would have fulfilled my bloodlust perhaps.    Martin does live up to his reputation for being completely ruthless to the most honorable characters, but it didn't shock me like the first book did when he killed Ned Stark or threw Bran off a window ledge.  Maybe he just can't shock anymore.    Except for Arya none of my favorite characters were really the subject of this novel.  That's not Martin's fault, but I didn't feel like he really gave me a reason to care about this book.

B0011NVC9I|1.0|I had quite high hopes for this film.  After all, it boasts some of the greatest star power of the last 10 years and is the brain-child of a great writer/producer with films like the Back to the Future series, Contact, and Cast Away to his credit.  With this kind of build-up, why did I feel like I was watching yet another spinoff of Shrek?  I'm all for animation when it suits a purpose, but after half of the film I had had enough.  It did not matter how well it adhered to the original story, it was becoming a great story badly told.<br /><br />Despite Malkovich's reputation--which I have never quite understood--I must admit that yet again he did a great job of playing himself.  The only role in which he really pulled off the \\"act\\" was in playing himself in Being John Malkovich.  Credit does go to the animators for capturing him as well as they did.<br /><br />After watching what I could stand I had to watch King Arthur again just to remind myself what a truly GREAT character actor Ray Winstone really is.  And tomorrow I plan to watch The 13th Warrior again to wash my mind out and refocus on a really well done telling of the Beowulf legend.<br /><br />I am rating this film ONE star only because the system will not allow me to give it NO stars.
B000001FN3|4.0|Tales of Mystery and Imagination is probably the second best album the Alan Parsons Project ever created... even though it's honestly a ripoff of Pink Floyd (or more accurately, a watered down secondrate approach to the music of Pink Floyd).    That's not necessarily a criticism though, because what Alan Parsons DOES have is the ability to write highly memorable and melodic pop songs with a distinct advantage of making the music come across as warm and friendly (and arguably the ability to make his music sound more commercial than Floyd ever could- though this is debatable).    I don't really believe the entire raven concept is as flawless as many believe it is, however.  There's just a noticeable feeling of slight cheesiness about the entire thing that screams secondrate and simply refuses to let go for the entire duration of the album.  Yes, the concept closely follows the work of Edgar Allan Poe but... eh.  It's still cheesy if you ask me.     Like most of Alan Parsons work, he takes the sound and style of Pink Floyd's legendary music and makes it lighter and fluffier, or rather, easier to digest for casual music fans.  Right from the get go (this album) music fans were probably aware that Alan Parsons would have a successful and comfortable career just basically writing or rewriting Floyd-inspired tracks.  In other words, the Alan Parsons Project had the rare potential to continue the style that had -and continued to make- Pink Floyd insanely famous (and they could pull it off *very* well, might I add).    Honestly the entire album doesn't feel like a collection of compositions but rather a collection of artsy pop songs.  Imagine Procol Harum or the Moody Blues but with more commercialized recording technology to give their music a distinct radio-friendly sound, and that basically sums up the way Tales of Mystery and Imagination sounds.    Now the *songwriting* is quite enjoyable.  The man couldn't write a bad song back in the 70's.  I Robot is perhaps my favorite Alan Parsons Project album, but Tales of Mystery and Imagination would be my second favorite.    The atmosphere that runs throughout the entire album is clearly influenced by classical pieces (similar to what the Electric Light Orchestra was doing at the time) but with the complexity and challenging aspect of said classical compositions completely removed (so these tracks serve better as a collection of diverse pop songs with only slight classical tendencies).      This makes the album overall an easier listen for the unsophisticated, or rather, for those who simply don't like being challenged by music.    Now let's talk about what you can expect, as a music listener.      Basically the first side of the album consists of some really melodic and occasionally whacked out pop songs (the ones where Arthur Brown participates with the vocal melodies are REALLY awesome and certainly worth hearing- easily the highlight of the entire album) and side two is occupied with a lengthy artificial classical suite leading to a repetitive 6-minute instrumental jam soon after that honestly feels like it was stolen from the second half of Black Sabbath's \\"Wheels of Confusion\\" (titled \\"The Straightener\\").  The album ends with a meaningful ballad though.  Not anything Pink Floyd could have done better of course.    Overall, a good album but don't expect the level of brilliance to reach that of Pink Floyd, the Moody Blues, Electric Light Orchestra or Procol Harum.
B0010358CG|3.0|I am a devoted fan of REAL animation.  CG just doesn't do it for me.... but I must say of all the CG animation features I have watched, I found this one the most enjoyable.  Obviously a lot of work went into this production, even if it wasn't created through sweat and blood over the drawing table.  It's like watching a very long cut scene from a video game.

High school kids won't be influenced to pick a guitar up in 2020 becuse they heard this record for the first time. It is a solid pop album with some really catchy tunes. Yes the are hyped and they do deserve every bit of it. All the reviewers that call this cd and band rubbish check yourselves. With all the garbage American Idol nonsense being shoved in our faces these days it's great to find a band that may take some influence from the Talking Heads, Paul Simon, Peter Gabriel or African Music. I'll throw another band I mildly think they sound like...  The English Beat. I say buy it, it's $10 or less (A-Punk is worth that alone), play it, give it to your friend if you hate it.  Go look at the blogotheque take away shows on youtube. Great stuff. Show's that these guys are great live.
B000002KBA|4.0|The MONSTER guitar riff that opens up the album on \\"Speed King\\" reveals a band that was creating something new and radically different back in the early 70's, becoming the first ever SERIOUS heavy metal band.    The album is loaded with solid guitar riffs and EXTREMELY heavy rock music, though unfortunately it's not all roses and cupcakes.  The vocals on \\"Flight of the Rat\\" are pretty average, and the guitar playing on that song isn't anything to brag about either.      The rest of the album is pretty brilliant by hard rock standards though.  Whether it's the shorter energetic style of a song like \\"Bloodsucker\\" or the epic masterpiece of \\"Child in Time\\" or the guitar complexity of \\"Hard Lovin' Man\\" (that totally sounds like classic 70's metal) it's all here.      By the way, there's absolutely NOTHING out there like \\"Child in Time\\".  The slow build-up, the window-rattling guitar solo, the extra-powerful vocals of Ian Gillan, and just the highly unusual atmosphere of the song... it's unique in every single way.    Made in Japan is the best Deep Purple album, and the Come Taste the Band album is severely underrated as well, but you NEED to own In Rock.

B000E6ESL2|5.0|Starring Naomi Watts, Ryan Gosling, and Ewan McGregor, Stay has a mind-bending premise that will keep you guessing until the end of the film.<br /><br />Here's the skinny: Covering for a sick colleague, New York psychiatrist Sam Foster (McGregor) begins counseling disturbed art student Henry Letham (Gosling). Seemingly inspired by his idol, a painter infamous for committing suicide on his 21st birthday, Henry tells Sam he will shoot himself Saturday at midnight - the moment he turns 21. Sam, having previously saved his suicidal girlfriend Lila (Watts), takes the threat seriously but fails to detain Henry so he can be taken into medical custody (a rather grim prospect). Instead, while trying to track his patient down, Sam learns more about Henry and is gradually drawn into his world - Henry's parents are dead (Henry insists it's all his fault.), his girlfriend is \\"gone,\\" he seems to know what's going to happen before it does, he's sure he's going to hell, he tells Sam it's \\"too late\\" to save him, etc. The more Sam learns about Henry, the more he begins to lose his own grip on reality. (But for those of you who hate ambiguity, don't fret. All is revealed in the final scenes of the film.)<br /><br />First of all, the film is beautifully shot. Henry is an art student, and the film itself has a very artistic vibe. Scenes bleed into one another in a beautiful but disorienting manner. Shots are jumped in interesting ways. The closing credits are even artistic. The film's tone is mostly a collection of blues and grays, lots of dark shots, some cool silhouettes.<br /><br />Secondly, the film does a good job of keeping the audience off-track. You're never quite sure what is happening. Is Henry mad? Is Sam going mad? Are Henry and Sam one in the same? What is reality and what is psychosis? Even at the close, when the film's endgame is revealed, your brain has to chew on it for a while to put all of the pieces together.<br /><br />OK, SPOILER ALERT. Don't read further if you don't want to know the ending.<br /><br />Here's what's really going on: Henry is never really Sam's patient at all. He's the victim of a car accident. He's been thrown from the vehicle (he was driving), and he's lying faceup on the Brooklyn Bridge. Sam is simply a bystander who witnessed the car accident (in which Henry's parents and girlfriend have died) and has stopped to help.<br /><br />The movie is really a study of the mind - what an injured brain is thinking as death nears. Henry is conscious of Sam and the onlookers (all who appear in previous incarnations in the film, in Henry's \\"world\\"), and his racing mind is trying to reconcile things and make sense of them. Should he fight to try and live (with his family and girlfriend dead?), or should he succumb to death? He knows Sam is trying to help him, but is it really too late? Is the beauty of the world worth trying to stick around for? Suffering from a head wound and shock, how can Henry know what is real and what is only in his mind in those final moments, as time bends and distorts?<br /><br />I thought this was a BRILLIANT film. Highly original content treated in a totally engrossing, entertaining, beautiful manner. Performances were wonderful, and I was totally hooked. I did not see the ending coming, which was sooooo refreshing. While there is some adult language, and the film certainly deals with adult subject matter, this one is a MUST-SEE.Here's what's really going on: Henry is never really Sam's patient at all.

0345494997|4.0|I read this book as a book club assignment, and generally liked the book.  It didn't click in my mind too much why I didn't love it more until I read someone else's comments and it occured to me that indeed the characterizations just didn't reach deeply enough.  We heard Frank described from Mamah's point of view, but not enough to get into his head.  And even after reading many of Mamah's agonies about leaving her children, making decisions to leave her family for Frank, etc. I didn't get into her mind enough to feel that I understood her well at all.<br /><br />As a mother I found it disturbing that she could leave such young children for such a long period, and without warning.  And then to lose one of her closest friends and still not go back home, I found it hard to understand how she could do that.  I realize that she wanted to find herself, etc.  But after a few months in Europe where clearly she wasn't yet sure of what to do, I think she should have gone home and figured it out WITH her family, not apart from them.  She certainly burned bridges with her sister and her children.<br /><br />I applaud her for finally figuring herself out to some extent, but I think the price she and her family paid was too dear.  (The ending notwithstanding).  I knew very little about Frank going into the story and had no idea the murders were coming.  When they did occur I was very sad for all of the characters involved, and I felt that the ending was appropriate to the story, and didn't \\"fade out too quietly\\" as some others have complained.  It ended the \\"Mamah\\" chapter of Frank's life and gave us some sense of his grief at her death.<br /><br />I was happy for them both that at least for a short time they seemed to hit their stride both personally and as a couple.  That made the story, and agony, of reading about their personal struggles in Europe worth going through.  I enjoyed the writing style and it flowed very well as a story and wove truth and fiction very smoothly.  Overall, I would recommend this book although I can't say it will rank as one of my all time favorites.mmend this book although I can't say it will rank as one of my all time favorites.

B000M341QE|3.0|The Departed, starring Jack Nicholson, Matt Damon, and Leonardo DiCaprio, is a good (but REALLY LONG) movie.    Nicholson plays Frank Costello, an Irish mob boss in Boston. Costello relies on Colin Sullivan (Damon), his plant in the Boston police department, to keep himself one step ahead of the law. But the police know there's a rat, so they plant their own undercover officers within Costello's organization. One of those officers is Bill Castigan (DiCaprio), who goes under deep cover and ends up being one of Costello's most trusted heavies. As quickly become obvious, however, there's no way this thing is ending well.    This is DiCaprio in what I consider to be one of his best roles to date. His Bill Castigan is a deft pretender, but he's extremely vulnerable and scared that he'll be on the receiving end of a bullet at any moment. Nicholson and Damon also give great performances, but this is DiCaprio's movie.    This film is a modern Greek tragedy. As the story unfolds, we recognize how it must end. However, it is the method that Scorsese and his cast uses to get us there that makes the film so watchable. As with many Scorsese films, it runs long, but the ending, when it comes, is swift and merciless.    Worth seeing.
B0001I562I|5.0|I just loved this movie and so I bought it for my son.  He watches it over and over.  Cute & funny.
0307275639|3.0|Written by Mitch Albom, Tuesdays with Morrie tells about the author's relationship with Morrie Schwartz, his favorite college professor. After maintaining a close relationship with Morrie throughout college, Mitch graduates and then fails to keep in touch. In fact, Mitch forgets all about his professor until he sees him on Nightline one night. Turns out, Morrie's got Lou Gherig's disease, and he's dying. BUT he's dying with grace and fullness. He's filling his last days with friends, family, good food, the things he loves. He's seizing this opportunity to say his goodbyes and leave people with good memories of him.    Stricken, Mitch contacts Morrie and arranges a visit. Mitch makes a list of all of his big fears/questions. Then, he uses Morrie's unique perspective on life and death to illuminate these issues.    Morrie's outlook is refreshing, true, and rare. He tells us all the things we really already know, but forget. He reminds us that all those trite sayings about family and love being everything really are true. He admonishes us to value people over all else.    A quick, uplifting read.
B00000IQW3|5.0|My son and I have watched this movie several times, and we enjoy it just as much as the first time.
0439882826|5.0|I purchased two of these for Grandsons.  A big hit with both!  Wonderful craftsmanship on the pop-ups, and lots of them hidden in every corner, plus the big center page ones.  Excellent adventure for Star Wars fans.
B00005JNEI|4.0|\\"Fahrenheit 9/11\\" is an outstanding documentary covering some of the general facts and questions about 9/11.  The movie even goes so far as to examine the thoughts and feelings of the soldiers during the advent of the \\"war on terror\\" and does a good job of getting footage of the Iraqi people after the initial devestation of their cities.<br /><br />Moore couples witty humor with poignient moments and keen insight into the motivations and tactics of the leaders who are the faces of the elite running this war.<br /><br />My only problem with the movie is that it is just the tip of the iceberg.  There is so much more confirmed information that was left out of the movie.  However, I know that the general public in the very least was exposed to the many questions presented in this movie and, perhaps, started the journey down the rabbit hole into exploring more obvious questions from 9/11.<br /><br />As a starter into 9/11 conspiracy research, this movie is a good foundation.
B000I0RR76|5.0|Flynn is the classic Robin Hood, a charming, cunning rogue who steals the show as easily as he stills rich men's gold. Modern audiences may be quite cynical regarding this version; however, I find it to be a great, \\"non-preachy\\" escape from today's technology-dependent, big-budget films.

B000063UR1|2.0|If SILENT RUNNING were literature instead of a film, it would be accused of being a short short story masquerading as a novel.  Its greatest claim to fame is having been made by 2001 special effects guru Douglas Trumbull.  And there is no question that this is visually the most interesting SF film between 2001 and STAR WARS.  Like 2001 it was a SF film that was not intended to go directly to a drive in double bill.  It was intended to be taken seriously.<br /><br />There is no question that this is a film with good intentions and it was certainly made with great attention.  And Huey, Dewey, and the posthumously named Louie are among the most beloved and fondly remembered movie robots (I suppose most people know that the robots were performed by multiple amputee humans).  But the brute fact is that there simply isn't much of a story.  And what little story there is, is pretty danged bleak.  It is surprising that there is so little in the way of interesting story -- well, heck, that there is so little story at all, interesting or otherwise.  This was a talented trio of writers.  Michael Cimono and Deric Washburn would later win an Oscar for DEER HUNTER, while Steve Bocho would reinvent television with HILL STREET BLUES and other projects.<br /><br />In the end, SILENT RUNNING ends up being a visually less interesting distillation of the duller parts of 2001.  I will add that Bruce Dern is very good in what is essentially the only role in the movie (though I was amazed to see that I literally couldn't recognize Ron Rifkin in his small role).  I suppose students of SF should see it because of its \\"classic\\" status, but to be honest, it is not a terribly interesting film.
B00007L4OM|5.0|I am a major Jean Reno fan. I think Wasabi is one of his best works, I rented it on VHS, then bought a used copy at Blockbuster on VHS and finally decided it was time to upgrade it to DVD. It is a thoughly entertaining movie, and on a par with \\"Just Visiting\\". It is one of the real show cases of Reno's comedic/action talent. For several years now \\"Wasabi\\" is one of the standard videos I show people at video get togethers at our home.
B00005ATQD|5.0|I enjoyed EYES WIDE SHUT immensely and rate it at 6 stars out of a possible 5! As is the case with most Kubrick films, every time I see it I find a new and interesting interpretation. This film made brilliant use of light, color, texture, as well as sound and haunting music. All of the major screen performances were also excellent and very interesting.<br /><br />I remember first watching this film on a whim with my wife one snowey evening on late night television. We knew nothing about this film except for it being a Kubrick production. It was a haunting experience, and we stayed up into the late hours of the evening watching the movie.  It was a very, very strange film.<br /><br />Although I still don't think I get it all, the film involved: relationships between men and woman and attempts to question what it is that both genders seek from each other beyond the obvious.  It partially provides answers about the similarites and differences between these two while telling the story under somewhat threatening circumstances to get our attention.<br /><br />I am not certain of exactly what this film was trying to say about marriage, but know I will not tire of trying to learn this with repeated screenings. This was Kubrick' s last film as he died just after the first public screenings. His family and friends noted that he appeared relieved after the release of the film as though the outcome might have weighed heavily on his mind.<br /><br />Kubrick asked Steven Spielberg to direct AI, a long term project of his, which he intentionally postponed after he realized great technological changes would soon enable this film to be assembled much more effectively. Kubrick apparently wished this new film to be directed by another trusted and very capable individual. In my mind the fact that Kubric could step back and request another individual perhaps better equipped to bring his idea to the screen, is ample evidence of Kubrick's greatness.
0307387178|5.0|The book is well-written, but this protagonist is just a spoiled kid.  I did not grow up in a well-to-do family, so maybe that was why I do not understand him.    He wasted so much resources that most kids never got!      I really hope to provide to my kids what his parents did for him.  I really really my my kid does not become another spoiled, reckless child.
B00004YYDI|5.0|i do not know why but this movie has been my favorite since the first time i watched it. i was 10, i just do not get bored of it. i probably watched it over 20 times. I love Jean Reno and Natalie Portman, i would watch any movie either of them is in. I love V for Vendetta as well but no matter how many movies i watched i never could say that this movie is better than Leon - The Professional.    If you havent seen it you should!!!!!!!!!!!

0143038419|4.0|I know there are a lot of people who don't have anything nice to say about the author or this book, but I am not one of them.  I found this book poignant and inspiring.  It is the story of one woman; a woman who was lost and found a way to rediscover herself and take control of her life.  I didn't find it to be self-absorbed or preaching in any way.  The book is a journey, which happens to be spiritual.  I believe anyone who has experienced great loss or grief can relate in some way.
B00133KFGW|5.0|The 5 stars rating goes to the movie itself and not to the DVD which besides the deleted scenes has no other extras.<br /><br />A very touching movie about a talented boy that grows up as an orphan and deep in him he is convinced that his parents are still alive and he is going to meet them one day<br /><br />The movie is somewhat predictable yet it will really touch you. At times you are tempted to use the remote control to see how the movie ends. I am not sure if this is due to excitement to see what is going to happen or because some parts of the movie are a bit slow.<br /><br />Parents in particular will enjoy this movie.
B000WCBPOG|5.0|It´s has been ages since my last review of a product on amazon.com. However, I felt I needed to write about the deluxe version of \\"Across the universe\\". This soundtrack is amazing, with the best covers of Beatles´ songs ever recorded. It´s great to see how talented the cast of this movie is, starting with Jim Sturgess, who is a great actor and an outstanding singer. He sings with his soul, interpreting the lyrics of the songs. I like his british accent, which fits perfectly to the music composed by the Beatles. Dana Fuchs has a powerful voice and her recordings make the movie even better. The song selection was perfect for the movie and each song becomes meaningful on the context of the story that is told. It works as if the songs were characters on \\"Across the Universe. I love this deluxe edition because it brings almost all the songs of the movie, besides a booklet with good pictures and the lyrics to all the songs, which is rare nowadays. The soundtrack also has the collaboration of Bono Vox, Joe Cocker and Salma Hayek. It´s hard to make comments on Beatles´songs, because they are all great, but I especially like the versions to \\"All my loving\\" (lovely!), \\"I want to hold your hand\\", \\"It won´t be long\\" (it sticks to your head like a bubble gum!) and \\"Strawberry fields forever\\" (very emotional).It´s not a surprise that this CD is one of the best sellers on amazon.com. Don´t think twice...buy!
B000E5KJF2|3.0|Great video quality but the praise is hard to find after that. The movie has a few interesting moments and the odd bit of humour but overall, IMO, it just doesn't deliver, it is very bland and easily forgotten.
B000WQ9UA8|4.0|I´m a fan of Britney since the very beginning. Not long ago, Britney was the pop princess, with hits like \\"Baby one more time\\", \\"Stronger\\" and, more recently, \\"Toxic\\". The innocence is gone. After an unhappy marriage and 2 kids, Britney is back in the music scene with \\"Blackout\\".This is the worst moment of her life and her career and it´s a pity she can´t promote this album. \\"Gimme more\\" is an instant hit and radio stations never get tired of playing it.The second single, \\"Piece of me\\", is an answer to the midia, which is trying to destruct her career, as well as the paparazzi, who turn Britney life in a daily hell.But there´s more. \\"Toy soldier\\" is a cool track, and would make a better third single than \\"Break the ice\\". \\"Radar\\" and \\"Hot as ice\\" are two of my favorites. As a true fan of Ms. Britney Spears, I really wish she can recover and get her kids back, because she is a real entertainer and a pop star, which is not destined to fade.
B00012FXAE|4.0|There is a constant variable that one can always depend on when viewing a James Cameron movie. Much like death and taxes, it is pretty much required that one check their brain in at the door like a suitcase before boarding on one of his films. The continual pounding bombast will render you dumb anyway, in much the same way as being hit continually over the head with a blunt object would, and the caricaturing of the characters will to a moral certainty, not require any deep thinking to understand them as true life individuals, since they don't have any actual real substance or complexity to speak of. For many people, Aliens is one of the greatest film experiences of the entire 1980's, with its grand climatic design, powerful action sequences, and visually stunning special effects, it's easy to understand the appeal this film has on the masses. But for pain in the neck people like myself, who's brains don't simply shut of like a faucet, the experience is more problematic then it is profound. There is no great mystery to why this is the way it is, it's simply that some of us desire a bit of seduction with our media, and James Cameron only knows how to take by force. Since I can admit that I am the odd man out as far as Aliens mass appeal is concerned, I figured I would focus my review on building a grocery list of observation from the outside looking in. My oppinions may not be the most popular around, but hopefully they will make an interesting read.    The film starts as nearly 60 years pass, Ripley is found floating, the ship long blackened, her glass domed sleep capsule covered in a heavy wet silver dust. It is here that she is salvaged, and for a New York minute, there is actual mystery to the story.    At a docking station orbiting the Earth, she learns of her daughters death...Her daughter aged, she did not. After her recovery, she is humiliatingly court-martialed and subsequently stripped of her flight officers status because of blowing up her last star freighter. She learns of the colonists on the alien egg infested planet, becomes assertive and irate. In fact, her assertiveness would make a good drinking game, but only if you kept the drink to watered down beer and only drank it from a shot glass. I tried to keep track of how many times she acts self righteous and asserts her views on the other characters by force. With a good hour left to go in the film, I had already counted nearly 50 such incidents. Even though I did want to submit an actual number for this review, there is simply too many outburst to determine an actual factual count. Often her outbursts would happen in back to back sentences during the same on going conversation. I was uncertain about whether I should consider the whole conversation its self as one outburst, or single out each and every time she blew her top. Finally I decided to admit defeat and wave the white flag. Ripley is such a hot head, that a better drinking game might be to focus on the films snazzy one liners.  \\"They can bill me.\\" Ripley  \\"Game over man!\\" Hudson  \\"Have IQ's just dropped sharply since I've been away?\\" Ripley  \\"Why don't you put her in charge?\\" Hudson  \\"She's dead okay, can I go now?\\" Newt  There is probably enough snazzy one liners to make an Irish dock worker pass out in your stair well, but that is still a better option then drinking yourself to death to Ripley's explosive behavior.    Once the court-martial is over she becomes a dock worker herself, but not for long, because she is informed that indeed, the colonists seemed to have vanished completely from the alien planet. Her flight officers job is dangled before her eyes like a carrot, but only if she goes back to the planet of the aliens as an advisor for a colonial marine force unit.  \\"I don't believe this!\\" she says incredulously.  That's funny, because neither did I. But I guess they wouldn't have a movie if the story fallowed actual logic. I'm sorry, but sending a traumatized person back to what caused the trauma in the first place, and on a space ship, after she blew up the last one she flew on, is one hell of a stretch. Also, it is one thing for her to go with them and orbit the planet, but she joins them on the combat drop to boot. And why is it that there is no one left on board the giant mother ship? Would they really send every person down on the drop ship and not even leave one single person to man the combat star freighter that is left double parked orbiting the planet? So much for strategy, I guess they don't mind placing all their eggs into one basket. There is an interesting comment from Sigourney Weaver on the disc two making of features, in which she states that James Cameron is a big believer in gun control. It is an odd statement when one takes into account that the combat mother ship which is designed by Cameron himself, looks like a giant pump action shot gun. Also, between Aliens, the Terminator films, and Total recall, he fired off enough rounds to win a major war.    Proud to be a Spunkmeyer.    When you are always right all the time and aggressively show it, the forces of good give you what you are lacking most. Not in real life mind you, but in skewed all explained to you for-shadowed pay off movie logic. In this case, Ripley was pining for her long lost daughter and presto! She gets an instant replacement daughter just like that. It's the Spunkmeyer's of the world that don't get any second chances. In fact, if you are in a James Cameron film, and your character name happens to be Spunkmeyer, then you are too much of a dork to even get to have an onscreen death scene.    Building better worlds...Same lousy mouse traps.    In the extended version of Aliens, Hudson, played by Bill Paxton, goes on a rant about all the nifty things his weapon can do.   \\"Check it out! Independently targeting particle beam tactical smart missles...Check it out! Phase plasma pulse riffles...Check it out! Sonic electronic ball breakers...etc.\\"  Yeah right Bill, but when it comes down to it, there is nothing advanced about the weapons that they are using from the ordinances that we currently have now. Here we have a Sci-Fi premise that is so futuristic that space travel is a common practice like riding on a Grey Hound bus. The human race has colonized possibly hundreds of planets, and we have been mining alien worlds for mineral and ore for centuries. Hyper sleep has been in use for God knows how long, and machines have been built that can process an entire planets atmosphere and make it breathable for humans in mere decades. Yet, in all this advancement, we have the same lousy mouse traps and clunky flack vests and helmets.     Did you hear the one about Columbus asking The Arawak Indians for directions?    Also of interest, is the fact that Hudson makes an illegal alien joke to a  very stereotypical hispanic caricature named Vasquez ( Jenette Goldstein ), which in the context of this futuristic setting, means that Hudson is cracking 500 year old jokes. As you can see from my above sentence about Columbus, such a joke would be logically long outdated, and is thus out of context in Aliens.     Hicks and Ripley sitting in a tree.    Where James Cameron is masterful at depicting combat and action, he is surprisingly inept at knowing how to flatter the female form with his camera work. Sigourney Weaver is an actress that stands nearly 6'1\\", with legs all the way up to her shoulders, and yet, somehow, someway, he manages to make her look dumpy in her only panty clad moment in the entire picture. Hey, I have to hand it to old james, because I doubt that I could pull that feat off even if I tried. With the lack of actual sex appeal throughout this feature, Cameron, not surprisingly resorts to weapons and armor as his ownly means of sexual expression.   \\"Where do you want it?\\" Ripley says seductively to Hicks ( Michael Beihn ) and Apone ( Al Matthews ), while in full body fork lift, and carrying a huge crate.  But it is with Hicks that Ripley has her real flirtations, and in this obvious way, we now have our family unit of mommy, daddy, and child in tact, albeit, all with different Christian names. What is so comical about this flirtation sequence, is that it revolves around Hicks weapon. I am sure that some of you know the weapon prayer that was used in Full Metal Jacket \\" This is my weapon, there are many like it but this one is mine...\\", well, when I did my stint in the service, we use to have that prayer hanging up in the armory in its entirety. I use to get a kick out of reading it to myself and replacing the word Weapon with Penis. It's a childish game I know, but so is the courtship between Ripley and Hicks.  Ripley, while holding Hicks weapon. \\"Show it all to me.\\"  Ripley \\"What'll I do?\\"  Hicks, while leaning into the weapon. \\"It'll kick some.\\"  Hicks \\"Get another one in quick, slap it in hard, You're ready to rock and roll.\\"  Ripley \\"What's that?\\"  Hicks \\"I don't think you want to mess with that.\\"  Ripley \\"You started this, show me everything...I can handle myself.\\"  Hicks \\"Yeah, I've noticed.\\"    Caricature development.    Unlike real life, the characters in Aliens are completely readable. There is zero ambiguity to their motivations, likes or dislikes. Everything they are, feel, or think, is warn without mystery right on their sleeves, and as such, we know who is mad at who and why. In an attepmt to hide the fact that the invented people are two dimensional, Cameron gives some of them tiny moments of redemption, and in one case, has one of them act pitiful. It is Hudson who acts like a baby, but this is not to show actual traits of human complexity, but is strictly for comic relief. The sole purpose for Hudson's character to even exist in the film in the first place, is to give the audience members somebody to laugh at.  Hudson later redeems himself by fighting heroicly to the death while outnumbered by hordes of aliens. LT. Gorman, played by William Hope, is hated by Vasquez for choking in theline of action, but of course redeems himself in her eyes so that they could both die together as side character martyrs. Likewise Bishop ( Lance Heriksen ), redeems himself by proving to Ripley that some androids can be trusted. Of course it's never a good thing to be one of those characters that prove themselves in any film structured around obvious for-shadowing plot devices, especially when James Cameron is the writer and director of it. Vasquez and Gorman blow up, Hudson gets swarmed by aliens, and Bishop gets ripped in half by the queen alien. And if you are a smarmy little weaseling rat like Carter Burke ( Paul Reiser ), then you have to look like one, act like one, think like one, and talk like one. If only real life were so obvious. Ultimately it is the handling of the characters that bothers me most about Cameron's films. It is the lack of actual genuineness of the caricatures, and their predestined evident behavior that I find fallacious beyond redemption.   For even if we examine a common behavior sydrome like passive aggressiveness, it would carry with it a long list of bevaviors that would not show in a direct readable way. Things like fear of dependency, fear of intimacy, obstructionism, fear of competition, feeling victomized, sulking, making excuses and lying, harboring ill feelings for those they depend on, procrastination are just some of the complexities that exist with passive aggressive behavior. I know that Aliens is just a croud pleaser, but it could of been a much deeper and more satisfying one had any real human behavior been utilized, and not just plot device and comic relief behavior.    The Alien franchise is typical of retreads. With all the Lovecraft like mystery in the original, it is no wonder that I rate it a near perfect five on my scale. There are a few gripes, most notably the fact that the alien could grow so big so fast without a food source, but at least it remains mysterious, and most of the characters have motivations thatare hidden. It is also a film that manages to stay suspenseful, not only for what it decides to show, but just as importantly for what it doesn't show. In this way, the original let the audience members fill in the blanks with their own imagination. It is ironic that when I consider each installment of the alien films after original, that I find myself docking a point off of each one from its predecessor. Aliens, I rate as a 4, Alien 3, a 3 ( and I don't own it ). Lastly, part four in the franchise I rate as a 2, an have only bothered to watch that installment one time. I can give Aliens its due for almost pulling off the upset and outdoing the original, but at last, its very attept at agrandizement sealed its fate as the weaker movie. The overall lack of subtlety, mystery, and believable humanity, ultimately hindered what is one of the better designed Sci-Fi thrillers from being a five star movie in my book.

B0010YSD7M|5.0|All I can say is, \\"Wow!\\"  This film was a lot of fun and while the ending was just a little contrived it did what was intended: tied up the Ori storyline so the team can move on to other adventures.  First, let me say that I'm not one of those people who thinks the Sci Fi Channel was doing the bidding of Satan by cancelling Stargate SG-1.  It was time, in my opinion, for the long-running series to leave the air.  The Ori storyline, which I never liked, was dragging on forever and it seemed the writers of the series were just rehashing old sci-fi plot devices to fill out a full season.  Second, this film goes a long way to redeeming the Stargate franchise and reminding us just how great Stargate was in its heyday.  The only missing link in this film was an appearance by Richard Dean Anderson's Jack O'Neill.    One of the major positives about this movie is that each character gets his or her moments to shine.  Tel'c especially has a wonderful scene with Tomin in which they discuss the terrible things they've done and about the idea of forgiveness.  Probably was one of finest moments for Christopher Judge in years.  Another stand-out is the character of Cam Mitchell.  In his two years on the series I never really warmed to this character, which always surprised me since I'm such a huge fan of Ben Browder's performance in Farscape.  In this movie, I think the character really comes into his own as an individual and a leader.  Of course, Sam and Daniel have their great moments, and the saving grace of Stargate's final two seasons, Vala, is as funny and dramatic as ever. Claudia Black is truly an underused actress. Her scenes with Tomin (played wonderfully by Tim Guinee) are some of the best in the movie.    It goes without saying the special effects were as good or better than the series, which were already fantastic for something made on low-budget cable money.  It's also worth mentioning the music was great and reminded me a lot of the music in the original Stargate movie.    This is not the best film for new viewers of Stargate, but a nice prelude that catches you up is included on the DVD, so new viewers shouldn't stay away. What this film does is tie up the loose ends from season 10 of Stargate SG-1 and allow for the beginning of some new adventures.  I eagerly await the next film, Stargate: Continuum.
B0015HS5TA|4.0|As a big fan if screwball comedy I was looking forward to Miss Pettigrew Lives for a Day, but I had no idea how much American Cinema has missed the fun of those days.  Very much a comedy of manners, this story is a fresh look at that nostalgia with a little more honesty than the Hayes Commission permitted in the 30s.<br /><br />The character of Delycia Lafosse (the proverbial \\"ambitious\\" actress) could have been played by Carole Lombard, but now we have a new special personality in actress Amy Adams who does very well, thank-you--and she can sing.  Like Lombard, she looks durable rather than fragile--fetching but human, stunning in her imperfection--and, as charming as she is, she looks like she can take it.  If she continues to choose her roles well, she could usher in a whole new genre.  Perhaps thanks to his TV experience, Director Bharat Nalluri's penchant for close-ups allows us to see Ms. Adams as a real person.  There is a world of difference between them, but It is not a stretch to see Delycia looking into a mirror at her future in Miss Pettigrew (Frances McDormand).<br /><br />Frances McDormand's greatest strength is to bring her considerable life experience to the screen with aplomb and perfect timing.  She is sublime as usual in yet another quirky character where she proves that she is among the best actresses of our time who hasn't played Queen Elizabeth.<br /><br />There is a night club scene that could simply have been a recreation of a Fred Astaire movie, but the Cinematographer (John deBorman) established an atmosphere allowing the viewer to feel the excitement and the glamour and the tension.  It made me yearn for sophistication and gentlemanly behavior, where tuxedos actually fit, where sex took place sometime after the last song rather than on the dance floor, and where a disagreement amongst men did not involve \\"nines\\" and people who \\"have your back.\\"<br /><br />One particularly memorable effect that I have to mention was, from nowhere, the sound of bombers flying over London.  It was so out of place that at first it sounded like a nuisance from outside the theatre--then you realized that this must have been how eerily shocking it was for those whose lives were about to be interrupted by WWII.  It was a small point that left a large impression.<br /><br />The only thing that could have made a significant improvement in this joyful experience would have been casting Clark Gable and Spencer Tracy opposite these suburb actresses.  If only . . .  George Clooney can't do everything.<br /><br />Perhaps one of the reasons for my enthusiasm about this film is that I saw it in the Lido Theater in Newport Beach, California, a restored building from the period, which cannot help but enhance my pleasure.  But, thanks to the close-ups,  this movie will probably play on an IPod.London.

0525950079|4.0|If you enjoyed Pillars of the Earth, you will almost certainly like this sequel.  It is virtually identical to the original.  The setting is the same and the time frame is not significantly different enough to matter.  After all, what is the difference between 14th and 12th century England?<br /><br />It is almost amusing to hear from those that argue that this novel is somehow inferior to Pillars of the Earth.  The only possible reason that this might be the case is that after reading 1,000 pages about Kingsbridge, some readers might suffer Kingsbridge fatigue.  In fact, if forced to choose, I would argue that the sequel might be in some ways better than the original.<br /><br />We're dealing with the same town, in roughly the same period in history.  There is a different Earl, different bishops and priors and slightly different peasants and town folks, but not different enough to matter.  The sequel, however, contains a brief sojourn to the continent and includes story lines dealing with the Bubonic plague, both welcome additions to the original.  For those that favor the first novel, I would argue that had they read this book first, they would much prefer it instead.<br /><br />As with Pillars of the Earth, the writing in this novel is highly reminiscent of Edward Rutherfurd's novels Sarum and The Forest, both of which deal with the same region and historical era.
0525950079|4.0|I love a good long book and Follett never fails to keep the reader's interest.  The historical parts were fascinating, but I did find the 20th century dialogue a bit odd.  The word \\"pregnant\\" didn't even exist back then, and I found the men's interest in the particulars of womens' lives to be a bit unrealistic, like the fantasy of soap operas.  I also get tired of the obligatory rape scenes Follett always has.    What surprised me were the modern parallels.  The bridge collapse can be compared to our Minneapolis disaster this past summer and the \\"God wills it\\" mentality is what our soldiers in Iraq tell us they're dealing with over there.
B000P0I4OY|4.0|There seems to be a lot of hate for this movie, which, like some others here, I don't understand.  I don't claim this would be the best movie you've ever seen (hence the 4 stars here, rather than 5, and for some perhaps even those 4 stars are being generous), but I don't think it's that bad either.<br /><br />Premise is simple enough with John Cusack's character trying to connect with his son and taking him out for a camping trip that just happens to have both of them crossing paths with an 'exterminator' (of humans) in the form of Morgan Freeman's character.<br /><br />Much of the film was made in the Pacific Northwest and it helps to provide some awe inspiring scenery in the background.  Some viewers would complain though that where that scenery is there should be more action or more dialogue.  Personally I'm happy to watch the scenery and let the movie unfold.  No, it's not that quickly paced, and yes, some things are telegraphed from what seems to be miles away (making things a bit too predictable), but the story was enjoyable enough to make me want to see it again.<br /><br />I must admit, my purchase of the movie was somewhat inspired by Morgan Freeman being in the movie.  Though there are plenty of movies and roles he's been in that I wouldn't go out of my way to see, his role here seemed to fit him nicely and I think he did well with the part he was asked to play.  (There are movies he's been in that you couldn't pay me money to watch again, such as Driving Miss Daisy, yick!, and others that I just never cared to see...)<br /><br />Rated R for language, female nudity, and violence.
B0010X73ZG|5.0|I was very pleasantly surprised when I saw this movie one Sunday afternoon during a matin&eacute;e showing. I have never read the Stephen King book but was very pleased with this movie. The characters may have been a little too cliched for me at times but overall, they were entertaining. Acting was superb (if not over the top at times).<br /><br />This movie showed the monstrous things that were going on OUTSIDE of the mist and in the supermarket. It spoke about facing the unknown and how we react to it and how we are capable of doing just about anything to survive and take care of our loved ones.<br /><br />The ending for me was actually acceptable. I never saw it coming. It wasn't a typical \\"American movie\\" ending.
B0008KLVG4|5.0|\\"You're going to need a Bigger Boat...\\"<br />On February 11,2008, more than a month ago, Roy Scheider, the actor who said the famous line in this enduring classic monster film passed on to the next life. What better way to wrap up my horror \\"reviewing streak\\" than to pay tribute to one of the lead actors in the best monster film ever made. I will review this as a film made in 1975 and not in 2000, it would be unfair to review a classic as modern one.<br /><br />JAWS (1975) is the first film to reach the $ 100 million dollar mark, surpassing \\"The Exorcist\\" and even \\"The Omen\\". I've always said that the best horror films are the ones that hit close to home, with factors anyone can relate to. \\"Jaws\\" made a lot of people so afraid to go into the water. Masterfully directed by Steven Spielberg, based on Peter Benchley's novel which was inspired by the New Jersey Shark attacks of 1916 dubbed; \\"The Summer of Fear\\". The film is truly an enduring classic and such a phenomenon. It proves once again that you don't need demons, vampires, werewolves and boogeymen to induce a good scare.<br /><br />Amity Island is an isolated place where tourism is the townsfolk's bread and butter. Families on summer vacation go to Amity (means friendship?) to have a great time. A series of deaths that could have been committed by a huge shark threatens lives and the town's well-being alike. Chief Brody (Roy Scheider), with the aid of marine biologist; Matt Hooper ( Richard Dreyfuss) and a shark hunter named Quint (Robert Shaw) has to overcome bureaucracy, and their emotions to bring the 25 ft. monster down.<br /><br />Everyone knows the film's plot and premise, honestly, I've seen \\"Jaws\\" countless times. I first saw the film on television back in 1980 (too bad I was too young to see it in theaters); I was a child then. I can tell you that the film is so well-directed and effective that even an 8 year old could feel the chills and excitement. So what made \\"Jaws\\" so great? The haunting music, the feel of the unknown in the beginning, the well-rounded and interesting characters, and of course, the giant Great White Shark. The film was fated to be in the annals (yes, Chris, I said it again LOL) of excellent film-making; some of the awesome ingredients weren't done by intention. The shark wasn't seen in the first half because the mechanical model wouldn't work, who would think that this setback would prove to be the film's strongest gimmick? Thankfully, the filmmakers didn't give up and kept on with the production. Spielberg was in his twenties when he made the film, who knew that he would become one of the most renowned directors of our time? \\"Jaws\\" had the hand of fate working for it.<br /><br />The characters in \\"Jaws\\" are actually the ones who really carried the film. The performances by its cast headed by the trio of Scheider, Dreyfuss and Shaw \\"clicked\\" so well; viewers can easily form an attachment to them. Scheider is a cop who left the city for a small town to avoid the dangers of urban cop life; he hates the water and who figured that he'd come face to face with a 25 ft. shark? Dreyfuss is a marine biologist with a passion for sharks; he loves them and studies them relentlessly. He uses his own money to fund his research most of the time. The most interesting character for me is Quint, played by Robert Shaw; he's a shark hunter who seems loosely based on Moby Dick's Captain Ahab. Quint apparently had a traumatizing experience involving sharks during his tenure in the USS Indianapolis. All the lead characters have a link to the star of the film: \\"Bruce\\" the mechanical shark. Although \\"Bruce\\" may be a bit dated by today's standards, but trust me, this film is timeless, not because of its special effects, but the excellent script, direction and well-developed characters. Gosh, even the boat called \\"Orca\\" is a character in itself.<br /><br />Add the award-winning musical score by John Williams, the film definitely exudes intimidation. Obviously, Spielbergand Benchley had some disagreements on the script but everything worked so well that even though the film had major differences from the original book, I would easily forgive its differences from the source material. I truly thought that the film was made with care and creativity. There is no wasted moment in its proceedings, even the supporting characters carry a lot of depth.<br /><br />\\"JAWS\\" was so successful that it spawned 3 sequels and a lot of knock-offs such as \\"Orca The Killer Whale\\", the Italian spin-off; \\"Great White\\" a.k.a. \\"The Last Jaws\\", Tentacles, Piranha and many others. The film is definitely one of the most brilliant, defining moments in film. It is a timeless masterpiece, which will undoubtedly endure forever and make future generations afraid to go back in the water.<br /><br />It will forever be the measuring stick for all future monster films. `nuff said.<br /><br />HIGHEST POSSIBLE RECOMMENDATION! [5 stars]<br /><br />This review is dedicated to Roy Scheider....script but everything worked so well that even though the film had major differences from the original book, I would easily forgive its differences from the source material.

B000E6UK5K|5.0|I really sorry to say that this album will put you to sleep as compared to his two previous solo efforts which I think were very good.
B000002UAR|5.0|Paul McCartney and John Lennon were the best song writing duo ever and that is without a doubt, thus this album is one of the best ever. Not one filler to be found here. George Harrison starts it out with my personal favorite Taxman and it just goes from there. Outstanding lyrics with Paul and John never sounding better.
B000WZAE1I|5.0|Stardust is a movie about a star who has fallen to Earth and the multitudes who are bound to possess her. It is an unusual tale told in familiar settings. Charming, delightful, romantic, exciting, and smart are all apt descriptors for this new classic that seemed to barely get noticed in the theaters. The sets and effects are terrific, the acting is wonderful, and the two protagonists are quite endearing. Of special note is Robert De Niro's performance as the Dread Pirate Roberts (not quite, but almost.) There's nothing to not like about this tale.<br /><br />See it. You'll be glad you did.
0375424474|4.0|Your Inner Fish is a very broad book, tracing nearly all of our body parts back billions of years. While I always thought fish were the least interesting of all the species (I'm currently a freshman biology student at Bellarmine University), after reading Shubin's book I have a new found connection with all sorts of animals. A walk through the zoo is an amazing new expierence after reading the book.    Most of the book is very interesting. While you may think a book on evolutionary biology and genetics would be stale, lengthy, and boring, Shubin breathes life, excitment, and personality into the book, keeping you interested the whole way.    The only reason the book didn't get 5 stars...It's written very basic. While this may be good for people who know nothing about genetics and evolution, it feels very dumbed down for the rest of us. Nevertheless, it s a very good book worthy of a read by anyone.

B000Y5JFLQ|4.0|One of the big arcs of the \\"Stargate SG-1\\" series was finding the Lost City of the Ancients, also known as Atlantis.<br /><br />It also turned into fertile fodder for a spinoff series (come on, you KNEW they had to make one eventually), known as \\"Stargate: Atlantis.\\" The first season has its duds and awkward moments -- much like its parent series -- but it proves to be a solid introduction to likable new heroes, a legendary city, and a new race of alien parasites.<br /><br />At the Antarctic base, Daniel Jackson (Michael Shanks) has finally figured out the location of Atlantis -- in the Pegasus galaxy. General Jack O'Neill (Richard Dean Anderson) gives the go-ahead for an exploratory unit to go to Atlantis -- even though they don't have the power to return back to the Milky Way, and will be stranded there.<br /><br />So Dr. Elizabeth Weir (Torri Higginson) leads an international group of scientists and military to another galaxy, and arrive in the sunken Ancient city of Atlantis. Unfortunately, after ten millennia Atlantis is running out of power, and soon the whole place will flood. The military unit, including Major John Sheppard (Joe Flanigan), goes scouting for a planet to evacuate to, and encounter the friendly natives.<br /><br />Meanwhile, the irritable scientist Rodney McKay (David Hewlett) tries to somehow salvage the city -- only to have it rise from the ocean floor. But then the SG teams accidentally wake an ancient enemy -- the parasitic, vampiric Wraith, who destroyed the Ancients long ago. Cut off from Earth, the expedition settles into the Ancient city and tries to make the best of their situation.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the Pegasus galaxy has plenty of its own dangers -- an energy-sucking \\"shadow,\\" possible spies, life-sucking bugs, a destructive nanovirus, a mysterious goddess, suicidal kids, cannibal Wraith, and an Amishlike people who turn out to be ruthless soldiers. And the Wraith are closing in on Atlantis, intent on getting to Earth -- forcing Weir and Sheppard to arm the city for what may be its final stand.<br /><br />\\"Stargate: Atlantis\\" has an easier introduction than most series, even spinoffs. The whole idea was introduced over a few seasons of \\"Stargate SG-1,\\" and two of the characters (Weir and McKay) were also recurring characters. And thank God, there is no endless whining about how they may never see Earth again, as many series would do -- the Atlantis personnel just forge ahead, and deal with it.<br /><br />It does have some flaws, mostly the same ones that \\"SG-1\\" had in ITS first season -- a few duds (\\"The romancing of the alien priestess? It's very 1967 of you\\"), and many others that are good sci-fi watchin', but not great. It takes a little time for the series to get comfortable, but by the last four or five episodes, it really takes off.<br /><br />And it has plenty of sci-fi staples -- ugly nasty aliens, tightly wound scientists, little tubular ships, explosions, moral quandaries and a bit of classic-style horror. But it doesn't lose its laid-back style (Rodney massaging his feet during a conference), or its human side -- for example, one episode has everyone recording touching messages to send back to Earth.<br /><br />And the dialogue is pretty great, with lots of one-liners and snappy exchanges. Most are from Rodney (\\"This device must be using an older version of Windows\\"), and Sheppard (\\"I am your death. That is all you need to know.\\" \\"I prefer 'Steve'\\"). But there's humor from everyone (\\"Find another problem with it! Tell him that the power-loop interface isn't jiving with your walkabout!\\").<br /><br />The cast is a bit uneven -- Higginson is given too little to do, and Rainbow Sun Francks just never works. But Flanigan has a nice O'Neillian sarcastic snap, Hewlett is hilarious as the mildly antisocial, ever-exasperated scientist, and Paul McGillion is simply adorable as a cuddly Scottish doctor. And while Rachel Luttrell starts off as just the token native love interest, she evolves nicely at the end of the season.<br /><br />\\"Stargate Atlantis\\" has its shaky moments, and the actors were still getting a grip on their roles. But it's a solid first for a solid sci-fi series, gating out into a new galaxy.ts, and the actors were still getting a grip on their roles.

B000X5KSWM|5.0|I'll make this brief. I completely enjoy Tarja's voice. It has power, warmth, and all those things that make for an outstanding voice. This album is superb and she's proved that she is better off without her old band. Some of us already knew that. I await the next album!
B000SO7OM0|5.0|Loreena McKennitt and Sarah Brightman are my personal favorite diva, goddess & genius. Each in her own way hold the key to popular success without having to compromise the essence of their art. Also, both artists produce riveting filmed concerts--granted, in very different styles. Brightman is highly theatrical with impressive technical--almost athletic--effects;  Loreena Mckennitt's performance is contemplative, yet not at all introverted.<br /><br />In the Alhambra Concert DVD McKennitt wears little or no make-up. Her strawberry blonde hair flows like a halo, her face is luminous.<br /><br />Loreena singing & playing her Irish harp is a lovely sight indeed.<br /><br />Amazingly, this fantastic concert DVD is thrown in as a bonus gift (this is true of all McKennitt CD's.)The songs selected just happen to be all my personal favorites, including The Lady of Shalott (Tennyson) and McKennitt's own The Old Ways. Other stunners are The Mystic Dream & the daemonic themed Stolen Child. But this is not a \\"best of best\\" CD. All the old favorites are given completely new composition & interpretation by artists of the highest calibre. They deliver inspired work of their own because they have been obviously inspired by McKennitt--and this is just one sign of that \\"genius\\" factor alluded to above.<br /><br />This particular concert features an appropriately, heightened Middle East flavour--spiced up with with a little improvisational-like jazz. The opening tune The Mystic Dream with its jazzy, sexy saxaphone opening.<br /><br />All the accompanying musicians are outstanding, working as equal participants in an ensemble elegance.<br /><br />It is wonderful to hear these songs with new interpretations--it is even more inspiring to watch the actual performance.<br /><br />I would gladly pay this amount for any Loreena McKennitt production. This beautifully done package with 2 CDs & 1 DVD is an exceptional value.<br /><br />So impressed, I had to invent my own 6 Star Rating!<br /><br />[[ASIN:B000J233SK The Book of Secrets]]<br />[[ASIN:B000J233TE The Mask and Mirror]]<br />[[ASIN:B000J233U8 The Visit]]<br />[[ASIN:B0002VE1W0 Elemental]]<br />[[ASIN:B00000IL1K Eden (US Release - 16 tracks)]]and Mirror]]  [[ASIN:B000J233U8 The Visit]]  [[ASIN:B0002VE1W0 Elemental]]  [[ASIN:B00000IL1K Eden (US Release - 16 tracks)]]
0316067598|5.0|This book takes you on an amazing journey through the amazingly difficult training that every SEAL has to endure before earning the coveted trident metal. The SEAL training is what enabled Marcus and his fallen comrades to fight with unparreled gallentry against an inhumane emeny down the slopes of Murphy's Ridge. The wording of this book put me right next to Marcus and his fallen as they bravely fought--I simply could not put the book down!!     It is clear that the SEALS are among the elite of the elite when it comes to the best soldiers in the history of our world.     A heartfelt thanks to Marcus and his fallen brethren for confronting an enemy that embraces hate and sees no value whatsoever in human life.     In addition, a great thanks to our whole military for defending freedom and liberty.  Don Redden
1569242739|4.0|This was the first cookbook I bought after going vegan.  I always turn to one of these trusty little recipes when I find someone in my life who thinks vegans can't have anything tasty.  I love the pictures in this book too! Since making your food look as good as it tastes is very important (IMO), I found the abundance of pretty photos inspiring.  However, not every recipe gets its picture shown, and even though that's normal in cookbooks, I find it unforgivable in desert books!     I couldn't give this a perfect score because I selfishly wanted more pictures, recipes and there's the whole issue with Isa not really being vegan.  I would have past this book by if I would have known ahead of time that one of the authors eats animal products whenever the fancy strikes her.  It just seems a bit hypocritical to be making money projecting yourself as something you're not.
B00133KFGW|3.0|Plot SPOILERS now.<br /><br />Lyla (Keri Russell, of FELICITY), a concert cellist, and Louis (Jonathan Rhys Meyers), an Irish musician, meet on a New York City roof one evening. What with the moon being full, the two fall in love. And further shenanigans of the heart go down. But, the next morning, Lyla's controlling father speedily puts the kibosh on the romance before it really has a chance to flourish. When Lyla becomes pregnant with Louis' child and delivers, her father puts the baby up for adoption and tells Lyla that her baby had died. Louis's heartbreak and Lyla's tragedy cause them both to give up playing their music, even though Lyla would become a music teacher. So that was eleven years ago.<br /><br />Cut now to the present, as a young orphan named Evan Taylor (Freddie Highmore) flees the Walden County Home for Boys. Evan is a weird kid, able to hear music from the most routine of noises in his environment. But he loves music more than food and believes that his parents aren't dead, that, in fact, if he follows the music, it'll lead him to his parents. He ends up following the music to New York City, and ends up in the clutches of Maxwell Wallace, more flashily known as the Wizard (Robin Williams).<br /><br />The Wizard is an aging street hustler who takes in street kids with musical talent and makes them busk for a living (the Wizard gets a good cut of their earnings, you dig). Hanging out with the Wizard and his underaged worker bees, August Rush (as the Wizard would rename Evan) learns to play music for the first time, starting with the guitar. Further events unfold, and, soon enough, a pastor in church sees August wailing away on the pipe organ and is so impressed that he gets him into Juilliard. And from there it's a short step to this newly discovered musical prodigy conducting his own symphony to the New York Philharmonics in an outside concert in Central Park.<br /><br />So many coincidences here that Bollywood is jealous. So, meanwhile, Lyla has discovered that her son is alive and begins a desperate search for him. She ends up in New York. Simultaneously, Louis has regained the itch to play his music and rejoins his old band. He also ends up in New York. And, by the movie's climax, everybody ends up in Central Park.<br /><br />SPOILERS end.<br /><br />Here's my two cents: Let's not get it twisted, AUGUST RUSH is meant to be a fable. And you have to buy into the film being a fable if you're gonna enjoy the viewing experience. Otherwise, it may get on your last nerve. Is this movie manipulative? Yes. Is AUGUST RUSH so \\"sweet\\" a film that diabetics aren't medically cleared to glimpse even its trailer? Hells, yeah. Do coincidences pile on more ridiculously than L.A. traffic on the 405 Freeway? Fo'shizzle! But I'm still giving it three stars. Mostly, I guess, it's 'cause I'm a sap, a sucker, a target audience. I just dig feel-good films and pictures which cling to the idea (or wish) that there's a higher purpose to things. That love and magic and music can carry the day. That wouldn't exactly suck, would it? Sue me, I got that optimist schtick going on.<br /><br />But this is the part now where I kind of kick the movie in the groin. Thing is, man, are we ever asked to accept so many inconsistencies and leaps of logic. Yes, clearly AUGUST RUSH is intended to be a fantasy film, but even the most fantastical of fantasies must have some grounding, some rules to follow. AUGUST RUSH, in several scenes, just doesn't play fair. Since this is a fable, I get that Evan is able to suddenly, masterfully play the guitar (after messing about with it some during the night). I can swallow that. And the same with the piano. But I draw the line at Evan all of a sudden capable of composing maniacally after merely glancing at a music sheet (Is there, somewhere, a deleted sequence where he at least first studies notes and stuff for a bit?).<br /><br />Jonathan Rhys Meyers and Keri Russell punch in with some very good acting. And I truly wish they could've gotten more scenes together, as their characters are very engaging and rootable. The high points for me are actually the scene with Meyers and Russell having their cute meet and the scene with Meyers and Freddie Highmore dueting on guitars (easily the musical highlight of the film). Come to think of it, the musical sequences happen to provide some of the better parts of this film. And if Meyers is really doing his own singing, then color me truly appreciative. Freddie Highmore was pretty good in [[ASIN:B0007CNXUK Finding Neverland (Widescreen Edition)]] and in [[ASIN:B000BB1MI2 Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (Widescreen Edition)]]. Here, he's the eponymous lead, but his acting, while sensitive, borders on being too precious. Next time, maybe ease up on the ethereal. The other two actors of note are Terrence Howard and Robin Williams. Howard is woefully underused as a concerned social worker and Williams is irritatingly overused (Seriously, Robin, what the hell happened? You were a decent actor for a while.). But Howard barely makes an impact, while Robin Williams checks in with one big fat hairy false note after another. He really doesn't do a good enough job of sinking into the skin of his role. So, when all's said and done, all I see is Robin Williams playing Robin Williams, and playing him awfully. I pretty much cringed everytime dude was on the screen.<br /><br />A bit of fine tuning here, a bit of scene cutting there (like, all of the Robin Williams scenes), and, who knows, this could've been a much better film (Another thing that grated on me was the sappy and too abrupt ending). Still, if you can buy the outrageous premise and tolerate the incessant cloyingness and the rampant sentimentality...If you can not be annoyed at the film's blatant and clumsy attempts to orchestrate the audience's emotions (since every film does this)...And if you keep to heart the fact that AUGUST RUSH is a fable and so deserves a break from the Department of Keeping It Real, well, you might end up enjoying this. Me, even though I'm a bit horrified at the sheer over-the-topness of it all, I'm still leaning towards being generous. I see that this film wears its heart on its sleeve, and I salute that. And that it decided to go all balls out for what it wants, and that it fully commits to its music. Respect to that. I give props to the movie's hopeful message, which is that music unites. I'm just glad Jonathan Rhys Meyers and Keri Russell were there to ground things. AUGUST RUSH, ultimately, ends up being flawed magic. But still magic.<br /><br />And, by the way, that nine year old girl, Jamia Simone Nash, is a star waiting in the wings. She's got impressive pipes.ruly wish they could've gotten more scenes together, as their characters are very engaging and rootable.

0007169582|3.0|This story held my interest, and was quite moving at times. It dealt very thoroughly with the emotions the widowed wife felt after the death of her husband. It made me think about how I would handle being her her shoes, as well as how I could help others in a similar situation. While it was thought provoking, at times it was a little boring, and at times I felt a little frustrated with Holly (the wife). But overall it was a quite sweet story with an overall pleasant message.
185984054X|5.0|Mr. Hitchens is 'preaching to the choir'. People always become very angry with me when I say that Mother Teresa is a religious crackpot. I could not see what she was actually DOING for anyone. She always seemed to be wavering between sadistic and masochistic. I also noticed how she was entitled to care she would not allow her patients to have. She seemed more a harbinger of pain and suffering in the name of Jesus than anything else. I too wondered what exactly she was doing with the millions of dollars donated to her over the years, she certainly was not using it to alleviate suffering. She always felt that suffering was to be endured and welcomed as a way to get into heaven 'kisses from Jesus' she calls them. I call it torture, and it should not be tolerated under the Geneva Convention.  golson
B000YXMMAE|5.0|The songs in this album are deep and beautiful. Sometimes sad. The lyrics are less political and more personal than in the other records of the band. Emotional and moving. It's softer than \\"Hail to the thief - The Gloaming\\", and yo need to enter in it little by little. Thom Yorke sings so sensitively as ever and the sound is brilliant, creating an emotional tension around each song. \\"All I Need\\" is my favourite one, it has a bass line that penetrates my ear and my soul, and leaves me armless. But all of them are great.  I'm still a Radiohead fan!
B000002OX7|5.0|Seriously.  You're not voting this album 5 stars?  Huh?  Don't make me write a long essay.  If you don't like this album, you REALLY should question yourself, and what you're doing on any page discussing this album.  Just face it YOU DON'T GET IT, BUT MILLIONS OF PEOPLE DO - so stay in your own arena, and leave the judging up to others.    By the way, do also you hate chocolate? Or sex?  Or sunsets?  Just trying to figure out your other pathologies.....
B000Y7ZHCU|5.0|I don't know what more to say about this dvd that other fans haven't said already, but you have to know how brilliant this is.  If you were fortunate enough (like me) to have seen this concert in person, then you will want a copy for sure.  It's the next best thing to being there and an amazing souvenir - it beats any programme I ever bought at a concert.  She sings almost every song you could want to hear again and you get a good idea of the set changes and wonderful dancing in the background.    I don't think I can add upon what other reviewers have written - I just want to be another fan and concert goer that is trying to explain how phenomenal her voice, music and concert are.  Grab a copy.  It's a must.
B000YIGNKE|1.0|Let me state up front that I have never read Jane Austen's novels but I've watched almost every version of her novels put to film.  I was confused in places when I watched for the first time the 1995 version of Persuasion with Ciaran Hinds and Amanda Root, but a second viewing clarified -- and I've watched and loved it many times since (however, I've mused that this version would have been even better than it already is had Andrew Davies written the screenplay).  I love to watch the subtle play of emotions on the characters' faces, which reveal the thoughts and feelings people of that era would never utter aloud.  I was so looking forward to watching Rupert Penry Jones' Captain Wentworth in this new rendition of Persuasion because I loved him in his small but memorable role in the excellent film, Charlotte Gray.  But I was disappointed in the entire production, especially in the casting of plain Sally Hawkins.  I would never for a moment believe that Penry Jones would be attracted to, never mind pine for, her.  I was also disappointed in Penry Jones' rather wooden performance (though I think he had the deck stacked against him by the screenplay and the way this film was shot).  I found the final scene of Hawkins running through the streets ridiculous and her way-too-long-lead-up-to-a-kiss with Wentworth contrived.  A second watch did not change my assessment of this film.  What most disturbed me about it and the other new film versions of the Austen novels released this season (Mansfield Park and Northanger Abbey, although I thought Northanger Abbey the best of the three; I haven't seen Sense and Sensibility or Emma yet) is that everything feels forced -- the action is too fast and \\"choppy.\\" Sally Hawkins is plopped onto the back of the carriage like a sack of potatoes, versus the subtle caress of Ciaran Hinds' hands on Amanda Root's waist as he helps her into the carriage, followed by the embarrassed expression on her face as she looks back at him and as he turns away to hide the caring his action revealed.  Time and time again in the 1995 version, you can see the subtle emotions on the characters' faces because the camera lingers appropriately.  This is only one of countless moments of genuine feeling that is totally lacking in this new version.  Is it that we're losing in our increasingly fast-paced results-oriented world -- reflected in many current films -- the ability to let life and feeling unfold according to its own natural rhythms?  I was not persuaded that the characters in this new version were real at all.way to hide the caring his action revealed.

0060512806|2.0|Have you ever hated yourself for finishing a book? For a long, long month, I resisted my own desire and my wife's urgings to drop the book. I should have listened. The book badly needs editing, the characters are shallow, and the author's (very) high opinion of himself stains the pages. There are two crypto-analytic themes to this book: World War II codebreaking and the struggles of a modern day cryptographic computer company to turn profitable. By page 500 (of the 910), I had no idea how they related; by page 700, I had an inkling but no longer cared. I only finished because I felt some undefined need to do so.      I would guess that by the time Stephenson wrote this book, he had enough critical and financial success that he was able to demand no restraints from his publisher. Consequently, the writing meanders and much of it is irrelevant. Stephenson dedicates three pages to description when three paragraphs (and sometimes only three sentences) will do. Worse yet, many of these wanderings are completely unrelated to the story, such as discussions of Captain Crunch and wisdom teeth. By page 300, the reader can see when these airy insignificances arise, and to continue, he or she must painfully wade through them.      Most of the characters in the book share the exact same personality: gruff and cynical. The exceptions are academics, who are portrayed as wimps with no grasp on reality, and East Asians, who all have a personality similar to the characters from Shogun. Otherwise, a World War II Marine shares the same personality as a modern day billionaire-investor who shares the same personality as a modern day entrepreneur. An example of the same-flavor feel of Stephenson's characters: One character (Enoch Root) was an Army Priest during World War II and dedicated himself to peaceful causes afterwards. By the time one of the modern characters encounters Root, in a jail cell in the Phillippines, Root (who must be at least in his mid-eighties) has been running a Church in the Phillippines for a number of years. Nevertheless, Root describes the goddess Athena as a virgin who was \\"leg-f***ked [] once but did not achieve penetration.\\" This same character uses the word \\"dissed,\\" just like any modern fifteen year old boy. Character development, needless to say, is non-existent in this book.     On the plus side, Stephenson has encyclopedic knowledge and an expansive vocabulary. Even this becomes a turn-off, however: Stephenson's writing reflects a man who thinks of himself as intellectually beyond the realm of mere mortals. Perhaps he is different in real life, but he comes across as the geek in high school who justified his social-ineptitude by the fact that he got great grades (especially in math!). That same geek who got great grades lost many arguments because he lacked intellectual and logical skills outside of \\"book learnin'.\\"      Stephenson is like that: For example, he ticks off a long list of German and American technological advances during World War II, but then concludes that the Allies won because America stood for technological advance while Germany stood for mindless warfare. In another story line, Stephenson's modern day protagonists set out to create a data bank near the Phillippines that is protected by the most advanced cryptography in existence. These protagonists are some of the most brilliant computer code-writers and cryptographers in the world, and they are attempting to set up a company which hides information so well that even governments cannot access it. These same brilliant people are shocked to discover that criminals are keenly interested in the project. Again, Stephenson has incredible knowledge but weak logical skills.      Why give the book two stars instead of one? There are some redeeming aspects of the book: I liked the aspects of cryptography and analysis, a subject to which I have never paid much attention. Any book that I can learn from cannot be all bad.

0375842209|5.0|This book was incredible from the first page to the very last page.  I loved every single character but my favorites were Liesel, Max, Hans, & Rudy.  I did not want the book to end because I feel like I miss these characters.  They kept me company everyday on the train to and from work.  Even though this story is set during the Holocaust and the subject matter is very heavy, it was interesting to hear it from Death's point of view.  Also, the flow of the words and the tone made me feel like I was an invisible person really looking in on the lives of these characters.  I recommend that everyone who has heard of this book should take the time to read it.  You will love it or at least like it very much.
B000002AS3|5.0|I was 19 when this album came out and this defined my generation.  Columbia is the best song ever!!!!!!!
B000P12LWY|5.0|As a genealogist and history buff I immediately figured out this is not history but entertainment-of course I, along with others, also wonder why the writers don't use the truth when it fits just as well as blatant inaccuracy. In any case it is entertaining and sumptuous, I think. Clearly the historical Henry was a selfish, egotistical spoiled sociopath-JRM portays this fairly well-The actor who portayed Edward Stafford, Duke of Buckingham, would have made a perfect Henry, red-haied and robust. If you are into the series in a big way, get the DVD as some of the scenes are cut! For instance, the scene with Henry and Anne FINALLY getting it on. In the cut tv version, one can't really figure out why Henry gets his way only to stomp off in a rage. The fellow is never satisfied. Finally I will watch the series avidly if for no other reason than to see that fine, fine, fine Henry Cavill. Keep an eye on HIM!!! As a note of interest, Charles' Brandon's granddaughter was Lady Jane Grey, who was beheaded by Bloody Mary-her parents were Frances Brandon and Henry Grey.
B000000OAH|5.0|Wow. Simply, wow. This album slams you from the very beginning of the first song, \\"Mustapha,\\" and keeps beating you over the head mercilessly with Queen's absolutely masterful rocking. The entire album is one of their most cohesive, and highlights all the members' insane musical abilities, from Brian May's intense guitar work (\\"Dead On Time\\" is an excellent example) to Freddie Mercury's piercing vocals. This album is just good fun and good music. Queen's tongue-in-cheek sense of humor is rampant (\\"Let Me Entertain You\\" and \\"If You Can't Beat Them\\"), and this album is polished and sharp in its manic pace.  This album is for the listener looking for an album to just let loose and rock out to. It's not a casual listening album, but it is guaranteed to entertain you, no pun intended! With the possibility of redundancy on my part, it's GREAT!
B0011ZNAIC|5.0|This is an adorable movie that made me laugh out loud on several occasions.  It starts pretty strong with good clean humor that was above my 6 year olds head, although he enjoyed it for different reasons than I did.<br /><br />Jerry Seinfeld and Renee Zellweger give stellar voice performances.  Jerry's his usual comical self, but it's Renee who really impressed with her expressive talents.  There are several fun cameos - Oprah offers her voice as a judge, Megan Mullaly takes us on a tour of the Honey Factory, and Chris Rock is a misquito \\"Mooseblood\\" to name a few.<br /><br />The movie has some fantastic messages for both kids and adults.  Think outside the box, take chances, find yourself, and also explains the importance of bees and their function on earth.  My son enjoyed learning about the distribution of pollen, nectar and how bees make honey.<br /><br />It drags a few times in the court scenes, but revives itself before the ending.  And by dragging I'm talking minor speedbumps.<br /><br />The music is enjoyable and kids will love watching the bees take flight and traveling along with them.  It's great for both boys and girls.
B00006AGGY|4.0|Reign of Fire brings to the screen the unlikely scenario that ash-eating dragons will take over the world and humanity will become near extinct as a result.   It is the year 2020 and an isolated community in England trying to survive in the dragon dominated world is visited by an American military force bound on bringing an end to the reign of reptiles...  Don't look for the movie to make any sense; it doesn't.  Christian Bale, Matthew McConaughey, Gerard Butler, Alexander Siddig (from Star Trek DS9!), the lovely Izabella Scorupco, and the rest of the cast carry out their performances well though the acting is nothing extraordinary.   The setting, the plot, the dialogues, the special effects, and the music are all good.  In a nutshell, it's probably not a movie you would want to add to your collection, but it will provide for an evening's entertainment. 3.5 Stars
B000NUFVO2|5.0|I belong to a web site (Cybernation i do believe it's called) and they send you a \\"quote of the day\\".  You know, something to keep me upbeat and on the road to success and that.  So I got a quote today by this Mackeray gentlman.  And it says that he's a british arthor.  So what I do is go to www.amazon.com and look him up to see if he's recently written a book or two.  He's been dead for a while but he has written this book that I'm reviewing.  Actually, I'm not reviewing it cuz i didn't read it but i got to tell you the quote really hit close to home.  something about loving foolishly is better than not loving at all, but loving wisely is better than anything.  how true....how true.  thank you and may this review be helpful in someway to someone out there.
B00133KFGW|5.0|I don't have much to say other than it was one of the best told stories I've seen in a long time. The music is addicting.
B000001GY9|4.0|I'm kind of annoyed by the Hurwitz-ism at the top of this review section. Professional music-writers (or popularizers--whatever he is) really should rise above the hyperbolic--let's leave that to us bone-headed amateurs. The Mighty Hurwitzer propounds that these symphonies have (I'm paraphrasing) never been better played or recorded or something--the implication being that this is the best you can get. Hm.    If you love these symphonies you really should be exploring a variety of interpretations, and if you do you'll note that a goodly clump of them are particularly good (and the specific contents of that clump will vary from enthusiast to enthusiast). That's just the way this works. I like Gardiner's period instrument set, the Paray on Mercury Living Presence, the recent set done up by Christopher Eschenbach, the forgotten Vonk on EMI and a few others, including the earlier Bernstein set. Eschenbach is new and beautifully recorded; it lacks the--uh--indulgent touches that Bernstein brought to many of his recordings, including this one.     ... and it's those indulgences that prevent me from giving this a five star rating or the kind of singular accolade Hurwitz is able to bestow. Any Schumann fan should own these--they really are remarkable and often very exciting--but be prepared for oddities, lingerings, sudden speed ups (the skyrocket ending of #4 is particularly annoying) and--well--the Bernstein usual. I've always felt that these symphonies have a kind of built-in natural momentum that a good conductor has to sense and follow--you tag after Schumann, he doesn't tag after you. Lenny brings a lot to any interpretation but there's always the sense that the composer is being squeezed between the \\"Bern\\" and the \\"Stein.\\" This particular show could be renamed \\"Lenny Bernstein's The Schumann Symphonies.\\"    One other thing is lost: these are hellraiser performances at the expense of good old Schumann/German Gemütlichkeit. \\"Lenny\\" has every excitable emotion down patbut the schmoozy warmth is missing which, sadly for me, is 50% of my Schumann. He tapped into that much better in his earlier set.    Not a bad review, just an alert. I think Hurwitz is why I prefer the more level-headed (grown up?) comments one finds in the Penguin Guide or coming from British reviewers generally.
B000H7JCG4|5.0|I watch and collect lots of TV on DVD, and after watching the first season of Beverly Hills 90210 it is, by far, my favorite TV show. It contains everything that any good TV show should: great acting, characters, storylines, and plenty of addicting drama.    From the pilot to the finale, each episode is worth watching over and over. The issues in the show are issues that trigger your emotions, make you have flashbacks, or help you go through the issues you may be going through now.     At the beginning, the show focuses on a family moving to Beverly Hills and trying to get used to the way people live, the danger of their new address, making new friends and dealing with issues that they haven't dealt with before.      I fell in love with these characters at first sight.   - Cindy and Jim Walsh are the best parents, they're understanding at times, but they are still 'parents'. They are trying to get used to life in Beverly Hills.  - Brandon Walsh is an easy going teen who everyone wants as a friend. He falls for a lot of girls and it sometimes gets the best of him, but he's a great guy.  - Brenda Walsh is Brandon's rebellious twin. She is very over dramatic, it's so funny to watch her.   - Kelly is Brenda's first friend in Beverly Hills. She seems like the very conceited and stuck up rich girl, but once we get to know her she is a great friend with a lot of problems, too.  - Steve is Kelly's ex boyfriend. He is a lot like Kelly, and seems like the stuck up rich guy, but there's a side to him that has feelings and a good heart.  - Dylan is the 'bad' boy that Brenda falls for. Jim doesn't want Brenda seeing him, but beneath the rough exterior, he is one of the best guys on the show with a rocky past.  - Andrea is who we think is the usual geek who takes a liking to Brandon. But as the show progresses, we can't help but love her!  - Donna is a part of the gang who is close friends with Kelly. It's hard to understand her sometimes because she's quiet, but through the showwe gain more respect for her character.  - David starts out as a freshman who can only dream of hanging out with the gang, a total geek. But in the end, David isn't so bad after all.  When these characters collide, love, drama, new friends and flings occur.     Some of the darker issues that come up include things that a lot of people go through: sneaking into clubs, losing virginity, cheating on exams, parents abusing drugs, marriages being threatened, date rape victims, discovering alcohol and drunk driving, even spending a night in jail, cancer scares, shoplifting, befriending someone who could actually kill someone, etc, etc, etc.    But it's not all drama. There are some light subjects to balance the issues out: moving to a new town, rescuing someone from dorwning, beach parties, secrets that come out at slumber parties, awful hair dyes, road trips, teens trying to rebel, and much more.    In the finale, there are very serious things happening. Will the Walshes have to leave the place where they've dealt with so many new things and made so many great new friends? A dramatic break up occurs, is it the end? The cliffhanger that occurs in the final moments of the finale will make you NEED to have season 2 ASAP!     If you are thinking about buying this season, you wouldn't regret it. I wish the show were still going today!
B00003JRCQ|5.0|For my money, this is the most faithful adaptation of this Austen book. I find the script flows more smoothly than in the 2006 version. The sequence of events is such that the characters' motivations are better explained. The cast is fabulous and truly capture the spirit of the book. Root's portrayal of Anne is subtle and sensitive, perceptive and mature. We see her bloom on the screen. The special connection between Anne and Cap'n Wentworth is palpable. I love that Wentworth is always in uniform and the scene in Lyme, strolling on the jetty is one of the most memorable in the movie. I just wish they had cleaned up the dvd transfer so the coloring on the dvd wasn't so dim. The production values could be better.
B000ZN8036|3.0|Hard to really understand why the lead character is so angry at his parents. Naive youth syndrome is the only thing I could come up with. You actually end up sympathizing with the parents because the kid puts them through hell while he goes off searching for himself.    Only redeeming message is the entire movie comes in the last few minutes with what I assume to be one of the last messages he wrote, \\"Happiness isn't real unless shared.\\"
B000YIGNKE|4.0|This remake has great production quality and an excellent cast. Rupert Penry Jones is perhaps the most dashing Wentworth I've ever seen (despite lack of uniform). The biggest disappointment is the script. Events have been shuffled around which takes away some of the nuances of the characters' behavior. I don't mind seeing a new angle but this version lacked cohesion and flow. Worst is the rewrite of the final 10 minutes. Wentworth's final letter to Anne is one of the most inventive scenes by Austen, but here it's been replaced by events which seem so contrived. You'll know what I mean. Still, the actors were convincing and the cinematography was gorgeous. I did enjoy the final scene at Kellynch Hall.

B0010X73ZG|3.0|Two things right off the bat can be said about this film.  #1. This is a real nail biting, genuinely scary apocalyptic monster movie.  #2. The last five minutes bring the statement in #1 in question.  I really loved this movie.  It had an intensity that has not been matched in a long while as far as thrillers go.  The characters were all excellent and those you are suppose to care about you actually do.  Which makes the filmmakers decision to conclude it the way they did really disapoint.  I am a huge fan of non-Hollywood endings, but the final moments in THE MIST are so completely bleak they tarnish the film and leave the viewer with a cold rock in the gut that makes the film unwatchable for the second time (it's hard to find truly good movies these days, but when one pops up it's usually the best the 2nd time around-IMO).  The ending is a fine example of either hate it or love it, and would have received 5 stars from this reviewer had the finale been tweaked a touch, and I do mean a touch.  It's a true shame to enjoy something so thoroughly (there are some real nail biting moments, the pharmacy scene was just flipping crazy) to have it culminate into something akin to a delicious piece of fruit with a rotten center.  Almost a fantastic piece of horrific escapism, THE MIST missed.
B000ZOXDFA|5.0|Elizabeth: the golden age is a very good moovie. I highly recomend it to everyone. The costumes, the setting and of course the actors are really good. This is a masterpiece of film hitsory. And as always Cate Blanchett delievers a splendid performance as Queen Elizabeth. Blanchett is one of the 21st best actorest, she never dissaponts.

I wish there was more content, hence the release of a part 2, but I want it all right now!! I hope that part 2 isn't just a contractual release with songs considered not good enough to be released the first time around....

B00133KHCY|3.0|I've noticed a lot of specs for blu-rays are missing from Amazon lately. Used to be that Amazon listed everything on these. Now, they don't want to tell us, because they know we won't pay these overblown prices for movies that should have incredible content, especially on a Blu-Ray. I ran into this issue with August Rush. The movie itself is fantastic, but the BD only comes with additional footage NOT included in the film. WHERE ARE THE FEATURES? They don't have any \\"making of\\", which was what I wanted to see and no commentary track. Why are studios being so lazy with these releases? They have 50GB of space available for a reason. Not just uncompressed sound and high def picture, but for features as well. So great movie 4.5 stars, but poor excuse of a Blu-Ray disc 1 star.
0446577391|5.0|I read the first installment of David Baldacci's \\"Camel Club\\" series and was not overly impressed. It was tedious and the plotting was mediocre at best. I skipped the second novel in the series and, for reasons unknown, picked up the third.<br /><br />  Wow! Can this guy write! The characters are more fleshed out, the plot is one surprising twist after another and the climax is anti-climax followed by a smashing finale. I really, truly did stay awake all night to finish this.<br /><br />  Oliver Stone is a former CIA assassin living in the nation's capitol, making sure the Republic is kept out of evil hands. Having lived in a tent in Lafayette Park across from the White House for several years, Stone now lives in cemetery caretaker's cottage. (Oliver Stone, by the way, is an alias and the play on the conspiracist director is deliberate.) Assisting Stone in his gargantuan task is the Camel Club, three other misfits, Reuben Rhodes, Milton Farber and Caleb Shaw. Joining them is a con artist on the run, Annabelle Conroy, the youngest of the lot. At one time, all of them were forces to be reckoned with, now they are aging has-beens.<br /><br />  In less capable hands, this cast of characters would be unbelievable. In fact, in the first novel, they were unbelievable. But Baldacci has refined them, each and everyone, to the point where they do indeed appear perfectly capable of meeting the challenges that face them, not as supermen, but as friends bound to one another and wiling to sacrifice themselves for their friends.<br /><br />  Threats abound. Annabelle ripped off a ruthless casino owner, Jerry Bagger, for $40 million and he is seeking revenge. At the same time, Harry Finn, a threat assessment analyst contracted to various government agencies, is killing off retired CIA assassins, who murdered his father. Add to the mix the villainous Carter Gray and Senator Simpson, who used to be Stone's CIA superiors, and you have a very, very busy novel of close calls, danger, thrills and suspense.<br /><br />  And Balducci brings it off without missing a beat. The characters, as noted above, are flawless. They are real. They have fears. They make mistakes. They do brave things. (And, of course, they are fortunately lucky.) Balducci's plotting is magnificient. He pulls rabbits out of hats and you do indeed believe that there was a rabbit in that hat.<br /><br />  Balducci lards \\"Stone Cold\\" with an array of fascinating facts and factoids. (Did you know, for instance, that the staff of a United States Senator has 20,000 square feet of office space? Do you have any idea of how much that costs taxpayers?) These facts all play a part in the story and my hat is off for the way Balducci pulls it off: he is as good as Tom Clancy was, when Tom Clancy was at the very top of his form.<br /><br />  The plots and sub-plots are easy to keep clear and things move enjoyably quickly. The climax turns out to be anti-climatic and Balducci goes on to end the book with a - forgive me - bang.<br /><br />  A truly terriffic thriller that could very likely keep you awake all night. It certainly did that to me.<br /><br />Jerryalducci brings it off without missing a beat. The characters, as noted above, are flawless. They are real. They have fears. They make mistakes.

B000MRAAJW|4.0|This series is just beautiful to look at and educational also.  Occasionally  the narration jumps locations fast enough that by the time you figure out where in the world you are, you jump again. It has the splendor of an IMAX, and can breed the same sort of hopelessness also. What a wonderful world we live in!

B00133KHCO|5.0|August Rush looks like kind of a wacky movie from the jacket description. We were surprised at the refreshing humanity of it. The description talks about magic, but the greatest magic in it is love. It tells the story of a couple who is very talented musically.  Their talent comes from a passion they feel toward the music they hear around them, including the music from each other. This passion leads to a pregnancy, wanted by the girl, but unwanted by her father.  He's not a terrible villain.  He wants the best for her,and leads her to believe that her baby died during birth. The baby is a pleasantly odd little boy who hears the music around him. To the joy of the bullies in the children's home,he believes that some of what he hears is the music of his mother and father calling to him. The story unfolds as he leaves the home to search for the music. What unfolds has an echo of Oliver Twist, but not.  A wonderful movie!
0321544080|3.0|Joe McNally is sort of one of the heavyweights of the fancy type of National Geographic photography.  By \\"fancy\\" I mean he uses lots of lighting gear.  Everything is Elinchrom this, strobe this.  He reminds me of Louie Psihoyos.  Very commercial.  Slick.  Think Annie Leibowitz does National Geo.  I personally don't care much for that style but still found this an interesting read.  I prefer William Albert Allard and David Alan Harvey's style.  He has some interesting things to say and seems like a genuinely nice and funny guy (he has good taste in movies).    It has some shots from Life magazine, which honestly, I can't stand.  It's that whole \\"everything is happy happy\\" Life look, with supremely posed shots meant to look natural.  Anyway, I would recommend it to someone who is perhaps and aspiring young shooter who wants to do that kind of photography:  lots of lighting gear, multiple bodies around your neck, bags of gear.  It's not for the fans of Jim Stanfield, Bill Allard, Sam Abell, etc. who may have spent months shooting a subject with minimal gear for that \\"classic\\" NG look.  This is more for people who probably like Fashion shoots for the equipment but maybe don't like the subjects that much and want to shoot something with a little more depth.
B000LXHK2C|5.0|Like A Walk in the Clouds, this is a movie about a man who thinks he wants one thing, but finds that he really wants something else.  A London Trader takes a trip to France, where he's inherited property, meaning to sell it, but rediscovers his love for the land, the people, and himself. The people have unique characteristics, and the viewer grows to love them with the main character.
0061186422|2.0|This small anthology contains 10 short stories and one bad poem.  It clearly presents itself as a children's book (for \\"ages 10 and up\\" according to the flap), and many of the stories were apparently selected for elements that many superficially associate with Children's Literature, such as child protagonists, a sentient toy, a heroic animal, a mythical creature or some nursery rhyme references.<br /><br />However, the pretence that this is a Children's Book is a cynical marketing deception.  With the possible exception of \\"The Witch's Headstone\\", none of the stories here were originally written for children, nor have any been substantially altered for that audience.  I did notice that at least one story (\\"Troll Bridge\\"), had received some very minor editing to remove some of the more blatant adult language and references (which in no way detracts from the tale anything of value, IMHO), but it remains a highly adult-themed (and disturbing) tale.<br /><br />But the most inappropriate thing about this book is its promotion of suicidal ideas.  The worst offender is \\"October in the Chair,\\" which starts with a boy running away from home, and ends with his decision to throw away his life in pursuit of the sanctuary of the graveyard.  This could be read as a horror story - and I suppose a healthy child would indeed be horrified by it.  But it does not read as horror.  It reads as a dark fantasy -- an advertisement for child suicide.<br /><br />Suicidal themes are further explored in \\"Troll Bridge,\\" which is not quite so bad as \\"October...\\" in that it at least suggests that a child might want to wait until he has some experience of life - which mainly means experience of sex - before he ultimately and inevitably decides to throw away his worthless life.<br /><br />\\"Witch's Headstone,\\" the last story in the volume, also adds to the theme, but indirectly.  It is about young boy who lives in a graveyard under the protection of its apparently-benevolent ghosts.  The graveyard appears as a (somewhat bleak) sanctuary, while the living world outside is portrayed as evil and threatening.  I do not object to this positive portrayal of a graveyard sanctuary, since there is no indication that our hero got to this juncture via suicide (in fact, he is refered to as the \\"live boy\\").  The problem arises because this appears in the same volume as \\"October...\\", and the situations are so similar that it almost that it might be a sequel.  It seems to resolve the ambiguous ending of \\"October...\\" in favor of the idea that the suicidal act at the end of that story was a good idea.<br /><br />Nonetheless, I might have thought that \\"...Headstone,\\" viewed strictly on its own (rather than as a follow-up to \\"October...\\"), was a tolerable kids' horror fantasy, containing some genuinely imaginative and creepy situations.  However, it contains yet another terrible flaw.  One character, who the author clearly intends as sympathetic, is the ghost of a witch who, as revenge for her execution, curses an entire village to a painful death.  Wait ... sorry - it was not quite the ENTIRE village.  \\"Just those that watched me get burned and drowned,\\" explains this mass-murderess (with a shrug) when our boy hero inquires on this issue.  That seems to make it okay in Gaiman's mind.  In short not only does Gaiman suggest (in \\"October...\\") that our kids ought to kill themselves, but he also suggests (in \\"... Headstone\\") that they might want to slaughter half the community on their way out, on the flimsiest of justifications.<br /><br />Setting aside the volume's unsuitability for kids, and viewing it simply as a slim collection of adult stories, it remains a mixed bag.  \\"The Price,\\" about a mysterious stray cat, is the best story here.  Others, such as \\"Troll Bridge\\" are memorably horrific and disturbing, though I hesitate to call them good.  Still others, such as \\"The Case of the Four and Twenty Blackbirds\\" and \\"How to Sell the Ponti Bridge\\", are just pointless tales that trytoo hard to be clever, and fail.  Many of the stories (even \\"The Price\\") are underdeveloped  - Gaiman seems to think that not finishing or adequately developing a story is a good way to create an illusion of depth.  Almost all of the stories here can be found in earlier, larger, collections (The best ones are from SMOKE AND MIRRORS, while others are from FRAGILE THINGS).  The only advantage to this slim volume is that it spares the reader exposure to some of Gaiman's more degraded dark fantasies.<br /><br />Still, the stench of moral decay is not absent here, and virtually all the stories display a disturbing indifference to morality.  \\"...Blackbirds\\" celebrates the principle that one must \\"look out for number one.\\"  When, in \\"Troll Bridge\\", the hero offers first his sister, then his girlfriend, to the troll in order to ransom himself, there is never any clear indication that the author feels that he ought to have behaved otherwise.  \\"...Ponti Bridge\\" celebrates the glorious achievements of a con-man.  \\"Sunbird\\" seems to celebrate, as though it were merely funny, a happy-go-lucky rascal who casually murders all his friends (for unexplained motives) in the course of obtaining immortality for himself.<br /><br />\\"The Price\\" is the closest thing to an exception.  The protagonist is a coward, as always, but the same cannot be said for the mysterious, self-sacrificing Cat who suffers for his sins.  It is the only story here that strongly suggests the possibility of Good as well as Evil, and that is why it is my favorite.he stories (even \\"The Price\\") are underdeveloped  - Gaiman seems to think that not finishing or adequately developing a story is a good way to create an illusion of depth.

0575081384|2.0|I'm always suspicious of reviews that are out of line with the majority. So I wonder: What did I miss? After a promising start it got to the point that it became obvious that nothing of interest was ever going to happen. A little action wouldn't have hurt anything. Yawn.
B00133KFGW|5.0|i saw august rush yesterday i brought the dvd it was excellent a great story to it great acting and great cast
1594489505|5.0|I found the author's previous book, The Kite Runner, very compelling, but I absolutely loved this book about the relationship of two women living in Afghanistan.  It was so moving to see how the women survived and triumphed, each in her own way, through incredible hardships, in a culture in which they were at the mercy of an abusive husband.
B0010YSD7M|4.0|This was a good movie and an awesome episode. It was a (story wise)rushed but very good wrap up of the SG1/Ori story arc. The special effects and CGI were first rate.
B00005NI5Y|3.0|I'm a fan of Dylan lyrically, but I have to get this off my chest. The man CANNOT sing. Whew, please don't crucify me now, he writes the most wonderful pieces of poetry. He should just recite it! My whole family saw him live last year, he had NO audience interaction and a terrible voice. But he's a legend of lyrics.  Also, Dixie Chicks and Sheryl Crow both do fantastic versions of Mississippi
1416955070|5.0|This book is whacked. Plane and simple, but trust me it's a good kind of whacked.  The kind that has fans as thick as the Harry Potter books--or dare I say even more then the Twilight Saga.  There's nothing off limits in Clare's Immortal Instruments series, and a reader can appreciate that.       Clary is our leading lady, who is soon to realize that vampires, werewolves, and faye are just the tip of the iceberg.  She's plunged into the scary reality of monsters when her mother is kidnapped by the evil Valentine (much like the evil Lord Voldemort).  Jace is the awesome man candy. Clare's writing proves that there can be more to the brooding male types.  Jace has had a hard life and behind that rude mask he throws up, he's hurt and damaged.  It's appreciated to get a male lead in a YA series that just doesn't stare and stalk people.    Each page is dripping in snarky wit and my favorite kind of sarcastic commentary.  It helps that most of the smart-alec talk comes from Jace,--yummy and witty is a lethal combination.  The other members of the cast have their own sharp tongues to add to the memorable one liners.  Speaking of the cast, if you want one that comes this diverse you can't ask for a better book.     Every character is so well done that each one finds a way into the readers heart, even if they turn out to be unsavory sorts. Your in for the inside jokes, subtle hints or actions is all you need to know that something profound has just happened.  My heart was running rampant with fear, adrenaline, anger, hope, joy, and love.  This is the one series that always makes my heart ache with emotion.      Even after many re-reads and all of the other books in between nothing comes close to the City of Bones.  This book is a legend, and it has every right to be.  With a non-stop plot that makes you stay up all night to finish the book--no matter how many times you've read it--this is one title you will not want to say no to.  Some readers may not like the turn of eventsbetween Clary and Jace's relationship towards the end of the book, but it's good in a shocking way that only Cassandra Clare would dare.   Who can say no to a good dare?     Sexual Content:  Kisses and making out, light amounts of homosexual themes.  And a dash of incest.     Rating: 5/5- Fabulous, a beautiful obsession!
B00005AQE8|4.0|\\"All Eyez on Me\\" is a very nice album, especially the first disc.  Disc two is filled with mediocre to good songs, but nothing exceeds good.  As a unit, this album is easily a rap classic.  2 Pac gives a strong delivery and thought-provoking lyrics on most every single song.  He is so many people's favorite rapper, me included.  He has a technique which captures listeners from the first line.  This album features classics such as \\"I Ain't Mad at Cha\\", \\"How Do You Want It?\\", `All About You\\", and the album's strongest cut, \\"Life Goes On.\\"  I wish Pac would have left his friends off of this album for there are way too many guest appearances and many of them were apart of his group, The Outlawz.  They are alright as rappers, but they don't hold a flame or candle to 2 Pac.  Other guests include Snoop, Dr. Dre, George Clinton and K-Ci and Jo-Jo.  Each of these artists do a wonderful job with their contributions.  Most of the production on this album is very good.  It's one of the reasons this album faired so well with me<br /><br /> Rap fans, this album was released on February 12, 1996, so Lord knows it should already be in your collection, but if for some reason it is not, do add it immediately.  4 stars.<br /><br />Mikeisha's Top 5<br /><br />1. \\"Life Goes On\\"<br />2. \\"I Ain't Mad at Cha\\"<br />3. \\"2 of America's Most Wanted\\"<br />4. \\"All About You\\"<br />5. \\"Only God Can Judge Me\\"
0689865384|3.0|Yep. That's right I don't read sci/fi. I like the movies and stuff, but I've never gotten into the books. Also take into consideration I don't like anything this author has ever put out. I always start, but I can never make it past page one-hundred. I like this book. Even with silly little towns like: new pretty town, uglyville . . . I enjoyed this novel thoroughly! It only took me two days to read it.     The writing is Ok, just like the book. NOthing great or award winning, but not terrible. What got me caught on this novel though was the idea. That in the future people all become pretty. This means no one is jealous or greedy. Pretty much everyone becomes the same. While the plot is not mind blowing, but the idea and the way the main character finds herself in a world full of brainwashing is nicely done. The end of the novel, is actually, the most gripping part. Leaving you dieing to read the next book.     ****Fans of sci/fi, future books will love this. But those who only pick it up because a lot of talk about it, will probably just want to get it from the library. The idea is rich and refreshing and worth a try. Enjoy

B000ZN802W|4.0|After watching this film, the viewer may still have a difficult time understanding what the director, Mr. Penn, was trying to convey.  Is the film a morality tale about finding your way in a static and ultimately meaningless existence?  Is the lesson that a person should be happy with what they have and not mistake \\"paradise\\" as Dylan said \\"for that home across the road...?\\"  Or is it just the tale of an ultimately delusional kid that could never shake the emotional and psychological scars of a broken home?  Perhaps because the movie works at so many levels is its ultimate genius.  All throughout the movie I for one,  wish that someone would tell McCandless that there is plenty of room in society for a person that eschews traditional norms.  The closest person to express this is Mr. Holbrooke's widowed character, who incidentally is the last person that comes into contact with McCandless before Alaska.  Why McCandless decided to waste his almost unlimited potential by disappearing for a year and a half is addressed in the movie, but Penn and the screenwriter's give us no solid or concrete answer.  Overall, a movie that should be seen anyone contemplating leading this kind of life because eventually, and regrettably, Darwin (and not Thoreau or Tolstoy) won out.
B0010YSD7M|2.0|As a fan who has watched the show from the beginning and has loved it all along, I must say that this film was overall a disappointment.    But let me start with some positives.  The production values of the film were awesome, and I loved the location filming in the mountains.  The photography in this was quite beautifully done.  And the actors did magnificent as always.  I also liked the elements of the story involving Tomin and his facing the actions he took as an Ori soldier, with Teal'c being the one most interested in and capable of helping him through it.  This also gave Christopher Judge a chance to really show his dramatic acting capabilities, when most of the time his role is based more on physicality.    But beyond that, I thought that the film had three major flaws that detracted from the quality and enjoyability of the film.  One-the whole plot device of the Ark of Truth was an overly simplistic solution to the Ori problem.  Open a box, let a Prior see it, and all the Ori followers will see the error of their ways and be nice from now on.  Come on!!  I know that they had to come up with some kind of simplified solution to the Ori problem because they didn't have a whole season to wrap the story, but this was a just plain stupid idea!      Two-bringing back the replicators!!  As soon as I saw that metallic bug, I hung my head and went \\"Argh, give me a (bleeping) break!\\"  The replicators were a lot of fun for a villain back when they were first introduced, but at this point, they have just gotten old!  I'm sick of them!  They've almost become an excuse for them to bring out big guns with really big ammo magazines so they can show a plethera of clips of really loud guns being fired by really cool looking dudes!  They could've thrown in Jean Claude Van Damm and made this a B action film.  I think if they had focused on the Ori story instead of devoting a full third of the film to the replicators, the film might have been much better served!  Instead, I feltlike I had seen all of the replicator stuff before.  Of course, I had, in Seasons 4, 5, 6, 7, and a whole lot in Season 8!      Third-the replicator element brings us to the final problem I had with this film-Replicator Man!  At least, that's what I like to call the replicator-controlled zombie that Colonel Mitchell fights.  Through this whole sequence, I thought I was watching some cheesy zombie film mixed in with a little action-movie style fight scenes.  Replicator Man was a stupid enough plot device on its own, but then the sequence dragged on and on and on.  Only Ben Browder's whit in between the punches kept me even partially interested.    As I said, disappointing film overall that had some good points, but was rather poorly executed in terms of writing and plot.  Here's hoping for something better with Continuum.
B000002N25|5.0|This album blew my socks off when I first got it(many years ago) and I find that I'm no less impressed by it even today. Many great songs here---\\"Imelda\\", \\"Done With Bonaparte\\", \\"A Night In Summer Long Ago\\", \\"Vic and Ray\\", \\"Darling Pretty\\"--to name a few.A great release by one of the best songwriters and innovative guitar stylists of our generation.
B000NA1OXY|5.0|Got this album for \\"Keep Holding On,\\" the song that was featured during Eragon's end credits. \\"When You're Gone\\" and \\"Innocence\\" ended up being *bonuses* I wish Avril would write more heartfelt material like this...or whoever writes her material.    Otherwise, the rest of her songs have cheerful, upbeat melody, which contrast with the lyrics of her cussing at whatever dude(s) she's supposed to be talking about, or just dudes in general.    I just wish she'd kick the punk shtick, because I'm pretty much embarrassed to listen to the rest of the songs on this album, no matter by how much the radio's already ingrained them into my mind.    For someone who's supposed to be punk, why are her curses censored? She doesn't finish on \\"Sh..\\" \\"Bi...\\" or \\"Motherfu.....\\" \\"Hell\\" and \\"Damn\\" are apparently kosher, though.    I'll give the album 5 stars, if only for the 3 songs that ARE actually good. After all, I only bought the album for one song, and ended up getting 2 other good songs along with it.
B000TUXL2A|5.0|This new album once again proves that Mark Knopfler is one of the premier songwriters working today. These aren't just songs--they're stories. He makes you see the characters--like the Scaffolder's Wife, or the kid learning to waltz for the upcoming Christmas dance-- real people. Knopfler is a treasure in a world of throwaway junk.
0767834739|3.0|I'm a die hard RE fan.  So I'm use to the games more.  This movie was good.  Lots of action which is nice.  But it wasn't all that scary like the first one.  Playing RE: 3 last espace is so scary and I felt the film was lacking that. Plus they hardly showed Nemesis.
B0013FDM7E|4.0|In the genre of the post-apocalyptic type films \\"I Am Legend\\" has to be one of the best. This type concept in films is quickly growing old but this one feels like an original idea. I was hooked from the very moment I started watching.<br /><br />Will Smith does a tremendous job as a scientist who is seemingly a sole survivor in a world filled with infected super human creatures. As he tries over and over to find a cure for the virus he must endure living with no human contact. His only friend is a very loveable German Shepherd who keeps him sane. Day in day out he sends out radio messages for any survivors to meet him at a certain location where he patiently awaits until sundown. Once the sun goes down it is time to get inside and board up the house as the creatures come out and pray for sun up.<br /><br />I absolutely recommend I am Legend for anyone. I really think you will enjoy it even if you typically wouldn't go for this type of film.
B000ZINGIK|5.0|Scarecrow has different sound from previous avantasia-releases, and thus it can not be compare with them. This album sounds great and I think it can not be classified  just as a rock, heavy or power metal one, in here you can find a bit of these three basic styles. Every song is great. I have been listening power metal bands recently like Olympos mons, Black Majesty, Helloween, GammaRay, masterplan, ride the sky, heavenly and others that released an album at the ends of 2007 and  2008. These albums are great Power-Metal ones and some of them also deserve 5-star, but scarecrow is just the best between them with incredible songs and textures. You can take and be sure you are going to love it
B000QXDED6|3.0|My title say it all and after an extremely \\"talky\\" first half this film really takes off. Trimming the length about 15 minutes would have made this film much better. There was just too much(thee & thou)gibberish being spewed throughout this otherwise entertaining popcorn movie. The film does have an interesting look and the characters seemed to be leaping off the pages of a graphic novel. I just wanted more action and less B U L L #%$&*!
B0010358D0|2.0|This is the best unintentional comedy of the year! I spent so much time rolling my eyes that it hurt. The movie has poor writing and bad dialog, not to mention horridly awful attempts at character development. Do not make a drinking game out of this someone will die of alcohol poisoning in less than 20 minutes.  I started chuckling when I saw the talking killer but I had a hard time breathing when the Borg Cube showed up along with matrix drones. Not to mention the \\"go on without me\\" and \\"we're not leaving you behind\\" speeches as well as the collapsing fortress.  This movie is so bad it is a laugh riot! The movie is pretty though. If the characters had SOME charisma or the action scenes had some emotional anchor it might have elevated this movie to being a bad flick.  It does have one thing over the bad action movies of the 80's ... It is quite pretty to look at. I am glad I bought this it was the funniest thing I have seen all year! I can't wait to show it to my friends. This thing takes bad writing to a whole new level.
B000002TYX|5.0|Well, I give 5 stars ONLY and ONLY for Free as a Bird, which stands along with Dear Prudence, Come Together and other great masterpieces... it is just amazing how they managed to create such a great song having just an old tape with Lennon singing!... Also Leave My Kitten Alone deserves some attention... surprising it wasn't on Please Please Me or With THe Beatles... the problem is that without these two songs the Anthology isn't worth a penny, for it is a compilation of early performances, some of them even featuring Pete Best, so if you feel like spending 30$ on some history, go ahead, for those who expect something new and of good quality, better find Free as a bird single and you wouldn't be dissapointed...
B00004YRZ1|5.0|I'm noticing that this is the most-reviewed Cat Power album on Amazon (or at least in a close race with The Greatest), but I wanted to add my review to the pile because this is my favorite. It has \\"Maybe Not\\" which came out at a time where things in the world seemed a bit out of control, and out of the hands of the common person, and just said \\"we all do what we can.\\" I saw Chan's crazy free summer concert in NYC a few years back and while that show was chaotic fun (she stopped playing for a while to chase a squirrel around the stage, trying to feed it some bread), that song brought tears to my eyes. Anyway, this album also has \\"Good Woman\\" which is a simple, beautifully written song, and some of the best hooks, in my opinion, that Chan's written. But I like just about everything she does. (My screenname is a Cat Power reference, so there you go.)
B000000OAN|5.0|This album is great, it is masterpiece in all aspects... and I don't understand people giving it one star, for it's crime to grade such great music like this... definitely listen to it, for it's definitely worth it and this one of the best if not the best Queens album will live forever...

B0010YSD7M|4.0|For those of us fans of [[ASIN:B000TJBNHQ Stargate SG-1]] on the Sci Fi Channel, August 21, 2006, was a very depressing day.  Production had already passed the midway point of its 10th season, making it the most enduring science-fiction TV series in U.S. history after Chris Carter's  [[ASIN:B000UZDO5I The X-Files]], which lasted nine seasons from 1993-2002 on Fox TV.  (I was just as equally a fan of that one, too, and I look forward to the upcoming second feature film.)  That was the day that Sci Fi pulled the plug on our venerable \\"SG-1\\" as of the conclusion of season 10 in the spring of 2007.  \\"SG-1\\" ran from 1997-2007:  five seasons on pay-cable network Showtime and five seasons on the basic-cable network Sci Fi Channel.  Ten seasons on television is a venerable legacy no matter the genre, but to survive that long in science fiction is downright remarkable.<br /><br />Despite the cancellation, however, there was a ray of sunshine.  MGM (the production company) was eager to continue their very profitable franchise, as was executive producer Robert C. Cooper.  (Spinoff series [[ASIN:B000XEB160 Stargate Atlantis]] recently completed season 4 on Sci Fi Channel [as of this review date] and will return with the first half [10 of 20 episodes] of season 5 in July 2008).<br /><br />Thus came the announcement that \\"SG-1\\" would continue with at least two DVD movies, the first of which is this film, [[ASIN:B0010YSD7M Stargate:  The Ark of Truth]].  Filming occurred in their usual Vancouver, BC, soundstages as well as on location in the frigid Arctic in the early spring of 2007, and was immediately followed by the filming of STARGATE:  CONTINUUM, which will be released on DVD in July 2008.  The second DVD film will reportedly involve time travel and will feature the return of original \\"SG-1\\" series star Richard Dean Anderson as Col. Jack O'Neill.  MGM and Cooper are hopeful that continued interest in \\"SG-1\\" will fuel the fire for more DVD films with the \\"SG-1\\" casts (present and/or past).<br /><br />For those unfamiliar with the \\"Stargate\\" universe, the Stargate teams are a super-secret branch of the U.S. Air Force, in cooperation with participants from other nations, operating beneath the NORAD complex located at the Cheyenne Mountain complex in Colorado.  The real entrance to the complex is used for exterior shots.  The public at large, of course, has been prevented from learning that humans from Earth have contacted aliens from other planets.  The Stargate itself is a circular portal through which humans are able to walk through and almost instantaneously, via a form of wormhole, be transported to planets in other star systems.  The Stargate is powered by alien technology, and the discovery of the Stargate and contact with aliens explained why earlier human civilizations believed in many of the gods with whom we are familiar in popular mythology today.<br /><br />If you've never seen \\"SG-1,\\" you might be a bit confused by the complex mythology of \\"Stargate,\\" which really began with the 1994 feature film [[ASIN:B0000844I8 Stargate]], starring Kurt Russell as Col. Jack O'Neill (later played by the aforementioned Anderson, who left the show as a regular after the eighth season to be closer to his family in L.A.) and a pre-\\"Boston Legal\\" James Spader as Dr. Daniel Jackson (played throughout the series [with the exception of one season due to salary and the omnipresent \\"creative\\" issues] and also in this film by Vancouver native Michael Shanks).  Plotwise, the TV series' 1997 debut picked up one year after the feature film ended.<br /><br />Suffice it to say, if you don't know the show, that it would be a good idea to think back to 1986's [[ASIN:B000089QC9 Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home]].  It was arguably the most popular of the 10 feature films (which will become 11 films in December 2008 with J.J. Abrams' prequel to the original 1966-69 TV series, where we find the young Kirk/Spock/McCoy triumvirate at Star Fleet Academy) because it wasa basic, stand-alone story about saving two humpback whales whose survival literally also meant Earth's survival.  One needn't be a \\"Star Trek\\" fan to enjoy the so-called \\"whale movie.\\"<br /><br />In this film, the basic plot involves a threat to Earth by the evil race known as the Ori (\\"OR-eye\\"), who march across the galaxy and force entire planetary populations to submit to the Ori's bible, known as the Book of Origin (from which their name \\"Ori\\" is derived).  The Ori have the power to overcome virtually all that oppose them, and their retribution is swift and deadly.  The Ori are able to maintain their reigns of terror with the help of local representatives known as priors, to whom they are supremely dedicated and whom the Ori are able to totally control; or, resistance results in brutal retribution, with death and destruction in the Ori's wake.  Naturally, it's up to the SG-1 team to find the Ark of Truth, which holds the only known answer to eradicating the Ori before they reach Earth and fulfill their ultimate victory.  In a nutshell, it's your classic good vs. evil story, and it's a good one.<br /><br />It's also the proper conclusion to the Ori storyline, which basically consumed the bulk of the ninth and tenth seasons' storylines.  Because the cancellation notice came while the writers and producers were more than half-way into the final season, the series finale left fans (like me) feeling ultimately unsatisfied.  This DVD film basically wraps up that storyline.<br /><br />I promise that if you haven't seen the series, picking up the DVD will not make you feel like you've walked into a movie theater halfway into the film.  Like the \\"Star Trek\\" whale movie, it's a stand-alone DVD that you can easily follow.  You are just as easily able to determine who are the good guys and who are the bad guys.  Also, there's a wise addition of a \\"catch-up\\" sequence that provides clips from the series that refreshes viewers' minds of how we got to where we are, since the last new \\"SG-1\\" episode aired almost exactly one year prior to the release date of this DVD.<br /><br />All of the cast members from seasons 9 and 10 are here:  Ben Browder (who is currently 45 as of the date of this review; Ben was raised in Charlotte, NC) as Lt. Col. Cameron Mitchell (effectively Anderson's replacement); Amanda Tapping (42, from Toronto) as Lt. Col. Samantha Carter; Christopher Judge (43, from Los Angeles) as Teal'c; the aforementioned Shanks (37, from Vancouver) as Jackson; the seasoned veteran and always enjoyable Beau Bridges as Maj. Gen. Hank Landry (66, from Los Angeles, who replaced Don S. Davis, whose character, Maj. Gen. George Hammond, was \\"promoted\\" and shipped off to Washington, DC, at the end of season 7); and Claudia Black (35, from Sydney, Australia) as Vala Mal Doran.<br /><br />The core cast is superb as usual.  Black can always be relied upon for comic relief, especially when Vala is frustratingly torturing the patience of Shanks' Jackson.  Those of us who were addicts of the late and supremely, fantastically great [[ASIN:B0002VGSBM Farscape]] (1999-2003) still can't help but remember the chemistry that existed between Browder and Black, not Shanks and Black.  To placate some of the fans' very vocal ire at its cancellation, Sci Fi commissioned a two-night, four-hour miniseries in 2004, [[ASIN:B0006FO9B0 Farscape - The Peacekeeper Wars]], as a wrap-up.  The cost of producing the series in Australia, coupled with a drop in ratings in the fourth season, were the reasons given for the show's cancellation, but for its very dedicated fans, Sci Fi's excuses still ring as hollow today as they did then.<br /><br />The cast and writers tip their caps to a couple of other sci-fi franchises, as you might recognize one character as \\"Ah-nold\\" in a certain, um, poor state of existence; and then Lt. Col. Mitchell takes the helm of the Odyssey to fight the Ori and mangles the order to get underway to the point that would probably make Capt. Jean-Luc Picard absolutely blanch, pull his shirt down stiffly, turn and walk into his ready room, and bark \\"Earl Grey - Hot!\\" at the replicator.  Seriously, they're both nice touches and honor other sci-fi classics that have gone before.<br /><br />Prolific character actor Currie Graham (\\"NYPD Blue,\\" \\"Suddenly Susan\\"), who hails from Hamilton, Ontario, does his usual fine job playing the nasty guy with an ulterior motive.  This time his James Marrick is an agent from the secretive black-ops organization IOA.  He arrives under the premise of interrogating the captured \\"enemy combatant\\" Tomin (Tim Guinee).  The real purpose for his presence soon presents itself, however, and he puts everyone in peril.<br /><br />Reprising her role of Adria is the simply stunning Morena Baccarin, who fans of Joss Whedon's work will remember as \\"companion\\" Inara Serra in the woefully underappreciated 2002-03 Fox TV series [[ASIN:B0000AQS0F Firefly]] and its excellent 2005 followup feature film, [[ASIN:B000Q9IZ5C Serenity]].  Adria, the daughter of Vala, has been genetically altered by the Ori to grow from a normal baby into an adult incredibly rapidly in order to serve as their epitome (and far beyond that) of the term \\"demon child.\\"  The special effects used with Baccarin are quite impressive.<br /><br />And also reprising his role as the commanding and all-fearing Ori leader Doci is one of my very favorite actors, Britain's Julian Sands, who is barely recognizable under his ghostly and unnerving makeup.  With his cape, collar, and staff, he makes for an imposing and fearsome foe.<br /><br />The film, at 1:42, came across to me as what would have been a two-episode season-ending cliffhanger and season-premiere resolution, had they aired on Sci Fi.  In one of the bonus features, Cooper mentions that this film pretty much was written as such, since he didn't have the time to wrap up the plotlines because of the fairly late cancellation notice.  It wrapped up the Ori storyline, but that's pretty much all.  To that end, I wasn't exactly blown away.  Still, there was much to admire.<br /><br />Having admittedly acrophobic Chris Judge (as you'll learn in a bonus feature) dropped onto a knife-edge snow-capped mountain peak in the Arctic and have him, as Teal'c after being injured by an Ori weapon, trek along toward a destination he is determined to reach, is gut-wrenching, nerve-racking, beautifully executed, and exquisitely shot.  (That's one difference between the budget of an hourly TV episode and a [perhaps modest] feature-length DVD film.)  The Arctic landscapes are, to quote a heroic moonwalker some three decades ago, magnificent desolation.  Judge's performance in this film reveals the ever-growing quiet dignity that he has given Teal'c in the last 12 years, counting his recent \\"Atlantis\\" appearance.  Watching him struggle--injured, exhausted, in excruciating pain--to walk just one more step, and another, along a low-tide beach toward a holy city almost makes you feel his struggle come right through the TV.  His performance is exceptional.<br /><br />Ultimately, I enjoyed this film and am happy that the Ori storyline is resolved.  How it is done so, you must see for yourself.  It's a thrilling and enjoyable conclusion.  Season 10 on Sci Fi did not accomplish this, but STARGATE:  THE ARK OF TRUTH does, and satisfyingly so.  And the bonus segment with most of the core cast at ComicCon in San Diego, hosted by one of my favorite but underutilized supporting cast members--Gary Jones (Chief Master Sgt. Walter Harriman, best known for a few lines  such as \\"I can't get chevron seven to engage!\\" and \\"Unscheduled off-world activation!\\")--is absolutely hysterical.  If Gary doesn't do stand-up, maybe he should consider it, now that he has, er, some \\"free time\\" on his hands.  (I have seen him in a few guest-starring roles recently, though.)  The bonuses aren't numerous, but those that are provided are made to count.<br /><br />So sit back and enjoy, and don't forget!  In four months comes \\"STARGATE:  CONTINUUM\\" and \\"RDA\\" is back as Jack O'Neill!  Now THAT'S something to really get excited about!  :-)<br /><br />DVD REVIEW:  **** (out of 5) -- 17 Mar 08 (Happy St. Patrick's Day, all!) -- BOB BOURBEAUhis ready room, and bark \\"Earl Grey - Hot!\\" at the replicator.

B0000AQS6R|5.0|Maybe the best Vacation ever. If you are a Chevy Chase fan, this is a must have for your collection.
B00008G8LY|5.0|This is a very good movie, which came out in late 80s. It's by James Cameron, who was director of Terminator, Terminator II and Aliens. It's not as action-packed as those movies, but rather is a an intelligent movie with the equivilent amount of suspense, twists and surprises. The director's cut ending is a great plus, which wasn't available in the original release. If memory serves, this was a box office disappointment, but has become a cult favorite among Sci-Fi fans. If you like smart movies that make you thing and ask questions about our place in the universe, then you'll like this.
0790749815|1.0|I bought a copy at Amazon (a great company!) but the DVD locked up at the exact same place that everyone else mentions. Unfortunately, I didn't watch the DVD until after the return policy date expired. I tossed it in the trash. Wanting to finish the movie, I traipsed down to Spin City (Memphis, Tennessee) and bought another copy. Same thing! North by Northwest went South at the same point. This time I returned it in time. Needless to say, I didn't buy another copy, but I did buy some other movies (lost business for Amazon, I'm afraid).<br /><br />I hope Amazon doesn't allow any more sales of this classic until the problem is fixed. If they tell me it's fixed, I will gladly by a usable copy from them.  Happy Easter, Amazon.
B000ZLFALI|4.0|Julie Taymor's incredibly energetic homage to the music of the Beatles has an undeniable pop power, driven largely by an overactive imagination and those indelibly perfect songs.  I found the music to be truly affecting, gorgeously and creatively arranged and winningly sung by the game young cast.  The plot is really an excuse for production numbers and specific songs to make their way into the film, but as a loosely strung together series of such moments, darned if it doesn't start to become emotionally engaging.  The wonderfully anachronistic appearance of Bono as a trippy dippy new age psychobabbler delights, as does the almost unrecognizable Eddie Izzard.  It all moves quickly, and many of the visuals have the jagged, sincere look of a senior film school thesis.  But by the time everyone is singing Hey Jude and All You Need Is Love, I dare you not to smile...it's hard to resist!
B000ZN8036|5.0|I have to say at first I came to this film through Eddie Vedder (big Pearl Jam fan), and I'm very happy I did.<br /><br />I just watched the movie on DVD, and I have read all the other reviews here, which are much better than mine as far as going into details about the film, great camera work, the history behind the story, Sean Penn's ultimate vision and so on. So I'll just convey what this film did to my emotions, while the bruises to my senses are still raw.<br /><br />I was expecting to have a tough time watching this. Like most people who watched it, I knew the outcome, and felt I was prepared... I wasn't.<br /><br />I really liked this kid, and I felt in a way, what he felt as he went along exploring, whatever it is he felt he had to explore. In getting me along for the ride, this movie works on every level. And the way it brings us back to that buss, little by little, while telling the story leading up to it, jerks you in and out of danger so to speak, so when the final breath is exhaled, you, or atleast I, felt like I was are right there, helpess and unable to stop this from happening. And that's the crux of the whole thing to me, now, 12-15 minutes after the end credits. And when a movie does that to you... It's a work of pure art.<br /><br />To me.<br /><br />As for all the rest. I loved this actor, I loved the others, the hippie couple, the young girl, the old man, Vince Vaughn, the danish couple (I'm half danish, so thanks Sean, for having real danish people speak real danish in your movie!) and the sisters narrating.<br /><br />And on top of it all, there's Eddie Vedder, and it's just so good!<br /><br />Thank you for leaving my feelings raw like an exposed nerve. Feels good to be alive.
B000SM7QUC|5.0|This album has a fresh new rock sound, unlike any other album I've heard. It ranges from a slight hiphop/rock mix to piano/ballet mixes. It reaches every corner of the rock world that I love! Amazing guitars, thrashing drums, head banging combos with upstanding lyrics, and vocalist who knows how to put power behind his voice!<br /><br />If your looking for something new with some 80's rock influence, then you found the perfect CD! Just because it's a \\"Sound tack\\", doesn't mean anything, I haven't read the book that goes with this yet, but I'm IN LOVE with this CD!!!
B0010X73ZG|2.0|I like Frank Darabont. His ability to interpret Stephen King for the screen has always pleased me. The Mist unfortunately failed to impress. A  promising beginning and  gripping middle are sullied by an ending the Outer limits tv show would be embarrassed to put it's name too. Ok, ok people go to movies for different experiences. But I'm sure I can't be the only one who despises films that at the last moment attempt to trip you up, to throw you on you face and then laugh \\"ha what you going to do about it?\\"  If ever a film could of done with an alternative ending for the dvd release it's this one. I like to be rewarded for making the effort to watch a movie, I'm not saying I always want a happy ending, or a positive out come. I just don't want to leave the cinema feeling like I've been robbed of my humanity.  If you haven't seen the Mist I would urge you to rent it rather than own it. I don't think your going to want to watch this more than once.
0385338724|4.0|Okay, so this is not high art.    Nonetheless this story was cute chick lit that kept me interested.  You kind of saw the end coming about a mile away, but the author kept me glued to the pages by using excellent details of each of her characters and I must admit to being more than a little curious as to how the author would meld the past and the present into some kind of plausible scenario.    As I mentioned, the love scenes you could see coming - but the overall story was really fun.    I am always amazed at the fact that althoug I NOW DESPISE the Shopaholics series and cannot stand to read the Madeleine Wickham (also written by Kinsella) - I always really like her out of series books written under Kinsella.    Good purchase.
B0010358CG|5.0|Saw the 'love letter' review at Ain't It Cool News and decided to check it out myself.  A top-notch movie - this is what Beowulf should have been.    Was a bit bewildered when I heard John Woo was involved - but I see now that action works well with his style....haven't seen anything like this before.    Loved all the gorgeous details in HD presentation - I recommend getting Blu-Ray if you got the setup.  It's got so much details you find something new everytime you watch...sorta like 'eye crack'.    Good story though somewhat predictable at times, very engaging and emotional.  Music pretty good, good acting and decent extras...    Overall highly recommended
B00110K3BY|5.0|Cop some LSD. Sit down with your closest friends. Put this on and have the time of your lives! My friends and I used to make it an event! Don't forget to keep being responsible afterwards. Enjoy, life's too short.
0375847227|5.0|This trilogy is a fabulous work of fiction with incredibly complex themes about the universe, sin, and love. For all of those who disagree with the theology behind the book, you can nevertheless enjoy delving into creative descriptions of the inter workings of angels, souls, sin, and consciousness. I doubt that young readers could fully appreciate the theological allegories; in which case the book would appear to simply be about talking polar bears, witches, and faraway worlds.
B0012SVF3A|4.0|An Angel is sent to help one of the most useless persons on earth.  The angel walks with him through his miserable, underworld life and teaches him the things that really matter, truth, what beauty really is, and realization and acceptance of who he is instead of who he pretends to be.  Why would God send an angel to this worthless man?  The answer must be that no one is worthless in the eyes of God.
1416523359|1.0|I rented the CD to listen while on the road.  As a trucker I rent a lot of books and generally grab up any Stephen King reads because his books really help me chew up the miles on long hauls.      Like others have said...I too couldn't finish it.  In fact after renting it for around $12 (Unabridged) I turned it back in after only getting part way through disk 4 of about a 12 disk set.  I was both bored, and irritated with it.  I was bored because by disk 4 it seemed to still getting started.  When other King novels usually have me engrossed before the end of the first disk.  I was irritated because of the over kill in these cute little phrases.      If I had just heard the disks without knowing who wrote the story I would have guessed it was some cheesy romance novel and would have dropped it within ten minutes.  Since it was Stephen King I kept trudging on expecting a good story to formulate before very long, but it never did.  Some like romance novels, but when I pick up Stephen King I expect to be entertained.  This book up to disk 4 was just a rambling mush fest.  This has such a strong female flavor of romance to it that I can't help wonder if it wasn't Stephen King's wife who wrote it, and they slapped his name on it for marketing.
B00005JNJV|4.0|Being of a younger generation, I never saw any of the older Batman films. I think it was a good descision of Nolan's to start from the beginning...<br /><br />It's intriguing, this film, with plenty of good acting and casting. Liam Neeson is, as always, phenomonal. His voice alone is enough to make me shiver with fright.<br /><br />Christian Bale is also very good. While I cannot compare him with any of the previous Batmans, I'll go and guess that he couldn't have been much of a let down. He is a very good actor.<br /><br />Michael Caine positively ROCKS as Alfred.<br /><br />Something that appealed to me, opposing popular superhero films, is the fact the Bruce Wayne doesn't actually have super powers. Not only does this saves us from a corny \\"scientific\\" explanation (cosmic radiation, more than likely) for why he can do this or that, but it also helped me connect with the character more.<br /><br />It's a good start for what should be one heck of a series. I can't wait for the sequel.<br /><br />Favorite line: \\"He's driving a black...tank.\\"
1559942665|3.0|The author said it himself, \\"What does all this have to do with business? \\". I bought this book hoping to get an insight into how large companys are run. Unfortunately it was full of details on how companys are sold, not run. I suppose if that is what you are after, then the book does its job. But if you wanted to learn something about real business, this is NOT the book for you.
B00005JPXY|4.0|I was really blown away by this film. The concept of a hand-held camera filming the whole thing was well concieved and well executed. It really made the film come across on a more personal level, yet it wasn't excessive.<br /><br />The creatures were truly terrifying and realistic. I hope that the Academy will recognize this with some sort of SFX award come Oscar season.<br /><br />The acting was what really impressed me, though. Unlike normal movies where the cast pretends the camera isn't there, these actors recognized the camera, and came across as real people in that situation. Very impressive ensemble.<br /><br />I know a lot of people hated it, particularly the way it ended. At the risk of sounding very corny; I found that one way to appreciate it more is to look at it as a sort of love story. If you think of the main plot line as the Rob/Beth relationship, with the monster attack supporting it, it really is a very good movie.<br /><br />Four and a half stars.
6305882592|1.0|While we like quirky, funny movies, just could not get into this one.  It was just too odd and dated for us to enjoy.
B0010358CQ|5.0|usually when u watch a movie, u just kinda sit there and absorb it all in without moving around at all. i don't know about anyone else, but i could hardly sit still watching this. there is SO much to see and experience, i doubt anyone could take it all in one time through. the world is just absolutely stunning, and that is putting it lightly. the story is right along the lines of previous appleseed installments, it makes ya think, makes ya excited, makes ya sad, takes you on an emotional rollercoaster. the voice-actors did a superb job. not a dull moment in this one. highly highly recommend it!
0143143492|5.0|I found this book to be a life changing book. The first chapter was difficult to get through as it was more conceptual in nature. The next 9 chapters gave ideas and concepts that were very thought provoking. It is a book that really has to be read more than once. I would read a chapter and have to think about what I just read, and then move on to the next chapter. As things come up in my own life, I am reminded of what was in the book and can make small changes in my behavior and how I respond to what has gone on. Not an easy read but definitely well worth the time spent.
B000EDWKXI|4.0|I love Heath Ledger and I absolutely love him in this film.  For the first time, you get to see a funny, comical side of him.  The movie was shot entirely in Venice, and so the scenery and the architecture is beautiful.  The film is not a boring \\"trying to be a biography\\" of Casanova, but it is a light and funny story of his escapades based on his reputation. However, he winds up meeting the woman who challenges him, and ultimately falls in love.  It's fun, it's funny, Heath is beautiful, charming and philosophical.  The entire cast is  wonderful..Sienna Miller whom I had never actually seen in a film brings a unique character and fresh face to the screen.  Oliver Platt is absolutely hysterical!    See it, escape for a while-its all good fun without being a slapstick comedy that isn't funny.

B0012QTT6M|5.0|I am one to give a chance to an actor in an \\"out of the box\\" role.  The lead role of a meek chemistry teacher \\"Breaking Bad: into the world of illegal drugs is nothing less than perfect for Bryan Cranston.  He has years of comic experience which fans like me have seen, but his dead-pan comic skills readied me to watch him in a dramatic rold, as he seems incredibly real and genuine.  Who in this life has not wondered, what if I took this road - where would it take me?  His choices take him to unexpected places and decisions, but the core of his character, a caring loving father, passionate about chemistry never changes.  I am eagerly awaiting a second season.  Don't miss this if you are looking for something new, refreshing, with a flawless blend of humor, drama, violence, and compassion.
B00005MP58|3.0|I love this show. But, the DVD color ruined it. Even with the brightness all the way up, the people had black blobs on their heads instead of hair and the shadows were all pitch black and the bright colors were bluish.<br /><br />Oh and I bought the special edition, in 2008, and it said it had been remastered for the best quality in picture and sound. Well, they still have some work to do!<br /><br />I returned the DVD and got the tapes from Amazon marketplace. So beautiful and well worth it!! Get the tapes. There are 6 tapes and even with the hassles of the tapes I was as enchanted as I was when I first saw this on PBS and waited for a rerun!!
0670034711|5.0|Elizabeth Gilbert had me in her clutches within the first few pages of this book. She is witty; she is smart; she cares deeply; and she is honest. Not only that, she is a fine writer.<br /><br />After a painful and guilt ridden divorce and a passionately dysfunctional relationship, Gilbert determines that, in the next year of her life, she will follow her passions, one at a time. She calls her Italian stint \\"the Pursuit of Pleasure,\\" and much of that pleasure is learning the beautiful language of the poet and eating, much eating. Gelato for breakfast? Why not? While indulging herself after American disasters with men, she begins to rediscover her own true self.<br /><br />From Italy, she heads to an ashram for six weeks of meditation and spiritual cleansing. No more gelato for breakfast. Initially, she finds it difficult to keep to her path; however, her own tenacity (along with some new friendships) keeps her on track and moving deeper and deeper into her center. Some of her descriptions of her process and her distractions drew me into the ashram beside her. Sometimes I wanted to help her and sometimes I wanted to be her. Sometimes, I wanted to tell her, \\"Let go already!\\" The initial six weeks expanded into four months.<br /><br />Then, she reaches Indonesia, answering a vague invitation, several years old, from an elder healer in a small village. Gilbert has fed her body, she has fed her spirit, and it is time to balance by feeding her heart. The old healer does remember her, after some prompting, and she begins spending her afternoons with him. Bali is paradise.<br /><br />Every morning around sunrise there is a tropical birdsong competition, and it's always a ten-way tie for the championship. When the sun comes out the place quiets down and the butterflies get to work. The whole house is covered with vines; I feel like any day it will disappear into the foliage completely and I will disappear with it and become a jungle flower myself. The rent is less than what I used to pay in New York City for taxi fare every month.<br /><br />Best of all, Gilbert learns that she can trust herself and another enough to have a serious relationship.

1400095204|4.0|Set against the secession of Biafra from Nigeria, this story paints a subtley horrifying picture of how ordinary people were swept up in the senseless violence of the ensuing civil war. The set of central characters includes a wealthy family from the dominant tribal group in the area, a houseboy from a poor village family, an intellectual from the local university totally committed to \\"the cause\\", a British national who has a fascination for Igbo culture and a major in the Biafran army. The variety of perspectives on and experiences of the war this cast of characters represents gives us a rich picture of the way ordinary people were caught up in happenings beyond their control and how they reacted to their often desperate situations. Since all the characters are from the Biafran side of the struggle, however, we do not get to see the perspectives of those on the other side.    The narrative woven around the central characters is utterly compelling and the descriptions of violence and its effects are utterly horrifying but come in short bursts. The novel does not dwell on violence. If anything, it is understated, but the descriptions we get are the more powerful for that.    The author uses the clever device of having one of the central characters write a history of the war, interspersing snippets from this history through the story so the reader can come to understand some of the details of the historical background. If there is a criticism to be made of the novel, it is that these snippets of history fail to portray the greed and power lust of the major players in the political arena at the time, who sanctioned the suffering of thousands for their own ends. If you want to read a pithy, succinct history of the Biafran conflict, try the chapter `A House Divided' in Martin Meredith's \\"The State of Africa\\".
0618918248|3.0|I simply disagree with Dawkins' claim that an atheist who respects religious beliefs, \\"belief in belief\\" is a hypocrite, lying to him/herself or \\"bending backwards over religion\\". As a social liberalist (and as secular humanist) I find it difficult to accept that you cannot tolerate different lifestyles, world-views or beliefs. To apply the methods of natural sciences to social reality is pretty much using a hammer where you need a scalpel. In the current world, the conflicts all around are not so much about the existence of god, but mundane issues on tolerance, politics and everyday way(s) of life. There are reasons why fundamentalism is raising its ugly head just now both in Middle-East and States, and these reasons are not ultimately metaphysical ones...     There will probably always be religious people around and even if that would not be true, there will never be total consent over everything. Dawkins crusade against fundamentalist America is needed one, but I just feel that his bipolar attitude (scientific world-view versus religious world-view) is profoundly un-humanistic. Though I am a steady believer in the secular state, I also believe that respecting different lifestyles and religious cultures is the only way to live together in peace and understanding. You do not have to erase religion in order to get rid of fundamentalist and fanatic opinions. You can do it, but at what cost? To realize that there will always be different kinds of opinions is not, as he claims, cynical postmodernism. It is just plain fact.     Dawkins is eager to dismiss the contemporary humanistic field and he makes absolutely no reference to social sciences. His theory of memes pales in comparison to such fields' newest theories. I agree with him that it is better to base one's world-view on science than tradition, but it is also sad that he is not familiar with the contemporary methods and theories that really deal with the questions of human interaction, identities and meaning-making within sociocultural matrix. All in all, Dawkin's newest is a brave counter-attack on human stupidity (intelligent design, fundamentalist monomania, etc.). The bad thing is that when he rides to war he also polarizes the social field even more, symbolically leaving no middle ground to those Christians, Jews and Muslims (and yes, atheists) that really want to interact.    Dawkins really has very little to offer apart from the advice \\"be boldly Atheist\\". There are places on earth where we already are (and that, of course, should be a universal virtue of every society). But that alone does not yet solve the ultimate question: how to live together and yet have incompatible beliefs. Dawkins is all mind but no heart. In his scientific rationalism, he isn't really interested in practical ethics.
B000ASDFJU|2.0|Although I was initially impressed with the Sex and the City - The Complete Series on DVD, the slick format with the chapter information, and the compactness of the Giftset, I've since been disappointed by the quality of the product.     It has taken me some time to get through the DVDs, and as a result, I have only recently found two of the discs to be defective (one will not play specific episodes, the other simply stops repeatedly in a jumpy fashion and will not allow me to get to the end of the episode). Unfortunately, as a person working normal 9-5 hours, I was unable to watch all the discs early enough to discover the problem discs until the 30 day full-refund period had elapsed. With a full refund no longer possible, I would be cautious in future in purchasing Amazon items which include multiple DVDs, and would caution others against buying the Sex and the City Collector's Giftset for this reason.
B0010YSD7M|5.0|Please buy this DVD so they will make more SG-1 movies.  I would buy it again despite what I'm about to say.  The movie had its moments, and was visually stunning, but I couldn't get past the fact that they wrapped up 90 minutes of building story in less than 5 minutes, left major questions unanswered, and just got plain silly at the very end.  I miss this show very much, and honestly just about anything is better than nothing, so even though I was pretty disappointed overall this is the only place you'll hear me say it.

Sledge tells it like it was and holds nothing back. The descriptions of the blasted battlefields full of dead is something you won't forget. His descriptions of the fighting conditions will make you thankful for dry clothes, hot coffee and fresh socks every day after reading this. Should be required reading in schools today - an important gift from someone who lived in the horror of war.

0425098478|2.0|I must admit it took me a minute to remember this book, as I have read it several years ago. That gives me an advantage on judging the impact of this book. At the time I had given it 2.5 stars but now it will definitly be 2 stars.<br /><br />This review is hard to write as I don't like critisizing books. People put their heart and soul in it and it may work for a lot of people. However, I'm not one of them. At the time of reading I had no management experience at all, so it should have felt like a quick and easy way to learn something. I found other books a much better help, though.<br /><br />If you want a quick read and spend 4 dollars an hour on this book go ahead. I'd just rather spend more time and money on another one.
B000VECAEO|2.0|I realize that \\"Seinfeld\\" is loved, adored, indeed *worshipped* by millions of people.  But phuleeeeze, you've got to be kidding -- \\"Seinfeld\\" is so lightweight it's embarrassing.  All four of the major performers are one-trick ponies: extremely one-dimensional.      It's not that the show isn't somewhat amusing, it is.  But that's all it is, mildly amusing at best.      One thing \\"Seinfeld\\" *does* have going for it is that most sitcoms nowadays are far WORSE -- incredibly mean-spirited which \\"Seinfeld,\\" thankfully, isn't.  \\"Seinfeld\\" is, if nothing else, a sweet, civilized, humane show, and that's rare nowadays.      But that aside, the show is weaker than Johnny Fontaine's vocal chords.       The funniest thing about \\"Seinfeld\\" is the laugh track.  Notice when the laugh track kicks in.  The laugh track is activated for lines that are either barely funny or else not funny at all.  Then, when there is a legitimate laugh, the laugh track gives the impression that an enormously funny thing has happened; which is rarely the case.    Listen to how out of sync the laugh track is as compared with what a live audience would, in reality, laugh at.      In many markets, \\"Seinfeld\\" reruns are followed by reruns of \\"Everybody Loves Raymond,\\" and the difference between the two shows is remarkable.  \\"Everybody Loves Raymond\\" is light-years better than \\"Seinfeld.\\"  It's better written, better acted, better directed.  The characters are fully conceived, and the stories are human, empathetic -- as opposed to \\"Seinfeld's\\" typically smug, condescending, smart-alecky point of view.    So why is \\"Seinfeld\\" such a highly regarded sitcom?  Here are a few theories.     Theory #1: People like \\"Seinfeld\\" because they're attracted to the idea of a friendly, likeable guy living in a big impersonal city who, nevertheless, opens his door to all kinds of goofy people.  This is also my theory as to why \\"Friends\\" and \\"Cheers,\\" two other lightweights, are also so popular -- friendliness amidst theanomie of the big city.      All three shows are also heavy on \\"relationships\\" and \\"lifestyles,\\" especially relationships and lifestyles among singles.  And, God knows, people *do* need the maturity and intelligence of commercial teevee to clue them in on how to relate to people.  I imagine people see Elaine's \\"relationships\\" and say: \\"Yeah, I guess that's how it's done.  Better check with Oprah though.  Get a second opinion.\\"             Theory #2: Jerry Seinfeld is, in and out of character, an extremely likeable person, and on teevee that counts for a great deal.  As previously noted, one thing \\"Seinfeld\\" is *not* is mean-spirited; so the show scores points when compared to the harshly cynical junk that dominates teevee nowadays.  I don't watch \\"Seinfeld\\" reruns very much but when I do at least I know the show won't be cynical and mean-spirited, and that's an oasis in a desert of mean-spiritedness.           Theory #3: Jerry Seinfeld is evil incarnate.  Diabolical fiend that he is, he's hypnotized America into liking not just him but his facockta show.  (Oh, and they thought we'd never find out!  J'ACCUSE, JERRY SEINFELD!)    OK, let's consider each character, starting with Kramer/Michael Richards. ...     I mean, come on, fellow bipeds, how many times is it funny that Kramer enters a room skidding across the floor?  Without a rigged laugh track and a bigoted stand-up routine, Michael Richards would be working for the post office, and *Josh Mostel* would be sliding across the floor.  At least THAT would be funny!      Also, Mike baby, dig it -- Jerry Lewis did the spastic bit 50 years ago, and even then Jerry didn't drive it into the ground like you do.      Elaine/Julia Louis-Dreyfuss. ...     Pshaw and alas, very *very* limited.  Compare her to, say, Deborah/Patricia Heaton on \\"Everybody Loves Raymond.\\"  Patricia Heaton can *act* comedically.  She *moves* comedically.  In fact, her physical humor is as good as that of any female comedian whose appeared on television.  Moreover, she can deliver long, plot-enabling monologues as good as anybody in either comedy or drama.  In short, Patricia Heaton along with the rest of the cast of \\"Everybody Loves Raymond\\" can do all the things that nobody and I mean NOBODY on \\"Seinfeld\\" can do, least of all Julia Louis-Dreyfus-Head-Case.       Which brings us to Jason Alexander ...     His one-trick is that he whines.  Oy, can this boy whine!  This is some feency-schmancy whiner.  I want a million dollar whiner, this is who I go to.  I pray to God for a whiner: Jason Alexander falls from the sky into my lap.      Virtually every one George Costanza's laugh lines is Jason Alexander whining.  Whine, whine, whine.  Enough already!  Enough already, I'm getting naaaauseous!      There should be a character on \\"Seinfeld\\" whose sole job it is to *demand* that George Costanza stop whining.  In fact, if one of the characters in \\"Seinfeld\\" yelled at George Costanza, at the top of his lungs, \\"STOP WHINING!\\" -- there'd be a regular standing ovation three blocks long.    The writers on \\"Seinfeld\\" are intelligent in that they know how to write for their characters -- one-dimensionally.  Unlike, the writers on \\"Everybody Loves Raymond,\\" Seinfeld's writers don't give their performers anything very difficult to do comedically.  And the reason is simple: the performers on \\"Seinfeld\\" are limited, as both actors as well as sketch comedians.      The show had a very strict, very limited formula, which caught on with the public and, evidently, those associated with the show were content to work and prosper within those limitations.      One senses that the \\"Seinfeld\\" writers understood quite well the actors' limitations and, as such, \\"wrote-to-character\\" with their limitations firmly in mind.       Which, speaking of limitations, brings us to Jerry Seinfeld. ...     The people who conceived the show (one of whom no doubt was Jerry Seinfeld himself) were very smart not to make Jerry Seinfeld play a character.  Jerry Seinfeld plays Jerry Seinfeld and for a very good reason -- Jerry Seinfeld can *only* play Jerry Seinfeld.  In fact, even when Jerry Seinfeld plays Jerry Seinfeld, he isn't very good.  (Now THAT'S a limited actor!)      Jerry's whining is, more of less, one octave lower than Jason Alexander's whining.  And, ok, so one's fat and the other's skinny, but so's my Aunt Shirley and Uncle Bernie, and where's their sitcom?       The other thing that distinguishes \\"Seinfeld\\" as lightweight -- besides the rigged laugh track, the limited writing, and the low-grade talent -- is that a given show has a number of side-stories that invariably \\"slam-cut\\" across one another, the hoped-for-laugh being implicit in the juxtaposition of two story-threads suddenly coming together. ... Big deal.  Martin Scorcese watch out! ... This is as predictable as Kramer sliding into a room or George Costanza whining and kvetching, whining and kvetching.      The use of several story-threads in each episode means that scenes are often short, quick and non-sustaining.  Jerry is, for example, standing outside his door saying goodnight to his date, there's a few back-and-forth lines, and then BAM! the camera cuts to, say, Kramer running down the street tripping over himself, and then BAM! over to Elaine and George trying to unlock her, I don't know, her chastity belt.     All this suggests performers who can't otherwise sustain a \\"comedy spine\\" to a scene for more than a couple of minutes.  Notice, by contrast, how on \\"Everybody Loves Raymond,\\" a given scene is quite long, with often four or more actors in the scene.   \\"Seinfeld\\" a.) wouldn't dare film in front of a truly live audience, i.e., a live audience without a post production laugh track; and b.) keeps everything short and quick because short and quick creates a feeling of movement when the movement, the energy, should occur *within* the scene not against what comes before and after.    It's not that there wasn't an audience present when Seinfeld was filmed.  Perhaps there was.  And, no doubt, some of the bits got legitimate laughs from the audience on hand.  But it's quite obvious that in post-production a laugh track was inserted to \\"sweeten\\" the laughs.  Meaning: a live audience with a laugh track inserted later on is, in reality, *not* a live audience, given the final product, given what's presented as \\"the show.\\"      As the great Sid Caesar said about his \\"Show of Shows,\\" a laugh track was out the question because \\"that would be cheating.\\"      Jerry Seinfeld, a self-professed admirer of the classic comedians, must, in his heart of hearts, be profoundly baffled as to why his show is so successful.  I doubt very much if he would disagree with the above-offered analysis.      You've heard the expression \\"dumbed-down\\"? -- I think what \\"Seinfeld\\" has done is to \\"laugh-down\\" the comedy of the show, that is to say, they've purposely made the comedy so bland and so predictable, so obvious and so formulaic that the show is, in effect, \\"safely funny\\" -- cute, predictable, and (financially) guaranteed.     Kramer sliding.  ... George whining.  ... Jerry standing up straight.  ... Elaine trying to do God-knows-what, acting I suppose.  All this evidently pleases the people laughing on the laugh track, if not America's millions.      But what's lacking?      As much as Jerry Seinfeld, an admirer of great comedy, would like his show to be part of \\"The Great Comedy Tradition,\\" the truth is, the show falls way, way short of that lofty goal.     All great comedy speaks to the human condition.  The audience, at some level, must be moved; must be made to look at the world and their place in the world \\"with fresh eyes.\\"  The players have to be not just good comedians but also good actors.  They have to deliver not just cute, clever lines, they have to in some way move the audience \\"to look at themselves.\\"       For example, Alice Kramden gets mad at Ralph.  Her anger sets up the next joke, but her exasperation withRalph also speaks to the human condition.  Ralph, alas, is a dreamer, a dreamer who always winds up losing; but although a loser, his wife  stand by him, loves him despite everything: the crummy apartment, the cockeyed dreams, the predictable failures.  We are moved by their love.  Secretly, we long for such unfailing love.  This requires a display of emotions on the part of the performers.  This requires acting!  (To quote that famous American philosopher Jon Lovitt.)       Lou Costello makes us laugh, but he's also simpatico.  He is a fool in a world full of people far more clever than he is.  A fool in a world full of forces far too powerful, far too mysterious for one person to figure out, alone.  So he needs a partner, Abbott, to help him out.  The thing is, though, Abbott takes advantage of poor Lou as often as he helps him.  And so Costello is Everyman.  He is, perhaps, us, no?  This requires a display of emotions on Costello's part.  This requires damn good acting.     Laurel and Hardy keep pushing that piano up the hill.  It keeps falling back. yet they still keep pushing.  They still keep truckin'.  They still keep keepin' on.  Why?  Why do they remain faithful to the life-force?  Why do they endure?  Why don't they just give up?  It's funny, yes, what they're doing, the audience laughs, but while they're making us laugh, we're also thinking to ourselves, perhaps not in so many words: \\"This is The Myth of Sisyphus!  This is funny not just because these guys are doing funny things but because they're putting what they're doing within the context of the human condition, in this case the absurdity of life.  My God, the impossibility of it all! ... I dig it.\\"      There is longing in Stan Laurel's face and exasperation in Oliver Hardy's sighs, both of which transcend comedy.  In short, we're not just laughing; we are, on some level, enlightened.      Laurel and Hardy, Abbott and Costello, Charlie Chaplin, W.C. Fields -- all the great comedians are much more than merely clever: their futility, the utter hopelessness of their situation, moves the audience to think about something beyond the humor, beyond what's apparent.     \\"Seinfeld,\\" on the other hand, is completely devoid of emotions.  The material that's written for the performers doesn't require actors because it doesn't require emotions.  The \\"stuff\\" that's goes on in the show never rises above the merely clever; it's instead smart-alecky, \\"look-at-how-smug-I-am\\" ... nothingness.  Indeed, the creators of the show *brag* that the show is about nothing!  And, yes, that's exactly right, that's it in a nutshell: \\"Seinfeld\\" is empty humor.  And, with empty humor, we get empty humanity.      Indeed, \\"empty humor\\" is an oxymoron.  If so-called humor is empty of human emotions, empty of humanity, then it's not really humor.  A while ago I saw a PBS special on Jewish humor and towards the end of the program a scholarly fellow came on and made a point that I've never forgotten; that, for me, explains a great deal about life and human nature.  He said: \\"I don't know this for sure, but I have the feeling that the words 'humor' and 'humanity' have the same root because you can't have a sense of humor unless you have a sense of humanity; and vice-versa.\\" ... And that's what \\"Seinfeld,\\" along with a great many other modern-day attempts at humor, lacks: humanity.    Notice how in \\"The Honeymooners\\" or in \\"Everybody Loves Raymond\\" or in a Charlie Chaplin movie or in any classic comedy, notice how at a certain point a *seriousness* presents itself.  Often this seriousness takes the form of someone being hurt; for example, Deborah in \\"Everybody Loves Raymond\\" is offended by a remark her mother-in-law has made; The Little Tramp has been rejected by his love-interest because of his downtrodden condition -- so that amidst the humor of the piece, a misunderstanding of sorts has taken place, and, as a result, someone in the story, someone we can identify with, feels abandoned, alone, unappreciated.  The performers at that point have to act their way out of the predicament, dealing with a problem comedically that can just as easily become tragic.  (Imagine, for example, if Deborah really *had* a mother-in-law like the one on the show!   Violence might easily replace comedy as a resolution.)       \\"Seinfeld,\\" needless to say, is light-years away from that kind of enlightened comedy -- the kind of humor that speaks not simply to the clever or the glib but, more inportantly, speaks to \\"the human comedy,\\" the human condition.  But how many people in the arts today *are* concerned about the human condition?  Chaplin was, Sturges was, Capra was, Orson Welles was, Mark Twain was; with lesser talents taking their cues from these giants.  That, ironically, may be why \\"Seinfeld\\" is  so successful: it's either what the American public wants or else what it's been forced to endure -- as Ernest Hemingway put it: \\"nada y nada y pues nada.\\"       There is no emotion on \\"Seinfeld\\" -- no simpatico, no humanity -- because the creators of the show decided that that's how they wanted to pitch their show to the American public.  And, bingo! they succeeded.  Cleverness and nothingness are, after all, what television nowadays is all about, no?  \\"Seinfeld,\\" in that respect   -- smug, shallow, smart-alecky -- was a forerunner for the shows that came after that have even less quality and more shallowness; less talent and more smugness.      I can't believe that any of the \\"Seinfeld\\" performers look at the show in reruns and say to themselves: \\"Yeah, man, that was my best work!\\"  Or, \\"Damn, that's the best writing I've ever performed!\\"      Finally, and sadly, we must say something about Seinfeld after \\"Seinfeld.\\"  Poor Jerry.  Poor, poor, poor-poor-poor Jerry Seinfeld. The Wandering Comedian. ...     -- He produced and starred in a documentary, \\"Comedian,\\" in which he tells us how he created from-scratch, from Joke 1, a stand-up monologue.  (Yaaaaaaaaawn.)    -- He did a voiceover for a character in an animated bee movie.  *And* we're told by Jerry, his-own-self, in interview after interview after interview, that he did \\"exhaustive research\\" for the part.  (Jerry, leave the bees, take the cannoli.)       -- He went on David Letterman and stood up for his racist, anti-Semitic colleague Michael Richards.  (NOTE: a few months before he did his racist rant onstage, Michael Richards did an anti-Semitic number, too.)       And so one must ask: whither doth thou goeth now, Jerry Seinfeldeth?  What's your next move, boychick?  Let's face it, what can you do now, limited that your talent is?  What can you do now that people won't finally catch on that \\"Seinfeld\\" was a fluke?       When, oh when will you finally crack, Jerry Seinfeld?  When, no longer able to contain your guilt, will you go running naked through the streets of Beverly Hills screaming: \\"I AM UNCLEAN! I AM UNCLEAN!  TAKE BACK THE MONEY, I AM UNCLEAN!\\"    Such thoughts, no doubt, haunt Jerry Seinfeld.  I imagine he wakes up in the middle of the night in a cold sweat, muttering: \\"You mean, they actually paid me for all that cockin' around?  They actually PAID me?!\\"    His wife turns to him: \\"Jerry, please, not again.  Go back to sleep.  And stop whining one octave lower than Jason Alexander.  (Sheeesh!)  It was only a nightmare.  Not to worry, the money's still in the bank.\\"    Jerry (to his wife): \\"There's one born every minute, isn't there?\\"    \\"Yep, every minute.  And two to take 'im.\\"

B0010358CG|4.0|Appleseed Ex Machina is one of those good old school 80s style sci-fi animes with a lot of action, a lot of robots, guns and ridiculously acrobatic girls. The first movie was an acceptable (see: pretty and light) but standard anime, relying heavily on its look to distinguish itself. The cg in Ex Machina is far superior, the animation has improved quite a bit, and the storytelling is much more streamlined. Exposition is definitely there, just like the first, but the pacing is way superior. Sure, its got a lot of nonsense science, but any fan of anime in general will find something here. It's got stuff to appeal to girls and boys and in blu-ray it looks freakin' amazing. A great purchase, and a visual contender with heavyweights Beowulf and Final Fantasy TSW in the cg category.      Pros +  + More Briarios  + Improved English Voice Acting Dramatically  + Better Pacing  + Amazing Visual Quality and Sound    Cons -  - English dialogue sync has an iffy moment or two  - The story is particularly ridiculous  - The final sequence's location is very particularly ridiculous and reminds me of Xenosaga.  - People with an affinity for realism and diplomacy may find this irreverent.
B000PTYPAC|5.0|I bought Riot! about three weeks ago and have listened to it almost every day, if not every day!  My introduction to Paramore was by my eleven year old daughter on MTV.com.  CrushCrushCrush immediately caught my attention and I've been hooked on their songs since then.  The maturity and power of 19 year old Hayley's voice is staggering and the guys in the band play as performers much older and more seasoned than 17,20 and 22.      Emergency is the second song that snagged me and the video is done really well.  These four musical artists also look like their having alot of fun when performing live or just doing a video for TV.  I don't own 'All We Know Is Falling', but I plan to buy it soon mainly because of 'Emergency'.     Given the opportunity and with the right management Paramore should be around for many years to come.  Keep it up, guys(and gal)!
B000YDOOUK|2.0|When i first listen to their songs without knowing them i thought \\"hmm new AC/DC album with Dexter Holland on the vocals\\". If you want to listen to some 80's heavy metal melody then go for it. On the other hand why should you when you still have the chance to listen to the original AC/DC recordings.
B000HEVZ6W|5.0|I saw this movie when it first came out in theatres and have been extolling its virtues ever since.      As others note, it's beautifully shot, and in the context of its original release date is almost like an odd pornography for the age of AIDS (the plot requires excessive details on blood and other bodily fluids).    Most spectacular about the film though is its argument in support of those of us who were never supposed to do much, and somehow do and did much more.  I have watched this movie dozens if not hundreds of times now, and it still makes me cry.  It is a love letter to ambition, and a solace for those of us who have \\"never saved anything for the way back\\" and done extraordinary things in spite of flesh and circumstances.  In many ways, for me, this film is a litmus test for my close friends and other intimates.  While the film has its flaws and is not terribly accessible in its cold, heightened reality, getting it and being moved by it is a definite requirement for those in my life.
0374280967|2.0|One wonders into which genre this unlikely, thankfully brief, fictionalized account of a lifestyle changing experience in the life of the present day queen of England falls. After entering (alone) a mobile library book van to apologize for her barking dogs, Elizabeth the Second, by the Grace of God of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland decides to check out a book. With help from a patron who is also a kitchen staff member with a penchant for gay-themed and gay-authored books, she embarks on a literary odyssey, much to the dismay of her staffers. The queen's book worminess raises eyebrows as her favorite conversation starters go from expected small talk to book talk and she starts doing her duties (p 45) \\"with a perceived reluctance.\\" On the way, she learns what all true book lovers know (p 21) \\"...how one book led to another, doors kept opening wherever she turned and the days weren't long enough for all the reading she wanted to do.\\" Although one would think that most would believe being well read a good trait, her equerries are not of that mind, foiling her reading attempts whenever possible. The story's ending is even less likely than her solo visit to the bookmobile. The worst of The Uncommon Reader is its lame premise and stuffy writing (which, I suppose, gives it an air of authenticity). The best is the mention of many titles, and authors, a handful of insightful sentences like (p 30), \\"Books did not care who was reading them or whether one read them or not,\\" and (p 34) \\"A book is a device to ignite the imagination,\\" and a some choice vocabulary words including, \\"chivvied,\\" \\"scurf,\\" and \\"amanuensis.\\" Better: The Book Thief by Markus Zusak, Fahrenheit 451 by Ray Bradbury, Mr. Pip by Lloyd Jones, and The Incredible Book Eating Boy by Oliver Jeffers and Jim Broadbent.
B000U1ZV8K|5.0|Who can argue with 4 funny movies, the complete series, for the price?  As for those complaining about not having extras and special features... seriously, there is a reason its $10!  How about finding something else to complain about... I get movies to watch the movie, not for all of the fluff that comes with them.      If you like the Lethal Weapon series, here is your solution.
B0013FDM7E|4.0|This is the third film adaptation of Richard Matheson's \\"I Am Legend\\" novel.  The first was an Italian Sci-fi called The Last Man on Earth (1964), and second was The Omega Man (1971) with Charlton Heston.    I saw the Omega Man a couple years ago and enjoyed it.  Then when I heard there was a remake in the works I was excited to go see it.  Before going to see it in the theater I watched the Omega Man again but was not as impressed as the first time, I guess some movies just wear off after watching them once or twice.      Anyway, onto I Am Legend...  this movie was very exciting \\"edge of your seat feel\\" for a large part of the movie.  The movie started off with an amazing scene of New York City a few years after an apocalyptic event.  There were similar scenes in Omega Man but not nearly as detailed as these scenes.  The movie goes on to tell how one man works to cure a virus while living in a city of infected mutants.    I won't go into detail of the story since I don't want to give anything away, and you can always read other review that has a synopsis of the plot.  Some other treats are the excellent performance by Will Smith, the Bob Marley tunes that are played and the intense scenes involving Robert Neville (will Smith) and his dog vs the infected/mutant like people.     If you are interested in survivalist type sci-fi films then this is definitely a must see.  Also, if you like post-apocalyptic genre then you'll want to watch this film.
B00092ZMDY|5.0|At $100 or more for a ticket I have yet to see the Eagles on tour, but this DVD is about as good as it gets. A great show that I can put on as background music or just watch. The sound and video quality are just tremendous! If you're an Eagles fan, this is a must-have item.
B00133KFGW|5.0|Master TearJerker.  Ok, the story is more of a fairytale than real life, but this is the best of moviemaking.   Do you believe?  There is nothing in this film that I would call bad. This is the power of believing and following your dreams.  The cost of giving up, and the power of family and love.  You should like this movie but I warn that even the toughest of hearts may melt a little.  Enjoy.
B0015HS5TA|5.0|I LOVED this movie - can't wait to buy it.  It's my favorite film this year.  I laughed and cried.  Wonderful.  Amy Adams and Frances McDormand were perfect.
B0013D8LOU|5.0|I was a huge fan of the original stage version as well as the revival. I'd have to agree and say that this is most defiantly my favorite version. Johnny Depp is amazing. He really can sing and gives it plenty of gusto. Of course helena isn't the strongest and I agree i wish she would have given it a little more umpf but when i first saw it and heard her first song \\"worst pies in london\\" i was like why didn't she give that song more drive? then later as i thought about it it made more sense. she doesn't recognize sweeney at first, she's tired, times are hard she isn't supposed to be all chipper like angela lansbury's version. it fits better I think.       Final Say   Very Gory Very Good
B0011HOEY4|4.0|Interesting film, and a good expose of a modern crime boss. Denzel is very good as Frank Lucas, and his motivations are well explored. However, Russell Crowe has an amazingly complex role, and handles his material like a super-pro. This took place during the same time frame as Frank Serpico, and good cops had a really tough time. Ridley Scott did a fine job in bringing out the complexities of the narrative and the characters. Period detail, even though it was only in the 60's, was right-on, and it's always nice to see Ruby Dee, if even so briefly. Fine as she always is, I'm sure she won her awards because of who she is; she certainly wasn't challenged in this role (I liked her a lot in the TV version of \\"The Stand\\"). As a history lesson, this is worth a look. Production values are high, and the second DVD disc fills in a lot. Worth seeing...
B000MGUZKM|5.0|Great CD! The sample tracks are a great indication of the content. The music is a great collaboration between two artists! It is well worth the price!
006135323X|5.0|Rarely do a buy a book through spontaneity.  But I was in Target last week and noticed this book.  I picked it up and flipped through the pages.  The content seemed interesting.  From the beginning impression to the final impression, the book did not disappoint.  It was a great read about behavioral economics.  It highlighted studies of how peer pressure and slogans influence our decisions.  This style of economic thought differs from the classic economics because of the classic approach of assuming that all business transactions deal with rational people, but this discipline of thought realizes the wide variety of influences over our buying decisions.  The book is more than just a technical rendering of the material, it has fresh insights and helpful application.  If someone enjoyed Freakonomics, then this book is a must read.
0743201140|5.0|This was an eyeopener.  It helped me to realize what I have always felt:  Focus on your strengths - not your weaknesses.  It seems obvious, but all too often we spend time focusing on our weakness and trying to bring them up to our strengths.  Forget about it.  You are never going to be strong in an area that you are naturally weak.  You can get to a certain level of competency - enough to get by.  But, you cannot expect more than that.      Find your strengths.  Find a career that allows you to excel and become the best that you can.
B000R7HY0K|5.0|I thought that with the two \\"Kill Bill\\" films, Tarentino had lost his way as a filmmaker. \\"Death Proof,\\" for me, is his comeback film. It's an enduring, \\"Jackie Brown\\" quality piece, with a great feminist subtext (though if you watch only the first half of the film, you won't believe it.) The second half of \\"Death Proof\\" is Thelma and Louise for hypomanics. I found the film, for all its absurdity and horror, actually life affirming, and I've watched it now half a dozen times. It's that good.
0525950079|5.0|I remembered reading Pilars of the Earth more than 10 years ago and as a busy mom and professional, I have had little time for books lately. However, my memories made me so excited to read this book that I decided to not worry about the size. So glad I ignored that b/c this book surpassed my expectations. I love Follett's character development, and various perspective writing. I want more.  Thank you for this gift.
B000VBIEXS|1.0|I was a huge Emerson, Lake and Palmer fan before and after this album. I attended the concert for this album tour at the Long Beach Arena when the sound system was in quadraphonic (two speaker arrays in front and two speaker arrays in the back). I owned the vinyl version of Brain Salad Surgery and played the grooves out of it. This is important only because of what I am about to say, and that is, this album is one of the most ponderous, pretentious, boring, self-indulged albums I have ever heard.    I was looking forward to hearing the digital version of this and started with \\"Karn Evil 9: 1st Impression - Part 1\\". I didn't make it 4 minutes into the song. What I perceived in my youth to be good progressive rock turned out to be talented players playing together with no soul. The twists and turns I thought were so technical are nothing more than trite noise making. The only track that resembles a song is \\"Still...You Turn Me On\\".    If you like Keith Emerson, as I do, then I recommend getting \\"Five Bridges\\" or \\"The Thoughts of Emerlist Davjack\\" by The Nice or anything by Yes during this time (\\"The Yes Album\\", \\"Fragile\\", \\"Close to the Edge\\"). All of these albums are much more cohesive and musical. When I listen to the Yes albums, I am still blown away by the musicianship and the songs.    During the aforementioned concert, after Carl Palmer's drum solo, he stood up and said to everyone there \\"I am the greatest drummer in the world!\\". It is that kind of hubris that permeates this album.
B00005MKA1|5.0|First time I heard this record, i loved the first three songs, the rest were alright, and I hated the final two (excluding the bonus track \\"Smile Jamaica.\\") This album grows with more listening, and probably makes me happier than listening to any other album ever. It also is probably in my top three favorite Bob Marley albums, Survival is the best. One of the reasons it is not my favorite is the lack of political lyrics which I think characterizes Marley's most important music. Most of these songs are about love and relaxation. The very next album, \\"Survival\\" hit it hard with the strong lyrics and amazing music. The music on \\"Kaya,\\" is almost as good, and the happier songs make me feel good. It is also not devoid of political issues, the song, \\"Crisis,\\" is more somber, and contains some powerful political statements. Buy this album if you are a reggae fan, it is essential, and will always put you in a good mood.
B0011HOEY4|3.0|If you put a gun to my head, I would say, \\"no\\", I didn't genuinely like this movie.  The acting was pretty good, but I'm not a fan of either Denzel or Russel Crow.  That's not saying they are \\"bad\\" actors, I'm just \\"not a fan\\"!  I thought the movie became hokey during certain parts, like when Denzel walks out of the church when he finds out they're on to him, and \\"Amazing Grace\\" is being sung by the choir in the background.  Hollywood seems to overuse the beautiful hym in alot of films, and it's becoming corny, like, oh no something traumatic happened, cue \\"Amazing Grace\\".  Use something original to evoke emotion, instead of relying on the easy way out.  They also used \\"110th Street\\" in the film, which was used in Jackie Brown!  It's like whoa, it's too soon to use that cool song in a movie again.  Blatant.  My favourite parts of American gangster were the scenes with Ruby Dee.  (All 2 of them).  For them to nominate her for this role is bizarre.  Ruby Dee was so much better in \\"Jungle Fever\\".  Her character was similar to the one in this movie but it was much more dynamic in Jungle Fever.  Why didn't they nominate her for that role, huh????  Oh yeah, it's a Spike Lee movie, I forgot.  Ruby Dee also had a much better role in \\"The Stand\\".  She is just a fantastic actress. And that's the good part, now for more bad...  The end of the film seemed a bit rushed and just didn't end on a good note.  It sort of made the whole movie collapse on itself. This is good for a one time viewing, the story was interesting, but been done before in a lot of other films.
B00005MKA3|5.0|If you are starting your reggae collection, this is the first album you should buy. If you have Legend already this works out because the albums don't share any tracks (the main flaw in Legend). I'd rather listen to this than Legend any day. This album has great music that is true to the genre. The aspect that I think defines reggae music is the percussion style, it is amazing and emphasized on this album. The most important thing about Bob Marley's music, is the political lyrics suggesting change. The album handles some terrible issues, but suggests a very positive future if we are able to \\"Wake Up and Live.\\" This feel is evident in all songs, especially in \\"Africa Unite.\\" The beats in this album are heart-thumping, and make you feel absolutely amazing. It's a pity that Marley's most important music is not heard by everyone. I think this album is better and characterizes Marley's purpose for making music better than \\"Legend.\\" My favorite song on the album is \\"Ride Natty Ride,\\" just an overall powerful song, everything about it is great. The weakest song is \\"So Much Trouble in the World,\\" but I think it works well as an opener (not the way it was released initially). It's message is vague, but leads in to the rest of the album. The listener asks, \\"What Kind of Trouble,\\" then the rest of the album answers the question. It closes with \\"Wake Up and Live.\\" The message of this song is to do our share and to live without hate. The bass and the saxophone are also incredible in this song, I cannot imagine a better song order for this album, and I can't imagine any music being better than this, and i listen to a lot of music.
B000XUOIQ4|5.0|We had the old VHS version and had been waiting for Disney to release a DVD version.  Somehow we missed it so we were super glad that Amazon had a brand new copy for sale.  This has been a family favorite for years and we really missed owning a copy. We're very happy with our purchase.
B0000669JL|3.0|First of all, I do not own this CD, but I own almost every Bob Marley and the Wailers album, and have heard every song on this compilation. I'm also not a fan of compilation albums, because they do not give a good representation of the quality of the artist, it's just like listening to the radio. The songs chosen are all great songs, but where is Kaya, Concrete Jungle, or any song off Survival, which is his best album. If you are a new fan, I suggest to start off with one of his real albums, either Kaya, Natty Dread, Survival, or Exodus. Ultimately, looking at the track listing makes me disappointed that these are the only songs most people are hearing. If you start out with this, it makes less sense to purchase an album of which you already have a couple songs, this is a dead end album. I think if I had bought this album, I would have never bought all the other ones, which I never get tired of listening to.
0312379293|1.0|I have enjoyed several of Jeffrey Archer's previous books, most particularly Not a Penny More, Not a Penny Less, and Kane & Abel, and his book of short stories: A Quiver of Arrows. His latest book, A Prisoner of Birth, is a real disappointment. It is far fetched and full of unlikely coincidences. It is also badly written, with too many clichés. Don't waste your time or money on this rubbish.
B000ASDFJU|1.0|i don't understand why when you can see this show all the time on demand one would buy this set when there are absolutely no extra features on this set. it's overpriced and a rip off. the whole point is to get some extras.
B00005JN2Z|5.0|Lately, Tom Cruise has been getting on everyone's nerves, and it is easy to see why. He's been a little kooky for the past few years and it has been very annoying...however, I have to say that none of that has tarnished the fact that he is a fantastic actor, and this film is proof of that statement...well, this and \\"Magnolia\\" of course.<br /><br />I recently revisited \\"Collateral\\" over the weekend, and I have to say that Tom Cruise delivers what I think is an Oscar-worthy performance as a contract killer named Vincent, who gives a New York taxi driver - a superb Jamie Foxx - the ride of his life. You all know the plot by now, so there is no point getting into it here. All that you need to know is that the film boasts some excellent scenery, dialogue, and a pretty cool film score. Michael Mann is at the top of his game here. He manages to inject that \\"Miami Vice\\" feel into all of his work, and it just comes off as incredilbly awesome.<br /><br />The thing that I love about this film is that it doesn't succomb to the conventional \\"lets blow crap up\\" attitude of it's genre. It's an intelligent thriller with a considerable amount of character development, and of course, there are times where suspension of disbelief is required, but not to the point where you are rolling your eyes. I usually avoid action films like the plague, but this is the exception as it does more than offer you boom booms and bang bangs.<br /><br />SEE IT, if you have not already.
B000N3SRRC|5.0|Clutch would have been my Led Zeppelin back in the day, if I was closer to my parent's age. Yes, maybe that is a bold statement. I will come off as bragging here, so excuse me. However, I know rock and metal music. I'm a music dork. There is not a band of this style, to surface in \\"modern\\" times that has been this solid and versatile. They put forth some of the best honest rock music there is to offer. They have evolved from a metal/stoner rock style to a more blues based rock style with a dose of \\"funk\\". But along the way they have never lost the ability to jam. When I heard that Clutch made the shift towards a more \\"rock\\" style on Robot Hive/Exodus, I'll admit I was skeptical. I thought they might lose their identity. But my mind quickly changed when I heard that album. They never lost that groove and heaviness. Even though the music is different and perhaps more accessible, there is still a unique sound going on. The songwriting of Clutch is it's own animal. And Neil's voice is like no other. One thing I notice about Clutch's music: When you are into the groove of it, suddenly, the brilliant lyrical content blindsides you.     From Beale Street to Oblivion is just what I would expect from Clutch..Another batch of great songs. There is no masturbatory cock-rock crap. Its just pure. It is without a doubt one of the best rock albums I have ever heard. This album is (only) slightly better then Robot Hive/Exodus in my opinion, simply because I think it has a more infectious feel to it.   A new album by Clutch might not be held in high regards. Maybe it will never be recognized like a Zeppelin album..But, as far as I am concerned, Clutch is bridging that gap from from the past to present, and keeping the imaginative rock music alive. This is what From Beale Street to Obivion does. It bridges the gap and then continues on, carving a dusty dirt road...And setting another standard. Very few bands continue to release one great album after another consistently. This band isresponsible for one of my favorite albums of all time--The Clutch S/T. And they haven't let me down since.So, obviously I love this band, and I have many legitimate reasons to. The only negative remark I can think of is that once in a great while, Clutch might write a song that I don't like...at least not as much as  others.   To wrap this up, I would like to add that you are missing out if you don't see Clutch live. This is not a band you just want to hear through your stereo. Trust me. See when they are playing your town, get those tickets and get ready to rock.
B0001LJC2K|5.0|Absolution is one of my very favorite albums. Most of the songs I can listen to over and over without getting tired of them. I love the complex baseline, the seamless mix of rock and classical, and every song keeps me on the edge of my seat asking for more.     How many times in a day do I listen to a Muse song? Many. How many times in a month do I listen to a Radiohead song? Maybe 5. How many times do I skip a Radiohead song when it comes up in shuffle? Most. It bores me. How many times would I do that to a Muse song? Very few.     For those of you who say that Muse is a blatant rip-off of Radiohead, I don't really see it. The voice is very similar. The music is very different. I love Muse. I only kind of like Radiohead. Showbiz could be labeled as a Radiohead copy. But it is my least favorite of their albums. As time went on Muse has created a sound that is entirely their own. Radiohead is good. Muse is good. Stop comparing them. Can't you just enjoy the music and shut up about it? Beethoven sounds like Mozart if you hear a 5 second clip. They're both classical, they use similar instrumentation, etc. But then if you actually listen to them they are very different from each other. As is the same with Muse and Radiohead. This is a very good album. Just shut up and listen.
B0012FHGCW|2.0|I rented this movie hoping that my friends were right.  They were wrong.  Oh my god.  This moving was boring, ponderous, and navel gazing at it's finest.  I didn't care about anyone because some mighty gigantic paint brush strokes were used to create these people for the film adaptation of the book.  I'm going to get the book and give it a reading.  To hell with this dumb film.  And you know what?  It really demonstrates Sean Penn's approach to acting.  His acting is sooooo hammy and irritates me to no end.  I swear.  In that other pretentious and boring movie he was in, MYSTIC RIVER, ALL does is mush up his face and look constipated.  Sorry guys.  I do not like this dude.  Nothing's there!  I just want to scream at him, \\"Say SOMETHING interesting\\"!!!  Yawn.<br />Oh, and one more thing...I do not romantize hermits.  They are nothing more than a reflection of THEMSELVES.  I don't need them going off and abandoning this society to tell me there's a lot wrong with it.  I already know that.  Now.  What do we do about it?  Now.  THAT'S interesting to me.
B000MRAAJM|5.0|I had seen this show on the Discovery Channel when it debuted last year and I was impressed and amazed by the excellent photography that was captured by the producers of this film. This is a must have in anyone's Blu-ray collection. It showcases the beauty of 1080p televisions and the beauty of planet earth itself.<br /><br />You will be amazed by Nature and what so few have ever seen as this documentary showcases some of nature's finest and unusual animals.<br /><br />The only difference between this version and the one broadcast on the Discover Channel is that Sir David Attenborough is the narrator and not Sigourney Weaver. You won't regret this purchase.
B000UNYK3A|5.0|overall, i feel like it has a pretty standard formula. the first half of the film is spent getting to know the characters. many party scenes scattered about with lots of gratuitous nudity. about 45 minutes in, the real \\"meat\\" of the film kicks in. i dont want to spoil too much in the overall story. there are very sinister things at work here, and you get bits and pieces of that throughout the movie.<br /><br />basically its the story of three backpackers, and a trip they'll wish they would have never taken, if they can survive till the credits..<br /><br />to most, this is no more than an exploitation film, but theres a lot more to it than that. its a film about exploitation. you see the main characters not only exploiting women throughout the first half of the film, but an entire nation, if not an entire continent. you see them exploiting the womens' bodies, laws of amsterdam, and the simple fact that they're americans. as time goes on, they become the exploited. they are now the exploited. imagination is the only limit on what can be done to them. for a price. [ironic.. although nothing can justify what happens to them]<br /><br />the social commentary can probably be noticed by anyone other than a five year old. in our internet ruled, ebay enriched society, nearly anything we want can be obtained for a price. the movie also plays on many americans feelings of foreigners and vice versa.<br /><br />theres a lot here past all the gore and nudity most people wont be able to realize, and thats fine. first, the camera work. in the opening scenes theres a lot of ambient camera runs with bright colors. as time goes on the color fads and the camera work has a much more frantic feel, perfectly complimenting the events onscreen.<br /><br />Eli Roth hired an orchestra to perform a lot of the music for the film. there is a simple tri-note riff with a deliciously sinister vibe you hear it throughout the film on different instruments from time to time. a very epic score overall. i especially like the work in the later sequences-intense.<br /><br />the voilence is extremely graphic, featuring some the most realistic and disturbing torture sequences you'll probably ever see.<br /><br />for the faint of heart- do not watch this. you've been warned.<br /><br />opening night-2 ambulances at the site. one woman left early and ended up passing out and falling on the ground. another woman thought she was having a heart attack and called 911. she wasnt really, but still. thats one crazy opening. this isnt for everyone.<br /><br />this is a horror film in the truest form of the word. its disturbing and horrific. it will stay with you for days-if not weeks-after seeing it. anyone with a strong stomach and even a remote interest in horror should deffinitely check this out.<br /><br />there's loads of great special features in this 2 disk director's cut. multiple commentaries, deleted scenes, alternate ending, 4 featurettes, interview with Takasha Miike, and more.r sequences-intense.    the voilence is extremely graphic, featuring some the most realistic and disturbing torture sequences you'll probably ever see.    for the faint of heart- do not watch this. you've been warned.    opening night-2 ambulances at the site. one woman left early and ended up passing out and falling on the ground. another woman thought she was having a heart attack and called 911. she wasnt really, but still. thats one crazy opening. this isnt for everyone.    this is a horror film in the truest form of the word. its disturbing and horrific. it will stay with you for days-if not weeks-after seeing it. anyone with a strong stomach and even a remote interest in horror should deffinitely check this out.    there's loads of great special features in this 2 disk director's cut. multiple commentaries, deleted scenes, alternate ending, 4 featurettes, interview with Takasha Miike, and more.
0793518326|3.0|Who gives this Five Stars your nuts! Yes, it is very accurate and helpful. You do need a magnifying glass if you were really there in 1963 like I was. Now if you are under 25 and just discovering the Fab Four you can probably read it ok. I am taking this thing apart and I am going to Kinko's and make my own large print edition. I'm going to do it a little bit at a time each week. The publisher really screwed up with the format or did they? I still paid about $70.00 when it first came out so I guess they didn't screw up. I would of gladly paid $100.00 for larger print and pages you can actually lay flat.
B000ZLFALI|5.0|I reallyloved the film. It was entertaining and it makes you want to sing along with the characters. I would definitly recommend to anyone who is a beatles fan.
B000Y8GFY8|5.0|With 'Seventh Tree' Goldfrapp have made a follow up to Felt Mountain while evolving and enhancing that mood. As much as I love songs such as 'Human', 'Pilots' and 'Lovely Head' this collection, as a whole, is superior, especially coming on the heels of their previous release. While it may be mellower in direction, there isn't one bad track here.<br /><br />To leave behind the hedonistic delights of 'Supernature' and dip back into the slower, quieter music found here speaks of true creativity driven by integrity rather than by consumer whims or market demands.<br /><br />Alison Goldfrapp has an incredible, beautiful voice and on this record the music is stripped back to showcase that voice to great effect with songs that give her space for more delicate expression and, lyrically, to explore more simple, earthy subjects.<br /><br />I agree with other reviewers on their choices of favorite tracks but have to add 'Eat Yourself' (which reminded me of the 'O Brother Where Art Thou' soundtrack) and the last track, 'Monster Love', which has the best vocals of the whole record. Goldfrapp and co-producer Flood have put them at the front of the mix and built everything else around, complementing them perfectly.<br /><br />The beats and drive of 'Supernature' are very seductive but if you can change gear, this record is no less seductive. The real power in the music of Goldfrapp, (with all deference to Will Gregory's talent) is Alison Goldfrapp, and she's still very much at the top of her game.<br /><br />(For those searching for something similar to 'Supernature', you may enjoy Roisin Murphy's last release, 'Overpowered'.)
B000B8I8X2|4.0|I like how a record company got together all its bands and tried to make one cd. It should be one of the greatest metal compilations of all time. Yes and no. There is some excellent songs within this set but some songs are bad. I give it four stars anyways.
B00005JMYI|2.0|It does give you the idea, that network news picks the best & leaves the chimps to do local news & cover irrelevant & banal features. The gags are geared to a six-year old. Too obvious for an adult. It reminds me of Late Night with David Letterman. He has a brain-fart & it falls falt. He thinks it will become funny if he repeats it three or four times, then explains the joke. No. Only his fool, Paul Schaefer laughs. Anchorman gives you escapist fare & you'll find yourself predicting what will happen next. Will Farrell sharpened his acting skills since then, but not much. The gang fight with all the local news teams is the funniest scene. That's about it.
1932100385|5.0|That is not such an easy thing to do. In fact, it may be nearly impossible for some. Most of us are brought up, by people who care about us, having been told to \\"finish your meat\\" and \\"drink your milk\\" or else we'll be sick. It's human nature to want to believe that what we've been doing is the best thing. So when we are told that it isn't, we can either consider that we may have been wrong all along, which is unsettling, or we can attack the message.    If I say that I feel better, with fewer aches and pains since eliminating animal products, that's subjective. But if I say my cholesterol level has gone from 189 to 157 with virtually the same amount of exercise, in a matter of just a few months, that's objective. Or when we learn about Dr. John McDougall, for example, who has reduced or actually eliminated his patients need for prescription drugs for ailments such as diabetes, high blood pressure, and even multiple sclerosis and many other illnesses through diet alone, shouldn't we at least take a closer look at this?    One of the most interesting parts of the book is the section `why haven't you heard this before?' The author explains \\"There are powerful, influential and enormously wealthy industries that stand to lose a vast amount of money if Americans start shifting to a plant based diet. Their financial health depends on controlling what the public knows about nutrition and health\\" pg 249. And \\"Personal bias is stronger than you may think. I know scientists with family members who died from cancer and it angers them to entertain the possibility that personal choices, like diet, could have played a role in the death of their loved ones. Likewise, there are scientists for whom the high fat, high animal-based diet they eat every day is simply what they learned was healthy at a young age; they love the habit, and they don't want to change\\" pg 266.    But that's an important part of being human, the ability act not just on instinct, but to carefully consider the consequences of our actions, and then make the optimal choice - even if that means changing.
B00005M91K|5.0|The pace of nature, life and human actions is beautifully illustrated in a succession of splendid scenes. One matures with this movie.<br /><br />Note how people around the world are so different and at the same time so equal !<br /><br />Well done!
0061015725|2.0|Like other reviewers, I think his vision of an army of rapidly evolving nano-robots is unique and rather frightening if it came to pass.  The book starts out strong and draws in the reader.  However, much of the book's buildup read like the Andromeda Strain and the conclusions at the end were over the top and ultimately not believable.
B00026WU7I|5.0|\\"Blood on the Tracks\\" is Bob Dylan's best album. Those who think of him as a protest singer from the 1960s or a wizened old has-been who can't sing should listen to this. There is a subtlety and intelligence here that leaves one grasping for superlatives - witness the second song on the album \\"Simple Twist of Fate\\" - his attention to the lyrics of the song in both music and performance would impress any classical music composer. \\"Idiot Wind\\" is one of those Dylan songs that, in both its scale and sophistication, shows how he towers over his contemporary composers. There is cynicism and tinge of pain in this album, which mark it as one of the great confessional albums yet ironically, like all great music, it is life-enhancing. A timeless masterwork from this great American genius.

B0010YSD7M|4.0|I am a huge fan of Stargate SG-1, and own all 10 seasons on DVD.  I greatly appreciate that the Ori storyline was wrapped up in this movie, since there were a lot of dangling threads at the end of season 10.      Among the things I enjoyed:  - all of the actors did a great job, as usual, and there was excellent continuity with the series mythology (case in point, the Asgard core that was obtained in the final aired episode)  - excellent production values, especially entering the Supergate and Adria's flaming powers (though the series always did a great job of making every dollar count in special effects)  - the very best lines given to Christopher Judge in 10 years as Teal'c and Tomin discussed guilt and redemption  - the moving scene where Daniel breaks down, at the limit of his faith and endurance    Things I did not enjoy so much:  - the one-dimensional IOA bad guy  - some very big scene jumps that had me confused for a while (ie, after entering the Supergate, suddenly Vala, Daniel and Tomin are undercover on an Ori world meeting with the underground)  - bringing the replicators back was repetitive, and isolated Carter and Mitchell from the Ori saga  - the replicator-zombie was just gross, and not particulary original    After listening to the writer/producer/director's commentary, I wish he had spent less attention on production values and more on increasing the emotional resonance of the story.  The fact is, most fans have followed SG-1 so loyally because they love the characters, and would like to see their reactions and interactions with each other.  This story felt detached somehow -- I have felt much more invested in the characters in some of the season finales than in this movie, and the season finales were never short of action, so I was suprised that the writing didn't seem up to the same standard.  Without that emotional connection, the battle and even the victory seemed a bit hollow to me.    That said, it was wonderful to revisit with my favourite TVshow again, and I hope they make more DVD movies!
B0012NVGHU|5.0|A beautiful story of the power of persistence and following your dream.    This is not \\"Irish\\" music.  I don't know where that reviewer was coming from with that. It's beautiful folk music made by two young talented artists.  I'm glad they won the Oscar for \\"Best Original Song\\"!
B00005JPTK|1.0|Sighhhhhhh.  Here we go again.<br /><br />Superb, classic source material once more bastardized, replaced with typical Star-Vehicle lameness by the hacks of Hollyweird.<br /><br />Will Smith's Neville is ok, but could have been truly memorable had the story some real juice.<br />New York City looks terrific - except...so, where's all the signs of terrible chaos, and all those (non PG-13) corpses that should still be littering the place!?<br /><br />Instead of offering us a nicely thought out story where the (genius) Neville supplied himself with intelligent options and a backup plan to escape to secondary hideouts (imagine a highrise where he could have fended off stairwells full of attackers ) - thus prolonging the suspense and action - we are given...Shrek from a basketcase.<br />Instead of exciting scenes in which the superb survivor and rationalist Neville investigates what would have been portentous signs that the infecteds were becoming increasingly aware and manipulative (the mannequins!) - and thereby stuggles to more quickly obliterate their lairs - we are offered...an utterly lame and unbelievable night rescue.<br /><br />Opportunity after opportunity cluelessly squandered, lost, thrown away.<br />End result: I Am Languid.<br /><br />On second thought, Grandmaster Matheson, forgive them not!
B000UYX5AI|2.0|...I have been a huge biffy clyro fan for a while...Infinity Land is one of my favorite albums being both experimental and never at a point where I could wrap one genre around it...it took a while for a new album to come out (especially after the tragic death of the lead singer's mother) but there really is no excuse for this...    ...the first track \\"Living is a problem because everyone dies\\" is a very good song with the use of violins and children's singing (in a ghostly way) to create an amazingly good song...unfortunately that's where the downhill slope becomes literally vertical...    ...songs like \\"Who's got a match\\" and \\"Folding stars\\" are poppy even for Biffy's standards...I could cope with \\"Questions and Answers\\" and \\"My Recovery Injection\\" because the rest of the album made up for it and they weren't that awful...they're probably in the same category as \\"Saturday Superhouse\\" on this album...    ...what bothers me even more is they are getting huge praise and even radio play from daytime radio which is pretty much saying to them like a tellytubby \\"again again again!!\\"...    ...ok to conclude this album is nothing compared to their older albums and if you honestly believe that it is then I guess you are a better Biffy fan then me...download the one good song and hope that they will go back to their old ways...or something new and fresh...just evolve into something interesting...so until that happens this will be my last Mon the Biff...

He finds out that there is another opportunity, and that is for a bobsled team, something Jamaica has never attempted because... who would ever dream of a team from a Caribbean Island that competes against the best of the best... they don't even know about snow!!!    John Candy is a retired Olympic gold medal winner and he lives in Kingston. The team enlists his services and soon we find ourselves witnessing a rather funny story of a group of athletes going to compete in Calgary, Alberta, Canada, where cold is something beyond every conceivable idea of this group of four great athletes.    Simply, don't' miss this fun Caribbean story of the struggle to achieve greatness.

B000L43AN4|4.0|The old version of Tom Waits, with the jazzy backdrop, lush orchestrations and tales of down-and-out losers and hookers in the dark bowels of the barroom night, seems assuredly gone forever at this point. One can relive those days vicariously through the artist's catalogue for Elektra/Asylum (plus the soundtrack to Francis Ford Coppola's ONE FROM THE HEART), but Waits has rigorously steered away from that previous incarnation since then, recording some of the most willfully idiosynchratic music since Captain Beefheart hung up his skates, as well as some of the most heartfelt songs--you know, with verses and choruses--anyone's ever written. ORPHANS has a lot of both, being a compilation of songs leftover from the sessions for his albums, contributions to tribute albums and soundtracks, fully-realized Waits versions of songs he's written for other artists, and a bunch of brand-new music in the bargain as well. Waits has helpfully sequenced this collection into a CD of loud 'n raucous stuff (\\"Brawlers\\"), a CD of ballads (\\"Bawlers\\") and a CD of completely unclassifiable material(\\"B**tards), and a lot of it is great. The things that aren't you can skip over effortlessly, because there are enough gems to choose from on each disc, and, in a strange way, the collection serves as a good distillation of how Waits has morphed as an artist from 1983's SWORDFISHTROMBONES onwards. Even if you can't listen to the whole thing in one sitting (at least I can't), ORPHANS is as rewarding as any of Tom Waits' regular-issue albums, postcards from somewhere over the edge....or maybe just around the block. Real good.
B000002KBU|5.0|I've got quite a few Joni Mitchell CDs in my collection now - every one of them treasured - but I've only just gotten round to buying this one, even though I've known for some time that it's considered far and wide to be one of her best albums (if not her best album ever).<br /><br />Well, I'm already in love with it. What struck me the most about the album, after just a few listens, is how intimate it sounds. For the most part it is just Mitchell singing along to guitar (sometimes performed by James Taylor, sometimes Steven Stills) with some percussion by Russ Kunkel on some songs, and to piano (presumably performed by Mitchell herself) on others. I so got into the intimacy of the music that when some songs (like \\"Carey\\") that introduced backing vocals, and others (like \\"California\\" and \\"This Flight Tonight\\") that introduced Pedal Steel came along, I almost found the extras intrusive. (I got over it eventually, of course).<br /><br />It's probably totally ridiculous but it was almost as if I felt she was singing just to me, FOR me, in a space that was occupied by just the two of us. I loved how that felt and still feels, every time I play the disc. Her singing style is amazing and amazingly unique. She sounds as free as a bird, going high and going low seemingly at will and seemingly without effort. I imagine her songs would be very difficult to cover, so much respect to the singers who performed on the Herbie Hancock CD I reviewed prior to this one. She sings of simple things yet her lyricism is as rich as a fruitcake. She's simply sublime.<br /><br />The only other thing I'd like to add is this: if people are still buying and talking about your album 37 years after it was first released, you ought to know you've done something right. If it's a non-jazz album then as far as I'm concerned, you've accomplished something phenomenal. This album is phenomenal. Every home should have one.
B000QUCNOK|4.0|Wow I loved this movie. But what does that mean to you? Well, If you enjoy mystery/suspense/horror type cinema with over the top endings you will love this one. The sets, colors , acting, music all were fantastic. If you like down to earth by the numbers movies forget it. A great movie.
B000M341QE|5.0|This was definitely one of the most gripping and well-crafted cop/crime thrillers I've seen in years---easily on par with the now-classic \\"The Usual Suspects\\" though quite a bit darker in tone.  Certainly one of Scorsese's best films in a long time, though a lot of the soundtrack seems very, very familiar if you've ever watched \\"Goodfellas.\\"<br /><br />Sidenote: why in God's name they chose a terrible, awful remake of the Pink Floyd classic \\"Comfortably Numb\\" instead of simply using the studio original eludes me.  This remake features Van Morrison (argh! this is just NOT his natural style or genre) and Roger Waters (who doesn't sound much like himself at all) and just sounds totally cheesy and weak.<br /><br />Other than that, my only other quibbles about this film are with a couple of rather implausible plot twists during the final 10 minutes, and a somewhat Tarantino-esque (think \\"Reservoir Dogs\\") ending.<br /><br />All very minor quibbles, indeed.  The script, by William Monahan, is flat-out perfect, as are all of the ensemble cast's performances, and when combined with Scorsese's trademark brisk pacing and snappy transitions, makes for a film which had me totally absorbed from the opening credits.  Stark contrast to how most films have a clearly defined \\"setup\\" first third which is kind of slow, then builds into a big second act where the conflict is played out, and slows again into a short third act plot resolution.  \\"The Departed\\" is just a hyperkinetic, grab-you-by-the-a$$ movie from the get-go all the way to the closing credits.<br /><br />A big part of its genius, and the reason it's a movie that you can watch over and over again, is that the characters are quite rich and mostly opaque, rather than being easily identifiable, focus-grouped stereotypes as in most mainstream Hollywood films these days.  Also, the dialogue is just stunningly well-written.  There's a lot of detail that you notice with repeated viewings, a lot of things that seemed a bit blurry or uncertain slowly become clearer.  The plot is quite intricate and best of all, totally unpredictable---refreshingly, I had no idea what was going to happen down to the very last frame.<br /><br />Another brilliant feature of this movie is that it has a very morally ambiguous subtext or perspective: there really are no clear good or bad guys, no knights in shining armor or innocent angels.  Every major character retains an extremely engaging element of darkness, shadow, and surprise and unknowability.  The cops and Feds and gangsters are all equally and comically, profane and violent...they're just on opposite teams, or most of them at least.  Even the Vera Farmiga character (this actress is a strangely dazzling and exquisite woman as well as a top-notch actress), has her own darkness.  What a delight, to enter a world of deeply imperfect and more or less impenetrable human beings, rather than good guys on white horses and bad guys in black hats...gasp! Why, I'll be damned, it-it-it's just like...REAL LIFE!!!<br /><br />In short, this film is definitely a keeper, most definitely worth owning.  One of the shortest 2 and 1/2 hours I've spent in a very long time...e clearer.

B000ZN802W|4.0|Sean Penn offers a beautiful, though overly long and at times plodding adaptation of John Krakauer's best seller.  The story chronicles the westward odyssey of Chris McCandless, an over privileged suburban kid who is determined to live out a peripatetic bohemian existence and to somehow \\"find himself\\" in the rigors of nature.  The cinematography is beautiful.      A series of vignettes offers mini-stories within the movie.  Chris as a farm hand. Living with vagabond hippies. Befriending an elderly widower who makes leather crafts.  (Hal Holbrooke is stunningly good in his role and, in my view, steals the movie.)      What all of these encounters share in common is a pattern of McCandless engaging with other people but eventually stopping short of commitment, pulling away and forging on toward his Alaskan sojourn.      A latter-day Thoreau and literary hermit, he meets his demise in an abandoned and isolated school bus in the backcountry wilderness. Perhaps McCandless should have spent more time burnishing his survival skills, training at NOLS or Outward Bound and spending less time reading \\"Dr. Zhivago.\\"    The movie offers interesting food for thought on how life's meaning is attained:  * Through books and learning  * Through conventional bourgeois pursuit of career, marriage and 2.5 children  * Through testing one's limits against nature in an isolated setting  * Through human connections and relationships    McCandless is fixated on the \\"test manhood through nature\\" approach.  He dies an isolated, painful death, leaving a wake of heartbroken people behind him, not the least of which was his family, with whom he abruptly cut off communications.  In the end, Alexander Supertramp dies searching for the Truth.      Did he find it?  Who knows.  The movie's closing only hints of this.  The candle that burns twice as bright lasts half as long.

A very fun read that had me laughing out loud and looking forward to reading...
B0010YSD7M|5.0|Wow,  Just saw the movie today on my big screen.  Audio and Video were great.  I liked the story line and got to see all the characters back in familiar roles.  Liked the extended 2 hour format and I am hoping if the sales go well, then maybe the movies will continue.  Also, the bonus features on the disk were great as well.  From the making of the movie, to the comic con interviews in San Diego CA.  I agree with Ben Browder, that one fan can't carry a tune in a bucket.  Very entertaining overall and worth the money for me

1577314808|5.0|The Power of Now by Eckhart Tolle is a spiritual classic, bestseller and translated into over 30 languages. It was awarded a member of Oprah's Book Club. Eckhart's newer book, A New Earth, is presently the newest addition to the Oprah Book Club. Oprah and Eckhart are currently offering a ten week online class that is accessible for free registration at Oprah's website. The first class was enjoyed by 700,000 people worldwide, from 139 countries and represented by all fifty states in the U.S.<br /><br />Eckhart was born in Germany and graduated from the University of London. He became a research scholar and supervisor at Cambridge University. At 29 years old, he experienced a profound spiritual transformation that dissolved his identity as he had previously known it. This began an intense inward journey that radically changed the course of his life. He now teaches worldwide and lives in Vancouver, BC.<br /><br />He is not aligned with any particular religion and yet his message does not exclude any doctrine or dogma. He is communicating that there is a simple and pragmatic way out of suffering into enduring peace.<br /><br />Power of Now is a guide to breaking free of the ego, the mind-made self, with all of its problems and conflicts. Eckhart finely dissects the ego's characteristics so that we become more conscious of how it operates. Who we are is beyond thought, emotion and form. Yet our body is the portal through which we enter a new reality to realize harmony, peace and joy. He encourages us to become more aware of the silence and space all around us and then points to inner space and stillness. Through becoming more conscious, we find that we can be free of psychological pain and open to our authentic power.<br /><br />Power of Now is divided into 10 chapters with 191 pages. The Preface is written by Marc Allen, New World Library and the Foreword is by Russell Dicarlo, author of Towards a New World View.<br /><br />In the Introduction, Eckhart shares the origin of the book and that the truth of who we really are lies within us. Chapter One is a study of the mind; the greatest obstacle to enlightenment. Through still attention, we can discover that we are not what we are thinking. He defines enlightenment as rising above thought and that emotion is the body's reaction to our thinking.<br /><br />Chapter Two begins leading us out of psychological pain by pointing to consciousness. He offers keys to unlock accumulated pain of the past and introduces us to the collective pain body that is suffering and constantly trying to feed on more pain. Since the mind-made self believes that its identity lies within its individuality, it is on constant search to complete itself through people, things and circumstances. He shares that ego's entire search for happiness is really a search for wholeness.<br /><br />In Chapter Three, we move deeply into the Now, the dimension that is free of time and demonstrates that nothing truly exists outside this present moment. He offers the key to the spiritual dimension and how to access the Power of Now. All suffering has its root in psychological time. Eckhart masterfully guides us in a clear and pragmatic manner into the joy of being.<br /><br />Chapter Four offers the mind strategies for avoiding the now and that it is delusion to think that we can ever be apart from it. He discusses the manner in which we dissolve unhappiness and ordinary unconsciousness to discover the inner purpose of our life's journey. In Chapter Five, he leads us to the state of presence and to realize pure consciousness; our divine Reality.<br /><br />Chapter Six is a journey into the inner body, where we find an invisible and indestructible reality that is beyond our thinking. He shares how we can also physiological benefit by being present; such as slowing the aging process and strenthening the immume system.<br /><br />In Chapter Seven, Eckhart offers portals through which we may discover the inner unmanifest that is deep within our bodies such as dreamless sleep, silence, and space.<br /><br />Eckhart Tolle shifts to Enlightened Relationships in Chapter Eight and we begin to arise about relationships that cycle between relative love and hate. Our relationships and indeed our intimate partners are excellent teachers and a perfect spiritual practice to learn how to live in a deeper state of presence. He encourages you to give up the relationship with yourself, the false sense of self that is the ego.<br /><br />In Chapter Nine, we discover that beyond the duality and cycling between happiness and unhappiness, there is peace. We notice the impermanence of the cycling, end the emotional drama, discover true compassion and move toward a new order of Reality.<br /><br />The final Chapter Ten presents the meaning of surrender so that we are able to live in acceptance of this moment just as it is. We shift from mind energy to spiritual energy, while we transform suffering into peace.<br /><br />Katie Davis, Author, \\"Awake Joy\\"ned Relationships in Chapter Eight and we begin to arise about relationships that cycle between relative love and hate.

1590171993|5.0|Ever wonder why the most eccentric teachers were precisely the ones who inspired you the most?    I have to admit that when a friend first recommended this \\"novel from the sixties about a teacher in a university English department,\\" with the title \\"Stoner,\\" I had an image of Elliot Gould in sideburns and army camo jacket lighting up a joint with dazed, anti-war students and/or hippies.     Originally published in 1965, this novel was a sleeper classic.  Not as well publicized as books by contemporary writers (Salinger, Mailer, Heller, Roth, Bellow, et. al.), Williams' novel is rather a calm, but  emotionally powerful, finely detailed portrait of a gentle academic soul from an earlier generation.    Writing in the clean, spare, down-to-earth voice of the Midwest, Williams gives us what he calls \\"an escape into reality,\\" that reality being the teaching career and complete adult life of Professor William Stoner: his overarching love of literature and teaching, a loveless marriage, and his struggles in not-so-benign Academia. Portraits of the novel's minor characters are also sharply drawn, like Stoner's emotionally frigid wife, Edith, or his nemesis, Hollis Lomax, the hunchback head of the English department with matinee idol face.    Besides Stoner and scholarly writings on Renaissance poetry, John Williams published two volumes of his own poetry and three other novels, each in a totally different setting and genre: the 1973 National Book Award-winning Augustus, Nothing But the Night, and even a western called Butcher's Crossing.     Personally, after reading Stoner, I am eager to \\"discover\\" his other novels.  Williams' use of language is superb in its clarity and not to be missed.      Warning: Skip the novel's \\"Introduction\\" by John McGahern until after reading the novel.  It's a plot-spoiler, totally misplaced and near-superfluous.
0345404475|5.0|I loved this book. It was so different from the film, Blade Runner, which was loosely based on the book and entertaining in its own right. It showed a post apocalyptic time that answered many of the questions the film posed. In this book Deckard has a wife and an android sheep which are props to show you how the people of the future think, function and feel. It is great entertainment with a thought provoking feel to it. Can people of the future really relay on things and ideas we have not thought of yet?  I am now reading the follow up books.    J
0060531053|4.0|I first thumbed through The Complete Joy of Homebrewing while standing in the bookstore and passed it off as too much of a beginner's book. I later borrowed my friend's copy and now have to say this is where I should've started to begin with. It is likely the best beginner's homebrewing book available (which is why you'll see it bundled with beginner's kits in homebrew supply stores) but also really good for intermediate homebrewers like myself. Papazian does a great job of keeping things simple and relaxed, but also packs in the info. I've learned a lot from this title that I should have a long time ago.

0893860220|5.0|Nisargadatta informs the ego and the intellect of all that it is not and he couples this path of knowledge with a profound devotion that will stop your search for enlightenment to realize who you are here and now. You are what you are seeking and in seeking, you cannot be found. We rest in the joy of being, simply \\"I am.\\" This instruction was offered to Nisargadatta by his teacher and with great love and respect for him, he followed his instruction and stopped all effort. In three years, he Self-realized.<br /><br />\\"I am That\\" is divided into 101 chapters and is a compilation of direct dialogues that Nisargadatta had with his students. The translation of the book is natural and flows very nicely. It includes an occassional photograph of Nisargadatta that emulates the devotion that he was sensing at the moment. \\"I am That\\" begins with an Introduction by Douwe Tiermersma on the Philosophical Faculty of Erasmus University in Holland. It is followed by a short Biography of Nisargadatta and a note from the translator about how the book was created as well as a short note from the editor. The first appendix is Nisarga Yoga and shares the simple abode and life of Nisargadatta. The second appendix is Navanath Sampradaya and offers a history and structure of sects in India. The final appendix is a complete and quite helpful glossary of terms found in the book.<br /><br />The dialogues begin with the sense of \\"I am\\" and brings attention to the here and now to live in the present moment. He masterfully moves us beyond the ego and its thinking to stand free of thought, so that we may witness them without identification. He immediately then points to the Awareness and Consciousness that is the perceiving. Nisargadatta also frees us from identification with the body; we are not the person, but rather the Reality that is beyond.<br /><br />We see that the highest bliss is desirelessness and the answer is to turn our mind's attention inward by asking the question, \\"Who am I?\\" He dynamically leads us to a profound detachment from form and to continue resting solely in \\"I am.\\" The only time to realize freedom is Now and that Life can be the teacher, when we allow it to be as it is and notice that life is happening by itself. He shifts us beyond the duality of a pleasure that cycles to pain to realize the Bliss of True Self.<br /><br />When we begin observing, we recognize all that we are not. We brush off the dust of the mind, its time and all of its false concepts and what remains is who we really are. He points that insecurity is not in the life situation and that it is sourced within the dual mind. When we break free of thought and ever more subtle layers of the intellect, we discouver the absolute security of the changeless. Nisargadatta warns that when we follow the desires of the mind, they may be fulfilled, but discontentment will surely once again resurface and that by following desire, we are breeding more desire and that quest will prove to be endless. Beyond the mind, we are free of both fear and desire and therefore free of all suffering.<br /><br />He consistently reminds his students that bondage is a delusion and the freedom of True Self already is within them. He urges to seek the very source of consciousness itself, the deepest root of collective suffering. If it is not eradicated, even after awakening, it will surface to be freed.<br /><br />\\"I am\\" is the foundation of all experience and the doorway to discover ever present peace. Here, we shift beyond all space and time.<br /><br />Sooner or later, you will be lead to this spirtual classic in the maturity of your search for enlightenment. \\"I am That\\" will at last stop the search.

B0012QE4QC|3.0|There seems to be quite a revisionist movement afoot in Hollywood these days. After decades of picturing Henry VIII as a fat, bearded man who could always be seen tearing a bite out of a turkey leg, the type of role Charles Laughton would (and did) play, an image perpetuated by American and British film. In the last few years, there has been a definite effort to make the role seem sexier. Given the shenanigans the Tudors got into, this isn't surprising. Who wants to see Laughton bedding the beautiful, young actress playing Anne Boleyn, or Jane Seymour, or one of his other wives. So Jonathan Rhys-Meyers, the young Irish actor who made a memorable impression in, among other films, Woody Allen's \\"Matchpoint\\", is the King of England in Showtime's \\"The Tudors\\" and Eric Bana (\\"Hulk\\", \\"Munich\\") takes the throne of England in the new film \\"The Other Boleyn Girl\\".<br /><br />Henry the VIII (Bana) is desperate for a male heir to take over the throne of the country when he dies. His wife, Katherine of Aragon (Ana Torrent), has just given birth to a stillborn son and he is so furious he can barely look at her. The scheming Duke of Norfolk (David Morrissey, \\"Basic Instinct 2\\", British TV's \\"Viva Blackpool\\") knows the King will soon stray and fortune will favor whichever family can provide him with a mistress. His brother and sister-in-law, Sir Thomas (Mark Rylance) and Lady Elizabeth (Kristin Scott Thomas, \\"The English Patient\\") have two daughters, Anne (Natalie Portman) and Mary (Scarlett Johansson). The Duke convinces his brother they should host the King and manages to convince him if they were to arrange an affair between the King and Anne, the Boleyn family would be much the better for it. The King arrives and Anne is practically thrust into his face, but he is put off by her forceful nature and comes to fancy Mary instead. But as Mary has just married a merchant whom she loves, this complicates matters, but not much. Anne suspects her sister of going behind her back and their relationship becomes strained. When Mary becomes pregnant, and the pregnancy proves difficult, the family decides to try to make Anne the King's new mistress. But Anne wants more and has since learned how to make men give her what she wants.<br /><br />\\"The Other Boleyn Girl\\", directed by Justin Chadwick (who comes from British television) and based on the popular novel by Philippa Gregory, is a handsomely mounted production, but it can't quite escape the soap opera elements at the core of the story.<br /><br />I'm not sure how Gregory actually researched the subject matter, but this film and \\"The Tudors\\" seem to be plundering the same treasure chest of material. If even a small portion of this material is based in fact, the Tudors were one randy family - and this is a very different view of what we are used to. Royalty is supposed to be noble, elegant, above reproach. This is, of course, the fairy tale version we all grew up with, and anyone with half a wit realizes royalty are real people. And real people with a lot of power and money tend to abuse both. The Tudors were, apparently, no different. Bana's Henry the VIII carries on affairs with women when he becomes the slightest bored with his current wife. It doesn't help their relationship that his wife is unable to provide him with a male heir, someone to leave the throne to, to ensure the stability of the country. As he feels this is his lasting legacy, he feels it is of the utmost importance. His desperation to find an heir, and his randy nature, lead him to the comfort of many women. It even seems to be a well-known secret the King strays. The Duke of Norfolk, one of his trusted advisors, recognizes the signs and wants to ensure his family can benefit from the King's wandering eye.<br /><br />While this is certainly intriguing, the problem is Bana is pretty bland. At one point, Henry the VIII learns one of his gifts has been refused and he blows up, shouting. This is about the extent of the fireworks fromthis man, the King of England, a man who would change the course of his country's history for good and bad. Throughout the rest of the film, he merely walks at a fast pace from one location to another, painting a vivid picture of his frustration, but little else.<br /><br />Eric Bana has been in a number of films and we keep waiting for that \\"Great Eric Bana Performance\\". He came close in Spielberg's \\"Munich\\", but overall, his career has been one big disappointment. He's a good-looking guy, but I suspect he isn't a great actor, which is why his performances are so universally mediocre (i.e., \\"Hulk\\").<br /><br />Natalie Portman plays Anne Boleyn, and she does a pretty good job. When approached by her father and uncle, she is initially intrigued by the idea of becoming the King's mistress. But when this doesn't work out, she is sent to France, to become a member of the Queen's court. Upon her return, she is a different woman. When the family needs her again, she decides to make sure she gets what she wants and starts to manipulate Henry. How does she do this? She refuses his attentions, his gifts and this makes him desire her all the more. In fact, she wants to be Queen. One small problem, Henry is already married and that pesky Catholic Church frowns on divorce. As Anne manipulates the situation to her advantage, and Henry starts to do things that will forever change the course of England's history, Portman makes Anne seem extremely, utterly devious and manipulative in her own right. She clearly did learn a thing or two in that French court.<br /><br />This performance, full of different moods, actions and shenanigans is a role most actors dream for. It allows them to show off their skills. More often than not, this type of performance ultimately becomes hammy and overdone. But Portman manages to play all of the facets of Anne's character while keeping her just this side of human. She doesn't downplay it, she is just more subtle than I could have imagined or believed.<br /><br />Scarlett Johannson plays Mary, the \\"less-attractive\\" daughter of the Boleyn family. So it comes to everyone's surprise, including the audience, when Henry falls for her instead. Mary is supposed to be plain and simply seems more boring than anything else. She wants to marry a common merchant and doesn't seem to have the designs her sister has, so when Henry favors her, she pleads with her family to convince him to take Anne instead. When this doesn't work, she agrees, for the sake of her family. Mary is not the \\"less-attractive\\" daughter. She is simply the less-interesting daughter. As the story begins, the two sisters are inseparable. When the King favors Mary, this puts a strain on their relationship because Anne doesn't believe Mary didn't seduce the monarch. Later, she returns to the court, to plead with Henry to spare Anne's live. He asks her \\"Why are you here?\\" Apparently, he has as much trouble as the rest of us figuring out why she even cares about her sister, because she shows so little emotion.<br /><br />Kristin Scott Thomas plays Lady Elizabeth Boleyn and she is quite good. As a female living in this society, she has a very definite idea of what her role is and could be. Because she has to live by the stringent rules governing women, she is frustrated. But she is not without a certain amount of power. She is frustrated, angered, maddened and annoyed by her husband and brother-in-law's manipulation of her daughters, of their efforts to basically prostitute the two young ladies. She is fully aware their new roles could help the family, but she recognizes how morally wrong the idea is.<br /><br />The film is, as mentioned, handsomely mounted, and despite the soap opera strains in the story, it is an interesting film but it would be a better film with a more mature director at the helm. In virtually every scene, there is at least one shot looking through a doorway, panning across a railing, looking out from the interior of a coach, the fabric fringe obscuring the view, looking through wooden fraught work. It simply becomes annoying. Chadwick is trying to give us the feel of how conspiratorial this society was, how people were likely eavesdropping on everything. But this technique is overused, and abused by about the fifth time it happens. Then, every time it occurs, it stands out like a glaring thumb and draws attention to the fact we are watching a film. When we become conscious we are watching a film, it draws us back to the real world, ruining any chance we have of getting lost in this time, this world, this land of make believe.<br /><br />For that, you are probably better off turning on the television and catching the latest episode of \\"The Tudors\\".\\" daughter of the Boleyn family.

078322737X|5.0|George Lucas gets unharsly criticized for the Star Wars prequels.  Anytime someone argues Lucas's talent, I can show them this.  It is quite a wonderful piece of work.  Lucas is able to incredibly recreate the feeling of being a 1950's kid with American Graffiti.  A wonderful peice reminiscent of another critical film that receives entirely too much backlash, [[ASIN:B00003CXA2 Forrest Gump (Two-Disc Special Collector's Edition)]], both of which recreate the sense of time's past by taking a lighthearted approach to the subject.<br /><br />Ron Howard, Richard Dreyfuss, Cindy Williams, and Suzanne Somers star in Lucas's ode to the 50's.  Just as in [[ASIN:B00003CXCT Star Wars Trilogy (Widescreen Edition with Bonus Disc)]], Lucas transports us to a time and place entirely different but all too familiar.  This is about coming of age in that time but could be attached to any time.  It is quite wonderful.<br /><br />It's also one of the first stories to use, what is now being called hyperlink-cinema, following many main characters throughout one last day of high school.<br /><br />The DVD really only features a Making Of featurette, but the movie is definitely one to see.  It's great.<br /><br />Highly recommended.

B0012Q94QW|1.0|A number of years ago, I read a piece of film criticism written by Roger Ebert. The Pulitzer Prize winning movie critic wrote a review of \\"Caveman\\", a film starring Ringo Starr and Barbara Bach - the filmmakers provided a press kit for the screening listing the words used within the film, the caveman's vocabulary, and the meaning of these words - Ebert used these words to describe how bad \\"Caveman\\" was and it was quite a memorable movie review. I only wish \\"10,000 B.C.\\" was as inventive. Actually, it is inventive in one regard; the depiction of history within the film is laughably inventive.<br /><br />\\"10,000 B.C\\" begins even a few years earlier when a small tribe of cavemen takes in a strange orphan girl with blue eyes. The Old Mother (Mona Hammond) predicts this girl, whom they name Evolet, must become a part of the tribe, and she and D'Leh, a young boy whose father mysteriously leaves the tribe, become friends. Flash forward to 10,000 B.C. and the last Mammoth hunt is here. Now, D'Leh (Steven Strait) and Evolet (Camilla Belle) are attracted to one another. But Tic Tic (Cliff Curtis), D'Leh's defacto father figure claims the warrior who kills a mammoth wins the white spear and Evolet. Well, D'Leh is gonna do both, I tell you what. D'Leh manages to kill the only mammoth and claims his prize. Later that evening, the four-legged beasts (horses to you and I) carry another tribe invading the tribe and they carry Evolet and a number of other women off. D'Leh and Tic Tic set-off to find her and bring her back. They set out leaving Baku (Nathaniel Baring) behind, but the precocious young kid trails behind and soon joins them. Their trek takes them across Africa, where they meet other tribes who have fallen victim to the same marauders and want to help. They join forces with D'Leh. Eventually, they arrive in Egypt and find a number of slaves and wooly mammoths helping to build the pyramids. And Evolet is being held captive. How can they free Evolet and all of their other tribesmen who have become slaves?<br /><br />Co-written and directed by Roland Emmerich (\\"Independence Day\\" - one of the best summer movies ever, \\"The Day After Tomorrow\\"), the film has a grand scale and does a pretty good job of recreating some icons of the caveman era, but pretty bad acting and playing fast and loose with what little we actually know of this period help to ruin the film.<br /><br />We have all seen this type of film before; the director and rest of the production team are so intent on recreating a specific time or place, using all of their skills and tricks to recreate the icons of this era, that they have no time left for the actors. Time or money. The film is filled with actors we have never seen before and they are adequate for the purpose and are certainly no better or no worse than the material they are appearing in. Steven Strait plays D'Leh, the lead. He is handsome, even under the gunk and dirt painted on his body to help him portray the caveman he is supposed to be. I have never seen him in anything before, probably from television or soap operas, and his performance is unremarkable and serviceable to the CGI creatures and effects. Camilla Belle plays Evolet, the love interest and again, she is serviceable to the special effects and unremarkable. This isn't a film you go to expecting to watch the next great Academy Award winning performance. All of the money, time and attention went into recreating wooly mammoths, saber tooth tigers and the ancient pyramids.<br /><br />The film begins with narration by Omar Sharif. He talks about the tribe, the Old Mother, how D'Leh and Evolet met. Throughout the film, he tells us what particular characters are thinking, and experiencing. It is an interesting idea and his voice is fun to listen to. But because he is telling us about people's feelings and motivations, and we aren't seeing this in their performance, it makes the actors seem even more awkward and wooden. Not a good thing for these young actors.<br /><br />During the course of the film, D'Leh and Nakudu come across other tribes during their journey to rescue Evolet. D'Leh's tribe speaks English, but no one else does. This just makes no sense. Of course, they aren't really speaking \\"English\\", but their tribe's language is translated for us and that is what we hear. Every time they come into contact with some other tribe of people, they are speaking a tongue that requires subtitles for us to understand. Worse, when D'Leh and his warriors come into contact with an African tribe, one of their members can speak the same language and communicate with them. But of course, the rest can't. This makes is especially easy for them to become allies and move through Africa enlisting the aid of other troops. It would've been easier for the filmmakers to simply create a language, as the people who made \\"Caveman\\" did. It makes about as much sense.<br /><br />Worse, when the people are speaking English, they use strange, affected accents making their dialogue sound like a badly dubbed Italian gladiator film. Even more unnerving, the tribe of marauders who invade D'Leh's camp and take Evolet speak in some strange tongue, which also sounds as though they might be aliens; their voices sound like they are given the same treatment James Earl Jones voice was given when he voiced Darth Vader.<br /><br />The key obstacle for films recreating periods of time from long ago, times we have little or spotty knowledge of is to make these worlds seem real. Because Emmerich does little to maintain what we actually do know about the timeline of this period, or to make the geography seem real, the film seems completely phony. There just isn't enough in the film to help us believe we are watching a real moment in this history.<br /><br />So, let's talk a little about the \\"history\\" of this film. Cavemen make a trek from their home camp, which is located in a mountain range somewhere, complete with snow and cold temperatures. Their journey takes them into Africa, where they meet many other tribes, and they all band together to rescue the people kidnapped from their tribes and taken to Egypt to help build the pyramids. Okay, so where are these cavemen coming from? Snowy mountains, then trekking through Africa to Egypt? Did they make a u-turn somewhere? Yeah, that's it. They even journey through what looks like a rainforest at one point. Must be one of those fabled rainforests that have completely dried up in the intervening 12000 plus years. Yeah, that's it.<br /><br />But then, the cavemen eventually make it to Egypt where the evil king - priest - priestess - eunuch (not sure) is using the slaves to build the pyramids. Uh huh. Sorry, but even my limited knowledge of history is enough to tell me this never happened. Never could have happened. Yes, I know it is a film, and it isn't trying to be a history lesson.<br /><br />But when a filmmaker makes a film like this, intended for a mass audience, primarily aimed at teens, playing this fast and loose with history, seems, at best, problematic. I know that for every group of teenage boys who goes to this film, at least one of them will end up thinking some caveman was able to travel to Egypt and at least temporarily delay the building of the pyramids. Then, maybe this same teenager will one day believe the ramblings of someone else who believed the Romans never had slaves and will one day grow up to believe the Holocaust never happened.<br /><br />Okay, that is a stretch. \\"10,000 B.C.\\" isn't good enough to be that powerful.<br /><br />Director Roland Emmerich has made better films.

B00005QZ7U|5.0|What more can I say?    This movie re-wrote history. It brought back the movie musical.  Today, movie musicals are arriving head strong in Hollywood. It's like Hollywood and Broadway are having a love fest. IT'S AMAZING!    This is one of my top five favorite movies. Ever. Amazing. Absolutely amazing. Uhhhhh. It gave me chills when I first heard it.    PLEASE NOTE: You CANNOT buy the sheet music for these songs. The only song available for purchase in sheet music form is Come What May. This is because Come What May is the ONLY original song from the show. All others are old\\"er\\" pop songs, written by major artists over the past 30 years. Madonna, Queen, and Elton John are some of the artists whose material is re-mastered and covered in this film.    BUY ME!  \\"The best thing in the world is to love, and be loved in return...\\"
B000UD0ESA|5.0|If you are Sci-Fi fan, this is a must see film.  Based on the story by a science fiction writer Philip K. Dick, this story is about human androids who have 4 year life span.  They are almost identical to humans except that they do not have the same emotions.  Due to defect that they have, government has arranged that they are put into permanent \\"retirement\\".  Hunters of these androids are known as Blade Runners.  We get to know a few of them and we get to understand their rage of being created by men, enslaved by men and forced to die too quick.  They are fine specimens, beautiful, athletic, willing to submit to the purpose they are created for with no resistance.  But they also want to live and are ready to do whatever it takes to fight for their own survival.  It is no wonder that by the end of the movie we get to like them in spite of their brutality because we get to realize that real humans would react the same way in similar circumstances.  Also, the fact that the hunter (Harrison Ford) becomes the hunted is what makes this film great.
B00133KHCY|5.0|VERY well done!  3 cheers!  My husband and I really liked this.  It will make you laugh and cry.  I rented this because I wasn't sure we'd like it but as soon as it was over I told my husband I wanted to buy it.  He agreed. It's a wonderful story I'll enjoy watching every time!
B000MR9D5E|5.0|Absolutely astonishing.  When I purchase something I always look at the negative reviews and ask myself if it seems better than that.  This is.  This is not blood and gore.  It is beauty and grace.  You will see some things you have seen before in a whole new way.  Don't let the negatives steer you away, even though some animals die in the making of this film.  IT IS NATURE.  DO YOU WANT THE WOLF TO STARVE AND  D I E!

B0000DAOHN|4.0|Stephanie Plum is the most delicious heroine in all of chick lit.  This book is halfway through the expected series of sixteen numbered books.<br /><br />In this book, Stephanie agrees to help out Mabel, a lady who lives next door to her parents by looking for Evelyn, Mabel's granddaughter.  It's an unpaid job, and Stephanie still has to earn her living working as a bounty hunter for her creepy cousin, Vinnie.  Stephanie still has difficulty busting and bringing in the lowlifes and a lot of good comedy ensues from Stephanie trying to make a buck, such as the time she goes after Andy Bender and winds up buying a t-shirt for two dollars.  It might be a losing proposition for Stephanie but it is a plus for the reader.<br /><br />But searching for Evelyn and her little daughter Annie has its dangers.  Evelyn's abusive husband Steve and criminal landlord Eddie Abruzzi start making it hot for Stephanie.<br /><br />She's also worried because her mentor and very hot friend Ranger made a deal with her and now the deal has come due and what's her on-again-off again boyfriend Joe Morelli going to say about that?<br /><br />Stephanie endears because she isn't perfect but she is persistent.  You have to love her, unless you sell car insurance.  The car that bites the  dust in this is a Honda CR-V, first by goose attack and then a bear and a rabbit throw a bomb in it.  (No, I'm not going to explain.  You have to read this book.)
B0010YSD7M|3.0|Sure, it was great to see the characters, more like old friends now,  that I've missed since Stargate SG-1 ended, but this long awaited TV movie felt more like two average episodes than anything like I hoped it would be.<br /><br />I thought something was strange when the opening credits were white letters over white snow in the mountains.  Some very hard to even read. How did that get past someone?  Just a nit, but it made me wonder what I was in for.  Caution, spoilers follow.<br /><br />First, I was disappointed that the story revolved around a magic weapon that solves all our problems if we can only find it, which of course we know we will eventually.  That made the whole adventure more or less predictable.<br /><br />What follows is a lot of lets say very conveniently written stuff with some strange transitions.  We've got the Odyssey going through the Super Stargate in one scene and immediately Vala and Daniel are sitting at a table in a villiage in Ori occupied space.  That was easy.<br /><br />Then here come the replicators, again.  Replicators have already been done in the SG-1 series, where they were an original idea to the series, and in Atlantis, where it made me think the Atlantis writers had run out of ideas, and now here they are again!  Once again we are treated to scene after scene of heavy and light machine guns mowing down replicators while the bullets do absolutely no damage to anything that isn't a replicator.  It got corny a while ago, folks.  By the way, why did the characters weld and bolt the doors to the Asgard Core room shut if it had already been established in the show that the little bugs can just melt their way through metal?<br /><br />Then there's the new twist: the gross zombie replicator human, and the endless fight between this thing and Mitchell, which ends with the terminator (er..oops..replicators) forming a human skeleton after all the flesh has been burned away.<br /><br />Why is it that all of a sudden these Ori mother ships aren't so tough, and four of them can pound away at the Odyssey for endless minutes while the replicator problem is taken care of, and then once the replicators are defeated the Ori ships all of a sudden become an urgent threat again?<br /><br />How can Teal'c get a Ori weapon blast in the back, get left for dead, and in the morning feel great enough to go mountain climbing, complete with incredibly corny not-too-Stargate-like melodramatic music playing?  He falls flat on his face but gets supernatural help to recover.  Later, he somehow penetrates the Ori city and shows up in a Pryor's uniform to rescue our heros, but we never get to see how he did it!<br /><br />One thing I forgot to mention at first, Samantha Carter seems to come across more like a soccer mom than a military person.  Maybe because her hair seemed long for a military person, or because she baked cookies for Mitchell and kissed him on the cheek while she had her hair completely down while on base at the end of the episode.  I don't know, but something seemed tweaked about Sam.  Of course, I'm not caught up on season four of Atlantis.<br /><br />Finally, the super villian in this story is dispatched just the way the super villian Anubis is dispatched in the Threads episode.<br /><br />Anyway, I thought will all the extra time available to make this movie I'd get to see something fresh and somewhat original, but it was the same old same old.  At least the Ori story arc was brought to a close.<br /><br />Bottom line: see if you can see it without paying full retail.nd away at the Odyssey for endless minutes while the replicator problem is taken care of, and then once the replicators are defeated the Ori ships all of a sudden become an urgent threat again?

B00005JMK0|5.0|I would buy this for the music alone.  Jeff Lynne is awesome, not to mention Giorgio Moroder.    The 80s nostalgiac take on the home PC beginning to infect everyday America is a lot of fun.  Bud Cort brings Edgar to life in a perfectly heartfelt way.  And, Virginia Madsen (in her 2nd movie ever) is ...awesome. (Did I mention that already?)    One of my all-time favorite movies.  How long must we wait for the obvious!?  Do I have to spell it out?D...V...D please
0316010669|4.0|Some interesting observations: but Gladwell could have been clearer about highlighting the fact that what he is talking about is really trained intuition.  That is, experts trained by years of study - or even scientifically determined heuristics - can make snap decisions, not just anyone.
B0013FDM7E|4.0|When you look at `I Am Legend' you may initially shrug it off as nothing more than summer blockbuster popcorn fluff; just another horror film targeting today's youth and wasting our hard earned money.  You will most likely still go see it because, quite frankly, no one can resist Will Smith.  The film will start and you'll think that the depictions of New York, barren and desolate, are pretty creepy.  You'll see Smith driving a hundred miles an hour down the empty streets and you'll wish you could do that.  You'll see him hunting deer with his dog and it'll all seem pretty cool but what you won't realize is that you are slowly being drawn into the loneliness that is Robert Neville's existence.  You will watch his everyday life unfold and you'll find yourself feeling cold and distant and alone.  Before a single `vampire' appears on the screen you will be petrified.<br /><br />`I Am Legend' works so well because Will Smith is really that good in it.  Regardless of what anyone says, Will Smith is one excellent actor.  He's the type of actor that has everything you need to be successful.  He's attractive, he has charm and charisma; he's a riot in person and on film but he can also evoke very mature and stunning emotions that many wouldn't assign him.  In that respect he always proves himself a surprise to the viewer.  Here is no exception.  He elevates what could have been nothing more than a Hollywood monster movie into a serious and commanding look at loneliness and desperation.  In fact I'll be so blunt as to say that the best scenes in this film are when Will Smith is the only person on the screen, when he is alone and vulnerable; not when he is being pursued by the monsters.<br /><br />`I Am Legend' is the third revamping of Richard Matheson's 1954 novel of the same name.  It tells the story of Robert Neville, a scientist who happens to be the only survivor after an outbreak turns the world's population into walking zombies, or vampires.  He walks the streets of Manhattan during the daylight with his loyal German Shepherd Samantha and hides in his home at night while the creatures roam the streets looking for food.  During the day he attempts to live a life that is as normal as possible.  He sets up mannequins in video stores and carries on conversations with them.  He sticks to a schedule of exercise and meals and hunting.  He drives in his car and listens to Bob Marley and talks to his dog and pretty much does everything he can to stay sane.  He also broadcasts a message over the airwaves everyday looking for other survivors and he waits at the dock everyday at a specific time for them to arrive.<br /><br />The first half of `I Am Legend' plays out much better than the second because it's a slow build of human emotion.  Watching Smith's desperation grow across his face we are brought into his life and his situation and we feel his pain.  The second half, which introduces to us the creatures as well as another human survivor, steps a little bit away from the focus on Neville's loneliness and tries a little too hard to force fear on us by using the creatures.  This fear would have been much more rewarding had the creatures not looked so CGI animated.  They somewhat take away from the realness and rawness of the film when they look more like aliens then mutated humans.<br /><br />One thing that remains on point throughout though is Will Smith.  This may be one of his finest performances to date, seriously.  The emotion that he portrays his so real, so strong.  There is one scene in particular, where he breaks down crying in the video store as he begs for a female mannequin to talk to him, that got me all choked up.  His performance is so committed, so vital to the film that you can't help but give him props for delivering a very believable and very moving performance.<br /><br />In the end there are some things I would have changed here.  I would have hired actual actors for the roles of the `vampires' (although I hear that they had initially done that but felt that they looked too much like mimes) because I feel that the CGI was a little overdone.  I would have stuck a little closer to the book and eliminated the `other' survivor.  But there are too many things that I would have left alone; that work so well here that it seems silly to complain.  The first half of the film is in a word `perfect' and that alone is enough to elevate the rest of the film.  Smith is a goldmine of emotion here and delivers a solid award worthy performance that tops his Oscar nominated performance from last year.<br /><br />If the CGI creatures hadn't spoiled my fun (just a little) I would be quick to label `I Am Legend' as one of the best films of 2007.  That little issue aside though, `I Am Legend' is far better than some may expect and will definitely leave you with much to talk about.that they looked too much like mimes) because I feel that the CGI was a little overdone.

B000XVT7SW|5.0|When I ordered this DVD several weeks ago, I didn't realize that these were filmed, as opposed to live performances of Cav/Pag.  I have a decent live Pagliacci performance (from the Met, paired with Puccini's Il Tabarro), but there don't seem to be any live, staged DVD performances available of Cavalleria Rusticana.  Upon receiving the DVD, I was initially disappointed, because even though the lip-synching is very well done here, I much prefer seeing a staged, live performance to a filmed, on-location presentation such as this.<br /><br />Nonetheless, this DVD set gets five very favorable stars from me, not only due to the impeccable sound and picture quality of performances from 40 years ago, but primarily because of the acting and singing of a force of nature named Jon Vickers in Pagliacci.<br /><br />I was not fortunate enough to have seen Mr. Vickers, the Canadian heldentenor, on stage.  I have his Peter Grimes from Covent Garden on DVD, and his performance there is intelligent, nuanced and oftentimes searing in intensity.  In this Pagliacci, his performance is nearly overwhelming:  I don't think I have ever seen such frightening, impassioned, murderous rage on display before in an opera performance, whether filmed or otherwise.  As noted by Mike Birman in yet another of his spot-on Amazon reviews, Mr. Vickers was the full package, ladies and gentlemen -- and I only wish there was a DVD of his Fidelio somewhere out there.<br /><br />Very, very highly recommended.
B000YXMMAE|5.0|Not over the top....not even to simple...but just right...everything fits like a \\"Jigsaw Falling Into Place\\"...Jazzy tunes could leave some scratching their heads....but the diversty of the sounds and how different/same sounding is unheard of, and upbeat if u want them to be, or downbeat if u want them to be...sounds crazy i know...    Simple songs which are very effective in producing amazing songs..hmm?
0684833395|5.0|That about says it all.  I had no idea what to expect when I picked up Heller's masterpiece and perhaps that was part of the wonderful-ness: it was a total surprise.  After reading Catch-22, my outlook on life was completely thrown for a loop. No book has ever made me think and reevaluate as this one did.  A perfect novel - it makes you laugh, it makes you feel sad, it makes you think and it stays with you. I am ever amazed at the intricacy with which the novel is structured and how the story unfolds.  I re-read Catch-22 regularly.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|This was both my boyfriend's and mine favorite tv series. It got canceled. Then my friend had this and I loved it. I decided to get it for my boyfriend  (and I). I am really happy with it. It was also inexpensive.
B00006AVRK|5.0|In my opinion, this is the most consistently funny British comedy team since Monty Python!  Laurie and Fry could not have been cast more perfectly as Wooster and Jeeves respectively. Simon Langton (who also directed the superb BBC version of Pride & Prejudice) does a stunning job on the first season and he may be the best director that the series encountered. However, I highly recommend all of the DVDs - I always pull out Jeeves and Wooster when I need a pick-me-up. Family and friends have also caught the Wooster bug and are watching the episodes voraciously!  As a side note, fans of \\"House\\" (which also stars Hugh Laurie) will be impressed with the actor's range - Bertie Wooster is a total about face from Gregory House but equally as watchable!  Enjoy!
B00005JPTK|4.0|Loved it. You could really feel the sense of loss when Neville has to do the unthinkable to his most loved companion. But for a similar movie that will haunt your mind for days pick up The Quiet Earth.
B0010358D0|2.0|This film looks great, but it's story is about as predictable and hackneyed as most 80's-era action movies.  It's predictable, bland, and boring.  None of the complexity of Shirow's manga is present in this cash-grab despite a multitude of opportunities to expand the philosophical edge of the story.  Unfortunately, this is one to skip entirely.
B0010V4TZU|4.0|Clever and truly enjoyable.  You can hear influences but nothing that says \\"these guys sound exactly like...\\".  It is a perfect album for working out, for a nice drive on a warm/sunny day, for a clam bake on the shore.  Perfect summer tunes.  It is refreshing to put a disc on and hear the difference between songs.  After reading some of the other reviews, I find that some people are not getting this band.  Surely these are not people who appreciate Indie/Alternative type music but bought this album because they heard that these guys had a really awesome video out.   If you are looking for a great summer album, lacking pretension and the cookie-cutter version of Alternative/Pop, well, then this is your band.  This is a group that I will keep an eye on in future.
B000ASATZ8|5.0|Loved the Tremors Attack Pack! Was wonderful to watch the marathon of shows without a VHS tape falling apart or going grainy. Only thing I wish it had was a language control to bleep or eliminate their taking the Lord's name in vain. Movies don't need that kind of language to be great.  Other than that, it was fantastic. Something I can watch over and over again (and have...), not extremely gory. In fact, in comparison with some of the other shows out there, it rates a small to medium in gore - a nice, refreshing change!
1576754499|5.0|Polak comes from a very practical, farmer-focused perspective that acknowledges the broader poverty debate but puts a premium on what the farmer wants and needs, and focuses on market-based products and solutions that help farmers get out of poverty.  The drip irrigation systems, treadle pumps, water storage and other products described in the book are the definition of demand-driven and are offered at prices farmers can afford and in ways that make money for those providing the products.  All of the solutions in the book are offered through markets, and always take into account scalability and sustainability (acknowledging the need for some subsidy or other financing mechanism up front to prove the case).     The power of Polak's arguments are in the examples that he weaves throughout the book. (His skepticism of \\"the experts\\" comes through in some of the examples in helpful ways as well).  After having read a number of the current development thinkers, I would recommend this book above the others for its ability to start with the needs of the poor farmer, highlight solutions, explain why they are sustainable through markets, and issue a challenge to development professionals and product designers around the world for how to make money while also serving the needs of the poor who represent a large and untapped market.     The book made me want to go out and start a business that serves such large unmet needs.  I highly recommend the book - a good read and a great, practical, down-to-earth reminder of what matters to people who live on less than $1/day -- affordability and practical use.
B000HC2LI0|5.0|This program has been an inspiration to me from the moment I first watched it to the final scenes.  The mix of humour, drama, tension and education (and that's usually in the first five minutes) consistantly results in episodes of pure quality.    The Complete Series Collection is everything you ever hoped for and much more.  The quality of the packaging has been so well thought out that it just oozes Presidential class and the bonus material is the icing on the cake.  I had bought one of the other single season sets but when I saw this, I knew that it was just exactly what I was looking for.    Any fan of the show should invest in this.  They will not be disappointed.

B00005JPSL|3.0|My wife and I watched this because we had seen the original of it, a German film titled \\"Mostly Martha,\\" which was much better, subtitles and all. The actors were better looking in the American edition, but they weren't anywhere nearly as convincing as in the original.  I say this even though I'm a sucker for the nine-year-old \\"Sunshine\\" girl.  Rent \\"Mostly Martha\\" to see a film I'd rate 5 stars.
1596912855|4.0|This fun book is like the apple tart that Mr. Woodhouse would have Emma serve to her friend, Miss Smith.  Just a little bit will not hurt you!  It's a small guilty pleasure, like it would be to take a small bit of apple tart--when the whole world knows you're supposed to be on a diet!     To truly devoted Austen fans, those who only once or twice may have seen the BBC productions, who prefer to read literary critiques of her work than swoon over Colin Firth, this may be a book they would prefer to read at home, stealthily and in the dark.  Perhaps pretend it's a gift for a friend...    To the rest of us who, are not wholly ashamed of our devotion to Darcy ala' Colin Firth but are just so relieved to know we were not the only ones, this book is a fun and silly read.  Enjoyable because it does not try to BE Jane Austen, it does not try to QUOTE Jane Austen in trite and not-so-clever ways, it does not involve any time travel to MEET Jane Austen, it does not take itself too seriously, and it is family friendly.      It does involve several similar plots from Jane Austen novels, which are not out of place in a holiday retreat catering to Austen fans/groupies.  It does tend to push the Darcy character maybe just a tad, and Darcy and Lizzy banter is somewhat overly recreated in some scenes, but does not detract from the enjoyment of it as a whole.  One reviewer mentioned that the ending is not exactly a surprise, but it is a fresh take on it and sometimes we do enjoy a book with an ending as warm and comfortable as a favorite chair, this one just has new upholstery on it!    Go ahead, give it a try and then you may just want to re-read those favorite books that started the whole craze in the first place...but of course, start with Pride and Prejudice!!  Enjoy!
B00004TWZF|5.0|I stumbled across this movie at the age of 18 in 1990, when living in Europe. I couldn't believe it and didn't know who to love harder, Enzo or Jacques. It had such a profound effect on me, I then went on to read everything I could get my hands on about Jacques Costeau. After seeing the movie on TV I went straight to the video store and got out the film, and to my dismay it was a 2 hr and heavily edited movie. I cried to the video store person who had never heard of an extended version. Several months later I found a copy in a tiny video store in Ireland. I bought it on the spot. It has remained my favourite movie of all time, right up there with Cinema Paradiso, My Life as a Dog, Blade Runner and Taxi Driver.     I still take baths like Jacques uncle. It seems a nicer way to do it.

B00004XMV6|5.0|I was 14 when I saw this for the first time (1986). I knew of both the actors, Mickey Rourke from Rumble Fish and Kim Basinger from Never Say Never Again but I saw the movie because I'd read that John Taylor from Duran Duran had written a song specifically for the soundtrack and I loved him. Mickey Rourke woke me from my childhood crush and caused a lot of problems for me as I went search for my own private Rourke. The soundtrack carries the film, as does the cruelness of Mickey Rourke's character and game playing.

1590172213|3.0|This book is a great idea, but, it seems that content is missing. It's as though the general idea is there, however, the author could have expanded ideas or methods in which the characters could be in contact with one another. I realize its a children's book though, so it cant be too full of information. Good book, I remembered it from my childhood and had to find it. I recommend it!
B00006AW2O|5.0|Great disc, but I'll have to buy it again, because I wanted the hybrid SACD version in the pretty card stock case, not the DSD Remastered version in the standard plastic jewel case. I think the only way to be sure is to buy at a retail outlet where you can see what you're getting.
B0013FDM7E|3.0|This is an entertaining movie if you like action with no storyline. This is not a very intelligent movie.    The storyline is as follows: A researcher is able to change the Measles virus into becoming a cure for Cancer. However, the virus mutates inside the body and turns people into monsters. The virus becomes airborne and all of humanity becomes infected. The story takes place in New York, where the character of Will Smith is the only human survivor. Lions and tigers are free to roam the streets of New York (probably escaped from the zoo), and they compete with the character of Will Smith for the ultimate food: deer! At night, the monsters, or more precisely, the diseased humans, roam the streets looking for flesh. They can only hunt at night, for sunlight mysteriously burns them up. Will Smith eventually finds the cure, and humanity is saved! The end.    The best part was the story about Bob Marley. I didn't know Marley appeared for his concert two days after he was shot. I never knew that. I ended up downloading all of Marley's songs from iTunes.    For visual effects (or special effects if you prefer) I give it 5 stars. The images of New York after the extinction of man are spectacular. But amazing visual effects alone do not make a movie. The storyline is a bit too simplistic, and it seemed like the director was in a hurry to end it. There are no twists to the story; no moments of thrill and intrigue. The movie is actually predictable.    One thing I can say is that I was amazed by the muscular body of Will Smith. Will he become the next Rambo?
1400063515|4.0|It's quite an experience to finish reading _The Black Swan_ during the week in which one of America's most storied investment banks implodes and the wheels appear to have largely come off for the entire banking and (purportedly) hedging industry. I've also just read an article in the FT (from 17/03/08) in which Greenspan attempts to shift the entire blame for the meltdown on to poor risk models. No kidding?    So on one level, current events seem to be bearing out the core argument of _The Black Swan_: that years of 'careful' investing (Bear Sterns made its first lost since its founding this past quarter) can be obliterated by a single unforeseen event (sub-prime mortgages collapsing and taking the credit markets with them as everyone shuts down lending).    So, the relevance of this book goes a long way towards redeeming its arrogant style and irritating structure. I suppose that arrogance is fairly standard in the financial sector (and see where that got the banks!), but I tend to prefer a *little* humility in my books, especially when they talk about the underlying uncertainty in markets and in life. I also felt that at times the book resembled a kitchen sink of ideas -- it jumps between power laws and firm reputation without so much as a 'by your leave' -- and that a good editor could have forced _The Black Swan_ into something a bit more rounded and (at times) coherent. I would advise, for instance, reading _Six Degrees_ before reading _The Black Swan_ so as to be able to make more sense of the random pages that cover networks and network theory.    In spite of my issues with the *format* of _The Black Swan_, I still found the *content* to be extremely valuable for someone with a modest background in statistics and a level of conceptual comfort somewhere between 'cocktail party' and 'cocktail party with financial types'. So with several paperback versions now in print and daily evidence from the financial and real estate markets of the critical effect of \\"it'llnever happen here\\" scenarios on the real world I'd strongly recommend a trip down to the local bookshop to pick up a copy.
B001453LX8|2.0|When i found out Miss Badu had a new album out, I was hyped, I couldn't wait to hear it. Unfortunately, what I was subjected to was definitely not what I expected, and ultimately disappointing for someone that i recognize as an extremely talented artist. Erykah definitely sticks with her own style of abstract, socially conscious, jazzy, groovy type music, but this time around I think she tried to experiment with something a little different and it just didnt work out too well. There is a very psycadelic feel on this album, but its not for everybody. It certainly wasnt for me. I found myself actually fast forwarding through songs in order to see if they would eventually get good, or at least decent, which ended up with me skiping a good portion of the CD. granted, I did listen to the entire CD at least once, just so be fair, but honestly, this one is probably better off being passed up unless you find it in the $5 or less bin somewhere. Erykah is one of the most talented female music artists out there, but like many brilliant artists, she or her work can be misunderstood or just way ahead of its time, or can just plain suck. I have a feeling she will redeem herself the next time around.<br /><br />Purchase at your own risk, but at least give it a sample. Peace
B00005MP58|5.0|Compared to other available reproductions of Jane Austen's Pride & Prejudice, the dialog is very accurate - which makes this a long film, but a must have for any Jane Austen lover, or for any admirer of Mr. Darcy, whom Colin Firth portrays excellently.
0596007124|5.0|I don't writes reviews, but this book was too good that I get forced from inside to write good about it. This book has every thing that you want to learn about design patterns.  This book is good for all level starting from Beginner to Advanced. And it has a different way of teaching that wills directly starting to make sense. Examples are based on real life problems, so it's definitely great book ever written on design patterns.  Two Thumbs up!!!
B000SFJWLU|5.0|I would have to say that by far this is one of if not the best CD I have purchased in years normally I don't buy whole cds I just do the iTunes thing and grab the songs I like but after getting to listen to the full cd I realized that wouldn't work for me this time as I liked the entire cd 1-10 all great I've had the cd in my truck since I bought it and only taken it out once when my g/f complained about me playing it too much :)
0743297334|5.0|I made the mistake of first reading this book in seventh grade, and at that time I had no idea what the hell Hemingway was talking about. It took me until my late twenties to get back to him -- and then I was sorry about all the time I'd wasted. What a blend this book is, simultaneously spare and moving, macho and sensitive, quickly-read and long to dwell in the reader. I've returned to this book since the adult re-read, and I'll be back many more times in years to come.
0553288105|5.0|This book is a well-written, enjoyable read that should be on everybody's reading list, whether a science fiction fan or not. One of the attributes of the genre allows the author to get a message across in an entertaining, non-pedantic manner. This book's message is playing out today and if the world's leaders aren't convinced to listen to those voices crying warnings galore Asimov's hope that, \\"the war against folly may be won after all\\" will never come to pass. Sometimes we need reminders that it's possible to make others listen and that we need not give in to just \\"making the best of things\\".
0670033375|4.0|Jared Diamond provides some interesting thoughts, and provides the background to support his ideas and concepts. Allows the reader to thinlk through the individual issues - what set up the fall, what was happening in the environment (human, political, etc.), and did they see it coming.  Thought provoking - a good read. Wish all the political candidates would read this - it might change some of their thought processes.
B000YXMMAE|5.0|This is the first review I've ever written for any album or band ever. I'm fanatical about music, have been for my whole life, and am an active musician. The problem is, I've never truly liked 90% of the music or bands I've ever heard.. ever. Radiohead is in that 10% that hits the nail on the head for me musically. From 'OK Computer' on, every album has been some of the most unique & saintly creations ever put together.     I absolutely love what Radiohead has become after their sub-par mainstream albums like 'The Bends'. They are one of the only bands that are making music that is as close to visual art that's ever existed.   Like a few previous Radiohead albums, 'In Rainbows' was confusing for me at first. I didn't understand what they were doing, and thought maybe they're losing it. Their music is so unique & new, it's hard for many people to understand it at first, and 'In Rainbows' is no exemption.    I'd have to say 'Bodysnatchers', 'Weird Fishes' & 'Jigsaw Falling Into Place' are my favorites right now. But it may change. They're all good in some respects, but some tracks may take a while to grow on you.     Thom Yorke has to be the most creative male vocalist alive. His melodies are an instrument in itself. I don't even care about the lyrics half the time because I'm lost in the melody. I continue to be amazed, and I almost want to thank them for continuing to make music that's genuinely good.

006135323X|5.0|Predictably Irrational is an exceptional book on a number of fronts.<br /><br />First, from the writing style, it is absolutely accessible and that isn't always the case when academians convert research into a book designed for the mass market. This book is as accessible and interesting to read as Freakonomics was.<br /><br />Second, this is the first book to do such a thorough job of connecting psychology, human behavior and economics.<br /><br />This book should be an immediate read for every marketer, salesperson, CEO or non-profit without exception.<br /><br />When you read this book you'll learn about how you and I make decisions and if you are honest you'll recognize yourself over and over in the reading. You and I make decisions the same way everyone else does. And, as a marketer, a salesperson, a funds solicitor for a non-profit, we'll make more, get more and achieve more to the extent that we leverage these automatic processes.<br /><br />Most people don't fight or even acknowledge their own decision making processes, they just go through the process. What they think is control is really an illusion as this book so clearly points out. You and I can and are regularly influenced subliminally by the way information is presented.<br /><br />The chapters on Free and the chapter on The Fallacy of Supply and Demand are invaluable. Ariely's explanation of price anchoring will change how you think about MSRP or even your intitial pricing discussion in sales. His experiement using the last two digits of your social security number is very eye opening. This is also an example of something very easy for you to test in your own marketing organization or social group.s<br /><br />Interestingly, where at the time of this review we are facing a recession, I find this book essential reading for those who would change the face of the recession as well as the duration.<br /><br />It was interesting to me to read some of the negative reviews of the book but most of them focused on wanting to challenge the conclusions without reading all of the research papers. And, I didn't see many of the people who were critical provide the level of observational credibility that Mr. Ariely does.<br /><br />This book just made it to my desktop library, the 10 books I'll refer back to again and again when I create marketing material, influence strategies or consult with clients.<br /><br />This book is a powerful read.of the research papers.

B0011FXLCC|5.0|I prefer when bands make groundbreaking albums, and this one is clearly not, but its still amazing. While Black Cherry and Supernature were more edgy sounding, this album creates much more of a sound landscape. And its more refined, and utilizes Allison's great vocals better, than Felt Mountain. Whether you are an old fan or a newcomer to Goldfrapp, I highly recommend this whole album. Do not just purchase particular songs because they won't have the same impact as the entire album.
0486424545|2.0|If you read this novel on your own (as in, it is not assigned to you as a form of assigned reading in school) then you will enjoy it because you obviously know what you're getting yourself into: whimsical dialogue between gossiping British ladies. I do realize how ridiculous and inaccurate this description is but I'm mad because I have been forced to read this book for school and I really hate it so therefore my opinion of it is very negative. Teachers should not force these types of books upon their students. The rate of enjoyment for this book is very limited to those who either teach English or have a keen interest in it. Very few students will be able to appreciate and enjoy this novel for its merits, of which I'm sure there are many.    I do not expect this review to be helpful to anyone who is looking at this book as a means of pleasure reading.

B00004VWAF|1.0|This piece of garbage was pieced together by Miles Davis and Teo Macero from a selection of various studio improvisations and it sounds like it - the musical equivalent of Frankenstein's monster in its ugliness and lack of charm.<br /><br />This thankfully was the last time Davis + record company used the cut and paste method, done I suspect for the purely commercial reason of making a product that fitted a single piece of vinyl.<br /><br />A much better experience can be had from some of the original, relatively unedited pieces on [[ASIN:B000TLMWMO The Complete On the Corner Sessions]] box set where things are more musically coherent - worth the money for  Disc 4 alone, (especially the profound and utterly enchanting 32 minute \\"Calypso Frelimo\\", a favorite of Wadada Leo Smith).

B000W91RUG|5.0|I am a huge fan of friends, but nothing -- not even that show -- can top the hilarity of The Big Band Theory. I am one of those people who enjoy funny stuff, but never really show it on the outside (i.e. I don't laugh out loud very easily at sitcoms or funny sketches), but I added 20 years to my life by laughing over this show. Yes, the writing is very clean and smart, the actors are wonderful, and the situations are funny, but the factor that makes this show so funny, is that these are situations that nerds might actually get into. It's all typical nerd stuff that probably would happen to nerds in the real world. Everyone should try this show out. Most of the time its just plain old funny.

B000003TA4|5.0|Countless people have written countless reviews and opinions about this album, but until you hear it and listen over and over to it, you can not feel the power and rage packed into this Seattle classic. Nirvana constructed a masterpiece of alternative rock that is still widely talked about almost 17 years after its release. \\"Smells Like Teen Spirit\\" alone rocked a nation of youth that finally had a band truly representing them. Although I was much too young at the time this album was released to fully appreciate it, I heard it in its entirety a few years later and the music just seems to express any feelings of angst or depravity you might be feeling all wrapped up in pulse-pounding punk/alternative rage that just never quits. This album will live on as one of the greatest albums ever recorded.
B000XNZ7LG|4.0|I loved this movie, an epic saga of human endurance and sacrifice.  The HD DVD video quality is probably the best I've seen and the audio quality was excellent also.  The story itself was tremendous, in the nature of Schindlers list, but not quite as moving or as hard hitting as that movie. The main actors ineptitude and lethargy at times was frustrating, but it is a true story, and remarkable none the less.  Great entertainment and well worth the small purchase price, this is a movie that will be played several more times over the years.  My wife, 13 year old son and 10 year old daughter enjoyed it also,  I highly recommend it.
B00000272N|5.0|Alice in Chains is an interesting band to listen to for several reasons. They have a very unique sound, even though they represented the Seattle grunge movement the band is very harmonious and haunting to listen to but also busts out its share of metal jams that split the amplifiers in half. Alice in Chains' debut is their finest metal record with pulsing guitars and hard drumming wrapped up with Layne Staley's soothing vocals the band provides an easily accessible yet complicated sound in the sense that it can not be pinned down into one genre. Alice in Chains used this as a liftoff point and this album is considered one of the finest of the grunge era.
B000ZLFALI|3.0|[[ASIN:B000ZLFALI Across the Universe (Two-Disc Special Edition)]]<br /><br />I love music, and I love the Beatles.  I also love movies, even the sometimes pretentious art movies.  But I'm really picky when it comes to musicals, and generally don't like song remakes that don't add something new.  So where does that leave me with \\"Across the Universe?\\"  I love it and hate it all at once!<br /><br />The Good<br /><br />The music in this movie is mostly really good semi-acoustic versions of late Beatles songs.  And believe me, the music is really good.  If you love the Beatles, even purists may appreciate the updated versions to many of these songs.  Some (such as Lucy in the Sky With Diamonds) were better off the first time.  [[ASIN:B000WCBPOG Across The Universe [Deluxe Edition]]]<br /><br />This movie was nominated for Costume Design at the Academy Awards, yet it could have gotten a bunch of technical nominations including Art Direction, Cinematography and Sound.  While most people ignore those categories, I think they all matter a lot.  Technically this is a very hard movie to make.  It sounds great and looks great.<br /><br />The Bad<br /><br />The story and the songs have almost no relationship to the original songs that are used as the skeleton for the movie.  Musicals are hard enough to like.  Even though the music is very well done as far as adaptations and remakes go, the transitions can be annoying with dialogue taken from song lyrics.  And the way some of the characters are flatly filmed singing / talking will make you remember those terrible Gap commercials. So while there are some cool elements, the end result feels somewhat cheesy sometimes.<br /><br />Also, some of the people here seem to have been chosen for their singing more than their acting, because the supporting cast is spotty.<br /><br />Not to mention, for those who don't like art movies or the Beatles, I can see how this could be annoying.<br /><br />Somebody like me should have seen this in a movie theatre, because as a DVD the grand scale of some of the scenes seemed lost on my very modest sized TV.<br /><br />Conclusion<br /><br />If you like art films, musicals, the Beatles, or lust after one or several of the stars, you will like this.  If you like movies that have a logical plot and great acting you may have trouble with this one.<br /><br />This movie very much seems like it was made to be watched while high.

0596527055|5.0|I found a lot of wisdom in this book.  Like a lot of programmers, I've wanted to be part of innovative work.  This describes in very good detail why it is hard to find that kind of environment in a large company.  It also explains why startups are great places for innovation.  Either way, if you want to understand how technology evolves, this book gives a lot of evidence to support new theories on the topic.
B000ZN802W|5.0|I enjoyed reading Krakauer's book at least ten years ago.  The book accepted the responsibility of trying to \\"solve the mystery\\" of McCandless's death, which at first glance is the only reason we'd be interested in this story.<br /><br />Yet Krakauer's narrative incorporated the whole story of the young man, not just the specific events that lead to his death.  Was this because facts were desperately hard to come by (from Chris's acquaintances, the McCandless family, and certainly from Chris himself)?  Did Krakauer's editor needed some bulk (as I originally thought)?  Or was it because the nature of McCandless's realty was the more important story?<br /><br />Coming after the book, the movie must accept the burden of its predecessor.  But in the case of \\"Into The Wild,\\" Sean Penn took direct aim at the riddle of McCandless's individuality, circumstances, and personal reality, and how they shaped the events that lead to his death.  The movie places its emphasis on the person (vs. the mystery of how he died, the exact details of which we will never know), and I found this a very worthy approach.  Perhaps the McCandless family, after more than a decade had passed, was more comfortable sharing details about Chris's home life making it easier for Penn to explore their influence more deeply.<br /><br />Unlike the less enthusiastic reviewers, I found the exploration into McCandless's personality to be absolutely facinating.  By nature, I am a saver of money; a conserver of personal resources.  I'm a person who is always thinking about my way out of a situation, ready with a plan \\"B.\\" So I was facinated by McCandless, for whom practical concerns like this were irritating distractions.<br /><br />He was a benevolent soul by any measure.  In lieu of feeding his body, he fed on life experience and challenge.  Was McCandless lonely throughout his journey?  We don't know until near the end.  Tragically, the little voices whispering warnings about risks and self-preservation inside his head, were inaudible to Chris McCandless.<br /><br />Was he looking for freedom and adventure?  Or safety, understanding, and love - in a world in which he did not belong?<br /><br />The highlights for me were the balanced screenplay taking the high road on all these issues, and the wonderful cast from top to bottom (particularly the Hal Holbrook performance - You start off wondering why such a small part could be Oscar nomination-worthy, then you watch it, and it breaks your heart, and you understand.)<br /><br />I wonder if someone will (has it been done yet?) make a movie about Krakauer's book about Mt.

B0011HOEY4|4.0|The Ridley Scott mark is evident here simply because of the sprawling landscapes he is known far and wide for in telling the story of real-life crime lord Frank Lucas (Denzel Washington) juxtaposed with the investigation and eventual capture by fictitious investigator Richie Roberts (Russell Crowe).<br /><br />The movie is fast-paced with a sweeping panorama of the period spotted with memorable performances.  That being said, a glaring disappointment was Scott/s inability (refusal?)  to adequately utilize the support of such stalwart actors as Ruby Dee & Chiwetel Ejiofor, both of whom provided substantial support that appeared to have fallen victim to the cutting room floor.<br /><br />An interesting parallel was indeed Frank Lucas and Richie Roberts as they both had enormous similarities, the biggest of which was their devotion to their work which seemed infinitely more important to them than their families.  It is this poor prioritizing that provides the impetus for their actions.  Crowe's character was somewhat more redeemable than Washingtons' whose character indeed had anger management issues which were all supposedly explained away because of societal pressures - blah, blah, blah...<br /><br />It is also interesting that many of Washington's characterizations don't necessarily warrant much attention unless they are somewhat less than socially redeeming.<br /><br />Notwithstanding, it is indeed a good film with flaws like any other (hardly a masterpiece) but well worth becoming a part of your film collection.  I do recommend.
B000ZM1MGE|1.0|Stone won't make himself vulnerable to anyone or the facts, whether that means eliminating all JFK conspiracy theories other than his own or simplifying a story and people as he has done here in Midnight Express. Stone borrowed Billy Hayes' real story of being held in a Turkish prison for several years after being caught smuggling hashish, and hijacked it to devastating effect. [I focus on screenwriter Stone instead of director Parker because the substance of Hayes' original book was altered by Stone and Parker just created Stone's skewed vision]. Stone was successful in destroying the Turkish justice image in the minds of generations of Americans. Ask most any American [now thirty years after Stone made his movie] to picture a Turkish(or Islamic) prison or court room or justice system, and the one portrayed in Midnight Express is the one that is ingrained. Coincidence or not, it should be noted that this humiliating portrayal of Islamic justice came at a time of increased Hollywood output of negative Islamic images and favorable Israeli ones(the unprecedented and universally viewed miniseries Masada). To this day, Islam's portrayal in movies is considered horrendous by those who study it(Shaheen's 'Reel Bad Arabs').     Instead of having ANY sympathetic Muslim/Turkish characters, they ALL are beasts. It turns out the real Billy Hayes actually made friends with several Turkish inmates but accepting Stone's reality means accepting this truth as a lie. Constantly the Western inmates have more depth,..they play instruments, they sing, they constantly visibly show compassion that the Muslims lack, they even articulate in a courtroom why Western justice culture is superior to Islamic sense of justice. The Muslims in the film are stoic, opportunistic, hypocritical, and, well,..evil. They are portrayed as victims of their own culture, as the judge hangs his head down when Billy is castigating Islamic justice for its lack of mercy, and the judge seems sad when he replies that his hands are tied. There is no reaction or inquisitiveness in the faces of the Turkish prosecutor or the others - the viewer sees them as programmed by their culture. Just so the viewer isn't confused as to the root of what creates such a fiasco of justice, Stone purposefully puts Islamic prayer beads in the hands of reprehensible characters like the Turkish public defender, and makes sure that a mosque is the prominent structure occupying the frame as Billy is driven around the city by policemen. Likewise, he hangs Christian symbols on the victims in the film. The warden never attempted to rape Hayes, as the film depicts, nor did Hayes murder anyone. The raping warden, with his piggish obese kids, is a metaphor for the appetite and stern lack of fidelity/tolerance that Stone seems to want to broadcast about Islam to the viewer. Stone's manufactured murder of the raping warden may have been an effort to implant the idea that the resolution the [mostly Christian] viewers should expect between their culture and the grotesque monster of Islam will take the form of a violent showdown.  The viewer can't help but feel relief at the death of the warden, and then carries away from the movie farmer Stone's seed of predjudice against Islam.    The differences between the book and the film is evidence that Stone possibly used the powerful vehicle of a \\"true story\\" to instigate prejudice against Turks/Muslims. Billy Hayes, now 56 years old and living in LA, recently tried[in the Seattle Post] to correct Stone's portrayal of his book: \\"The message of 'Midnight Express' isn't 'Don't go to Turkey', it's 'Don't be an idiot like I was, and try to smuggle drugs.\\" and, \\"I loved the movie, but I wish they'd shown some good Turks. You don't see a single one in the movie, and there were a lot of them, even in the prison. It created this impression that all Turks are like the people in 'Midnight Express.'\\"

B000WTNCYA|3.0|Don't get me wrong, Melody Gardot has a beautiful voice and is obviously a very talented musician.  But, the album seemed too focused on a central theme.  And, the more I listened to it, the more I realized it sounded remarkably similar to Norah Jones.  While I do enjoy listening to this album, I think Melody has room for improvement.  When she does finally tap into her full potential and unique style, the result will be amazing.
0375842209|5.0|I read a lot of books in this genre, because I come from a German family. Many books like this are not unique and tend to tell the same story. This book, however, is different. This is a very well-written and believable piece of fiction. The characters will stay with you even while you are not reading - i found it hard to put down and very engaging. And most importantly, it was indeed, unique. Zusak is very eloquent and writes beautifully; I really enjoyed this book.
1582701709|1.0|I saw this on Oprah while I was job hunting and I thought it was an interesting idea.  Unfortunately, it's superficial and simplistic and has no real substance.  To say I haven't won the lottery because I'm not living my life as though I already had won is both ridiculous and dangerous.  My common sense prevails and I've kept my job and resisted the urge to buy a condo in Waikiki.  Based on that, according to this book, I will never be filthy rich.  And that's probably a pretty safe bet.
B00006IUL7|5.0|This movie takes all my assumptions about writers and police work and puts these themes together in a manner that coincides with disturbing psychological disorientation. Once the writer starts sucking up as much danger as he can make contact with, the plot is twisted enough to make all the confusion expected instead of surprising, but if you pay attention, you can twist in the wind right along with it.
B0015HS5TA|5.0|Welcome to a world of lavish delights. A world filled with fashion shows, cocktail parties, and the latest gossip. This is the world Miss Pettigrew finds her self swept up into, and where she lives her day...to the fullest.       Miss Pettigrew (Frances McDormand) is a nanny that has just been dropped by her placement agency after being fired for the third time from another displeased client. In her desperation for employment she steals an address card to a new client, and is soon on their doorstep, posing as the new nanny from the agency. This new client turns out to be, Delysia Lafosse (Amy Adams), a young singer/actress wannabe who is competing for the lead in a big production play. She has no children and wants a nanny more as a secretary or \\"social secretary\\" as she later calls Miss Pettigrew. Within a matter of minutes of her arrival Miss Pettigrew helps Delysia outwit two of the three men she is seeing, avoiding a possible catastrophe. This makes Delysia worship Miss Pettigrew and before long she is whisking her away to a fashion show and salon before a cocktail party in the evening.       As the characters play with love like a fine chess game, Miss Pettigrew helps Delysia maneuver through this dazzling champagne 'n' strawberry-drenched world of revelries that the rich use in a desperate attempt to conceal the looming dread of WWII, meanwhile enjoying tidbits of luxuries she would never have dreamed of.      Miss Pettigrew Lives for a Day is an absolute delight to watch from the very beginning up until the final end. The production, directing, writing, and acting are all superb as they recreate the WWII era in England.      The acting, well Frances McDormand and Amy Adams as the two leads, need I say more. These two actresses work together so flawlessly. Frances McDormand masters a British accent and gives a performance of layers. Few actresses can play a character that \\"acts\\" fakily-sweet and still give such a realistic performance as Amy Adams. Her performance reminded me of her recent golden-globe nominated performance in Enchanted.      Overall this is a charming, delightfully entertaining film with wonderful performances and a sharp script.   (10/10)
B0012QE4QC|4.0|I saw this one in the theater.  It seems to be getting some mediocre reviews, but I thoroughly enjoyed it. Obviously, there is some historical fact.  As most of us know, Ann lost her head over love.  How much of the rest is accurate?  I have no idea.  This is a story about the Boleyn family, King Henry VIII, and surrounding people.  It is not about war or anything else.  It includes: deception, lies, and the goals of achieving power and wealth by using people.  There are also 3 violent scenes that I had to hide my face from (but I am a wee bit sensitive).  Still, I very much enjoyed the movie and thought the parts were well played. I heard someone call it a \\"chick-flick,\\" but I did not see that as accurate. Natalie Portman (from one of the Star Wars movies, as Luke & Leia's mother--and other movies) did a great job as Ann Boleyn.<br /><br />The story begins with the 3 Boleyn children playing on the grounds of the family's huge English estate, while the father plots of whom he might marry his daughter(s) off to, to secure wealth or power.  Next thing you know, the children are all grown up.  Ann is the eldest.  She has a sister, Mary and a brother.  Ann is a pretty girl.  She is also very independent and with a fiery disposition.  Mary is more plain in appearance, a simple quiet soul.  Mary marries a simple young man and they hope to live a quiet life in a small village somewhere.  Mary and her husband have no interest in the English Court.  Then things change.<br /><br />The Duke of Norfolk, in the best interests of King Henry VIII of England, decides to help the king out.  The Duke is also uncle to the Boleyn children.  The Queen has born a daughter and had still-borns trying to bear the king a son.  The king and queen are barely speaking at this point, so the well-meaning Duke decides the king needs a girlfriend, who could maybe bear him a son while she's at it.  The Uncle and the Boleyn father try to set up the king with Ann, promising her that when the King is done with her, she will be set up with a nice Duke or Earl (maybe the Duke of Earl :-)  Then the Boleyn family would be set for life. (Those English estates were often inherited and cost money to maintain.)<br /><br />Well, as luck would have it, Ann is all ready to enjoy the pleasures of the King's generosity, when the King does a flip and takes an interest in Mary, because of her good nature, honest, kindness, etc. (and Mary is pretty too--just more plain than Ann.)  This causes a bit of tension between the girls as the whole Boleyn family moves to Court to, again, enjoy the generosity of the King.<br /><br />I don't want to tell you any more because then you will know everything I know.  Most of you already know what happens to Ann and that is where the movie ends, but I found all the stuff in between pretty interesting.  I wanted to get up from my seat for a couple of minutes but could not walk away.  By the way, Queen Elizabeth was the daughter of Ann and Henry.<br /><br />How about the Boleyn father.  Nice guy, huh?  \\"Take my daughter and just set me up financially.\\"<br /><br />Just a side note, but I would not recommend this for your children.  Children sometimes see things that invoke fear, project the fears onto people they know, and have fear, nightmares and bad feelings for years.she will be set up with a nice Duke or Earl (maybe the Duke of Earl :-)  Then the Boleyn family would be set for life.

0345479092|5.0|This is a great book for parents who want a well-balanced, middle-of-the-road approach to parenting, without the extremes of BabyWise or Sears.  I started my son on the EASY routine the day he came home from the hospital.  It sometimes took 45 minutes to wake him awake after each daytime feeding, time I could've been napping myself, but the benefits quickly paid off.  My son was sleeping five hours at night at one week, six hours at night at two weeks, eight hours at four weeks, and twelve hours at twelve weeks!  He has a spirited, high-strung personality and the days we get off the routine he is irritable all day and won't sleep at night--he's definitely not naturally a \\"good sleeper\\" so I know our success is something he learned and wasn't born with.  Tracy's other advice for preparing for baby, caring for a newborn, learning baby's cues, swaddling, diapering, feeding, respecting your baby, and everything in between make this book a must-have for every new parent!
B000YABYLA|5.0|I saw this one in the theater, quite by accident.  I took my 15-year old granddaughter to the movies and she said, \\"Let's see Juno.  I heard it was really good.\\"  I had no idea what it was about.  As the movie started, a 16-year old girl was talking about how she had had sex in a chair with this boy and I though, \\"Oh my God!  What have I done!\\"  Well, the movie was quite good, indeed.<br /><br />I believe Juno had sex one time with this boy from school who was about the same age, and, as we all know is quite possible, she got pregnant.  The movie takes you through the whole pregnancy:  how Juno's life changed throughout the pregnancy, decisions she had to make, how she told her parents, should they get married, should she have an abortion, should she keep the baby, should she put it up for adoption? and so many other related issues.  The movie delt with a very serious subject matter, but it did it well and in a non-judgemental way.  There was quite a bit of humor in the movie, but the humor did not diminish the seriousness of the subject.<br /><br />I was really surprised at how good this movie was.  The theater was loaded with teenagers, some with their boyfriends.  I like to hope that they all got a better appreciation of the responsibilities that come with sex from the movie that teens are not necessarily ready for.  Judging from the audience's reactions, I think it made them all think.  No one left making goofy remarks and laughing.  The show seemed to be attempting to show you the whole picture (like the domino principle) of all the people affected and how.  It did not seem to be condemning anyone either.  It was more like \\"OK.  I made a mistake.  I accept the consequences.  Now, my options are: x, y. z.\\"<br /><br />And, yes, both my 15-year old granddaughter and her 59-year old grandmother enjoyed it very much.<br /><br />If you are trying to decide if you children should watch it:<br />1) They probably know WAY more already than you think they do;<br />2) They may have done some exploring already; and<br />3) This movie might give them a better perspective because it seems to speak their language.dy; and  3) This movie might give them a better perspective because it seems to speak their language.
B000O178BY|4.0|I don't remember how I found the hype-- all the hidden web pages providing the background for \\"year zero\\". (check wikipedia if you haven't read them).  It all fit in with my nihilistic side-- drugging the masses, giving military forces antidotes for the pacifying drugs (and more...)  The album itself is a bit of a letdown from the world that was built around it, but I still enjoyed it.  \\"Hyperpower\\" hearkens back to the last part of \\"waiting for the worms\\" by Pink Floyd.  \\"Good solider\\" reminds me of \\"Downward spiral\\" and \\"even deeper\\"-- the innocent \\"bonging\\" tones at the end just add to the creepiness.  All we need is a chorus of children...  \\"vessel\\" reminds me for no apparent reason of \\"big man with a gun\\", except this is consensual... or at least was at first.  \\"I let you put it in my mouth...\\" indeed.  \\"me, I'm not\\" reminds me of \\"where is everybody\\"-- but more trippy.  Sort of a bookend for it.  Certainly a disconcerting portrait of not knowing our own motives... Anyone who has had experience with dealing with things bigger than themselves and having their minds play tricks on them afterward will identify.  The rest... eh.  I can listen to \\"fragile\\" again.  The songs I mentioned are reason enough to buy the album.  If you don't have fragile or downward spiral, I'd get them first.

B000W4KT6E|4.0|Some people don't like the long civil rights march that comes two thirds of the way through the movie, with Queen Latifah singing the powerful song about she knows where she's going and she knows where's been.  I like it just fine, but its staging and arrangement sure reminds me of \\"Walk Through the Fire\\" from the \\"Once More with Feeling\\" episode of BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER.  To my surprise I find the same choreographer responsible for both.  In this case, the original had that little bit of unexpected edge, but here the subject of the civil rights struggle in Baltimore has the weight of gravitas and history behind it, so I guess it's a draw.  If the same slow-moving, lurching camera and candlelight shows up in Adam Shankman's next picture, though, that will be the true test of the auteur theory and you read it here first.<br /><br />It's true that none of the young people of HAIRSPRAY are as likeable as those in the original John Waters movie, here they all seem to be trying too hard, and just as mystifying is why they decided to cast two young actresses who look so much alike, as Tracy's best friend Penny and worst enemy Amber von Tussle.  We decided it was because they were trying to ignite a Freudian interpretation in which Penny and Amber are revealed as two sides of the same coin: mother, whore, and crone all mixed together, so that Tracy would not know whom she was confiding in.  She doesn't really seem to care anyhow, as placed by Nikki Blonsky she's as blithe and oblivious as though she were still slinging ice cream down at the Cold Stone Creamery in Great Neck.  But she's great despite this peculiarity of interpretation, and even if her Tracy Turnblad never seems to feel bad about racism or segregation, at least she gets up and  does something about it.
1416500286|5.0|Unlike the previous reviewer, I greatly enjoyed this book.  It's actually my favorite of Jane Austen's novels.  Emma, to be sure, is a little frivolous and silly, but she's meant to be, as the book shows how she goes from hapless matchmaker to happily matched herself.  The book is at times laugh-out-loud funny, and gives charming insight into life during that time period.  Poor Harriet is a very amusing character, and Emma's father is a hoot.  The many misunderstandings and romantic confusions only add to the story.  Give Emma a chance...you won't be disappointed!
B0015HS5TA|4.0|After she is dismissed from her latest nanny assignment, Miss Pettigrew (Frances McDormand) learns that her employment agency no longer has any jobs for her. Desperate, she steals a position from someone else to work for Delysia Lafosse (Amy Adams). Miss Pettigrew quickly learns that what Delysia needs is not a nanny, but a social secretary. Delysia's life is, as she describes it, complicated. An unsuccessful aspiring actress, Delysia is literally attempting to sleep her way to the top. She is currently balancing three lovers: Nick (Mark Strong), a controlling nightclub owner whose apartment she is staying in, Phil (Tom Payne), the son of a producer whose casting a new play that Delysia plans to get the lead role in, and Michael (Pushing Daisie's Lee Pace) a poor pianist who is the only one who loves Delysia for who she really is. During the course of a very busy day, Miss Pettigrew and Delysia both change and grow. With the help of Miss Pettigrew, Delysia helps discover what is truly important to her--wealth and fame or love--and Miss Pettigrew finds a hidden strength and discovers a love of her own in the form of lingerie designer Joe, who appreciates Miss Pettigrew's honesty and common sense.<br /><br />This film is both a screwball comedy and a fairy tale. Like Delysia herself, it is generally light and frothy, but there are brief moments of greater seriousness. One particularly notable instance of this is when British bombers fly overhead during a lavish party, hinting at the fast approaching horrors of WWII. Most of the party guests shake it off and return to their previous gaiety; only Miss Pettigrew and Joe, who both remember the bloody First World War, remain somber. It is a good way for the movie to remind the audience of the time it is set in without beating them over the head with it.<br /><br />The casting of MISS PETTIGREW LIVES FOR A DAY is quite impressive. Frances McDormand is perfect as the initially austere Miss Pettigrew who is transformed into a more poised individual through the course of the day. Amy Adams is the real find, as she turns the potentially unlikeable Delysia--who is fickle, scheming and greedy--into a sympathetic character. Her Delysia may be an ambitious social climber, but she is also an unhappy young woman who has spent so much time and energy pursuing her dream of being a star that she has lost sight of what is really important. Adams allows Delysia's sweetness and vulnerability to shine through her ditzy exterior. Her most touching scene is when she sings \\"If I Didn't Care\\" at the nightclub where she works while her true love Michael accompanies her on the piano. You can see her heart breaking as she sings about how \\"If I didn't care more than words can say/If I didn't care would I feel this way?...And would I be sure that this is love beyond compare?/Would all this be true if I didn't care for you?\\" She is obviously singing about Michael and about how much she loves him and she cries as she realizes she's choosing pursuit of fame over a life with him. And then as soon as the song ends she snaps back to her Delysia LaFosse persona, all bright smiles and fake cheer. It's a delicate balance, and Amy Adams plays it beautifully. Finally, Lee Pace, so endearing on Pushing Daisies, is equally charming as the penniless Michael.<br /><br />Overall, I enjoyed this film and it was a nice way to spend an hour and a half. However, it wasn't a perfect movie. It was a little silly that so much happened in a single day (entire lives transformed in 24 hours!), and the pacing wasn't as deft as it could have been (sometimes a tad slow and sometimes rushing full speed ahead). My only other complaint is that a bit more backstory would have been nice (how long had Delysia and Michael known each other? How did Delysia, an American, end up in London?, etc.). More backstory wasn't necessary--the story made sense as is and I still got a good sense of the characters with the information they gave out--but it could have made the film richer. Breezy, fun and touching movie; recommended for those who love romance, comedy and a generally good time.lm richer.

B000YABYLA|3.0|Most people -- and obviously many Academy members -- seemed to find this movie utterly precious, yet I found it more than a bit irritating at numerous points. It continually broadcasts its cleverness in thoroughly unrealistic albeit often witty dialogue. The first 15 minutes are nearly unbearable.<br /><br />Fortunately, the film eventually dials back Juno's ironic pop culture references and focuses more on character. I found Ellen Page immensely appealing in the title role, and I enjoyed Juno's parents (delightfully played by Allison Janney and J.K. Simmons) as well as the couple that hopes to adopt her baby (Jennifer Garner and Jason Bateman), but this enjoyment was undercut by insertions like the classmate who confronts Juno at the abortion clinic, spouting bizarre lines from a bad Hal Hartley film.<br /><br />I never got over the forced quirkiness and self-conscious attempts at verbal wit; they brought to mind a student project. I did, however, succumb to the entertaining secondary characters and the twists and turns of the plot. I wanted to know how it would turn out, and of course things are resolved to nearly everyone's satisfaction.<br /><br />A good movie, but on the whole, rather overrated. It should not have been given consideration for the Best Picture Oscar.
6305922756|5.0|Outrageous, wild and intense fun. The best comedy i own is also the best mockumentary and the best \\"cult\\" classic in my collection, all in one. My devotion for this masterpiece is so great, that i can't help to rejoice in every view, over the misadventures of the intellectually challenged, charming, goofy and charismatic members of the Cult British heavy metal band, legendary \\"Spinal Tap\\". Actually, and i don't know why, it gets funnier after every show. Amazing! After years of intense exposure to this movie, my emotions still run faster and higher than ever.<br /><br />In 1982, TV commercial director Marty Dibergi (Director Rob Reiner) is filming the first U.S. tour in years of the cult band Spinal Tap, featuring David St Hubbins (Michael Mc Kean)in guitar, Nigel Tufnel (Christopher Guest) also in guitar, and Derek Smalls (Harry Shearer) on bass guitar, for the promotion of their new album \\"Smell the glove\\". Witness the most goofy and entertaining way in wich a tour goes down, when all possible things that can go wrong, got worst. Please watch the interviews with their stories and \\"insightful\\" opinions, their history (From a R&B skiffle band to psychedelic hippies), the discography (\\"intravenous de Milo\\", \\"Shark Sandwich\\"), the disastrous live performances, the song lyrics and music, the problems with their neurotic manager Ian Faith (Tony Henpra), David's girlfriend tryin to take over the band, and the outrageous issues with publicity and disc Company (promotions and the new LP cover). The most amazing thing, the cast actually composed and recorded the soundtrack on studio, so they actually \\"rock\\" their instruments. Check the early 80's aesthetics in heavy metal, the costumes, the stage designs, the music and lyrics! Totally absent minded and sexualy liberated!<br /><br />This is a non stop \\"trip\\" over a decaying, going-nowhere group of misfits, and we can laugh with the band and at the band. This improvised free style circus got all the elements to crack your jaw out of pure laughter. Elegant, well balanced and masterful conception, and definetly not a fart or pie-in-face comedy, the ultimate mockumentary rocked even the heavy metal world, wich at first thought the band existed (!). The most hylarious experience of my life without a doubt, came out of the absurdities of the world of the music industry, the stage rehearsals, the backstage and the lockers room of a traveling band going down the drain. What a masterpiece, what a concept, such originality and genious all over the place and in every single aspect. Flawless, this is a 5 star Icon in film history, and beyond any known 80's or 90's comedy untill today. Only Coen brothers \\"Raising Arizona\\" could pull me out of these hypnotic sequences of hilarious disasters. Rob reiner's (the princess bride, stand by me, when harry met sally) best work, absolutely genious, high artistic quality gem.<br /><br />The MGM 2000 DVD edition, wich i own, may not be perfect in sound and picture quality, but is THE edition: All the available possible material about Spinal Tap is included, Over an hour of deleted scenes enough to make another paralel movie, Tv spots, interviews, gags, music videos... 80 % of the actual DVD disc capacity is used on extras! What can i say!<br /><br />The DVD menu presentation is Hilarious with the reunited cast playing the band's characters, and the cast and director commentaries based on the same are simply a bonus comedy of its own, simply out of this world, incredible. What a movie, what an edition!<br /><br />I LOVE THIS MOVIE!  ROCK AND ROOOOOOOOOOOLL!!!!!ughter.

B000VDDDY6|4.0|I was pleased with these DVDs - the clarity of the picture, and updated special effects, made for an enjoyable viewing experience.  While there is something to be said for retaining \\"classic\\" shows in their original form, cleaning up the effects puts these series on a par with contemporary series, and perhaps helps them to appeal to a whole new generation.  I look forward to seeing seasons 2 & 3 in this format as well.
B000YXMMAO|3.0|The comments made by the other reviewer ring true with my copy of this record too. First off, there are a number of scuffs and blemishes on the album that suggest poor handling by whoever put the record together. The volume and clarity is noticeably less than any other vinyl album I've played on my table so far, and the production sounds really dense and muddled. I must admit I'm relieved to hear that I'm not the only one that's gotten a \\"dud\\" copy and that that is the way that they all are, because I was about to send it back and reorder it. The album itself is unsurprisingly great, being a Radiohead release as it is, but TBD did a shoddy job pressing it. I'm going to hold onto it as a collector, and hopefully it gets reissued by a company with more attention to auditory detail.

0307388840|3.0|Young Briony, with an overactive fantasy and novelist soul, witnesses the flirtation between her sister, Celia, and the son of a servant, Robbie. When her cousin is raped, Briony accuses Robbie, which sends him to prison. During WWII, Celia--who has left the family--and Briony--guilt ridden by her crime--become nurses while Robbie fights in France. The book has a very lovely Virginia Wolf style to it (which I recognized before the book told me so), with the stream of consciousness, emotions, and perceptions of the characters flowing together during the momentous days. The meta-book stuff (Briony writing the book and changing the events to suit her imagination and forgive her crime) isn't as grating as I usually find that sort of thing. No, my main complaint is just how utterly boring the book is. The story is fascinating and full of potential. But it takes forever to tell. In the words of Briony's rejection letter, \\"it has no backbone\\".  Grade: B-
B0002HYFEI|5.0|I just bought this for my four and half-year old son and he loves it. The corner pieces don't work as easily as one would like though. If you put something heavy on them to hold them down (we used blocks from a different set) they will work. The most fun thing so far has been putting them in a long line of hills. One thing we discovered is that much bigger and heavier marbles (that don't come with the set) work really well too when you line up the ramps and don't have any corners. My son really likes this a lot, although I still think Frigits Deluxe is the best marble toy out there.
0425129608|4.0|(part of the Lost Literary Reference Marathon) Agatha Christie is always good for a character-driven murder mystery. Sure, it's all the typical stuff: a lone hotel on the sea, a dead body strangled on the beach. But it's the characters and psychology--especially of the sleuth Hercule Poirot--that sets her apart. Arlena Marshall is a rich, pretty woman that attracts the scorn of women and the attention of all the men--except her husband. She is found strangled, and her stepdaughter's room contains relics of witchcraft. The setting and the theme of evil and its definition, as well as the mysterious characters, make it perfect for a Lost reference. Grade: B+

This pure expression of consciousness through Eckhart Tolle is a powerful, clear and timely reminder of human potential.   In keeping with Walsch's 'Conversations with God' series and Harrison's 'We are all one' this is definitely in my top ten. All such books have the ability to move you deeply,to heal and awaken, to transcend the normal settings of the mind, releasing you to a newer dimension of your own existence. Highly recommended.

B000002J0P|5.0|Crosby, Stills & Nash (1969) is the classic debut album from one of rock n' roll's first supergroups. David Crosby (The Byrds), Stephen Stills (Buffalo Springfield), and Graham Nash (The Hollies) recorded this, their first album, for Atlantic Records after failing an audition for The Beatles' Apple Records (What?!?!). The most distinctive features of CSN's sound are their wonderful vocals harmonies and the use of acoustic guitars in their song arrangements.<br /><br />The album opens with the quickness of Stephen Stills' crisp acoustic guitar sound in Suite: Judy Blue Eyes, a song Stills wrote about the end of his relationship with former girlfriend, singer Judy Collins. The song is an extraordinary mix of sad desperation, beautiful harmonies and vigorous six-string acoustics.<br /><br />Marrakesh Express is Graham Nash's bouncy tune about a travel route that hippies used in the 1960s (it was notorious for being used to transport the famed Moroccan hashish). Nash even references pot in the song with the line, \\"Don't forget the roaches\\".<br /><br />The first two songs on the album were also hit singles for the group.<br /><br />David Crosby's Guinnevere is one of the best songs here, and one of the most intriguing songs that CSN has ever done. An alternate tuning on David's acoustic guitar, quiet harmonies, and lyrics that describe a ghostly medievil maiden give the song a strange and subtle aura of sad beauty.<br /><br /> Wooden Ships is a David Crosby/Stephen Stills/Paul Kantner (Jefferson Airplane) collaboration, and a rocking electric guitar and organ filled song of war and the apocalypse. David and Stephen share co-lead vocals on the song.<br /><br />I also like Stephen Stills' acoustic Helplessly Hoping, a song about longing for love and how fear keeps people from finding it.<br /><br />Stand by the stairway<br />You'll see something<br />Certain to tell you<br />Confusion has it's cost<br />Love isn't lying<br />It's loose in a lady<br />Who lingers<br />Saying she is lost<br />And choking<br />...on hello<br /><br />The group's harmonies work magic on that one, too. Long Time Gone rocks with electric guitars and a bluesy vocal performance from David Crosby.<br /><br />Crosby, Stills & Nash is a classic album, and a piece of rock n' roll history, really. It's acoustic guitar crispness, pristine vocal harmonies and 1960s hippie relevance make it sort of a monument to the movement of peace and love in that tumultuous era. And, oh yeah! There are some great songs on Crosby, Stills & Nash, too!on that one, too. Long Time Gone rocks with electric guitars and a bluesy vocal performance from David Crosby.

B000WQWPKA|3.0|There's absolutely not a thing wrong with this movie if you are into feel good cliches.In that respect this is a much better movie than 'War of the Worlds' where Spielberg tries to avoid the genre cliches. Seeing the huge alien spacecraft creating their own mini weather systems was pretty cool even though the science behind such huge spacecraft is unfathomable and imposiible. If we are ever to be attacked from space it will most likely be tiny robots in nano spacecraft nurturing their species'DNA,or the alien equivalent of DNA. Physics,space and time render what you see on this screen quite impossible. To travel thousands of light years in machines like you see in Independence Day would require millions of years assuming you could build such monstrosities in the first place. The original craft was 1/4 the size of our moon. How do you build something like that? Perhaps by hollowing out a huge asteroid or the moon of another planet and then manipulating the orbit of a comet to break the spacecraft free from it's orbit. Or you could use Hollywood's trump card when it comes to science fiction; a mysterious technology that is simply beyond our comprehension. Somehow these aliens have developed warp speed technology and yet Jeff Goldblum can disable their defenses with a simple computer virus so earthlings can win the day and return to bureaucratic corruption as usual. If anything as big as what you saw in this movie was approaching the earth bypassing the moon it would result in the second biggest catayclism in earth's history and sterilize the planet of all life, even bacteria. For that we should be grateful because most animals,plants and bacteria deserve a better fate. As far as Mega- Hollywood movies go, this one leaves no cliches unturned and if you can go with it will make you feel good. Please check your brain at the door first however.
0780020685|5.0|If you're one of those people who loves classic movies, foreign or otherwise, or even if you are just a lover of great movies or a student of the arts, you owe it to yourself to see this film at least once. Why? That's more a book than a review... but here goes.<br /><br />In this world there are talents, and there are geniuses. Countless films are produced by talents, but great works of art are produced by geniuses. The films of people like John Ford and Frank Capra are extraordinary not just because of their genius though. They are extraordinary because of their humanity, the way that they tell the story of human beings and the world that they live in, the tragedies and triumphs of normal people in extraordinary circumstances, the epic stories that make up real history and the soul of every human being. Kurosawa's movies are like that. They reflect the same genius of people like Ford and Capra. They are very human stories.<br /><br />I have seen many Kurosawa films over the years, but in my mind this is undoubtedly his greatest film. It is an epic story about a much loved period of Japanese history, a brief period equivalent to the Wild West, when Samurai roamed the streets with no master like so many wandering gunfighters. In fact, this story is the basis of the well-known western The Magnificent Seven.<br /><br />But the story is not about the Samurai so much as it is about how they relate and must cooperate with the villagers they are hired to protect. Across three and a half hours you are introduced to the villagers in a truly desperate situation, and watch as they lament their plight, seek the help of the samurai, and then repeated mistrust them by hiding their possessions and women from them. The samurai who expect to be heroes after a fashion find themselves seemingly unwelcomed and feared by the peasants who not only feared them, but have killed their kind in the past as they came through the town.<br /><br />And when the actual conflicts begin it's not enough just to fight samurai vs. bandits, the samurai actually have to build fortifications and arm the villagers for a long series of engagments. And as the bandits are killed one by one it becomes not a battle, but a war of attrition to see who will last longer. There are many losses along the way, and the ultimate victory leaves you with not a feeling of triumph, but of the real sense of loss that battle can give.<br /><br />There are extraordinary performances all around, from the stereotypical charicatures that are the villagers to the extraordinary personalities of the samurai which range from a wize old man to a crazed eccentric buffoon (played brilliantly by Toshiro Mifune), from a perfectionist swordsman to a young nobleman determined to become a hero somehow. There are numerous scenes which could be a film unto themselves, from the old man rescuing a kidnapped child to the young nobleman's first romantic encounter among the cherry blossoms. And the battle scenes are better than anything Ridley Scott or Wolfgang Peterson (with all due respect) ever put to film, with every sword slash meaning instant death and a final epic showdown in the muddy rain that hs to be some of the most amazing footage ever filmed.<br /><br />If you like historical samurai films, you can't go wrong with Kurosawa. And if you like Kurosawa, it doesn't get an better than this film. You simply have to have the patience to get through the arduous experience that it is, and give the film time to get going (I'd say at least an hour). Of course you can always watch it in pieces, and it holds up remarkably well watched that way (thanks to the way so many segments hold up on their own like seperate short films.<br /><br />Gorgeous black and white cinematography, splendid acting, fantastic plot and dialog (even translated from Japanese). The film may be somewhat poor quality just because of it's age, and recording equipment when the film was made isn't what it is today obviously, but if you askme, you'd have to be just plain crazy to let age or subtitles keep you from seeing this classic. Everyone should see this film at least once. Film lovers of all ages should buy it and cherish it forever.<br /><br />Update June 11, 2013:<br /><br />I have upgraded from the DVD to the Blu Ray and I must say, the difference is AMAZING. The sound, formerly very muddy and degraded, is now much, much clearer. The picture, formerly washed out and pixelated, is now sharp and detailed. And the contrast is so improved it's like night and day. This is how the picture should have looked on the original DVD. In addition, the dialog has been re-translated. The new subtitles are in my opinion less subtle and more clear (more Americanized if you will) to make the plot of the movie easier to understand. In all honesty if you are any kind of fan of this movie or Kurosawa in general, and you own a Blu Ray player you have to have this blu ray. It's expensive, but it's worth it. Gorgeous restoration. The film has fine grain and far less degradation than the previous release, and literally probably looks better than it did in the theater.me, you'd have to be just plain crazy to let age or subtitles keep you from seeing this classic.

B000094PYG|5.0|One of the greatest albums ever.  This isn't an album that you want to play to songs on and skip the rest, this is an album you listen to from start to finish every time.  This is a must have corner stone to any great music collection.
B0011ZNAIC|5.0|Bee Movie was GREAT. I laughed loudly next to my husband who was crying out loud from laughing. The little jokes were really funny, the inside of the hive was wonderfully rendered and ingenious. New York was beautiful. The movie was intelligent and FUN.    We smiled and giggled and rocked around in our seats while we laughed loudly. It was really fun and I'm really glad we saw it. I'm going to buy it for all of my nieces and my mom and my friends as presents.    It was great fun. A real kick to picture the actors doing the voices. Chris Rock was great. Renee Zellwegger was fun. Matthew Broderick and Rip Torn were great. We LOVED Jerry Seinfeld.     You're gonna LOVE this film. It was as much fun as Ratatouille.  Thanks so much for making it!
B000VLE3IS|5.0|A remastered greatest hits led zeppelin album has been log overdue, and I'm glad that it is finally here.  Considering this has two cds and a dvd, this is an incredible bargin of a price.  You will listen to this album for weeks straight.
B000089RVR|5.0|I wasn't sure I would like this album having bought it for just one song.<br />Instead it's rarely out of the CD player an I have become a reluctant Dido listener..lol This is a good buy if you like emotive songs that lay the soul bare.  I like the lyric play so the song writing is what does it for me as well as the deep atmostpheric music.
B00004SCS1|4.0|This album was an interesting start to a talented band.  This is noticably different than any other album made by system of a down, but not in a bad way.  The album has a much more raw sound than anything the band has made since.  The raw energy that the album captures as part of what makes it so unique.
B0010ZR160|2.0|Okay my dear friends, this movie probably hurt me a heckuva lot more than it hurt you. My profession of choice for many years has been long-term childcare. Ben Affleck's (\\"Bennifer\\" to you pop culture vultures! LOL!) \\"Gone Baby Gone\\" does involve the abduction of children. Now you may have a clearer understanding of why it affected me the way it did. I have been entrusted with the care of so many children, teens, and preteens over the years that I shudder at the thought of losing one. The lawsuits would surely wreck my finances, probably for the rest of my life.    What can I say about this movie? The acting is, in a word, superb. Most of the actor's names speak for themselves - though special note must be made of Casey Affleck, the less talented of the so-called 'Affleck Boys'. He surprised the stink out of my rear with an award-worthy performance in the title role.    You probably have some vague idea of the story by now: a husband/wife private investigation team are hired by a single mom to find her missing child.  These PIs are way out of their league and get on the nerves of the police as they bumble their way through clues.  Revealing anymore would truly be unfair.  Many twists and turns ensue and I can safely say it will be difficult for you, dear reader, to predict the outcome.    This movie chilled me to my big-boned skeleton - quite a few shady characters turn up and many depressing events occure.  I tried to discuss the movie with a friend - because it IS that kind of movie, it gets ya thinkin'!  But my 'friend' couldn't be bothered, as she was \\"snowed under at work.\\"     Whatever. Suffice it to say she is not my friend any longer.
B00000DWE2|5.0|This is a classic masterpiece.  This amazing rock opera has sounded great decade after decade, and is worth listening to again and again.
B000002J0B|4.0|I was in the music business (hereby to be referred to simply as The Biz) some years ago. I managed a mid-level rock band of some repute. We covered \\"D'Yer M'Ker\\" - at my insistance. Yes, there were some 'divas' in the band. And yes, those individuals were also like, \\"Oh we just can't dare cover Zepplin, it just isn't right!\\"     My foot.    The truth is, a killer song is a killer song. And every night my boys cranked that one out, it brought the house down. Ahhh, to be young and shapely again.     I claim that Lead Zepplin's best album overall is \\"Houses of the Holy\\" because every single song is truly killer. Even \\"The Crunge\\" - or I might go so far as to say ESPECIALLY \\"The Crunge\\" - because it grooves and rocks at the same time and proved that Page, Plant, Jones, and Bonzo had a sense of humor after all.  Some say they were nerdy but I poo-poo that every time. Unite ladies.
B000FL88EE|5.0|This is yet another example of the greatness of AFI.  Throught the years this band his continued to evolve and make great music, and this latest album is no exception.
B000Z6MIQS|5.0|I got this cd for my birthday and I just love it.  They are a great group and I have all their cds.  I just wish they would have concerts in the US of A because I would love to go to one.  Anyone who likes Simple Plan has to get this cd, it is great.
B000RZIGVS|1.0|I'm really disappointed in Paramont for releasing this set in such a crappy box.  I really wanted to see something great for TNG 20, but I was greatly let down.  I've seen this box set in person and can vouch for how crappy the box is made.  I will not buy this until it has been put into a better box that isn't really over priced.  I agree with other posters, I believe that this will be coming to Blu-Ray within a couple of years.  I'll wait for that.    While I love this series, I will refuse to buy this crappy box.
B000VI70WM|5.0|This album may not be your, \\"typical,\\" Duran but it is chock full of everything we have come to love about the band and their influences. It doesn't matter if you like rock, electro, pop, disco, or rap, RCM has everything in its grooves!<br /><br />I found all but the title track to be gems. Even the Andy Hamilton-esque (Simon Willescroft ) saxaphone on, \\"Dirty Great Monster...\\" It's awesome!!<br />The single release, \\"Falling Down,\\" seriously took time to get used to but it grows on you and permanently sticks. \\"Nite-Runner\\" beats all else on this release; It's catchy, sexy, fun...<br /><br />RCM has a lot of energy, a lot of Roxy, a little Ladytron, a lot of Chic and a slew of modern influences. I have found that people would rather Duran maintain a certain sound...and although admittedly I prefer the Duran of 1981, times have definitely changed and in honor of that change, Duran has presented us with, \\"Red Carpet Massacre.\\"<br /><br />RCM really is a brilliant album once your mind is on OPEN.
B0013J559S|4.0|THE BANK JOB is a bit of a throwback to a different kind of crime movie.  In this day and age, most heist movies are super high-tech (THE ITALIAN JOB, any of the OCEAN'S movies) and usually an occasion for big name stars to do a little slumming.  They may be lots of fun, but they are also sleek and modern.  But THE BANK JOB takes place in 1970, and it is a gritty little period piece.    There's no mistaking it for a film actually MADE in 1970.  There's too much graphic sex and nudity, the language is too harsh. Also, star Jason Statham's hair isn't what you'd see in the 70s.  But it feels very specific to its time and is refreshingly low tech.  Jackhammers, shovels, walkie-talkies.  It's in a time WAY before computers on every desk and cell phones in every pocket.  No internet.  No email.  Just rotary dial telephones.  A time before criminals worried about leaving DNA evidence behind.    It's based on or inspired by the true story of the most lucrative bank robbery in British history (some 4 million pounds).  The robbers dug a tunnel underneath a couple of shops and emerged beneath the vault of a branch of Lloyds bank.  They opened all the safety deposit boxes and disappeared with a wide and sundry list of items.  Apparently, many, many of the box owners declined to tell what items were stolen from them, so the filmmakers have created a rather elaborate scheme involving blackmail, homegrown terrorists, prostitution and miscellaneous indiscretions at the highest levels of government to \\"explain\\" why so many folks were too ashamed to admit what they kept stored in the vault.  It's a complex little plot, but it is neatly put together and actually fairly fun to follow.    Jason Statham is the nominal leader of a gang of minor criminals who are lured into going for \\"one big job\\" by Saffron Burrows, a former school chum who grew up and left their low-class neighborhood to become a model.  After a serious brush with the law, she's given a second chance by agreeing to convince her old chums to rob this bank.  Easy pickings, she tells them.  Of course, she has been directed to recover a specific, highly incendiary packet of photos.  Photos that several warring factions want to get, and they'll use just about any means at their disposal to do so.      We've got a wide assortment of bad guys, ranging from simply nasty to murderously insane.  Into this brew our group of eager but mostly incompetent robbers are thrown.  With a mixture of luck, force of will and some innate, brute cleverness, they muddle their ways through.    I don't want to reveal too many specifics of the plot, because the primary fun of this film IS the plot. The characters are loosely drawn...we just get enough on everyone to stereotype them.  The movie is packed with characters, and moves at such a brisk pace that there really isn't time for depth.  There are some super tense scenes when a ham radio operator picks up the conversations between the robbers and their lookout...will the cops figure out which bank is being robbed in time?  There are lots of unusual touches like that throughout the movie.    THE BANK JOB also features Jason Statham's best performance to date.  I realize that might not being saying much.  His prior films, whether good or not, didn't exactly thrive on his subtleties as a performer, but rather on his brute persona and fighting skills.  In this film, I believe he's finally emerged with a credible, engaging performance.   Except for one brief scene at the end, he never is compelled to violence, so he has to rely on his wits and his charm.  Both are on display here, so even if the movie isn't a huge hit, I think Statham might start taking on some more juicy work in the future.      This is an adult caper movie.  As I hinted, it deserves its R rating.  But it sure is a lot of fun, and while it no doubt will be gone soon from the collective memory, it is well worth your time.
B0013FXWVU|4.0|Horton Hears a Who! is a lively film that will entertain the entire family.  One of the film's themes pertains to believing in one's convictions no matter how small or large it may be.  Horton the elephant (Jim Carrey) holds an entire community of Who-ville in the palm of his hand, or in his case, around his trunk.  His trouble begins when he hears sounds coming from a pink colored clover, Horton tells all the animals about his discovery.  And one of those in great disbelief is the kangaroo (Carol Burnett); she does not tolerate the nonsense and hires a vulture-like bird to get rid of Horton's clover.  However, on the flip side, the Mayor of Who-ville (Steve Carell) has a few skeptics of his own.<br /><br />The film focuses on the various dilemmas that Horton and the mayor attempt to resolve.  First, Horton attempts to find a permanent place for Who-ville so that none of the creatures of the jungle may harm it.  Second, the mayor has to decide to hold the annual community fair.  Third, the mayor is also having problems with his goth-like son, JoJo (Jesse McCartney), who has not spoken a word in his life, is going through adolescence, and is somewhat resilient in following in the family business of becoming the next mayor of Who-ville; for those who watched Little Miss Sunshine, his character bears similarities to the boy in that film.<br /><br />Overall, Horton Hears a Who! is filled with fun and excitement.  Directors Jimmy Hayward and Steve Martino and a cast of artists provide an exceptional adaptation and replication to Dr. Seuss's beloved animated tale along with a few other surprises.  Indeed, there are plenty of laughable moments for all to enjoy.
B000AP04KQ|5.0|Have you ever had a case of the Monday blues? I'm having one as I type!<br /><br />Peter (Ron Livingston) gets stuck in traffic, gets told he didn't file his TPS reports correctly by 3 different bosses, and gets hassled by the boss of his office; Bill Lumbergh (Gary Cole).

Decent extras but all in all, this is a funny movie that definitely is for anyone who has experienced the Monday blues and/or enjoys comedies.
0060786523|5.0|This was my second Seth novel. I read it after falling in love with his writing in \\"An Equal Music.\\" The first thing that struck me about these novels was how different they were ... more » from one another, and how amazing it was that Seth was able to show such complete understanding of two such different cultures and time periods. The second is how beautifully Seth can write.     This 1400 page novel was a page-turner, and well worth the time and effort it took to read. I quickly fell in love with the characters and the story. It was my first exposure to Indian history and after finishing it I found myself looking for more. The only Indian author that has begun to impress me as much as Seth is Rohinton Mistry.     Seth is now my favorite author and I reccommend this novel to anyone with an appreciation for fine fiction. Unfortunately, it's size is both its best and worst feature; it scares people off, but once they give it a chance they realize there was not one page too many.
B0000DJZA5|5.0|I'm sure a lot of potential owners of the album are retizent to purchase this one because they already own Let It Be and don't know whether or not to purchase an album with the same tracks (plus Don't Let Me Down and minus Maggie Mae and Dig It). Is it really necessary?    Before hearing this album I had owned Let It Be for a few years and didn't get around listening to it until a friend offerred to lend it to me. I was pleasantly surprised during the listen because after being accustomed to listening to it in a certain way for awhile, the different takes used and the fact that it is stripped of Phil Spector's famed (or infamous, in this case) \\"wall of sound\\" breathe new life into it, and give it a different, more raw feel. Don't get me wrong, I absolutely love the lavish orchestration of the Spectorized version of The Long and Winding Road, but something about hearing Lennon fumble around on the bass gives the song an indefinable charm. Also stripped of ancillary overdubbings is Across the Universe.    It was highly appropriate to ditch Maggie Mae and Dig It (the products of jamming) for Don't Let Me Down. And FYI, the version on this album is not the same cut as the one released as the b-side of Get Back, nor likewise the one released on Past Masters Vol. 2.    I find this to be more coherent than Let It Be because of the very raw feel throughout (which one might say, is what these songs are all about). The track list makes more sense and the different cuts are refreshing (I should mention that on the track Let It Be, the guitar solo is very different, as McCartney felt that the original one was inappropriately raunchy). With that said, I find Naked to be a BETTER album. Let me put it this way, I would take it on a desert island if I could only have one CD (and some means of playing it I hope!).    Note: I am in no way suggesting ditching Let It Be in favor of this. I listen to both regularly because they have different feels, and I feel that this makes me a healthy person ( : While I have your attention, I might as well tell you not to see the blasphemous spawn of pretentious vermin that is the film Across the Universe. Also, if you are a Beatles fan who is accumulating the entire studio recordings, you NEED to get the Sgt. Pepper's mono mix (the one mixed by the Beatles, as opposed to studio engineers) and the Beatles Christmas compilation (each year the fan club members living in Britain received a single track of music/skits; there are seven songs total). [ebay]    That's it, get Naked!

B00104QSOM|5.0|This was a marvelous film. I'd love to give a full critique, but then I'd probably have to watch it again and I'm not sure my stomach can handle it.    First off, I'll have to admit that this is not an entertaining movie. However, I do not believe that was the intent of the film or the purpose of the story. The story outline is loosely based on Upton Sinclair's book Oil!, and (though I've never read Oil!) I believe this movie is along the lines of the way Sinclair thought. If the only reason you watch a movie is to be entertained, then don't watch this film. If you enjoy watching films that expect some amount of introspection (both personally and societally), then watch this film.    I've read some of the negative reviews, and it seems that most of them were expecting an adventure movie. That the music would be inspiring and the story gripping all the way to the pentacle of suspense, and then happily ever after. Well, it's not. At times, the film makes you feel like you are sitting on a lawn chair, out in the middle of nowhere watching some guy dig an oil well. However, the score never let's you get comfortable. Some people have criticized the score, but it's intent is to make you uncomfortable when they want you to. It caused me to have an unsettled feeling for the entire film.    It would do the American people good to be a little more introspective at times. To understand their motives and beliefs. To ask the question 'why?' a little more frequently. I believe this film, when personally analyzed, causes one to question motives for ones own pursuits of wealth and to ask the question 'What will this cost me in the end?'
0143038419|1.0|I have never before felt compelled to write a review about a book, but Eat, Pray, Love is such a divisive book that I feel obligated to weigh in.  Prior to reading it, I had heard people raving about how great it was and looked forward to seeing what all the fuss was about.  Once I realized that her \\"journey\\" was a direct result of her leaving her husband and indulging her own fantasies, I almost put it down.  Only curiosity kept me reading, and I began to enjoy reading about her time in Italy in sort of a superficial way.  It didn't take long, however, for my initial instincts to kick back in.  I struggled to finish the book and could not identify with what I considered to be selfish and irresponsible acts by the author.  I can understand why some people may enjoy this book, but to those who have  been dealt a tougher hand, it seems a little shallow.
0385338724|2.0|I've been a fan of Sophie Kinsella ever since I read her first book and jumped at the chance to read Remember me? because I thought it would be written in her normal style but boy was I disappointed. Not only was there very little to laugh at but worse of all, I thought the characters were very poorly developed. I would say that the worst character development was for Eric, Lexi's husband. Kinsella's treatment of this character made him appear robotic and not realistic at all.
B0000CABBW|5.0|Erica Asahan Wrote:<br /><br />This movie was probably one of the best I have seen in decades! I love the main character. Her determination and courage inspired me. I have watched this movie at least a dozen times since I bought it and I just love it!

B00000DGRX|5.0|When I pulled out my old vinyl LP of Machine Head and noticed that the sound quality was worse than a transistor radio, I knew it was time to look for this remastered edition on CD.  The sound is pretty amazing, like hearing it for the first time.  The intros on \\"Maybe I'm a Leo\\", \\"Never Before\\" and \\"Space Truckin'\\" jump with great clarity and bass, with good punch from the drums as well.  Disc 2 is pretty cool, with some alternate takes that make you feel like you're there in the studio.  Definitely worth a listen.  Extensive liner notes too. One minor detraction from the packaging.  I've never liked the 2-CD jewel cases with the little hinges that crack and break so often.  Getting the second disc out can be somewhat of a pain.  I've never really considered myself a big Deep Purple fan, but this set did it for me.  CRANK IT UP!
B000MRAAJM|5.0|absolutly breath taking. the scenery on these discs is stunning to say the least. BBC did a superb job on the filming of this series. however, if your going to buy, make sure it's in high def.
B000E1ZBGS|5.0|Jane Austen wrote six of the most sparkling novels ever penned and adapting them to the movies is hard because fans of Austen are passionate, literate and critical and can recite whole chunks of dialog from the novels the same way fans of Monty Python can do the lumberjack song.  And Pride and Prejudice is probably her best loved and most frequently dramatized work.<br /><br />This is the best adaption I have seen.  It is true in spirit and in sense to the original. The visual adaption of the novel is done with lyric beauty, gritty attention to detail and an eye for symbolic clues to the properly restrained feelings of the protagonists.  The scene where Elizabeth wanders through the nearly naked statuary of Pemberly is pure genius as if the artwork is showing us her secret attraction for Darcy.  So much fun--such chic chick-lit!
B00006L3S3|5.0|This is a very hot lp - cd you'll love the flow of it Thanks may ping.
B0001CNRSE|3.0|`Honey' is not the greatest movie out there.  It's not even the greatest `dance' movie out there; but who are we kidding, none of us expected that.  Jessica Alba is not the greatest actress out there; she's not even really a `good' one, and she's not the greatest dancer out there either, but she is a good one, and she looks `good' dancing.  That pretty much sums up `Honey'.  Good looking girl dances well.  It doesn't matter that the reasons she's dancing is to help young kids in the neighborhood turn to dance over crime or that she dreams of furthering this cause by opening a dance studio for underprivileged inner-city children.  No, the only thing that matters is the fact that Jessica Alba looks good dancing.  Hey, I'm just stating the facts here.<br /><br />Mind you; I'm not complaining.<br /><br />The film follows young Honey Daniels, a girl who teaches young kids to dance at this worn out clich&eacute; of a dance studio in `the hood'.  She's caught on video dancing in a club and recruited by a music video director to dance in his next video.  Obviously smitten with Honey the girl, not the dancer (since she doesn't dance any better then the other girls in the video) he decides to let her choreograph.  Things are looking up for Honey and soon she may have the means to really do some good for her community (since you know the hottie has to have a heart of gold).<br /><br />Then this great guy who gave her the big break reveals his true intentions and all the good in her life starts spirally downhill.  She's losing the respect of the kids in the community and as a result come of them are turning to a life of crime.  She's losing the bond she had with her best friend because of her new career and with the sudden strain on her working relationship she risks losing the means to buy this great place to house a dance studio.<br /><br />Honey, the condiment (can I call it that), is a great way to make a tasty dessert even more delectable.  If used properly, that syrupy sweet goodness can make any tummy more than happy.  If improper amounts are digested at one time though, one can become sick, to the point of vomiting even.  `Honey', the movie, is similar in that it can provide mindless fun at one moment but then deliver a migraine the next.  I prefer a little depth to my movies (and what this movie presents as `depth' can't really be called that since its delivery is laughable at best).  That isn't to say that there isn't something good to be found here.  If taken in the right doses then films like `Honey' can serve their purpose; they can make the viewer `happy'.

B000JBWWBK|3.0|Ordered the soundtrack and immediately sent it back because many of the really good songs from the movie were omitted.  I'll just have to watch the DVD a lot to enjoy that music, especially when Russell Crowe and Marilyn Cotillard are sitting at the outside cafe watching the movie and listening to the song being sung.  I believe the song is called Boum...not on the soundtrack.  I would rather have had that than Patti Paige.
B000002G7E|5.0|I'm not the type to write reviews, but when I looked at several of the reviews bashing this album, I had to speak up. I own all the studio albums by The Velvet Underground, and this one is by far my favorite. That being said, as you probably already read, it is the least accessible. Don't let that discourage you. Easy come, easy go, right? I recommend starting with another Velvet album if this is your first exposure to them. Come back to this one, and give it some patience; You will be rewarded.
B000JQ2K9O|5.0|This is a true classic.  Through a simile of keeping a motorcycle in tip top shape we learn the lesson of being present in moment and entering the flow of life.  A wonderful book that has been printed over and over.
B0010YSD7M|5.0|This is really one of the best sci-fi movies and series based movies I have seen in a long time. The production quality is great and it shows what the producers of Stargate SG-1 can do when they are not subject to a low budget. I think is the best way for the SG1 saga to graduate to the 2 hour format. I can't wait for the release of Continuum and the return of Jack O'Neill (Richard Dean Anderson). If you are like me and already own the complete DVD collection then this is the best way to top it off.
B00104QSOM|4.0|A story about family, greed, religion, and oil, centered around a turn-of-the-century prospector in the early days of the business.
0525950079|3.0|This is a review for both The Pillars of the Earth and World Without End.    In both books, there's too much sex, too much randomness, to much suffering and misery.    I don't think Ken Follett is a very mature writer. There are some immature phrases, some awkward wording (repetition of characters' names instead of using pronouns). He's not polished. There's too much damn vengeance. It becomes insupportable and silly.    WAY too much sex. It becomes tiresome and distasteful.    And the anachronisms!   Never mind that the f-word was probably not around yet, and if so, then barely. I can say with absolutely certainty that no one used the phrases \\"spill the beans\\" or \\"I'm up to it\\" or \\"splitting up\\" or \\"shag\\" or \\"girlfriend/boyfriend\\".     That last one: are you SERIOUS? When I say the word \\"boyfriend\\", I seriously almost had a heart attack.     And \\"SEXY\\"? You have got to be kidding. NO ONE IN THE TWELFTH OR FOURTEEN CENTURIES EVER USED THE WORD \\"SEXY\\". THE WORD \\"SEXY\\" DID NOT EXIST.    This author has clearly never written historical fiction before Pillars of the Earth, and it shows.   The characters are modern, the wording is modern, the explanations are modern.    In World Without End, Deux-ex-machina pops up up SO MUCH, saving Ralph's worthless life so he can bounce back to rape another woman, kill another man, make more \\"mischief\\", wreck some peasants' lives.     Frankly, these characters are RECYCLED.   Godwyn is just inexplicably evil. Hm. Where have we seen an evil churchman before? Not Bishop Waleran from Pillars of the Earth, surely!?    Philemon, too, fits this mold.    Oh, and, of course, Caris and Merthin, the frustrated and long-suffering lovers, who, because of society, cannot marry and live together. Hmm. Just like Ellen and Tom, perhaps? Or Jack and Aliena?    AND, most glaringly, RALPH, for no particular reason, is just cruel, and is apparently the reincarnation of William Hamleigh. Inconceivably brutal nobleman w hose favourite pastimes include brutal rape, murder, more rape, and some more murder? Clearly.    AND it was annoying that he kept emphasizing that these people were descendants of the former characters.   Okay, then WHY WOULD IT TAKE ANOTHER 200 YEARS TO HAVE JACK'S CARPENTRY SKILLS MANIFEST THEMSELVES IN MERTHIN? OR WILLIAM'S EVIL IN RALPH? OR WALERAN'S EVIL IN GODWYN? OR REGAN'S IN PETRANILLA?    And why, WHY, if your brother was a CONVICTED RAPIST, would you hesitate to give him up, MERTHIN? How the hell could you allow things to go on normally knowing that your brother raped a woman, then hundreds, including nuns, killed nuns, and men and women and children, pillaged and stole, and KILLED HIS OWN WIFE?!!    ALSO, it seems unfair to me that Merthin has how many children by different mothers and Caris has only slept with...um, him?    I understand the brutal, unfair relationship between serf and lord. I'm a history person. I get it. It was exploitation, and was often cruel.    HOW MANY TIMES DO I NEED TO SEE WILLIAM OR GODWYN OR RALPH MESSING UP THESE PEASANTS' LIVES?    HOW MANY TIMES DO I NEED TO HEAR, IN CRUDE DETAIL, HOW WILLIAM/RALPH RAPES YET ANOTHER WOMAN?    How many disappointments and frustrations and mix-ups and plots and complications and vengeful plots must I endure? It 's a brutal manipulation of the reader's feeling.     AND that \\"childhood secret\\" in \\"World Without End\\" really was anti-climactic and not dramatic at all. He barely explained it. In fact, there was almost nothing to it; it explained itself. I guessed it before the whole thing was revealed.     Also, it seemed in World without End that Follett just wanted to get past the 1000 page mark.    This is not the worst book I have ever read. There are more than a few moments of identification/sympathy with the characters, but Follett does the SAME THING in this book as in the last. He makes some evil, evil, evil, evil, character who does so many evi, evil, evil, evil things that it is revolting, but then he keeps him alive so long that by the time he finally is killed in some anti-climactic manner, the reader is just like, \\"Oh, finally. Next?\\" (William, Ralph, Godwyn.)      Okay, yeah, we can understand the corrupt underworkings of the church, etc., and life in the medieval time, but there are some serious flaws. Sigh. Sigh. Sigh.    I disliked this book. At some points I hated it.
B000MRA5NS|5.0|This Blu-Ray's picture is reference quality for your HDTV.    The special features aren't anything great--but the 1080p on the movie is incredible looking.  Better than some of the other BluRay discs that I have.
B00008PC2O|2.0|The product will not allow you to view the HD content unless you live in North America. This is short-sighted by the publishers in my opinon as it closes off markets. Let's face it, it's not as if this is a latest release by any stretch of the imagination. If they're really flogging the last from the terminator dead horse after the terrible terminator 3 then you think they would be after all the customers they could get!!!
B0010YSD7M|5.0|I just got to watch this for the first time tonight, and I must say that I am very impressed. Being a longtime Stargate fan (right back to the original film), I was hoping that this sequel film would stick closely to the series... and it did very nicely.    I found the cinematography to be excellent, with a large number of panoramic special effect sequences that were a nice upgrade from the already-terrific standard set by the show. Joel Goldsmith's score for the film was absolutely fantastic, too. I'm hoping it will be released on CD soon.    I was also glad to find that the film did not go \\"over the top\\" and remained about as family-friendly as the TV series did through the years. I'm already looking forward to the next one!
0452289963|5.0|This book said everything I had already known deep down;truth. It is extremely relevant for today's times. If everyone read it and actually tried to live in the now, the world would be revolutionized. I only hope that more and more people everywhere begin to awaken and live this beautiful life the way we are meant to....truely conscience.
B000002KYK|5.0|I have seen \\"Blade Runner\\" only two time. The first time was on TV about 15 years ago, it impressed me at the time. I ran across this version of the soundtrack about a year ago on cassette no less, and really enjoyed the mood it creates.  I mentioned to a co-worker how much I enjoyed the music from the movie, and he stated he had another official version of the soundtrack.  So, I listened to his version, and I must say I was really disappointed with that version. The voice overs are very distracting and take away from the beauty of the music. Two months ago I went to see the directors cut of the movie, unfortunately the movie did not grab me as much as the first time I saw it, though still an enjoyable film. The music during the film also didn't particulary grab my attention. So, I guess it's just a matter of taste. I also have the soundtrack to \\"Alexander\\" that Vangelis did a few years ago. I recommend the music and movie, though I seem to be the only one who does.
1933492279|5.0|I really enjoyed Cosmic-Motors. As a 2d/3d artist I was inspired by the concepts that Simon created and his use of photography, 3d and 2d apps to bring his work to life.  From scketches to final renders, his work is amazing and inspirational.
B000XGDO04|4.0|I purchased 19 two weeks ago and listened to it everyday. Going through every song on the album I was interested on who actually Adele Atkins was? I first found out about Adele on ITunes as a free single download (Hometown Glory). It convinced me to find and purchase the album so I can check out everything for myself. I must say that this turned out to be way better than I thought.    What really impressed me about Adele is when i found out how young she was. When I heard her voice it was so mature and smooth (something that puts a smile on your face). When I found out she was only 19 I thought back to when i finally saw Teena Marie perform. For the ones who do not know Teena she has a very controlled and powerful voice, sort of like Christina Aguliara, but Teena looked so small (something like 5'3 maybe shorter). But getting back tot he album I just can not get enough of it. I've read the reviews about critics and consumers comparing Adele to Amy Winehouse.    To me the style of music is simular but the actual music and vocals are totally different. Both Artists are original yet still have a smooth Motown feel to them. While Amy has more of a brickhouse jazz feel to it, Adele has a smooth blues feel to the cd. Adele also writes her own music which most tracks are about heartbrake. Also she performs most of her music on the album as well, something that also impressed me. To me it's a must buy for music buyers and I can see this girl going far with her career.

0679736646|5.0|Ubik is a tremendous read. Dick is capable of terrifying the reader in one moment and producing laughter in the next. I have read this book over ten times, never failing to react to the characters, never failing to enjoy it. Of the many utterly brilliant books that Dick had produced this is both brilliant, moving and exciting. It sits easily among his best.
B000WGWQG8|5.0|What can I say. The book is really well know and the man it is written about if less well known. Of Course people think they know him, but truley few people understand the magnitude of his contributions to ideals that we take for granted. HBO did an excellent job of humanizing a great man.
B000UO8BB6|5.0|Takin' Off was Herbie Hancock's first album as a leader, having served as pianist for five previously released sessions with trumpeter Donald Byrd.  All six memorable pieces on this album were composed by Hancock.  His cohorts on the session are Freddie Hubbard (trumpet), Dexter Gordon (tenor sax), Butch Warren (bass), and Billy Higgins (drums).  All the players brought their A-game to the studio, inspired no doubt by the material presented to them.  It's hard to believe this was Hancock's first go round as leader, as the songs are all confident and challenging.<br /><br />\\"Watermelon Man\\" is an exuberant romp given vivid life by the horns of Gordon and Hubbard, as well as the rollicking piano of Hancock.  \\"Three Bags Full\\" and \\"Empty Pockets\\" are strong pieces as well.  \\"The Maze\\" is a brilliant piece of music, mysterious, foreshadowing the direction Hancock would turn on later releases like Empyrean Isles.  \\"Driftin'\\" is in the same mode as \\"Watermelon Man\\", only mellower.  Hubbard is strong here, eschewing the trumpet for a flugelhorn, which better suits the mood of the piece.  The album proper closes with \\"Alone and I\\", an emotional ballad.  The RVG Edition also contains alternate takes of \\"Watermelon Man\\", \\"Three Bags Full\\", and \\"Empty Pockets\\".  As per usual, the remastered sound is excellent.  This is a stellar entry from an artist on his way to becoming a jazz icon.

6304698682|5.0|Let's face it, nearly all Westerns are morality plays about good vs. evil, you know, the \\"good guys\\" verses the \\"bad guys.\\" The challenge for film makers is how to package this morality play in a new, refreshing, and interesting way. Pale Rider succeeds in doing this in several ways. First, the scenery and cinematography are stunning--the American West has spectacular vistas, and this movie takes full advantage (check the credits for site locations, you may want to visit them someday). Secondly, the characters are well developed--you cheer for the good guys and loathe the bad ones.  The mining camp occupants being the good guys are here depicted as clean, decent, moral, family types (though in reality, mining camps were probably full of greedy crooks, gamblers, whoremongers, and drunkards). The bad guys are the greedy, corporate miners led by LaHood and his employees, plus the hired guns he employs to drive out the poor, subsistence mining camp families. Enhanced by elements of answered prayer, love triangles (or in this case, a love quadrangle), coming of age innocence in a young girl, rescue missions, and supernatural overtones, Pale Rider brilliantly weaves together all these elements leading to a spectacular reconing as the Preacher turned gunslinger strikes out to obtain justice for all. \\"Preacher...we all love you Preacher....I love you....Thank you....Goodbye.\\" The ending just about brings tears to your eyes. If only we all had such an advocate in real life.
B000002J09|5.0|This album is one of the greatest ever made by Led Zeppelin. All the songs are memorable and will be always remembered by you. I want to be laconic here: for peole already knowing this album, there is no need to explain how great Stairway to Heaven or The Battle of Evermore are. For those who have never heard about it, definitely try it, there is almost 100% you wil love it and preserve it always in your colection of music. Wonderful!
B000059H98|4.0|Good,campy comedy; Lori Petty is brilliant in fulfilling her roll as Tank Girl. She's a very Gwen Stefani-like persona here, both in her quirky dress and wisecracking personality.  Refusing to submit to the evil powers that be, she not only resists her captors, but effectivly belittles them with her endless supply of one-liners. I couldn't stop laughing; even though she looked like Gwen, she sounded like Groucho Marx with her underhanded wisecracks. (How's that for a combo!) But in the end, we all know she's just a girl. Its all good fun--watch it when you are in a lighter mood.
B000PY52EU|5.0|Brilliant. As brilliant as Tennessee Williams screenplay \\"Babydoll.\\"   What a fine thing to finally see something this good.
1582701709|5.0|I cannot say enough about this book. The premise is simplicity itself. Yet many have not been aware of this incredible life altering secret. It is powerful and accessible. Accessible to anyone willing to accept the ideas and incorporate them into their lives. It has changed my life. One simple statement near the end of the book changed me completely,\\"Remember to remember\\". Whenever I am off track I repeat those 3 words and I am back. Once you read the book you will know what I mean. If you never read another self help book, read \\"The Secret\\".
0143113100|5.0|Absolutely fascinating. Really makes you think.  Not only fascinating information but scinentific tests to backup the information. The breakthrough with stroke patients are amazing. The ability of a person to rewire their brain opens up a vast area exploration. I feel that everyone should read this book.
0802130208|1.0|I had been told what a wonderful and funny book this was.  I found it neither.  I found none of the characters sympathetic and didn't really care what happened to them.  I kept thinking there was a deeper purpose for the book, namely social commentary, but it was a tedious, definitely not funny way to receive the message.    Not worth reading.    Gail Switzer
B0013FDM7E|4.0|I Am Legend<br />101 min<br />Drama/Sci-Fi/Thriller<br />December 14, 2007<br />USA<br />Director: Francis Lawrence<br />Writers: Mark Protosevich (screenplay), Akiva Goldsman (screenplay)<br />Stars: Will Smith, Alice Braga, Charlie Tahan<br /><br />As in the movie \\"The Omega Man\\", don't expect a happy outcome for Neville played by Will Smith.  At least not in the Theatrical Version, the Alternate version has a happier ending. If you enjoyed the version with Charlton Heston you will probably like this version with Will Smith. One thing I have to agree with several reviews here is they should have used real humans for those infected as they did in the first movie. The CGI versions are a bit over the top and don't feel real. CGI is fine as long as it is mainly used for mattes and large creatures, but when you try to make humans with it, it seems almost like watching a cartoon. Only some \\"Resident Evil\\" computer gamers may think they are acceptable. It isn't that I don't like CGI, I thought \\"Beowulf\\" was quite well done. It just didn't work here. Sometimes makeup is far more effective. Personally I would have loved to seen the infected people and animals more realistic, in other words people and dogs with makeup, not CGI. The story premise is somewhat like the book, a virus wipes out mankind. Neville and a few other humans have survived.<br /><br />Neville believes everyone has now changed to the cannibalistic creatures that come out at night. His family is dead but he has a dog as a companion in this \\"I Am Legend\\" version. An interesting twist to how those changed, don't want changed and they are clever enough to even trap Neville. He keeps telling them he can fix this when in fact they don't desire it like he does. His dog is his best friend and probably the last thing that keeps him from going crazy with loneliness. His dog will sacrifice itself to save him inevitably. Neville will sacrifice himself for what is left of mankind as well when the time comes. Most of us would die for someone we love, so keeping that in mind it is a little easier to take the trajedy when it comes. Until then he and his dog hold up at night in his fortress like apartment and come out to scout the city for food, DVDs, and the location of infected colonies during the day. Chasing deer in a Shelby Mustang is one of the few thrills left to him. He must be home by dusk and make sure the Zombies don't follow him if he hopes to survive.<br /><br />I enjoyed the movie and Bob Marley music and I think it has good replayability. Good quality DVD with animated shorts on the basic single disc, and commentarty, interviews, and much more on the two disc version.<br /><br />The Blu-ray version is excellent and has excellent quality picture and sound.

B00027JYLC|5.0|The first I heard of this movie was from Stephen King's book \\"Danse Macabre\\" some years ago. After too long a time, I finally watched it.<br /><br />I was stunned. This is one of the best movies I have ever seen. The writing, scenes, characters, and plot are mind-blowing. Even my 14 year old step-son was enamored with the film. It was brilliant.<br /><br />The characters were charming, humorous, cold, loving, etc.<br /><br />What really hit me was the fact that the movie was not accepted by society and that it was concidered the most 'horrific' movie at the time, which led to it being pulled from the few screens it was playing on. Three decades later - yes, thirty YEARS - the 'freak-out' phase in American society rediscovered the film and it had some success as an underground film.<br /><br />Amazingly, it wasn't until 1994 that the National Film Registry put the film in its archive of cinematic treasures. That's 62 years. A lot of people lived and died durring those years. That is a long time to gain recognition.<br /><br />This gives me hope, however. Just because something isn't appreciated now, doesn't mean it won't be so later. It is an astounding film that people in the 1930's simply didn't understand.<br /><br />After all, who is a freak? What defines one? Is it wrong to look at someone who isn't \\"average\\" or \\"normal\\" in a different light?<br /><br />I would urge anyone who likes good story-telling to see this movie - and the insightful featurette/documentary FREAKS: SIDESHOW CINEMA.<br /><br />Simply amazing stuff.
B0010VD7EO|5.0|I'm the type of person who enjoyed the Digital Ash...album by Bright Eyes, against the word of several other big Bright Eyes fans.  Maybe it was the unique electronic mixing, but something drew me to it.  This album does the same thing for me and I enjoyed it straight from the get-go.  The album sounds like something someone in the 60's would have put out if they had access to the same equipment we have today.  Standout songs are: Kids (Awesome synth beat going on...); Time to pretend (I'm high in a video game feeling); and Electric Feel.  This group has a lot of potential, I can't wait until their next release.
185984054X|1.0|Once again, I read a Christopher Hitchens' book without purchasing it at local bookstore. I am not going to line this man's pockets! I rather give it to the Missionaries of Charity! Nevertheless,the great advantage of every Hitchens book is that each is so short and shallow that one can cruise through them and get over the pain of reading his drivel fairly quickly. Also to his credit, Hitchens' agenda is anything but secret, so I don't have to waste time discovering it: he wants to debunk religion, but particularly, Christianity, by means of an unrelenting attack of ridicule, satire, special pleading, and selective use of evidence. In this instance his target is a figure beloved by all: Mother Theresa of Calcutta. Hitchens leaves no stone upturned which he then picks up and deftly hurls at a woman who gave her life in the service of the poor. Hitchens would rather have had her been a ruthless businesswoman who out of secular passions becomes a humanitarian than a poor, shriveled nun who spent her life in pursuit of a chimera and a lie. Hitchens' book is a banal, gutless, hapless, crass, and despicable attack upon a woman who was her intellectual, moral, and spiritual superior. Hitchens' true achievement inhis books has been that he, singlehandedly, has revived the classical stereotype of the atheist being an amoral, detestable, and intellectually inferior primate. Toss this book into your tinderbox and read instead Dinesh D'Souza's [[ASIN:1596985178 What's So Great About Christianity]] or Fr. Brian Kolodiejchuk's [[ASIN:0385520379 Mother Teresa: Come Be My Light]] and judge for yourself the character of Christianity and Mother Theresa, and toss away the blinders this miser Christopher Hitchens wants to impose on you.
B00110K62U|3.0|I have the previous DVD release of this concert, and I love the music and sound, but the picture quality was a big disappointment: it's quite poor on an HDTV since it's shown in 4:3 standard definition format. I was excited to see this widescreen release, but after reading that the audio is only in stereo, I'm going to have to pass.    I have had the HD broadcast saved onto my DVR for the last two years, and it's sooo much better than the DVD. I long for a Blu-ray edition that will give this magnificent production the visual and audio treatment that it deserves.
B000WS4OZM|5.0|Who would imagine that an ageing Johnny Cash could reach out and cover dark and strange songs like these?  OK, it's uneven, with one or two cuts actually sub-par, but \\"I see a darkness\\" is perfect, \\"One\\"--who could believe anyone could turn this into such a great song?  And then, there is the utterly savage version of \\"Mercy Seat.\\"  Far better than any Nick Cave version, Johnny does it straight and without the histrionics.  It is totally gripping--I was never an anti-death penalty person, or even particularly anti-death, but this song just blows you away.  It's not the killing part that is so powerful, it's the mere fact of death itself, and the consciousness of walking to that chair like a mouse gingerly pushing down the bar on a trap while knowing what is about to happen....<br /><br />And yet the song is unsentimental.  The most important part, and the real hook, is the protagonist going from his \\"tough guy\\" persona in which he sticks by his story, damn your eyes, to, only at the last minute, admitting that he did lie, and that he is guilty.  I find this the most powerful part of the song (and the barroom piano really brings it out in the coda).  I think if it hadn't been for this song, I would have never had the courage to admit, even to myself, that I too had tried to ride on a lie all the way through the judicial system.  All that time I was playing the innocent victim, I wasn't.  I don't know if I deserved what I got, any more than the protagonist deserved to have his brain melted, but the first thing is to start with honesty.<br /><br />That and his version of Wayfaring Stranger--a little bit strained--really spoke to me.  But even the ones that didn't have a personal meaning were generally excellent (\\"Lucky Old Sun,\\" \\"Won't Back Down\\").  A stunning depth and delivery.  Even if you don't like his other stuff, you've got to listen to this.  He can make Neil Diamond (a great song writer but not a tornado of energy as a singer) seem tremendous. [38]

The Ultimate Editions will also include some additional features, listed further below.<br /><br />Dirty Harry Special Edition<br /><br />Dirty Harry is generally regarded as a classic, the beginning of a second larger-than-life persona for Clint Eastwood (after The Man with No Name). It's the source of the famous \\"Do you feel lucky?  Well, do ya, punk?\\"  (The actual quote is \\"... you've got to ask yourself a question: Do I feel lucky? Well, do ya, punk?\\" but the original doesn't quote as well out of context.)<br /><br />Tough cop \\"Dirty\\" Harry Callahan has his own simple, commonsense rules for dealing with crime, based on a strong sense of right and wrong and an impatience with needless details and constraints.  The latter gets him into continual trouble with the system which, as portrayed in the movie, is more about politics and bureaucracy than doing what needs to be done.  This reflected well the frustrations and fears of Americans in the '70s that criminals were taking over the streets and that the law was powerless to stop them because the \\"criminal-coddling\\" courts were holding them back.  I personally value the Fourth Amendment and other such niceties and shiver to think of some of the political and moral ramifications of this movie (some of which are still very much with us), but whatever one's politics, Dirty Harry is very effective as a police-action thriller, largely because of Eastwood's unique persona.  It's hard not to admire and root for him even if you think he's not always right.  There are also the standard gunfights and car chases, and high suspense, all well done.<br /><br />In the films that followed in the series, Harry became a somewhat more balanced, complex or confusing character, depending on your point of view, coming down clearly on the side of the law against rogue vigilante cops, for example, and learning to appreciate a female cop as a partner, but the basic idea of Harry standing strong despite the corrupt, wimpy system remained.<br /><br />I'm pleased to see that some of the new special features in the set deal with the \\"issues\\" raised by the Dirty Harry films.  I look forward to seeing what others make of them.<br /><br />The special features:<br /><br />-- new commentary by filmmaker and Eastwood associate/biographer Richard Schickel<br />-- new featurette \\"The Long Shadow of Dirty Harry,\\" on the influence and legacy of Dirty Harry<br />-- \\"Dirty Harry: The Original,\\" with Clint Eastwood and the film's creators looking back at the creation of the Dirty Harry character<br />-- \\"Dirty Harry's Way,\\" a promotional short focusing on the toughness of the movie's main character<br />-- interview gallery, with Patricia Clarkson, Joel Cox, Clint Eastwood, Hal Holbrook, Evan Kim, John Milius, Ted Post, Andy Robinson, Arnold Schwarzenegger and Robert Urich<br />-- \\"Clint Eastwood: The Man from Malpaso,\\" a 1993 TV program on his life and career, including scenes from his work and interviews with friends, fellow actors and crew members<br />-- trailer gallery: Dirty Harry, Magnum Force, The Enforcer, Sudden Impact and The Dead Pool<br /><br />Magnum Force Deluxe Edition<br /><br />As the sequel to a classic film, it suffers some from the let-downs typical of sequels, but it's still Clint Eastwood being a tough guy, which is enough to carry the merely average plot and script and make it good entertainment for Eastwood fans.  I'd say that applies to all four sequels.<br /><br />In this installment, Harry, the cop frustrated by the rules that hold him back, shows he has his limits when he goes up against wicked vigilante cops killing criminals without any due process.  As in the first movie, there's plenty of action, a car chase, suspense, people getting shot, etc.<br /><br />Special features:<br /><br />-- new commentary by director and Magnum Force screenwriter John Milius (\\"in this gritty, entertaining commentary, legendary Hollywood screenwriter Milius discusses Eastwood, the world of Dirty Harry and the rugged resilience of crime drama in American cinema\\")<br />-- new featurette \\"A Moral Right: The Politics of Dirty Harry,\\" with filmmakers, social scientists and authors on the politics and ethics of the Dirty Harry films<br />-- \\"The Hero Cop: Yesterday and Today\\"<br />-- trailer gallery<br /><br />The Enforcer Deluxe Edition<br /><br />In this installment, Harry, the renegade cop with some old-fashioned attitudes and no desire to be tied up with a partner, gets stuck with a female partner, well played by Tyne Daly.  Surprise surprise, he learns to respect and rely on her as they make hamburger of a group of domestic terrorists.  As in the first two movies, there's plenty of action, suspense, people getting shot, etc., but with a chase on foot in place of the usual car chase.<br /><br />Special features:<br /><br />-- new commentary by Enforcer director James Fargo<br />-- new featurette \\"The Business End: Violence in Cinema\\"<br />-- \\"Harry Callahan/Clint Eastwood: Something Special in Films\\"<br />-- trailer gallery<br /><br />Sudden Impact Deluxe Edition<br /><br />Sudden Impact inspires very mixed reactions, but it's still Clint Eastwood in a classic role, this time with Sondra Locke, his partner in several films and off-screen.  Some people hate Locke, but I think she's good with Eastwood.  (I liked them even more in the Dirty Harryish [[ASIN:6305308780 Gauntlet]] and the very un-Dirty-Harry [[ASIN:0790751569 Bronco Billy]].)<br /><br />Harry is on forced leave for being his usual trouble-making self while getting the bad guys, but still finds himself in the middle of a string of murders that he undertakes to stop.  As in a couple of the others in the series, this movie includes a story line where extralegal justice is an issue, as Locke's damaged rape victim seeks revenge.  With the usual action, shootings, and a high level of violence, with women getting their share.<br /><br />This one is the source of the famous quote, \\"Go ahead, make my day.\\"  It was directed by Eastwood.<br /><br />-- new commentary by filmmaker and Eastwood associate/biographer Richard Schickel<br />-- new featurette \\"The Evolution of Clint Eastwood,\\" on the film in the context of Eastwood's career as a director<br />-- trailer gallery<br /><br />The Dead Pool Deluxe Edition<br /><br />The Dead Pool was pretty well received, considering its place in the series.  It has a convoluted plot about a game in which bets are taken on the deaths of celebrities, including Harry, with young Liam Neeson playing a questionable film director who's playing the game.

B000JK8OYU|5.0|Last Fall, my wife and I went to Las Vegas for a short vacation. She had wanted to see one of the Circ du Soleil shows for a long time and decided that we would go see the \\"Love\\" show at the Mirage. I have always been very sceptical about Beatles compilation records or shows, fearing that some third party musicians would be playing the music. As a life-long Beatles fan, I know of no other musicians capable of playing their music.    That proved not to be a problem.    The show was WONDERFUL! The music is blended together to create a story that is ALL Beatles. I did not know prior to buying the album that it was mixed by George Martin and his son using many original tracks. They literally fit the music together into an inspirational mosaic of sound that will be treasured by any Beatles fan.    Fear Not!! \\"Love\\" is ALL Beatles!
B0015XHQTE|5.0|Warner Home Video has announced the details of new releases of all five Dirty Harry movies with new special features.  They'll all be in their original widescreen formats only.<br /><br />They will be available on standard DVD in this 7-disc Ultimate Collector's Edition, or separately in Special or Deluxe editions.  (\\"Special\\" is better than \\"deluxe\\" here--only Dirty Harry gets a 2-disc Special Edition, the others will all be on single discs, but all will have new special features.)

B000LPS3B2|5.0|At first glance Shutter could appear like many other Asian horror films with the scary girl, weird photos, black hair, and revenge.  With that said it stands alone as a well told ghost story with plot, acting, and scares.  If you liked The Changeling and The Devil's Backbone this film is for you.  One of the best Asian horror movies I've seen to date.  I watched this on the Sundance film channel as part of their Asia Extreme series of films which show a new film every Sunday at midnight and is commercial free.  Perhaps not the most ideal time for those of us with jobs, but it is worth taking the time to schedule it on your tivo or dvr.  The dvd features are to come being that after I watched this I am now buying it, it's a good add to any horror fan's collection, especially those who like the supernatural ghost story element.
B000ZINGIK|3.0|This is the first time I hear Avantasia and frankly I was a bit disappointed after all the praise I heard by other reviewers.     In my opinion at least, this is a mediocre CD. There is nothing unique about the music or even the concept itself. We've heard all of this before.    The vocals, well, Tobias Sammet is a screamer and if you enjoy this kind of singing, yes, do purchase it. But, I am surprised that TS included so many talented vocalists as guests on his CD. They certainly overshadow him and are not featured prominenantly as we are led to believe when we read the credits on the CD cover.     The ambitious scarecrow was good and so were a few more tracks. Alice Cooper also does a good job with the vocals. It is a shame Bob Catley was not given more solo parts.    Once again, this is my opinion and does not reflect how others will feel when they listen to this CD. I guess if you are an Avantasia fan, you will enjoy it, but sorry guys and gals, not me.
B00005OWIU|5.0|John Williams continues to amaze me! This soundtrack is not only a worthy companion to the movie, but to the books as well. He captures all the magic of JK Rowling's work at each and every turn.<br /><br />Hedwig's Theme, to me, should go down as one of the greatest music passages of all time. It's so myterious and magnificiently  magical. (That's sort of corny, I know, but it's true!)<br /><br />Now here's hoping he's back for Deathly Hallows.
B00005JLF5|5.0|I received the first season of Deep Space Nine as a gift and was thrilled to receive it!  I've had other friends, who have never seen Deep Space Nine before,and I've had the pleasure of introducing DS9 to them.  After watching Season One and Season Two, seeing how the story lines are developing, we can't wait to obtain Season Three.  Once the collection is complete, I can't wait to go back and watch it again as often as I want!
B00006IR5S|5.0|This soundtrack, if possible, exceeds the quality of the previous score in this series. Williams builds on old themes and creates new ones. A must have!<br /><br />The prologue features Hedwig's Theme, one of my all time favorites. What follows is a masterfully composed musical adventure, from the sinister \\"The Chamber of Secrets,\\" to the stirring \\"Fawkes the Phoenix,\\" and the friendly strings of \\"Reunion of Friends.\\"<br /><br />Another one of my favorites is \\"Dobby the House Elf.\\" It has a sort of subtle nobility, if that makes sense.<br /><br />Overall, a very, very good score. Almost each song is fun to listen to, moving through the story with as much excitement and magic as the film and book.<br /><br />A must have for not only Potter fans, but music fans in general.

0452289963|3.0|First off, this is not, in my  mind, one book, but two.  One is a wonderful psychological examination of the spirit (albeit not a new one), and the other is a ridiculous book that claims to be about spirituality... minus God.  Since I find God to be the epicenter of spirituality, I find this theory odd at best.    I believe there are a few \\"religions\\", or \\"groups\\" who preach that if we follow their path, we can all become \\"God\\" or \\"gods\\", which Tolle would surely say is the ultimate ego.  The Uber-ego, \\"as it were\\".  However, to spend SO much time focusing on oneself and one's ego and the possible destruction of said ego seems JUST as asinine, and ego-filled.  Not to mention, isn't saying \\"I have no ego.  My ego died.\\" almost the most egoistic thing one could say?  Tolle said this on Oprah's broadcast in show #2, which I thought was bizarre.  He would have been more humble to say, \\"Perhaps I'm close.\\" or \\"It is a lifelong goal of mine to get to that point.\\"  But no, he apparently has mastered it- he has \\"NO\\" ego.  Well bravo.    I do sincerely enjoy his ideas on psychology and the idea that we can put aside our past worries, memories and fears and embrace the us that is alive today.  Okay- that all seems fine.  (And I'm only half-way through this book.)  However, I have no desire to be an empty bucket of nothingness either.  I enjoy working on my emotional life.  I enjoy breaking down misconceptions and preconceived notions.  But I'm still not reduced to a blank slate either.    My other problem comes into play whenever he \\"quotes\\" Jesus.  First, why is someone who begins his book with evolution, bothering to quote Jesus?  If Jesus is known to have been a good man, and the Bible known to be- for the most part- historically indisputable, then why base his opening on evolution?   If he believes in evolution, then he can jolly-well leave Jesus out of it, especailly when he misunderstands almost every verse he quotes?  (The only one I agree with is the one in the beginning explaining that to \\"sin\\" means \\"to miss the mark\\".  This is the accurate and literal translation, and the term to \\"sin\\"  has become wildly misunderstood by the church.)    I am saddened by Oprah's blind faith in this author.  I appreciate all she does for the world, and I think she's a wonderful person, but just like any friend, I cannot agree with her 100% of the time.  She would do well with some lessons in critical thinking.  She has strayed from the beliefs she was raised with, and is getting sucked into new-ageism and the idea that higher-consciousness is the focusing on oneself ad nauseam.    Lastly, I wildly disagree with his belief that we are, in essence, formless.  I believe that God made us, and whatever God thought was worth making once, will be worth making again.  Meaning, we are NOT just spirit in a human body, we are both spirit AND body, and WILL be once again after our earthly body dies.  Just like I think there will be sex in heaven.  I think there will be learning.  And therefore, possibly pain.  But a pain that brings about growth, and brings us closer and closer to God and to our truest self.  Why do people think that we're just ghosts who \\"happen\\" to have a body in this life, but won't again?  Did God make a mistake first time 'round?  (I'm not expecting anyone to like the way I think of heaven, and I'm aware it's a bit unconventional.  But I'm not reviewing MY faith here, I'm reviewing Tolle's ideas and simply bouncing them off what I believe.)    For myself I am reading it for the psychological ideas, but putting the spiritual comments back on the shelf to gather dust.  In fact, I will suggest my friends read it for the same reasons, but I cannot do that without a list of caveats as well.
B000002MG1|5.0|An unapologetically honest and - at times - dark peek into the truths that life cradles in it's sinewy arms. This disc never fails to make me look at my life through the dark, blurry lens of stark honesty. These songs rip me from my seat and i'm suddenly 19 again and in love with that girl again. The very one i pushed away so many times ... and i realize just how self absorbed i was.<br /><br />\\"Yeah, yeah we were all together lost in our little lives\\"<br /><br />\\"Distanced from one, deaf to the other\\"<br /><br />OK, so i realize how self absorbed i still am. Just ask Sunshine.
B00003JRCQ|5.0|In my opinion, this film is the very best version of film adaptations of Jane Austen's PERSUASION.  The casting seems perfect and the subtle physical transformation of Amanda Root (Anne Elliot) is incredible.  Having recently seen the new PBS/Masterpiece Theater version (didn't like the casting on that one), I think that the only place that it excelled over this version was in making the relationship between Mrs. Clay and cousin Elliot clearer--that the cousin wanted not only to marry Anne so he could inherit the estate, but to also have Mrs. Clay as his mistress on the side to prevent her from marrying Sir Walter Elliot and possibly producing a male heir to beat him out of the property.  That flaw was probably due to some footage ending up on the cutting room floor.  Overall, however, this earlier version is vastly superior and may be my favorite adaptation of all the Austen novels to date.
B0010X8NF0|4.0|I watched this movie with my two Indian, yoga-teacher neighbors. I kind of feared the worst with Hollywood actors doing their thing - in India. But I was pleasantly surprised. I've been to India twice and felt that except for the 'inside the train' scenes themselves, India was more or less realistically conveyed, and the actors (or story) didn't have them making total fools of themselves.  Well, except for when they bought that poisonous snake, maybe.. but basically they were likeable.    Much of the story seemed to be taking place in Rajasthan, or along the lines of the middle north west (you won't see Darjeeling). It was beautifully shot, though truth be told, it's not hard to get beautiful shots in India. Still, I've seen movies shot in other countries (which I've been to) that completely do not capture the feeling of the place and people. This one rather does (minus the 'on-the-train' scenes), though focus is on the actors of course. It's not bad riding along with them on a journey through India. If you ever wondered what it might be like looking out the window while riding through, say Rajasthan, here's your chance.
B000N4SHPS|5.0|I sort of lost track of the Rocky series after the first one--which I loved.  I generally don't go for \\"franchise\\" movie sequels, but this movie totally took me by surprise--it was that good.  My family has watched ROCKY BALBOA several times now and we like it better each time.  We especially appreciated the commentary by Sylvester Stallone.  The themes of the first ROCKY film are still there:  don't let what others think or say about you deter you from what you know you are called to do, make the best of who you are and what you have (imperfect though that may be), treasure and support your friends, when you are going through tough times and loss let yourself feel what you are feeling, reach out to others even when you are hurting yourself, never give up, and so on--but there is a sensitivity and sweetness to this movie that I haven't seen in a film in a long, long time.  ROCKY BALBOA is edifying and redemptive while not being preachy.  It's the kind of movie you feel better after having seen it but, at the same time, you are thoroughly entertained.
B001041JLE|5.0|I ALWAYS ENJOY HEARING AND DANCING TO MICHAEL JACKSONS MUSIC.    NO MATTER WHAT HAS BEEN SAID ABOUT THIS MAN, HE IS AND ALWAYS WILL BE THE KING OF POP.  NO ONE CAN EVEN COME CLOSE TO HIS SINGING AND DANCING ABILITIES. I HOPE EVENTUALLY HE MAKES A COME BACK.
0060899220|5.0|I loved this book.  It's funny, raw, irreverent...It reads pretty much the way Bourdain sounds on NR.  If I had ANY thoughts of working in a fast-paced restaurant, this book convinced me that life in that environment is not for me, but it makes for great reading.
B0014Z4OQG|5.0|This movie was great, the concept used was amazing. Despite what many people say, this movie didn't cause me and headaches, dizziness or the like. I fully enjoyed the first person experience. Definitely worth it, though I'm sure the DVD won't give the same thrill as the theatre experience.
0783225849|5.0|Psycho was a film made by Film Legend Alfred Hitchcock in 1960. It was based on the book, Psycho, which was written by Robert Bloch. The book was loosely based on Wisconsin Serial Killer Ed Gein. The film tells the story about a secretary that embezzles money from her employer. She goes on the run after doing so yet, because of weather & fatigue, decides to stop by The Bates Motel. Yet, her stop there proves to be her undoing. Out of all of Alfred Hitchcock's movies, this is the movie he is most fondly remembered for. The movie stars Anthony Perkins, Janet Leigh(mother of Scream Queen Legend, Jamie Lee Curtis), Vera Miles, John Gavin, Martin Balsam, & John Mcintire. The Shower scene in the movie has been studied and discussed over and over as to why it is so terrifying and why many has tried to copy it through the years. This collector's edition includes extras like newsreel footage surrounding the making and release of the movie; an archive of production stills; the special trailer in which Hitchcock himself leads viewers around the Bates place; credit designer Saul Bass's original \\"shower scene\\" story boards; posters and advertising materials for the movie's William Castle-like publicity campaign (No One Will Be Seated After the Feature Begins!); and, the piece de resistance, a 90-minute documentary on the making of the film!<br />The movie itself was so succesful that it spawned three sequels(one of which was directed by Perkins himself), a made-for TV movie called The Bates Motel, and a remake that stars Anne Heche-Vince Vaughn-William H. Macy-Viggo Mortensen(of Lord of the Rings fame)-& Julianne Moore. The movie was also the very first movie to start the 'Slasher' Genre of movies.<br /><br />This movie is a classic that deserves to be in any film lovers' collection.
B000000Y1H|5.0|Brilliant Corners is probably my favorite Monk CD. That's saying alot, because I have more than 10 of them. For me, the first 3 selections are intoxicating. As great as Monk is throughout, the horn men keep me coming back to this CD time after time.     Alto saxophonist Ernie Henry excels on Bolivar Blues with a straight-forward, effective solo. One can only imagine what he could have accomplished had he not died so prematurely in 1958-less than 2 years after this album was released.     A familiar observation about Monk's music is that it is exceedingly difficult to play. While I can't confirm or deny this with any kind of intellectual depth, I do hear what sounds to me like hesitation in some parts of the tenor sax solos, esp. on Bolivar Blues. Nevertheless, tenor man Sonny Rollins is a revelation here. He seems to play most freely on Brilliant Corners; while his work on Bolivar Blues is motivational; and on Pannonica, he is stunningly poignant. The overall musical beauty of Pannonica is all the more pronounced when one considers that Monk wrote it for the Baroness Pannonica de Koeningswarter-the legendary patron and close friend to so many jazz musicians, including Monk and Charlie Parker. It also doesn't hurt that Monk and Rollins enjoyed a rare musical and personal rapport.    Those with far more musical training than I can debate the difficulty of Monk's music. But one thing is clear: as difficult as it may be to play, it is NOT hard to listen to. Hearing the collective brilliance of Monk, Rollins, Henry, Max Roach Oscar Pettiford and Clark Terry on this CD makes me a stand a bit straighter, walk a bit taller, and appreciate jazz all the more.
B000000993|5.0|i have loved this album since it debuted way back in the 90's. The combination of severe guitar and prophetic lyrics allows for you to totally get lost in the music and prevents it from being just background static during your casual day. Download it to your iPod/MP3 and commence with your days events!!
B0007M22TI|3.0|I am responding to D. Henderson.  You are partially correct.  Actually, this is common in many if not most \\"live\\" DVD concerts, that they have dubbed over sound and/or video.  If they have the budget, this may encompass many performances over several dates.  However, this was billed at one location.  In that case, they may have done a song two or more times to get the shots they want.  As for the audio, they will take the best performance of a song, and \\"sweeten\\" it, by doing in-studio overdubs or cutting in from the alternate live takes.  The editor is then responsible for adjusting the lip sync to within an acceptable range.  Some editors are better at this than others, and sometimes its the monitoring that can affect the outcome.  In reality, it is rare that a performance is transfered to final video output \\"as is\\", regardless of the performer.
B000TGJ80S|5.0|I am in awe from watching this spectacular film. From the opening scene, I was hooked. The music is some of the best I have ever heard in film. Gary Oldman gives the performance of the year as Dracula. The costumes and colors are incredible. And the special effects, well, they are to be seen, to be believed. Highly recommended.

B000ZM1NRC|5.0|Somerset Maugham is an amazing writer. He style is clear and straightforward but packed with thoughtful meaning and introspection. The Razor's Edge is the story of life's journey that resonates with anyone who questions the materialistic values of the modern day. It is timeless. One of my all time favorites.
1594489505|5.0|After finishing The Kite Runner, I yearned for more.  But when I saw A Thousand Splendid Suns and read the jacket, I feared that Hosseini had merely re-dressed his first novel, literally.  While the two share the author's authentic style, they could not differ any more.  While The Kite Runner focused on two male childhood friends, this one delved more into the intertwining of two women's lives due to the religious aspects of the Muslim culture while forcing the reader to face the misogynistic tendencies.  Hosseini not only entertains us with another page turner, but educates as well, about a world that remains a secret to most of us. Thousands have read this insightful work; now that we have, to whom will we abdicate our knowledge of what we have learned?
B00005JKHN|3.0|The movie is cute, but I have a few problems with it that ultimately made me decide not to buy it after I rented it:    1) It's too much like one of Tchaikovsky's ballets, of which I'm not much of a fan.  I haven't seen his version of Sleeping Beauty (on which this was based), but I have seen his version of The Nutcracker; if you like to watch ballet, you might enjoy this one, but otherwise, no.  It is not the kind of thing I would expect from a Disney movie.    2) We don't see enough of Aurora or Prince Phillip.  (In fact, it seems that Aurora is better known through Disney Princess products than through the actual movie.)  We see them dance together one time, and then they don't do much after that.  OK, we can forgive the fact that Aurora sleeps on the job (which is really what she's doing; the original tale had her sleep for a hundered years and not meet the prince until he woke her up), because it is, after all, Sleeping Beauty.  But even when Phillip is trying to rescue her, he's just a paper tiger; the fairies do all the work by releasing him from his prison, giving him a sword and shield, turning the arrows that are shot at him into flowers, etc.  It's really the fairies who rescue her, while the prince gets all the credit--and no one in the movie notices this!  Again, this is not what I expect to see in a Disney movie.    Still, it's interesting to watch from the point of view of a student of animation.  Fans of Nintendo will notice how much the castle looks like the castle from Super Mario Bros. and how much one of Maleficent's henchmen looks like Ganon (the villain from The Legend of Zelda).    If you want a better movie with a similar concept, try Snow White.  If you want one of Disney's movies from around that time, try Cinderella.  My absolute favorite Disney Movie is The Little Mermaid; if you haven't already, I recommend that you buy that one instead.
B000ZLFALI|1.0|This DVD was a total waste of money. The story was lame and the music an insult to any true Beatle fan
B000TKW3E2|5.0|This music is absolutely enchanting. I love the juxtaposition of musical elements; for example the sounds of the typewriter along with the music of the piano. Highly recommended for those who appreciate the beauty of a well composed film score.
B0000UJDLM|2.0|This movie deserves much more than a non-anamorphic transfer.  C'mon 10 year old quality on a new dvd.  A rip off for those of us who care about Johnny Five
B000MRAAJM|5.0|Planet Earth, the series, is without doubt, the finest nature film ever made.  All of their shots are breath-taking, with some appearing to be almost impossible to make.  How they were able to capture so much wild-life, and rare wild-life at that, on film is both a wonder and a testament to the dedication the producers and film makers brought to the project.    And if you own a Blue Ray Disc Player, this is one film (there are four discs) that is simply a must for your collection.  In fact, such is the realism and dynamic impact, I mounted my digital camera on a stand and took still frame shots of some of the images directly off my new 52\\" LCD TV screen.  At 1080p, I've never seen a nature film that comes anywhere close to matching the grandeur and beauty that this series offers.  The photography is so good, one might mistake it for an art film.    This is a must-have.

B0011NVC9I|2.0|There are many good things in this movie: The actual characters from the Epic, the basic setting, the intense violence, Grendel, even Grendel's mother.  However, and I admit that I am biased here,I just don't think you can re-write a mythic tale that has survived for 1000 years to satisfy a modern director's idea of a good plot.    This movie is not Beowulf, it is a movie based upon the Beowulf epic.  As such, it changes the central theme of the actual epic: The war between heaven hell being fought on earth as a struggle between good and evil, man and monster.  I suppose that modern ideas of heroism can not accept the mythic heroism of the epic, but I feel that those very ideas are what make the original epic a truly great story.      Taking those elements out make this movie a morality tale about a false hero reaching redemption at last.  The movie reflects the cynicism of the modern era I suppose, but it loses the epic qualities of the original poem.
B000002MZ6|5.0|I've been an Oldfield fan since my early teens, and in his music I have discovered many seminal moments. Ommadawn is awesome, and he performed that aged 22. The last movement of Crises is a visceral onslaught, with the tour-de-force Simon Phillips in harmony on the drums. There have been glimpses of brilliance throughout the years, and, let's face it, plenty of disappointments, yet in The Songs of Distant Earth Mike Oldfield produced his masterpiece. So many reviews here say it all: this one carries you away, and the whole Universe is open to you. It really is a unique piece, and good enough to be described as close to perfection, wave after wave of luscious composition, layer upon layer of floating synth, lilting guitar, and then that crescendo guitar atop Track 16, Ascension. No-one makes the guitar wail like Mike - the musical equivalent of a great orgasm leading to the beginnings of life, and in outer-space. Yes, the man got this one so bang-on right. Beautiful.
B0013FDM7E|2.0|While watching this horrible retelling of Matheson's brilliant I AM LEGEND, I was struck by the frightening similarity between the exaggerated facial characteristics of the rabid infectoids of this flick and those rebellious androids of I ROBOT, also starring Will Smith. Weird. The CGI faces are identical. Leftover CGI from I ROBOT? Or the same bad Special Effects team? Or does this Scientologist know something about the future that I don't know? The CGI in this looks stupendously awful. (Nothing looks real in this movie. Even New York looks a storyboard.) I thought I was watching the Prequel to I ROBOT. Will Smith once again battles bad CGI characters run amok. Yeah, bwoy!!<br /><br />For the sake of realism, the commercial/music video director, Francis Lawrence should have used real actors and animals instead of this low-budget CGI. Alas, it still wouldn't have saved this from the awful screenplay. However, Smith does get to act crazy with a mannequin. And, he gets to recite lines from his favorite movie, SHREK. Hey, now. A reviewer below compares this to Dawn of The Dead. NOT EVEN in the same ballpark!! The remake or the original!<br /><br />Will Smith is NOT BAD in this. At least the writers and producers kept him from saying one too many smart alecky one-liners and kept him from acting like his usually off-putting conceited self. After his genuinely affecting performance in THE PURSUIT OF HAPPYNESS, this is definitely a step down for him. It doesn't serve him well.<br /><br />NOTE: It would have been apropos if Charlton Heston would have sung a Bob Marley tune in THE OMEGA MAN, as he fills a couple of plague ridden albinos full of white hot lead. Of course, THE OMEGA MAN was made before Marley got famous, so Heston could have hummed a few bars of Harry Belafonte's Banana Boat Song. They missed a great opportunity to add real depth to Heston's character.<br /><br />Will Smith seems destined to fashion his career into a string of low-rent sci-fi movies from superior quality sci-fi books. If so, maybe next time he'll do that crazy Scientology Legend of Xenu. (If you've never heard this story, Google it. Some of your favorite movie stars actually believe this stuff.) Now, that would be a great flick... No, wait. Come to think of it, L. Ron Hubbard was a hack. My only hope is that Will Smith doesn't decide to remake DUNE.<br /><br />Two Stars. One Star for a great performance by a German Shepherd in a Lead Role, and another Star for only being 90 minutes in length.<br /><br />Critics actually enjoyed this? Normal people too?<br /><br />Are you kidding me?so, maybe next time he'll do that crazy Scientology Legend of Xenu. (If you've never heard this story, Google it.

0143038419|1.0|This was such a disappointing book.  Too bad there isn't a half star! The author is so self absorbed and superficial.
0812975219|3.0|Key requirements of a good book are that it challenge what I think I know and that it introduce me to interesting new ideas. So, despite its many faults, I am giving this book three stars. It challenged much of what I learned in finance and statistics, has spurred me to think more carefully, and has given me a number of great suggestions for further reading. The book's faults can be very distracting, however. Mr. Taleb is an ungracious, needlessly petulant writer whose attacks on others seem grounded in unthinking animus rather than substance. Instead of getting absorbed in his exposition (as in a great book, like \\"Theory of Justice\\"), I found that Mr. Taleb's sense of superiority frequently distracted me from his arguments. Had he had a stronger-willed editor and replaced his gratuitous ad hominem attacks with more details supporting his main points, this might have been a great book.

0452289963|4.0|A person will get the most out of this book if they are in a certain place spiritually and ready to let go of the traditional American way of getting ahead and having it all. It has a mix of major Eastern religion philosophies, with many references to Christian principles that line up with the points he wants to make. The major focus is on how our Ego holds us back and how we should be still, focus on our breath and basically get out of our own way. The book has helped me to focus on what is truly important in life: We are who we are already - we just need to be in a state of perpetual awareness/consciousness & let go of our Ego (our crazy thoughts & expectations of ourselves and others). It's not easy to unwind a lifetime of conditioning of our Ego - it will to take some practice to stay \\"awake,\\" to stay conscious, stay in the moment. The book is a very interesting read and has been helpful to me. My only issue is that I wish he had written more on the \\"active doing,\\" how you actually live out the principles in the book.

1593083580|4.0|I finally got around to reading this lovely novel by the infamous Jane Austen. It was written in her middle age and published posthumously. Slightly shorter and less intense than Pride and Prejudice, Persuasion is still detailed and enjoyable, full of Austen's trademark wit, deft dialogue, and insight into human nature.    The protagonist is Anne Elliot, the twenty-seven-year-old daughter of a baronet. Like other Austen heroines, Anne shares little sympathy or similarity with her family members. Her one romantic attachment is over half a decade old - she was engaged to a naval officer whom her friends disapproved of.  At the beginning of the novel, Anne goes to stay with her married younger sister. Her father and older sister have been forced to give up their family home because of their spendthrift habits. Captain Wentworth, Anne's former fiance, reappears in her life, and Anne is forced to learn to interact with him in a polite and detached way. She must watch him pursue others, and decide how to respond to her own suitors.    The entire novel is engaging and good, though at times I found Anne almost too calm a heroine. I absolutely loved the climax of the story, near the ending. It is so sweet and surprising. Persuasion is not to be passed over by a Jane Austen fan, or anyone who likes an enjoyable read.
0452289963|5.0|This is an outstanding book and for me, easier to grasp than \\"The Power of Now\\".

B000XRG9IW|4.0|I was quite surprised at how much I enjoyed this album, after realizing how much it reminded me of many seminal '70s prog rock and psychadelic bands from my flaming youth....pages from the playbooks of Pink Floyd (especially in their use of vintage keys and synth sounds), Led Zeppelin, early Black Sabbath and Rush, and more surprisingly, Uriah Heep and Blue Cheer are liberally plundered, but Black Mountain more than manage to give it a style of their own. Very cool, relaxing and rhythmic rock music with some nice folk and prog leanings...you can practically smell the incense. Or IS that incense? (laughs)

Sure, \\"Master of Puppets\\" has a few great songs, and so does \\"And Justice For All\\".  However, those two great albums pale to their predecessor, Ride the Lightning.  This album has great vocals, great Guitar playing, good druming and killer Lyrics.  This Album is an instant classic.

B000BJS4SU|5.0|Those who hate John don't get him.  That's fine.  Leaves more seats available for the fans who DO get him.  Blues is blues.  Soul is soul.  If it sounds right, it doesn't matter if it's an 80 year old white grandma.  I swear I think people hate on others out of jealousy - think they can do better but didn't get the break, or don't like to see \\"Wonderland\\" guy show even more depth and soul than he had thus far.  John makes what he makes, he makes no excuses.  He felt he'd done just enough of the acoustic pop, and wanted to get to his bluesy side, the side he alway felt was there but wasn't ready to come out.  \\"TRY!\\" was it's time to come out.  Here, he proves that he does not hide behind flawless productions in the studio - he is out there with two other KILLER musicians who are helping lift him up and get to where he's going musically, and it JUST WORKS.  Watch some live performances on YouTube if you still think his guitar chops are questionable.  He has proven he has the talent with the guitar, his silky, husky voice matches perfectly with not only this soulful blues/rock, but with his sweet acoustic pop.  He is an \\"all around\\" musician with something to say, and we should pay attention.  And lest anyone think JM has a false sense of self - he knows he's the \\"white elephant\\" in the blues room, but I think he shows you he can do it, too, no matter how he got started.  How many more blues/jazz/soul endorsements do you need to get off his back???  Buddy Guy, B.B. King, Clapton, Herbie Hancock, John Scofield, etc.  \\"Who Did you Think I Was\\" tells it all - you though he could ONLY sing sweet panty-dropping songs, but he shows you he can do more - MUCH more, and it's believable.  Bottom line - if you're a lover of music, when it's good, then you can judge this fairly as a GREAT soulful blues rock album.  I just don't see how anyone can deny the talent present by these three men.  Give it a try...
0143038419|5.0|What a wonderful book!  The author takes you on a journey, not just by traveling miles but also traveling the depths of the soul.  So encouraging and uplifting.  Good for any woman seeking to find what really makes her happy.

B000Y7U98W|4.0|I never heard of this movie, before I got it for a birthday present.  Quite simply, if you have a Blu-ray player and a receiver capable of playing the DTS-MA, you'll want this disc.  The movie has great scenes for bringing out the high resolution video.  More importantly, the engineers tweaked the soundtrack to provide sound that really exercises all speakers.  It's one of the most interesting Blu-ray discs I have.  Very interesting to listen to and watch...
B000ZLFALI|2.0|I'm a Huge Beatles Fan and this movie did not made justice for the kind of music they used. The story was so plain, the singing was very teenage girl-like and the videos were so forced into the songs that they did not even made any sense. I believe making a movie with this theme was essential for our times, but this one does not keep up with the weight of working with something that is so important to so many people as Beatles music. If you are a Beatles fan, see it and see for how long you can watch without getting angry.
B0011QC9U6|5.0|I am Ripper... Tearer... Slasher... Gouger. I am the Teeth in the Darkness, the Talons in the Night. Mine is Strength... and Lust... and Power! I AM BEOWULF!<br /><br />Easily the best line from a movie that I can remember and this is one of the many reasons why I gave this film a 5 star rating.<br /><br />For those who aren't familiar with the notion of Beowulf, let me fill you in and give you the lowdown of where it all came from. Beowulf is an epic poem without an author, thought to have been written some time between the 8th and the 11th Century. The story of the film seems to follow the poem quite accurately but I must be honest that I haven't read the full poem myself.<br /><br />The Movie: Beowulf, an arrogant man who is known as the hero of Geats, comes to defend a Danish mead hall from a relentless monster known by them as Grendel. Grendel is a 20 foot tall beast that can be described only as a freak of nature and after killing most of Beowulfs most loyal men Beowulf manages to take down the monster. After the battle Beowulf questions the king about Grendels father who the king says \\"you wont have to worry about the father\\" it is Grendels mother who he must now go after to free the kingdom of its curse. When Beowulf finds the lair of Grendels mother we learn she is a temptress who uses her sexual seduction and god like beauty to tempt Beowulf with a bargain he can't refuse. Give me another son and I will make you king.<br />Foreword a few years and we are shown a very different Beowulf, he is beaten and broken, he has lost all excitement from the battles and challenges he faced before he was king. We see him confronted by an enemy soldier who challenges Beowulf to a fight, Beowulf confronts this soldier and tells him \\"You can't kill me, I'm already dead.\\"<br /><br />The Review: At the risk of telling you too much, I will stop there but let me tell you what I thought of the movie. This is made entirely in CG which I found unbelievable to say the least as this is once again a leap ahead in this type of animation. At times I felt myself questioning whether they had filmed some parts in live action and had animated the CG around it. I was shocked to find out that, no this film is 100% CGI and it truly is spectacular although at times a let down.

0312323867|4.0|I almost didn't pick up \\"Something Blue\\" due to my lack of interest in the characters and dialogue in \\"Something Borrowed\\"; yet, I did. What started out with me giving Emily Giffin a second chance turned into me actually enjoying this book; so much so that I read it from cover to cover in hours.     While I wasn't fond of Darcy in \\"SB\\", I at least found her characterization more interesting (far more interesting than Rachel). I was interested to see how she would be expanded upon in her own book, and was glad to see there was more to her than just being a vapid, self-involved party girl. I found her growth from the start of the book to the person she becomes in the end very natural and even compelling; I absolutely adored her budding relationship with Ethan (which may I add was a pleasant surprise once realized the plot was going in that direction). I found myself cheering for her in the end and thoroughly enjoying this book.

0385338902|4.0|\\"I had a wife.  Her name was Hailey.  Now she's gone.  And so am I.\\"<br /><br />Doug Parker is a twenty-nine-year-old widower facing the most painful thing a person could go through: he has lost significant other to a plane crash.  His grief runs deep, and he misses his wife more than anything.  He is angry with the world, and he believes in no one or in anything.  As if his own problems weren't bad enough, he has a stepson going through his own grieving issues.  His family is beyond dysfunctional.  His twin sister is pregnant and has left her husband; his younger sister is marrying to a man she met when Doug's wife died; his father has a bad case of Dementia and his mother, a former actress, deals with everything by popping tranquilizers like they were candy.  Life seems pointless for Doug, but not for the people around him.  In his upper-class Connecticut neighborhood, he has become something of a celebrity and a babe magnet.  Single women seek him out, desperate housewives seduce him.  A struggling writer, he once wrote a magazine column called \\"How to Talk to a Movie Star.\\"  In his grief, his column became \\"How to Talk to a Widower.\\"  And his career seems promising all of a sudden.  His columns have become so popular that publishers are offering him gigantic book deals.  But none of that matters to Doug.  In his mind, he's a screw-up.  Always has been, always will be.  The one good thing in his life -- his beautiful older wife Hailey -- is gone forever.  What is the point of everything else?<br /><br />Jonathan Tropper is a great writer.  His novels are edgy and cutting edge -- his language dark, frank and at times brutal.  He is often compared to Nick Hornby, but he's got a great style of his own that makes him stand out among other \\"lad lit\\" writers.  What I like about How to Talk to a Widower is that Doug is truly sympathetic in spite of his somewhat anti-heroish attitude.  He has depth, lots of it, and you feel his pain.  His grieving process is very believable.  Doug is, in all purposes, a very sensitive man, especially now that he grieves for his beloved wife, and that makes him very appealing to the opposite sex.  Tropper has finally created a character whose \\"I'm a loser\\" attitude actually works in the storyline, for the heroes in his previous novels come across as whiny and petty for no good reason in comparison.  The novel loses momentum in the last several chapters -- the scenes become too melodramatic and Hollywood film-like for my taste -- but the story itself is compelling and addictive and I cannot recommend it enough.ble.

038572179X|4.0|Having seen the film first, this book afforded no real surprises in terms of plot. The language was dense and difficult to enter into for quite some time, and I had to force myself to keep reading for the first 100 or more pages. The characters were interesting enough to keep me going, but the action and the way it was told left something to be desired.<br /><br />However, as often happens with these types of styles, my efforts to finish the novel paid off handsomely. The prose, the imagery and the overall wording of McEwan really came to life a little before the halfway mark, and it really helped to bring the emotion out of the page.<br /><br />This book reminded me of Love in the Time of Cholera in the way that after a little while, no matter what is actually happening in the story, the words themselves start to affect you in strange ways. I felt myself tearing up at some parts that, if I explained them to others, I would receive strange looks. But as I said, the phrasing and the language itself, though it began the novel as a barrier, becomes the essential aspect of the story.<br /><br />The film and novel are both fantastic, and though their stories are almost exactly the same, the way they are told make them both worth a look.

1594489505|4.0|Like \\"Kite Runner,\\" this novel deals with love and hope in the face of fear, desperation, sadness and loss. Hosseini crafts characters which are genuine and complex behind a facade of simplicity, and I found I could identify with some part or portion of almost all of them. The story really drains you by spanning generations and lifetimes. In this way, it made me feel like I had gone on the journey with these two women, and had been beaten down and raised up emotionally alongside them.<br /><br />The story and characters definitely kept me intrigued, but I didn't feel that addictiveness I feel with really fantastic books. I didn't get that sense that I had to be late to work or stay up late into the night to finish another chapter, and I think that says something about the novel: that while it is definitely an incredible story, something about it lacked urgency. Maybe that's simply because it did span so many years, I felt like I had a whole lifetime to read it.<br /><br />Still, Hosseini has crafted a remarkable story and I look forward to what he comes up with next.
B000B5XOY8|4.0|This is a solid film. Not my favorite Batman film - I like Batman Begins more - but solid. The thing is, without one key player it wouldn't be as good. Yes, Tim Burton's directing is excellent, the visuals are respectable, and I like Prince's soundtrack a good deal more than I probably should (favorite songs: \\"Partyman\\", \\"Scandalous\\" and \\"Trust\\"). Visually, the film is a marvel - I especially like the portrayals of the Batmobie, the Batcave, and the Batplane. This enough to make it a good, 3.5 to 4-star movie.<br />But here's what brings it over the edge: The Joker. Jack Nicholson outdoes himself from his first appearance as the full-blown villain (a murder set to carnival music), pumping out a flurry of puns and one-liners, equipped with many memorable props, including a boxing glove on a spring, a gloved hand that pops out of a gift box, a hand buzzer with a sick twist, and a REALLY big gun. Just when you think he can't get any better or funnier, he does. It all peaks in the unforgettable clock tower scene, where he delivers one my favorite line in the movie. I won't spoil it for you, but it's brilliant.<br />The only real problem with the film is that all of the other major players step back and let Nicholson run away with the show. Michael Keaton's Batman is bland, lacking in the mystique that the role requires, though he makes for a good Bruce Wayne. His girlfriend Vicki Vale (Kim Bassinger) pretty much spends the entire film shrieking, a check in the \\"minus\\" column for her likability. Alfred (Michael Gough) is decent, but I prefer the dry-humored treatment he gets in Batman Begins. I like Robert Wuhl as the uppity reporter Alexander Knox, but sadly there's not enough of him.<br />This is a good film, but I think Batman Begins does a better job with Batman.

B00005KB9T|5.0|In 1973, this album popularized reggae on the world stage, and for very good reason. The guitar and drum work on this album is amazing. My favorite track is the opener, \\"Concrete Jungle,\\" the solo on steel guitar is incredible. This song is about the slums in Jamaica of which Marley knew first hand. This album has it's share of political songs like, slave driver, 400 years, and no more trouble, and it had the laid back songs. The most popular is Stir it up, which has some great organ work. The singing on this album is also great, with Peter Tosh contributing to a couple of the albums strongest tracks, Stop that Train, and Four-Hundred Years. This was the first reggae album I ever bought, and played it in my car for a good month with few breaks. It blew me away, I was later more amazed to find other reggae albums I liked even more, but this is a great starting place for Marley and Reggae in general. It is very different from later Marley, which I like better, but is great in it's own right, this album is essential to any reggae collection.
1416914293|4.0|Last week, I received a copy of CITY OF ASHES, book two in THE MORTAL INSTRUMENTS trilogy by Cassandra Clare, for review. I was so excited because I just loved the first book, [[ASIN:1416955070 City of Bones (The Mortal Instruments)]]. I wanted to read more about Clary, Jace, Simon, Luke, and the rest of the Shadowhunters and their adventures. This book, as with the first one, thoroughly entertained me. With this series, Cassandra Clare will easily make herself a household name.<br /><br />The story opens with Valentine summoning a demon to be at his beck and call. This demon plays against a person's worst fears. You would need a protection spell if you wanted to ward off the advances of that kind of demon. How is that for an opener?! Once again, Valentine is up to no good - no surprise there. At the end of the first book, Valentine gained control of the Mortal Cup, which can only mean trouble for...everyone. What is he up to?<br /><br />The last few weeks of this new seeing and slaying life has both exhausted and exhilarated Clary. Everything was so simple before that fateful night at the club. Clary was an ordinary teenager with an affinity toward drawing and manga. Now she can see werewolves, vampires, and fairies, and sketch her own runes. Plus, her mother is in a coma and Jace, one of the Shadowhunters who annoys and attracts her at the same time, turns out to be her brother. Bad news for Clary but good news for Simon, who used it to his advantage to get even closer to Clary. She has a tough choice to make about her future. Clary can leave the Shadowhunter world behind like her mother did, or she can become one of them and work toward finding out what Valentine's plan is now that he has the Mortal Cup.<br /><br />Clary is not the only one to go through personal upheaval. Jace is devastated that he is not who he thought he was. Nothing good can come out of being Valentine's son, which he learns when his \\"mother\\" returns home full of accusations. Soon he is cast out from the one place he can call home. The Inquisitor, a real peach of a lady, holds Jace's fate in her hands. Believe me, there is no love lost between his adoptive parents, his real father, and her. Needless to say, the meeting between them doesn't go well and he is sentenced to prison in the Silent City. Prison turns out to not be the safest place for Jace, as dear daddy pays him a visit there trying to get him to switch teams.<br /><br />Will Jace join Valentine or remain true to the Shadowhunter's virtues? And if he stays true to his Shadowhunter's roots, will he and his cohorts be able to stop Valentine before the rest of the mortal instruments are collected?<br /><br />To find out how these and many other surprises happen, pick up your copy of CITY OF ASHES.<br /><br />Reviewed by:  coollibrarianchicke can call home.

0375424474|5.0|What do a fossil bed in arctic sandstone, a med student's dissection lab, the Field Museum, and genetic studies of limb development have in common? Neil Shubin.<br /><br />This wonderful author draws on his wide experience as educator, researcher, and awed little boy to take the reader on a tour through the reader him-(or her-)self. He starts with features as visible as fingers - quite a development by the way, with many intermediate steps documented in the fossil record. Then he works his way back to the earliest weeks of fetus-hood, showing deep similarities between humans and every other species that has a fetus, and some that don't. The structural similarities aren't enough, though. He cites research that determines which genes control specific features of development, the same way in fruit flies or mice. He even points to studies that find similar genes in mice and sharks, despite millions of years of refinement and divergence, and shows that the mouse gene product has the same effect on shark development as on baby mice.<br /><br />Shubin achieves the ideal balance of scientific rigor and conversational clarity. He summarizes millions of years of evolution, maybe hundreds of millions, in homeobox development genes, using just a few pages and a few diagrams. Although some pictures contained elements I found misleading, they generally captured the essence of genetic and anatomical structure, but without the faux intellectualism of complex terms - the facts are clear and simple, even when he spares us the big words and lab drudgery. As he found out first-hand, even pre-schoolers can see the evidence and draw correct conclusions.<br /><br />For all the detail that he provides, there are volumes more that he never mentions. For example, a chemical mechanism that affects hunger in monkeys traces back to nutritional stress response in yeast - not that we descend from yeast, but that we descend from a common ancestor with the same problem that we have to solve today, and with a solution that keeps on working.<br /><br />By the end of this brief book, Shubin not only locates the human twig on the tree of life, he helps us appreciate how the flowering on every branch binds it all together into one beautiful whole. He shows evolution as such a wonderful pageant that I'm happy and proud to be part of it, even if my participation is only as product and observer. He also shows how studies in fish and fruit flies predict specific genetic diseases in humans, and how knowledge of geology and evolution let him pinpoint, to within a few hundred yards, one of about three places on earth where a specific moment in fishes' conquest of land was likely to reveal itself in fossils. Scientists do science because it's the biggest thrill they know how to make a living at. Shubin shares that excitement as very few authors ever have done.<br /><br />-- wiredweirdat keeps on working.

B000E1155O|4.0|I checked this out because I've listened to my two Vashti Bunyan albums about a thousand times (and still not sick of them, never could!) and wanted something in the same vein. Well, the voice and feel is a little Vashti-ish but much more Chan Marshall with a soupcon of Suzanne Vega; very much in the vein of the Cat Power \\"Covers\\" album. This is not sweet pastoral English folk, but rather moody, introspective psych-folk.  It's slow, weird but strangely catchy. I find myself humming, \\"tonight...when I came home from wuck...\\" (her strange accent makes this all the more charming). The music backing Sibylle's gorgeous voice sounds like PURE Leonard Cohen to me.  I mean, if you like early Leonard Cohen, you'll love this woman.  And I do, so I'm digging it.  Apparently she just recorded this one night at her house during a dinner party in the 70's?  It's almost amazingly modern-sounding, but so clearly not trying-too-hard or anything like *twee* (listen to this as an antidote to Joanna Newsom).  Anyway,  I think this is the hippest thing I've come across in a while. Perfect to play at your own dinner party.

B00006ZXSK|5.0|I could watch this movie every day. Drew Berrymore is a good 'Cinderella', and portrays the part very well. Her character's name is Danielle, and \\"Cinderella\\" is just a nick name that the mean step-sister calls her. I like that Danielle is a very smart, well-read version of the character. Yes, she is a servant to the step-monster (Angelica Houston), and her two daughters, however, she spends lots of time reading by the fire, which is how this movie explains how the name \\"Cinderella\\" was derived. Dougray Scott plays the prince, and he is so easy on the eyes. You root for the two of them to be together.<br /><br />I highly recommend this movie. You'll especially like it if you are a young girl at heart who longs for the prince to rescue her and live happily Ever After.
B000J103WA|5.0|Anyone who appreciates classic iconic rock should NOT let this one pass them by. Defintitely the BEST purchase I have made on HD DVD to date. Clapton, Bruce, and Baker are still superb and are yet as good or better than 95% of the bands playing today. These 3 play so tight together you'd think they'd never broke up almost 40 years ago.    The audio (dts 5.1) is icing on the cake along with the extremely sharp video. I was glad to see the video showcases each musician's talent instead of the odd psychedelic crap from the vintage tapes. The interview also provides an interesting inside look at how this reunion came together.    I don't know if Rhino will ever release this on Blu-Ray, but if they don't, that will be their loss.    Pick this one up and if you even slightly like Cream, you won't be disappointed.

This latest instalment is nothing like their previous works and shows The Hives' incredible range and diversity. The album is a complete masterpiece. It's tied for my favorite album of all time with their Tyrranosaurus Hives album.

B00005JPTK|4.0|Interestingly, 2 adaptations of the Richard Matheson book have already been done with \\"The Last Man on Earth\\" and \\"The Omega Man\\" showcasing the same kind of premise of supreme loneliness and isolation. It's one of those stories that seems ripe for re-interpretations and such a simple idea can bring with it a number of tries to get the story going. This version is probably one of the better ones but it's not perfect by any means and it's either the closest we'll get to a great adaptation or it's just not the right approach.    Robert Neville is a military scientist trying to find the cure for a virus that wiped out nearly the entire world's population. Living in New York with his dog Sam, Robert spends his day renting videos in alphabetical order, chatting to mannequins he's set up and waiting at a pier in case people who hear his broadcast show up. But when the watch's alarm goes up, he heads back home before the sun goes down as strange sounds and creatures come out at night, leaving him to fend for himself while he tries to find a cure.    The first hour or so is one of the more well executed parts in the entire film and you're on your way thinking this is going to be a great movie. But then Neville turns out to not be entirely alone and the film kind of dips into \\"eh\\" quality. The screenwriters (one being Akiva Goldsman who's responsible for the unholy mess that is Batman and Robin) manage to keep our interest entirely by showing the various ways you can keep busy in a desolated New York. It changes a couple of elements from the book that work a bit better and thanks to the visuals which show vegetation growing out of the pavement, cars all over the streets and even wildlife showing up now and then it becomes impressive how well it's keeping our attention.    It's the last act which falls apart as it's not a bad idea storywise it's just handled improperly and starts with a couple scenes, involving Shrek and Bob Marley that fall completely on their face and they're just strange. Then of course there's the look of the creatures which, instead of taking the \\"guy in costume\\" approach, they're entirely computer-generated and they look so bad and practically PC quality that it's distracting.     Best thing easily about the movie is Will Smith who shows what a lot of people knew all along: he's an incredibly charismatic and likable actor that makes it hard not to want to watch him. But being the only actor for a large chunk of the film was a feat some were curious about and he doesn't just ham it up either and gives an emotionally charged performance that shows he can act and films like Ali or the Pursuit of Happyness are not his only forum for breaking his \\"Fresh Prince\\" persona, usually seen in the blockbusters.    Since it's probably the biggest DVD/Blu-Ray release this week, I'd have to recommend the film since everyone will want to see it but I'm not sure how many will enjoy it.

Keep in mind that I'm 19, like psychological thrillers and can't be fazed by books like Steven King or what-not ninety-nine times out of a hundred. This book spends not a word more than it needs to and it was pretty ridiculously terrifying. Possibly just because I think people with buttons for eyes is the most disturbing thing ever. Not to mention people unzipping their skins and whatever other semi-drug induced nightmares lie within this book  But yeah, this is totally going next to my John Bellairs collection and will be passed down to my children after they graduate Goosebumps or whatever the equivalent is in another twenty or so years. And they will be terrified out of their wits and then we will read The House With a Clock in Its Walls under the covers and not be able to sleep the rest of the night. Sounds like bonding to me!
B0010X8NF0|5.0|Wes Andersen is probably my favorite director right now but I understand that his films are not for everyone.  His unique and highly personal body of work seems to have a polarizing effect on audiences.  They typical reactions are either \\"brilliant\\" or \\"slow-moving.\\"  Most of his films revolve around a close look at family drama among dysfunctional adults, with a dry, quiet humor that takes some getting used to.  It's leagues away from your typical American \\"Meet The Fockers\\"-style slapstick comedy, in other words it attempts to provoke thought rather than belly laughs.<br /><br />The main criticism I would levy upon Wes Andersen's career trajectory is his tendency to essentially explore the same themes again and again in the same way - characters who are dysfunctional misfits coming together and making some sense of life.  The Royal Tennenbaums is the most successful of these films to date, with Darjeeling a close second.<br /><br />What makes Darjeeling work is the pairing of an imposed, forced spiritual journey with a real one that occurs when the characters are tested by true hardships.  Owen Wilson's character, the de facto ringleader of the three estranged brothers, has called them together in an attempt to rekindle their brotherly relationship via a journey through India.  He manages to convince the other brothers to participate in hokey activities designed to enlighten them spiritually, but that attempt fails horribly when it is derailed by reality.  However it is that reality - facing someone's death, possible maternal distinterest and a sense of futility that applies to the whole journey - that forces the brothers to really examine their lives and shed the baggage that they have both literally and figuratively been dragging around behind them for the duration of the film.  Far from being obtuse, the themes are obvious and clear - and the film succeeds for that reason.<br /><br />So a qualified but high recommendation - if your tastes veer towards subtle humor and somewhat self-conscious (or self-parodying?) artistry, this film could be a meaningful experience for you as it was for me.f-conscious (or self-parodying?) artistry, this film could be a meaningful experience for you as it was for me.
B000002KXV|5.0|Obviously there are SO many of us who hold this masterpiece in high esteem.    Needless to say, although referring to the 50's - it was a product that was years ahead of its time.    My son (now 13) will surely grow to love this classic. He grew up listening to it and other SD classics and never really thought about it.    And I am almost emotional when I say...it is, by far, my favorite piece of music.    JDT in Houston
0590447254|5.0|Great for pre-schoolers.  Some of the rhymes are a bit forced but it is charming nonetheless.  A very fun read!
B0007NMKB2|5.0|Remember the indie charts?  Remember when the word indie actually meant that the record you had was produced by an independent record company and it didn't just mean a particular sound of music or dress.  Remember when 'emo' was just  By word for a mid to late 80s trend in US punk?<br /><br />Those where the days when you actually had an 'alternative music' before combat pants became sold in high street stores and t shirts over long sleeves were just something worn not something you could buy stitched in.<br /><br />This band just came on the tail end before record companies realised that there was a last stream of music that they have swallowed up and churned out at will.  Those distorted guitars, the heavy bass and free rhythm that so personified bands like Jr, Soundgarden, Nirvana and others.<br /><br />This is music at its best and most free and kids who really think Fall out Boy and Green Day are the be all and end all of alternative music meed to check this out.
B000YEUUCK|5.0|This is the perfect concert with so many dancers i have ever seen before.  the blu-ray picture is so clear. i love it so much, keep watching and watching all over and over again.
B0000024YL|5.0|At one time I probably had the original record, but it is long gone, probably from over-playing.  I recently went to see a concert of Art Garfunkel and it brought back so many memories that I ordered two copies of the disc, one for me and one for a daughter.
B000TXZVGQ|5.0|Refreshing!!This timeless classic series is excellent entertainment for any person. It helps adults to understand some of the challenges that kids have in school and  reminds them of their own challenges or triumps in junior and high school.   Whereas for teenagers, it's relevelant and interesting. Danes is an excellent actress, and Leto is just too cute.

B00008YLV2|5.0|I am a huge special features junkie, so when I found out about this dvd I was jumping for joy! I love this movie and borrowed the standard version from my friend and was disappointed by the lack of special features. Here, there are deleted and extended scenes, behind the scenes footage, documentaries about the rangers that were there from the History Channel and more! It's simply fantastic! I would recommend this dvd for sure!
0800141660|5.0|I bought this movie for my girlfriend expecting to sleep through another Jane Austin chick flick but this one was very good!  It doesn't show on the cover, but the movie has the actors who play Dr. House and Professor Snape in it.  House is still greatly cynical but Snape's character is awkwardly sensitive (hilarious to compare to his other roles).  Hugh Grant, however, had a weak spirited character and came across very out of place.  The regular Jane Austin sarcasm came through and the drama side was surprisingly entertaining.  Guys:  this makes a great gift and you'll enjoy it too.
0307387178|4.0|This book will have a powerful affect on you, no matter what you take away from it.  Some would say Chris is following a romantic, transcendentalist, Buddhist-like existence and quest for truth.  Others would say he is an unrealistic, stubborn young idealist.  The author lets the reader decide this for themselves.  I got the feeling the author felt Chris' death was tragic and unnecessary.  However, some part of me says he was following a path to enlightenment, for want of a better word.  The only thing is he took an extreme path to that enlightenment, violating Buddha's teaching that the middle path is the best.  If he took the middle path, and picked up some maps, food, and better camping gear (not throwing out all of western society, but only some of it), most likely Chris would still be alive today.  But in the end he lived his life and made decisions as only each of us can, with the inevitable consequences we all must live with.    This book is worth reading for the perspective it gives on solitary figures.  A reading of history, for instance, Jaques Barzun's From Dawn to Decadence, gives a perspective on the historical roots of Chris's individuality, quest to test himself, and disdain for western society (his postmodernism).  It is unfortunate Chris himself never read this book, otherwise he would have realized his seeming \\"quest\\" was not unique to history and in fact resulted from deep seated western cultural trends (individualism, self determination, exploration, etc.).
B0000028VT|5.0|\\"Music Box\\" would have to be one of Mariah's greatest albums ever (in my personal opinion, that is.) Here's a review of the songs from this delightful album.    1.) Dreamlover: Such a cool song. It's so upbeat and fun to sing along to.  2.) Hero: A beautiful ballad talking about how there's a \\"hero\\" in all of us.  3.) Anytime You Need a Friend: This is a wonderful uplifting song.  4.) Music Box: A sweet ballad with the music played like a music box.  5.) Now That I Know: A good upbeat song that's fun to dance along to.  6.) Never Forget You: One of my favorite Mariah ballads. She talks about how she'll never forget her love. So sweet!  7.) Without You: A great beautiful version of this song originally sung by Nillson.  8.) Just To Hold You Once Again: Another soulful and uplifting ballad.  9.) I've Been Thinking About You: A cool hip\hop-like dance song.  10.) All I Ever Wanted: A beautiful ballad to end the album.     This album is absolutely beautiful. Enjoy!!!
B0012X6FT4|3.0|The Rhino two disc reissue has everything contained on the first disc and then some.  The re-mastering is fine on the Rhino release and this does not improve on it.  The packaging and liner notes are much better in the Rhino release.  The live concert on the second disc would be the only reason to purchase this release if you already have the Rhino release.  The concert was originally a radio broadcast from the Warner Theater in Washington DC a week or so before the officially released El Mocambo concert.  It contains an early solo version of \\"Chemistry Class\\" that was previously released on a different Rhino re-release (Armed Forces?).  The rest of the concert is presented here for the first time in its entirety.  So what are the differences between the Warner Theater concert and the El Mocambo concert?  The set lists are close though I've always thought that \\"Live at the El Mocambo\\" was edited to fit on one vinyl disc.  Here are a few differences: Lip Service is only on El Mocambo and No Action, Red Shoes, Hand in Hand, Blame it on Cain and Chemistry Class are only on the Warner Concert.  Both have the Dallas version of Less than Zero and the Wipeout drum roll version of mystery dance.  The Warner concert appears to be the whole show and I suspect that \\"Live at the El Mocambo\\" has the song order altered in addition to having a few songs cut.  Both concerts are about equal in the quality of the performance.  The band sounds deranged and hungry for success on both. It is \\"pull out the stops\\" rock and roll in its purest form.  Both have mistakes in playing and sound quality-wise the Warner concert has more stage buzzes.  There's no doubt that Elvis Costello and the Attractions are at their aggressive cocky best on both shows (The Warner show features Elvis stating, \\"Are some of you unimpressed?... cause I don't believe you!\\").  I would rate the Warner concert better as it sounds more \\"in the moment\\" than \\"Live at the El Mocambo\\" does.   It's a tough call for the dedicated fan as they could have released the concert as a single disc instead of attaching it to something we already have and charging a premium price.  I give it three stars cause it's all good stuff.
B0002F6AYS|5.0|I'm 16 years old and I love Children of the Corn, it's creepy without being gory. The dvd quality is great and the special features are fun. It was really interesting seeing John Franklin and Courtney Gains in the documentary for the 20th anniversary... they both look just as they were and it's cool hearing about their experiences on set, which is continued in the commentary. Great dvd, it's a great deal for those who love this movie.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Have you still not seen the show that was canceled before it even aired all its episodes and then went on to sell so many of these dvd sets that a big screen movie, \\"Serenity\\", was made from it?  This is one of the best tv series ever made.  The actors paired so perfectly with their characters.  A world (\\"a 'verse\\") so real and comprehensive.  Created by Joss Whedon, the master of the genre, creator of BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER and ANGEL.  Tim Minear also produces and writes and directs some episodes.  I promise you will be back to tell me I was right in strongly urging you to buy this!
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I've read a lot of reviews of this show, especially the 1 star one's who didn't like it (aside from the 1 star one's who say they loved it but gave it 1 star because Amazon screwed up) and I have to say this series is excellent.     First, it was completely marketed wrong. Though the story isn't that far fetched it has been met with some criticism from the \\"its a sci-fi/western combo\\" crowd. This does have western elements but the overall theme is very sci-fi and instead of focusing entirely on the gadgets and gizmos, they decided to focus more on the people and how they cope with hardships in the future. Think of this more like the developed world today versus the 3rd world. If anyone has ever been to a 3rd world country, the scenario in this show isn't all that far fetched, in fact, it's very very plausible except for some minor details. If you've ever seen a donkey pulling a half gutted automobile while the rider, wearing rags, talks on a cellular phone and has a rifle strapped to his arm, this show will bring you back to those life changing experiences.    Basically, the characters are on the edge of their civilized galaxy where very little technology is present, but that which is is quite a deal more advanced than ours. The tech in this show is very subtle in its display and often has to be called out for you to even notice such as holographic pool balls.    Point is, it is a really good show, and after watching it all for free online, I just ordered the box set. I hope this somehow finds a second chance. Most of the key characters are really multi-dimensional and those who aren't are still very likable if not in form then function.
B0013FDM7E|4.0|Like every fan of the genre, I was looking forward to the new version of Richard Matheson's classic I AM LEGEND. I've read the book many times and I've seen both THE LAST MAN ON EARTH and THE OMEGA MAN  too many times to count.<br /><br />This was probably a bad thing, I thought. It was going to be difficult for any film to live up to the kind of expectations you have with that kind of background. I wished I was one of those lucky people who would be going in cold and be able to just judge it on its own merits.<br />Yep, that would have helped, because towards the end the film makers lost their focus, got sloppy and frankly confused some of us who are familair with the book.<br /><br />Up until then, however, they were doing a wonderful job! The up-dating to the new century was smooth and forgiveable, the device that sets the plague and the plot in motion was slick and logical. Will Smith gave a touching performance as a man in complete isolation. I just hated those lousy computer generated vampires! And there weren't enough of them considering how many people had fallen to the plague.<br /><br />Maybe one day there will be a perfect adaptation of I AM LEGEND, probably not since perfection is subjective. Until then this is pretty damned close.<br /><br />Especially if you've seen THE OMEGA MAN!<br /><br />  Time has passed since my initial viewing of this film and I've been able to reconsider things in the harsh light of day. And I'm afraid that the sad truth is that this is a seriously flawed film that is carried only by the strong performance of its star. There are far too many questions that the viewer is left with afterwards: like how did the woman get on the island?  How did she get off? Remember the bridges and tunnels had all been destroyed long ago. If even 90% of the population had been turned into vampires there should have been a lot more of them then that, there seemed to be only a couple hundred vampires in all of New York City, even with computer generation. Why doesn't Neville ever monitor his radio to see if anyone is sending messages like he does in the book? Then he too might have learned of the safezone, it would have made sense for him to do that. And it would have made sense for him to do his lab work at night rather than as part of his day routine, those winter nights can be pretty long in the north and you wouldn't want to waste all your scavenging and hunting time doing stuff you could be doing at night. That's the way he does it in the book. And speaking of the safezone in Vermont or New Hampshire or where ever, that has confused some of the people I've spoken to. They seemed to think that it was safe there because of the cold! Well, if that were the case, why not Canada? It would hardly be a worldwide plague if cold killed the virus. But in all fairness, the people with whom I spoken people live in Florida and can't relate to the concept of cold very well. And there are many more examples I could give. And they are all evidence of sloppy writing.<br /><br />  In the end all of I AM LEGEND's serious flaws are caused by one thing; that is written by people who neither respect nor understand the genre in which they are working, and in the  retrospect it shows.<br />  I've been forced to lower my rating of it to a hesitant 3 stars.
0783225849|5.0|I received this dvd for Christmas and I was very excited! Alfred Hitchcock's \\"Psycho\\" is my absolute favorite movie and this dvd was more than just suitable. The quality is fantastic, the picture is clear and the sound is crisp. Not only that but the special features are great, with a documentary by the surviving cast and crew, film posters and original trailers. Anthony Perkins will forever be known for his portrayal of Norman Bates, the world's biggest mama's boy and true psycho. This dvd is a must for any classic movie collection!
B000R7I3LY|5.0|Sara Bareilles has a voice of an angel, no doubt. Her songs, which consists of pop, alternative, funk, and soul genres make you want to sing along song after song. I love listening to her after a stressful day or school and work. Her voice really does soothes my \\"soul\\". There is no other better way to describe it. A must buy!
B00005RIKI|5.0|Wow, Lynyrd Skynyrd certainly came out of nowhere with a bang!  A debut album that contains a MASSIVELY huge hit, along with two other ballady type \\"soft rocker anthems\\", and just for fun, a short and sweet hard boogie rocker (\\"Gimme Three Steps\\") to confirm they were, in fact, TOTAL southern rock right behind the Allman Brothers in terms of popularity.  So the album has a total of 4 hits.  That's how you make a statement!    One of the most underrated songs is actually \\"Poison Whiskey\\" with its energetic and forceful tone in the chorus.  Love the vocals on that one.  \\"I Ain't the One\\" has picked up popular steam in recent years.  Before 10 years ago or so, we never would have heard this song on the radio.  Now people wanna hear it.  \\"Things Goin' On\\" is just pure southern rock catchiness with its tasty instrumental parts and melodic singing sections.      Overall, one great album that certainly is a masterpiece.
B001031SUM|5.0|It's a great album!!  I love all the songs!! And I can't stop listening it!! Because it's so great!!!
B000W4HJ44|4.0|Let me first say I'm a fan of the original John Waters' film. I didn't see the Broadway musical so I can't compare it to the film.<br /><br />I thoroughly enjoy this movie every time I see it, and I watch it whenever I need a lift!  I love the performers (yep, even Travolta), the music, the choreography, the humor, the joie de vive. It's just pure fun. Yet the message of tolerance doesn't get lost in all the exuberance. It doesn't have the edgy, underground vibe of the original film, but that's okay. Both films I believe can stand on their own merits.<br /><br />When I first heard John Travolta had been cast as Edna Turnblad, I thought it was a smart casting choice. I was ingrigued to see his performance, which I'm sure was the point of casting him. However, it took me a while to warm up to it...the accent and the fat suit are kind of distracting at first. However, I've come to appreciate it and enjoy watching him. He doesn't \\"flop\\" around in the dance numbers as someone said. In fact, he's light on his feet.<br /><br />I think there are lots of clever casting decisions in this movie, but it's the young performers who steal the show and are the truly triumphant choices. Nikki Blonsky is a great find! Zac Efron, Elijah Kelly, Britney Snow, James Marsden, Amanda Bynes are all terrific.
0345455681|5.0|This is the 2nd book by Edward Rutherfurd I have read, \\"The New Forest\\" was the first, and I found it just as fascinating.  The historical research behind each century of life in London, must have taken so much time.  He has woven, like a fabric, so many lives and loves into what is in the end a fascinating tapestry.  It is a collection of wonderful short stories with a common thread to tie them all together.  Great characters, wonderful descriptions, both of the city itself and its inhabitants, and it ends on a thought provoking statement about touching the past.  Super book.  For anyone who likes a long read, this is an amazing book.
B00000JNO1|5.0|Nuthin' Fancy is the most underrated album Lynyrd Skynyrd ever made.  I love every single song.  They basically brought back the energy that was lacking from Second Helping and made sure to keep the songwriting abilities firmly intact as well.  When you combine energy with good songwriting, and hardly any radio exposure (except for one song) you're left with a very underrated album.    \\"Saturday Night Special\\" is interesting to me because it shows the band bringing back the energy and excitement from something on the debut such as \\"Gimme Three Steps\\" and also featuring a rather odd, but very memorable, chorus.      Now, here's where it gets interesting- some people think that's the only song on the album worth listening to, but guess what?  The next four songs are even BETTER than the opening song.  The guitar playing on \\"Cheatin' Woman\\" rules, and the vocals are very good as well.  \\"Railroad Song\\" should have been a hit, \\"I'm a Country Boy\\" almost reminds me of a southern rock version of Dire Straits, and \\"On the Hunt\\" is just a typical Lynyrd Skynyrd song, but I say that as a GOOD thing.    This is probably the best album Lynyrd Skynyrd ever made.  Better than the debut, and much better than Second Helping.  No filler in sight in my opinion.  I wish more bands were this consistently enjoyable.  A MUST own, even for people who might not dig southern rock a whole lot.  It's truly an underrated album.
B0012Q94QW|1.0|People, It took me all of 30 minutes into Independence Day to realize that Rolland Emmerich was a guy who was given way too much power and for absolutely ZERO reason. Terrible screenplays. Ridiculous storylines. Blown up scenarios to satisfy the popcorn popping crowd. Just stop. Stop. Studios... stop giving this guy money. People... stop supporting him.<br /><br />10,000 B.C. is a historical embarassment. Embarassing for Warner Bros. Studios, but I have no sympathy. They are the ones who sunk hundreds of millions into the waste of an opportunity that is Rolland Emmerich.<br /><br />Independence Day, Godzilla, Day After Tomorrow... and NOW the wooly mammoth disaster of all of them... 10,000 B.C.<br /><br />The studios haven't learned... they keep giving him opportunities that other, lesser known talents deserve... but the viewing audience is keen to his junk.<br /><br />Cavemen who talk. Cavemen who fashion elaborate weapons. Scenes ripped directly from Mel Gibson's APOCALYPTO. I could talk all day about the ridiculousness. It ain't worth my time.<br /><br />Emmerich preys on the stupidity of the public to stay afloat. Unfortunately for him, people have wisened up to him. At least this reviewer has. He won't get my money. Ever.
0385338724|4.0|Lexie isn't quite as lovable as Becky Bloomwood and I agree the story line isn't as original as the Shopaholic series (my favorite!) But still a great read. There are some great characters and wait till you find out what \\"MontBlanc\\" really is! I highly recommend this for a perfect summer beach book.
B000H2MTUA|5.0|It takes a masterful storyteller to make readers laugh while detailing a story of oppressive poverty, chronic illness, despicable alcohol abuse and the death of three siblings.  But that's exactly what Frank McCourt does.  With straightforward, non-judgmental prose, the author weaves a tale of survival at the most elemental level, detailing the life of the McCourt family, an Irish Catholic clan struggling to make it in poverty-stricken Limerick, Ireland, in the 1930s.  To describe the McCourts' life as 'miserable' doesn't do it justice.  Yet somehow, through the misery, this amazing author is able to find laughter, joy, irony and hope.  Don't let the depressing setting fool you.  This might be the most uplifting memoir I've ever read--and one of the best. [[ASIN:1592993052 Salmon Run]]
B000002P74|4.0|The follow-up to the groundbreaking debut is pretty good as far as songwriting and memorable songs go.  It doesn't match the energy of the debut, and falls short of what a follow-up album should be like in some areas, but overall, not a bad album by any means.      This despite having the classic \\"Sweet Home Alabama\\" (not really one of my favorites though) be the lead off song, and also containing the southern blues boogie \\"Call Me the Breeze\\".  Also \\"Don't Ask Me No Questions\\" is almost a pop rock song mixed with southern rock, and I love the way they were able to mix the two styles together and make it good.  Another song done in the same style, and perhaps the most underrated song on the album, is \\"The Needle and the Spoon\\".  The guitar playing is excellent on this song.    Then you have the very average attempt to recreate \\"Tuesday's Gone\\" called \\"I Need You\\" (not related to the Beatles song).  \\"The Ballad of Curtis Loew\\" is a very blantant attempt to copy the Band, but they just weren't able to make it as interesting as the majority of the classic Band songs.  However, another good song is \\"Workin' for MCA\\".  This song has a FANTASTIC beat and a really pleasant surprise to me personally.  \\"Swamp Music\\" is pretty solid as well.      So yeah, it's a good album, but the band shouldn't have put a couple of the songs on the album.
0375842209|5.0|I confess that this book sat on my shelf for weeks before I was able to read it. I was afraid it would be dark and disturbing, since it is narrated by Death.<br /><br />Finally I decided that almost 300 positive reviewers on Amazon could not be wrong, so I started it - and could not stop until I finished it the next day, taking a break only to sleep. The narrator turns out to be, as in the title of this review, surprisingly gentle and compassionate.<br /><br />I'm so glad that I did finally read it. You will be too, whether you're a \\"young adult\\" or 50-something like me. If the mark of great literature is the way its message expands your world-view and its characters make a home in your heart, this  is great literature. Read it.

0143038419|5.0|What a shame that so many readers failed to appreciate the beauty of this book.  It's possible that to connect with the author's experiences and words, one must be in a place to allow themselves to be drawn to G-d through her journey of self-discovery.  She is neither selfish nor self-absorbed; she's a woman on a mission to raise her consciousness and learn to still her constant negative messages so as to hear the voice of G-d.  Her writing is colorful and drew me in from the first chapter.  She's witty, intelligent and honest.  She admits to her short-comings, her guilt and her need to stop being a \\"cross between a golden retriever and a barnacle.\\"  I underlined, dog-eared and flagged this book.  I cried several times, touched by her insights.  I plan on giving this book to all my friends.  Be open to the voice of G-d or whatever you name your higher power when reading this book.  Realize that the author never, ever says she is a perfect person.  Quite the contrary.  And for those who chastize her decision to leave her husband, she realized how she was failing him and she let him go to be who he needed to be and so she could be who she was . . . so both could reach their potential.  Thank you, Elizabeth Gilbert.  I will re-read this gem often.

6303921248|5.0|Recently, I had watched the first four episodes on PBS and knew, because of a scheduling conflict, I would miss the last two segments. Lucky, I was able to order the complete set on Amazon and finish this wonderful Jane Austen tale. Plus, I will now be able to watch the entire series from start to finish, whenever I choose.

B000TGJ7ZY|5.0|Bram Stoker's Dracula is a legend. In 1992 a new movie based on the story of Bram Stoker arrived. I wanted to bad to watch it on the movies but I was too young to be allowed to do it. That movie became my most beloved movie of all time. I purchased this one on any available format, but even on DVD, something was missing. There were no bonus materials, no deleted scenes, no making of, nothing. 15 years passed and all my hopes were almost lost. But the Collector's Edition came, and it was everything I could ask for. Splendid material. This time, the \\"Collector's Edition\\" is true; not just a cheap marketing cheat, like so many times.  Besides, on Blu-ray format you have everything in one disc instead of the two disc set of the DVD format.  This is the ultimate Bram Stoker's Dracula edition and an absolute must have.
B00005JPXY|1.0|I was totally psyched to see this movie at the theaters, I went the opening weekend.  Should have listened to the reviews.  I could deal with the hand held camera, though it really got to some.  What made this movie a total bust was the plot.  It was slow to begin with, but when the action started it picked up.  However it doesn't give you anything! Where the monsters came from, if they were destroyed, how they were destroyed... nothing.<br /><br />The only plot it follows through on is the romance.  That plot was old and tired, same old, same old.<br /><br />Oh yea, the thing I hated most: Everyone dies!  I'm not exaggerating.  I mean everyone in the movie.  Not only that, one girl is bitten by the smaller monsters, she begins vomiting and so the military hauls her away yelling that she's been infected.  They never explain what the infection is, what it does to the host.<br /><br />Unless you like to make up your own stories, don't go see this one.
B000002KAG|5.0|i've never forgotten this album. this was the year i discovered myself thru the haight ashbury scene. i was a freshman in h.s. and i was going with Amy. we played the Grateful Dead,Surrealistic Pillow, Rubber Soul, Moby Grape, Country Joe & the Fish. every time i listen to any of these, i get a flash-back right to that wonderful time. the Grateful Dead, especially brings me back. a well made & fast party album.
B00005JMEW|5.0|The Good Things<br />*Excellent action and fighting.  Lots and lots of blood.<br />*Good story laid out in a very interesting way.<br />*Excellent group of characters.  You can really feel for most of them.<br />*Visuals and filming style is smooth, clear, and vivid.<br />*Impressive use of different medias to achieve unique effects (color film, black and white film, and animation).<br />*Dialogue, even though limited, is fun.<br />*Interesting music.<br />*Lots of homage to westerns, kung fu, and anime.  These elements are blended together to make a very unique picture.<br /><br />The Bad Things<br />*The extreme violence scared me away at first (but once you're used to it, it's all quite fun).<br />*Some disturbing parts (but this can be a good thing, because it makes the film edgy).<br />*Some absurd, unrealistic parts (but this can be a good thing too, because it makes the film stylish and fun).<br /><br />Despite being one of the bloodiest movies I know, it has become one of my all-time favorites.  The style of it is smashing; even when there is no action, the movie is very immersive.  I've come to appreciate the characters and the story, in addition to the vivid style.  Highly reccomended to anybody who likes martial arts or action in general, and doesn't mind some blood.
B000YPUFA6|4.0|This is one of those movies that can be described as awesome, and it really is. The point here is that you really have to be a hardcore fan to enjoy it. Being the third chapter in the series, it's important to have previous knowledge of the story; although, in this one, sereval changes can be found. The dark landscapes of Raccoon City and the interiors of certain buildings are exchanged for open and enormous settings in a ruined Las Vegas, and in daylight!! It's important to say that this is not a trilogy, the final sequence is an open door for the next film.   The prettiest thing is to see the lovely Milla Jovovich doing her stuff; and of course, in glorious HD, is a poem for the sight.   Highly recommendable for Resident Evil fans.
B0013FBS20|5.0|I love the Dawn of the Dead movies and I am a huge Will Smith fan (since the Fresh Prince), so I loved this show.  I thought the advertising was pure genius; no one had a clue that it was a zombie flick.  The only issue I had was the ending.  I won't spoil it for you, but I prefer happy endings and it wasn't necessary for it to end that way.
B0000DZEE3|5.0|This is a 5 star dvd in every aspect.  The performance is incredible, the production of the dvd is perfect and the quality of the video/audio is superb.  The dvd is in widescreen format and has Dolby 2.0/5.1 surround, and DTS 5.1 surround.  I have seen and owned many concert dvds and this one has no equal.  I have a 32\\" HDTV and a cheap surround sound system and I still feel like I'm at the show every time I watch this.  If you even remotely like the Chili Peppers do yourself a favor and see what a real concert dvd should look like.
B00005JMUA|5.0|The Good Things<br />*Some good action and fighting.<br />*Some good visuals.  Still a smooth and clear picture.<br />*Still a good story, with a very good conclusion.  Also fills in lots of gaps from the first film.<br />*Still an excellent group of characters that you can relate to.  It is especially interesting to see Bill for the first time.<br />*Dialogue is strong and interesting.<br />*More interesting music.<br />*Lots of homage to westerns, kung fu, and anime.  These elements are blended together to make a very unique picture.<br /><br />The Bad Things<br />*It's longer and there's much less action.<br />*Still has some absurd, unrealistic parts (but this can be a good thing, because it makes the film stylish and fun).<br /><br />This is a definate must-see for anybody who has seen the first film.  All of the missing story elements are present, and brings everything into clarity.  The conclusion is excellent (even if there is no fighting).  I don't think this is as stylish or exciting as the first film, but it is definately worthwhile to see the complete story.
B000BF0D9M|5.0|My first CD by this artist, and I bought it after attending a live performance.  I love the work, it takes me back to southern Europe - a place I love to go.
B000WCBMA8|4.0|The Hives took again a very long time to come up with new material after 2004's \\"Tyranossaurus Hives\\" album, the band's third album (after 1997's Barely Legal and 2000's Veni Vidi Vicious albums), but in Fall '07 the most impeccably dressed Swedish rockers finally return with a new album.<br /><br />\\"The Black and White Album Album\\" (14 tracks, 45 min.) starts off with a blasting \\"Tick Tick Boom\\" and we're off to the races. The first third of the album is impeccable, as one rousing track after another follows, all the way through track 5 (\\"Hey Little World\\"). Then a curious thing happens: a short instrumental interlude on organ (\\"A Stroll Through Hive Manor Corridors\\"), signaling the beginning of the next chapter on this album, and strangely from there on, the album becomes a hit-and-miss proposition: \\"T.H.E.H.IV.E.S.\\" works great, but \\"Giddy Up!\\" misfires badly; \\"Square One Here I Come\\" and \\"Puppet On A String\\" are unremarkable, but \\"Return the Favour\\" and the closer \\"Bigger Hole to Fill\\" are tops, the latter a very nice way to close things off.<br /><br />In all, \\"The Black and White Album\\" is not bad, but in comparison to the other albums the Hives have released so far, it is the weakest, as in: least remarkable, album to date. Then again, these are the Hives, and so this is better than 90% of what's being released these days, so it's all relative. I was supposed to see thed Hives in concert a couple of weeks ago, but due to illness regretfully had to miss it. I hope it's just a matter of time before I can hopefully see these guys live at some point!
B000XFVIMQ|1.0|Warner messed up the video coding on this disc.  The output is 1080 i not 1080 p as indicated on the specs.  The disc has been repressed and was re-released under a new UPC/ASIN number.  The release date on the new one is 2-26-08.  Buy that one, not this one.
B000VWYJ86|5.0|Even though the story has nothing to do with the original storyline in Ludlum's book, the third Bourne movie does justice to the character and the series. There are a few minor irritating plot points, but overall it's great. Lots of the action we expect and a good filling in of Bourne's backstory. Enjoy!
B000WCDI5K|5.0|CD was okay...nothing like their last albums.  Liked their take on Shadowplay but I love New Order, so that was kinda a given.  The Brightside remix wasn't bad either.
B00005JPLW|1.0|I have to admit that i am a bit behind on the times, because i just got around to watching this \\"movie\\". I had read the graphic novel, and it was amusing I suppose, Not a big fan of Miller or the movies based on his works.<br />300 really made my evening, seriously, I havent laughed that hard at a movie in years, well laughed that hard at a movie that isnt supposed to be funny. I get that its not supposed to be \\"realistic\\" in either looks or acting or backround but it quite campy and super simplistic and seriously over the top. Xerxes, oh how i wish i could just put him in my closet and open it up and make him talk to me, maybe sing a showtune or two!!!<br />I love Gerard, but he doesnt make the best choices when it comes to roles. I will forgive him for this one, perhaps he just needed to get into shape.
B000PFU7OO|5.0|Love it, love it, love it!  The movie was great, the cd was great, seeing them live was great...but meeting them was even better!

B000002OVJ|2.0|The Who were a great band.  To be precise, they were definitely one of the top three or four British beat groups of the Sixties.  Pete Townshend wrote great pop songs (as long as he was depressed by the size of his nose) and they delivered them with fire and flair.  But then, by means of a combination of drugs, alcohol and transcendental meditation, Pete became reconciled to his nose and the band fatally lost momentum.  It didn't help that he wasn't a very good guitarist.  A superb riff-maker, which is a major gift in itself, but not someone you can trust to carry you through an extended live jam with a ceaseless flow of musical invention.  (The phrase 'ham-fisted' comes to mind.)  Meanwhile, the rest of the band ('this ****ing sausage machine' as Pete once called them an in interview) were all full-on monsters of mayhem, but were equally little-known for their subtlety and sparkling imagination.  When in doubt, they riff like mad and hope that nobody will notice that it's still the same song.    The unfortunate result of this combination of factors is that 'Live at Leeds' has a reputation far in excess of its listenability.  I've gone through two copies now; the second one I got recently, just to see if it was still as boring in its extended edition as it was when it was just an audio cassette.  The answer is yes.  This is an album that I just cannot listen to all the way through, and I have an appetite for noise and sonic devastation, from Hendrix and Sonny Sharrock to Black Flag and Sonic Youth.  The problem is that The Who live were just...boring.      The shorter songs are fine, but somewhere in the middle of the 15-minute (!) version of 'My Generation', the eyelids start to droop.  Townshend's gifts as as a composer are at their strongest when writing hits, which is why the best Who albums are compilations.  Live, he and his mates could think of no better way to hold the audience's attention than to turn up louder than anyone else, which was far from the mostinspired way to do it.    I foresee that my CD of 'Live at Leeds' will, like its tape cousin, sit on the shelf unplayed until I either sell it or give it away.  The meat-&-potatoes tedium of their live assault has once again not done it for me.

B0010YSD7M|3.0|I've been a Stargate Fan since the first movie, and loyally throughout all 10 seasons over both cable networks it was carried on.  Stargate: Ark of Truth is a fun ride, a step up from the weekly show, but a disappointment in complete lack of story originality.    In this story, (AN EXACT CLONE OF THE REPLICATOR DEFEAT EPISODE IN SEASON 9) SG-1 discovers yet another ancient artifact that will destroy the nearly un-beatable near-omnipotent foe.  Exactly as they defeated the replicators with Bal's help in season nine, with a convenient 'link' between all Stargates and this Ancient weapon, the Replicators were wiped out in a single stroke, all over the galaxy with a coded entry on an old stone control pad.    Guess what happens at the end of this movie?  Well, without revealing everything, a convenient 'link' to all the ((blanks)) from an old stone/metal tablet Ark, wipes out all ORI believer's faith in one stroke once the critical coded pattern is stuck on the device.  ORI defeated, as quickly and as unbelievably neatly as the replicators were way back when.    Even more lackluster, the ORI \\"were killed\\" and not just wounded by the device sent to kill them in the latter part of Season 10 where Daniel Jackson was a Prior deceiving old evil Audra.  So, no better complexity of the Ancients versus the ORI, and how humanity can step in and fight is ever really explored.  We'll just leave Jackson a new ancient buried wonder-device to take care of it in the end.  With all of these perfect weapons laying around the universe in piles of desert dust, how in the world did the Wraith ever cause the ancients a sweat?  The ancients could not have found all of this stuff when they needed it?  Puhleeze!    Audra does little more than dance around in fiery steps, brag on about having all of the power, and wastes what could have been a nice scary scene with Claudia Black.  Julian Sands has a cup of coffee as the head prior, and then does nothing.  I was hoping for a bit more battle withthe heavyweights!    The movie is fun, tosses in the predictable IOA manic official with poor judgment and an even poorer dialogue, but a terminator replicator he becomes, and of course Ben Browder will survive about 15 steel pounding hits without dying or being rendered inert.  The logic behind the IOA  guy's story for intentionally risking everyone's lives is silly, not even political paranoids could or would get away with his access and security passes.    We get some more astounding Canadian scenery, which is okay, the special effects are good, and the humor and dramatic elements are nicely brief and poignant for a change, so the movie moves well if the story lacks for any originality.  Oh my, IRONY, with ORI and ORIGIN, you get NO ORIGINALITY.  That point sticks with me badly I'm afraid.    The cast is sharp, but sadly, there is no pickup of Jackson's and Vala's destined romance, only Beau Bridges gets to deliver what is expected, and Tealc' is in good form.    I was shocked that I really did enjoy the show, about 2 hours 10 minutes of no boredom, but later as I rummaged the tale through my head, remembering it was little fun, so much potential missed, and a story completely cloned in the conflicting elements exactly to the old formula of beating the replicators, a similar track was used in older SG-1 episodes too.  Let's hope Stargate Atlantis does not suffer from such story redundancy and writer's laziness.  This copy-cat story transfer was a true shame, hope this writer did NOT GET PAID!  Adding in Replicators is a transparent attempt to boost cheap excitment levels and raise kids hands cheering, but leaves any mature Sci-Fi senses flat on the deck of the Odyssey swimming in that replicator shrapnel.    Most of us could have written a far better screenplay.  This was not bad at all, it is fun SG-1 show, worth the time, but the end-all story to a huge build-up from the past 3 seasons, had no merit, honor or punch in the end.  Its a feel-good send-off to allSG-1 fans, but only if you're VERY generous on forgetting that they've done this to you time and time again.    The actors and the show deserved a better ending to the ORI storyline!  [...]
B00005214X|4.0|I got the original incarnation of this album (3 vinyl LPs) on my sixteenth birthday, about a week after it hit the record stores. I then bought the two CD set immediately upon its release, as this has always been, and remains, one of my favorite albums of all time.  I have yet to purchase this third version for a couple of reasons:  1) I HATE the colorization of the original sepia-toned cover photo, and 2) the order of the songs has been re-arranged with additions of demo covers of some of the orginal songs.  I'm generally not that much of a purist about 'bonus tracks' added to other classic rock albums, but this one is truly sacred to me on a number of levels, and I can't bring myself to fork over the $25 for it for those reasons.       Otherwise, and especially for those new to Harrison's solo output, I highly recommend adding this edition to your music collection.  The first 18 tracks (17 on the original set) comprise some of the most uplifting, finely-crafted, brilliantly produced rock & roll songs that have ever been recorded.  The lyrics are insightful, spiritual, and poignant throughout.  And George's unmistakable slide-guitar playing, along with his soulful vocals make this collection of songs among the finest pop music you'll ever hear.  And for those who think this is just a Hare Krishna revival meeting set to rock music, there's what was originally known as the \\"Apple Jam\\" LP: four instrumental tracks of some of the best rock musicians of the era (or any subsequent one) jamming out together, having fun and showing their stuff to perfection.       So, while I regret the changes made to the original, this is still a gold mine of a set and worthwhile for both hard-core Beatle/Harrison fans and new listeners alike.  Hopefully, I will one day overcome my sentimental attachment to the original format of this recording and purchase this edition in the spirit of the title song.

B00133MKVK|4.0|Dame Shirley was tempted back into the recording studio by the bond-esque \\"The Living Tree\\" and now we have this (almost) great album. The title says it all and the party has started for all of Dame Shirley's fans, new and old. The remixed tracks are based around vocals recorded in the 80's and 90's so sound superb. Dame Shirley really puts her own stamp on tracks like \\"I Will Survive\\" which is as far removed from the Gloria Gaynor version as you could imagine. Remixes of \\"I Who Have Nothing\\" and \\"Big Spender\\"  take them into the 21st century. Cagedbaby's remix of \\"This Is My Life\\" is as cool as ice!. A couple of the remixed tracks don't quite work but who could forget Shirley's version of \\"Get The Party Started\\"? It's going to be a great party! Don't miss out!

B0000AZJXQ|5.0|I think this album spoiled me.<br /><br />When Mer De Noms (2000) was released, I went to it with open arms because of its TOOL connection, but came out with folded arms, and an unsatisfied feeling. \\"3 Libras\\", \\"Judith\\", \\"Thinking of You\\", the production, the music and the playing had a fan in me, but to my ears it was all a little 'too' Tool. It felt like a thing to fill the gap between Tool albums. Not for Keenan. For me, as a listener. \\"3 Libras\\" I thought to be one of the best songs of that year, and hearing 'this side' of Keenan was refreshing and interesting. His vocal talents were never more appreciated until hearing A Perfect Circle's 1st album.<br /><br />I bought \\"Thirteenth Step\\" on Vinyl LP, because I prefer vinyl. :).<br /><br />\\"Thirteenth Step\\", to me, was miles beyond the first album. I was literally stunned, because here, A Perfect Circle had found their own sound, their own vision it seemed. A totally different album to their debut, with more textures and atmospheres, experimentation and depth. I sat back, only getting up to change the LP sides. When I got to \\"Pet\\" I had to listen to it 3 or 4 times in a row. Eyes lit up. Ears tingled. I have to say I have listened to this song at least 5 times a week since 2005, but not on Vinyl ;).<br /><br />And in accordance, \\"Thirteenth Step\\" still regularly rotates as CD's do in my player to this day. The album is 5 years old, I've owned it for 3 of those years, and I still think this is an almost perfect album. It just has so much going for it in the songwriting, the sound and production, and the level of musicianship going into it. And A Perfect Circle had found their own sound. You would think because Keenan was singing it, it automatically would sound like Tool. But that wasn't the problem for me with Mer De Noms. To me, a lot of it sounded like Tool. Too much, but just 'lighter' in execution. Not a crime at all. Just left me waiting for another Tool album.<br /><br />\\"Thirteenth Step\\" actually accomplished the reverse with me. When Tool's \\"10,000 Days\\" was released, I expected Tool to almost follow suit with A Perfect Circle, drastically changing their sound or how they do the things they do. And I have given \\"10,000 Days\\" multiple listens since its release. And I keep going back to \\"Thirteenth Step\\". It's not fair to compare the way different artists do the things they do, but at the same time, A Perfect Circle's second effort was leaps and bounds beyond their first. \\"10,000 Days\\" seemed like it was a step back to something before \\"Lateralus\\". And it left me feeling a little uneasy about the gaps in time between Tool albums, and .. well ... yeah. It's Tool, so you can't fault them truly. Constructively you can criticise the effort, but knowing full well that bands like Tool are completely rare and should be appreciated no matter what they do, because what they put into it is often miles beyond what is chosen 'acceptable' in music culture.<br /><br />Favourites have to be \\"The Package\\", \\"Pet\\", and \\"The Noose\\". But it's an album worth buying for the piece as a whole, for the sum of its parts added together.<br /><br />One of my favourite albums of recent years.10,000 Days\\" was released, I expected Tool to almost follow suit with A Perfect Circle, drastically changing their sound or how they do the things they do.

B000VR824S|5.0|Outstanding, super, great, fun - what else can I say?  We really enjoyed it - so much so that we purchased two of them for gifts.
B000UNYJXQ|5.0|I've really become skeptical of the extent to which films can affect change.<br /><br />Heres what we should do:<br /><br />(I'm assuming YOU are not a Right-wing dummy, blinded by hate of Micheal Moore and hopelessly ignorant about how our economic system and politics hurt the American people. \\"The market\\" doesn't solve everything. Quite the contrary.)<br /><br />OK. After watching this documentary your going to feel upset. And you should. If you don't feel anything -- immediately make an appointment to see a doctor. A shrink actually. Because you might be a sociopath. Well, if your like a shockingly large number of Americans, nevermind. You ain't got the money to see a shrink and even if you have health insurance in all probability your not covered. Good luck.<br /><br />After watching this film, get other people to watch it. Watch it with other people and talk about it.<br /><br />And then TAKE ACTION. Do something. Do many things if you have the time after working your butt off all day.<br /><br />Micheal Moore made a great film. It's arguably even his best. His role is to spread the word and reveal the ugly, dysfunctional, mean, dark side of America. And he does his job well and in personal and entertaining fashion. The thing is, all the great documentaries you watch, and articles and books you read, don't add up to nothing if all we do is sit around and whine about it.<br /><br />So, get up and do something. Write Congress. Support candidates that will work to change things. Support groups and organizations that are working to change the health care system in America anyway you can. And we should see what we can do in our private life helping out neighbors and folks in our city that do not receive adequate care that would otherwise help them to lead a more healthy and dignified life. I don't mean to preach, but \\"Sicko\\" was in the theaters and is out on DVD, it got a nod from the Academy, and so what?
B00005JNS0|4.0|I normally don't like animation movies, but this one was great.  Enjoyed the music and the animation was good.  It was funny and very enjoyable.  Great movie for the family and kids only.
B000XCZGVI|1.0|First, my rating.  The format 1 star, the original film, 5 stars.<br /><br />The theatrical version of the film released on the original DVD was incredible.  Jake Gyllenhaal's performance should have been recognized by the Oscar committee along with Robert Downey, Jr.. but of course the politics there are an entire different subject.<br /><br />The big question now.. why release it HD DVD format.  I know they had planned for that,  but that plan was before the format died and Toshiba ceased manufacturing the machines and now you can pick one up for less than $50 dollars most places.  Why not give it the HD treatment it deserves and a population of people with blu-ray players that would buy it without thinking twice.<br /><br />This has no sense to it.  There are no future releases scheduled for HD DVD's on any of the pre-release sites, yet here we have an incredible director's cut of a movie most people will never see.  Very SAD.<br /><br />The most interesting piece of trivia in this whole BR vs HD DVD saga... Toshiba has now made a deal with Sony to make chips for Sony's Playstation and blu-ray players.  Wasn't this the company recently aligned with Microsoft in the HD DVD market?????
B0014Z4OQG|5.0|Cloverfield is not only one of the best movies of the 2000's...it's one of the best of all time.<br />It takes concepts from other movies like 'Blair Witch' and cranks them up to '11'. It's a breakthrough in film presentation that will not be surpassed for some time (if ever).<br />Ignore any whiny complaints about dizziness or motion-sickness and just enjoy the movie.
B0010YSD7M|4.0|I'm going to open with a politically charged statement but bear with me since I'm trying to make a sense.  BABYLON 5 and STARGATE SG-1 both have some pretty fanatical fans.  As a television series, I think BABYLON 5 was much the better of the two.  It took greater risks in its storytelling and did more to develop the possibilities of television SF.  On nearly every level, B5 was the more substantial show.  Nonetheless, most of the B5 movies simply were not very good.  STARGATE SG1: THE ARK OF TRUTH is, on the other hand, very good indeed.<br /><br />Of course, one reason the movie is so good was because a number of important plot threads were left unresolved.  Gestures had been made toward the resolution of the Ori story, but it certainly hadn't been completed.  And I loved the fact that the series finale was devoted not to plot resolution but to spending time with the main cast members.  It was a very satisfying, relatively unambitious series finale.  But since the main appeal of the show had always been the main group of characters, it was completely appropriate.  ARK OF TRUTH managed to very satisfyingly wrap up the Ori story.<br /><br />I suppose any individual might find reason to complain about one or other aspect of the film.  I always enjoy more rather than less Daniel Jackson, but here he didn't get as much of a hand in the story as usual.  I also really love a lot of Vala, especially when wearing nice midriffs, but as Claudia Black was pregnant during the filming of the film that wouldn't work.  I'm not sure precisely how pregnant she was, but let's just say she got to wear a lot of body armor in this one.<br /><br />We not only got a resolution to the Ori arc, but we got to revisit our friends the Replicators.  Always got to love the Replicators.<br /><br />This movie historically could prove to be of considerable importance, for good or ill.  Studios have been struggling with the whole idea of direct to DVD movies.  They are aware that there are several shows that have a cadre of extremely dedicated fans.  The question so far has been how to take advantage for the studio of this core group of fans in a way that satisfies the fans and makes business sense for the studios.  The main show in this regard has been FIREFLY.  Although cancelled after only 11 episodes were broadcast (though others were made), the series became one of the steadiest selling series in the history of television.  But here is where the story gets complex.  Turning FIREFLY into the movie SERENITY proved a box office disaster, with the movie failing to make back its costs.  But then once again the story gets complex.  SERENITY became a significant profit maker due to its DVD sales, to the point where a new and expanded DVD was released, which continues to sell well.  Now Universal is contemplating a second SERENITY movie.  But here is the dilemma.  Do they make another regular theater release film?  Or do they just go direct to DVD?<br /><br />This is why STARGATE -- THE ARK OF TRUTH is so important.  If its sales are good and make a profit for the studio (also, there is a second STARGATE coming out this summer), then it could encourage other studios to take a risk with direct to DVD movies.  If both the STARGATE movies make money, then we might not only see SERENITY 2 (different studio, but this is something the industry is watching) but other beloved shows continue through direct to DVD productions.<br /><br />So keep your fingers crossed!  Better yet, go buy a copy of the movie.  If this movie does well, we all stand to benefit not merely by additional STARGATE films, but other films and shows as well.mely dedicated fans.

B000Q6GX5Y|5.0|Sparta, Lacedaemonian city state in the southern Greek peninsula. The year was 480 B.C.  It was the Classical age... a savage age... a golden age. An age when men were Real Men, women were Real Women, and politicians were vile, lascivious, treacherous, narcissistic... OK, so the politicians haven't changed much.    The movie \\"300\\" is an adaptation of comic artist Frank Miller's graphic novel of the same name. It tells the story, albeit in a fanciful way, of one of the greatest battles in history. The Battle of Thermopylae is taught in nearly every military academy and military history class in the world for both its military and its moral virtues. On the one hand, it is an excellent example of the benefits of training and discipline, and of the excellent tactical use of terrain. On the other hand, it is a shining example of dedication and sacrifice, of free men volunteering to give their lives to protect their homeland, their people, and their way of life.    At the Battle of Thermopylae (greek for Hot Gates, because of the tight passages and hot springs), 300 Spartans, including the Spartan King Leonidas, and a few thousand other Greek soldiers fought the invading army of the Persian emperor Xerxes, which some estimates put at over two million strong. By the third day of battle, most of the other Greeks withdrew and only the Spartans and a few hundred others remained. The Spartans died to the last man to give the other Greek city states time to mount defenses strong enough to hold against the remainder of Xerxes' army.    The Greek poet Simonides of Ceos (556 BC-469 BC) engraved an epitaph for the 300 Spartans on a stone at the site of the battle. It reads \\"Go tell the Spartans, stranger passing by, that here, obedient to their laws, we lie.\\" This passage is considered by scholars to be among the noblest phrases ever uttered by man. It does not ask for glory or accolades, only that they be remembered as soldiers who did their duty.    The movie \\"300\\" is not the most historically accurate depiction of this famous battle. There were no elephants or rhinoceroses at Thermopylae. The movie's Xerxes looks like a Goa'uld from Stargate SG1, whereas the real Xerxes was more likely closer to Usama Bin Laden in appearance. Many other details were exaggerated and fantastical. However, the movie does get right the central points of sacrifice, heroism, honor, and love of freedom. The Spartans may have been brutal by today's standards, but they were free people living in a brutal world.    Also, many famous moments and phrases chronicled by historians, like \\"(Persian) arrows will blot out the Sun\\", \\"Then we shall fight in the shade\\", \\"Come and get them!\\", and the \\"Go tell the Spartans...\\" epigram are faithfully included.  Besides, the exaggerations and fantasy would have pleased the ancient Greeks who often idealized their heroes in plays, art, and literature.     The combination of history, heroism, and fantasy makes this movie a wild ride and a must-see.
0385338724|3.0|For those of you who are familiar with the Shopaholic series and have grown to adore her quirky characters you might be disappointed with this latest work. It has been a little while since we have seen a new book by Sophie Kinsella and in my opinion we still haven't. The great part of the Shopaholic series is that it is fun light reading with an ending you can see a hundred miles away but you love seeing how the girl will make it all work out.<br /><br />Remember Me? is much closer to the books by Madeleine Wickham. If you enjoyed Cocktails for Three and Gatecrasher this will be right up your ally. It is a bit more dark. The characters are not as instantly lovable and there is not a general, overwhelming feeling of happiness permeating the pages of the novel. It is a quick read that chronicles the life of a woman who is waking up with amnesia only to realize that she was never very happy and although she lived two separate lives, views both as a lie. The ending is far from the joyous, cute resolution offered up in the Shopaholic series.<br /><br />Decent read but certainly not the fun beach book for which I was hoping.
B000PKG7I4|5.0|And no, I don't mean her voice. I mean the way you can hear her voice get a little grittier with every drink and drug, just like Billie near the end of her life. Her vibrato was harsh and forced and she couldn't hold the notes like she once could. And I see that happening with Amy...especially when you listen to Frank and then hear her sing Back to Black.    And, no one realizes that there's a song by Amy Winehouse called \\"Know You Now\\" and it was originally on this album. It is by far my favorite and NO ONE KNOWS about it. It has a very jazzy tempo and it's really tasty.    In comparison to each other, Frank is way better than Back to Black. In comparison to other artists, Amy Winehouse is better...even when she's at her worst.    Also, the amazon.co.uk reviewer got the song and lyrics WRONG...the song that had the lyrics \\"you wouldn't want me to be lonely...\\" is \\"I Heard Love is Blind\\" NOT \\"F*** Me Pumps.\\"

B000NU2CY4|5.0|Gladiator is one of the best movies I have ever seen. I loved it from start to finish.
B00005Y6YB|5.0|One of the great Westerns, albeit this time on the small screen not the large, this is a movie about aging in a decent way.  As much as the characters age, this is also a pivotal time for the genre of the Western itself, predicting the rise of the revisionist Westerns (Dances with Wolves, Unforgiven et al) at a time when no-one was interested in Westerns at all.  As such, the message of growing old in the face of adversity while keeping values intact is striking and as relevant as ever.  So what makes it work?  First, the epic scope of Larry McMurty's book which fits 6 hours of television so much better than it would have squeezed into a theatrical movie.  It breathes, takes its time and introduces characters in what at first feels a long drawn out way, but as the series progresses we thank it for giving us this time to get to know them.  As the cattle drive that propels the characters and story forward proceeds North, the events genually matter to us, thanks to a pitch perfect script.  Then there is the acting - Robert DuVall will surely forever be Gus.. and Tommy Lee Jones was near unknown when he was picked for this role which he plays to perfection, especially in the final episode when he takes his hardest ever journey, back to Lonesome Dove.  Not just these two, but Danny Glover, Diane Lane, and smaller roles by Chris Cooper, D.B. Sweeney, Robert Urich and others all exist in three dimensions, and all serve to create a real picture of a cowboys lifestyle.  Not least, there is the cinematography and music, both of which complement each other by never being showy but existing to provide a perfect setting for this character study.  It might seem a tad long - I know I thought so when seeing it at a younger age, but certainly not now... so if its fast paced action you want, go elsewhere - but for an affecting and perfectly acted exploration of dignity, values, romance and courage, switch on and lose yourself in Gus and Woodrow's world.    Extras are rudimentary butquite effective.  Interviews with producer and McMurty on the genesis of the project are interesting, but would have been better served by being compiled into a documentary, as the poor sound and dull setting belie the value of what is being said.
184195392X|4.0|This book could be re-read, enjoyed and reflected upon in a variety of ways.  Firstly, as an adventure story - the gripping account of a shipwrecked lad in high seas sharing a small boat with a Royal Bengal.  Secondly, as a primer on realpolitik - on how to take a pragmatic view of things, work with meager resources and strange/powerful/ruthless companions - the compromises to make in order to achieve a superior goal.  Thirdly, as an inspirational guide - to face up to a seemingly hopeless situation, to keep the faith and persevere.  Lastly, as a spiritual parody - as we drift through life much the same way the boat does, yet retaining the dynamism of our human spirit as conveyed by the motion of the boat - and the lad and the Tiger essentially representing the dualism of our mind: man/beast, peace-loving/potentially violent, etc. - eventually arriving at the shore of self-realization - Not surprisingly Richard Parker, the beast departs immediately once the true lofty nature of human personality/spirit is revealed.  Well, I guess one could go on and on about this book in so many ways.  But regardless of your interests and perspectives I am sure you would enjoy it.
0452289963|3.0|With my PhD in Holistic Ministries, I've done a lot of studying about the ego. I would have never picked up this book except I thought it would help my husband since he's searching for his purpose (I'm referencing the subtitle of the book). He doesn't enjoy reading so of course, I had to read the book and do the Oprah/Eckhart class with him. I am in the last chapter and I have yet to get that \\"aha\\" I keep hearing about. The book is easy to understand in some areas and too confusing in others. I'm troubled that Eckhart has separated the self into only two entities: the ego (complaining, negative) and the real \\"you\\" (the stillness). Where is the discerning self? The part of you that helps you discern choices, makes plans, gives you direction. I am hoping the discussion between Oprah and Eckhart will reveal that information. I am, though, seeing progress in my husband. He suffered much abuse from his father and brother. I think he's finally getting past that. If it helps him, then the intent for reading the book and taking the class have been well worth it.<br />Carolyn Dargevics, [...]
080701429X|5.0|One of the best books I've read in my life. Recommend to everyone. Life will not be the same after you finish.
B0002EQ7E2|5.0|I bought the album in 1986. A few years later I bought the cassette for the car. I recently bought the cd. I still love every single song. Wow.
0385338694|4.0|When this book was published I avoided it. It's a bad habit of mine-I assume that any great character in a first person book will just be recycled if the author writes another first person novel. So after Shopaholic I just thought that if I read \\"The undomestic Goddess\\" I would be reading the thoughts of a diluted or slightly warped version of Becky Bloomwood from the Shopaholic series.    I was wrong. Very wrong. My sincere apologies to Sophie Kinsella for doubting her talents.     Samantha Sweeting is a high powered corporate lawyer about to make partner. She should be on top of the world but instead her nearly 100 hour work week, equally driven (some would say obsessed) family and absolutely no social life is dragging her down. So when the blessed announcement arrives that she has her dream job and moments later Sam finds out she has made a major mistake that could cost a client millions she panics. And ends up in a house in the country applying for a job as a housekeeper.    But Sam can't cook. Sam can't clean-and Sam has nowhere else to go.    Thankfully the handsome gardener, his lovely mother help her learn to be a true domestic goddess and her clueless but well meaning employers give her the praise she's been craving her whole life. But is this life, stumbled into my mistake and based on numerous lies, truly what she wants or does she crave a return to her old ways?    This is a great story about finding your true self, figuring out what you want (or at least what you need) to have a life you can not only live but you can enjoy. It's a great reminder that everyone should take a step back once in a while and make sure that what they want, what they're trying to get, is still really the thing they want. That they need, crave. I didn't like it quite as much as Shopaholic but it'll be getting a permanent place on my chick-lit bookshelf for sure.    Four point five stars.
B000FIMG68|5.0|Lost - The Complete Second Season is definitely my favorite so far. Season 1 and 3 are good but not as exciting like season 2. We finally discover what's in that creepy hatch and new characters are introduced (you will either love the new people or loathe them). My fave episode from this season is What Kate Did. More characters get killed off and some were sure surprises. I highly recommend this intriguing and addicting show, enjoy!
0441013597|5.0|Dune is one of the greatest books, not just science-fiction books, of all time. It is an epic story in which intergalactic fiefdoms vie for power under the cryptic mechanizations of the galactic Emperor.<br /><br />The story begins when House Atreides is granted stewardship of a desert planet that is the sole source of the spice m&eacute;lange. The spice is exceedingly important to the galaxy as it is used by the Spacing Guild in interstellar navigation and by the Bene Gesserit to extend their psychological powers. The empire cannot exist without space travel nor the Bene Gesserit's controlling influence. So, it cannot exist without the spice. The Atreides are immediately aware of this and the tenacity of their situation, especially with their rivals and the former custodians of Dune: House Harkonnen.<br /><br />All this is backdrop to the real story though: the plight of a young man named Paul Atreides heir to House Atreides. Paul is the son of the Duke Atreides and the Lady Jessica, a Bene Gesserit and bound concubine to the Duke. Sharing both his father's noble upbringing and his mother's special powers, Paul is quickly identified as a powerful future leader and potentially the messiah of ancient Bene Gesserit lore: the Kwisatz Haderach.<br /><br />When the Atreides are betrayed by the Emperor, who reveals his true allegiance to House Harkonnen, a gripping saga commences that challenges Paul to survive to avenge his family against an empire bent on destroying him.<br /><br />The entire Dune series is engaging and complete in its imagined universe that each book is a treasure in its own right. The first book however stands even above the rest as the fantastically imagined beginning to the legacy of Dune. It is a must-read for anyone.
B000J3EEBY|5.0|Bought this recording in 2007 upon its release; An Ancient Muse is an excellent work of art.  Although it was a long wait since her last release, it was well worth the wait.  I can't say enough positive about the music and the warmth it brings to the listener.  Among my 1,000 cd collection, it's one that I keep close to my player. I've got to say it's in my top 10 favorite cd's and will remain there for quite some time.  You won't be disappointed in buying this one.
B000N4SHOE|5.0|A Beautiful Story. Excellent watching.  Tells the story of the woman who wrote the Beatrix Potter Books for children (or adults).  Her stories were so real to her that even the animals took on the life of the story and were her really true friends.
B000FVQM2Y|5.0|Who says you need mega-dollar actors, special effects, and elaborate sets to create a compelling story? Writer/Director Rian Johnson managed to complete Brick for under $450,000. The utter brilliance of this film makes it difficult to even write about it, and every time I watch it I'm more intrigued with the characters. Joseph Gordon-Levitt really carries the film with his character Brenden's fearless quick-wit and carefully crafted lines. The whole cast, however, works together so well and the chemistry is as such that the exchange is so quick you really have to pay attention to catch all the wit. Johnson created this tale in the tradition of classic hard boiled detective stories the likes of The Maltese Falcon (even quoting this film), but placing the events in a suburban Southern Californian high school, giving this a unique modern edge. I don't really know if I can write anymore about Brick, you'll just have to discover this gem yourself.
B00000293E|5.0|How can you give Willie Dixon less than five stars? The man has played on some of the greatest blues recordings in history and he has written some of the genre's most memorable songs. Recorded in Chicago during the summer of 1969, the album only features one third of the material recorded in that session. The band featured Johnny Shines on guitar, Walter \\"Shakey\\" Horton on harmonica, Clifton James on drums, either Sunnyland Slim or Lafayette Leake on piano, and of course Willie Dixon on bass and vocals. If you're looking for instrumental flash, this is not for you. However, Willie's deep growl is pleasant, it has a great beat, and every single song is a classic!
B00001OH7P|5.0|It's definately been said about Bowie before, and I'm sure not going to be the last one to say it: but the man's a genius.  That genius is fully recognized in the powerful sci-fi scenes and emotions captured in his lyrics.  Even as he changes beat, tempo, and the overall feel of the songs from \\"Five Years\\" to \\"It Ain't Easy\\" to \\"Hang on to Yourself\\" to even the song that started it all \\"Ziggy Stardust\\" it's just so easy to get lost in the feel of the music.    One of the first Bowie CDs I've purchased, and one of the best buys I've ever made.
B00133KFGW|5.0|What a rush - whosh, I loved it.  That director Kirsten Sheridan used the chemistry of the actors to draw the viewer into the movie.  The music spins around you and you are captivated into the story.  The sadness, the flame of hope that boy has that just won't burn out. That's what I call entertainment when for the 113 minutes run time I forget everything else but the movie.  Much like settling down with a good book.  My thanks to all who made that movie possible.
B00001OH7O|5.0|This album really is second to none when it comes to David Bowie as a pop artist.  I wouldn't really qualify some of these songs as \\"pop\\" but that's okay because I'm not a walking dictionary.    I fell in love with all of the songs on this album the moment I heard them.  \\"Oh, You Pretty Things\\" is a song that I can play over and over again and never get bored of because it's really THAT good.  Don't get me started on \\"Queen Bitch\\".  I'd give you all a detailed description of how much I love each of the songs on this album, but I don't have the time, so I shant.    On an overall note, however, the messages behind the songs in this album are just so raw, it's hard to take in over the course of one listening.  I'll find myself constantly going over the songs in my mind, discovering new things about them that I'd never noticed before.  Of course, I think that was kind of the point.
B000TKW3E2|5.0|This is well worth getting whether you've seen the movie or not.  Marianelli captures and builds on the melancholy serenity and yearning of a lull in a storm.  If the samples don't give you enough of an idea, think shades of the non-battle scenes of Gladiator and the Kenneth Brannagh Henry V.
B00157LYJ8|5.0|I discovered Jonas Kaufmann by accident searching the internet. What a wonderful surprise to hear a Tenor voice unlike any I have ever heard before. There are a couple of moments on this CD that are so wonderful I had to listen to them multiple times on my first hearing. The Manon and the Meistersinger arias are so musical and heart felt. His dark masculine sound threw me at first, but I love this album and I love his voice. I think we will hear much from him in the future.
047158651X|5.0|Vitalism is a profoundly science-ejected concept, though many CAM or 'natural health' cabals falsely claim that vitalism survives scientific scrutiny.<br /><br />I quote:<br /><br />\\"Pasteur assumed that living systems were endowed with a 'vital force' that permitted them to evade the laws of nature governing inanimate matter [p.333...but] Buchner demonstrated that cell-free yeast extracts [can carry out fermentation...] this discovery refuted the then widely held belief that fermentation, and every other biological process, was mediated by some 'vital force' inherent in living matter [p.444...] thermodynamics of life. One of the last refuges of vitalism, the doctrine that biological processes are not bound by the physical laws that govern inanimate objects, was the belief that living things can somehow evade the laws of thermodynamics [...] a view partially refuted by elaborate calorimetric measurements on living animals that are entirely consistent with the energy conservation predictions of the first law of thermodynamics [p.437].\\"<br /><br />-r.c.
B000A88EV4|2.0|This is an unfortunate film, actually. Although, mostly interesting it begins to grate upon one midway through.  Mike Leigh's strengths are his ability to demonstrate the 'lives' of working class britons with heaps of wit, charm, cleverness and bits of rather heavy-handed (tho not quite sappy) emotionalism.  He's best when he keeps it light overall whilst making one or two quite heavy points.  The problem with Naked is that it is all about heavy with very little light.  In addition, Mr. Leigh tries but fails to lade his tale with deep metaphorical meaning in the way that the rather hideously bad film The Thief, Cook, Wife and Lover did although without the fantasmagorical posturing, pretension, piffle and puck. In a nutshell this is the tale of a working class Mancunian who is either insane or being driven insane by the workings of his mind.  His problem is that he is too smart for his class (that's breeding, mind), which shows in his glib verbosity and abstruse philosophical riffs which he bundles up in clever entendre and verbal puns.  The problem is that he is speaking university to working class yobs and yobettes which causes him to be alienating and alienated to those he interacts with, rather assaults.  His failure, or inability to connect on a purely personal, human level further damaging his diseased mind which causes him to act out more and so on.  Mr. Leigh attempted to stir in a few different ingredients into his metaphorical stew but he fails to, for instance, demonstrate that the working class protagonist's angry, abusive manner is equivalent to the posh anti-heroe's equally angry abusive behaviour with the difference being only that one can afford to 'pay' for his rapine behaviour while the other must merely take his rapes for free.  I'm uncertain why Mr. Leigh brought that psycho-social angle into the story because he had enough semi-meaningless flux to deal with in the story as it is.  There are other random bits of disconnectedness that I shan't bother to comment upon.  To sum up, this is an interesting but unentertaining, non-thought-provoking movie that is worth watching if you are a big fan of Leigh's movies.her to comment upon.

0553381687|5.0|A quality book.  This novel involves a lot of character development and has a way of latching on to your imagination.  I can't wait to read the rest of the series and I am incredibly excited to here that the series might get picked up by HBO.
B0010YSD7M|5.0|The Ark of Truth is a very good DVD, the special effects are great the story is good and it ties up some lose ends, and leaves us knowing that there can be more. Stargate SG1 is an excellent series and I am sorry to see it come to an end on TV but at least we can now have a movie from time to time. Also with star gate we cannot know if this is part of a governmental program of disclosure, is disinformation, or just a TV show.
B00007K02F|4.0|If you are a hard core Jane Eyer fan (as I am) this movie may rub you the wrong way.  It does lack a few key scenes that were described in the novel, however, for pure entertainment it is good.  Do not watch this and expect a perfect rendition of the novel, but it is a well done and lovley movie.

B001041JLE|5.0|As a Michael Jackson fan since the age of two I was so thrilled to learn that Thriller was going to be re-released in a special 25th anniversary edition!!<br /><br />What I love about the special edition is that the original album is included on this disc. I never get tired of listening to Thriller!!<br /><br />These remixes are awesome!! My two favorite remixes are Wanna Be Startin Somethin featuring Will.I.Am & Akon this remix is new and fresh and up beat and I just love it!! My other favorite remix is the Billie Jean remix featuring Kanye West!! I love this remix because it is slow and sultry and I could just listen to to that remix all day!!<br /><br />I also love the Previously Unreleased song called For All Time. This is such a beautiful ballad that Michael sounds so beautiful singing I love beautiful ballads and I think the ladies will love this ballad as well!!<br /><br />Now I have to be honest here. The only thing I was disappointed with, with this special 25th anniversary edition is that I wish the whole album had been remixed to go along with the original album instead of a select few songs but, other than that I'm satisfied with this album and I think you will be to!!
0143113100|5.0|The knowledge contained in this book is transformative!     This book cannot be recommended too highly. It is simply very exciting science reporting, with many practical applications for anyone concerned with maintaining cognitive function, or who knows someone who suffers from learning disability, the aftereffects of stroke, etc., or getting older. In other words, there isn't anyone who will not benefit from reading this book.     The only caveat I have is that the author glosses over the abuse of animals in the chapter discussing the Silver Spring Monkeys. While the research discussed is of the first importance, there is no need to pretend scientists do not and have not often acted with a huge lack of humanity in carrying their research out. What's the point of denying it?  The book The mind and the brain by Schwartz and Begley has a more balanced reporting of these events.     This book has a clearer and more comprehensive coverage of cutting edge discoveries in nueroplasticity than does Schwartz and Begley, and is not encumbered by Schwartz' desires to prove he has discovered the fifth fundamental force of nature. It is truly a joy to read and the practical and intellectual ferment the book provides is exhilarating. My hope is that everyone will read this book and pass it one, especially to professionals involved -- in any capacity -- in rehabilitative medicine, psychology, or education.

B000R6PKP2|4.0|When i first saw the Blade Runner portfolio i was amazed, all the movie iterations with a rare seen workprint version, and all the bells and whistles, but when i recived the package i was dissapointed, the case is a plastic one not aluminum, the origami figuirine is plastic, the spinner miniature is plastic, all the cool stuff is plastic cheap plastic, the movies are ok, we all known blade runner so i can't be dissapointed by the movies, so the reason why i buy this item is all the cool stuff, and for $64+ bucks i hoped it has some quality, the signed personal letter is just a litography, so ...<br />you might say, \\"hey, it's just $64\\", and yes it's just $64 and i want some quility for my money, not just some cheap plastic stuff with some pictures on it to pay it like if that was a craftsman work.<br /><br />The movie quality is remarcable, for a movie that is 25 years old it's a fantastic and high quality restoration, the new scenes added by CGI are fine but just a little bit too fine for the rest of the movie, the new scenes looks fake, like an cartoonish inserption in the movie flow, but well, the movies rocks, the sound is pristine, i don't know abot THX, DTS, dolby truHD, DTS ES, ABC, DEFG.....<br />but in all, the sound still drives the movie, and the music is another great reason to remove the awful narration.<br /><br />My review isn't about a movie all the people interested in this pack has seen, but for the quality of this edition, and the quality of the included material is mediocre, the movie quality is great, the sound excellent, and the extras, well, i just can't get enough of Blade Runner, just love it.

B00005JPTK|5.0|Being a huge sci-fi fan, I naturally loved this movie!  And seeing it at a theater in Times Square gave it that extra special effect.  Is Hollywood ever dead on with the books they take to the big screen?  Hardly.  But if you approach the movie as if you've never read the Matheson novels, then you won't be disappointed with the director's vision and Will Smith's performance.  It takes work to convey emotion to an audience when you have no other actor to play off, especially in front of a green screen.    The only disappointment for me was to discover the DVD 2-disc special edition's Digital Copy is only Windows Media compatible.  [...]   Sorry iPod, iPhone, and Mac owners but this means, according to Warner Bros digital copy website, that it can only be legally transferred from the purchased DVD to a PC or PlaysForSure device.  Apparently, it's a technical and file size limitation.  I hope knowing that more than 20 million video iPods are out there, will influence them in adding that format to upcoming titles soon.
B0010358D0|5.0|I got this today and was surprised to find that there were no inserts in the DVD case. Not even a page with the track listing. There were clips in the case to hold inserts? The previous \\"Applseed\\" movie release, in the same deluxe two-disc format, had inserts (three in fact: a track listing that opened into a small poster; an add for the OST (Original Soundtrack); a feedback card from the distributor (Geneon). Did anyone actually get any inserts with this new realease? Thanks.
B000N6TYLW|4.0|I have all the seasons of Gilmore Girls so I had to get the last season but for me it was the most disappointing season, especially the ending. I felt like I was cheated. I just could believe it ended the way it did. I guess they meant to make the last scene like the beginning of the first episode. What I like about the DVD is the extras, but that's it.
B000N6TX1I|4.0|I wish I'd seen this at the movies, but the trailer made it seem so much like the usual pedestrian sci-fi nonsense that I blew it off.  Thank you very much Universal Publicity -- not.    Fortunately a friend forced the DVD on me.    I won't argue over the plot complexities -- there really aren't any: in a world that is rapidly winding down Clive Owen suddenly finds himself custodian to the first pregnant woman in eighteen years.    It's a chase movie, and in the hands of a less creative director this film would've given up in the first twenty minutes -- let's face it, the synopsis doesn't offer much hope for anything more than another \\"Equilibrium\\" style sci-fi action-fest.    But Cuaron manages to keep the story moving through what could esily be a series of predictable sequences with some spectacularly original camera work and beautifully understated performances.  He emphasises character and texture, and the hard work pays off.      Children Of Men is an excellent example of what a great director can do with some ordinary material.  Cuaron's dystopia is Bosnian: grey skies, crumbling infrastructure, and ethnic cleansing.  His long meandering camera moves are more like \\"The Red and The White\\" than anything SF cinema has produced; there are no sweeping establishing shots or dramatic futuristic vistas -- the camera literally walks through the carnage.  And while all the actors are good (usually great), the relationship between Julianne Moore and Clive Owen is just wonderful.    I won't argue about the originality of the story, but the treatment was so beautifully realised that I fell for this one in the first ten minutes.  The SF might have some shortcomings, but the emotional honesty -- and complete lack of sentimentality -- more than make up for it.
B000ZOXDFA|3.0|I was disappointed with this movie. The first one, Elizabeth, was so much better. This was drawn out and really didn't go into all the events of the golden age. If my memory serves me right the daughter of the Spanish king, Philip, was not that young and the war scene did not occur as depicted in history. Even if the facts were not correct, it was not that entertaining.
0790734850|5.0|L.A. Confidential is Curtis Hanson's masterpiece. Overlook the flaws--especially the stereotypical characters--and see that it's all a part of the genre. The film noir does use stereotypes, and this movie takes that genre and makes it into a wonderful story of the gray between good and bad. There's the police thug who hates women beaters. There's the political good guy who won't compromise for anything. There's the gorgeous prostitute. There's the smarmy celebrity cop. There's even the loathsome smut-mag publisher. And none of them are quite what they seem. Each one changes over the course of the film, or we at least see a different side to every one of them.     It's watching these stereotypes develop (albeit in their generic ways) that makes this movie fun. That and the amazing shoot 'em up scene at the end. When the two protagonists make their final stand, you know it's coming, and it still keeps you on the edge of your seat. That's the sign of a good movie, and L.A. Confidential continues to deliver, even at a second and third viewing.

B0002VEPRQ|5.0|As a product of 60's Disney films, I purchased the DVD after my 8 year old son and 11 year old daughter went to see the Broadway production of \\"Mary Poppins\\".  The kids started watching it immediately and I loved listening to them sing my favorite songs from the movie.  Ten days later on a rainy Sunday we popped it in the DVD player as a family and watched it on the big HDTV in the living room.      I was amazed at the color, the skin tones and the digital remix of the score.  I felt just as excited as the first time I saw it,  was shocked at Dick Van Dyke's blue eyes, the creamy complexion of Julie Andrews and the sheer fun of this movie.    And my technie kids loved the story - \\"T'uPence never fails to make them sad about the pigeons at St. Mark's Square and I love that as a mother I'm sharing some of my own childhood.    PS - my son wants to be a chimney sweep!

B000I2J6K0|5.0|This is the only prenatal fitness DVD I have purchased and I am very happy with it.  It's a good 40-minute full body workout that you can do without any extra gym equipment.  I was pretty fit before getting pregnant (running marathons and biking) and ran up until the 5th month of my pregnancy.  Now I walk and do this video 3X a week and really feel like I've gotten a workout.  This video is great for anyone with a moderate to high fitness level.
B0012K1ILW|1.0|First I will say that I have all of badu's music even the live cd's. But what the hell is this. For the lady that said this was better then her last albulm, you must be on something to. I appreciate artist creative sides and wanting to have input in projects but I just don't get this one. It seems like she was on drugs when she made this cd. I listened over and over hoping it will come together, and nothing. Jill came hard, Angie Stone came even harder, I though that Badu was going to make it do what it do, but she made it do what it don't. I bought it because I support artist like badu, but it will defiently collect dust. Honey tricked people, because usually the first track is not the best song on the albulm, but Honey is the only song that makes sense, there may be 2 more, but thats it. All I say is be creative, but make good sounding music, not just for you but your fans that pay your bills. I still love badu, but can you say REHAB.
B00102FELM|1.0|Be careful. Had to return. Did not play on my DVD player or computer. The back cover said NTSC Region 0. However, the DVD said PAL Region 9. I could see the picture, but there was no sound. Wait for the US version!!
B000031EGV|5.0|Good movie and it does great--no flaws at all.    Thank you,  Lester A.Vineyard
B000YENUI6|5.0|Very enjoyable. Viggo Mortensen was very brave to take this part, in more ways than one. He plays the driver and enforcer to a Russian mafia boss in London, grim enough in itself, but he also has to take orders from the boss's loose cannon of a son, Kiril. Naomi Watts is solid as Anna Ivanova, the nurse who unwittingly attracts the attention of the head honcho, and Vincent Cassell is superb as the (suspectedly gay) erratic and pained disappointment of a son. He has so much promise. My Anglo-Ukrainian wife assures me the accents are quite good, too.<br /><br />Viggo was brave to do the 'tackle out' fight scene in the Turkish bath (flashing blades near exposed genitalia really made me wince), but it was very well done - though he could do with putting a few pounds on.<br /><br />All in all, a pretty good thriller, and the ending, though easily (wrongly) construed as inconclusive, leaves it a great opportunity for a sequel. If so, I hope they don't blow it. Good performances all round. Recommended.<br /><br />Yours,<br /><br />Baby Cromwell, Nottingham, England.
B000YEUUCK|4.0|Played the disc in my Panny DMP-BD-30K, the 2.0 PCM Stereo track worked fine, but the DolbyTruHD 5.1 track did not work.  I am wondering if anyone else had experienced the same issue.  Nevertheless, if you are a Dion fan, this is a must own.

B0007IN318|3.0|This is a good read, a well written historical novel of one of histories monumental events. I can say that I highly enjoyed it but cant say I think it was fabulous. The slow build up of events that eventually lead up to the big bang, were paced nicely and I felt the length of the novel perfect. Not too short, not too long. I learned a lot about Pompeii and the explosion of Vesuvius, things I had not known, but even so learned quite a lot about the construction of the aquaducts. On that note, I have to say I learned more than I care to have learned. The story is told through the eyes of the Aquarius, an engineer in charge of the maintaining of the aquaducts. It was an interesting way to tell the story through his eyes and I myself enjoyed the creativeness of that aspect but I cant see where many common readers would care to get that much information about these aquaducts and their functions and constructions. I felt there was way too much focus on this and not enough character development to keep the story full of suspense or compassion within the characters we meet. The author attempted to bring the protagonist a love interest and we have an inkling of a budding romance but not enough again, happens with that for a reader to get enthused about it, or to want to cheer him on in this love endeavor. I also felt that there was so much of this aquaduct story that when the actual volcanic eruption does happen at the end, not enough story goes into how the many people in different areas are affected, or what they are going through as it happens, no compassionate, heart wrenching drama to be had even though thousands of people and homes were killed and demolished. I felt the book needed a more blend of human compassion story to accompany the aquaduct aspect and the volcanic scientific input. I wont say the story was too dry, but I think it needed a little something else for it to be more enjoyable to more readers.  There simply wasnt enough character development for me to like or dislike the characters involved.ike or dislike the characters involved.
B000Q66Q06|5.0|I first saw this concert when it was broadcast on New Years Eve 1992 (back with PBS used to carry the Berlin show) and was completely blown away. I was looking for this DVD for years and recently acquired it.  My impression  hasn't changed in the intervening years. The Berlin Philharmonic and Abbado are in great form throughout.  Argerich in the Strauss Burleske is her usual amazing self, and the final scene from Rosenkavalier is lovely, with Battle  in good form not too long before her MET firing, Von Stade in great form, and Renee Fleming before she became a huge star.  Spectacular.

0517548232|5.0|This book has a nice way of explaining some basic economic facts in a way that any reasonably intelligent person can understand even if they haven't had a course in economics.  This is critical if these people are going to have input into the political process that ultimately determines economic outcomes.  Too often otherwise intelligent people are making choices that defy basic economic truths.  This book clarifies these issues and does so in an entertaining way.  It's also short-and-sweet and easy-to-read!
B000PFU7OO|5.0|I genuinely LOVE this soundtrack. Glen Hansard is incredibly talented. His style seems influenced by: (insert any great acoustic artist before him here). The song arrangement is also amazing. And Marketa Irglova's hauntingly soft voice is sweet and pure.

006135323X|1.0|I purchased the book to learn something about the human nature.  I found author's examples of irrationality interesting but quite obvious to anyone who is even marginally observant.  Since the human behavior interests me, I read the book.      Then the author came to a surprising conclusion - the free market price mechanism is not working because the people make decisions irrationally. It is some time since I read the Wealth of Nations, but I do not recollect rationality as the condition for free movement of price.      Not content with that strange reasoning, the author capps it with a whopper:  The government policies are needed for markets to work \\"for the best\\".  Now that is REALLY irrational!    I finally lost it when the author advises return to the \\"social norms\\" to replace \\"market norms\\".  Anyone with cursory knowledge of 20th century history will recognize this as socialism - you work for your Socialist state, your Fuehrer, your \\"society\\", not for money.  There is name for complete replacement of \\"market norms\\" with \\"social norms\\" - it is called SLAVERY.    I bought the book to learn about irrational human behavior.  The book is irrational, but in an unpredictable way.

B00005K3OT|5.0|One of my favorite movies has now been added to my collection of films in which Johnny Depp has performed! This film seems to transport the viewer back in time to the quaintness of a small French village and the efforts of an (at first) unappreciated chocolatier as she attempts to introduce the pleasurable sins of decadent taste to a populace hindered by over enthusiastic practices of fundamentalist religion ... time to loosen up a little and embrace the fact that we are Human, with all the faults and frailties that come with the species ~  Item arrived quickly, in excellent condition, and at a very reasonable purchase price!

0552998087|5.0|It's an account of a car journey from Des Moines, Iowa, where Bryson was born (in 1951) and raised, around small town (and some big town) America during 1987-88 written from several perspectives that give it a special interest.  Bryson looks at things in the United States from the point of view of a long-time British resident. He compares what he sees and likes or (more frequently) dislikes in 1987 with what he saw making similar car trips as a child.  He looks at the Deep South, the Wild West, the Rockies, New York City and New England through the eyes of a Midwesterner.  An added dimension reading it now is to compare what he saw then with things twenty years later (I was reminded of reading Least Heat Moon's \\"Blue Highways.\\").    He sometimes seems to be addressing a British reader as he makes his comparisons.  In many ways the differences between Britain and America have narrowed, both for better and for worse. London is now a more dangerous city than New York and the English are almost as rich and as fat as the Americans.    He's often misanthropic and grumpy but that adds to the entertainment value. If you want a nice guy saying nice things you buy a guidebook.  It's full of great one-liners, even though sometimes he tries too hard to be funny and the jokes get repeated.
B000YENUI6|3.0|Good but serious movie.  I am a Viggo Mortensen fan, and he didn't not disappoint me in this movie.  He played an unusual part and proved his flexibility in acting.
B00005JPUN|3.0|This is the latest remake of the 1956 original \\"Invasion of the Body Snatchers.\\"  Clearly, it isn't as well written as that movie, or the 1978 remake starring Donald Sutherland.  The beginning of the movie features the space shuttle crashing and spreading alien spores from space across a large part of the southern U.S.  It shows clips of CNN footage, which may in fact be actual footage from the Columbia disaster(?).  Either way, I thought this foundation of the movie was hastily and sloppily done.  But after that the movie becomes rather interesting...and fast paced.  In some respects, I thought it was scarier and creepier than the original.  Nicole Kidman does a fine job in the leading role. However, there is no escaping the fact that this is just another remake.  If you have seen the 1956 and 1978 versions, you will no doubt be a little disappointed.  But I still found it worth watching.

B000001DTM|5.0|U2's Achtung Baby (1991) is an album that I really like. Now, I like War and The Joshua Tree, too, and consider those two to be the band's finest work. I also consider Achtung Baby to be on the same level as both of those albums. The best songs on War and some on The Joshua Tree are political in nature, but there are no overt politics on Achtung Baby. If there is a theme here at all, it's the fascinating nature of women and a cynical view of relationships with them.<br /><br />I like the modern sound of Achtung Baby. It's full of sound effects, feedback and recording studio pyrotechnics. There's still plenty of emotional substance and melodic structure, it's just that the sound is more daring and stylish.<br /><br />Zoo Station and Even Better Than The Real Thing both feature the new sound along with the classic U2 melodic rock formula. The Edge's guitar work here is some of his very best. It's bold and dramatic, and it's experimental sound gives the album it's character. One is a great song, one of the band's best. The purity of love gets lost in the haze sometimes.<br /><br />Have you come here for forgiveness?<br />Have you come to raise the dead?<br />Have you come here to play Jesus<br />To the lepers in your head?<br /><br />Ultraviolet (Light My Way) and Mysterious Ways are highlights, too, and both are great songs. I also like The Fly and Love is Blindness.<br /><br />Achtung Baby is rocking, interesting and inventive, and it's one of U2's best albums. This is one that you don't want to miss.

B000CCBCAS|5.0|\\"Four Weddings and a Funeral,\\" (1994) a British romantic comedy/drama, caused something of a sensation upon its release.  It broke all records for worldwide box-office take by a British picture: and not very many British pictures since have done as well.  It was received rapturously by many important critics, and was nominated for a \\"Best Picture\\" Academy Award.  It boosted the careers of its director, Mike Newell, and most of its talented cast members.  It also made its star, Hugh Grant, flavor of the decade - and counting -- as leading man of any English-speaking romantic comedy.  It put its author, Richard Curtis, at the head of what has since become an English cottage industry, the creation of romantic Brit-coms (see \\"Notting Hill,\\"\\"Love Actually,\\"etc.)  Yet, when it was made, the budget was so tight that those glorious Scottish wedding scenes were all filmed in Hampshire, a Home County near London.  And the numerous wedding scene extras were required to wear their own evening dress.<br /><br />Most everyone knows the plot, but here goes. Charles (Grant) is one of a group of young friends looking unsuccessfully, it seems, for love.  Charles is commitment-phobic; yet he, his roommate, Scarlett (Charlotte Coleman), and the crowd seem to spend every Saturday going, late, to weddings, where they are frequently members of the wedding parties.  Disastrous best man speeches are made, rings are forgotten.  Then Charles spots the beautiful American Carrie (Andie MacDowell) at a wedding, and much yearning ensues.  Carrie announces her engagement to, and marries, a rich, older Scot, Hamish (Corin Redgrave).  But, of course, true love triumphs and triumphs and triumphs.  There are viewers that consider MacDowell's performance too passive, but everyone agrees Grant created the perfect romantic English lead, shy, stuttering, hair in his eyes.  Coleman, who unfortunately died much too young, in an asthma attack, made Scarlett touching and real.  Redgrave, well, of course.<br /><br />The supporting cast was also uniformly excellent, and funny.  Rowan Atkinson is hilarious in a small part as Father Gerald, priest in training.  James Fleet does good work as Tom, the crowd's millionaire.  Kristin Scott Thomas is beautiful, beautifully-dressed, witty, touching and intelligent as Tom's sister Fiona, who's unfortunate enough to love Charles.  Theater stalwart Simon Callow shines as the gay Gareth; and, as for John Hannah, playing his lover Matthew; well, it's all been said, hasn't it.  Though I'd add that I never yet have re watched this movie -- did so again last night--without being reduced to tears by his reading of WH Auden's \\"Funeral Blues\\" poem at Gareth's untimely funeral.<br /><br />If you love the movie, the Deluxe Edition is useful.  Its extras are very helpful: Audio Commentary with filmmakers, \\"Wedding Planners\\" Documentary, \\"Two Actors and a Director\\" featurette, and the featurette on the making of the film.  The deleted scenes are uniformly funny, too, and give us a bit more back-story of the characters, which the movie doesn't give us a lot of.rting cast was also uniformly excellent, and funny.

B000PFUA9G|5.0|Just when you think he can't get better, Paisley surpasses your expectations.  There is no song on this album which would not be a hit single.

It is impossible not to salute the relentless pursuit of perfection, especially when it is combined with humor and humility.
B000VNMMQG|5.0|I enjoyed the movie. The title for this movie is silly. The main Character of the Movie is William Wiberforce.  William Wilberforce knew the author of the song Amazing Grace, but so what. The movie is not about Mr. Newton, the Song, or Grace. Twice in the movie is song in a relative contrived way. The song does not fit the movie or the situation in the movie. William Wilberforce's faith pays a major part of the movie. To say God's Grace is a theme of the movie would be a stretch.  It is clear the title was chosen to sell the movie.<br /><br />This is an excellent depiction of a man who worked with single mindedness to change the law about the slave trade. It depicts a man struggling with his conscience, cultural forces, his faith, and political reality. The man pursues what he believes to be true, correct, and God's Will.  He tries to bring social change through argument and protest. He works with great energy to change the minds of those in power, but over the years of slow progress he becomes weary of his consuming passion to meet his goal.  His passion has progress in society, but the minds in parliament change slower.  How to frame the argument? How to gather allies who have deviating agendas, but agree in the end of the slave trade? The movie does an excellent job telling the horror of the shipment of human cargo. The movie tells how the French revolution detracts from the political process to end the trade. Less is told of the common poverty of the time. This movie depicts a Christian man, but I consider it less then accurate its depiction how church and Faith effected society as a whole in that the time period of the events shown.  The one book I read written William Wilberforce tells of a Christendom society that one's declared Faith does not reflect Godly nature in one's daily life. I believe a good portion of both his allies and his opposition positioned themselves as Christians, at least in the manner of regular church attendance and shape of argument. This is totally lacking in the movie. I know Locke by his time had great effect on public argument, but I doubt this much.  Anyway my side thoughts besides, it still is a good movie. The times are not portrayed as what was.tally lacking in the movie. I know Locke by his time had great effect on public argument, but I doubt this much.

6302470021|2.0|After a mercifully unviewed version appeared on CBS in the early 1950's, Ian Fleming sold the film rights to actor/director/producer Gregory Ratoff.  Nothing ever came of it and Ratoff died owning the rights. It later passed to former agent Charlie Feldman.  When Feldman could not obtain the services of Sean Connery (still under contract to Cubby Broccoli & Harry Saltzman), he decided to make a spoof instead.  His instructions to Terry Southern and the other writers was to \\"throw out the plot\\" -- inwhich they thoroughly succeeded.  Large cast of well known actors, several different directors and an imprehensible waste of time -- even with Woody Allen, Peter Sellers and Orson Welles.  For a completist only.  If you want a spoof watch Derek Flint, Matt Helm or Austin Powers.
B000NVIGC0|5.0|Wilco, probably deserve to be the most talked about band of all contemporary bands. Derived from a Genre creating band in Uncle Tupelo (How do the Jayhawks feel about that?)the leader, Jeff Tweedy, being the other guy in the band who, when left, alone, lost and disillusioned, outgrew his former bandmate and didn't stop until he'd nearly explored everything in terms of avant garde music, illness, breakups, narcotics and especially greatness.    Wilco's first two albums were Alt Country masterpieces, then came Summerteeth, less alt country , more Avant Garde Pop brilliance until they/Tweedy, went the full whole hog with Yankee Hotel and a Ghost is Born in terms of exploration, utilisation of the best free style instrumentatlists, Nils Cline and Glen Kotche and just plain out there stuff.  I love Spiders (Kidsmoke) its an all time classic but ain't Alt Country in any shape or form.    So here comes Sky Blue Sky and its like Jeff said no!, we'll do an album that is lovely, accessible and beautiful.  Its almost like Jeff suddenly reached maturity and came up with the goods.  The opening track is lovely Jayhawks/Byrds like jingle jangle with expressive Tweedy lyrics and on, it goes, no ego's just band created mellow crafted tunes.    Track 3 \\" Impossible Germany\\" grabs you with its tunefulness and melodics not to mention the absolutely amazing guitar by Nels Cline. The elongated guitars augmented by astonishing percussion and the support guitars of Pat Sansone are brilliant.  I have no idea what the lyrics mean, i'm guessing its something to do with the 2nd World War, or aftermatch of, but its the music that kills ya on this track. Followed up  with \\"Sky Blue Sky\\" & \\"Side with the Seeds\\" absolute gems. Further on the Beatles, Dylan and all other influences are trialled, and on at least three tracks towards the end (On & On & On)it could be JL singing.    My gut feel is that if this had followed Being There and the band had expanded into Ghosts and Yankee from there, everyone would have been happy, but for me this is their best album, gutsy, relevant and brilliant.    This is the first of a triumvirate of Alt Country Artist's, who have delivered masterpieces in 07/08, (Wilco, Ryan Adams, Gary Louris)hopefully bringing them all, the attention they deserve.

B000I5XOVY|5.0|I saw this movie in dvd but i got the bluray because i really like it.
B00004RF8J|5.0|This movie is strange. It reminds me of another strange one called &#34;Rocky Horror Show&#34;. Both of them are cult classics. &#34;Little Shop&#34; is deliciously funny and entertaining. One of those movies that I enjoy seeing again and again. It is old that even if they do not have the modern special effects for a monster film, still it can stand on its own. Yes, it is a musical. Although nothing is exceptionally catchy, Steve Martin's song is unforgettable. Steve Martin makes root canal sounds fun.<br /><br />The plot? It is about this strange plant who eats human. It gets bigger and hungrier every meal. A love triangle between Seymour (Rick Moranis), Audrey (Ellen Greene) and Orin (Steve Martin). Seymour is desperately in love with Audrey, but she's taken. Orin in turn is the sadistic dentist and leather-clad biker type boyfriend of Seymour. In the end, somebody dies. ...Well, forget about the plot. Just watch it - Because it's FUN! Definitely a must-have for my movie collection.
B00005JPUN|4.0|Each incarnation of the Jack Finney story has been a product of the time inwhich the film was made.  The original during the Cold War, the Phil Kaufmann remake during a time of Jonestown and other cults.  Now this version in the era of the pandemic.  This isn't a bad picture.  It just isn't remarkably new. Daniel Craig, while working on this picture, got the word he had been tapped to follow Pierce Brosnan as 007.
B000TGQDZQ|5.0|To be perfectly honest, I only really started listening to Epica after Tarja Turunen's dismissal from Nightwish. To me, Dark Passion Play wasn't as great as it should have been. So I turned to Epica's newest release. And now I'm almost glad Tarja was kicked off of Nightwish, I probably wouldn't have heard this album if she wasn't.    This is one of the best CDs I've heard in a long time. Epica really seem to master the aspects of Symphonic Metal that I like so much. Simone's vocals are amazing and operatic, the guitar and bass play perfectly to compliment the orchestral parts (and vice-versa), and the drummer is amazing.    As someone else said in another review, I really love that the songs almost all exceed 6 minutes in length. I feel that they wouldn't be nearly as great if they were only three or four minutes long, and the fourteen minute title track is now one of my all time favourite songs.    There are a couple problems I have with this album though. My biggest problem is probably the growling. Don't get me wrong, they're great when placed in the right spot. The problem is that sometimes it seems Mark was growling just to fill the song, without regard to how it fit. There were times, like on \\"The Obsessive Devotion\\" and \\"Never Enough\\", where they worked perfectly. But on some songs, like \\"Beyond Belief\\", I think the song would have sounded better if he didn't growl and just let the instruments do their job.    Another problem is that at times it seemed that, while the guitars and bass complimented the orchestral parts, there were times when it seemed the orchestra completely overshadowed them. But again, at times it worked out better because of it.    So all in all, this is easily the best Symphonic Metal album to be released since Nightwish's \\"Once.\\" And in some aspects, it's even better. If you like Symphonic Metal, get this album.
B000ZN802W|3.0|Obviously spoilers below ...<br /><br />I have a difficult time writing this review because of concern with the star rating that I've chosen for it. I've broken this review down into seven different sections for obvious reasons, as each section is something that should be addressed when talking about either this film, this book, the people involved from the actors to the McCandless's to Sean Penn himself.<br /><br />The Book -<br /><br />There are probably more people that will initially come to this film because of the book than the other way around; but over time this film will be seen by more people that haven't read the book or possibly even be aware of a book. That's not a critique of the material, just a plain fact. More people watch films than read books these days.<br /><br />The story of Chris McCandless though, should start with the book and how Krakauer started a snowball with a simple article in `Outdoor' Magazine which A LOT of people who had met Chris (as Alex) had responded to with comments like: \\"Hey, I met him trying to hitch a ride ...\\" Jon Krakauer spent a lot of time putting the book together through accounts, phone calls, letters and meetings to find out how the information of Chris all come together; and more importantly how Chris had touched the lives and made such a stand-out impression on each of these very random people that he came across. In fact, Chris made such an impression on these people that some people read the article and wrote Krakauer stating: \\"This guy sounds like a guy I met near the Salton Sea, etc.\\"  This is the real essence of how this story really came together and people should be aware of it. All of this transpired BEFORE the book. Someone had even heard the story of a dead hiker found in Alaska on Paul Harvey and Westerberg thought it might be him so he called the Alaskan authorities. Strangely, the Paul Harvey piece was how I had first heard of McCandless as well. So, knowing what you know now, maybe having read the book and seen the film, one must give proper credence to the impact of Chris McCandless in the lives of the people he met. I'll come back to this point later.<br /><br />The Screenplay & Film -<br /><br />Having watched hundreds of films through the years and then going back and listening to the Director's Commentary whenever possible, I've learned a great many things. Foremost, which is relevant to this story, is how Robert Zemeckis worked with several writer's over the course of a handful of years sharpening the [[ASIN:B00003CXA2 Forrest Gump]] adapted script. Anyone who had seen the film and read the book, knows the point that's coming. Sometimes the spirit of the material is more important than the bulk of the material. In the case of Forrest Gump, I believe Zemeckis stated that the screenplay went through three different writers and multiple revisions until the last person, Eric Roth had figured out what Forrest Gump was really about. Christopher McCandless's story was surely about the spirit of the material; and definitely not about the bulk, which is how it comes across on the screen as delivered -- and very choppy at that.<br /><br />Sean Penn adapted this directly from the book, decided which parts to focus on and what to leave out. The real problem seems to stem from Penn not wanting to get into the middle of the McCandless / Supertramp dynamic which was painfully obvious in the book, but Penn tries to maintain the high ground of being impartial which doesn't really serve the story. Sean Penn probably would've been better served leaning one way or the other regarding McCandless and showing us \\"why\\" through the film, rather than leaving it ambiguous. The whole point of being there, was to be transported to a point of view.<br /><br />Christopher McCandless was not a middle-of-the-road / dry-journalism kind of guy. I will say that this long drawn out, meandering approach worked well for Penn with [[ASIN:B00005PJ6Q The Indian Runner]], an older film of his which is one of my top ten films of all time. In Indian Runner, Penn let the viewer decide and observe the true nature of Frank Roberts, wickedly played by Viggo Mortenson. Viggo emoted so thickly, so heavily and breathed such life into the character that you couldn't help but be compelled - no matter how long the movie was. When it ended you were looking everywhere for more footage, maybe a book, a Bruce Springsteen album, footnotes, anything that would give you more about what you had just seen. But with Chris, Penn should've made a decision about which was a greater loss - Supertramp or McCandless, simply because Frank was a fictional character, while Chris was not.<br /><br />Ignoring the psychological breakdown and split of the character should've been the touchstone of this movie, but it wasn't. The split, Alexander Supertramp, was treated as just a shallow creation or a childish whim by a foolish youth - instead of the self-absorbed superman from Nietzsche's `[[ASIN:1845882423 \\"Thus Spake Zarathustra\\"]]' that Chris had imagined himself to be which seemed to take root while he was at Emory. Most of the readers of the Krakauer book seemed to have bonded with the idealistic Supertramp, rather than the foolish McCandles that the readers of Outdoor Magazine unanimously gave a thumbs down to for the fear of being a reckless role-model to other readers and enthusiasts.<br /><br />This film does not tell the story from the perspective of Alex Supertramp, although it tries to shed light to it. It also does not tell the story of Chris McCandless, although it tries to convince us of this, by wrapping itself in the facts that were collected by Jon Krakauer and passing itself as a film version with the same title.<br /><br />However, some of the book's complicated undertone of sadness, confusion, and idealism are lightly palpable in the film. Chris McCandless was a romantic; Krakauer's book appreciates that, as well as Chris's youthful idealism and smugness. But unfortunately, the film seems to miss most of this.<br /><br />A real, and massive breakdown in this film was the use of narration. While I am a huge advocate of V.O. Narration, a case exists here for the absence of one. Having Jena Malone, of Donnie Darko fame, and a mediocre talent, speaking her inner thoughts over scenic footage does this film a serious disservice, comes across as inconsistent and tacked on for effect. There were many other ways to tell this story better, but sometimes good books do not always translate into good movies.<br /><br />The Music -<br /><br />Eddie Vedder, like Sean Penn, is difficult as a personality to separate from his art due to certain  things that have transpired in the last decade. Anytime I hear Pearl Jam these days, all I can hear is a talented musician who wasted himself indulging in his own flaws - strangely much like McCandless, except Vedder did this with his career and not his life. Vedder thought that it was appropriate to repeat and stick with the now-dead North-West sound which is the last bastion of Seattle Grunge. Granted, this soundtrack is probably the biggest departure for him in a long time, but looking at the contribution of his work for this film, one is left wondering - why Vedder? The music sounds uninspired and dull, where nothing really stands out thematically and there actually seems to be a void where a musical theme should be. Penn should've befriended Gabriel Yared as the first choice to do the score. But I find this just one more bad choice in a long line of bad choices made by Penn for the production of this movie. Going back to Indian Runner, which has a great score and a well-placed soundtrack, it seems as if the magic just couldn't be duplicated for what would've been a great film and probably an equally great soundtrack and score.<br /><br />I do want to state that I don't agree with the Awards Academy that the music comes off as \\"too song based\\", whatever that means. I think that's one of the most ridiculousstatements ever to come out of whatever administration Hollywood has. I also believe that, even though I didn't like it, Vedder should at least been nominated for his efforts for an Oscar.<br /><br />The Actors -<br /><br />I'm holding the minority report on this one, but I really don't believe that Emile Hirsch was all that good in this film. Yes, he has a basic resemblance to McCandless as any young, mousy haired twenty-something actor would. McCandless was a magnetic personality that people were struck into awe by when they met, even once. Emile Hirsch has none of those qualities, if he does, they certainly weren't evinced in this movie. I feel he came off bland and gave a very weak performance of McCandless, which actually bordered on shameful and pedestrian. It was if someone had asked him to play Jesus Christ and he decided that maybe a hollow representation of Truman Capote was more appropriate. Emile Hirsch's acting in this is the real Achilles heal here and couldn't have been further off the mark. There could've been so many other actors who would've handled this role with more realism, energy and vivaciousness. Emile Hirsch's rendition of McCandless is pretty sad to say the least, he was filler for those just wanting to navel-gaze.<br /><br />The casting director and Penn set up a would-be Oscar dream-tream with the supporting cast. Hal Holbrook gives his \\"John Wayne\\" performance here and does so magnificently and very memorably. Catherine Keener is dynamic, William Hurt (my favorite actor in this)  is magnetic, delivering a strong and convincing portrayal of the person you encounter when you read the book and Vince Vaughn is a nice choice for Wayne Westerburg. So what could go so insidiously wrong here?<br /><br />The Critics -<br /><br />A lot has been said regarding what was left in and what was left out, differing between the book and the movie. It should be stated that McCandless had a basic road map of the area, some money, his identification cards and some have speculated -- a broken or injured arm. Some cite the picture of Chris in front of the bus  as evidence-light. Looking closely at his right arm, it appears not to in the sleeve but under his shirt wrapped in a sling. In a later photograph though, he's seen with both arms visible and free from sling or obvious injury.<br /><br />I have posted both photos above for those interested to see.<br /><br />Chris M. / Alex S. -<br /><br />What would Christopher J. McCandless say about all this? How would he have felt about a feature film immortalizing and lionizing his deeds for better or worse?<br /><br />McCandless did want to become a writer, this much is known from the friends he met and made. Had he lived, he would've wanted to chronicle his adventures, and maybe becoming famous for it. If he did, it would've been an after effect and if a film was made of his works -- spoils of war, so to speak. But this is all hyperbole and supposition now. The truth is no one would want the worst decisions of their early twenties to be the defining moments of their lives and then be broadcast across the globe for all to see without any say.<br /><br />Alex Supertramp would've loathed the telling, the filming and the mass marketing of this effort. Alex would've wondered where the spirit and the fire and the message was had he sat in a theatre and watched this play out. Perhaps this was the problem McCandless's parents had when they saw this during the screening, maybe they \\"felt the lack of it\\", to quote Penn from [[ASIN:B00005PJ8T another movie]]. Having been author to anti-establishment writing, I may be a little biased in my viewpoint. I only state this as some readers of this review might click on my other reviews or see my writings and then feel that I was being inconsistent. While I can understand McCandless and see the world of which he spoke of, as an ex-Marine and a long-distance hiker of the Appalachian trail, of his methods and planning - I cannot abide. So, like many other readers and viewers, I too have a split opinion of McCandless.<br /><br />Sean Penn -<br /><br />Like I stated about Vedder, it's hard sometimes for consumers of art to sometimes remove their view of the artist from the art and therefore see it unobstructed. Sean Penn has done and said many things in the last numerous years to anger enough people, and isolate himself with his point of view. Maybe making a film about a man who railed inwardly in anger over consumerism, urban blight and gross waste and personal attachment was more powerful and greater than anything he could've said or done by himself. So, at least in the spirit of the thing, he does deserve that much credit - if that was the case. Otherwise, many viewers might see this movie and only witness the smugness of Chris McCandless and the smugness of Sean Penn, and thus walk away disappointed and regretful of the time spent. That, at least, does sum up much of the bad reviews so far about this film.<br /><br />Living on the West Coast, in Los Angeles, I've actually crossed paths with Penn a few times so far in life. The last time was in San Francisco, when I was spending a long day at the bar drinking at Tosca's in North beach. It's the kind of place that most people, tourists included don't go, because they just don't understand the allure; which is absolutely fine by me. My exchange with him was brief and cordial. If I would've seen this movie first, I would've probably had a lot more to say to him.<br /><br />I wanted to give this more stars because I do appreciate Sean Penn's contribution to film, his acting and his temperament. I also wanted to give it more stars for Chris McCandless, but ... it's more a review of the film than it is of any one person.statements ever to come out of whatever administration Hollywood has.

B00003CWPL|3.0|This review is from: [[ASIN:B00003CWPL Eraserhead]]<br /><br />I think \\"Eraserhead\\" is surely the type of movie most people will either hate (casual, mainstream viewers) or like (an open-minded viewer for film appreciation). I found myself unusually drawn to it (and mesmerized) because quite frankly the more weirder it got, the more interesting it became.<br /><br />In a nut shell, this film is about the solitary life of a man (who is on vacation from his job as he constantly reminds people) that lives in a run-down almost abandoned building in what appears to be an industrialized, urban city. Throughout the film we learn the man eventually gets a baby that is abnormal (at least appears abnormal to us) with mutant-like features from a woman that appears disturbed (from a family with a disturbed behavior but appears normal looking). The film constantly shows images from what appears (to me) from the man's dreams because he struggles to sleep in the presence of his disturbed wife, screaming mutant baby and the inquisitive, but seductive lady neighbor next door. A lady with a slight, mutant appearance sings about \\"dancing in heaven\\" every time the man is near his room's heater radiator.<br /><br />CONS FOR THE MAINSTREAM VIEWER;<br />It's in black & white. The characters are dull. I don't understand it.<br /><br />PROS FOR THE INQUISITIVE VIEWER;<br />The black & white and the dull appearances of the background sets the tone for the film which is dark & depressive. While the images and scenes are disturbing and unusual (such as the menstrutating chicken, the tapeworms & the destruction of the baby), they are memorable because chances are you have never seen a film quite like this. After all, I think one of the unique purposes of film is to create long, lasting impressions. There really isn't much of a plot to this film. It's just open for your own interpretation.<br /><br />If you can casually watch \\"Eraserhead\\" and appreciate for what it is and what it attempts to present then you can enjoy it. If you hate it, then you better stick to the mainstream movies with overpaid actors/actresses, multi-billion dollar special effects and the always happy, Hollywood, endings.en you better stick to the mainstream movies with overpaid actors/actresses, multi-billion dollar special effects and the always happy, Hollywood, endings.
B000XUOIQ4|4.0|I have always enjoyed this film.  Being a Disney fan it is hard not to.  But, it is NOT among  their best in my opinion.  Remember, the 1st complete animated release after Walt's passing in December 1966.  He had worked on the MUCH better The Jungle Book.    When I saw there was going to be this special edition I normally really love Disney's special edition or Platinum DVD releases.    Man, what a disappointment.  For the price.    Only a 1 disc package.  WHERE IS THE 2CD DISC WITH SOME GOOD EXTRAS?    There is no 'Making of\\" or \\"Behind the Scenes\\" on  the film.  I normally really enjoy watching these.    Good to have the film in wide screen.    About ½ of the \\"extras\\" on this 1 DISC DVD PACKAGE, AGAIN SAYING SPECIAL EDITION, were just fun activities for kids.  How about the adults?  ONLY kids want Disney films on DVD?    Let's hope Disney does a better job the next time they release this film on DVD.

B0013F2M52|5.0|Elbow, in my honest opinion, are one of the world's most highly underrated bands.  This album deserves listen after listen after listen.  Each time I keep finding more and more reasons to think if this album as one of the best albums for years, and a sure contender for an album of the year.  Stand out tracks.   Bones of You. Storming track with an amazingly clever mix of hard bass line and single note acoustic strumming. Simply amazing.  Mirrorball. Simply put, this has to be one of the best tracks on an album ever.  The kick drum beat and piano in this track send shivers down my spine. EVERY. TIME. I. HEAR. IT.  Weather to Fly. Gorgeous. Pure class.   Elbow have just pulled out all the stops on this album. It is climbing very quickly to one of my all time classics.  And above all, I just cannot write a review without mentioning Guy Garvey's lyrical genius.   If I gush on about his way with words, I'll embarass myself. He has a gift. He is one of modern rock's geniuses.  I'll leave it at that.

B0009VRHLK|4.0|It's hard to describe Vincent Gallo's \\"The Brown Bunny\\" in words because it does not operate on a narrative level.  Most movies tell a story, The Brown Bunny tells an emotion.  Were it that easy to describe that emotion, I would, but like the emotions that come with love and the loss of it, it's not simple to explain.t    This movie is best left to each viewer to decide his or her own opinion.   Most people will either love it or hate it.  I'll admit that it is, for the most part, boring.  18 second long shots are common (the average in Hollywood is 2-5 seconds), there is very sparse dialog, and there is not much plot involved.  Simply put, Gallo plays Bud Clay (who is a polar opposite of his character in Buffalo '66).  Clay is softspoken, seemingly sensitive, and holds secrets from the viewer.  He departs on a journey looking for a lost love, all the while not much is known about his motives or what transpired between them to lead to his current, lonesome state.  Without saying too much, most of the importance of the film is in the end, which definitely drives Gallo's vision home.  The rest of the movie is not to be ignored, however, as it sets the viewer into an odd, emotional state on par with no other movie I've seen.    From a technical sense, the shots are simple, but beautiful.  Constant long shots of lonely driving transports the viewer to a similar frame of isolation.  Unknowingly, and effected viewer feels something for Bud Clay, even if he or she is unaware of what the feeling is.  These scenes, coupled with an incredible soundtrack, present an experience unlike others offered on film.    Yes, the movie is flawed in that it is inherently boring, but driving long trips in one shot (on one's own) often is.  Unfortunately, it is a necessity to allow the viewer some empathy in viewing this film.  Just be  glad that about 30 minutes was edited out of the film.
B000026FOA|2.0|This guy got passed me back in the day, even though I basically bought every album that came out back in the 60s and 70s. I was listening to sattelite radio and heard a cut from this one and I liked the moodish thing going on and the hint of drug influence in there somewhere, so I checked out a few websites on Nick Drake. His tragic story kind of hooked me so I bought this CD. Quite frankly I find this to be interesting, but not something I would recomend to everybody. The mood of depression stays so heavy that every song sounds the same and makes me feel like I am watching one of those pulse readouts in a hospital room, and it is a flatliner. I suppose that some people dig this mellowed out sort of \\"I wanna leave this world stuff\\" but I get enough of it quick. Drake's guitar work was a bit unique in it's time, but as many times as I try, I just can't quite get with this program. It is good to listen to and then take a nap.
B0002EXH5O|5.0|RIP is an absolute, all out guitar factory!!!  There are so many precise riffs on this album that I am still amazed when I hear it after all these years.  Nick's drums are forboding sonic asault!  He is one of the most entertaining drummers to watch live.  It's almost like he hates the drums and wants to destroy them.  Even the base lines are incredible as are the several base leads and intros.  This is by far the best effort from Megadeth and certainly one of the best metal albums of all time. If all albums were created like this one, I'd have been deaf a long time ago. Buy it!!! Do it! Do it now!!!! Stop reading and buy the @%^& album!!!
B000002KCV|5.0|I can't say anything bad about a Neil Young Album, so this is no different. However, this one is a personal favorite of mine. In these songs Neil shows a more mellow easy-going contented side. This music just makes you feel good. It has an \\"americana\\" feel to it that takes you back to better and less confusing times. The title song \\"Comes a Time\\" conveys the message of how Neil was feeling at the time of this album. If when the world all around you is crazy, you have to think about the basics like the love of a woman and children, and a realization that there is a time for doing what comes naturally. Some people have even tagged this one as a kind of sellout or safe album for Neil, and I can understand why, but when Neil has covered so much ground in his career, it seems only fitting that he would cover the good times with good time music. This one is worth having especially for the real fans.

006135323X|5.0|Dan Ariely presents data suggesting that our capacity for decision making is based primarily on our ability to compare things and ideas.  Further experiments show that manipulation of one item dramatically changes the comparitive worth of similar items and, specifically, changes how we value those similar items.    If one buys into Ariely's arguments, and his experiments are rather convincing, it suggests most of our decision-making is based on unconscious, arbitrary comparisons formed minutes or years prior.  I find that to be a convincing but profoundly depressing view of human nature.      True, Ariely suggests we can and should find our way out of this arbitariness by living Plato's \\"examined life.\\"  Perhaps this is possible in the world of acedmia.  The reality for most makes a the examined life an impossibility.  People make to many decisions to spend time contemplating the worth of a \\"number two value meal\\" compared to the \\"number three.\\"  Our decision making process is largely automatic.  Given a list of 100 grocery items and 45 minutes to shop, who could ever have the time to contemplate the value of Prego over Ragu over Newman's own... and still have time to manage the cereal aisle.    In sum, Ariely leads me to view my life as an arbitrary conglomeration of initial anchors.  A few times a day I can make an examined decision... the rest of the time I live based upon the fog of the past.
B000002J03|5.0|I really don't know how you could critize this album/CD. Possibly you could find some fault with it if you were coming from the perspective of comparing it to the first two Hendrix outings or early Doors but looking at this on a comparative basis to 95 per cent of everything else before or after then you realize just how massive the effect of this work has been. Intense, non-stop over the top talent setting an early bar for this type of music that really has never been eclipsed. Regardless of critisism of where Page got his licks and compositions, he sat in the driver's seat and pushed the pedal to the metal on every track on this one. The overall effect is a major mind attack by one of the top 3 heavy rock bands of all time. If you are young and have never experienced Zeppelin, then you need this one or if you have forgotten what the real deal is, you need this refresher course.
B000YEUUCK|2.0|I was very excited to know that the Celine Dion Las Vagas act was coming out on the Blu-Ray DVD that I pre-ordered in advanced through Amazon.  Having not being able to attend the concert this would be the next best thing.  However when I received the DVD it was defective with static sound three quarters into the DVD.  I expressed my concerns to Amazon and was amazed with the customer service by agreeing to replace the DVD.  I have since than received the replacement, but was disappointed that the static problem is the on replacement as well.  I am not sure if this is an manufracture error.  I am curious to know if other customers who ordered this DVD expressed this same problem.  Any regards I am at a lost as what to do next.  I am considering whether to purchase another copy at my local mall (forefeit my cost) and keep my finger crossed.    Shirley
B0013D8LOU|5.0|Sweeney Todd is the story of a barber named Benjamin Barker who comes back to London for revenge after being taken away from his family. Todd was sent away to be jailed for a crime he didn't commit by the town judge, who was in love with his wife. Within the first ten minutes of you meeting Sweeney Todd we are introduced to the song \\"No Place like London\\". The song tells us about the anger and hate Sweeney has towards London, and it also tells us a about Sweeney's past using flashbacks, \\"There was a barber and his wife, and she was beautiful. A foolish barber and his wife, she was his reason and his life and she was beautiful, and she was virtuous and he was naïve. There was another man who saw that she was beautiful, a biased vulture of the law who, with a gesture of his claw removed the barber from his plate, and there was nothing but to wait.\\"    Barker changes his name to Sweeney Todd, so that he could not be recognized. Before he was sent away, Todd and his family were old tenants of Mrs. Lovett, the owner of a local meat pie shop. Mrs. Lovett allows Sweeney to open up a barber shop up stairs from her pie shop because she has been in love with him for years. Together they make the perfect team of murderers. Sweeney kills his customers, and Mrs. Lovett bakes pies out of them to hide the bodies.    Perhaps the most important scene is when Mrs. Lovett is telling Sweeney what happened to Barker's wife after he was taken away. The music starts soft and then gets faster and louder, with the camera jumping from Sweeney to Mrs. Lovett. Once Mrs. Lovett tells Sweeney that the judge took advantage of his wife, Sweeney yells and that's how Mrs. Lovett figures out that Sweeney Todd is really Benjamin Barker. During this scene you witness a side of Sweeney that you probably only see twice during the entire movie. Sweeney is destroyed because he has been told that his wife is dead and his daughter is being held by the judge. The music changes from soft, to fast, to playful,and \\"the way the camera glides, the way it moves, it's a perfect fit.\\" (Sondheim)    The casting was impeccable, with Johnny Depp as Sweeney Todd, Helena Bonham Carter as Mrs. Lovett, Alan Rickman as Judge Turpin, and Edward Sanders as Toby. I honestly can't imagine a better cast. It's hard to believe that this is the first musical for both Depp and Carter. Their voices keep you focused on what is going on and they sound absolutely heavenly. Each character brings something different to the table, and together they make the film stand out from other musicals.    The movie was shot in a dark, gloomy, black and gray London. There are only two parts of the movie that are actually in color. When Mrs. Lovett, Sweeney, and Toby are in Mrs. Lovett's fantasy world, and whenever Sweeney killed someone the blood was red. I'm not a fan of black and gray films, but while watching Sweeney Todd it didn't bother me at all.   I know that Sweeney Todd is obviously a musical, but it seems to me like there's a lot more music than in other musicals. Sondheim said that there's so much music in the piece because \\"As long as you keep the music going the audience forgets the melodramatic of the story.\\" The music ranges from funny, sad, angry, scary, and playful. The music keeps you focused in what's going on. Every song was timed perfectly giving you just enough time to recover from the last song.    Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street is truly a work of art created by Stephen Sondheim, with the direction of Tim Burton and brought to life by an amazing cast. The storyline is intriguing, the music keeps you wanting more, and you feel for the characters. In an almost trivial way you realize that hiding behind all the madness, sadness, and blood there's an even bigger true meaning of why the characters made the decisions they did, it was all for love. Sweeney Todd is a classic, and everyone should have the chance to experience this masterpiece.
0743496736|2.0|This is a page-turner, but it has nothing new to offer about what makes a person do a terrible thing.  The characters are shallow: a teenage girl whose relationship with her mother is less than perfect, a jock who wants to show power over his girlfriend, a loner whose parents have no clue what he's really thinking.  It's shallow, poorly written (she's too prolific to be truly great) and a weak attempt at understanding a far-too-common event in the news.

B000TGJ8CQ|3.0|The casting in this film didn't work too well. With the exception of the National Treasure movies, I've never been overly impressed with Nicholas Cage as the leading man in a movie.  He's a strong supporting actor.  Plus Cage seems to be a little old for such an action-driven part with a young love interest. And I hate the hair style and its attempt to make him look younger.  And I just don't like Jessica Biel.  Not sure why.  And Julianne Moore tries to be the tough FBI agent and just comes off as a you know what.  And it didn't help that they left important questions unanswered (particularly the one revolving around Biel's character).  So why did I give it 3 stars?  Well, it does have some very good moments that made it worth watching.<br /><br />The story is actually quite interesting.  A man with the ability to see a few minutes into his own future?  What could a person do with that power?  The film uses it to provide a lot of humor, for one.  Chris uses it in the casino, then uses it to dodge security in said casino.  One bit that was very good was how he not only sees into the future, he can see more than one possible future depending on his own actions.  When he finally meets Jessica Biel, he changes his \\"approach\\" several times to see what will get her to like him!  Cage is charming and it comes across here.  While I think he was too old for the part, and the love-interest of Biel, he did well with it because a person would have to have years of experience to use that power as well as he does in this film.  The special effects were well done.  Nothing awesome, just suited to the movie's tone and story.  The story also had some surprises thrown in to keep the audience guessing. When was Chris using the power, and when wasn't he?  The nuclear bomb scare that has Moore hunting him was silly.  I just couldn't see how his two minutes of sight could help there (and neither could he).  The producers never managed to overcome that, though they did try.  It would have been better to just have them after him because of the power itself.  The ending.  Well, the ending will leave you thinking about the entire film.  Some will hate it, and some will love it.  And though I don't like to admit it (as I fall in the first camp) it was nearly perfect for such a movie.<br /><br />Overall, give this flick a chance and rent it.  I was entertained, and that's the most important criteria that needs to be met.better to just have them after him because of the power itself.  The ending.

B000Y7U98C|2.0|I love scifi flicks.  Especially disaster scifi flicks.  I'm already prepared to suspend my disbelief before I even start watching.  Man can tunnel to the center of the Earth to restart the core.  We can land on an asteroid and split it in two before it hits Earth.  We can travel to Mars to find out why our plants aren't growing.  We can travel to the sun and start our own mini-big bang?  Of course we can!  Unfortunately, it is going to be a boring trip there.<br /><br />The first half of this film was very slow as we learn why there is a mission, who these people are, and start guessing who will die first.  Not that it's much of a guess at first - no salvation of mankind mission can succeed without sacrifices and we all know the captain/leader has to bite it first so the rest of them can descend into chaos before finally achieving success.  I'm willing to go along with all that, no problem.  What really turned me against this movie was the abrupt shift from  theoretical scifi film into a horror movie.  I mean a \\"creeping around in the dark while a killer searches for you without turning on the lights\\" type of horror movie. A ripping apart bodies, gruesome horror movie.  What?!  Add to that a killer who sank right through my suspension of disbelief because it was so unbelievable, and completely unnecessary.<br /><br />This movie seemed like it was trying to out-spook \\"Event Horizon\\" while saving the world ala \\"Red Planet.\\"  But, Event Horizon made no bones that is would be a creepy ghost/thriller.  And Red Planet remained a mostly slow-paced scifi flick to the end.  For me, the shift in gears didn't help this film, it just made a slow movie into a boring one.  I really like Cillian Murphy and Michelle Yeoh, but their roles didn't have enough meat for them to really shine. The special effects were pretty good, but weren't enough to overcome two-dimensional characters with nothing to do but die.  I'm so glad I didn't buy the DVD.  If you like horror films, this may be different than the typical kind.  But those looking for a science fiction film may be disappointed.the typical kind.

B000Y7U98C|1.0|I actually thought this movie was mediocre for the first 45 min until randomly, a mans face flashed on the screen very quickly like a subliminal message. Then a few seconds later a womans face, then a different mans face again! I found this EXTREMELY DISTURBING. It didnt seem like it was supposed to be part of the movie although others have said it is. I dont understand why anyone would want to ruin a movie like that. Whoever thought that was a good idea is a moron. I was so  startled, confused and annoyed that I had no urge to watch the rest of the movie. After reading reviews Im glad I didnt finish it!   Awful Awful Movie.
B0012GVKVY|5.0|I own both formats and have viewed more movies on both than I probably should!!! I have to date been more impressed with my movies on hd dvd for picture and audio quality until I Robot, I enjoyed the movie when it came out and took the opportunity to rent the BD release and all I can say is WOW!!! the picture quality is on par with the top tier releases I have viewed! The audio (dts master) is possibly the best I have experienced, clear, crisp, lifelike surround which combined with the picture quality and to me an excellent story makes this overall experience an A+++++! If you are a fan of sci-fi  this is a must have for your HD collection!
B0010YSD7M|5.0|Like many, I'm a long time follower of the show. I remember after the first episode, my father said \\"With this kind of story line, they can go anywhere. There's infinite possibilities.\\" Most thankfully, 11 years later, they still prove there is!    The cinematic value is higher than the tv show. The music score is much richer and encompassing. Just hearing the theme at the beginning was worth the price of the dvd. I truly miss the show.
B0012QCZ4K|3.0|After the new \\"Star Wars\\" trilogy, Hayden Christensen and Samuel L. Jackson are again in sci-fi action, Christensen this time as `jumper' who has the power to teleport and Jackson as `paladin' who hunts the jumpers, believing that only God should have that power. The plot is thin (and there are lots of plot holes) or the back story is almost non-existent, but these things are not the only flaws in \\"Jumper\\" which could have been a more entertaining film.    For whatever happens to our hero Christensen plays, we just don't care. We simply need more interesting character that can carry the whole film to the end. Actually the film's premise is not bad. Some viewers would find him a selfish guy, stealing money from the bank and living lazily, ignoring the news report on the people in trouble, and here the film makes an interesting point - not everyone would behave like Spider-man given a chance to use superpower. His reference to comic books when he asks another jumper (played by Jamie Bell) to help suggests that the filmmakers are aware of that aspect.    But except the jumper Jamie Bell plays (and he is much more interesting than Christensen), none of the characters have been developed enough to draw our attention to the film's world. Rachel Bilson is there to constantly ask the hero what is going on, but nothing more is required. Michael Rooker and Diane Lane, both real professionals, look bored. Visual effects are OK and various locations (especially Rome) are joy to see, but they alone would not make up for the bland hero who refuses to interest us.    And the hero refuses to learn anything from the past experiences. He doesn't know how to defend himself when paladins show up and he puts his girlfriend in danger more than once. Probably that's why Jamie Bell's jumper, who is smart and knows how to survive, is more interesting. Unfortunately he appears on the screen too late and his character is only a supporting role.
B000MRAAJM|1.0|The HD-DVD and Blu-ray versions lack the \\"110 minutes of 'behind the scene' footege\\" + a documentary entitled \\"Planet Earth -- The Future\\". Full descriptions of these from amazon's websites are as follows:    \\"DVD Features:  110 minutes of behind the scenes footage - one 10-minute behind the scenes program for each episode (SD release only)    Documentary:Planet Earth - The Future: This 3-part, 2 1/2 hour series looks at what the future may hold for endangered animals, habitats and -- ultimately -- ourselves. Following the environmental issues raised by Planet Earth, it asks why so many species are threatened and how they can be protected in future. (SD release only)\\"    My friend bought the DVD set as a gift, and we started to watch this extraordinarily exceptional documentary series. Among all other things, the part that we most liked was those \\"behind the scene footages\\" because there are some utterly and literally unbelievable scenes captured that make you wonder how they were captured, and after each episode these footages tell you about the techniques used for videotaping. As a frequent documentary watcher, I was really puzzled with how these series were videotaped, and the footages shed light to many things.    Since I liked this series very much, I went to BestBuy and quarelled with a sales associate for the exhange of this DVD set with the Blu-ray one. Eventually I win, but when I came to my apartment, ultimately she won, because the footages were missing in the Blu-ray edition!!!    BBC, first and foremost, what made you think that Blu-ray player owners do not require or less require the bonus feautres??    Second, if you ever had to consider whether DVD player owners or Blu-ray player owners less need the bonus feautres, then how come you voted against the latter?? After all the bonus feautres constantly praise how you videotaped in HD!!    As to the narrators, I have not watched the series on TV, nevertheless I share the same opinion with others, as a non-American.    Why are you compelling these guys to watch the series in British English. I could respec`t your decision if you had sticked to British English for the TV broadcasting. But broadcasting with a U.S. narrator and then releasing the DVD with a Brit narrator is simply deceiving people.    Anyhow, for the prospective buyers I will, irrespective of the HD quality, recommend the DVD set instead of Blu-ray. Believe me, the DVD series was also very nice. Not to mention that another reviewer comments that the visual quality on this Blu-ray is far worse than the then TV broadcasting. He relies his facts on the encoding. I don't know whether he is true or not, but it is better to consider his comments as well.

B00005YXZH|5.0|Yankee Hotel Foxtrot was my first experience with Wilco, after much advisement from a friend.  I have to say, I was not disappointed. My expectations were not only met, but far surpassed.  This is a truly amazing album.  Right from the first two songs, I was hooked and the rest of the album was just as entertaining.  Yankee Hotel Foxtrot really flows in a way few albums do.  Wilco managed to put together a dozen songs that, while all maintaining a similar feel, are entirely unique to each other and enjoyable for completely different reasons.  Every song by itself is a reason to own this album, luckily for us they're all on one CD.

B0013FBS20|4.0|Blu ray prices for new blu ray movies run on avg about 27.95, hd dvd going out of business and having huge sales marked I am Legend upon release to 18.95, so Blu Ray adds some nails to the coffin and does the same.    Now the film, I'm some beers deep as I write this and there are some plot holes as said beer wears off, however it is a good time.  This graphic novel for a hollywood movie doesn't go 100% sappy or happy ending on us, it shows pain.  Also cash cow Will Smith isn't such a cliche character.  Speaking on Will Smith he is a good cryer, along the lines of Mel Gibson.  I knew this ever since Fresh Prince when Carlton accidently took pills from Will's locker and needed his stomach pumped, or when his dad didn't show up when he was supposed to, Will Smith crying can get to you, he is a good actor.  Besides being a good actor as I mentioned he is a cash cow every film he is makes around $100 mil, with I am Legend topping $200 mil, Adam Sandler is another safe bet at the box office, although I'm not loving his movies.   I expected amazing sound out of this blu ray, however the movie isn't trying to be transformers, it's the end of the world, how loud could it be?  And it isn't, if you saw this in the theaters and had a talker in your midst I feel for you.  The Film does take it's time and let's us feel the movie as opposed to attempting to be a cure for add for the entire time it is on the screen.    As for hollywood movies this one is a good time, and a worthy add to a collection, especially at this price when compared to other new releases.  And Amazon has a tendency to up prices here and there so I wouldn't gather it'll stay this way for long.  So I'm going to buy it, and I'll list the dvd features later.  Thanks for reading, I am out.

B000I2J2WM|4.0|\\"Unbelievable\\", it was the firt words that came to me watching the first minutes as those fabulous cars where roaring their engines in Monaco.    Not the movie of the century, but one excellent movie about cars and especially formula 1 in the times of Clark, Hill and Brabham, lack of seat belts and all the specifics about formula 1 old era.    Why an awesome HD experience ? You think a 1966 movie can't be that impressive ? In fact, it was fully captured with 65mm film, which makes it easy for a blow-up-your-hd-display transfer.    A must-have for Racing-movie buffs and high definition lovers.

That's not what I got.  I was enthralled with this film.  It is a complicated and humanistic film that will touch you and make you think in unexpected directions.  Very well-acted.  Nice ending, not too sweet, not too sour.  Really enjoyable movie. Highly recommended as an epic historical action film.
B000059Z8J|5.0|I saw this film in theaters way back in '78! I loved it then and it holds up quite well today. The FX are great for the time and for the most part look fine. Reeve's gave Clark Kent/Superman so much character and to me he will always be Superman. This is a very entertaining film and it's doesn't take itself too seriously. Lots of humor and terrific performances by all the key players.<br /><br />If I have one or two complaints it's that the Superman and Lois flying sequence is too long and I didn't like the whole \\"turning back time\\" segment at the end. I would have liked to have the movie spend a little more time on Clark's youth too. These are small grievances and I love this film regardless giving it 4 1/2 stars. It's a shame that 'Superman Returns' didn't have this much charm. I am reviewing this film on the individual release, but own and watched the newer Superman box set.

0380820846|3.0|I've read a few of Julia Quinn's books and they're pretty good. This one was OK. A decent read. I did skip parts trying to get to the sections where the hero/heroine would interact. The romance was just lukewarm. I did enjoy the ONE love scene though. There just seems to be something missing from certain books that would take it from being just good, to great. This book seemed to be more focused on the secondary story of unmasking Whistledown than to the budding relationship of Penelope and Colin.
0156030306|4.0|It was a provocative and well written book. Both my teens also read and enjoyed it.  I cringed at the look into how society treats mentally challenged individuals.  The main characters have to make incredibly difficult and thought provoking choices.  I cried at the end.  It is short but has enough meat to be a great book club choice.
B0015XHQTY|4.0|The Enforcer is the second sequel to Dirty Harry.  In this installment, Harry Callahan, the renegade cop with some old-fashioned attitudes and no desire to be tied up with a partner, gets stuck with a female partner, well played by Tyne Daly.  Surprise surprise, he learns to respect and rely on her as they make hamburger of a group of domestic terrorists.  As in the first two movies, there's plenty of action, suspense, people getting shot, etc., but with a chase on foot in place of the usual car chase.<br /><br />Whether those with the older DVD will want to upgrade is a matter of personal preference, but the special features look attractive to me:<br /><br />-- new commentary by Enforcer director James Fargo<br />-- new featurette \\"The Business End: Violence in Cinema\\"<br />-- \\"Harry Callahan/Clint Eastwood: Something Special in Films\\"<br />-- trailer gallery<br /><br />This and the other four movies are available on standard DVD both separately and in a 7-disc [[ASIN:B0015XHQTE Ultimate Collector's Edition]], which has additional goodies.<br /><br />They're also on Blu-ray in a 5-disc [[ASIN:B001608QVS Ultimate Collector's Edition]].

0143038419|5.0|I enjoyed this book.  It is divided in to short sections so it's easy to put down and pick up again.  I really liked her accepting attitude.  She is open to other religions and cultures.  She doesn't force her views on you.  The fundamental Christians in my reading group did not like this book at all!  Those of us who are more open minded and don't think we have all the answers enjoyed it.
0452289963|5.0|Eckhart Tolle is an insightful, inspired writer who has much to say to today's world. Everyone should read this book and his first one, The Power of Now. He teaches so much to us all about how to think and what our ego's are doing to us.    Thank you Mr. Tolle for a TRULY amazing book!

B0007IN318|4.0|Interesting view of how Romans lived just before Pompeii blew.  The explination of how water was moved great distances duing a time when many people think there wasn't much in the way of technology.  To calculate the drop over run sufficent to move water at just the correct rate was indeed a great piece of engineering.  Oh by the way the love story isn't all the bad either.
B000OVLBF8|4.0|If you see one super hero movie you pretty much see them all.  They become, they see danger, they fight, they conquer.  Anyone going to see this type of movie should know what to expect. I am not that much a fan of this<br />type of genre but there are some I like, some I don't.  This one I did like.  It had good special effects that were done well, although not an abundance of them, and there were enough surprise jump scenes that might satisfy the \\"scare me\\" crowd.  The suspense and figure me out scenes kept me interested but it would have been nice to have a little more interwoven into story. Putting Cage in black hair was a bit of shock for me at first but once I stopped dwelling on the weave and color change I got into his character and did not notice it after that.<br />What I liked about Ghost Rider was that it was pretty OK for the entire family of 12 years on up.  Some of the \\"demons\\" may be too scary for younger kids.  Over all it was better on the big screen (of course) but enjoyable entertainment over all.  I have seen far worse movies this year and many better, but you can get OSCAR material out every movie, can you?
B0001XAPZ6|4.0|Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind (1985) - Hayao Miyazaki    There really needs to be something said about the work of Hayao Miyazaki.  His completely unique vision and overall creativity has manifested in possibly the most amazing streak of great animated films ever produced.  In fact, it even gives early Disney, renaissance era Disney, and modern day Pixar a fight.  His body of work is truly astounding.  He just about never fails to deliver an extremely engaging story filled with wonderful characters and amazing visuals, and with Nausicaa, he succeeds once again.    This is without a doubt one of his best films, although it has an overall different feel and tone when compared to some of his later masterworks.  I have read a few critics calling it less refined than some of his later works, such as Mononoke and Spirited Away, but I don't think they really know what they're talking about.  I'm almost certain that the more subdued overall feel is a choice, and never does the film feel \\"clunky\\", which is what one reviewer called it.  Now, what does this overall slower pace and muted tone lead to?  For one, it leads to a more meditative feel, which fits this film perfectly because, thematically, Nausicaa is probably Miyazaki's strongest.  It deals with the situation of man vs. nature and pacifism vs. war.  It's clear that Miyazaki strongly believes in pacifism over violence and he displays it beautifully through the main character of Nausicaa, who has to be one of the greatest heroines in all of film.  The choices and sacrifices she makes throughout the narrative create a genuine inspiration within the viewer that is hard to contain.    Oh, and there's the visuals.  Miyazaki is a master of visual art, bottom line.  His creativity is absolutely amazing; he is able to create worlds filled with so much detail that they almost appear real, even if they occur only in dreams.  The cavern of petrified trees below the Sea of Decay, in particular, is absolutely stunning.  Thus,in summary, please buy this movie.  You will not be disappointed.    On an interesting note, all of my friends that have read both the manga and watched the movie unanimously agree that the manga is infinitely superior, which is a little frightening, considering how good the movie is.
0061122416|5.0|How is it possible that a simple tale of a shepherd boy can affect so many people over the course of the fifteen years since this book was published? Is it merely due to the fact that Paolo Coehlo addresses a major theme like following your destiny? Or is it because he tenderly writes about love and personal growth? Perhaps it's those moments when he juxtaposes the world of intellect versus the world of intuition? If this were a multiple-choice quiz  - I'd have to answer  \\"all of the above\\". \\"The Alchemist\\" has something for everyone - Add me to the list of admirers!    Stories that touch on so many key life themes don't come around too often. I'm fortunate to have found another book as well that I wholeheartedly recommend: [[ASIN:1888043180 Being Here: Modern Day Tales of Enlightenment]]. The authors, Ariel and Shya Kane, offer a new possibility of looking to live one's life in the moment. It's amazing how instantaneous transformation can take place regarding one's destiny and personal growth when the \\"present\\" is seen as a \\"gift\\".  Put both of these works on your bookshelf - you won't regret it!
B000XCZGV8|5.0|After I saw the Zodiac, which I really enjoyed, on DVD in 2007 (rental) I did some research and read that at a later date this Special Edition was being released with a new movie length documentary featuring the actual investigators and surviving victims. It was worth the wait. Luckily, I had purchased a laptop with an HD-DVD player. Format wars aside, it is worth the price just for the extras included. The detectives and survivors will have you hanging on every word. The detectives go over crime scenes in pretty good detail telling of little things that still stick in their minds about the crime scenes. Every one of the suspected Zodiac killings are gone over in the documentary, including ones that were not recreated in the movie. The documentary also has photos that have probably never been seen before of evidence (that are new) as well as police shots of crime scenes. Interwoven into the documentary are old news clips of survivor interviews and police press conferences.  And victims look back and tell what happened and how it effected their lives over the years. Excellent, excellent production quality with state of the art graphics being used for recreations. Also this was the first high definition DVD of either Blue Ray or HD-DVD that I have seen were all the extra features were also in HD.<br /><br />For those that are interested in true crime, historical events, or the Zodiac (regardless of your theories on who he was)you need this in your DVD library if just for the documentaries (there is one also on the Zodiac's identity). If you don't have an HD-DVD player I would think it may be released in Blue Ray at a later date since that is now the standard so keep tabs on that.
1592332803|5.0|This past weekend I tried out my first recipes from this book (Chocolate Cake page 72 & Buttercream Frosting page 231).  I made the dessert for 4 non-vegetarians/vegans.  I've tried to veganize baked goods myself in the past and  have just not had a lot of luck with textures and consistencies.  I  bought this book because I hoped I'd be able to bake things my whole  (non-veg) family would enjoy that I could feel good about making.   Baking homemade birthday cakes is my absolute favorite thing to do in  the kitchen.    I was so thrilled to see not only how easy this cake was but how  great it tasted, looked and felt.  The cake was moist and flavorful  and the frosting was a huge hit with my extended family (lots of  licking of beaters).  I even got to lick the cake batter bowl which with non-vegan batter that contains eggs no one should really do but especially a pregnant lady.  The batter was so good!    I see that some reviewers think this book is too basic or not experimental enough.  But our family is on an EXTREMELY tight budget.  Would I like to use all kinds of cool, hard-to-find ingredients in recipes?  Sure.  But the reality for us is that we have to keep our pantry stocked with the basics.  To be able to bake vegan desserts that everyone likes on my budget is fantastic.    I can't wait to try out more recipes.  I have about 1/3 of the pages folded down for that purpose.  With a holiday this weekend, I'm sure I'll find something fun to make for a group of 10 non-veg folks.
B000YABYLA|5.0|Ellen Page couldn't have done any better rendering her role in the movie. No wonder she was nominated the best actress for the Grammy's. Unlike the always predictable Hollywood movie plot, this film is more than just a love story; it also reflects many conflicts we face in our lives and society. This is one of the few movies I feel worthy of owning and would watch over and over again.

0452287588|3.0|Tolle writes poetically and I have no doubt that many people will find the insights literally life changing.  Many, on the other hand, will recognize that Tolle's concepts are nothing new.  Psychologists, self-help gurus, and spiritualists, to name a few, have theorized and written about these ideas in various forms, many times in the past.  For those that are new to soul searching, I do recommend this book.    I suggest, however, that the reader remain realistic in their expectations.  We are Human Beings.  The human experience is one of emotions, challenges, highs and lows!  We cannot know who we are without knowing and experiencing others.  We cannot appreciate the \\"good\\" times without knowing the \\"bad\\" times.  Too often human beings are afraid to feel anything other than happiness and joy, in fact, they do everything to avoid pain and discomfort.  This is how we develop addictive, disordered, dysfunctional and/or destructive behavior.  No one, including Tolle, can or is guaranteeing you a quick fix or an escape from life's ups and downs.  That's what Being Human is about.
1572814349|5.0|Hello,  Just wanted to give a little bit of my opinion on the Golden Tarot deck. I absolutely love this deck, it has really made a stong impression on me and I am quickly developing that strong connection to it. The readings are greatly enhanced by researching card meanings online. I felt that the booklet that explains each card was vaugue, limited, and quite frankly pretty skewed for some of the cards. I did some online research of several different sites and was able to compile my own meaning list, that I feel has given my readings so much more depth and accuracy. Anyway the cards are a bit less vibrant than I expected even after reading the reviews, but I really like the imagery, and I really feel that many of them have a deep spiritual resounance. I love them.
0749324791|4.0|I picked this book up after I finished Lucy Sullivan is Getting Married.  Like Lucy Sullivan, I enjoyed Marian Keyes chatty style.  Reading this book feels like a chat with a friend and I found that I got to know the main character very well.  Marian Keyes excels at character development.<br /><br />As you probably know, this story is about Claire, a 29 year old Irish woman living in London.  A few hours after she gave birth, her husband James announces that he doesn't love her anymore and that he is leaving her for another woman.  Devastated, Claire left London for her family in Dublin.  In Dublin we experience with Claire her stages of \\"mourning,\\" which seem quite accurate for a woman in her predicament.  First, she wants her husband to come back to her and for everything to return how it was, then she is angry, and then she finds acceptance.  As Claire goes on with her life and meets someone knew, her husband James pops back into her life and wants her back.  Claire contemplates taking him back because she wants to have the perfect family and her old life back.  In the end, she realizes that she cannot forgive her husband.  The book is a predictable plotline, of course, but what is special about it is how Claire wrestles with her changing perception of her husband and herself.  She realizes that she had placed her husband on a pedestal and she figures out that he was really not the guy she thought he was.<br /><br />Yes, Claire gets annoying at times.  Don't we all? And aren't most poeple who go through big breakups kind of selfish and self-centered?  The fact is, Claire is a very real person.  She has her flaws and faults, but the reader grows to care about her.<br /><br />I gave this book four stars because some sections were kind of wordy and at some points (e.g. the baggage claim scene when Claire first arrives in Dublin) where it looks like the author is trying too hard to be funny.  But this is a fantastic book if you are looking for a light, funny read.

0452289963|2.0|In my 2007 novel The Seeker Academy, my hero Grace Hudson reacts from the heart to a teaching very like Tolle's:<br /><br />Sophie gave Grace a layered smile. She picked her sack up by an edge, peeked in, and pulled out a notebook. \\"I'd best read this to you. Try to sit tight for another minute.<br /><br />\\"Never mind for now where I got this... but of transcendence it says\\"-she read from her notebook-\\"that it's a deepening of attachment without concern for worldly illusions. It bypasses the laws of cause and effect and clings to the experience of awakened spirituality. While any feeling can lead to direct experience, including the compassion a cause-and-effect world creates, if you strip away the feelings, the attachments that lead to the experiences, you see you aren't alone. This lets you give up life more fully. You see how all experience, including suffering, feeling pain, say, from cancer or injustice, fits in a spiritual script that unfolds perfectly. It is even joyful to watch. To wake into transcendence is to see that one's suffering ultimately isn't real.'\\"<br /><br />\\"To me,\\" responded Grace, fiercely, \\"this is all about fear. It's about bailing psychological water with a sad little bucket while your very real lifeboat is beginning to sink....  I'm also shocked at how much these ideas repel me.\\"<br /><br />\\"Yet they've been taught through the ages. In one way or another, many religions preach god's perfection and charity and the pain-causing illusions of human selfhood and perception.\\"<br /><br />\\"Where exactly does `charity' come in?\\"<br /><br />\\"In our ability to be spiritually awake... some call this `an act of god's forgiveness.'\\"<br /><br />\\"We are to be forgiven for becoming what god created us to be?\\"<br /><br />Sophie, having announced her own misgivings, was quiet.<br /><br />\\"Though I see how scared people will want forgiveness,\\" said Grace.<br /><br />\\"There's too much fear and suffering,\\" Sophie said.

B000I5Y8ZU|5.0|As a proud 34-year-old fan of My Chemical Romance, among all the others who are half my age, I must say - go Gerard and company.  This album is one of their best.  One of my favorite tracks is \\"Teenagers.\\"  I love MCR!
B000R7I3LY|5.0|I bought this CD for my husband for our anniversary.  He worked with Sara a couple times at UCLA Spring Sing where one year she sang Gravity and won the all around prize.  We can't say we were surprised when she hit it big.  Love Song and Gravity are worth the price of the CD alone (we usually follow the 3-song rule when buying a CD, but even just these two do it in this case), but the other songs are all great as well, so splurge on the whole thing, not just those downloads.  And on top of being incredibly talented, she's a super nice person, so you can feel great about contributing to her success!  Enjoy the CD.

0743564413|1.0|The review of this book should be one of great raving and wonderful words.  Hemingway is a classic writer and revered by many and has earned his place in the literary world.  For me, this book is very dry and drawn out.  It is slow moving and the point of the story is hard to decipher.<br /><br />Jake Barnes is a writer and Lady Brett Ashley is wealthy and goes through her life drinking and with no purpose.  The story describes their relationship and lives.  The story did not hold my attention and was not one that caused me to stay up all night to finish reading.<br /><br />William Hurt is a good actor but as a reader his inflection did not work for me.  I had a difficult time telling which character was which by voice alone.<br /><br />All in all, I am more interested in writers of mystery, crime and science fiction than I am in a classic author.

B00005JPTK|4.0|Unlike most of the other reviews, I have not seen any of the other incarnations of the novel, nor have I read the actual novel. I saw the preview for this movie and it piqued my interest.  I saw the movie first in the theater and, like most people, was blown away by Will Smith's performance.  (I know that horror movies are rarely in contention for Oscar's, but I feel Will's performance was Oscar worthy.)  The movie itself was very good, although in the theatrical version, i wasn't totally clear on the reason for 'Fred' being moved, and from that point on, the theatrical version for me was not as great as it could have been.  Maybe my imagination failed me that day in the theater.  Then i purchased the two-disc version.  i was BLOWN AWAY by the 'alternative' version.  Keeping in mind I have not read the novel or seen the other versions, the 'alternative version' on this DVD package was the story I was hoping to see.  This time, with clearer understanding of the events that happen after (and around) the 'Fred' incident, the movie did not let go.  This again shows that studio execs. do NOT understand the movie going audience.  I do not see this ending as 'controversial', but rather hopeful.  The Alpha Male's actions lend hope to the society of vampires/Zombies...maybe not in the 'cheesy all's well that ends well' kind of ending hollywood is known for, but in a 'this is the way life has progressed, lets make the best of it' kind of way.   Yes, this movie does borrow from stories like  28 days later, but (like 28 days) has the desire to show that life is not a hollywood 'romanticized' ending, but a real world where life happens and humanity must learn to adapt.  As far as the CGI effects for the vampires/zombies, I feel they enhanced (both) versions of the story.  I did not feel they were a distraction or even noticeable, other then knowing now-adays, CGI is the way to produce these kinds of effects.  Think about it : would it have been better to see human/stunt men perform some of the movements, which would have made teh monsters HUMAN and thereby fallible, or CGI i them, making them capable of superhuman actions.  And that effect also shows the juxtaposition of the movie - while Robert (Smith) continues to 'live' in a real world, the zombies have 'evolved' to a new realm, creating a heigherarcy he cannot compete with.
0143038419|1.0|I think it is so sad that so many women read and got inspiration from this book.  What is happening to the minds of our women?  It's like people will just grab at anything!!  I had a very hard time finishing the book, but did and was so mad at the time I wasted doing so.  I guess this woman is typical of the thinking of the weak, lost and ignorant!
1582701709|1.0|Disappointing, especially if you are wanting to read something that lives up to all the hype. I thought the book was very simplistic and shallow. If you must read it then I suggest checking it out of the library, but please don't spend your money on a personal copy until you're sure about it.
075640407X|5.0|What a delightful surprise this book turned out to be.  The world that Patrick Rothfuss has created is fully formed and wonderful to inhabit.  I found myself slowly sucked into the world and the lives of the characters and could not extricate myself.  I suggest you DO NOT begin to read it the night before a big test or work conference.  You won't be able to put it down and will be up all night reading!  I cannot wait for the next installment to be released.
006135323X|4.0|I was also one of Dan Ariely's students this fall, so while I was lucky to have had my reading complemented by lectures and in-class experiments, the book itself was good enough that I read it twice.  While the insight here is not that people are irrational--as other reviewers have postulated--that is a well-known fact of life. Otherwise, we would all recycle, eat healthy foods, exercise, and \\"Deal or No Deal\\" would never be a supenseful television show. What is interesting is Dan's insights into the common and predictable nature of these quirks of human nature. I actually found this book very inspiring rather than depressing, because Dan shows us that we can actually understand humans' strange behavior and change our collective paradigm so that we work with, not against, these forces. The implications for people in law enforcement, policy, product development, teaching, and nearly any other walk of life are vast and exciting. In short, I highly recommend this book because it is both entertaining and informational.  Enjoy!
0060989157|3.0|Just joking. My first concert ever was Motley Crue at Madison Square Garden back in 1987 and I still remember all those feelings of awe, rebellion, excitement and raging hormones they inspired to my 13 year old psyche and I suppose they were doing a good job of being rockstars since they accomplished all of that for me. And maybe it's the memory of how they made me feel as a young teenager (before I knew what really good music was) that gives me the mixed emotions I have about this book. These guys are spoiled rotten, ego-maniacal, mediocre musicians who happened to capitalize on a \\"look\\" and \\"sound\\" in a pretty bad musical era that decided its heroes based on how high they could tease their hair. If they'd come on the scene a decade later, they would have been laughed at. Their antics are child-like, their drug-abuse and womanizing is nothing more than a rock cliche, and their ability as musicians is minimal. They take themselves (and their music WAY too seriously) and I can't help but notice how their music really isn't the center of their attention in this account. Music seems to be a means of getting what they're really after: drugs, whores, ego and money. It occurs to me that any serious musician writing his memoirs would spend more time talking about his life's work than bragging about how he and some groupies gave new meaning to the AT&T phrase, \\"reach out and touch someone\\" or boasting about snorting Ozzy's urine through a cocaine straw.     Despite all that, I have to say that somehow, this book was humorous and entertaining and will definitely give you a good laugh at just how gluttonous and sleazy the music industry was in the 1980s. After this read, you will suddenly feel nostalgic enough to tease your hair and go and download Shout at the Devil,just for old times sake.

In my opinion you have to be a pretty big fan of Nirvana to fully appreciate this album.  I give it a 4 because, as a Nirvana fan, I love their sound and love the vibe I get from their music.  I did not give it a 5 because the occasional listener will not and cannot appreciate it as much as a Nirvana fan.
0375842209|5.0|Yes, we know a great deal about Germany during WWII.  And yes, we've read lots of novels about the average German citizen during this period.  But, absolutely NO!, this novel is not like the rest; it will grab you, hold you captive, and only release you when it's finished, and you will be sad because of that.  THe characters are real and touch your heart, and will remain with you long after you have put the book down.  And though it's recommended for young adults, please beleve it's intended for us all.

0446619078|4.0|This is an older work by Connelly (copyright 1995) that I had not previously seen, though I believe I have read all the other Connelly novels. This one begins with Harry Bosch having been placed on ISL (Involuntary Stress Leave) after attacking Lieutenant Harvey \\"98\\" Pounds. Somewhat in cahoots with his department-assigned counselor, he decides finally to look into the murder of his mother, a case that had never been solved. As usually happens when long-hidden secrets begin to be pulled into the light of day, all hell breaks loose.    In the end, Harry solves his mother's murder, but a pile of bodies, and Harry's own sense of guilt, make the reader realize that the things we think are necessary for our ultimate healing may instead only add further wounds.    Gave me another great evocative line for my \\"loneliness\\" notebook: \\"Loneliness is the trashcan fire I had huddled around for most of my life.\\" (I'm citing it from memory, so it might not be precise, but it's close enough.)
B000GIXEIG|3.0|I enjoy many different types of movies but this one appealed to me mainly because Gerard Butler was the lead. I really was not to impressed with the movie as far as its entertainment value goes but I did enjoy watching Gerard, he is an excellent actor. For his die hard fans a much better movie is 300.
B0001WTWCO|1.0|I actually watched this film twice because the reviews were good and I thought I must have missed something. The first time I had trouble paying attention it was so dull. The second time I had trouble staying awake. I have seen it twice and don't even recall what it was about. Why do people like this film?
B000V8I2QU|1.0|I liked Born to run and Darkness on the edge of town. Born in the USA however was a disaster from my point of view. Then Bruce came up with the fantastic We shall overcome so I was a bit excided that this would be good to but no. When I listen to this Magic I feel that this is the kind of music I loved when I was 16. The boring jingle bells even still there! So from my opinion this is a disappoinment.
B000PFU7OO|5.0|First point:    The movie Once features a number of great Irish musicians, apart from just the two leading actors.  The singing bank manager is Sean Millar.  His `nom de plume' is Dr Millar, he has released several albums under this name.  They are all excellent, however I would highly recommend `Always Coming Home', an album with beautiful music and superb lyrics.  You will not find this on Amazon, but it should be available elsewhere on the web.  Also in the movie is Fergus O'Farrell, of the very good Irish band Interference, who sings at the house party.  His song is on the Once soundrack.      Second point:     For what its worth, The Frames have an excellent back catalogue of albums.  IMHO, the pick of the bunch are 'Fitzcarraldo', 'Dance The Devil' and 'For the Birds'.    The song `Say it to me now' on the soundtrack is from the album \\"Fitzcarraldo\\", as is 'Revelate', which is one of the Frames' most famous songs.      \\"Dance the Devil\\" has God Bless Mom which is an incredible tune played live.  All the tracks on this album are quite strong.         \\"For The Birds\\" is a more acoustic style album. The opening track `In the Deep Shade' is just instruments, no vocals.  It features an excellent American piano player called Rachel Grimes and is one of my favourite pieces of music. On the same album 'Santa Maria' and 'When the Heart Just Stops are also personal faovurites', though again all the tracks here are quite strong.
B000UR366S|2.0|You won't find a bigger fan of Joni Mitchell's work from her self-titled 1st album through Court and Spark (and to a lesser degree through Hejira)(sp?) than me, but save your money on this one. I hate to say this, but the main thing that shines here is the whining of an artist that dwells too much on the negative and the bitter. Ms. Mitchell: I know the world is a mess and there are a lot of bad guys out there, but is it not too late to lighten up a little bit sometimes?

006091307X|4.0|This book just feels nice, really.  While the cover's texture is not the most interesting, it makes up for this by being quite flexible, and the binding is perfect.    Like most paperbacks of this sort, the paper it is printed on is anything but mindblowing.  Still, it is heavier than most, and the typeface is delightfully clear.    While the graphic design of the cover is relevant, I am not sure that it is effective in a buy-for-its-cover kinda way.  The design on the spine is awfully nice, though, so it may very well fit on your bookshelf.
0201721481|5.0|A great improvement over previous editions - presents a very good balance of introductory and advanced topics.  It served my purpose extremely well as a refresher to C++ after several years.  Certainly, Stroustrup offers better coverage of more complex topics - however, as a general purpose textbook, this is good.  Indispensable to me, more so than the second edition that I was still using.  If you are a beginner or an exprerienced C++ programmer looking for a refresher, this is a good book.  If you rate yourself as an advanced C++ programmer, you can save it for that day when you start to forget things!

0425080021|5.0|Dune (1965) is the first SF novel in this series.  Paul Atreides was born to Duke Leto Atreides and the Lady Jessica in the 57th year of the Padishah Emperor Shaddim IV.  For his first fifteen years, Paul lived on Caladan, the Atreides home planet.  Then the Emperor exchanged Arrakis -- Dune -- for Caladan.    In this novel, Duke Leto is a leader of men and sees Arrakis as an opportunity to expose the former possessors -- the Harkonnens -- as incompetents.  Arrakis is the only planet that produces Melange, popularly known as Spice.  The substance allows Guild Navigators to guide ships between the stars and extends the life of any who can afford it.    Duke Leto also sees a great opportunity in the Fremen, the dwellers of the Arrakis desert.  The Harkonnens have hunted the Fremen for sport and consider them to be native trash.  But the Duke knows that the Fremen are potentially as deadly as the most elite force within the Empire, the Sardaukar.    The Duke and his retainers are preparing for the move.  Yet Paul is being prepared for something else.  Reverend Mother Gaius Helen Mohiam has come to Caladan to test him with the gom jabbar.    The Bene Gesserit have been breeding for a Kwisatz Haderach, a person with unusual talents and a strange destiny.  The first step in testing for such a person is the gom jabbar, the test of pain.  When Paul inserts his hand into the box, he fells as if his hand is being burned to a blackened stump.    His mother Jessica knows that he will be subjected to extreme pain, but she doesn't question the need.  She has been trained by the Bene Gesserit and accepts their goals.  Yet she was ordered to produce a girl child and she is not quite certain why she had disobeyed.    Baron Vladimir Harkonnen sees the turnover of Arrakis as an opportunity to destroy Duke Leto.  He and Piter -- his Mentat -- brief his nephew Feyd-Rautha on the plan.  But the Baron and his Mentat can't converse without bickering.  Feyd-Rautha would rather be elsewherethan to witness their quarreling.    Wellington Yueh is a Suk Doctor in the household of Duke Leto.  The Baron Harkonnen has captured His wife Wanda and is pressing the doctor to kidnap Paul.  The doctor has convenient access to Paul and is trusted by the Atreides.    In this story, the Atreides take their household and possessions to Arrakis on a Guild freighter.  Rather than occupying Carthage -- the former Harkonnen capitol -- the Atreides land in Arrakeen, which  Thufir Hawat -- the Duke's Mentat -- has decided is more defensible.  The Atreides family resides in the household of Count Hasimir Fenring.    The Atreides contact the Fremen and learn of a Harkonnen force disguised as Fremen.  Duncan Idaho and his men take the Harkonnens captive, but the Harkonnens severely wound the Fremen courier.  He dies in transit to the Atreides medical facility.    Stilgar -- chief of a Fremen sietch -- comes to Leto to evaluate him.  He honors Leto enough to give him permission to unsheath a crysknife found near the courier.  Duke Leto then gives Duncan Idaho leave to return to the sietch with Stilgar.    This story tells of the death of Duke Leto and the transfer of loyalty of his men to Paul.  It takes Paul to the Fremen and makes him one of them.  It lays the foundations of the fall of the Empire and the rise of the God-King.    This novel is only the first of a great series.  It creates a very fascinating universe that is still being read and expanded.  It may be the best of the author's works, if only for its great scope and backstory.    Highly recommended for Herbert fans and for anyone else who enjoys tales of exotic societies, political intrigue and strange powers.    -Arthur W. Jordin
0380973839|5.0|Ray Bradbury is a timeless author. His storytelling borders on poetic. The Martian Chronicles was the first book of his I had ever read. After 15 years I just completed my second reading and am no less moved by his work.<br /><br />A lot is accomplished in this short work of science fiction and fantasy. Its opening chapters center around Earthmen attempting to land on Mars and communicate with its not so welcoming inhabitants. As the book progresses war on Earth makes Mars either a refuge or an asylum, depending upon one's point of view. The final chapter of this book is particularly moving. The final page, the final few paragraphs send shivers down my spine and cause me to pause in wonder.<br /><br />As an added side note, there is one chapter titled Usher II and involves a man who constructs a house replete with images and scenes from Edgar Alan Poe's stories. This is just an added bonus to us Poe fans.<br /><br />I do recommend this to anyone, especially as an introduction to Bradbury's work. While not hardcore science fiction, it definitely has many similar elements that make the genre so compelling.
B000PC0S5K|3.0|I purchased this book as I enjoy delving in to intellectual discussion regarding pretty much anything and everything that may prove to have a healthy impact on my views of self, world, and God. Admittedly, I was drawn to this writing through Oprah. No, I'm not an Oprah-fanatic but she does market Mr. Tolle quite well. My first impressions of the book were along the lines of \\"Oh dear, this is going to be a tedious read.\\" The words flow in a frantic/manic manner and I can only digest small portions of it at a time before I start zoning out on the meaning behind the words. This may be a good thing because I am \\"studying\\" it more than \\"reading\\" it. BUT, I have to say that - so far - it's not brought anything new to my life that I hadn't stumbled upon in the \\"Peaceful Warrior\\" series that I read eons ago....or the \\"Conversaions with God\\" books....or \\"Wherever You Go, There You Are: Mindfulness Meditation in Everyday Life\\"....and probably several other similar writings. These other books I mention actually filled me with energy and excitement - awakenings to what's inside the self as well as what goes out in to the universe. \\"A New Earth\\" has yet to fill me with the same type of \\"WOW\\" moments of awakening or understanding. I've honestly found myself thinking, \\"yep, read that thought process before - and it was written by the other person with a heck of alot more inspiration.\\" BUT....I'm hanging in there - studying (not reading)- the material as it has the potential of having a positive and healthy impact on my life and those around me (as does any spoken or written word).

His style leaves a hint of mystery to his characters and world that carries through the entire trilogy. I bought it becuase a friend told me that it has the most satisfying ending to a trilogy that she'd ever read, and it didn't disappoint.    The only point I disagreed with her on is that Mogget is cooler than the Disreputable Dog. Not by much, but enough.

1594489505|4.0|I read this book because it was suggested reading in a Women's Magazine I was leafing through while on my lunch break at work. I so therefore bought this book and started reading.  Well it didnt take me to long to fall in love with Khaled Hossani's writing and ways of describing his home country.  I feel like the burqua has been lifted and we can finally see what all the commotion is about. As a married woman with children I cannot imagine living life as a woman in that country.  I feel  so much for them and the abuse they have to suffer under the Taliban.  OH but such drama and poignancy with regards to secrets and life becoming full circle.  You have to pick up a copy of this book to broaden your experience of the Middle East and the customs and brutality with regards to laws there and the treatment of women in general.  I am looking forward to reviewing The Kite Runner.  I read his second novel before his first and I am on the way to the first one now to write that review.
B0010X73ZG|4.0|In 1920, H. P. Lovecraft wrote a short story called From Beyond about an alien environment inhabited by horrific creatures that overlaps with our own environment. Stephen King often gives credit to Lovecraft as inspiration for his Horror writings (see [[ASIN:042518160X Stephen King's Danse Macabre]]).<br /><br />Therefore, it's no surprise--and perhaps not a coincidence--that King wrote a story circa 1980 called The Mist that explores what might happen if a window to that alien environment was inadvertently opened...wide...releasing a dense mist filled with monsters. (The Mist was later published in one of King's collection of short stories called [[ASIN:0451168615 Skeleton Crew]] {1985}.)<br /><br />Fast forward to the late 2007 release of a feature film adaptation of The Mist. But what's really interesting is that the director of The Mist is the same guy that directed [[ASIN:B0002J4ZWS The Shawshank Redemption]]...Frank Darabont...so my expectations for The Mist were very high! (Darabont also directed King's [[ASIN:B000HEWEDU The Green Mile]].)<br /><br />And my high expectations were met in the film adaptation of The Mist...mostly. The story in the movie is very loyal to the book (as I remember anyway...I read it more than 20 years ago!): A monster infested mist descends on a small lakeside town, and we follow the perils of a group of townspeople trapped in a grocery store when the mist hits. On screen, some of the actions and decisions by the terrified captives are a little hard to grasp, and the movie has a truly haunting and affecting ending that was much more depressing than the book's. Otherwise, the story from the book seems completely intact.<br /><br />There's great suspense. Good acting. I was thoroughly entertained. And unlike too many film adaptations of King's Horror stuff...The Mist was very well done and preserved a lot of the prose, shock and character of the original story.<br /><br />Any Horror fan should enjoy The Mist, and any fan of King and the original story shouldn't miss this DVD.D.
B00104W8T6|1.0|This just goes to show you how a movie and mass marketing can sell music. On it's own, this CD would never sell. I predict in 2-3 years, there will be at least 50 of these for sale you can buy for 0.89 cents each. Yours may be one of them.
B00005JPTI|1.0|Don't get me wrong, the movie was pretty good but it totally missed the point of the original story.  If this was an original IP it wouldn't have gotten 1 star.<br /><br />Because Hollywood thinks that American movie-goers are simple, and will settle for the same crappy mix of self-sacrifice and sadness that has been the theme of too many movies (mixed with some cool CG) they decided to completely dumped the original meaning of the title \\"I Am Legend\\"; which I might add, if I think about it in its original context is chilling and genius.  The alternate ending somewhat makes up for what was shown in theaters but, they really screwed up by cutting it just to appeal to more consumers.  That's all this film was, it took a mildly popular and ingenious story and twisted the ideal into something more \\"lowest common denominator\\" for profit.
B000W1V5VU|2.0|Good movie, bad movie, it's the third one, you should know what you're getting.  Anyway, I just want to say that I'm guessing Eddie Izzard originally had a much larger part & it ended up edited out for time to allow for more Clooney/Pitt face.  Too bad because I think they really missed an opportunity to unleash the magic of Izzard.  LOL  He's brilliant & I wish more Americans knew about him & his unbelievably charismatic intelligent humor.  I don't care if he's wearing men's clothing or dressed as executive transvestite, he's hot in a way that Clooney/Pitt are, how do you say, not.  AND bonus, he's not just a pretty face like Pitt (hello, has he ever been good in anything? Comment & let me know), he can actually act.  How about Clooney/Izzard for 14???
B000Y1ZXU2|3.0|As a loyal long-time Tool fan, I was excited to see they had released a new DVD.  The video on the disc was awesome and exciting to watch.  I have always been impressed by the visual stylings the band chooses to accompany their music.  What I was disappointed with, though, was the lack of other material on the disc.  Specifically, I was expecting more videos.  Instead, there was the actual music video and some making-of-type documentary footage.  Very disappointing.  I am not a person who objects to spending money on good quality items, but I must say I was angry with myself for spending $10 for a single video.  How many times am I really going to break out this DVD to watch a single video?  Tool has been known to add hidden footage to their DVDs and CDs, but do not expect to find anything here.  For the die-hard Tool fan out there, I suppose this is a worthy purchase to add to one's collection.  For most people, though, find a die-hard Tool fan and make friends.
B000W1V44I|5.0|The Backstreet Boys seem to have fallen into obscurity in today's pop world, and it's a real shame because they are the definition of pop. They don't need synthetic warping of their voices to create a good song; they sound the same live as they do on their album. They don't cut corners, they're talented, they deliver quality vocals, and they do both ballads and pop beats equally well. Their songs can make me cry and want to dance. They are probably the only band I will end up listening to forever. 15 years is a ridiculously long time for a band, let alone a pop one, and I will forever be impressed at how they've endured. They went on a long hiatus, lost Kevin as a member, had AJ in rehab, Nick's voice seems to change with every album, Nick and Brian went solo, and half of them got married and even had kids. I'm amazed they're still around, much less able to put out such an incredible album. The only reason that they are no longer making waves with their every move is because of the shift of the music industry. They don't rap, sing overly sexually suggestive tracks, ditch their band because they think they're too good for them (ahem, JT), or get their music produced by Timabland (I still can't believe that Apologize was distributed as \\"Timbaland ft. OneRepublic\\"). It's such a shame that they haven't been able to turn off their talent in order to be a big success again, and I mean that in the most sarcastically ironic way I can possibly muster in text.    I have to note that this is an album that requires a little more breaking in. It took a couple of listenings before I really got into it. And then I put the entire album on repeat, because I could do so without having to press \\"skip\\" all the time. Also, what I like best about this album is how non-generic the lyrics are.    Their first two singles, Inconsolable and Helpless When She Smiles are killer songs. Inconsolable has been compared to Incomplete, but I don't think they're really the same. In fact, I think the only reason people say that is because the word \\"Incomplete\\" is so close to \\"Inconsolable.\\" Incomplete sounded like a complete tragedy (albeit a beautiful/powerful one), but Inconsolable stands on a sort of middle ground between happy and sad. I actually think it sounds hopeful. It's vocally demanding (their live performances of this track aren't their best), and really shows off their newly mature sound. It's a solid Backstreet Boy classic.    Helpless When She Smiles, in my opinion, is nothing like any of the ballads they've done before. Well, it may be a little like Incomplete. It's the kind of song you close your eyes to and let the emotion fill you up. The lyrics are smart, particularly the chorus, and it is again very vocally driven, and is simply just an amazing song.    After these two, the best power-ballad is Something That I Already Know. It is heartbreakingly beautiful.    Treat Me Right is refreshingly different from their usual style. It is subtly upbeat and probably the closest they come to the sort of pop that has followed since their glory days. I particularly like the choreography they do with this song on their current tour. The only problem I have with this song is with some of the non-chorus parts towards the end. They don't quite seem to fit together smoothly, but overall, it's a good listen.    Panic is my favorite upbeat song off this album. At first, I thought it was a strange song. I actually have no idea what it is about it that makes me like it so much, but I feel that it's better than Everything But Mine and Any Other Way (which I've heard are going to be their next single(s)). I just find it so much catchier and unconventional.    If you have the chance to get the deluxe copy of Unbreakable, you won't be disappointed. Bonus tracks Downpour and In Pieces are both very good songs.    My last word is that I imagine that it's been difficult working without Kevin. Many say that it didn't make a difference, but only those who don't understandharmonization would say that. There is a reason it's called a barbershop quartet, and not a trio. Harmonies work better with four parts, and when there was five of them, one would sing solo and the other four would harmonize. Now only three of them harmonize. They've had to work hard to adjust their sound and find songs where they can fill out the sound with just 3-4 voices instead of their previous 4-5. It is most noticeable in their live performances. But they are still doing spectacularly. I commend the Backstreet Boys for coming back better, although not bigger, than before. They have rightfully earned their success, and I hope that they will continue reminding us that there is good pop music left in today's culture.

And the characters just kept getting more & more unbelievably morally degraded.  I was shaking my head saying 'why would they....' by the end.  It seemed just pointless & I felt sorry for Casey Affleck.  Anyway, I could have just reviewed it by saying 'Morgan Freeman's acting looked bad in this movie.'  And I just don't think Morgan Freeman ever looks bad.  I don't know, got a long afternoon to kill?  Decide for yourself.

Though rarely heard in Taiwan, Mr. Graham has inspired me in making smart investment in the local stock market. I, for the last two years, have been going over this book and surprisingly find how insightful Graham are in looking at the basic human nature in the market. Attitude, rather than the principles of choosing stocks, is what I think Graham contribute to me in making my own investment. My incestment is growing, no matter how hard the time has been. Fear for the inexplicable stock market is the core of this book and is the most precious part. Ch.8 and Ch20, as Warren Buffett recommended, are those most worthy of reading, and they make me and my portfolio stronger every day, even in bear market. Discussions on mutual fund (CH9) keeps me away from losing money. Principles on how to choose stocks generate real money for me. I am not reading this book to be second Warren, I am reading it to be a rich long-term investor, which I am now feeling more possible than before I read it.

She's good-hearted, going so far as to place an ad in Bowler's Weekly for her grandfather and his buddies.

I found he'd be more believable if he'd just look straight into the camera & say 'Look, I'm a liberal idiot like most successful actors & want to decrease my guilt by standing for just causes & promote a socialist society.  However, I'm a geek in person, just a useless BonoWannabe, so I'll go for roles like this that force feed the socialist agenda & I'll get the role because I have a pinch of acting ability but a handful of eye-candy.'  What was I saying?  What was my point?  Oh I dunno, maybe he's awful...AGAIN...Blanchett's role was too short, the Mexican lady was great, the Japanese vignette was very clever but in whole, the story pushes the point down your throat, no subtlety, no leaving the viewer to think, just telling you what you should think.
1400031087|5.0|I read this book AFTER the dramz went down w/Oprah, and I have to say, it's a really great read.  I feel like I went through every emotion possible.  I don't care that he changed some things.  It's still a good book.  What I want when I see a live show, movie, or read a book is to be taken out of my life and MOVED!  And I was.  It's great.  I bought his Leonard book right after I finished.  And then when I finished the Leonard book (in a day and a half) I went out and pre-ordered his new book.  Poo poo on all you naysayers   who let some alterations of the truth affect your experience of something great.
B000E6UWE4|1.0|I've never stopped reading a book 50 pages in but I couldn't handle the lack of history, lack of character depth and the overall cryptic view of everything.  No explanations behind anyone.  Skipping YEARS in between chapters when it's difficult enough to figure out what's going on.    If you have a desire to read this book, take it out of the library or borrow it from a friend, but do not purchase it.  It'll only encourage Mr. Erikson to write more.

B000MNP2KI|5.0|I'm not a Bond fan; I don't get it.  And I'm married to a Brit so every Christmas season involves some Bond marathon.  And while I think Connery is cool, Brosnan wasn't even that hot in the 80's unless you were into things like pink & gray argyle maybe.  So this Bond's for me.  You know he was sporting some studded leather & wearing black while Brosnan was at prep school.  And personally, I thought the gadgets were stupid.  Hubby says this Bond was made for good old American me.  He's just glad I don't mind watching this one over & over.  If it was indeed made for newbie Bonders like me, I thought it did an excellent job of explaining how to become, why they're so cold, etc.  Yummy.
