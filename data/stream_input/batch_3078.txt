B0006GANOQ|3.0|This is a fairly good action flick, pretty well executed.  Reeves does a decent job.  Bullock is underused.  You really want to see more of her (you can take that two ways, both valid), but you'll have to wait for another movie for that.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I am loving candy crush soo glad I can play it on my KindleFire!!! Good looking out Amazon. Keep up the good work.
B00004UEDQ|3.0|This movie could really look at the problems of beating substance abuse, and really look at Bullock's range of talents.  It short changes the viewer on both counts.  What it does, it does well, but it is trimmed too closely.  The supporting actors are generally very good, but it is clearly a Bullock film.  That is not a bad thing.
B0039Q7QKE|5.0|It is great! I love it and it looks very good. It is a good toy and I will buy related toy further.
B00BWBHIUG|1.0|they didn't show up in the game, I did that about two hours ago!!!! Seriously I'm suppose  to get 80 or so pearls!!!!
B00A8MGIZG|5.0|While I found the book somewhat hard to follow, the producer excellently cues us visually to the major threads of this piece.  It is extremely thoughtfully done and thought-provoking.
B00EKHE1JA|5.0|Awesome figure, but then again Striker Eureka's the most badass Jaeger, the only mark against it is that be careful with the blades, then can come off easily, otherwise badass model.
B005S9EK5Y|5.0|In these dark times, it is good to reflect on the good that compassion can bring and the emptiness that the letter of the law produces.  Casting, acting, and production were all excellent.
B00F0AI9Y4|5.0|You'd expect Avicii to create songs that were only meant for the dance floor. If so, you'll be surprised by this album. It's dance music for sure, but they are legitimate songs with vocals/lyrics that aren't just an after-thought. This album really impressed me. I love it.
0399159347|5.0|Well written and loaded with interesting characters.  Loved the epilogue insights. Very interesting to read what &#34; could have happened&#34; if different choices were made.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Grisham is the master of &#34;can't put it down &#34; story telling! Nice to see Jake's character in the book as well.
B005MMY9A8|5.0|love this movie. love hemsworth and elba. they make the movie I've seen it 5 times and it never gets old
B00D5O7BPU|5.0|I have THE app for 199$ and it is  so  good  You  should have  IT  CAN YOU GET it<br />Tell people about this
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|It can be addictive -- some levels are okay and entertaining - but some like the timed levels are frustrating and do not produce real thought --- other levels that have multiple screens and multiple distractions such as bombs, chocolate, and other barriers in combination -- produce real stress (not fun).
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|love this game! addicted for sure. I love how its sinks with my phone too! so I can candy crush everywhere I go!
B0094BB4TW|3.0|The site does not have enough privacy protection -- I do not want the entire world to know (my personal information or what I share with my friends) -- only my friends ---- plus I do not like the options that protect the sharing and posting functions -- options need to have conditions such as only with my friends or open to all.
1451666179|5.0|Allie's an internet legend, and for good reason. Her stories are exceptionally specific, but resonate deeply with everyone who reads them. I thought about half of the book would be old material from the blog, but was pleasantly surprised that MUCH more than have was stuff I had never seen before (other reviews claiming more than half are pulled off her blog are inaccurate) it's essentially a book of a few of her absolute greatest hits and a treasure trove of new stories that are equally as good, if not better.
B00DZAWPNM|5.0|Between their last CD and this one, I'm in awe! I've always been a fan, but it's nice to see them getting more back to their roots, but just with new spin on it! I always love how clever they are with the lyrics... Fabulous as always!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|FINALLY!!!! I have been waiting for so long for this  to be on the kindle and finally it is here. I love this game. It is so addictive.
B004SIIBGU|4.0|A very nice app, and similar to the usual process experienced on eBay web-site. The main problem is the keyboard size on my Kindle requires more precision than I often can achieve.
B005BZQS1E|3.0|I would only consider this movie if you are bored and have nothing better to do then watch a mildly entertaining movie. If you are a pot head you might like it more then the average person. Otherwise just rent it if you have noting better to do.
B002NN5F7A|3.0|The performances of the cast were outstanding. However, the story was very depressing to watch because of the pressure placed upon the characters in the movie. If a viewer had a bad day at work, watching this movie would not give the person a needed lift.
B00404YUG2|5.0|Saw him on Oprah.<br /><br />Like what he was saying. Great concept. Have share this with many people. The story of resistance and how to over come and why we have it.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway surfers is a great deal because of<br /> the price is free and you can play other people who are your friends
B00C2VIA52|4.0|lots of fun, lots of replayability.  Sometimes hard to get a multiplayer game, but other than that, great.  Best part is it's free and you don't have to purchase anything.  You can earn cards, etc, by playing... it will just take longer.
B005OCHOZS|4.0|Liked it. Interesting perspective on a food plan and understand in different ways to fuel your run.  Nice follow up to born run.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Not a real game player, but once I started Candy Crush I did not want to stop.  Fun and challenging,  I love it!
B008AK8FHM|3.0|I found this book interesting, but I think that if the author had had more time to digest and ponder his amazing experiences, he would have not come off as half cocked.  It is traditional for one, like St. Paul and many others, who had such intense personal revelations to go off into \\"the desert\\" for a few years and let his heart and intellect digest, so to speak, the raw gift he has been given.  I think that Dr. Alexander would have been much more persuasive had it been a bit more \\"scholarly\\" in exploring  the  relationships of the various faith traditions' teachings in this area to his own \\"infused\\" understanding from his NDE.<br /><br />As a Catholic Christian, I had a problem with some of Dr. Alexander's terminology and \\"theology\\", but I am not sure if this was not to some extent do to my misunderstanding of his rather idiosyncratic vocabulary, which, as I wrote above, he may have refined with a greater knowledge and understanding of the related literature.<br /><br />That being said, I wish to applaud Dr. Alexander for his courage in trying to persuade his colleges in the neuroscience field of the existence of mind as related to but ultimately separate from the brain.  The lack of this understanding results, I believe, in the fundamental inability of this field to make, after so many years, any real substantial progress.
B0020BUWX2|5.0|This was a quick read and while sad, it gave and intriguing perspective on the events that occurred.  I would recommend this book.
B00EV6T6DQ|5.0|I thought Blue was one of the best books I've read in years. Pretty recently I saw a trailer for the film version at my local arthouse theater and was intrigued. A week or so later I discovered that it was actually a graphic novel at first and that it was available on my Kindle. The art style depicted on the cover also pulled me in and so I decided to drop the money and buy it.<br /><br />It's been a long time since I felt so moved by a story. Half the time I was reading it (especially during the beginning and the end) I was left in tears. It's amazing to see Clementine's constantly conflicting emotions and mentalities about what is right and what is wrong and the passion of her relationship with Emma...but it's equally painful to see the consequences of such a relationship. The movie hits my local theater next week and I've rarely ever been so excited to go see a movie because the book was simply spectacular.<br /><br />Some minor nitpicks about this version, though: while the story is an instant 5-star in my book, the kindle version deserves probably a 3-star rating...maybe 3.5 to be a little generous. I've read other graphic novels on the Kindle before and never really had issues. However the text style plus the way they frame some of the panels makes it difficult to read at times. Likewise, there's times in it where it jumps around in panel order. Like for example, rather than starting from the first panel to the last, there's one page that opens with the last panel and then goes back to the top. This marred the experience just a tiny bit for me. That said, though, the art itself still shows itself beautifully and the story is still as good as ever.
B002VRZEYM|4.0|The Food Inc is very real, interesting movie about our food and also very popular in  stores corporation what offering us  their products
0307341577|4.0|While this book is, at times, difficult to read--it is equally difficult to put it down. It is well-titled Dark Places, because there are plenty of them. Being thrust into Libby's world, as we are, is a rough ride; and yet, her confusion and need to know are what drove me to keep reading. I needed to understand, just as much as she did (or so it seemed). This story does not take easy paths and it does not present easy answers...while I had my suspicions about some of the 'results', I didn't really get any of them 100% right. Aside from the obvious dark places--those surrounding the murder of Libby's family--we are also encouraged to reflect on the potentially macabre aspects of interest in survivors and prison inmates as celebrities and the potential harm of psychology/psychiatry when not held in hands that are skilful, subtle and objective. An excellent read, but I am drained.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|I LOVE my chromecast. It is lacking one feature with Netflix that I wish were there. When watching shows I have to manually select the next episode on the webpage, instead of just playing the next episode, as it would watching on my computer.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|John Grisham is true to form once again.  Great read, details superb to the reader on the edge and ready for the next chapter.
B001QOGYBI|5.0|My kids and us love this movie. It's simple yet entertaining. We quote lines all the time. Great voices for the characters too
B00F35B8F8|3.0|I found this one a little hard to watch.  Maybe a little to cheesy at moments.  Wait for the free video.
B00ESY77LO|4.0|As if you were reading the book and allowing your imagination run wild! Baz really stays true to his style!!
B00ANYJ3NI|3.0|The video brought with hope for better human relations in general.<br /><br />It failed to discuss why (except for Huxley's distorting evolution ala Darwin) so much distrust and lack of cooperation across groups of human beings.<br /><br />Some ot the evidence of things and people being sensitive to changes in the heart or brain were not well documented even with post presentation credits.<br /><br />The field observations of other mammals cooperating was validating of cooperation in among other mammals not belonging to homosapien.<br /><br />I suggest a revision of the content to be more scientific in content, a Buddhist explanation of clinging to thoughts, emotions and body would have helped explain humans being stuck lower frequency of cooperation and trust, and keep the positive speculation..
B0061TQBRK|1.0|My opinion is pretty much the same as M. Pofahl 's review.<br /><br />I can't believe there are so many positive reviews here, these people should be listening to A7F or other pseudo-rock bands, to put it lightly.<br /><br />People who really understand the old records should be disgusted by this \\"dark adreline\\", it is so superficial, fake, commercial, and poser...<br /><br />Due to this, I lost all of the huge respect I had toward Lacuna Coil and I am very upset because of it, it is another band that lost its soul and dishonoured its own past (like did Alice in Chains and many other great bands).<br /><br />\\"Shallow Band\\", here it is a good title for their next album.<br /><br />It kind of hurts me to talk bad about Lacuna Coil but I have to be honest...
B005GY0Y8S|5.0|Well written. Takes you right into the South of France for a look at the countryside & the peoples of that country.
B004U52VPS|5.0|The game is intended for 5+, but my son is such an Angry Birds fan that I got it for him. He LOVES it! The materials are of good quality and not heavy. The playing cards are a great addition. He obviously does not play for points (game can have up to 4 players), but he looks at the design on each card and has me create the one he liks..with his help. He loves to shoot at the blocks and quickly learned the game.  Very entertaining. I would highly recommend it.  Note: I would always supervise this game though as there are smaller pieces included.
B00CO4GO7I|5.0|Already read it twice! Bought this one & re-read it.  IT BROKE MY HEART. He had so much to give, was enjoying<br />life, his children AND his wife. WHY-O-WHY,DO BAD THINGS HAPPEN TO SUCH WORTHY PEOPLE?

0811870413|5.0|Whether you decide to make natural leavened bread or use stor bought yeast, the tips and techniques from this book are very useful and insightful.  The recipes are great as is or as jumping off points to develop your own takes.  This is my new favorite bread book!
B00ELOOYZI|5.0|A well-made app in the vein of Kerbal Space Program.  The tutorials are well-designed and helpful when you're first getting started.

B007HUD6OS|4.0|Theodore Boone, the young man aspiring to be a lawyer is back, and he’s facing his most dangerous case yet. As Strattenburg sits divided over a hot political and environmental issue, Theo finds himself in the middle of the battle. When he uncovers corruption beneath the surface, Theo will confront bigger risks than ever to himself and those he loves. The Theodore Boone series are always good reads and this one will not disappoint.
B000002LGA|1.0|This album is like all VU and Lou Reed meterial I have ever had the displeasure of hearing....terrible.  Lou Reed cannot write, play or sing. I mean his music, VU included is so bad it's actually amazing to hear in the fact that this garbage actually got recorded and a handful of people praise it for some unknown, oviously talentdeaf reason.  Worst \\"music\\" I have ever heard.  Overrated garbage.
B00DQZQPNM|5.0|It fits perfectly and protects my kindle fire hd all around when closed.  It does fold out to help &#34;stand it&#34; so I can watch videos.

B00D6QUMWG|5.0|Every soprano who ventures into the Verdi repertoire probably takes a look at a list of all the possibilities both in roles ready to perform and others to come.  Then there are comparisons to be made with all the recordings already in the archives.  Any fan of opera has their diva who comes to mind in certain roles.  I'm actually looking forward to the possibility of catching Anna Netrebko on stage in performance as Leonora and the other Verdi leading ladies on this recording.  Brava Anna for taking the step in this direction where you are sure to leave a legacy for all those who adore your work.
B000002LQD|1.0|This album is like all VU and Lou Reed meterial I have ever had the displeasure of hearing....terrible. Lou Reed cannot write, play or sing.

Worst \\"music\\" I have ever heard. Overrated garbage. Music does not get any worse than this....but then again this trash is not music just someone drunken incoherently rambling to annoying noise.
B003Q6D2B4|5.0|If you like action, romance, espionage and a boat load of laughs in the mean time, you'll love this movie. If you don't like Bruce Willis or John Maldovich this movie isn't for you. But if you do, this is right up there with all the other Bruce Wiliis &#34;Die Hard&#34; type movies only better with more laughs.

B005C0DHIK|4.0|I saw excerpts of this documentary years ago on a news program.  Typical story of big corporations coming into small towns and ultimately destroying their water supply with chemicals, etc. and taking no responsibility for it.  All for the sake of the Almighty Dollar.  Fracking is a dangerous procedure and the evidence is clearly shown in this documentary.<br /><br />Well worth taking the time to watch, you'll be stunned by what you see.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Grisham has done what I think is impossible. Each time I read one of his \\"events\\"  I wind up thinking two things ... what a great story a nd how could he possibly surpass what I just finished reading ... and then he goes out and will do exactly that.
B003O86FMW|5.0|After finishing the hunger games I had to immediately buy Catching Fire and the story picked up immediately where HG left off. It is even better than the first book because the danger and drama escalate ten-fold. A must read.
B009ZZDNT6|3.0|I won't have downloaded this app  if it had not been a commercial about a child's  tablet and it said can your kindle do that. Yes my granddaughters kindle is able to do that. I really like this app.  It does what it says. If you upgrade it really is nice.
B00EKTCQCC|5.0|I bought two other apps for anatomy.  They were OK but something is always missing.  Of course they were a couple bucks to $5.  The quality is totally different here.  Pictures are so real and function is much more sophisticated.  You can also arrange the picture how you want and save it.  I personally like to grouping things so I put muscles in group and it's much easier to study that way.  If you are serious about learning anatomy, don't be cheep (like I did with two other apps)and get this one.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|once you start playing this game it is addicting. I play it on the computer, phone and now my kindle.
B0035JRVBO|5.0|Forest redefines &#34;retarded&#34; in the modern world: Showing that most of the &#34;normal&#34; he deals with are really the emotionally disabled amoungst them.  Completely entertaining, compelling and mesmerizing.  How could anyone not love Forest Gump?
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|I had fun playing this game. Currently, I'm at the last level, level 500. When are you going to add more levels? Also, how come I can't play higher levels on my kindle and smartphone? Their levels are only up to 440. In addition, please add more lives. It gets to be boring when I have to wait half hour to play again.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I wanted to post a review since Bared to you, However, it didn't feel right until I finished all three... Well, guess what? There a two more books pending to finish this love story. I know there is a lot of people complaining about this issue. I get it. But, this kind of story couldn't be finished in three books. I knew this by chapter 15 of Entwined. There is no way you can have a happy ending with all the pending issues. I loved the story because I personally identify myself with them. I married a &#34;Gideon&#34;. A little less possesive and without the sexual abuse, but the issues of trust are the same. It's really hard to accept and learn to live with it. The only way the relationship can survive is through true love. Trust is something you have to work really hard to gain and keep. I loved how Ms Day developed all characters. Even though we only hear Eva's &#34;voice&#34;, we are very aware on what all the character are feeling. All of them have a very strong &#34;voice&#34; themselves.<br />In summary, I love the story. I wish I knew when the next installment will be released. Congratulations to Ms. Day on this beautifully told story.
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|This app is so awesome... it shows you how much space it cleaned up which is great! Love it! So easy and user friendly....
098478280X|2.0|This book probably got more voting than required. Not as useful as I had hoped for. Too vague sometimes .
B004HO6I4W|4.0|Was a cute movie, i love the fact it came with blue-ray and regular dvd so I can watch it anywhere!!
B009AMAOTQ|4.0|What a cast! And directed by Jon Turteltaub (\\"National Treasure\\" and \\"While You Were Sleeping\\"). How can we lose? Well....<br /><br />Three old buddies want to throw a bachelor party for their last single pal, so off to Vegas they go! This geriatric PG-13 fling looks at what happens in Vegas and what probably should have stayed there. Too many bikinis, too many gyrating bottoms, too many prostate jokes, too many strobe lights, and too many silicone bosoms, but the strength of a long-time friendship ultimately endures.<br /><br />Look at this outdated Rat Pack and their cohorts:<br />  * Robert De Niro (\\"The Family\\") is Paddy, a guy who is still in mourning for his wife. This pugnacious guy can really hold a grudge...<br />  * Morgan Freeman (\\"Oblivion\\") Archie has packed his pill case and has programmed his cell phone to remind him to take his meds.<br />  * Michael Douglas (\\"Behind the Candelabra\\") is Billy with the fake tan and the fake hair, never married, never really wanted to... ...except that once....<br />  * Kevin Kline (\\"Darling Companion\\") when Sam is given a Get Out of Jail Free card from his wife, opportunities beckon.<br />  * Mary Steenburgen (\\"30 Rock\\") if Diana ever makes it big in show biz, she will be the first to be surprised.<br />  * Romany Malco (lots of TV) Lonnie will always cater the best party for the biggest tipper.<br />  * Jerry Ferrara (\\"Think Like a Man\\") Dean really blew it, so our heroes make him think he has offended the Mob!<br /><br />Eventually this bawdy and profane outing began to wear on me. I'm not a big fan of insult humor or the ogling of young bodies, so despite laughing out loud a few times, I found myself wondering what Dan Fogelman (\\"Crazy, Stupid, Love\\") had in mind when he wrote the script: Comedy? Drama? Social commentary on aging? Hmmm....<br /><br />This is a pleasant way to spend 105 minutes, but you won't remember much about it in a couple of days. Amazon will notify me when the DVD is available so I can let myJayFlix.net people know.

B000TCEU4Q|5.0|This is my first time buying items online and I live way far away from America but suprisingly they delivered it 3 days faster than the estimated time. 5 stars for Amazon.Its very safe too. There are air bags in the box ,so it wont get damaged. The quality is good and cool. It really becomes better flying with a throttle quadrant and it is easy to controll the speed, flaps and spoilers.5 stars for the items too! Oh, and there is some demo flying games which comes with the item too.
B003PIUBZS|5.0|We love this show! The first season and the Gannicus season really touched us because Andy was such a great Spartacus.
B0000047CW|5.0|Bahia is without a doubt the greatest track ever put together by Stan.  Just wonderful.  I listened to Stan and all the other West Coast Jazz greats all through my ‘salad years’ ages ago.  Bahia still stirs my heart every time I play it.
B00BD99JMW|1.0|I was on board for the entire series. I didn't care for the small chapters jumping back and forth, it made a disconnect between the characters for me. The sudden, and I mean sudden, demise of a strong female character ( don't want to say any names) doesn't make her any stronger by her self sacrifice. I happened just about the time you figured out what was going on.<br />Usually I'll reread a book several times, as I have all of the other books in the series. Not this one. I was shocked, disappointed and unsatisfied with the entire book and think it could have gone in a much different direction and could even have been a follow up story. A huge reader who is faithful to characters. Hate seeing Four left out in the cold all over again.<br />Ironically, this is the very first negative review I have ever written.
B00ALCBTWU|2.0|Shame they spent this kind of money to make this movie, and it just goes on and on,,  they go on a mission, and shoot a truck load of ammo that they didn't carry..  Super boring!
B0019LZV4E|3.0|The Actors Johnny Depp and Alan Rickman are both accomplished in their own right whose skills brought out enough intrigue to make this dark drama interesting, however the over kill on vengeance ruined the plot. Too violent and too bloody for this movie to have the legs it would take to merit a higher rating from my point of view, and I never cared for Musical Movies!
B00B9B4IYI|5.0|I got this bluetooth wireless receiver over the overly reviewed Logitech one mainly because it was all digital and supported aptX compression.<br /><br />I paired this with a Nuforce DIA amplifier and some Polk Audio Atrium 4 speakers.  The sound quality is crisp and clean.  The audio range sounds great, no distortion introduced by this unit at all thanks to the good audio quality compression of aptX.  I don't believe that the Logitech one supports aptX.  I think my speakers in general could use a touch more bass (I am used to a 10&#34; subwoofer).<br /><br />I get about 35-40ft of range before I start to see some degradation in the connection.  The range is really great.  When I compare the range to some crappy bluetooth wireless stand-alone speakers it is vastly superior.<br /><br />The only complaint I have about this is that it doesn't try to auto-reconnect if the connection is lost.  Honestly, this really isn't even a complaint, it just takes a second to re-connect via my HTC DNA.<br /><br />If you want a clean digital output with aptX and good range this is your best bet.  I searched the internet for a while.
B0083KUZ86|4.0|i bought this to update my dvd, it was cheap enough to justify it.  so if you find it cheap, then it is worth it, especially if you like high def laughs.  enjoy
B008EEZ64Y|4.0|Have your child read this book and then discuss their thoughts on the book, it's a good book in the sense it should generate some questions or comments from your child.
B0084AXZK0|5.0|Thank you Sir Oscar Wilde.  In this writing you have succeeded in making an old man not regret his aging.
B00FWLDHSY|4.0|Not just for the younger generation. My twenty-something son said it was good and us baby-boomers enjoyed it too! Yeah, it reminded us  a lot of the old Godzilla movies, but it was a new and fresher view. This is like Godzilla's Friends meets the Transformers!
B00ECTZKJ6|5.0|Best band around! Love the new CD and am excited that I get a TShirt with purchase.  Shipping for the shirt is taking a few weeks but I'm sure that has to do with the traffic of the new release.
B00G32QIEG|3.0|While it has good actors and an interesting concept, the plot goes sideways quickly. You start thinking of all the other movies that had a similar scene (Men in Black, Ghostbusters, the Avengers and Ghost). While it does have some new concepts, It ends too predictable. Some laughs, but not as many as you expect.
1416972242|5.0|I really liked this book. I enjoyed the first book so much that I went out and bought this one right away to see what happened next. If you liked the first one, you will defiantly like the sequel.

B008HTQ28K|4.0|As always John Grisham's books do not disappoint.  It kept me wondering till the last pat any thing could happen because of all the twists and turns as the story unfolds. Loved it.
B00EVW013E|5.0|unreal action from begining to end this is one of the best movies of the year they didnt save no expenses totally awesome
B00BIPCXJM|5.0|I have been hooked since Episode 1....can't find enough time in the day to watch another episode....I look forward to the upcoming seasons.
B0020BUWX2|3.0|Well I am at loss for words at the moment. I skimmed a lot of this book. At one point I wanted to give up but I am not a quitter and I wanted to see it through. It wasn't my kind of book but that doesn't mean you won't like it. The writing was good, the characters were developed. I pretty much read the parts with time stamps. I probably won't read the next one.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|this game is great but very addictive. I play it before work on my breaks and before bed.I love it.
0446310786|5.0|This was an outstanding book and special as a young girl told the story.  The book dealt with the racial problems in the south around 1935.  Also there was the sweet relationship between father and daughter and other family members .It brought to light the many classes of people from the professional, to the proud whites, the poor whites and the blacks.  It is a classic and often required reading in American high schools.
030726999X|4.0|I love this series, so it was just natural that I would love this one also!  Larsson is a great author who never fails to deliver.
B00FAPF5U0|2.0|This game is kinda fun with a challenge.  However, if you fail to succeed more than three lives you have to wait 20 - 30 minutes to play again<br />which is absurd!  I can find other games which is fun without locking me out b/c I failed three times in a row.
B005LY4B0A|4.0|This game really makes you think. My kids can play the first few levels but that's it. I really believe it really makes you use your brain. And very addicting. Fun
B004EPZ0H0|5.0|Our book club read this all experienced, similar feelings, arange of emotions, outrage, and at the same time empathy  to the family. It also opened up lots of discussion about resarch and ethics. it is difficult to get your head around the fact that this situation occurred at all. Top marks to the author who really made an impact with the fact that the book was simply written and yet left such a range of intense emotions amongst all in our group.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|This book grabbed hold of me and I could hardly put it down.  I cried and smiled, I was touched so deeply by the main characters
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Fun game, although some levels seem impossible to beat! Getting frustrated with only 3 levels left. Hope to see more levels soon!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Great diversion, frustrating at times but you will beat it!  You will get stalled at some levels but eventually you will complete it.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|This game is awesome their is mini games. Coins and gems to use.and you get to create your own pony wold.
1609611543|5.0|This is a great book that gave the insite and new information that I did not know before what wheat was doing to my health. Its a great read. Uses words that are not over my head and all science related.
B00B4Z5J92|5.0|I could watch this over and over! I just it's such an interesting slice of music history and also a contemporary piece with a one of a kind sound board at the core of it. Add Dave Grohl, Tom Petty, Stevie Nicks, Neil Young and many more and it's something special.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This game is so.much fun and addicting i cannot stop playing it! Awesome app everyone should try it out.  E.
B00AEFXN46|4.0|Robert Towne's screenplay is still one of the best, but the film itself has lost a bit of its bite.  And if you're looking for history, look elsewhere.  This is a very clever mishmash of rumor, fact, and outright fabrication.
B000FBFN0Q|2.0|The writing was clever enough to keep me reading but I tired of being in the main character's head. Her convoluted justifications for buying everything became repetetive and predictable. Her lying made her unlikable. And though she showed flashes of character development, in the end she does not learn anything. Also, I guess I just don't find shopping that interesting.
B000NTPDSW|5.0|Wonderful storytelling and acting.  Still stands up well after all these years-- and all those copycats on the big screen and TV.
B0031RS2XG|4.0|It does not pretend to have a magic formula, it lays out the steps you must take to make your message &#34;sticky&#34;. After reading this book you can return to any single chapter and re read as the chapters are self contained.
0316227706|5.0|What a great photo book to have laying out! The pictures are so fun and make you outright laugh at some of the dogs as they plunge into the pool. A great gift for the dog lover or photographer you may know. Underwater Dogs brightens your day and makes you smile! Looking forward to more pics from Seth and hopefully another fun filled book!
B0091REZMW|3.0|I enjoy playing this game, sometimes you have to wait quite a while for the energy to restore and it can seem quite slow, but if you like hidden object games this one is good.<br />I haven't had to spend any money, as with all these games if you are impatient then yes you could easily spend a lot, but I haven't felt the need so far.
0375415297|5.0|This is, and I am sure it will continue to be, one of the most interesting, well researched and valuable of books written on J.S. Bach and his times to date. I began it the day it arrived and have barely put it down. That is saying a lot as I have been buying and listening to and reading about Bach for the past 50+ years.<br />Just a quarter of the way into its more than 600 pages, I can report that this book should prove to be invaluable to anyone interested in Bach, the Baroque, and the musicians of that era and before. It is Gardiner's clear and compelling writing, the depth of his research, and  his emphasis on Bach's life that is so very compelling. Who was Bach? Why was he that way? And how did his life shape his music? Answering these questions are the objectives of the book. He does it better than anyone I have read. There is much new information discovered only in the last decade or more.<br />I will revise this review when I've finished reading, but I wanted to send a dispatch that in the first four chapters, this is proving to be a wonderful and instructive read. And a last note: the footnotes are terrific.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Ordered it within minutes of launch.<br />Pros: Sleekness<br />USB Powered<br /><br />Cons: Not many apps supported.<br />Update: Netflix and Pandora have joined ChromeCast app<br /><br />Even without apps, love the YouTube screencast functionality. Totally worth $35
B00D0N5CSO|4.0|This is one of 15 of very well written detective procedural books primarily taking place in and around Yorkshire, UK.  Even though the town of Eastvale is fictional, Robinson describes the area well and his writing gives one a taste of an area of England that is certainly different from that of the more well-known south.  Sometimes his stories are incidental to the characters and the texture of the environment he writes about, but the search for the perpetrators of crime keeps one addicted...
B00G32QIEG|4.0|Enjoyable ride!  So many negative reviews, but leave your judgements at the door and just let the action take you!
B0073XSVVW|5.0|This is an in the box look at this kit. Will try to remember to do a build review. The box art is superb. The instruction are typical Revell, well done but a little small for my eyes, with many steps. There are 17 sprues well moulded no flash, all packaged in plastic bags. The decal sheet as two options and the decals are in register, Swastikas for the tail are not included. The clear parts look great also. The kit is rated by Revell as a 'skill level 5' built. Dragon does not rate their kits by level (not Armour anyway) and it does not look as difficult as many of their kits, which can by a nightmare. A good buy for the price I think!<br /><br />Bruce
630587493X|5.0|Bicentennial Man is a poignant and humorous story of a rather special android and his desire to become Human.  Robin Williams is brilliant in his portrayal of the Android a performance untypical of Williams's usual roles.  I found myself laughing and shedding the odd tear throughout this movie, a thoroughly enjoyable experience and one to be recomended
B00FXEL00W|5.0|The story is well written. The writer's descriptions of the characters makes them come alive. The writer captured  the love between the two girls with her words<br /> This book is a great romance novel. The story is funny in parts.I would definitely recommend reading this book.
B0091REZMW|4.0|This game is a really fun game. Sometimes it is really slow when you play, it lags.  I also play it on an I-pad which I think is better.
1451675046|5.0|Absolutely everyone should be required to read this book. This is the perfect resource for parents who want to give their children REAL answers based on facts!!  Anyone who values truth will love this book.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|I like this app. Easy to wake to soft tone and easy yo use. It would be great to set auto for 1 week.
B0067RQYNW|5.0|I was looking for a good office app like dropbox for my kindle and after a long time of looking I found this app! It is a great app and I use it all the time to make notes or fun presentations! The only thing I have a problem with is that you have to use Google cloud print for printing and I do not have a Google account. Other than that I would recommend this app to everyone who needs an office app on their kindle or Android!
1433215640|5.0|Loved this classic horror---and it really is HORROR! It was very nerve-racking. I wasn't expecting to pity the monster and hate the doctor as much as I did. Very interesting! :)
1401311083|5.0|Great book! It was a very easy read. It was also a nice follow-up to Heat Rises. Looking forward to reading the rest of the series.
1449305172|4.0|This book is really a lean read. It does have a collection of blog posts combined into one and also a bunch of quotes from Eric Ries, Paul Graham et. al. This book is deep but concise advice in making the best decisions for your startup and approaches to testing and validation that are important for a startup.<br /><br />This book is not only for startup founders, I found it to be helpful in managing technical side (even though it is explained using high-level concepts). I found that this book can also serve as a reference book during your journey. The best part is that the major points in the book are highlighted/emphasized so you do not even need save the best parts.<br /><br />Overall a very well thought-of book.<br /><br />(Disclaimer: This was my first book in any startup/agile/entrepreneur series of books.
B00AZMFK3K|5.0|The casting on this film is fantastic...I can't wait to see where this story goes the fact that Mr. Spock has a love interest and all  makes me so happy. I think Gene would be thrilled how his baby lives on!
B003LZ5B7S|5.0|I have been watching Dr Who now for over a year, and finally caught up before &#34;The Day of the Doctor,&#34; and have absolutely fallen in love with this show, the Doctor, the Tardis, the adventures they go on, the fact that it is completely clean and fun and makes you think. I would recommend this show to anyone who has any sense! :)
B009KS4XRO|4.0|i love this game and try to play it daily but i dont think there are enough bingos for the players and sometimes i hit bingo not meaning to and then i lose that card.... maybe it should ask if you are sure then if some one says yes tell them its a bad bingo.
B00FWLDHSY|4.0|I thought it would be all action and no content. I was wrong. Pretty good story idea - still lots of action. If you have a big TV, watch it there :)
B008XG1X18|3.0|I WANT to love this app. I really do. I think Pinterest is awesome!! But this app....blehh. I can't love it. It's glitchy and slow and just plain annoying. Since the previous update, I can no longer see the botttom 1/5 of a pin when it expands. I keep getting messages saying &quot;Pinterest has stopped working unexpectedly&quot;, which are SUPER annoying because I have to restart my Kindle every single time to get it working again! My feed keeps freezing and then restarting all the way at the very beginning, which is very aggravating because I lose my spot. And every time I try to repin something, it ain't let me pin to my last 8 or 9 boards unless I scroll veeerrryyy slowly! Please fix these glitches ASAP. I love Pinterest and I want to give this 5 stars, but I can't. If these aren't fixed, I may be removing this from my Kindle.
B00ESY7QXI|1.0|Too much everything.  I guess that is kind of the point, but it just was poorly done.  I loved this book and I even liked the Redford version, but this was just too distracted.  I normally love Baz Luhrman - but I could not get into this at all.  Too much stuff - over the top garbage.  I couldn't even finish I was so bored after 1 hour - yuck!
0307592731|5.0|One of my favorite books! Some people may be turned off by the small amount of drug use in the beginning of the book, but the journey is well worth the read!
B005NFVZTM|4.0|The beginnings.  I love the backstory on the characters we have known for a few movies now.  And the scene with Wolverine was perfect!
B001HBYHFA|5.0|I was a big fan of the series.....so I guess it would be expected for me to love the movie. Really good acting from everyone in the cast.
B00EQF0JJC|5.0|This was a fun movie to watch in modern time.  I always love Joss Whedon's stuff and this did not disappoint.
B00BD99JMW|2.0|I was really excited about this book and pre-ordered it as soon as I finished Insurgent. But really I was just disappointed in the ending. There was so much chance do do something amazing with this series and it just fizzled out. What happened??<br /><br />The first two books were amazing, and this just didn't live up to my expectations... :/
B00F91H15W|2.0|Whiny teenagers thinking they deserve celebrities stuff.  Movie summed up in 7 words.  The poor guy in it was delusional, so that made it somewhat interesting.
B00C1BHQXK|4.0|I'm a student of Gary Keller, and this is Gary's time management gift to Real Estate Agents.<br />After reading his &#34;Shift&#34; and &#34;Millionaire Real Estate Agent&#34; this book brings everything together.<br />This is a well researched book, on Time Management principles and practices, and it's not just for Real estate agents.<br />Anybody who wants to focus more on their main life's goal (The ONE Thing) should buy this book.
B004J4WKTW|5.0|I can see this book as a movie. It really gave good visual effects for my mind. I just wanted  it to continue. The magical wager, romance and intrigue was great.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|The ending was not what I thought I wanted out of this series or how I expected it would end.  However, I do think now that this was the best ending for all of the characters involved.  I could not believe how ingrained these characters had become in my life and how much I cared for each of them.  Veronica Roth is a fantastic writer and this has become one of my favorite series.  I am so sad now that it's over though, which says a lot about how great these books were.<br />The Allegiant was engaging and well written, just like the 1st two books in this series.  The character's continued to develop.  The descriptions of Chicago and O'Hare were right on... and could picture every inch of it.
B006S053K8|1.0|This movie starts slow and never picks up. Really, it's just a guy working at an amusement park dating a girl and they have a complicated relationship. No drama or mystery about what's going on. On the other hand, if you're a fan of 80s alternative, the music is awesome. The Cure, Replacements, and INXS just to name a few. Much like Empire Records, great music, sucky movie.
B00A285OOW|5.0|Love it!  Think this might be one of my favorite Philippa Gregory books yet!  Not many people have written about this character directly (she always seems to be a secondary character).  I thought it was a wonderful perspective.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|The installation instructions were a little confusing, and it took more effort to get it working than it should.  Just be aware that the Google Chrome extension is a critical component that must be on your computer or tablet. Once it was installed with the necessary software, we are able to download Netflix movies and TV shows on an iPad and watch them on our big screen TV.  Very happy with the product and the price is reasonable.
B004EC5IUW|5.0|If you are a fan of the Evangelion series, mecha anime, or just animation in general, I would highly reccomend this film. The characters are compelling and real and the animation is absolutely gorgeous. I would say getting the blu-ray would be a good idea- its not too much more expensive than the DVD, and it just makes the lovely animation all the more beautiful.<br /><br />The audio commentary was interesting, as was the glimpse into the process of making the films.<br /><br />...I don't really know what else to say here. Ooga booga.
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|I like a game to be challenging but when you can't pass a level after playing for 3 days ------its not fun any more.
B0030ZOYHC|5.0|This movie is the first in a series of four (though only 2 have been released in English, and the third should be coming out sometime in 2014), and is a beautiful piece of animation. I would reccomend it to fans of Evangelion, mecha anime, or animation in general. The blu-ray clarity is awesome and makes every detail visible.<br /><br />I was a bit bummed that the film didn't have an audio commentary, however, the other features and the film itself more than  make up for it.<br /><br />Check out the second film, Evangelion 2.22, as well!<br /><br />And don't forget to clean your ears!
B00735HGQ6|4.0|The book immediately pulled me in, never letting go throughout this most unlikely tale that. As it drew to it's denouement, the author socked me with a couple of hard punches which, despite the harshness of the facts carried with it such human beauty and compassion. I loved this book!
1781162646|1.0|I really did enjoy the story and the unique vocabulary which created a small, cozy world for this novel, but it, and the readers, did not deserve such a shabby ending, contrived, unbelievable and just plain awful.  Readers deserve better.
B001DJLCRC|5.0|This is the only one I've been able to watch<br />Can you let me know when the sixth season comes out?
1594744769|5.0|I actually purchased this as an ebook, and enjoyed it quite a bit.  The added photographs really helped put the story together.  Picked up a hardback to loan out.  Arrived quickly and in fine condition.  Looking forward tot he's equal in January,
1936608898|5.0|This book has changed my eating habits without me feeling like I've given everything good up!  Plenty of great ideas to impliment and lots of support too.
B00FEN000S|1.0|i heard fairly good things about this movie so i gave it a try. as an action movie, maybe it could pass as a movie you could watch without thinking. but i expected more. this is nothing more than a bad cartoon show made into a bad movie.
B0040I09RM|5.0|great stars and interesting show love Jackson. not tara. love gemma so real .jimmy smits is great. alwaysuprised on ever show
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|I probably wouldn't have tried this game if I wasn't sick in bed. Wandering through the apps store, I found this and thought I'd try it. I like it. A lot. I only gave it four stars because I am only on level 29, but if it stays this good, I may be thinking five. Finally, a game that lives up to the hype.
B009LDD1X0|5.0|This series continues to be very funny and entertaining, but now has more true emotional content--in a good way! Highly recommended!!
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|A bittersweet story about love, life and death. One of the best books I have read. Augustus and Hazel will steal your heart and leave you thinking of them for days...months!
B00AGOGOLE|5.0|The pictures are amazing,it changed my life from a negative to positive.it takes me less time to have fun cause am taking cool picks
B003L77GH4|5.0|I am a sci-fi buff and luv it all... this series is great & I cannot wait til I complete the series...
B00C1B28Y2|5.0|The images don't do justice to the real thing, the level of detail is amazing and since i bought it i can't stop buying action figures
B00FEJIVRQ|5.0|Best Iron Man yet. Tony Stark's character is growing. Enjoyed watching it. Twice already. Putting it on my Kendel was a great idea. Take it anywhere.
B00BMGUIJE|5.0|The bandai tamashi action figures are awesome, i started with the dbz goku ss2 figure and i can't stop buying them( i need help^__^)
B00AO2P3GA|5.0|Best fps game avaliable at android.. test it ... nice graphics as well.. i hope they add more maps in multiplayer soon
B009AMANH4|5.0|Fascinating look at the personalities, issues, and political maneuvering at the time. Great performances by Daniel Day-Lewis and the supporting cast, especially Tommy Lee Jones.
B00A6CCF0K|4.0|I enjoyed this book, but not as much as I expected seeing as how it's the sequel to &#34;The Shinning&#34;.  It wasn't scary.  More of a thriller, I'd say.  There were a few twists, but overall pretty straight forward.  It kept my attention, but it is not the creepy book &#34;The Shinning&#34; is.  A little slower than I expected it to be. I would still recommend it, but don't expect to be reading &#34;The Shinning&#34;, because that's not what you're going to get.
0316204366|5.0|Really good read<br />Recommend it to anyone who likes stuff from this author . Definitely a 5 star book . Enjoy
B0083Z6AH6|4.0|I’ve long been a Jane Austen fan and this is my favorites. The slow rekindling of Anna and Wentworth’s love is beautifully told and you can’t help by be drawn in. It starts out a bit slow, but picks up as you get deeper into the story.
B00D2CYU2W|5.0|Loved it except all of the gay love making was a little too much. Other than that I LOVED IT!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This is an awesome game. I have not yet gotten the hang of it but I know I will. I loved the movie, and I have fallen in love with those little yellow men; and guess what, I am 52 years old. HA HA.
1476734941|5.0|This is the first diet that I feel that I could stay on for the rest of my life. It is so reasonable and healthy. I am buying it for all the people that I love.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|This book concerns a topic that leads to excellent discussions - &#34;The Right to Die&#34;. The characters are very well developed. The main character's life is profoundly changed for the better by the man that she is aiding.
B009C7ZQM4|4.0|Some features do not work on my large Kindle Fire, but the ones that do are great for improving the Fire's performance. It's a good app to have.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|I was blown away by this season of AHS.<br /><br />I previously watched the entire 1st season on Netflix - it was good, but I wasn't overwhelmed.  I decided to purchase &#34;Asylum&#34; because I had seen some of the episodes on TV and was enthralled. What a great decision!<br /><br />This season wasn't perfect - it got a little too bizarre at points.  I could have done without the the things living in the woods around the asylum, and the aliens (I'm not giving anything away that you wouldn't find in the first episode) - but overall the horror was incredible and the ending was one of the best I've seen for a TV season finale.  I really cared about the characters by the end.  Great job AHS!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Watched my daughter play on her tablet, couldn't wait for it to be available on Kindle! Loads of fun, and very addictive...
B004TN7QPG|5.0|I looked at a number of different readers before settling on Moon Reader+. I started out with Kindle, which is a great reader but does not read . Epub, only Pdf and Mobi, plus amazon proprietary format. I looked at Alkido but it does not read Mobi. Most books and documents are available in one of three formats; Mobi, Epub or PDF. Moon Reader+ is the only one that lets me conglomerate all my documents (including comic formats cbr and cbz).  I have had no problems with the reader and it has become my go to document reader. I keep my Kindle reader around since I have not figured out how to export my kindle purchases to Moon Reader and it is not really a high priority. I do not believe that Moon Reader supports books purchased under ibooks and these are locked into apple proprietary format, which means those purchases are only readable on an apple device while Kindle, Moon Reader and others are usable on apple and android (windows tabs???).<br /><br />What I would really like to see is the ability to categorize books and documents so that they are easier to find and maintain when on a tablet. I hope this is in the next update. When this comes I will upgrade my review from 4 stars to 5.  Other reviewers have detailed many of the other features of Moon Reader and they are correct in that this is a very full featured reader.<br /><br />Great product and I recommend upgrading from the free to the paid version.<br /><br />Addendum: I found that under favorites, I can categorize my books so I can easily segregate books into folders or categories to make them easy to find. You have to dig a little to find it, its not intuitive immediately that you can do this, but it is there and therefore I am upgrading my review to 5 stars. This app just got better and is my go-to reader.
B003G4W49C|5.0|Genius.  Ender's Game proves and explains why it takes genius to recognize genius.  Then the story takes you on a psychological ride you can't get out of your head.  I read this book years ago.  I enjoyed it even more now.  Spectacular.
B0091REZMW|5.0|This is a fun game. I did play this game years ago and lost track. I hope others enjoy it as much as I do.
1451648537|4.0|Walter Isaacson's authorized biography &#34;Steve Jobs&#34; is superb. A couple of the highlights:<br /><br />- The book is huge and includes many small, mundane details. If you want to know everything about a person though, you need this.<br />- And Steve cried.<br />- Books that follow successful people in history should make you want to be a better contributor to society. This book does this.<br />- And Steve cried.<br />- If you are an Apple fanboy or fangirl, or just a casual Apple observer, it is worth a read. If not a buy, borrow a copy from your local library. Or borrow it through the Kindle Libr..... maybe not.<br />- And Steve cried.<br /><br />Rating: 4 out of 5<br />Recommended: Maybe not a repeat read, but yes.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|Loved these books! I am a sucker for a happy ending, so I was a little disappointed that Tris was gone. Would have like to see what would have happened with her and Four in the new city and her place as maybe a leader! Would recommend these books to anyone and everyone no matter what your age!
B00G32VYDG|5.0|In the same vein as men in black but set in the spiritual world,not for deep thinking but just for some thing to escape with for awhile, Jeff bridges as a old west lawman was perfect.
B000XUBFE2|3.0|Took a very long time to grab me and it was a little strange at first adjusting to the narrative
B002U3CCF6|5.0|Great story line, writing was a bit meh but I got over that. She seems to be able to grab your attention from the beginning and all the way till the end.
B00FAPF5U0|1.0|This game is fun, but I have been stuck on level 23 for over a week. I do not want to by anything, if I did I would by an app that was amazing. I hate when they have free apps but then you have to buy crape just to play the game. seriously thinking about deleting it. very disappointing.
B005LY4B0A|4.0|I think this app is good fun and it makes you think I like playing it but I don't like the hour wait for hint. And hints not a hint it's the answer. Maybe it should be one hint to a move then you  can chose more help as you go.
1400052181|5.0|I really have nothing else to add that has not been said already. You won't regret buying this. It is very engrossing.interesting.
B00BWC1UZE|5.0|Great CD.  I was not a real Justin Fan after this album I would defiantly recommend this . I say go out a purchase this cd.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this app it really gives you the feeling that you are looking after your own horse.I recommend this app any day.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|well-written - interesting story - with some interesting plot shifts.  Would definitely recommend - combination of mystery as well as romance.
B00EY8BRGU|1.0|never was able to watch it. the amazon acct timed out a few times during the movie which didnt allow me to see it on time.. and for $5 i expected more
B005S9EJ14|5.0|One of the most heart-warming, sweet movies that deals with many aspects of cultural differences and acceptance.  My whole family went to this movie together and loved it.
B003LQ3YXU|5.0|Absolutely love Doctor Who! It is a great show and I was thrilled when I saw that it was on Amazon Prime.
B006ID6NDQ|5.0|I read this book in one night because it was so gripping. There's not much I can say that the other reviewers haven't already said. If you like adventure, romance, suspense, or history, then you will absolutely love this book. You learn about the personal lives of real Germans, Jews, and Russian's alike during the war and how each of these groups had to adapt to survive. I will never forget this story as long as I live.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|Enjoyed the easy going look into &#34;Australian living&#34;, and the intrigue brought on<br />by so many family secrets.  Thought provoking.  Great book club read.
B005QYKD4I|3.0|Much like the others in the transformers franchise this one develops radically from nothing and leaves a lot to be desired.  The typical hottie and overtly glammed up explosions are here, but again, left me wanting.  If your just going to see a Victoria secret model run around and car parts flying everywhere, you will be mildly entertained
B00FI7XBIS|5.0|Cute game.  Fun way to kill time. No problems or glitches .  Enjoying it very much.  Overall yes I would recommend . Got on free app day and am happy with the download. A fun game for the Halloween season.  No money spent just start over if you run out of ammo.
B00F87ZUYG|5.0|This season starts off with a very good episode. I doubt this season will be bad. I just wish the entire season was out so I could watch it all back to back marathon style.
B00F8H0LM2|5.0|This Ap was downloaded by my 10 year old son. He appears to highly enjoy playing this game whenever he has the chance to do so. I think that he highly recommends it.
B004SD5GZ4|4.0|Great for reading email attachments.  I've always found .pdf an easy way to send and receive attachments.  Looking forward to doing the same with my Kindle Fire HDX.
B005K17RU0|5.0|AccuWeather is a wonderful tool in figuring out the weather conditions. It provides a lot of information and can be configured to prove a prognosis of future weather as well. I highly recommend this Ap.
0307740919|2.0|The book started promisingly enough; lovely language, interesting era. I thought it was going to be a story of the Jim Crow South (during which time it was set), and the shabby treatment of black soldiers upon their return from home. Instead, it was a kind of rambling, almost plotless look at PTSD, alcohol, and tangentially, a weird and almost unexplained tiny subplot about eugenics. When I got to the end, I literally thought, &#34;WTF? This is it?&#34; It was as if she got tired of writing and just stopped. The book had very little character development. Despite Frank's first-person comments, he never really came alive for me, nor did his sister, Cee. The other characters were just too tangential.<br /><br />I agree with other reviewers that if this were a first-time author and not the renowned Morrison, few people would give this book a second glance.
B00499QUK2|5.0|Wonderful series and so glad to be able to watch it here , cant wait for the next one.<br /><br />will watch the whole series
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|This show is fantastic!!!! I can't wait until season 4. My husband and I both watch this show religiously! Awesome
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I cannot put CCS down! Even my 79 year old mom loves it. I count the minutes until my next lives!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|The game got me hooked!  Working on the upper levels gets harder and harder but trying to get there without much help is the challange for me.  Waiting for the next must have game.
B008MWBY6W|4.0|First and most importantly, it's in expensive.  3 very shallow pockets allow for storage of a couple of memory cards, filters, cleaning cloths, etc.  It is not a very large bag, big enough for a mid-size DSLR and a medium-length telephoto zoom lens, e.g. the kit lenses that are often sold with the camera.  You won't be able to put much else in this pack, and there definitely isn't space for spare lenses.  I often have to hide the camera strap underneath the camera so that it doesn't get in the way of closing the bag.  It is good for packing light.  It is inherently unstable when slung over the shoulder as designed and often I feel it would be more useful to have it secured around the waist.  A belt-hook or loop would have been a handy addition to the design.
B002VRNR1Y|5.0|It's always hard to lasso the entire depth and essence of a story from a book and transfer e-v-e-r-y-t-h-i-n-g onto the screen, yet Kubrick manages to capture the bone chilling horror of King's story and pierce the audience with this icy and utterly disturbing film.<br />Stripped down to bare bones this movie is packed with:<br />1. Classic crazy Nicholson in all of his psychotic glory. No one, and I mean no one does it better.<br />2. A perfectly cast Shelly Duvall as the mousey, abused wife who would aid anyone's spiral further down into the abyss of insanity.<br />3. Some pretty chilling acting from a terrific little 6-year old (Danny Lloyd); who, by the way, was unaware that the movie Kubrick was shooting was a horror flick.<br />4. Scenes of disturbing images that pulsate throughout the film, and manage to stay with you long after the movie is over.<br />5. One hell of a great haunted hotel story.<br />Whether you read the book or not, this movie will not fail in thrilling and chilling you to leave one or two lights on, check in the closets, peak behind the shower curtain and maybe, just maybe, have a very restless night's sleep. Ever since the first time of seeing this movie, I still don't see long stretches of hallway (especially in hotels) the same.
B001ANSS5K|5.0|Beautifully written and compelling.  If you are a fan of John Green at all, you will love this one.  I love that his books are ones that both my teen daughter and I enjoy reading, and then can discuss.
B007SYWFRM|3.0|This game is a lot of fun but full of bugs. As soon as one thing is fixed something else breaks. Gameloft is aware of all the errors but doesn't seem to feel the need to fix them. Very frustrating.
B006LAO92I|4.0|Unlike,&#34; Outbreak&#34;, this film is much more realistic, and disturbing. Good job by cast and writers. Sorry guys no Zombies here.
B002Z7FWBI|5.0|I grew up watching Clint Eastwood and the Dirty Harry series and rewatching these movies takes me back.  So glad I added this box-set to my DVD library. So worth it/
B00BD99JMW|2.0|I don´t want to give away that much; but im very sad because I wasn´t so excited for a book since my harry potter days, IM HEARTBROKEN!! I don't know how to explain it any better.... I guess the ending does not make any sense ; i mean there were other ways to show the spirit of Tris.<br />I agree that it wasn´t as captivating as the first 2 books... I had very high expectations .. and Im sad and disappointed.. im sorry but this wasn´t the ending i hoped for...
B00F87ZUYG|5.0|Love the show, smooth streaming, can't wait for the next episode! Great job amazon, the app for amc won't let you stream new ones unless you have cable or satellite.
B00C5R7F8G|4.0|This book is a chilling reminder of previous times when our youth were traumatized by constant reference to nuclear war or nuclear accidents.  Hell, I was a  so-called Cold Warrior and the truth of a lot of this stuff never got to us in our  services.  There was too much rationalization on the effects  such that 'a limited nuclear exchange could be tolerable.'  This is, of course, undiluted BS. In 1957 I witnessed a demonstration of one of the air-to-air weapons (probably a Falcon Missile warhead) in a aerial burst probably at about 20,000 feet.  It was just a little one, perhaps 1 kiloton  but it scared the hell out of me, I'll tell you!<br /><br />If we can't put the genie back in the bottle then we need far better control mechanisms.  I note on Google Earth there very healthy looking Typhoon class missile  subs in the Polyarnyy and Murmansk areas of Russia, just as there are healthy looking specimens of US boomers (Trident) near Bangor Washington.  A pox on all their houses!
B00005N6KG|5.0|Sony no longer makes these headphones.<br /><br />This is the reason for the price hike with online stores and not by Sony.<br /><br />I wanted comfortable headphones that work great without being bulky.<br />I did not want ear buds that fall out and block out all the sounds at work.  I do not like any other similar models.<br /><br />Never would I use these for jogging or other activities.  A new found respect to take care of $50 headphones vs. $10.  I've checked everywhere and they are all over $40.<br /><br />You better get one now before it's all gone and take very good care of them.
B0089LOG02|5.0|I never knew anything about the Orphan Trains.  I suppose those who organized this program meant well but some of the consequences were tragic.  This story was well written and held my attention throughout.  I recommend this book.
1408803011|5.0|Can't wait to see the movie/movies. This book is a great teaser for more things to come from J.K. Rowling and Warner Brothers!
B00FY9JJYA|5.0|I happen to run across u..\\"ROBERT GLASPER BLACK RADIO 2\\" best seller. \\"WHO IS THIS!\\". Click on it, I see artist like Common, Jill Scott, Brandy, Dwele, Masha and the list goes.. \\"WOW\\". Played the snips...\\"OK, I MUST HAVE THIS\\". I love  this album had to download the first black radio. What a great album!
0762451319|5.0|This is a cute little set for any Mortal Instrument fan - neat items , necklace is nice looking not cheap looking and its just worth the price. Tattoos a lot of fun . Must have for a ShadowHunter and came really fast.
B0089LOG02|4.0|The characters are intertwined while they face similar challenges during different time periods, which makes this an interesting and heartwarming book.
0307743659|4.0|Okay, I know that title doesn't make sense so let's move along, shall we? I read The Shining for the first time just a few weeks ago (October, 2013). I've read King's books on and off for nearly fifteen years, but I never had the urge to read this one because I have seen the movie so many times. I don't always enjoy reading a book after I've seen the movie because sometimes I can't get the film imagery out of my head and let my imagination take over. I didn't have this problem with The Shining. The book is so different from the movie that it only took a few pages to kick Jack Nicholson's ugly mug right out the back door.<br /><br />As you can see, I gave it four stars. Why not five you ask? Well, in my opinion, after a while Stephen King is Stephen King is Stephen King. He's a great writer, no doubt about that. However, the styles he uses to make his books tend to meld together into one style. In other words, you can usually always tell when you've plunged into a King novel. Not that there's anything terribly wrong with that, but for me it can become boring. Maybe that's not a good enough explanation as to why I chose four stars instead of five. If I had to pick one reason for any kind of disappointment with The Shining, it would be lack of fright, scares, and chills. I was surprised it wasn't more chilling and scary, especially since it's touted at the top of many best-of lists as being one of the scariest novels ever written. I disagree. Good book. Only a few scares. It's Stephen King. What more is there to say?
B002QNTNL6|5.0|I enjoyed this one.  In fact, I've seen it several times since its release.  I love Amanda Bynes and Kelly Preston. Great way to spend a couple of hours even though the plot is entirely predictable.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|I couldn't put this book down. From the first page to the last page the story line kept me on the edge of my seat. If I didn't know the ending I would read it again!
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|I play Candy Crush Saga on my Laptop at home and now I can take it with me when we go out to places where we have to wait for a while.  It is entertaining and actually frustrating at times.  Addictive.
B00AE9UYJ4|5.0|great game tiles and textures and the best part it is free when I downloaded it makes me happy about time we can get free thing don't u agree
B003O86FMW|5.0|The second book of the hunger games trilogy is the best so far, I have read the 1st book and I loved it catching fire, does not disappoint.<br /><br />My favorite part is the very last sentence when Gale says to Catniss, \\"but Catniss, there is no district 12 attorney for my kindle and missing from this game ever since he liked her so so I was at least two years later on the account of a dollar and missing my sister and today is it that way of all emoticons though the rings and your friends but I have to go to the mall in anchorage and your friends but I have to go to the up girlfriend is the mall and your friend wanted a really long story short of a dollar bill to go back in the up girlfriend and your friend wanted a boss I think if you doing boo to be Mackenzie the up beautiful name for my sister was busy to be b couch potato and missing from the up beautiful day I couldn't find any time I was at least a few weeks of clans kindle books free kindle is the up and your friend printable version from a really bad thing to do you have the rings online and today we are you a boss and your friend of all emoticons though I'm not a boss that's why I was busy to go through this site are totally agree to be Mackenzie the mall and missing from a good p to the next and today is the best game is a boss and the rings and a good boy was like YES it will never forget to be a boss I was just asking it's not a really bad thing that I have to go to the mall in anchorage and your friends.<br /><br />In conclusion, the second book of the hunger games is a great book for ages 12-112.<br /><br />-Ben
B00FN811SY|5.0|awesome the best and accurate bible educational material available<br />anywhere easy to use and so good for children of all ages for parents to use

B0025VLELQ|5.0|Fast shipping..love this movie great family movie, grab the kids and and some pop corn, settle in on a Saturday night
0307270807|5.0|I am reading this book for the second time.  Mr. Herr writes not so much about the physical battles during his time but more about the mental and emotional battles the soldiers, reporters, and others endured.  He gets inside the head of those around him.  This gives the reader a better understanding of the terror.  He delves into the insanity and at times the funny moments.  The people he came to know during his time in Vietnam.  Some of those friends did not come home.
B005R32L66|5.0|we use it every day, sound good, connect good, picture good and recommend to use and downloat it , love it
B00A6CCF0K|3.0|King understands the dilemma he is in with this book.  He actually explains it quite well after the novel ends, so I give him a pass on the whole Shining sequel thing.  Personally, it worked better for me if I left The Shining locked safely away in a box in my head and just moved onto to this other story.<br /><br />So here are my three stars for the strengths and weaknesses of Doctor Sleep.  The book is entertaining and has it's moments but for me, there were too many little things that just plain annoyed me or ruined the mood.  I had a problem getting beyond the goofy names of the members of the True Knot and Rose's cockeyed top hat drove me insane.  I just did not feel a lot of fear from folks named \\"Barry the Chink\\"  and \\"the Crow\\" and a super villain who ran around, for no apparent reason, wearing a jaunty top hat ALL THE TIME.  Also what was the deal with the True Knot?  Where did they come from?  What the heck.  Is there a European road company or ***SPOILER*** are they now extinct?  Makes you wonder how they survived as long as they did.<br /><br />I also felt at times like this was Dan Torrence meets Carrie - not necessarily a bad thing, but just not necessary.  I don't know.  I liked it.  It was good, just not really good.  I do think the really high rating here is because people were desperate for and desperate to like a Shining sequel.<br /><br />It has some thematic similarities to N0S4A2 by his son.  I liked that book much better.  At least it's no Son of Rosemary!
B004EBZX6W|5.0|give you a good signal range and work fine for my little droid stick and we have no problem with it
B004LROUW2|5.0|One of the best fiction book I ever read. I would compare this book with 100 years of solitude. 1000 pages and still we don't feel bored or overwhelmed. The love between the two protagonist is beautiful and carries the book. This is a must to any adult.
B00G2SIW7M|5.0|Incredible album, if you don't like it your not listening close enough. forget what you 'like', and open your ears.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Love it...but addicting Its fun and non violent I let my grandbabies play it Hate the chocolates and time bombs tho.
B001I45UFC|5.0|I bought the book for my twelve year old son but I love it. Great  read. My son loves it too.
B00ELOOYZI|5.0|What seems like a simple game turns into endless hours trying to get the perfect rocket and exploring the smolar system. The controls take some getting used to, but they work very well once you understand how everything works and the best ways to use fast forward / warp mode. The training exercises seem lame at first but you will find yourself going back to them for the little nuggets of information they provide. The sandbox mode means you will never run out of things to do. Want to land on the moon? Go ahead. Want to send a rover to Mars? Make it happen. Your imagination is the limit.
B0083ZBW2Y|5.0|This book brought on all my childhood memories of Call Of The Wild as I`d remembered it. Thank you for the stroll down memory lane! Great book!
B00FAPF5U0|1.0|1 player game. Pretty on screen but,the only instruction doesn't explain how to play the game except get 3 in a row. At the fourth level this &#34;free&#34; game requires payment (no doubt the first of many to come) to continue playing, right now too, or you &#34;lose&#34;. You maybe OK with that but the whole experience for me was disappointing. This is one of those games designed, or engineered, to be addictive and to suck money from the player, with &#34;rewards&#34; but no real end except your credit card limit.
B007WFTFG6|5.0|This is a cute little app for toddlers. it is very easy for them to use. all you need is your finger and a kindle. they just color by dragging their finger around the screen.
0765325950|5.0|I wasn't sure how the author change would affect the story, but I have to say that I absolutely loved the writing in the last 3 books of this series. I read through these books faster than some of the other books in this series, and had a hard time putting it down. Would definitely recommend!
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|I love this game. it is so addicting and easy too play.just use your finger and drag it on the screen to move the characters. It is also a very addicting game to play.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Exciting and fast paced (for a King book) with truly scary and memorable characters. I did not want this book to end!
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|I like to play this game but it can be a bit confusing at first not only that but you have to be very careful as it will ask you to buy things in the game that you will actually have to pay for. it is also very different from the original oregon trail game as you are settling a tow instead of finding a town. I would not recomend this to kids just because of the fact that you are able to purchase things using this game. albeit you need a password to your account to do it.
0307352153|5.0|Bought this book for my son's school project.  He loved the book.  Gave him insight on the world of introversion.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This game is like tetris on steroids! Very fun,  very addictive! When you run out of lives you are tempted to buy more but don't give in!
B001F290E4|5.0|Loved it!  Had a copy and played it while having a party and a friend loved it.  Got it for him for his birthday.
1476727651|5.0|I have read most of SK novels and I have to say that this is one of his top seven. It's good to see Danny come back from The Shining as an adult and read about the evils he has faced since leaving the Lookout Hotel. It's a great read - not his best - but still fun and exciting and hard to put down.
B00E88YNJY|5.0|Love her voice and style. Definitely worth purchasing if you like bluesy, southern sounds, that resonate from a sultry vocalist who tells a story.
B00G32OER4|5.0|I like my horror movies, and although this one isn't perfect, I found it to be better than a lot of recent one's out there.  Definitely worth it to rent though, horror movies lose their appeal after you see it once (imho)
B008RA3X5E|1.0|I have purchased this app after reading wonderful reviews about it. And indeed, the way this app works is great.<br />It has many options. However, after I installed this app, my phone began draining the battery at a record time, even while the app wasn't running. I have taken a look at the battery screen on my S3 and 35 percent of the battery was drained, just from the app. The phone also got very hot, causing extreme lags and crashes on my device.<br />After removal, my phone was functioning normal again.<br />WORST download and a true shame I had to pay for this. Total waste of money.
B000CNFC76|2.0|An excellent movie, but I was unable to watch it, because of being in the wrong region and having the wrong DVD.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I have been playing this Solitaire game for over two years now. This app has the best graphics and smoothest movements of any card apps I've downloaded. Also, I've not experienced any technical problems while playing this game. I highly recommend  MobilityWare card games.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|I started this game &amp; have had a hard time putting it down. I like the graphics. My favorite is the special pieces when you match 4 or more.
B007EC27QM|5.0|Big numbers and easy to use. Works well on my Kindle Fire. I would recommend the use of this app for all ages.
B00138J7V6|1.0|who needs to buy this album? all you have to do is hang out down at the local home depot. there is nothing creative about his music at all. just watered down, focus group approved, bland songs.
B007BGQFTQ|5.0|Lots of action keeps the plot moving & the reader enthralled. Was terribly sad to reach the end if this book, thus the series. I can't help but hope we'll see Alexia & her eclectic group of friends again!
1848507836|5.0|I am enjoying this book. Haven't finished it yet though. Item was delivered quickly so I am very satisfied with the book and the service at this point.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Escaped...was fairly easy,  Level 9 &amp; 10 were a bit more challenging.  I will be glad when they add more levels.
B000ICXQXI|4.0|fun scary (but not too scary) movie.  definitely a movie to see once in your life.  especially love the ending.
1932100660|5.0|I have ordered so many books since delving into healthy organic eating. Nothing has had the impact on me than this book has. This is what you need to read if you read nothing else.
B00169N0BK|5.0|This product was required for my Color Management class at the Art Institute of Pittsburgh.  It works great and I received in a timely manner.  I would definitely recommend this product.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Best book of the series. I read this book quickly, the 2nd was just so-so and by the third, I had lost interest and didn't even finish it. The first book is the best one, sometimes a good thing should be left alone.
B000FC12C8|5.0|Even eons after Benjamin Graham wrote the book, it is still not only relevant, but, in its information and strategies, absolutely amazing.<br />Clive Varejes
B001ILFUDC|5.0|Great movie, worked great. Came with all the inserts and discs, case looks like brand new. Some Disney movies are hard to find, when Disney &#34;put them in their vault&#34; and that increases the price and makes them hard to find (annoyed that Disney does this, money making ploy, but I wanted some of the old classics for my niece.
B00C5R7F8G|5.0|This is a great, thought provoking book and there are a lot of good, informative reviews here, but I wanted to mention that although the book is over 600 pages printed only about 56% of that is the primary content. The rest is notes, index etc.
B007IXWL2C|4.0|This series is a good read, but by the 3rd one, I honestly had lost interest and never even finished it. I read the first book quick, the second was so-so, but by the third I was bored....sometimes they should leave a good thing alone in the beginning.
B001BANK32|5.0|If you can only read three books by Stephen King, my recomendation would be &#34;The Shining,&#34; &#34;11/22/63.&#34; and &#34;Christine.&#34;<br />King is the master of character development,  giving his readers a real feel for and connection with the characters.  If you saw the movie &#34;The Shining&#34; and think you know the story, think again. The movie is great, the book is way better. Or to quote a &#34;down Mainer,&#34; this book is &#34;wicked good.&#34;<br />It is helpful to read before &#34;Dr Sleep&#34; but not a prerequisite.
B0013ND30M|5.0|Great movie, worked great. Came with all the inserts and discs, case looks like brand new.

B00DW5IM9Q|3.0|As a long time Dylan fan I think the pre-release reviews on this album are much overrated.  If you have a significant number of Dylan albums you may only find a few songs you don't have. I wish I had saved my money.

B00E8KLWB4|4.0|Puzzles to solve thus far have been easy. Hidden objects somewhat more challenging. Unfortunately, I often miss at least one item. I also have to wait a lot for my energy to restore to be able to continue playing.
B007IXWKUK|4.0|Book 2 was ok, I read it a bit slower than the first book which was a pretty quick read.
B0061US58C|5.0|Liked it better than the 1st one. My son especially liked it. We'll watch it 10 more times. We should just buy it
B00003CXCQ|5.0|Great movie, worked great. Came with all the inserts and discs, case looks like brand new.

B00FEX2ZFG|5.0|Probably the best movie I've seen out of this genre. Only two movies that come close are Insidious and The Exorcism of Emily Rose. Need to watch it at night with the volume turned waaaaaay up.
B000B8QG4A|5.0|Great movie, worked great. Came with all the inserts and discs, case looks like brand new.

B005FLX2WC|5.0|Top notch stuff. John Bonamassa and Beth Hart have a special chemistry together and this album showcases it well. The guitar solos are stunning. Her nuanced performances of blues torch songs can serve as her signature. I've never heard her perform better. The production quality is first rate. The CD is good enough that I've had it on loop play in my car for over a week. I haven't got tired of it or wanted to change yet.
006097625X|1.0|I had to buy this book for a class, the class was on using Photoshop, I still have no idea what this book had to do with using Photoshop, but it was required, the whole book is written in comic form, I HATED it and never read my assignments because of this...
B00CLT31D6|2.0|Long winded and text book like.  Spends a lot of time repeating points and using examples to stretch the book out and make points.
B009HEN7LY|4.0|And glad I did because while I did enjoy the movie, I would have taken exception to paying more than $10 to watch it.  It is funny in parts and very predictable in others.
B008KOTNVA|5.0|I needed to give my mid 2009 macbook pro a tune up. The performance of my macbook has progressively increased in wait-time, battery draining, overheating, and performance. It usually takes anywhere from 60-120 seconds for my mac to load up from power start, same goes for iTunes, iPhoto, Adobe PDF Reader etc. Decided to upgrade the Battery, Ram(2GB DDR3), and HDD(160GB 5400 RPM) to a New Battery, 8GB Ram, and 256GB Solid State hard drive.<br /><br />What a drastic improvement this tune up has down for my four year old Macbook Pro!!!<br /><br />However, the Macbook Pro has very specific screws that require non-traditional tools to remove/insert components. I thought I my glasses repair kit would have everything I needed...I was so wrong and also stripped the screws that held in the components.<br /><br />Not only did this 54 Bit Driver Kit have ALL the necessary heads for my tune-up but iFixit had a comprehensive step by step list/video tutorial process for success.
B00G9U7R2O|5.0|Watched it thrice in the theaters, Monsters University is the best family release I've seen in a while. The older kids loved it and the youngest (4yo) stayed interested the entire film. Well worth watching again and again due to the engaging story.
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|I Love this show! So rare for a show to this mind blowing, compelling, chemistry between huge ensemble, plots, and twist are all oscar worthy.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Loved the books didn't want to put it down, sad it is over great story. Enjoyed the mystery entwined and his story of being abused and how it affected him and his need of his wicked sexual desires.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Great app easy to use  a nust app works grear. Can't bear it for free. Iworks great on z galaxy s3
B00DGMVJAO|3.0|Enjoyed story, and visuals. Storytellers did a good job of wrapping up the story, it was fun being transported to a fantasy land. An interesting take on the &#34;Jack & the Beanstalk&#34; fairytale.
B009LDCZ7I|5.0|I have not yet watched the Second Season of Homeland (GREAT SHOW), but when the first season arrived (also purchased from Broadway Bargains) there was a cd missing.  I did not realize that until I wrote that review and when I realized a ce  was missing.  I wrote Broadway Bargains and they immediately sent me another copy of The First Season free of charge.  Watching this series on dvd/cd us a great way to see Homeland TV series without having to pay for Showtime every month.  It is nice to purchase from a company like Broadway Bargains that understands and does their utmost to please customers.
B00DGNO3WE|4.0|I enjoyed the competitive nature of the characters, and the actors portraying the characters. I enjoy seeing people older than age 40 in film because it reminds me one can still enjoy life past age 50 ( or 60, 70, etc). The script wrapped up the story line nicely. Enjoyed watching it, laughed a bit.
0553582011|3.0|So I received the book the other day and was disappointed with the quality of the binding. The first few pages were falling out and were cut very close to the type. Other than that the book is a great read.
B00CSYRHG6|5.0|Another great film to watch with the family. At first the movie was confusing to me, but then again I had two very excited kids to watch this film with me. I think its worth while to watch over, and over again. His movies just keep getting more stuff in it every time. When I watch it again i spot something else i missed the first time, and its like wow thats cool how they put that in the movie. The story is wonderful, heart warming, and at times confusing. I have seen almost all of his films, and I cant wait for more to come out.
0316017922|4.0|I long suspected that success isn't JUST a matter of hard work, but rather a matter of Talent plus Work plus Circumstances.  Gladwell proves it, and tells us what the Circumstances are.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|This is a good game my kids love it but its no my cup of tee .  If you get time try this game you mite like it.
0316010669|4.0|When I first read &#34;Blink&#34; i was disappointed that it was not &#34;The Tipping Point&#34; over again.  &#34;Tipping&#34; was magnificent - such breakthrough ideas, and so well illustrated and organized that I could rattle off the major points to friends.  Blink has ideas, but not the same descriptive organizing framework.  But 3 years after reading 'Blink&#34; - I still remember some of the stories from it.  It's good enough I am inviting it to share a little of the precious real estate on my bookshelf.
B00BD99JMW|4.0|This is the third time this year I've waited for the final book of a trilogy, and it's the third time I've been let down by the author.  No plot at all, a point of view  by two characters who were indistinguishable, and a confusing explanation about the rise of the factions make this book one that is not only dull, but difficult to pick up and read.  Veronica Roth owed her readers much more than this book delivered.  However, I gave it a four-star rating because I do think she is an incredible writer who just fell far short of an anticipated mark this time.
0312945973|5.0|Best author I have read bar none, have all his books, read many them  of the over and over.<br />Hard books to put down
B007J4T2G8|4.0|I was a skeptic. But after reading the first book, it's definitely enticing.  I only started this over-talked about book to understand why my usually straight-laced coworker was intrigued.
B008602KQI|5.0|Great movie! Watched it with the wife and can't wait to see the second one coming out soon! Can't wait!
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|What else can I say?  I love superheroes, video games, and movies so this flick had everything I could have wanted and more.
B006LSZECO|3.0|WAY too long for my taste. Felt like way too much filler and too many unncessary details. I found myself skipping large portions of chapters just to get through it. It wasn't necessarily a bad book but just seemed to drag on and on and on.
B00G8YZ48K|5.0|I worried about this season. Could they keep the same level of interest as previous? Were they running out of ideas?<br />Turns out no.  The show is fantastic. It's devloped new characters and given depth to old ones.
B00FI7XBIS|5.0|I love this game. I can play for hours. Very happy it was the free app of the day for the Kindle this week.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|It is the best game ever it has things from the movies and it has the minions. There are lots of people who play it. It has the minion beach El Machos lair and resadental too.
B00DH7P6WU|5.0|This is a super cute doll. I always loved the Monster High series and this will be just something new to start. The dolls are completely different than their predecessors. They are so cute and their stories that come on the back of the tags &#34;Royal&#34; or &#34;Rebel&#34; are very interesting to read. Something any child (or adult) could love.<br /><br />The guys are stockier than the Monster High Dolls. Suiting for a Prince or Huntsman, and the girls are a bit more chibi than than Monster High girls. A bit less glam which is suitable for a princess.<br /><br />Remember to watch the series at everafterhigh.com!!!! This is great because it will show the many descendents of the fairy tale characters stories and it brings out morals and a realistic twist to the stories. Such as a royal princess dating a rebel huntsman. Very cute and sincere. =D
B00CNQ7HAU|4.0|Another great reading by John Grisham.  Lots of characters to keep up with... great storyline.  Will recommend this book. Rate it 4 1/2 stars.
B004LUS390|5.0|This program seems to work great. My granddaughter loves it and uses it all the time. she says it works better with the stylus than her fingers
B009HXG9UQ|4.0|Low budget movie, simple plot, Offbeat presentation. If you like &#34;shoot 'em, blow 'em&#34; kind of movies, don't bother. Leaves you with food for thought. Highly recommend!
B009WO7NQO|5.0|its fun, and has a lot of new tweeks and fun additions to the characters that make it more fun
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Love it was soo happy to see I could get it on my kindle fire I'm soo addicted!!!! The HD makes such a difference.
B00BD99JMW|2.0|The ending kills it for me...I'm sorry she had me until the end...what a waste...the fist two books are brilliant but then it's like she just ran out of ideas
B009KS4XRO|3.0|I like the game but have been very frustrated by not being allowed to enter the winning daub of a game. Many forfeitures have happened because there is no time to get in the daub after the last number is called. Maddening..I may continue to play or I may not.
B0053JJLLC|4.0|Very entertaining. Not Mr. Crichton's best but still a good read. Enjoyed the story line. Maybe someday it will come to pass.
B007THA4FI|3.0|Very different than J.K. Rowling 's other books but it is interesting and the characters are very intricate. I appreciated a different writing style...but beware it's not what you expect!
B0074JOCIG|5.0|Joe Bonamassa Beacon Theatre - Live From New York (Blu Ray) has very good quality of audio and video. Joe Bonamassa is delivering unforgettable performance.
B00EGMQIJ0|2.0|I was really looking forward to reading this book as I'm a big fan of the genre (Daniel Suarez, etc.) but the only thing I came away with is how naive the protagonist Mae Holland is and how naive Eggers must expect his reader to be to even believe that a person like Mae could exist. I suppose there is someone out there who would do whatever they were told without asking any questions, especially by ebullient supervisors, but to not have any question in their mind about the morality of what's going on.... its so simplistic and in some respects disrespectful of the reader. Even the narrative itself, while being described as a \\"Techno-thriller\\" is hardly thrilling.  Never do we feel that any of characters, other than some creepy deep sea fish, were in real danger, Any danger implied is to society assuming that we are all filled with bubble-headed boobies like Mae Holland.<br /><br />One other thing that really did not sit well with me was the very abrupt ending of the story.  There is a climax to the \\"action\\" but in any sense there is no real resolution and the final moments can probably be predicted about 1/4 way through the book.
B000W00Y0Y|5.0|Queen: Rock Montreal & Live Aid (Blu Ray) has very good quality of audio and video. This legendary band delivers unforgettable performance.
B003G4W49C|4.0|And thoroughly enjoyable tale.  Leaves you wanting to keep reading the series.  Very well developed universe and characters.  Sci-Fi that is truly sci-fi.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I can't wait to see the movie and looking forward to the next book in this series.  Well written story.
B005KELW26|5.0|This cover fits my kindle perfectly and looks great. I am very happy with it, particularly the nice bright purple color.
B005CRQ4XI|5.0|First of all, this is not a How to Book on Hiking the PCT.  It is a book about a young woman trying to find herself and make sense of her life.  She does so by hiking a portion of the PCT.  Along the way she makes mistakes and learns from them.  This is a well written and entertaining book.
B00G2SIW7M|5.0|i was fearful going into this when i heard it was a dance album but it is more of a high energy rock album. if you like actung baby you will love this
0062265911|5.0|This was a birthday gift for my sister.  She loves Agatha Christie and can listen to this CD on her way to and from work.  It helps pass the time of a long drive.
B001L5YW9I|5.0|This has always been one of my favorite movies.  It had been a long time since I had viewed it, and I was anxious to see if I enjoyed now as much as I use to.  I was not disappointed.
B00F880I7E|5.0|I can not say enough about this series.  In the spirit of Breaking Bad, and Prison Break, this edgy series uses a background of Zombies, but focuses on human nature.  It is well worth watching.....But like the aforementioned titles, you must start with Ep 1, Season 1, or don''t bother....it is well worth the investment in time, to see the characters evolve.  Watch the Sheriff's son...this young actor is doing a superb job of character development.<br /><br />This series is not for the faint of heart.  It is graphic in its depiction of blood and guts, but it is also strangely acceptable, unlike the \\"Saw\\" series of movies.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Incredibly easy to set up - We LOVE our Chromecast!! After a year with a Belkin Screencast that ALWAYS had problems (and NO customer service), we couldn't be happier.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|so much fun an  i love killing minions because they r fluffy and cool and fun to play with at school so kuch fun
1451666179|5.0|Okay, maybe that's a bit of a hyperbole, but that's what this book calls for, right?<br />Allie Brosh shares never-before-seen content in the style of her world-famous &#34;Hyperbole and a Half&#34; blog, as well as a selection of her fans' favorite stories from her site.<br />Ever wonder how Allie would tackle a home invasion by wild waterfowl? What her childhood experiences with mother-daughter outdoor bonding were like? Now you can find out!<br /><br />Definitely has &#34;Alot&#34; of good content...though no Alots.
B006LSZECO|4.0|&#34;Gone Girl&#34; was a very entertaining book and a quick read (since I was so eager to find out what happened next!). The twist was a surprise and the first part of the book was very well written. However, it seemed to lose momentum once more was revealed and the ending was rather anti-climactic. I would recommend as a quick beach read.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|fun and relaxing helpful for unwinding after work.<br />easy to play for long or short periods of time while doing other tasks
B003PIUC02|5.0|what an awesome show. I  bought this based on a recommendation from a friend.  what an excellently written show.  and no commercials!
B006M7JCC2|5.0|What a marvelously written book, and out of the world experience.<br />Have been reading some of the pages again and again, just to get the philosophy ingrained.<br />Have recommended this book to many of my friends.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I use this everyday on class to help making note sharing easier, it's one of the best apps to get.
1449430295|5.0|I love Dilbert. In college I got into the habit of using the desk calendars for tracking time. There's just something about ripping off a page each day. Plus, it makes me laugh.
B00979CS50|5.0|Uncle Neil did it again. Love this album. We listen to it a lot and really crank it up. Thanks Neil
B006ZS4SXQ|5.0|There about something in Lego's quality and customer service that I've learned to appreciate over the years. I bought this Crawler to my 9 years old youngest boy and the moments of joy and happiness are certainly worth the money.<br /><br />The (very long) instruction manuals divided into three parts that carefully describe every stage with some of the parts (like the rods) pictured in real life size.<br /><br />The model itself is very detailed and the mechanical gear parts are highly detailed and simply amazing.<br /><br />One tiny bit of disappointment my boy had was seeing that the vehicle itself actually move very slowly so I had to explain him the speed/force relationship with vehicles, but other than that you get a real in-House 4x4 vehicle that is fun to control and seeing it going over all the mess there is in his room...probably the only thing that can run in his room safely :)
1574216988|4.0|Enjoyed this book. Doing Zentangle is much simpler than I expected -- the book is that clear and kind of fun too.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Love that game this is one of the best game I ever play actually I almost forsake the other games that l play
B000LXQVA4|5.0|I had exersaucers with my older two girls and I thought this jumperoo would be similar for my new little ones...I was way wrong!  This jumperoo is so cool...my twin girls choose it over every other jumperoo or exeraaucer they have tried.  Before I realized how much better the rainforest jumperoo was than other jumpers, I also bought the Evenflo ExerSaucer Jump and Learn Jumper, Jungle Quest from Costco but both of my twin babies last so much longer, jump so much higher, and have sooo much more fun in the rainforest jumperoo.
1476727651|1.0|I ordered a book from NewBUTCheaper and it never came. I cannot seem to get in touch with anyone to resolve this issue.<br />Here is the worst of it - there is NO way to get in touch with Amazon.com to complain about a seller who is stealing!

B005LAIHEA|5.0|LOVE this movie! I might be a little biased, but its pretty great! Definately a good addition to my collection.
B0048KXRR6|3.0|I watched the first one and thought it was great but didn't care much for this one. It was okay though probably would have been better had I not seen the first one
B00ADQCBEY|5.0|Great fast paced program.  Once you watch a season you are hooked & will look forward to each episode til the end of production
B001V5CIFI|5.0|I watched this and thought it was a very good movie. I know its a kid movie but I enjoyed it as it has no foul language or suggestive themes.
B00FFRAKRG|5.0|Korn and I always had a tenuous relationship, but this is a phenomenal album. Still distinctly Korn, but with a new, very well thought out delivery to their style. I recommend highly.
B008RKIACK|5.0|Holds its place even after over 30 years.  I could watch this movie thousands of times, and still be entertained.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Each level gets progressively more difficult and requires you to solve step by step the way to escape the level.  This is a fun game and one that will make you scratch your head from time to time.  I highly recommend it and look forward to the addition of more levels.
B000AJIF4E|3.0|After reading all the reviews, both professional and amateur here, I bought these.  I'm not thrilled - the soundstage is relatively narrow, bass, though present is a bit muffled.  The coiled cord is a major pain in the neck.
B0018OIK0E|5.0|Zombie horror, comedy at it's best. Top on my Halloween viewing list right next to Young Frankenstein. This movie has all the elements I love - great acting, comic energy, a modicum of gruesomeness and slow moving zombies. Yeah!
B00BD6RFFS|5.0|The best business planning book I have read in years. Useful for clarifying strategy either individually or with a group.<br />Fantastic for idea generation that enables immediate execution.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|What makes this game interesting is having different types of goals to achieve.  I don't like it associated with face book because you have to ask friends to get you to the next level...so you are stopped at times waiting for friends to open levels for you.  Takes at least 3 different friends for each level.  Playing it not connected with face book allows you to play at will and not wait for friends to unlock the next level. Some of the objectives that require finishing within a certain time, can be too fast for me and it takes a really lucky setup for me to achieve that individule game.  Some other of the challenging individual games require a random setup that will allow a win.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I honestly believe thatsubwaysurfer is one of the best games I've ever played and it is more fun especially when you are . Facing your friend  it really challenges you but I am a very competitive person so as soon as I saw the high score I had to beat there was no messing about!! THE GAME IS GREAT WHOEVER MADE IT MAKE MORE VERSIONS XXXX
1476727651|5.0|Stephen King is a hit-or-miss author for me.  I enjoyed The Shining (but still haven't worked up the gumption to watch the movie), but It fell flat.  I read Under the Dome and it infuriated me (stereotypes of any sort do that to me) but The Green Mile made me weep with sympathy.  It was only because I enjoyed my time reading The Shining that I decided to pick up Doctor Sleep from the library.  The result?  Well.. keep reading!<br /><br />One of the things I loved about The Shining was the slow burn.  I kept expecting the horror to come out and smack me in the face, but the story just slowly built and built until I was so immersed that I was flipping pages without any thought to heedlessly running into the \\"scary bits.\\"  And scary bits they were.  The same was true for me with Doctor Sleep.  Once again, I was reminded of what it was like to read an unputdownable book, and that's saying something considering the bulky weight of Doctor Sleep.  I was thoroughly entranced with young Abra, felt so much concern and pity for Dan, and was fascinated at the concept of the True Knots.  I mean, think about it - those big RV's are sure to hide all sorts of secrets!<br /><br />The other thing I completely appreciated was the growth of Dan.  As a child, he faced demons that would have had me curled up in the corner of a room, refusing to go anywhere and it's obvious that, although it did not have that effect on Dan, he still was left with demons - both in the form of deathly creatures as well as addiction.  The sub-story to Doctor Sleep is that of the journey of an alcoholic and it's a moving story.  I was rooting for Dan with all of my might while at the same time so afraid of what it would do to him to get involved back in the situation that encouraged it in the first place.<br /><br />There were no dull parts to this story.  The guilt of Dan, the innocence of Abra, and the sheet evil of the True Knot group made each section of the story interesting as the focus switched from the first to the second to the third.  As much as I enjoyed The Shining, it could not boast of holding my attention as closely as Doctor Sleep did and, for this on-and-off-again reader of Stephen King I'll just say that if he continues to put out work like this one, I'll be checking them out as soon as they are on the shelf.e first to the second to the third.

B00B9HTK1S|3.0|If you're looking for a classic this is it, a classic murder mystery with all its thrills. I however read this book for a class but when I bought the narration it was easier to comprehend and in fact a good read.
B001FB4W0C|5.0|This season is just as good as the others. Keeps you wanting more. Great price too...kudos Amazon! I know where I'll be doing my shopping from now on!
B0028RXXFC|5.0|This series about Rome features Julius Caesar's reign, and includes the young life of Emperor Augustus (Octavian). Octavian is the one who is famous for threatening to drag Cleopatra through the streets of Rome as his prisoner. (She killed herself rather than allow that to happen.)<br /><br />Rome is one of the best series ever produced for television. The quality of writing, sets, acting, and directing is up there with other great series like Madman, Breaking Bad, Deadwood, Band of Brothers, Game of Thrones and Dexter, to name a few.
B002JVWRAO|5.0|The show is a very good show with a lot of interesting concepts. The whole demon and angel thing is getting a little redundant. I liked it better when things weren't always so serious and they were hunting different things. But still a very good show
B00B7VZN76|5.0|I had the older DVD version and this has the clarity that the prior was lacking.  Blu Ray is the way to go.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|I ditched cable and went 100% google chromecast.  I love this thing.  Works like a charm all the time, great access to all my desired content.  The best part of this thing is that you use a cell phone, tablet, or any computer connected to the same wireless as the remote control.  You can literally choose a show to watch and then completely turn off the device used to select said show.  No battery drain, no streaming through the cell phone, tablet or computer.  Just easy and awesome streaming.

B00C7JG0KG|5.0|A very nice prequel to the legendary film.  I highly recommend adding to your collection. James Franco does a great job!
B00E1SM5UA|1.0|This is not what fans expect from artist on such a level as Mr. Di Meola. We want fusion....SYMBOLS DRUMS CORDS STRING PIANO.... ALL THAT!!!! For my personal taste it was a bust, maybe someday in the future when I'm 65 years old I might start to feel him on this one but for now I want it hard hitting fused.
B0095XPZBC|5.0|I had the older DVD version and this has the clarity that the prior was lacking.  Blu Ray is the way to go.
B00DJYJPLO|1.0|I was anxious to see this movie but by the time it ended I was hating on both the characters.  The dialog in the car scene at first had me interested but by the time they had moved to the dinner scene I was bored.  The conversations were NOT professional.  What couple talks & talks like they did the first half of the movie without interjecting some off the topic comments.  The conversations were too rehearsed in that there was no believability in them.  By the time they made it to the hotel room I was disgusted.  Delphys character turned into the biggest bitch and Hawke turned in to the most graveling husband and I was sickened by him.  When she left the hotel room in a huff I could NOT understand why Hawke's character would bother going to look for her.  I would have thought  - let that bitch go stew in her own hatefulness.  I could not stand either one of them.<br />Delphy's dress was saggy and gross and didn't help her character at all.  She seemed so raggin on herself & so selfish at the end that she made me mad.  I wouldn't waste my $ on this movie.  It could have been so much better had the writers created a more loving or understandable characters they had evolved into instead of hateful, bitter old crows.  This is just my opinion.  I am sad that it was so poorly written and poorly acted.
B007A4SDCG|5.0|Read if you no longer buy into your own bs about being too busy, too blocked, too anything to write. This is a pitiless, merciless dissection of the lies we tell ourselves followed by a simple roadmap  to get the work done. If you are angry about your own inability to confront the blank page, BUY THE BOOK!!
B0064NTZQ2|5.0|This movie had me screeching while watching it.  I don't usually care to watch violence & I think I hid my eyes a few times but I couldn't wait to see what the characters would do next.  The acting was absolutely the best.  The ending was stunning.  I love this movie and bought it for my 24 yr old to watch.
B0057UAE54|5.0|What more can be said. You're either a fan or you aren't.  The sound quality is good enough for me to use while driving or otherwise just wanting to hear some good classic rock.
B002VRZEYM|4.0|Solid documentary about mass food production and the companies that controlled them.  You might think twice about what you eat after watching this film.  I know I have.

B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Grisham does it again. Creates a read that you simply can't put down. Twists and turns that keep you hanging. Love this book.
6304696558|5.0|This is a nonstop laugh a minute movie that will have you rolling in the aisles. highly recommended to any age
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Fun and exciting game with those hilarious minions. Really love the different reactions when you bump into things like lasers, rockets, flames, vehicles or minions.
B0018PH3L0|5.0|this is one of the most perfectly made westerns in all the years of movie making and is for any western buff
B008UCJ7KO|2.0|MY HEART LOVES... but something is missing!<br /><br />I feel completely let down, and we now know Eva and Gideon’s story is being extended for a fourth installment. To be honest, I am not sure what or how to even write about Entwined. It wasn’t bad, but it certainly did not live up to expectations created at the end of Reflected in You. I’m not sure where the story is going, or where this one leaves us. I really love Eva and feel she deserves a fantastic story – but this book just doesn’t deliver. This was the story to nowhere as there was no new story plot. I didn't care  about Megumi being sick and missing work. What was that all about?? I love Cary and want his love life to get back on track and learn who he'd choose at the end? For $10, this book just wasn't worth the purchase. Keep in mind, books CAN be returned to Amazon!! Well, I'll just skip the next two installments and assume they live happily ever after, how about that?! This is one blogger that will not finish the series. My guess is this one was just a filler so that we will buy book four OR tune into the television show.  WHAT???? This on television???? Yuck!! FLAT LINED………THAT’S THE ONLY WAY TO DESCRIBE THIS ONE.

159420411X|3.0|If you are fascinated in predicting elections and baseball statistics this will be an interesting book, if not then less so.  Silver has been very successful in predicting in both of these areas. He also does a good job on explaining the difficulties of predicting the weather, and finds that this area has had the most improvement.  He has an interesting approach to thinking about probabilities using Bayes theorem. Areas such as earthquake, stock market, and economic prediction have shown virtually no improvement and remain difficult and almost impossible to predict accurately.  A few people like Jan Hatzius are closer to developing more accurate methods in the economics and investing area.<br /><br />Coincidence in correlations is inevitable when you realize there are millions of possible correlations with the economic or any other data. It is inevitable that some will correlate, but the relation is a coincidence.  Jan Hatzius, Silvers favorite economist, says it is very difficult to find what is actually causal, i.e., when one causes the other. They are not just correlated, but one actually causes the other.  Another problem is that once a prediction is made the people who read it may change their behavior to counteract the prediction, and other factors may appear which were not taken into account.<br /><br />Silver gives a number of examples of Bayes theorem, which is a way of adjusting the probability of something occurring as we get additional information. He compares this with RA Fisher’s frequentism that is concerned with uncertainty caused by sampling part of a universe instead of the whole thing.  It emphasizes errors intrinsic to an experiment and ignores human error and bias. Fisher predicted that there was correlation but no causation between smoking and lung cancer. In fact he argued that cancer caused people to smoke!  This actually is a good trick to apply, to exchange what we see as a cause with its effect and see how it plays.  There is a trend invarious scientific fields to move more toward the Bayesian method.<br /><br />Silver has some interesting insights into chess and shows in Kasparov vs. IBM’s Deep Thought chess playing computer, how each side tried to discern the others weakness and exploit it.  For instance Kasparov tried to make prepping the computer ineffective by choosing openings that he never used before so the computer needed to do more calculation.  Some chess tournaments now allow human teams to work with computer programs of their choice against other teams.<br /><br />Silver has taken part in big poker tournaments and as in chess gives detailed examples and probability diagrams to use to evaluate an opponents hand range.<br /><br />On stock markets he explores Fama’s efficient-market hypothesis ( you can’t use information or analysis to beat a market) and concludes that it is mostly true about 90% of the time, but is not true during huge, critical up’s and downs.  Especially black swans (Taleb) or dragon kings (Sornette). Robert Schiller, recent Nobel prize winner, has shown that when the P/E calculated over the previous ten years, correlates with the value of the S&P 500 market. When this ten year P/E for the S&P 500 is low-10, the market produces a 9% return, if the P/E is over 30, the return is negative.  In markets and gambling it is easier to win against naïve players.<br /><br />Silver analyzes global warming and especially Jim Hansen whose predictions have been a bit high.  He goes over different facets of climate change and rightfully points out that the temperature has actually been cooling for the last decade. He explains that this might be due to China burning coal with sulfur that forms sulfur compounds in the atmosphere that cause cooling.  He doesn’t compare it to the enormously larger amount of carbon dioxide that is emitted at the same time and causes warming. Nor does he discuss the way to measure the temperature of the entire Earth to tenths of a degree accuracy. The greenhouse effect (has been studied under lab conditions), and increasing concentrations of greenhouse gases are highly probable, but the long-term effects are much more in question.  Till long-term effects are better understood and proven Silver believes scientists would do better to research more and let increasingly solid facts do their arguing. For scientists whose work indicates we are close to a tipping point with really bad consequences and who think it will take lots of time to reverse effects feel a strong need to take action now. In the end we may be forced to remove greenhouse gases with methods similar to George Olah’s suggestions on the methanol economy ([[ASIN:3527324224 Beyond Oil Gas Methanol Economy]]<br /><br />The main thread through the book is the application of Bayes theorem to wide areas.  It requires an estimate of how likely an event or phenomena is, then we do research and weigh the evidence.  We form a forecast as to the likelihood then adjust the forecast or hypothesis as we get more information. The adjustment is done with Bayes theorem.<br /><br />As an example in the climate change area Silver guesses 95% as an initial confidence that global temperatures are increasing, when global temperatures actually decreased over the last ten years, the confidence changes to 85%.  If you were 99% confident initially then the probability drops to 28% using Bayes theorem.  So if we are very confident, and we find strong evidence against our hypothesis we should drop our confidence down quite a bit.

B000LB4DWO|4.0|This version of Superman is not my favorite - I guess the studio execs agreed since they re-vamped the whole idea this year. But I still enjoyed this. It was a fun movie and I love super heroes.

B00G32OER4|5.0|This is a truly great scary movie!, good actors and a great acting job!, this is one of those movies that you will watch and you won't be able to take your eyes off of the TV-screen!, I would definitely recommend it to people that love to see a good scary movie! and I meant you will be scared through the hall movie okay, thanks
B00AO3K01C|4.0|I really like this book.<br />Also how it approaches suicide, bullying ,hacking, respect, grace, valor, transendance, karma and more. from different angles.<br /><br />RV
B000XXLY6I|4.0|Read all the reviews talking about how the boots come in up to 1 size too large so i emailed customer support at Timberland, polite lady there told me to just order what i normally wear. Boots arrived in Australia from the US in 4 days (pretty amazing) and fit PERFECTLY.<br /><br />Either they've stepped up their quality control or a lot of people just have no idea what shoe size they wear. It's not too hard people, measure your foot and look up the chart online.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I  loved it. Can't wait until the next season is aired!!!  Then I can watch them all together! enough said!

076531178X|5.0|Sanderson is a genius and a master of the fiction world. This book basically got Sanderson the job of finishing the Wheel of Time series. It's very well thought out and an awesome delineated magic system.
B00EGMQIJ0|4.0|I really liked this book. It was engaging, interesting and thought provoking. While transparency is good, how much is realistic? The thought that wanting privacy is anti-social is frightening. The feeling of validity or popularity because your circle smiles or frowns at your experience, would make most people basket cases. This is a good read that is best by not comparing it to literature (ex. 1984) but as a novel.
0385743564|5.0|I started by reading the free prologue online. Then I read the free first 5 chapters at Sanerson's blog. I bought the book before I was done with the 5 chapters and I wasn't disappointed at all. I look forward to the next one.

B00BHBBSZ2|1.0|It will turn on but every time I move my finger it draws all over the place.Also it types very slowly. It's almost impossible to use because of all the glitches. You can only do little shapes if you draw. I really don't like this app.
031623480X|1.0|This book has a few good points on eating too much grain and has a good chapter on the dangers of gluten.  But the rest of the book tells us that really high cholestrol is good for you and you can eat as much fat as you want as our primal ancestors did so 10000 years ago.  This is untrue and dangerous.  Our diet should come from a balanced mixed of raw(natural)  or unboxed and unprocessed as possible.<br />I never use magarine always butter as margarine is nothing but a chemical compound but i dont think 60 percent of my diet should come from animal fats.<br />Also ever point he relates to his fathers alzeimers.

B00EGMQIJ0|3.0|The book started out very well but i think it got more and more improbable as the story started to draw towards a conclusion.  Still, if you merged Google, Facebook, Genentech, and the NSA I guess it might be plausible.  But - still a fun read...
B004FGMDOQ|5.0|This story captivated me from the beginning.  I highly recommend it! I can't wait for the rest of the story.
B008JFUQZ2|1.0|I was so hoping this sci-fi action movie would be fun to watch with a decent story line and good acting with well known actors present. This movie had none of the above. It was a minus 2. Please do yourself a big favor, it is not worth the price for a disc, not worth the price at a movie theater and not worth the money the producers spent to make this unbelievable nonsense!
B000VYX8PE|5.0|Love the book. Lemony snicker has a very particular style, first series that keep my 10 year old daughter interested. I really enjoyed reading it too

B0012NVGHU|2.0|I found the movie dull, slow moving, uninteresting. The characters seemed very unrealistic to me. I turned it off after 15 minutes or so.
B00ADQCBEY|4.0|I liked this series, a little violent but I thought the the actors were good, and the story lines were interesting.
B00000IZOR|3.0|We bought this because we had one when we were young. Part of the fun was pulling it around which is still possible with this one but the biggest fun was &#34;talking&#34; on the phone. The cord on this newer version is about 4 inches long so you can't &#34;talk&#34;. I realize this may be for safety reasons, but very disappointing.
B00G32MPWU|3.0|There was a bit of Homage to the old &#34;Spaghetti Westerns.&#34;  The head bad guy was named &#34;Red Cavenaugh&#34; , which was the name of one of the minor bad guys in &#34;For a Few Dollars More&#34;, one of Clint Eastwood's early movies.<br /><br />Red was played by Anthony Michael Hall...  Remember when he was a sort of girly looking skinny geek?  He sure has changed from his Sixteen Candles days; A bulked up, grizzly Macho Man now.<br /><br />Danny Trejo was, of course, Danny Trejo.  He did a much better acting job in Machete, though.<br /><br />The cinematography wasn't great, but not quite as bad as some previous reviewers warned.  Lots of plot holes, even considering that this was a low budget horror -western- schlock-exploitation flick.  Lots of continuity errors too:  For instance:  Danny had some pretty neat pistols, somewhat reminiscent if the Lefaucheux that often morphed into regular  'six shooters'.<br /><br />Mickey Roarke made a pretty good 'Lucifer'<br /><br />A few topless scenes with 'bar girls' that were a lot prettier than your typical ladies for hire were in the real old west.<br /><br />I wouldn't want to pay theater prices to see this movie, but it is an OK way to waste an hour and forty minutes of mindless  violent entertainment.
0812550706|5.0|Book was a required read for my daughter's 7th grade. She and i both enjoyed the selection. Kept us both hanging in suspense.
0670024856|4.0|Elizabeth Gilbert's new book, The Signature of All Things was a wonderful read. Her characters drew me in and I was completely charmed by them and the storyline - well done Ms. Gilbert with this beautiful and expansive piece of fiction after the success of Eat, Pray, Love & Committed. My only critique - at the end of the novel I did long and wish for...more closure, more fulfillment - something, deeper, richer. Something the sealed me into the signature of all things. And still it was a supreme tale and well told/written.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|JOHN GRISHAM has another best seller. An excellent book with a lot of  what could be history but more importantly a glimpse  of this countries still active racism and the millions trying to put it behind us.

B000XUBFE2|5.0|This beautifully written book is the newest addition to my list of all-time favorites.  The truly unique portrait of &#34;Death&#34; as a character and narrator is brilliantly conceived and the story told delivers powerful emotional truth.  And beyond the power of the story, Zusak's prose is often more like poetry, painting both the physical world and the humans who inhabit it with a unique brush.  It was so beautifully written, I had to repeatedly fight the urge to force other people to read or listen to passages.  I highly recommend this book to anyone who loves reading not just books, but literature!

This is truly the top program for email (and I use Touchdown full version now).  Well deserving of all the positive reviews.<br />--------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />Could be the leader in its class but not while only Pop3 and Imap capable.

0786838655|5.0|This is the first book in my all time favorite series. We picked it up on a whim years ago, and now my entire family and almost all of my friends are hooked! I highly recommend for anyone over the age of 12 (can be a bit dark for anything younger). So funny! And I learned more Greek history from this series than any reference books I had tried. You can't read this series without learning something. And to top it all off, everything is beautifully written.<br />One disclaimer: if you read this, be prepared to read more! You will become addicted to Percy Jackson and his adventures!
B00FAPF5U0|2.0|if you guys did not require a ticket to ride for each level. Very frustrating when your friends don't respond to request. Leveling up should be based on the number of stars you get and not dependent on others to help you through. I know you can pay to play but who does that? It is a waste of time just playing the game and I do not want to waste my money too. I will say however the game is very addicting.
B0000C9ZBW|1.0|This watch band is very thin and the metal wires in it are breaking.  It catches on everything and is now unwearable.  It is only 6 months old.What a shame. It is a beautiful watch
B002LAM7PI|2.0|It's Halloween night, it's raining like crazy, my 8 yr old daughter is bored, so I get the idea to rent a \\"spooky\\" movie. This is rated PG so it can't be that bad, can it? Yep, it can. This movie is very rating-inappropriate and definitely not for an 8 yr old. It is so sad that this is what we get for \\"kids\\" entertainment in these times. However, I must give it some credit: if you are old and crazy enough to be doing acid or other psychedelics this will be a fantastic movie for you.

0143038583|5.0|Could not put it down.  It read like a thriller.  From our beginnings to the present, our food, how we grow it how we process it and the politics behind it all.  A lot has changed since the days of early farming and a lot of what is called food today is not what we think it to be.
B00EVU3S4U|2.0|There are subtle truths associated to some Hollyweird productions that no one - certainly not the media - like to talk about: for example, there are some directors who clout both domestically and internationally is strong enough that an average picture gets an above-average critical endorsement.  This assures both the studio, its creditors, and its stars that being part of an \\"Insert Critically-Favored Director's Name Here\\" automatically earns you `street cred' with the media establishment.  Where this truth really comes into play is when said director releases a below-average picture - one that probably would end up being little more than a direct-to-DVD product much less granted a theatrical run - and everyone rushes to label it as acceptable, despite the fact that it may be bloated, forgettable, or entirely self-absorbed.<br /><br />(NOTE: The following review will contain minor spoilers necessary solely for the discussion of plot and characters.  If you're the kind of reader who prefers a review entirely spoiler-free, then I'd encourage you to skip down to the last three paragraphs for my final assessment.  If, however, you're accepting of a few modest hints at `things to come,' then read on ...)<br /><br />Isabelle James (played by current `it girl' Noomi Rapace) is a talented advertising designer.  Unfortunately, she finds herself largely being wasted, used, and abused by her current boss, Christine Stanford (played by former `it girl' Rachel McAdams).  Neither woman can deny a curious attraction between them, but when Isabelle decides to put her work as a viral sensation on the web Christine realizes she can no longer take credit for it.  The two find themselves at odds, and, unless they can get their respective passions under control, it all might end up in murder!<br /><br />It's occasionally difficult to say why a picture fails to work; this is especially the case when, at first glance, the film would seem to have all of the right ingredients.  Talented stars.  Hot-looking ladies.  International setting.  Desire.  Lust.  Betrayal.  And sex!  You name it, and methinks you can find something all audiences look for in a suspense film.  Ultimately, PASSION may suffer from being an Americanized remake - the French long ago proved they were masters of the sensual thriller - so perhaps something ends up being lost in translation.  I tend to think my disaffection for it stems from the fact that there wasn't a single likeable characters in there, but maybe I'm just an old fuddy duddy.  Sure, it all looks quite swell, but I guess it's safe to say that when De Palma is off his game, everybody suffers ... including the audience.<br /><br />Rapace's character is essentially enlisted to carry the weight of the picture; as such, my guess is that she's intended to be played up as the sympathetic victim.  After all, this is one of staples of the sensual thriller - give the viewers someone they either identify with and/or root for.  However, her Isabelle clearly is engaging in a whole host of inappropriate relationships - she's sleeping with Christine's lover behind her back, she's flirting with Christine every chance she gets, and she's stringing along one of her design assistants in yet a third potentially sexual relationship - so I found it increasingly difficult to `like' her character.<br /><br />In contrast, it looked to me as if McAdam's Christine was deliberately being telegraphed to serve as the production's villain from the get-go.  In her early scenes, she obviously manipulating everyone around her for her own personal gain and/or gratification.  However, midway through the film, the script allows the audience to see her with her guard down - having disenfranchised her closest friends, she's now taken to dialing any number in her Little Black Book in order to find an immediate conquest to satisfy her somewhat twisted desires.  I can't help but wonder if giving her that dimension was a mistake - are we know to sympathize with the central villain?<br /><br />Maybe the intent here was to serve up a narrative twist - present two characters, establish their roles, and then make the audience do an about-face.  If so, then why take such an uncalculated gamble?  It becomes pretty clear early on that this is a tale of shifting allegiances; why subject the viewers to a visual tennis match of emotion for nearly two hours if you're not going to deliver upon the premise by offering some moral to the story?  Was De Palma just doing what these women were doing and playing with our emotions?<br /><br />Well, if that's the case, I've got better things to do with my time, Brian.  You're all smoke and no mirrors.<br /><br />PASSION (2012) is produced by SBS Productions, Integral Film, France 2 Cinema, Canal+, and whole host of other contributors (you can check out the complete list over at IMDB.com).  DVD distribution is being handled by Entertainment One (aka E One).  As for the technical specifications, please!  This is a Brian De Palma film, so little expense was spared in bringing the best video and audio quality to work, and it shows.  As for the special features?  Well, there's a round robin of interviews with De Palma, McAdams, and Rapace, along with the theatrical trailer, but it's a surprisingly slim assortment for such a big production.<br /><br />RECOMMENDED.  Elegantly filmed but ultimately a bit empty, PASSION really only works on one level - visually.  The rest of it?  Well, it's surprisingly tame for something that sure looked like it was going to get all hot and bothered.  McAdams and Rapace perform capably though I thought the former was a poor choice for a femme fatale here - perhaps they should've swapped roles?  Come the end - the final scene dishes a big finish that might befuddle viewers even more - I still didn't much care for anyone in here; that loss of connection certainly didn't serve the picture well.<br /><br />In the interests of fairness, I'm pleased to disclose that the fine folks at Entertainment One (aka E One) provided me with a DVD copy of PASSION by request for the expressed purposes of completing this review.h the central villain?<br /><br />Maybe the intent here was to serve up a narrative twist - present two characters, establish their roles, and then make the audience do an about-face.  If so, then why take such an uncalculated gamble?  It becomes pretty clear early on that this is a tale of shifting allegiances; why subject the viewers to a visual tennis match of emotion for nearly two hours if you're not going to deliver upon the premise by offering some moral to the story?  Was De Palma just doing what these women were doing and playing with our emotions?<br /><br />Well, if that's the case, I've got better things to do with my time, Brian.  You're all smoke and no mirrors.<br /><br />PASSION (2012) is produced by SBS Productions, Integral Film, France 2 Cinema, Canal+, and whole host of other contributors (you can check out the complete list over at IMDB.com).  DVD distribution is being handled by Entertainment One (aka E One).  As for the technical specifications, please!  This is a Brian De Palma film, so little expense was spared in bringing the best video and audio quality to work, and it shows.  As for the special features?  Well, there's a round robin of interviews with De Palma, McAdams, and Rapace, along with the theatrical trailer, but it's a surprisingly slim assortment for such a big production.<br /><br />RECOMMENDED.  Elegantly filmed but ultimately a bit empty, PASSION really only works on one level - visually.  The rest of it?  Well, it's surprisingly tame for something that sure looked like it was going to get all hot and bothered.  McAdams and Rapace perform capably though I thought the former was a poor choice for a femme fatale here - perhaps they should've swapped roles?  Come the end - the final scene dishes a big finish that might befuddle viewers even more - I still didn't much care for anyone in here; that loss of connection certainly didn't serve the picture well.<br /><br />In the interests of fairness, I'm pleased to disclose that the fine folks at Entertainment One (aka E One) provided me with a DVD copy of PASSION by request for the expressed purposes of completing this review.
B000EHSN9Y|5.0|From older core 2 duo macbook to 24&#34; samsung 245bw display (1920 x 1200).  No issues, does what it needs to do.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|This was a sequel that I've been waiting for! Classic King, brought back the horror of The Shining from all of those years ago. I' m actually going to re-read The Shining.
B00E9P957Q|5.0|must have for any RUSH fan great albums that not alot of people have listened to. will enjoy for many years
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Fun stuff - can't stop playing once I start.  Kids of all ages will love this and play and play it.
B00FOWX6NM|3.0|I purchased this case so it could still fit inside of a wallet, but if dropped will protect my phone from scratches.  Not quite durable enough to absorb the shock of a drop to a hard floor surface, but definitely protects from daily wear and tear.  Enjoy!
B00AZMFK3K|5.0|Bought as a birthday gift and was well liked. Good fun and entertaining movie since the first Star Trek seems to have changed the entire future of Star Trek
B003O86FMW|5.0|Oh wow. This book was fabulous. Just like the first. I seemed to find myself more glued to this one though. I guess since I already knew what was gonna happen in the first one. But wow. It is phenomenal. So excited for book three.
B00005JGAF|4.0|It sounds great on my new turntable, Its the pioneers of Punk Rock!! What else can i say you are either a fan or you or not a fan!
B000WEMH3C|1.0|as others have described this is not durable. I live in CA and even here it lasted only 2 weeks before it tore. I had another one of those that lasted 2 years which is why I ignored the other reviews. Very likely that Weber changed production on this one to a less durable material.
B003WWZ148|5.0|The best of the best. Legend, pioneer people still use a reference, Elvis made bad movies, Cash made gold Nothing else needs to be said!
B0009FU0ZQ|5.0|As mentioned in the title above, Nice Dvd. It is like watching it on television. Nice menu and special features.
B0052T7IC2|4.0|It sounds great on my new turntable, Its the pioneers of Punk Rock!! What else can i say you are either a fan or you or not a fan!
B00BD99JMW|5.0|Great finish. Packed with action, emotion, and suspense. I'm not a big reader, but I couldn't put these books down.
B004JN1D2I|5.0|I have found it hard to find a book that would grab my attention and hold it.  This did it. I can't put it down. It has cost me many hours of sleep because before I knew it I only had a few hours before work.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|My son liked the book a lot, but finished it in a couple of days. Kind of expensive for what it is.
B000I186FW|5.0|Definitely one of the best movies out there! Watch it if you enjoy more complex and emotional movies! Amazing actors/actresses as well.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Fun. Addicting. Don't like when stuck they ask u to pay 99cents more. And hook up with friends on Facebook . I am not going there. Will find something else to do. Good game don 't like the gimmicks that have to put up with to play!!!!!!! If not a good game would give a I star!!!!!!
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|few bugs but i live this game. so when it messes up I restart it. and u should get more life's,or...maybe u can put the 30 minutes to 15minutes
B002ELM5HY|5.0|Love this CD....Mark has done it again.He has gone solo now and his music is very scottish and folksey.Love the words.
B000JQU4TW|5.0|This is a book that demonstrates just why you shouldn't make wishes and promises regarding ownership of your soul. Dorian does this after  a talk with a nasty character, and after some delay and short-lived romance with a woman, vaults headfirst into a sordid life of sin, in the process of which he takes great pleasure observing the portrait's change.<br /><br />PS: Ever notice how he's blonde in the book but most movies give him dark hair?
B008RA3X5E|1.0|It does NOT WORK !  very disappointing because l bought it to use on a recent<br />vacation and it did not work.
B000JQUKKU|5.0|It sure does accomplish a lot. The story is timeless, and redeems the most unredeemable of men, one miserly Ebenezer Scrooge.<br /><br />Time and time again I am amazed at how short it is. It's like a book by Terry Pratchett, in what it does with so few pages. You begin to think the book is a Tardis that is bigger on the inside.
0064400557|5.0|Great book for early readers.  I bought this for my kindergarten age son, and read it to him.  He can't read it - yet - but the story is easy for him to understand while still challenging his imagination.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|It was a entertaining book. It kept my interest throughout the book. I could have done without some of the scenes.
B00F87ZUYG|5.0|I love  the walking dead it is the greatest show on tv I look forward to it every Sunday! Can't wait!
B007P3S1AQ|4.0|Love love loved this movie OSKAR made me cry.  I loved his dialog. loved how the relationships helped him. The story as a whole so well crafted.
B0083SBMBM|5.0|To me, the movie started a little slow, maybe it was  just skepticism on my part, but then it started cooking! Joss Whedon has brought the Avengers together in a way that showcases each superhero's personality and talents while working together as a team. Well done!
B006LSZECO|5.0|A previous reviewer made mention of the saying \\"the mask, given time, comes to be the face itself\\".  However, in the context of this book, the two main characters knowingly maintain their charade and their knowledge of each other's real selves, fully aware that their marriage is one big masquerade.<br /><br />We, as readers, are strung along whichever story line Nick and Amy (the main characters) wish to divulge.  This is the main strength of Flynn's writing.  Because for each story line to feel solid, real and authentic, the writer would have had to plot out every single possible consequence, and retrofit it into the story and its timeline.  Flynn is a master of this, and makes her a scary person in real life (pun intended, meant as a credit to her attention to detail).<br /><br />This book makes me hate worldliness (which I define as \\"world, love me!\\") and how it permeates relationships.  This book makes me hate selfishness, and the desire to protect one's image, reputation, and stories, no matter the cost.<br /><br />On the other hand, this book makes me appreciate living a life of truth, a life that Christianity espouses, despite criticism from the more learned people.  A simple life, lived in truth, within means, with constant forgiveness and attempt to change, is more worthy of emulation, than any successful masquerade.<br /><br />Excellent writing - and subject matter for essays, debates, discussions, and book clubs.  Recommended for reflection, but make sure that you have a good grip of your own convictions as a person.  Proceed with caution.
B005LAIGOQ|5.0|The Woman in Black is a spooky old fashioned Gothic ghost story where faces and footprints appear from nowhere. The creepy old house has a tainted, tragic past. The property has grave sites and it is surrounded by marsh land that is flooded by the tide each day which makes it even more eerie. The villagers don't want anything to do with it or the vengeful woman in black who continues to seek revenge even after her death. Daniel Radcliffe does a fine job in this role as do the other actors.
B00BAXFECK|5.0|Best book I've read in 20 years. It. Is destined to be a classic. Engaging. Profound. Inspiring. A \\"must read\\".
B000XUBFE2|5.0|Where are the stories of our lives heading when there is a death? How do we go on? Who impacts our very being?
B009ME47H2|5.0|At first I had trouble playing on my Kindle Fire as it gave me an error on playing that format (.wav) - but it does play w/ app player. Volume for playback on the Fire is not very loud, but I have external speakers.  I LOVE that I can easily send audio recordings to my computer via Email, Box or Dropbox so don't need to use my Kindle's limited storage space. I only did a couple brief things,  so I'm not sure how big a file it would create for a meeting or the like.  File size you can email is limited (email limitation, not program limitation),  but I think Box can handle up to 100MB,  way more than the Fire could hold! Sure wish I had this for a class I took a couple weeks ago.<br /><br />Was going to subtract a star for low volume playback,  but then discovered that it would actually run in the background while I was jotting notes on my Color Note app (or probably any other note taking app).  If you kept track of what time you started recording, this would let you add notes keeping track of different parts of the recording you might most want to review if it was a class. Now I'm even MORE disappointed I didn't have it for my recent class.<br /><br />Final test ... do I need to be right on top of it to get a decent recording?  NO! Yet another surprise. Walked to the other side of the room while speaking and noticed no appreciable drop in sound quality! Super handy.  I like it!
B00E7SID9G|5.0|Wonderful,insightful companion to a trip to Jordan and Jerusalem. Clearly illustrated the differences between Old Testament Jesus, radical and anti the corrupt clerical hierarchy , Judea centric Jew, as opposed to Paul's anti Jewish, world socialist, love thy neighbor Christian of the New Testament.
B00881VLCE|5.0|I'm hooked on this game. If you like puzzles you will love this one, it's very easy. Pictures are very colourful.
B005CAPS0K|4.0|It was good, interesting. It was a thriller but it wasn't scary. It was worth watching, worth renting, I wouldn't buy it.
B00AEFY5MK|5.0|Brings me back 20 years lol.. One of my favorite movies.. Just introduced it to my daughter, and she loves it...
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Candy Crush is not for the easily intimidated. One has to be quick with thoughts and follow up actions. It can be exasperating, but that is a part of the appeal. Have been stuck on locale thirty for two days. Hopefully I will find a way out tonight. A solitary, but very challenging game.
0316548189|5.0|Book well-written. Very authentic, and really gives a good picture. I enjoyed reading it. It was also delivered promptly.<br />I felt like I was reading about the biblical Moses. Thank you, Mandela!
B005LY4B0A|5.0|Puzzles start easy enough to figure out how it works, then get pretty challenging pretty quick.  You have to cut the spider off from the bugs, but it makes a beeline for spots that give it access to multiple bugs so you can only save one.  It says you can only have one hint per hour (I haven't used it yet), but most things unlock based on the number of stars, so you can skip an occasional level.  I'm not much more than &frac14; through the game, and I've been stumped more than once, but it makes finally solving it all the sweeter!
0374531269|5.0|I appreciated that the account was written and narrated by a boy with first-hand experience (I listened to the audible version).  He explains his fear and struggle for survival from his own experiences and you begin to understand, reluctantly, how an innocent child with such a big heart could perform such atrocities.  You also learn that these tainted children, at least some of them, have the capacity for rehabilitation and the ability to attain happiness after such horrible experiences full of hatred and violence.  His story makes you question humanity, but his survival and recovery will return hope and faith of the good in this world.  This book makes you want to become an activist for the plight of these children and their families.
B00003CX8Y|5.0|We love the classic Disney Movies and this is one that is always fabulous for all audiences through the decades!
B00340I4KG|5.0|I really enjoyed watching Face/off. I always watching when it broadcast on TV. Now since it's on amazon prime, I can watch it anytime.
B00CZ1TMUQ|5.0|Jonathan and Charlotte are amazing singers. Jonathan is a future opera star. Everyone, please buy this CD if you enjoy listening to good music and singing.
B000GCFG7E|4.0|All the familiar pieces of a Jack Reacher novel are here. Jack's &#34;random&#34; connection to the start of the story, his uncanny sense of the exact time, his ability to think things all the way through to figure out what to do next. He also finds a beautiful companion to help him, too. The plot twists several times, keeping the reader engaged and curious. It is satisfying to know that Jack can still take on several people at once, shoot accurately, and honor the good guys.
B00DWFQ2N4|5.0|I read other reviews before purchasing this album but I decided id let my ears be the judge. Quite honestly i really enjoyed the album<br />JT took it to another level, though i miss the simpler songs it still has a good groove.
B00G9U7R2O|5.0|What a great addition to the franchise. This movie was a great prequel and just so much fun for the entire family!!
B007TK77QE|2.0|Disappointing, even though it is a quite well written novel. Good for people, like me, who want to improve their English. The language is very rich and elegant.
B0074VTHKM|3.0|It is not at the level of John Grisham's other books. John Grisham could do much better and does in his other books.
1577656865|5.0|I am a middle school teacher.  This book is awesome for middle school.  Very worthwhile.  Shows the creature's point of view. It is a pleasure to teach.
B005LAJ22Q|5.0|The shipment received in proper order and very timely. I love the show and have watched several times already. Have also shared with family and friends.
B008JFUPOY|5.0|This is an awesome movie along with the great price. Pre-ordering and getting them as soon as they come out is also awesome.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|So glad Candy Crush Finally became available for Kindle . . . I've been waiting for a very long time for this . . . Thanks Amazon and King
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Wonderful game for passing the time, then the next thing you know you've been playing for hours. I love this game
B000FBFN1U|5.0|Wonderful book. George Martin is an amazing tail weaver. The way that all the character interact and their viewpoints make for an amazing tail.
B00D5RJTQ6|5.0|This CD is fun and ridiculous.  I personally use this CD for working out because it is uplifting and hard.  If you are looking for escape the fate, go buy one of their old CDs.  If you are looking for FIR, then this should be right down your alley.
B004CLYKLI|4.0|I liked that it was very honest not leaving out even the most embarrassing moments, like for example the fights she had with her daughters and her husband. I would recommend this book to anyone, it was funny and also a good story of families. For a parent looking to gain insight on different styles of parenting, they will learn a lot from this book. I am not a patent but it made me think about my own growing up, I sincerely wish my parents would have pushed me more. It also made me think about the way I want to raise my kids one day. What I gained from this book was a very valuable lesson, I can continue to parent myself and push myself to be the person I want to be and to accomplish the goals I want to accomplish with the same fierce tenacity of a tiger mom. Thanks Amy.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|What an enjoyable read!  The story itself was intriguing, the narration superb. I delighted in this book from cover to cover!
1451695195|5.0|although it near death experience while in a coma very well and intrestingly, it does not cover awake out of body experience, so i still have not found anyone who has experienced it as well !
B00BQ1D91E|5.0|Not only is the vinyl edition of Infestissumam a throwback to when buying albums gave you large cover art, and lyrics you could actually read...but this baby is pressed on red vinyl. Excellent artwork and typography all around...Ghost made sure this was done right! Then, you get to the music....just a blast to listen to. Reminiscent of 70s Sabbath and Blue Oyster Cult. This is an amazing band, both musically and visually. Ghost is the real deal.
B00B3N4CWK|1.0|Thought it was going to be a nice movie. Had to turn it off part way through:( Wouldn't watch again.
B0051HNMTI|4.0|I like that you can choose 5, 10 min workouts, and doing 1 exercise for a minute means you don't have to count reps, and I feel the burn, i like it, i am using it daily!
B00C1BHQXK|5.0|Even though a title seems a little bit misleading, the book is a great actionable advice on how to focus on what is important at the moment and get it done efficiently. Easy and inspiring read.
140006922X|5.0|A fantastic look into the world and culture into which Jesus was born( In Nazareth it turns out!).Gave me a whole different view of what his life was actually like, what his sense of mission was, and how his legend was carefully created in the decades after his death. A must for anyone who has any interest in Jesus beyond the church approved version. And not written from a nonbeliever viewpoint.
0061950726|5.0|Interesting from a historical perspective, and a delightful read. Love the way the main characters were developed. Would definitely recommend it for a book club discussion group.
B000JIHP88|4.0|I bought this for my newborn niece. It was easy to assemble, although it goes only on cribs with rails. If your crib/playpen has netting or fabric walls, you can't use this.<br /><br />Volume seemed a little low though. Otherwise it works well and amuses both adults and baby.
B00DXP0QX0|4.0|Liked very much . It was good to hear different versions and different cuts. All they seem to play on the radio is Maggie .
B00EL8I8IS|3.0|This was OK, but it does not even touch 28 days later or 28 weeks later or the walking dead.  I recommend this just on pure entertainment but it's not worth seeing more than one or two times.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|The puzzles are challengeing and the graphics are very well done. The game kept my interest to the very end, I did not want to put it down. Would love to have more puzzles because it went by so fast. That is the only complaint I have.
B004XUMMFE|5.0|I started watching this series after seeing Serenity.  Serenity was an awesome movie and I wanted to see if the series was like the movie it produced.  The series is great.  Great episodes with a great cast (same as the movie) and lots of science-fiction which I love.  I really cannot understand why it wasn't renewed after one season.  This is by far one of my favorite series of all time.
B0049J0CTM|5.0|Considering my 3 yr old watched this movie 3 times within a 3 day rental of it- I'd say it's a good movie. She never got scared with this one either like she usually does with the Princess movies- the villains are not her favorite.
B00FEN000S|4.0|It was a very entertaining movie.  Some of the acting, not so great, but the action and special effects makes up for it.  I would recommend this to a sci-fi buff totally.
B00BD99JMW|1.0|I loved loved loved Divergent, and though Insurgent was just fine, but held out hope that it was all a setup for a great third. I was so wrong, what a terrible ending! I would advocate for people to just stop reading after the first book, or just not start the series.
B00AKEMHCA|5.0|This game is great because it is way better than the other bloon Tower Defences. Also it is so worth the money.
B008Q08IV4|4.0|Was a good plot and well set in theme, one could almost predict what was coming. would watch again, well played out...
B00F36ZHHC|1.0|This app is the worst app I have ever seen.  It is a piece of trash.  It half downloaded, and if you want to buy the $265 dollar app it keep trying to sell, I guess you could, then you could have a $260 piece of trash as well.  It has messed up my kindle, resetting doest work and of course you can't delete it.  download at your own risk.  Wish I had never seen it.
B000QRIGLC|5.0|By far one of the best books I have read in a long time.  Very well written and the story keeps you on the edge of your seat the whole time.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|I really love this game but it keeps freezing and sometimes it gives my tokens and other stuff back and then sometimes it will not i want to keep playing but if it keeps freezing then most likely i will stop playing please fix it i dont want to stop playing it i have done come so far
B004GHNIRK|5.0|Many thanks Amazon for bringing us these classics for free.<br />It is always a pleasure reading them, and it is so convenient in my kindle.
B003G4W49C|5.0|Orson Scott card was able to create a world in which the reader actually feels what is going on. It is rich with detail and sets up a story that will lead to many other stories, each complete and yet opening up possibilities for additional worlds. A very satisfying read. I look forward to seeing what the filmmakers do with this story.
B004UJAYEY|5.0|Many thanks Amazon for bringing us these classics for free.<br />It is always a pleasure reading them, and it is so convenient in my kindle.
B004IK8PLE|5.0|I enjoyed this book because it combines History, Math and Politics in a very interesting way.  I never thought about Cryptography's significance in this manner, so this book revealed some great insights to me.  The stories and incidents sprinkled throughout the book make it a very interesting read.
0307476073|5.0|You can't not relate to Cheryl. She has written a book of her experiences going through something we all go through; a personal and turbulent time in her life. It is heart breaking and uplifting and hilarious and has you scratching your head and calling her an idiot and all the while you know you can relate. You've been there and that is what makes this book great.
B00B7I8HZ4|4.0|I bought this tiny PC to use as a HD home theater PC (DVR). Initially, I tried it with just a small<br />USB thumb drive running OpenElec XBMC. It worked great the first time out, but I wasn't happy<br />with the TV recording integration -- even with a compatible MediaPortal back-end.<br /><br />I added the 64GB mSATA [[ASIN:B00B5BRISK Lite On Plextor M5M PX-64M5M 64GB mSATA Solid State Drive]]<br />and installed Windows7 with Windows Media Center.<br />In addition, I added an external USB hard disk to hold the recorded TV programs. To provide the TV<br />signal, I have a SiliconDust HD HomeRun Prime with 3 tuners. This device uses a cable card to decode<br />the standard and high-def channels, which WMC easily locates on our 1Gb LAN.<br /><br />I am really pleased with the NUC for this purpose. It uses both CPU cores, but never gets hot.<br />I have used to to record two programs while watching a third. It isn't limited by the CPU at all.<br />However, the external USB2 seems to be a bottleneck when trying to watch a recorded program while<br />another show is also writing the disk. If the NUC had come with USB3, I'd give it 5 stars.<br />I know there are never models with the Core i5 CPU and USB3, but that NUC was much pricier.<br />Overall, the value and performance of this unit serves my purposes very well.
0307352153|5.0|If you haven't watched Susan Cain's TED talk, I suggest you do. Especially if you don't want to read the book or even as a summary or idea of what she goes into in depth in the book. Her writing is friendly and draws you in. Even if you are an extrovert, she makes you see the sides of you that could be considered introverted. There's also a part on a couple that my husband and I identified with; the husband is outgoing and loves to have people over but the wife is more quiet and enjoys smaller groups. There is a compromise and you begin to see that there is value in both kinds of people. Very interesting read, I enjoyed this book immensely. Remember though, this is not fact and it is a cultural assessment. Very little quantitative data has been collected. It gives you some things to think about.
B00BIRRDZ4|3.0|I really like &#34;From A Window Seat&#34;. which is why I purchased the album.  The rest of the album, however, is not quite so good.  t is very Jackson Browne like, both in sound and in tempo.  It is good, but not great.
B00B89LZ4C|5.0|I love it. The blister wasn't in perfect shape but the figure had no problem and it's a great piece. Remember it's a collectible, not an action figure.
B0084TWN9K|1.0|I got through the first 2 stories and had to quit.  The setting dreary, the feeling depressing.  I was not able to picture in my mind what the author was saying (to be able to do so is a mark of a great author to me ie: Leon Uris).  Long ago I remember reading Andersonville and I could see the prison conditions.  I don't recommend this unless you need to be more depressed.  Noble prize for this??? What were they thinking?
B002LC8HF0|5.0|best of the three books in the series. very good ending wit a lot of tie ins and surprises.<br /><br />word
1586638491|5.0|This book is required reading for my son's eight grade class.  He and I have been reading the assigned reading assignments together. Through this book, I am learning to appreciate Shakespeare as has my son.
B008MM9630|3.0|This game is easy and fun. However it does take along time to complete tasks and earn money. Also food doesn't wait. If you Do not pick it when it is done it will spoil. Then you have to use up your energy.
B00DVKOYBM|4.0|Very representative of live 8 ball. Really helps with seeing shot angles. Some folks don't like to stick around and rematch if you beat them but that's on them.
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|Pros:<br />-the awesome price<br />-easy to use<br /><br />Cons:<br />-You need pretty good wi-fi in order to maintain acceptable viewing quality<br />-can stream YouTube and chrome web pages but nothing else<br /><br />Thoughts:<br />- My audio was a bit weird
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|I love Jurassic park so when I downloaded the game I was hoping it would be something I liked. I figured if I didn't like it ,it wouldn't be too bad because it was free to download and therefore I wasn't losing any money. I actually really got into the game.

B001ACH4DS|5.0|Love David Cook's voice.  Loved how he changed up songs on American Idol.  Him being on idol made me want to watch and see what he would do with each song.  I love this cd find it soothing and enjoyable to listen to.

B004WOS3P4|5.0|I really am enjoying this.  I loved David Cook's first cd and am really liking this one.  His voice is so unique.  If you like David Cook this cd will not disappoint. Enjoy

030789701X|5.0|I adore this product. It contains nearly every shred of information that one could possibly need to know, not just for the main game, but for all three expansions. With over 1100 pages of very high quality paper, this book will aid you throughout your gaming experience. I've yet to fully delve into the eGuide that  you get the code for, though I have heard solid things about it  as wll. The only negative part of this guide is the cover. It's decent in quality, though not only could the durability be better, but the design could have had more effort put into it. It is attractive, with the classic smokey design with most Skyrim products, though is not raised or indented whatsoever. Nonetheless,  I would reccomend this product.

B00FWLDHSY|3.0|Taken at face value, and without much expectation, this move was enjoyable.  In the vein of old classic larger than life mega-monster battle movies like Godzilla, It's a fun ride.  It's CGI special effects are really well done, which is a good thing, because they help the viewer totally not care that the plot is such a joke.  The main character played by Charlie Hunnam may as well have been played by almost anyone, however he did well-enough with what he had to work with.<br /><br />I would recommend this movie as a solid rental choice when you feel like being entertained by some well-paced action for 2 hours.  However, I would only recommend this for purchase by fans of the monster-battle genre.

B00867GHS8|4.0|I got this for my kids and it's a great family movie.  3d gimmick is ok, but the digital copy is good for iTunes.  so you can put it on your kids ipad and they will be happy (for at least the length of the movie).
B002LFPAUC|5.0|British humor is wonderful. Starting with Monty Python, John Cleese may be one of the most impactful comedian in the genre. Faulty Towers is &#34;roll on the floor&#34; funny. The qualtiy of the disks is fine. These shows are a lot of fun!
B00F8MI9NK|4.0|This was an amazing movie! My son and I both love it. Great story and message. The only problem, I bought the digital copy. It has all I the special feature that the disc would, but 90% of the features have no sound! Not sure if this is normal for a digital purchase, but I won't be doing it again.
B005GSZZ1A|5.0|Escape From Camp 14<br /><br />It was very interesting how a person born and brought up with no ethical training in an abusive prison could make adjustments to the real world. Shin had and has a difficult time with this. Excellent read
B00007J5VN|4.0|Great movie.  Fosse did a great job his first time out as director.  Shirley was perfect in the role.  And Sammy Davis Jr is absolutely brilliant.  Love love love this movie.
B005413UZ2|5.0|If you're a fan of Spiritualized, you already know that this is probably the biggest selling record by them.  It's heart breakingly beautiful.  A MUST HAVE for fans of 90s brit pop of fans of beautiful music altogether.
B0083ZRAJS|4.0|Nice little bit of reading, just as enjoyable as the movie I grew up with.  I'll be reading this to my daughter when she gets older.
B0036S4B6M|3.0|Fairly well written book....quick and entertaining read.  I have to admit it was a spur of the moment purchase.  Entertaining TV series.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I am so glad this is now in kindle.  Wish you could earn items instead of having to purchase.  But, really enjoy playing the game.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Absolutely love it. We are watching it for the 3rd time. Can't wait for Season 4. I highly recommend it.
B00AZMFK3K|5.0|Just when I thought Star Trek couldn't get any better...IT BLOWS MY MIND! Best addition to the series yet not just for special effect but for story line but for the development of the whole new cast!
B005ZB91KY|4.0|I have watched this movie many times prior to this last viewing. When I am tired and might fall asleep. I will put on a movie that I have seen before and enjoyed. My reasoning, if I dose off and wake up it is no big deal. If I have a movie on that I have not seen before, I would be upset if I fell asleep. I would recommend this movie to those who have not watched it before. Very entertaining.
B00E978FGQ|4.0|Just love it. I bought this movie pretty much right after I watched it in the movie theater, because I simply wanted to add it to my personal movie collection.
B008P1EWIM|5.0|I love it vary much. its awsome. it works like charm. I don't think I can live without it. best app for the money.
B001D7CHAA|5.0|Excellent and thorough work. It has changed my daily practice pretty dramatically. The material is certainly beyond 101 but not too complex to understand. I may even be buying a physical copy for my bookshelf.
B009YN2M7S|5.0|This was the 1st book I read authored by Nicolas Sparks.  WOW - it was great.  I could hardly put my Kindle down.  The story was interesting and believable.  I am renting the movie next.
1616551631|5.0|Artbook is great! It was a gift for my sister. And she is very happy, she got it as a birthday present
B00E8KLWB4|3.0|Good layout but a bit overdone. Tutorials could cover more details of transcriptions. On balance a worthwhile game. Great drawings.

B00CH26TL8|4.0|I have definitely loved great games. They have always said that sometimes the best things in life are free, and I have definitely enjoyed Bubble Witch Saga. This game definitely brings out the spooky in bubble games. This is definitely one of those games that remains simple and fun to play as you explore so many levels trying to clear. The game plays just like other great puzzle popping games like Bubble Bobble as you try and clear rows and connections of bubble by sending them in through the top of the walls, as you set three in a row to drop into the vats of brew. The game is fun and absolutely addictive just as much if you have played Candy Crush Saga and Pet Rescue Saga. This is definitely a great guilty pleasure to play for your kindle fire.<br /><br />Graphics: B+<br /><br />Control: A-<br /><br />Fun & Enjoyment: A-<br /><br />Overall: B+

B001NLL93W|5.0|This book was the best one so far. And that's saying a lot considering how good the others were. This one had the saddest and happiest moments I've experienced from the series so far and I can't wait to read book 4.
B0025KVLSI|5.0|Great band What else can I say? This is a great purchase a one of a kind cd from a unique band, this is more than awesome.

0525953728|5.0|This book was a long read, but was well broken up. It details the life of a Navy Seal, not just the hunt for UBL. Great look into all the training and reality that war brings on a special forces individual.

B00FEJIVRQ|5.0|I did not realize I was purchasing a digital copy only...very disappointed that I will not receive the actual DVD. Unfortunately I am not able to watch the movie, it pauses often and reloads tells me there is an error and restarts.

0307719774|5.0|This is such a great journal. It askes a question every day and allows you reflect and elaborate on the question. I bought one for myself and then for friends as gifts because I liked it so much.

B0028R3NCU|5.0|I have been very happy with the Kingston adapter.  Has been more reliable than others so far.  Physical specifications on this devices seem to be better than other adapters I have tried.  Slips very easily into any USB port I have tried.  The interface for the Micro SD card also is very solid with no fear of the card slipping out of the adapter.  Has worked in any device PC, Blu-Ray player etc that I have tried.
B0094BB4TW|3.0|I'm giving it a 3 just because I like Facebook but I wasn't able to download the free app.so I can't really judge the app.just judging the source.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|the community is great!  always willing to help &  share. I  do have problems getting all of my gifts on my phone,  but if I log on through the computer, they show up.
B008QTV3X0|5.0|Excellent show! Watched the first two and now am hooked.  Love the main characters and the fact that one is dealing with mental health issues but is highly functional......on meds, of course.
B00C5R7F8G|5.0|Very interesting history of the US's nuclear weapons program.  Packed full of factoids, and interwoven with a cold war thriller level story of one particular incident, you come away just shaking your head.  How did we survive the cold war without one of these things going off?  If you lived through &#34;duck and cover&#34; you don't want to miss this one.
B00FI7XBIS|5.0|A little easy but entertaining if you are bored and have nothing else to do. Only writing this review to get a bonus level
B00136JR2M|5.0|You cannot be a rap fan without this classic album in your collection. Wu tang put you in the streets of shaolin SI in each an every song.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|I have read most of Stephen King 's books and this is definitely one of my favorites.  Great fast paced read!
B00BSB2AE4|4.0|I think my title summed it up but I love to read Allie's blog and I'm glad to support her book. She had such a unique visual style and her illustrations serve the story so well.<br /><br />Also get stuff is hilarious. Read this. You'll be glad you did.
B00F35B8F8|4.0|The fact that they started on an alien planet exploring and attempting to help the natives out of a jam is what did it for me.  Brought back some of the old ST memories from previous generations.  Benedict Cumberbatch's portrayal of Khan is certainly among the highest of ST villains.  Rest of the cast was terrific but a certain moment towards the end that should have had me feeling angry just brought laughter.  I appreciated the reference but it didn't invoke the reaction that the filmmakers probably intended.  Overall, very good movie and one of the best since First Contact.
B008Y1YK9Y|5.0|I purchased for a Christmas gift. She wanted the set so I purchased the entire series for her. Perfect gift.
B00B935SUY|5.0|This movie takes you on a journey not just through an era of music that we will never see or here again, but also you see an amazing recording studio and how it was the last stand before Pro Tools took over. Then Dave Grohl came in and brought it back to life. Amazing story and interviews. Flawless
0307887960|5.0|I followed someone else's advice to buy it used here and it was more than 1/2 the price of a new one, and excellent shape (even though it was rated very good).  I have already recommended this book from this site to a co-worker.<br /><br />Thank you....and the diet is working!!
B009EHDU7U|1.0|This book was totally 'groan material' but I persevered as had to read it for Book Club.  Sorry, it did not appeal to my sense of humour. It was clever in the end when they were exonerated but not a good read.
B00F30S0Y0|1.0|I am very dissapointed in this album.  Funeral was a good album and The Suburbs was phenomenal.  However, with Reflektor, Arcade Fire seem to have lost the emotion and well written lyrics that made previous efforts so strong.  On Reflektor, the band sounds like they are trying too hard.  Trying too hard to be experimental.  Trying too hard to be artful, hip and thoughtful.  Trying too hard to avoid producing the Suburbs Part II.  The whole album feels hallow, emotionless and over produced - in the end, it's pretentious and annoying.  Hopefully they can regain what made them good in the first place on the next album.  Safe to say this one won't last a full week in my rotation.
B00FRQ32N4|5.0|This game is amazing. I like it because it lets u buy any robot u want u can pick the color of your choice and u can also upgrade ur robot and that is all I have to say.
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|Well Peter Jackson has shown us that when given the chance. That he will deliver a well crafted movie, that people will enjoy.
B00821OX98|5.0|This is a great show and my family is really enjoying watching it unfold. Thank you for providing it with Amazon Prime
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I love this program. It is the best new thing that public television has come out with in a very long time. I am always looking forward to the new season.
B000VSAEYI|4.0|Our two year old had a lot of fun playing in this pool and we look forward to using it again next summer.  The only reason I gave it four stars instead of five is that the valve for the sprinklers doesn't really work and so you have to do all the fine tuning with the hose faucet which can be a little inconvenient if it isn't near your pool.
0393057658|4.0|I fell in love with the story on the Movie Moneyball, since i´m Sports Journalist here in Brazil i decided to learn more about this whole event, and make me more aware what is happin here as well on the Football(soccer) market.
B0000256VK|4.0|This is a great CD by Bryan Ferry and Co.  There are many familiar great songs on it that were missing from my collection.
B007EECSFA|4.0|The first part was a little hard to get into, but the rest moved rapidly. I was surprised and pleased by the ending.
B00BSB2AE4|5.0|I made the mistake of having this book sent to my work address. The secretary opening the mail enjoyed a chapter before passing it on to me. Be warned: it is not possible to read this book cover to cover, you may damage yourself trying! Fortunately, it is published in full color, so when the background color of the page changes, that is your visual cue to stop reading and go massage all the muscles you sprained while laughing. Also, don't leave the book lying around where others can see it. It will wander off, and may not come back very quickly. I highly recommend writing your name inside the cover as soon as you get the book. Also, a microchip for tracking my not be a bad idea.
B006LSZECO|5.0|This was one book that I simply could not put down! I was intrigued by getting both sides of the story in an. Interesting way.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Chromecast streaming media player makes it so simple to access movies & video clips.  Installation took about 90 seconds.  Love it.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|I have never had a book make me cry ever till Me Before You. Great book club book. Loved it !
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I'm addicted and my eight year old and five year old loves playing it too. A great problem solving, pattern play, and just a yummy fun game for my kids to enjoy! There are many games like it but none as quite as fun. No purchases are necessary as you will earn Things from the start if you get three stars on the first 10 levels even if you don't connect on Facebook. I hope you will download on your android, kindle, and iPhone. Oh, also check out Lalaloopsy version too. My little girl loves it. Not sure if it's by the same company, but it's the only one that's just as fun for the little ones.
B00992CF6W|4.0|I would recommend this item to others. I was very pleased with my purchase. I really liked this item for myself.
B0064MGU98|5.0|Its an excellent show .  It gives you a glimpse of life behind the working mom with challenges in the home
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I can not stop playing this game. I love the challenges and variety between the levels. Only complaint us having to wait for tickets from friends! I am very satisfied.
B004X6PRO6|4.0|The book is written in the First Person, BUT the First Person keeps changing, thus making it hard to follow the story line.  Knowing little about N. Korea I wanted to read this book in our book club.  It will be interesting to hear from others re: this book of fiction, IF it is fiction.  If not it paints a pretty dreadful picture of the country.
B00FEPQ212|4.0|Beyond Birkie Fever is an adventurous journey of author, Walter Rhein in America's greatest cross-country ski race called American Birkebeiner. He shares with his readers how his journey as a skier changed since a kid of 7 years till date with details explaining his experiences beyond anything that one would ever hope to imagine!<br /><br />When you start with the book, you find founder David Landgraf's account of the first Birkie. I would say it's a good idea to start a book like this. It's like giving a cricket lover, a book written on Cricket starting with the interview of Sachin Tendulkar. A straight six by the author on the first ball itself! Those who have been involved with ski races will surely appreciate it.<br /><br />I found language used at the start of the book a little tough. Maybe, I felt so as being an Indian, I don't use words used by the author here in my daily talks. But, as you move with the flow, you find it to go smooth. Incidence one after another of the author's life keeps you moving with the flow of the book. Narration by the author is brilliant and would make you imagine yourself drown in the story. I belong to a country where there is not much snow. Still, I could imagine the plot very well. The part where author mentioned about his grandfather is really humorous. I didn't expect such a good end from the author after few setbacks with his health. Though, he fully convinced me with the end of the book.<br /><br />There are two drawbacks I found with this book. First, editing part could be taken better care of. Second, if the author wants to trap markets like India, he must reduce the price of the book.<br /><br />At the end, I must say, it was a refreshing read for me as I have been continuously reading Indian plots. The author was tremendous in taking me to a different world.<br /><br />On a personal note, I would like to thank Walter Rhein for choosing me to read this book. His next book, 'The Reader of Acheron' is soon going to hit the market. I wish the author, all the best for his next book and other future endeavors. :)arket. I wish the author, all the best for his next book and other future endeavors. :)
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Great show.  Always looked forward to the next chapter.<br />Good story.  Great actors.  I do love English shows.<br />Sorry that I a finished it.
B00FPH6AXE|4.0|Thankfully, I believe no one will get up the anger or care enough to punch me in the face for what I'm about to write. M's movies, as I have digested them, are not as they appear to be. Please bear with me on this, and forgive the seemingly banal statement. His recent effort, a story about a boy's trials, felt to me to be about the deeper struggle of maintaining the connection between a boy and his father. The Movie's trappings were incidental. The storyline is not new, but M. brought to the fore what easily happens in many relationships of this nature. I can attest to this. My father and I never talked about anything meaningful. I grew up without any skills to handle the world I live in, but I did not blame him. He himself grew up without a father. I did finally learn the importance of imparting needed skills to cope with this world. My son is autistic, and he always wants to be with me. I fear the future sometimes because eventually he will have to go into this world and make his way.<br />What I did like was at the most crucial point in this boy's life, his father was right there with him. He could not fight for his son, but he could prepare him, warn him and support him. In this particular story, the father himself is severely wounded, but he was still there, which is another way of saying that despite one's shortcomings and inadequacies, a father can still be of great benefit in the long run. You say I'm reaching? That may be. One mustn't metaphor a movie to greatness, or beat it over the head with them, but that is my take on M's latest accomplishment. There is no such thing as a perfect piece of cinematic fare, and I may not put this movie in my library, but I would see it again, with my son on our next time together. I had to preview the movie to make sure that my son could handle it. I am a bookworm, but I did appreciate the movie's attempt to strike a chord with it's audience.
0061537969|3.0|I thought this book was just OK.  The constant references to car racing might have been interesting if I was into NASCAR, but for me, it was too much.  That being said, it was a very readable book, and cute being from a dog's perspective.
B00AB7HESI|1.0|The core game is still there and if that is all you want then this will work for you. But if you're a fan of any of the DS versions and the little extras, then you will be disappointed. Most of the extras are behind $0.99 cent microtransactions. This was a little to much for me.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I couldn't put this book down, it was fantastic. It was so well written and I could imagine every aspect of the story at every point, like a vivid movie in my head. Definitely recommend.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|This is easily one of the best new Stephen King books I've read in years. I can't count how many times I've read the Shining in my life so getting to go back and revisit Danny was some fantastic nostalgia. While the very first part of the book was a bit challenging to read due to the subject matter, the tone changed quickly and the rest of the story easily had my attention glued until I ran out of pages.
B004Z7AHZC|5.0|love the movie .My kids love the whole diary of a wimpy kid series. My older one who's 8 enjoy reading Dairy of a Wimpy Kid books.
0143113100|4.0|I had to read this book for class. It is very different from anything that I've ever read, as it proposes all these possible therapies for different mental disorders that i'm sure people haven't thought of only because it's not 'the norm'. I definitely recommend this book. I learned a lot about the role of brain plasticity and the window period to make full recoveries from different debilitating illnesses.
B0035G5IOE|5.0|This is a great family movie. We love watching it together. and also a great buy. I bought it when it was on sale.
B0000062Y2|5.0|My husband makes a point of watching Jesus Christ Superstar every year around Easter time. My daughter usually joins him. They love the songs and the story, so getting this soundtrack for them was a no-brainer. This way they can enjoy the movie all year round!
B00EVW0VTI|5.0|Excellent movie. It explains much of the treason like attitudes of the Republican party today although I dont tyhink they would go that far but you never know given thier hate for the POTUS
0553386794|5.0|My husband and I watch Game of Thrones, and this book is a really good companion to read for the series. I didn't read it, but my husband did. And afterward, he promptly asked for the next two books of the series.
B0076I624W|4.0|I am very thankful that I found this as  this movie is one of my wife's all time favorite movies, and she loves it.
B00F8MIIKO|5.0|lot of fun . My children have watched it about 3 times already. highly recommended. especially the &#34;no pain, no gain part&#34;.You have to work hard to be a &#34;good monster&#34;
B00ARF93AQ|5.0|Excellent product. I like.<br />The video is excellent.<br />Good sound quality.<br />I recommend it to all my friends.<br />Thanks amazon for their service.
B00846TRHY|3.0|This was a good movie except for a couple of things.  The overuse of the &#34;F&#34; word and the sexual scenes were unnecessary.  I understand he had a hard life but that point could have been made without those things.  I would have also like to have seen this movie as coming from a more godly viewpoint.  Maybe expound on his vision and what caused him to make such a drastic change toward God.
B0094K1PW4|4.0|Excellent product. I like.<br />The video is excellent.<br />Good sound quality.<br />I recommend it to all my friends.<br />Thanks amazon for their service.
B008HK3XKO|5.0|I  bought this for my husband's Kindle Fire HD7.  He loves it.  It is just right for a man - black, nice finish, looks expensive!
B000FC12C8|5.0|So far I am half way through this book.  I find that it is a little difficult to read, due to the fact it was originally written in 1939.  It was revised by Ben Grahm in '71, or at least everything he refers to is around that time frame and earlier.  The best part are the commentaries at the end of each chapter.  They explain everything much better.  So far I have learned a lot.  I would recommend this book to anyone who wants a little more than the returns produced by a current day savings account.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|I like to see the birds flying and the small ones that turns into tree when you touch them its fun and enjoyable
B0093Q8W0C|5.0|One of my favorite movies ever.  Hitchcock was a master, Cary Grant was suave as always and Eva Marie Saint was quite beautiful.  The extra little touches Hitchcock always added make it really fun.
B00AGOGOLE|5.0|This is awesome for videos!<br />1 problem, it is hard to move the things you want for the videos. But overall this is great!
B000GOWNPU|3.0|Don't even remember watching this. I don't have a clue what this was about.I hope it was a free Prime movie.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I love brain teasers,and this one is great. Not to hard,not to easy. Just right<br />Levels are pretty well orchestrated to keep your interest.
B003G4W49C|5.0|This is the kind of book that you can only truly understand the more carefully you read it. There Is a lot of symbolism, so think hardly.
B0081KZ20E|5.0|I have read this book in spanish and in italian, I liked better the spanish translation, than I decided that I have to resd it in english.<br />I like very much the Forsyth way of whriting, I like the way that he handle the historical facts with the novel fiction.<br />I recomend  all the Forsyth books to all who likes action, suspence and a very sincere social and political conflicts.
B000JPRPAO|4.0|A good action thriller, with twists.<br />This is one of only a select few that I would watch again.<br />You will enjoy!
B007HACDLK|5.0|This is how I would classify this book. well written, makes great reading. Kept going at it from start to finish. A high level of  &#34; machoman &#34; content. Nevertheless: pleasant, riveting reading.
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|Great app! Wish it would adjust times automatically when I travel so I wouldn't have to do it in my head! Lots of nice features.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|Fun to play easy to get stuck in but frustrating waiting for coins at times. Takes awhile to unlock the other games.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Upfront admission: I am and always have been a huge fan of his work.  That said, this is one of the best.  Great story and great characters. The story stands on it's own but the tie in to the Shining makes it that much better.  Stephen King has always had a knack for getting you engaged with his characters, both the good and the bad, and building the story to a conclusion that virtually always has a surprise or two at the end.<br /><br />Highly recommended.
B00EGMQIJ0|3.0|Eggers has written an engaging book that poses the question of whether there can be too much transparency.  \\"The Circle\\" is a company that most will recognize as a satirical likeness of a well know Internet search provider.  \\"A cautionary tale\\" is the hackneyed phrase likely to be applied most to this novel, but Mae Holland is no Winston Smith or Bernard Marx.  Kalden in no Ty nor is The Circle Big Brother or the World State, even if the Circle aspires to be one.  The novel doesn't provoke as much critical thinking about the role of transparency in government or the limits of participatory politics because it describes only extremes.  Eggers is a gifted writer, but he falls far short of Orwell in this effort.
B008AK8FHM|3.0|Sure, there's questions about what's beyond -- science can't, or at least hasn't yet -- explained all, but just because it hasn't doesn't mean will fill the void of information with tales from a coma. Apocryphal, not a proof.
B00BPDR3F6|5.0|I haven't even finished her book yet and I can't put it down!  Her development of the characters is excellent and the subject matter is refreshingly new.  It encompasses an interesting time frame in history and I can't wait to see what happens next.  Based on what I've read so far (not even half way through), I highly recommend reading this!
B00CH3DBNQ|5.0|We should all thank our God daily for the freedoms we are allowed as citizens of the United States of America!
B00F35BV64|2.0|What ever happened to originality in movies? This movie is just a copy of about every action movie made during the past 30 years. Hollywood has run out of ideas.

0670024856|2.0|I have not read any of Gilbert's previous books but I've seen her on TED and read some interviews and she is a very bright, smart person.  When I read what Signature was going to be about - spiritual discoveries, questions about life - I was excited to read her book.  I do not like the phrase &#34;chick-lit&#34; because half of the books I read are by women (I'm male) but that's what how this book comes across.  I felt like I was reading a book written in the 1800's and perhaps that was Gilbert's purpose.  I don't think she spent much time addressing the issues that the blurbs talk about.  She most definitely took the viewpoints of women over men.  It was a disappointment for me, though I did like her definition of the Signature of All Things.  I just wished she would have spent more time on the serious issues she brought up rather than the superficial things she wrote about.
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|Good playing for kids small and easy to match up. For us older folk it's very easy to very hard,  good for everybody.
B00DJ735KI|5.0|This book introduces the non-DNA explanation for how we inherit traits.  It shows how the cell membrane is really in control of how cells, and therefore whole organisms, control our lives.  This is an emerging field and Dr. Lipton does an excellent job of showing where it is headed in an engaging style.
B003K1EYM6|4.0|It is the Apple product and works. My only regret is that I am slowly converting to the lightning adapters so this is becoming less needed.
B006KSAPV0|5.0|Excellent story, twisted, but a good metaphor on many levels. Very good music too. I've seen it a couple of times.
B004DLPXAO|4.0|Love this, my favorite is the free books. Need more of a verity Tho. Descriptions of the books should better.
B0030MTQNW|5.0|Must see for any war movie buff. This one is a classic, lots of big time stars in this movie.
B000JMKNJ2|5.0|A fun adventure with a mix of ocean's eleven flair and a healthy dose of tragedy.  I highly recommend it and look forward to reading the next book.
B0084AZXKK|5.0|Just a beautifully constructed story of sweet revenge from beginning to end. Just a tad long winded in the middle  but stll a masterpeice.
B00BD99JMW|3.0|I pre-ordered Allegiant after reading the first 2 books in the trilogy.  I finished it last night, and I have to say I am disappointed.<br /><br />First off, I don't like the two voices switching off.  I think that was confusing, and the two didn't really seem all that different.  Sometimes I had to look back to see who was the narrator of that chapter.<br /><br />Secondly, I found the whole GP, GD thing confusing and not fleshed out completely.  Were the GP people who never underwent genetic \\"fixing\\"?  Did generations of GD reproducing produce GP?  Is GP what Divergent people are?  And the Purity War - did the GP start it, and win it, and destroy all media/books/files about history so that no one know there were wars before that one?  Huh?  That just doesn't make a lot of sense to me.  I was looking forward to finding out WHY Chicago was destroyed and cut off, and WHY these people separated into factions.  This just didn't do it for me - it seemed like a rushed answer.<br /><br />Third - I know it's a young adult book, but come on - they escape the city and live, for a time, in relative peace in the government compound - in a DORMITORY??  In an old airport Hilton with tons of guest rooms that I assume all have beds - we put these young adults in a dormitory?  Enough with the kissing and touching - let them find a bed and DO IT!<br /><br />And lastly, the ending.  I didn't like the ending.  But, I didn't hate it either.  I read a review here by Stephanie, and she wrote an alternate ending that I really like.  I'm going to pretend that's the way the book really ended.<br /><br />I guess I just had higher expectations for this book that weren't met.
125000098X|5.0|This is a well written story with more curve balls and twists.  Absolutely enjoyed Archers' style and each character in the story.  Well done.  Mike J.
B008KHRODG|5.0|It is David Tennant as the Doctor. In his specials. For his last season. We (sadly) get to see him regenerate. Need I say more?
B00G9U7R2O|5.0|Not as good as the original but pretty entertaining and clever. I recommend this movie for all families, Disney really have a formula for success.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|This was a great book. I literally could not put it down. The author kept you on the edge of you're seat for the entire ride. I highly recommend.
B00EY7LT9Q|5.0|Once again Josh has made another series that I love, but of course that just means its inevitably doomed to be canceled by the networks who wouldn't know a good show if it bit them on the &#34;you know what&#34;. So BUY IT NOW before the people who took off Jericho, Fire Fly, and every other show we all like, take this one off too!
B0035HKWM6|4.0|This is one of the most amazing movies that I have watched when I was a kid and then rewatched many times later. Definitely worth spending time if you haven't seen it. Will make you laugh a lot.
B00B8M4IMK|5.0|I received my car charger just days after I placed my order, and I love the capability of being able to charge my phone AND another device at the same time!  Thank you!
B003O86FMW|5.0|I love th<br />e Hunger Games series more than any other book in the world! I love the Inspiration for the people in the book. I hope you love it as much as I do!
B00A2H9WW8|3.0|If you have seen the original Carrie, this remake will bore you to tears. Sure, they added cyber bullying to the film, big deal. The acting was great, but so was the original. Did the &#34;Plug it up&#34; scene surprise anybody? Did anybody not know what was going to happen with the pig's blood? The fire? the automobile? the mom? And what about the ending? I recall watching the original Carrie in the theater. That surprise ending literally had people jumping out of their chairs. This one put me to sleep. It was like watching a film where someone told you everything that was going to happen.<br /><br />Why did they even bother?
B0058O84G0|5.0|The Fall of Giants.  This book was most enjoyable!  Ken Follett is an amazing author and I highly recommend his work!
B00102FELM|5.0|What a show! Very well done, as far as picture and sound goes. Then comes the band, after all the years. Well they rock just as well as they did back in the day. If not maybe better! Loads of thier best music! What more could you ask for? And one more thing I loved about it was, No Cussing! Seems to me some bands could learn from the Scorpion's. On how to act like a pro. If not then just shut up and sing!
1476729085|4.0|I am going to make this nice and short.  Awesome book, could not put it down. Read for hours straight.
B009VIZDLI|5.0|I was captivated from the first page and could not put the book down.  Loads of humour to enjoy along the way.
B007P3S1AQ|2.0|Not at all what I expected from the Trailer and the previews that I had seen.  Very slow moving and not at all enjoyable.
B009JZSC9S|5.0|Love this show!  Love the characters, the writers, everything.  It is my favorite TV show.  Can't wait for the next episode.
1401937519|5.0|I've seen her in person and heard her story, but I love rereading the book for inspiration to learn how to be 'me'. What a gift her story has been for my life. I ordered extra copies to give as gifts. They may not appreciate the value I place on the book but at least I know I have shared the information.
B009RH9HDS|1.0|The angle on it is not flat enough to use the touch easily. I returned it 10 minutes after I got it
1594203334|5.0|Loved the different perspectives on parenting, told with wit and humor. We all have things to learn from other cultures, and it's interesting to see it play out in this book.
B000L53D4O|5.0|We put this item on our son's first birthday wish list. He got it a few days early and immediately knew what it was for. At the time he was already cruising pretty good but not really using his walking skills. He popped right up and started pushing this all over the living room. We have hardwood floors and he can maneuver this around easily. I would imagine that this will also work well on carpet. It is very stable and his only falls are due to user (his) error. It also seems really durable. We love it because it does roll quite easily and encourages him to just use it as a confidence builder. Now at 13MOS he runs around with this toy and picks it up to turn around. He is just now taking his first real independent steps. I'm sure when he does gain confidence he is just going to take off running.<br /><br />Don't waste your time with more expensive walkers that have more bells and whistles on the front. This one is perfect. My son likes to spin the various toys in front occasionally but it is primarily just a push toy.
B008602KQI|5.0|I liked the movie and it is very close to the book. Looking forward to the next Hunger Game movie.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I definitely recommend this app! my friend told me about it when it was on the computer, and it sounded fun but it wasn't an app for Kindle Fires, so I was disappointed... :( but now it is and im happy and having fun playing this!! get it!!!! :)
B000FC1HBY|5.0|I really enjoyed this book . I have always enjoyed this period. Of history. I liked all the intrigue and mystery of every day life.

B00EDPFJA4|5.0|As a huge Drake fan I can say he never disappoints me ! The album to me is awesome. The condition the C.D. came in was brand new and I also LOVE how with the purchase of the album you can download the songs directly to your music library straight from your smart phone! I didn't have to get anxious waiting on the c.d. to come in because as soon as I ordered, amazon cloud was available for music download ! I would recommend to anyone!
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|This game reminds me of my angry daughter, so it goes so well in the family and we play this game every chance we get which is about once a year but it's awesome
006202406X|1.0|I read this book while recovering from surgery. The first two had been amazing, so maybe my expectations were a little high. I actually had to read that painfully pointless ending four times, as I was sure the pain meds had made me hallucinate the outcome.<br /><br />I'm sure the author felt she was brave for ending her series that way. But in doing so, she lost her way AND she forgot her audience.<br /><br />I hope with time and some maturity, she revisits this book. The entire book, not just the ending.
0156013924|5.0|I teach private Spanish lessons and this book was perfect for one of my students, he enjoys it very much and give him the opportunity to learn more vocabulary.<br />Thanks
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|The game is fun and addictive.  The programming needs polishing.  Sometimes the game gets hung up and the player has to start over.
B00D7NWTSI|4.0|Great Movie! The best movie in the trilogy. I would definitely recommend to anyone who is a fan of these type of films.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|My favorite is showing the time in words with the wood look background. Works great and easy to use and understand.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|I didn't give this a full five stars because I don't like that it doesn't stay charged very long being connected to the t.v. and doesn't come with a cord that reaches to a wall outlet, just a plug to connect it to a wall outlet once you find a cord for it (we use our ipad cord). It walks you through the whole process which is pretty easy and only takes about 15 minutes which is great.<br />Youtube comes in perfectly and netflix works really well. I've heard hulu+ is going to be allowing chromecast access soon as well although you can still get on the website and cast it, it's just not as clear since you're not streaming as directly as you can with netflix right now.<br />If you use chrome browser you can cast pretty much everything you can think of onto your t.v. We use a great movie site and have been able to watch all the movies we want on our t.v. instead of having to huddle around our small computer screen. It's great for traveling too. All you have to worry about is the dongle and the cord so they pack nicely.<br />Honestly for a 35$ flat fee this just can't be beat. It's brand new too so you know it can only get better. It's definitely worth the money in my opinion.
B00EGMQIJ0|2.0|The author has a good idea for a novel here, but the execution leads something to be desired.  Outside of some mildly &#34;adult&#34; situations, this book reads like a typical Young Adult novel.  Every element of &#34;The Circle&#34; is oversimplified and dumbed down.  Characters are poorly developed and never seem to act/react in a realistic way, conflicts are pretty black-and-white, and the themes are far too simple given the true complexity of the subject of the book.<br />Eggers says he did zero research on the subject matter, and this shows far too often.  He plays on ignorant fear and assumption instead of exploring the true complexity of the issues in the book.
B0083SBMBM|5.0|One of my son wanted this for Christmas, 2012 and is enjoying it very much.<br />Thank you for a clean transaction.
B0063M22QO|4.0|Enjoy the game. It can keep you on your toes, yet relaxing also. Takes your mind off of everything. Like this very much.
B001VU1NJ0|2.0|Typical thug style where the innocent pays the price and guilty gets to go free.  Actually feel like I've lost 2 hours of my time that I'd like back.  ehhhh!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|So addictive! Love that I can now play it on my Kindle Fire! Thank You for have it in my free downloads!
0307352153|4.0|so interesting - showed me the ways introverts behave & helped me recognize why I do some things. like look for a job at parties to avoid schmoozing.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Love this game! So glad it finally came out on the kindle. Now if they will just bring it to Windows phones!
B000FBFN1U|5.0|I read as I commute to work, so I only read a couple hours a day and boy is this a long book [ just like the first two books ].  Lots of twists and turns that will hold your attention.  I haven't seen any of the series on tv and I don't care if I do because the book is well written and easy to follow.  I was originally afraid that the books would be too much fantasy, sorcery and such but it's not.  It does have those elements, but it's never over done or contrieved.  It's all well balanced and you keep wanting to read to see what next will happen.
B0031ES8P6|5.0|My granddaughter is 3 years old and loves anything that is hello kitty.  Yes, she loved this beanie baby and I would recommend it .
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Very enjoyable! Our whole family is addicted. There several different levels of difficulty. Worth every minute of play time. Would recommend to anyone.
B00C7TAF3Y|4.0|The graphics are great. It ran smoothly on my KFHD. The puzzles were the perfect difficulty level for me - made me think but weren't so hard I felt like an idiot, or so easy that I got bored. I would have given it 5 stars, but I got The Room as a FAotD, if I'd paid for it I would feel it was way too short. It's only got like six puzzles.
0743289692|5.0|Everything about Ayaan Hirsi Ali seems larger than life. Most Americans first learned of the statuesque African, then a member of the Dutch Parliament, when Theo van Gogh was murdered in 2004 for making an anti-Islamic film with her. The ruling party fell from power when it tried to revoke her Dutch citizenship.<br /><br />A gifted thinker, speaker and writer, Ali, 37, has produced her second bestseller in three years. Her first book, The Caged Virgin, compiled her essays. Half the length of her current book, and heavy in polemics, it did not tell her own story as completely as Infidel, which should have an index.<br /><br />Infidel abounds in autobiographical details, often harrowing, sometimes mundane. She survives a horrifying clitoridectomy with old scissors at the age of 5, grows to confront the blood-chilling demands of family and clan, bribes police, evades gun-slinging rebels, and rescues loved ones amid thousands of ghostlike refugees. She tells it all with a warmth and transparency that may satisfy complaints about her lack of full disclosure when she sought asylum in the Netherlands.<br /><br />She dedicates the book to the family that sometimes brutalized and disowned her, remembering how much she still owes them. Ali emerges as a compassionate person in the midst of a purposeful life.<br /><br />More than that: She brings great intellectual honesty to examining her Islamic faith in light of the 9/11 attacks — an example that Americans raised in Christianity ought to follow. How did such vast numbers of Christians forsake their Gospel to wage preemptive war?<br /><br />With trepidation, Ali looks up the hate-filled scriptures quoted by Osama bin Laden, and finds that the Quran says exactly what he claimed. Does she believe those scriptures came from God? And if not, does she still believe in God? And if not, does she risk going to Hell?<br /><br />Ali answers no to all three questions, an enormous act of courage. She also condemns multiculturalism, that sacred cow of Western liberals.<br /><br />To have landed in Holland, the pinnacle of tolerance, after the tyrannies she endured in Somalia, Saudi Arabia, Ethiopia and Kenya, suggests some sort of providence: “I wanted to understand why life in Holland was so different from life in Africa. Why there was so much peace, security and wealth in Europe. What the causes of war were, and how you built peace.”<br /><br />Recently catapulted into Washington’s conservative American Enterprise Institute, is Ali now being packaged as our next best weapon against Islam? Or will she once again startle these new colleagues with insights they had not bargained for? She has landed in the perfect place to unravel the connections between wealth and wars.
B00A285OOW|5.0|Phillippa Gregory has again woven her magic and kept me enthralled to the point that I could hardly put this book down.The relationship between Henry and his White Rose wife, the Queen is extraordinary.<br />Aprilatex
B008JFUPOY|5.0|This movie stays true to the Monsters love! The overall movie is great even for grown ups!<br />The plot and overall theme that as long as you put your mind to it you can accomplish it all is a great thing to teach children.<br /><br />The details in the characters though wow its looks great on our Vizo TV. They put a lot of work into this movie.
B0041D843M|5.0|It all started with a melanoma! I read the whole book and numerous sections repeatedly, IT MAKES SO MUCH SENSE!!!<br />I've ordered the related books and am inspired to keep working at changing my eating habits, although it doesn't happen overnight, it is a gradual process for me but I have cut way back on many 'certain' foods!  I have since found out my melanoma is gone, but I am still working at this way of life and see a difference in how I feel.<br />Get it, you will see how much of what we eat affects us.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Love this game. I am stuck on level 23 but my FB friends have helped me with some extra lives.
0765315246|5.0|This has to be my favorite book by Scalzi. Just stumbled across the author through Redshirts, and got hooked on his writing style.
B00G2SIW7M|1.0|Just awful.  Well, unless you like the sound of drum machines, lame for-dancing bass lines, tired out-of-the-drawer production.  Compared to their previous albums, incredibly average and canned. The only reason the lemmings are raving about it is because they know it's Arcade Fire so they think it must be good.  It isn't.
B003G4W49C|5.0|Interesting lessons to be learned about the human beingd.  Definitely a page-turner that everyone should read and will enjoy reading.
B004MC0FO8|5.0|Awesome...never fails to find the correct song every time :)  I have recommended it to quite a few people who have agreed!
B004W7GPXI|5.0|Fairly new to Parsifal I wanted a good, clear recording at an affordable price.  This is just what I got.  And, it's absolutely gorgeous.  4 CD's and I wish there were more.
1451666179|5.0|If I could draw an \\"I love this book\\" Alot, I would (go read the blog :) ). I've been reading her blog for years, I can't think of too many authors who deserves this more than Allie Brosh. Her blog is absolutely hilarious, and has tons of stories on there. I suggest reading a few (hyperboleandahalf.blogspot.com) if you're at all hesitant about buying this book.<br /><br />I know I'll be purchasing many more as stocking stuffers for my family. You will love her stories--they're entirely relatable and the illustrations are absolutely hilarious.  I can't say much else other than that it will be the best 10 bucks you've spent all week.<br /><br />I suppose I'll also add that the book itself is high quality, and as other reviewers have noted, each story is printed on different colored pages.<br /><br />If you like cake, you'll love this book.<br />If you have dogs, you'll love this book.<br />If you've ever had depression, you'll love this book.<br />If you have a sense of humor, you'll love this book.<br />If you like illustrations, you'll love this book.<br />Go get it!
B003EYVY04|5.0|I love these versions of the movies. So much extra stuff and these are cheaper, especially with that new HUGE pack that they have now.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love candy crush it's very addicting. And i love that it is FINALLY on the amazon app store. Very good.
B00BGI086Q|5.0|action mystery and suspense  keeps  you guessing till the  end of season . the characters work well together if you read dc comics  when you where young<br />you will love the way they humanized the character watch one episode and you will  be hooked
B002VECM6S|5.0|This is a movie I really like, my husband gave to another person to watch who refused to return it so I had to buy another one
B004SIIBGU|5.0|Everything you need is in one place.  Convenient.  Easy to navigate.  Call at your fingertips.  A great site!  Try it out!
B00G0KY1UO|5.0|This game is is better than the offer regular show app and also there`s like 10000 levels too. also there`s like 20 people!
B00GD9F59S|5.0|I just finished Sentinel and am still trying to process what I just read. There were so many hilarious moments that sent me into uncontrollable laughing fits. There were also very touching and emotional moments that had me bawling like a baby. *Slight Spoilers Ahead* Okay, the ending was surprising, not the one I wanted but even better. It was far less upsetting than the ending Allegiant (You will understand what I mean once you have read it). There is a lot of death but also redemption and forgiveness. It is action-packed and had plenty of steamy scenes. Aiden is even more swoon-worthy than ever. Overall, it was a very satisfying and beautiful ending to an amazing series. I promise that you will not be disappointed.
B009KWU6Q2|5.0|Favorite for all ages! Would recommend for a fun family film. Came thru great on Prime, would recommend Prime, it's worth the money!
B005SEYOXW|5.0|Extremely disappointed this series was cancelled. Hopefully the crew will get back together someday and continue this amazing story. Don't forget to check out the comic books!
B00E9ZATJO|3.0|I have seen Monsters Inc. several times and enjoyed it so I was hoping this prequel would be of the same caliber.  Nope.  The story is basically a remake of \\"Revenge Of The Nerds\\" (but less funny).  Mike and Scully are in college and they end up getting kicked out of \\"scare\\" class.  OK, then they join a fraternity of nerds who take part in the \\"Scare Games\\".  Of course they win but you could see the win coming from a mile away. I managed to sit through the whole thing with my grandson but I won't ever watch it again.  It drags, there are no really laugh-out-loud moments like there was in Monsters, Inc. and, other than the two main characters, no character you could really like.  All in all I felt it was a waste of time and even my 10 year old grandson wasn't all that impressed. I would really like to give it only two and a half stars,
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|Even as an adult, I find this game fun. I would recommend it to anyone, kids or adults. I play it all the time.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Candy Crush is fun. Great way to destress and pass time.<br />Love it. Works well on my Kindle Fire. I would recommend it to anyone of any age.
B00BAXFAOW|5.0|Mr. Gladwell likes to look at the other side.  Things may happen, but not as we think  and in many cases the underdog can win, with examples presented to prove his point. He definitely challenges thinking
B00CHIMG6Y|4.0|Nice docu-drama. I was interested in the story line before I saw this. The kids steal the show, especially the oldest.
B001FB4VY4|5.0|I will be getting the rest of the series on blu-ray as well.  A must watch for any nerd or geek!
B00066FBQG|5.0|Great acting, great action, funny, great photography, a great way to see the end of the lawless days of the old west
0143034901|5.0|THIS is a great book. It's rare that I give a book 5 stars, but this one book stands out because of the gifted and skilled writing of Zafon.  His ability to describe Gothic Barcelona, the people, the smells, the atmosphere - it's as if you are there. He paints the most vivid descriptions without being overly wordy and superfluous. Ever read a book where the descriptions go on and on and on and you find yourself skipping paragraphs just to get back to the story? Well you dont find yourself doing that in this book. The prose IS part of the story.<br /><br />The same way he paints the picture of his world is the same way he depicts his characters. You really connect with them. You feel what they are feeling, you see through their eyes.<br /><br />The plot moves forward at a nice pace - never too hectic (via Dan Brown) but never lags. Secrets unfold in due time - they aren't rushed and the twists that show up are methodically set up throughout the entire book so that they make 'sense' when they are revealed.<br /><br />I found this book in the used bookstore and I felt like I too had found a book from the Cemetery of Forgotten Books. Loved it! Great reading! Enjoy!
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Loads of fun and a blast to play.  Great for all ages. Would recommend it to my friends and family.
0345531957|5.0|Right from the first page I became hooked on the story of Patrick, the young lawyer who stole a lot of money, changed identities, and disappeared into the wilds of Brazil. The plot speaks to a part of many people who fantasize about changing their lives and getting out of the daily rat race.<br /><br />Grisham has written some books that go truly deep (\\"The Confession\\", for ex.). This is not one of those that haunt you and make you think. But it is certainly a masterful product with a watertight plot, complete control of characters and dialog, suspense galore, and that magic that makes you forget it's a made-up story!
B004ADB17Y|5.0|5 stars for unique story, great acting, and a classic 80's movie that you want to watch over and over again.
B00F8LPH90|2.0|The graphics were underwelming.  I deleted it from the tablet within 5 minutes of loading it.<br />It could be better.
B00BQPEIT2|4.0|I have not seen my son in days. He loves this game. Well this and a few others fun and brainless and easy to get the hang of. both my 7 and 4 year old love the game.
B00BSB2AE4|5.0|I was really sick when I read this and every time I laughed I broke out in horrible painful racking coughs.  It was totally worth it.  Thanks Allow, you are the best.

0765365278|5.0|I really enjoyed this novel.  It has a unique (in my experience) take on Magic, which some may argue is still derivative (Philosophically speaking, some would argue everything is), but I enjoyed it, and could not put it down.  There are a few two dimensional characters, but far more developed characters with multiple facets.  The story is intriguing, the plot is logical (void of massive holes.  Granted, I am very good as suspending disbelief, and getting into a story, so I don't notice a lot of plot holes when the writing is good.  Which it is in this case. There may be plot holes, but I didn't notice them).  I am looking forward to the next installment of this series.<br /><br />I have read some of Sanderson's other works (The Mistborn Series, primarily).  This novel is a good leap and bound ahead of that series, in its writing.  Although I enjoyed the Mistborn Series (for the most part), this novel was far more enjoyable, and has the potential to be a VERY memorable series on par with the Name of the Wind (although the writing style is completely different.  This series should not be compared directly to the Name of the Wind series, as they are vastly different types of novels, in my opinion.  But both in the top for new fiction in their type).<br /><br />This is a series to watch closely as it comes out.
0385344228|5.0|Kept my interest from the first paragraph until the last word.  Had trouble putting it down.  Author tells a good story.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|I have never been more moved by a novel than this one. Veronica Roth will give you hopes, tear your heart out, and change your way of thinking forever. She is purely brilliant.
B007SGLZP8|3.0|An OK read; not one of Grisham's best. 12 more words are demanded, so here goes: 9 10 11 12
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I love this game. My son got me started now I can't stop. I really enjoy watching my property grow.
B008M7JODC|5.0|Awesome show! Sci-fi done right. Great characters and excellent show plot. Lots of action, some romance, epic suspense in every episode.

B00CKJ2KK2|5.0|this is really the best online game in the world. It has awesome missions to. The characters are so cool. They have awesome guns to. The whole point is that this game is really the best online game ever.
B00BD99JMW|3.0|I so enjoyed Divergent and Insurgent and pre-ordered Allegiant months ago. The writing style was different- less developed/thorough and like so many other reviewers have expressed, that left me less invested in the story and characters. Many plots didn't seem well thought out and I was just disappointed that after all the waiting, this was the end of what had been a really well written series.
B005GFPZYK|4.0|Gives a very detailed story into a world the news won't show us. These guys are brave and deserve respect.

B00EGMQIJ0|4.0|This was a great read; timely too. Didn't know how it would end. Book gives clear insight to implications of social networking and big data.<br /><br />Dave Eggers style is easy to read. They should make this book into a movie.

B00499QUK2|5.0|I'm a huge Sherlock fan.  Still consider Jeremy Brett the best ever but I do find this version to be a high-caliber modern day version of Sherlock.  Well acted, well written, and tricky twists to the plot that I didn't see coming.  I only wish they would make more than 3 per season.
1451666179|5.0|I've been a reader of the Hyperbole and a Half Blog for a decent amount of time, and was thrilled to buy this book. Many posts come from the blog, but somehow the colors and flow of the stories are really enhanced by this books format. The writing is witty and sincere as always. A great addition to any living room.

B001992NUQ|1.0|I thought the R rating was for the fight scenes. And, based on positive reviews, purchased this DVD.<br />After watching it for a 3/4 of an hour, due to its dgree of vulgarity, stopped, cut the disc into pieces and disposed of it into the trash can.

Some people get caught in an elevator in a skyscraper, and people begin to die.  The fire department is rushing against the clock to get them out, but will anyone be left alive?

B0024JG5AO|5.0|This is truly worthy of your consideration, O reader, among the many editions of Shakespeare, for several reasons, summarizd below.<br /><br />But first clarification of which \\"this.\\" The\\"this\\" being reviewed is the hard-cover, 1936 printing by Garden City Books, Garden City, NY of the Cambridge Edition Text, edited by William Aldis Wright, including the Temple Notes, illustrated by Rockwell Kent, and with a preface (\\"Letter to the Reader\\") by Christopher Morley.<br /><br />This is the edition which has two columns per page, black-and-white illustrations by Rockwell Kent at his best, and an introductory essay by that passionate Shakespearian, Christopher Morley.  Ihe edition was copyrighted in 1936 by Doubleday & Company, Inc., although printed by Garden Ciy Books.<br /><br />There are other editions with the Rockwell Kent illustrations. However, these have been criticized for production problems and are not of the signature-bound legacy quality of this one.  It can be worth any extra search to find this olden & golden classic edition, perhaps even if you luck on to a First Folio in a bookstall.<br /><br />Still, why \\"buy this?\\"<br /><br />--This is the complete works as we know them (circa 1936) including all the plays and all the poems such as \\"Venus and Adonis,\\" the luminous & troubling \\"Sonnets,\\" and \\"The Phoenix and the Turtle.\\"<br /><br />--There are many reader-friendly features, such as extensive and erudite notes for all the works, given as an appendix<br /><br />--A glossary, clear and thorough<br /><br />--An index of characters and an index of first lines; nice, nice, very nice!<br /><br />--There are forty-four full-page illustrations by Rockwell Kent, each illustrating a well-chosen line from the play being introduced  (\\"O Rosalind! these trees shall be my books,\\" says the smitten Orlando (p. 664) and \\"Why is my lord enrag'd against his love?\\" asks the sensuous Cleopatra entwined against a brows-bent Anthony (p. 1058).<br /><br />--The print is clear, the type-size easily readable, the 1,529 pages while not vellum-like, will stand-up to years of use.  At least the pages of my copy, much read for almost 65 years, are not foxed, torn, or crumbling and this book has travelled with me over the hills and far away.<br /><br />--Most of all, the editor has done his work brilliantly: choices among texts are explained in the appendix notes, the plays read with the trumpets and thunder and where appropriate, the flutes and flagolets of Shakespeare, and whatever most readers may seek of Shakespeare, they are likely to find it here, in one beautifully produced book.<br /><br />Reader Alert:  Light, this is not.  A strong lap, a reading table, on your bed----all work, or maybe a mighty two-handed reader can hold it. Does take 4 inches on your bookshelf, too.<br /><br />Recommended with all my heart, and with hopes that other readers will buy and treasure this splendid edition.the type-size easily readable, the 1,529 pages while not vellum-like, will stand-up to years of use.

B0084670FU|3.0|It rambles back and forth, it kept my interest as I was wondering what was going on in the different cities. There was some filler.
0316074314|4.0|Tom Stoppard's \\"Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead\\" ends as the spotlight fades with the words, \\"Now you see us, now.....\\" and our minds fill in \\"now you don't.\\"  But did we ever really see them or understand their efforts to interprete what the h*ck was going on?<br /><br />Eleanor Catton's \\"The Luminaries\\" can be read as a rousing story of New Zealand's mining camp days on the Otago pennisula, where men will do just about anything for gold, women may be no less devious and a lot more imaginative, and the vulnerable get mowed down like rabbits.<br /><br />At the center, as this story unfolds, is Anna Wetherell, about as unfriended in any true way, as a person can be although the most sought-after prostit*te in Hokitika.  Around her and interacting in often mysterious ways are nineteen other significant characters, including Crosbie Wells.  Crosbie is dead when the story opens: he may have died poorly, but he may not have died poor.  How much gold?  Who has it now?  To whom may it really belong? Who knows what is happening and who is after  it?  Or is it and are they?<br /><br />And who is asking such questions?  Well, almost everyone, almost all the time.<br /><br />As a result of this richnesse of character and incident, almost every paragraph of \\"Luminaries\\" is laced with names & speculation.  For example,<br /><br />\\"Moody was frowning.  In June of the previous year, Francis Carver had been in possession of Crosbie Wells's birth certificate, a document that proved (as Benjamin Lowenthal had attested) that Crosbie Wells's middle name was Francis.  Why, Moody thought, it was plain enough:  Francis Carver had stolen Crosbie Wells's birth certificate with the intention of posing as the other man.  The ambiguities of this bill of sale must surely be deliberate.  If Carver were brought to court on the charge of false impersonation, he could deny that he had ever signed it.\\" (p.468)<br /><br />\\"Luminaries\\" is complex enough, in other words, but there are at least two distinctive additions for the reader.  First, chapter lengths follow from full to dark of the moon in length and there are 12 chapters or Parts beginning with the 360 pages of chapter I (\\"A Sphere Within a Sphere\\") and closing with chapter XII (\\"The Old Moon in the Young Moon's Arms\\") which is a page & a half long.  Actually, about the same amount of exposition is covered in each but the early chapters have full dialog and exposition while later chapters use the Victorian italic summaries of events that the reader's imagination must fill in, with a minimum of dialog.  Thus, intentionally, the rendering of full moon=all revealed chapter to dark of the moon=much concealed.<br /><br />Second, the 12 \\"luminary\\" characters, all of whom may be involved with Crosbie Wells's death, are linked to signs of the zodiac & aligned with the traits of each sign.  The dates (such as 14 January 1866) and latitude & longitude are specified in the chart fronting each chapter, showing the planetary influences for that date & latitude/longitude on the characters appearing in that part.  Astrologically inclined readers will probably find out the 12 charts are precise for date and place, which could add to the fascination of finding out how the written-in-the-stars works out on earth, with all too earthly beings.<br /><br />Readers who are intrigued by this interplay of earth and stars, of nineteen sharply drawn characters, of the historical setting of 1866 New Zealand when Maori and Pakeha cultures were striving for ascendancy, and of a tautly plotted mystery with twists, turns, depths and heights may give \\"Luminaries\\" their own Man Booker prize.  Some may find the tight framework of astrology a bit precious, even though one can read this as a novel without getting entwined with how it was constructed----and may the guardian of hard-working authors who sweat over this kind of effort forgive me.<br /><br />Overall, \\"Luminaries\\" is well-written but not awesomely so, as the quoted paragraph suggests.  The characters are vivid but may not engage our pity, admiration, or wonder.  For me, the exception is Anna, whose plight may move the reader's heart and make us wish for a time machine to rescue this Eloi from the mostly Morlock world.<br /><br />Recommended as a fascinating book, yet I can't say I five-star loved it.h suggests.

006202406X|2.0|I was very disappointed for most of the book not seeing where she was taking everything but by the last 100 pages where she starts just to lay everything out for you I was hooked. The twist that happens didn't really sink in for me until I was reading the last chapter 10 minutes later and even though throughout this entire series I was not in love with these books Veronica Roth had me heart broken by the way she ended it and yet I don't believe she could have ended it better. I was suspecting a stupid 'teen girl ending' like twilight and hunger games where all that really happens is the two lovers end up together in the end. Overall a dissapointing book because she didn't actually study the topic that she was writing about but enjoyed the end.
B00COGZ8FU|4.0|I was glad the plot was not completely predictable like so many films in this genre.  Some of the action scenes defied credibility -- but who watches a Tom Cruise action flick for its plausibility ?
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|I have had a Roku and Apple TV, and this thing, for the price and functionality, is my favorite of them all.  I use the Chromecast in my living room because it is hidden perfectly, with no wires showing...I am a huge fan of this device and am looking forward to seeing how it is integrated with other services.
B00BVYLBP2|5.0|This is an excellent show.  I started watching the reruns on TV and before I knew it I was on Amazon Prime buying episodes and having an Orphan Black marathon. Tatiana Maslany's performance as all the different clones is extraordinary.  I love the character Felix too. I'm anxiously awaiting season two.
B000068G9X|5.0|5 stars from me, as it was an easy, economical transaction on a perfect item. The only way it could have been better is if it were on record or soft copy.
B00004XQ83|4.0|One of my favorite ones, the soundtrack is also superb, I liked it so much I had to get it as well.
B000065PUE|5.0|it's Doolittle, it's the Pixies, it's great.  play it loud and jon that monkey going to heaven.  a classic one must own
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|This puzzle  is excellent!!!!  It reminds me of Myst.  I loved that game.  The notes add the human touch.  The best 1.99 I have spent for a puzzle game yet.
B00CUKTG2Q|4.0|another great FF album.  the usual infectious twin guitar assualt is appreciated as always.  The title track, evil eye, love illumination and stand on the horizon start the record off with non-stop energy, great lyrics, and just great tunes.  fresh strawberries doesn't seem to fit and some of the later songs seem to get bogged down.  however,bullet,the universe expanded and brief encounters rewturn to that FF intensity.  i have listened to this over 100 ties and can't wait for the next 100!  highly recommended.  .  My second favorite FF Album with Tonight: Franz Ferdinand being my sleazy favorite.  highly recommended

B007Y2W44W|5.0|Five out of five stars.  Excellent at their Egyptian themed craft of death metal!  New sounding, as in recording a more stripped down sound somehow.  Just means... play louder!  Over before you know it.  The speed and slower sections will carry you from beginning to end as you are enthralled with the technical accuracy.  Buy it.  Really.

1490313370|5.0|What a wonderful book.  I enjoyed every chapter and it really spoke to me.  If you are looking for a book that gets to the point and isn't fluff then this is your book.
B00BEZTMQ8|5.0|The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey shows that Peter Jackson is back and better than ever. This has to be one of the most accurate book to movie adaptations ever done, and Jackson sticks to the books events all the way through, only adding more backstory that was touched on in the book, but was never fully explained. Thankfully Jackson draws much of the film's material from The Lord of the Rings appendices, which really makes the movie a lot more interesting. Many people may not realize this, but Tolkien actually spent a lot of time editing and revising the Hobbit to add more story and make it more similar in tone to LotR, but he just never got around to finishing and publishing it. Jackson realized this and tried to make his adaption more faithful to that fact, and that really shows how much respect for Tolkien and his work. It sticks to the events of the book, and smartly adds new character motives to explain why certain things happen, and why certain characters acted the way they did, which wasn't in the book. This review is for the actual movie itself though, and not this edition. In terms of the actual quality of the Blu-Ray disc, the Hobbit  may be the best looking Blu-Ray film I've ever seen. The landscape, CGI, acting, and the soundtrack are amplified by the supreme quality of the disc. Jackson really knows what he's doing with Blu-ray transfers. I would recommend waiting until November 5 for the extended edition. The extended version  will feature 13 minutes of extra footage, which includes more footage of Smaug. I would recommend renting the theatrical cut, and then purchase the extended edition.

B00CM4VC7M|4.0|S.H. figuarts Sailor Moon is a fantastic figure.  I was lucky enough to get the first release bonus faces which really do make the figure.  There are only two issues currently observed with the figure.  First the paint in the hair makes changing faces a little bothersome.  Also her design makes her seem more fragile than other figuarts.
B009KS4XRO|3.0|On many occasions it has frozen or lost connectivity and I have lost my credits I enjoy playing this game but this on going problem is putting me off also I play on kindle fire and my partner plays on the iPad and we have noticed that after 5 or6 balls they are out of sync and her calls are before mine bit of an unfair advantage if you ask me
B002KH4KSY|1.0|Ugh. Terrible acting and dialogue. Incomprehensible relationship between the two protagonists. Oh. And not scary. In the least. Instead of being \\"direct to DVD,\\" should probably be \\"direct to betamax.\\"

B005HEDIHG|5.0|I can remember, as a child, that I never wanted to miss Star Trek. I still would not want to miss it. All of the Star Trek Movies, and television shows had to meet the standard of the original Star Trek...The Best Star Trek.<br /><br />The characters meshed very well, I like that they meshed, I like the friendships.<br />I did not like that Captain Kirk slept with &#34;everyone&#34; alien or not.
B0006419J6|5.0|The plot to this movie follows the story line of what happens if we let computers run our life for us. Like 2001 space odisy we see the falts of a computer bast bran trying to reason like a human. This fill is a A+ in my book of faves.

0765365278|3.0|Check the number of pages, before you buy. 1280 pages. If you love long, epic books, or enjoyed the [[ASIN:0812538366 The Wheel of Time]], you may like this. If you are looking for something more like [[ASIN:0765350378 Elantris]], this really isn't it.<br /><br />I was really expecting to like this, but it's just too long for the amount of content, in my opinion. It reminds me of [[ASIN:0345529057 A Song of Ice and Fire]], which started strong, and then left me feeling like I'd wasted the time it took to read 4,000 pages.<br /><br />This series isn't going to be done in less  than 5,000 pages either, and I'm just not interested enough to make that kind of commitment.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I like this game a lot I have hare it for two days and it seems really easy so far but to get extra space you have to have 100000 coins to upgrade two times so if you want this game you might want to check it every day cause if not you will get off task and you wont want to play it any more so make sure you stay on your toes with this game ornyou will loose focus. This game is probably good for ages 6 and up cause they will need to learn some responsiblys to get this game.This game is free which is a big plus cause at that price you gets good game
B0040I09RM|5.0|Well written show that always keeps you guessing! Not a show I expected to like but once we started, we watched all 5 seasons in a week.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Everything you heard about this game is true!  It's totally addictive! I love playing this game. It is easy to use. Get this app now. You won't be disappointed.
B008602KQI|4.0|I am generally snooty about the quality of movies that earn two hours of my life. Every once in a while it is OK to have a fun romp just for the hell of it.<br /><br />While the characters were painted with a broad brush, the plot twists strained my ability to suspend disbelieve, it was like the joy you get from the rare fattening desert you can't resist.<br /><br />I thought Jennifer Lawrence was the perfect reluctant heroine.<br /><br />So if you are one of the few people who has not seen this blockbuster. Go ahead. You can always cut back on the guilty pleasures next week.

B003XVYLDU|5.0|Just read it and see why!  It's about our humanity, our frailties, the horrors of war (centered, to some extent, around the Dresden bombing that the Allies performed killing 200-500K people (estimates obviously vary)...<br />Just read it
B00AAI7B7W|5.0|I got this movie last night for Halloween. this movie freaks me out even at age 27. the only thing that disappointed me though is it wasn't the later uncut version with the &#34;Spider walk&#34; scene. had to look it up on youtube to freak myself out just a little more.<br /><br />if you have never heard about the making of the film this was a real crazy film to shoot. from tying the voice actress to a chair so she could do he demons voice to the ways they had to get Lynda Blare to do some of the crazier scenes even though she was a 13 year old. crazy stuff.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|i was surprised and extremely impressed by this series. it is the best series so far out of all of them, but that is merely a biased point of view. each series has something for everyone, and this one seems to have &#34;done it&#34; for me. you can get addicted easily by these series so watch out!
B005S9EKCW|5.0|I have been waiting for years to see a movie version of Les Miserables.  I have seen the Broadway version many times over, but this was a real treat.  I saw the movie in the theatre 6 times...and bought this as soon as it came out.  I cry every time!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This is my favorite game ever. I absolutely love it. I would highly recommend to everyone. Very addicting. Best of all it is free to download.
B000HT3PPG|5.0|Even in black and white, this movie outshines all the updated attempts of this amazing Christmas classic!  It's simply timeless!
B00D1VKZ3M|5.0|Helen Fielding once again has written a fantastically witty book!<br />Just as enjoyable as the previous Bridge Jones' novels.<br />Sniggered my way through it.<br />You can tell how good a book is; when you actually miss the characters at the end of the novel  and it feels like you are missing a friend!
1476727651|5.0|This is the best Stephen King Book I have read since The Shining!!  Myself and my mother absolutely love it!!!<br />Thanks!!!!
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Amazing book.<br /> I can't say anything bad about it. So intriguing, it makes you keep reading on and on. Exhilarating.
B00A6CCF0K|4.0|Daniel Torrance returns in &#34;Doctor Sleep,&#34; a sort-of sequel to &#34;The Shining.&#34; In &#34;Doctor Sleep,&#34; Daniel is an alcoholic wanderer, finding solace in a new place, using his talent to help the dying, and in Alcoholics Anonymous. But the ghosts of the past have followed him, and a new threat has emerged, one that feeds on talents like his own. The danger is not only to himself, but to others who have &#34;Shining.&#34;<br /><br />The novel is tightly written, and less claustrophobic than &#34;The Shining.&#34; King's love for the character is evident, and we learn more about Daniel than we ever did in his previous story. Daniel is far from a hero, and suffers from his self-inflicted demons in addition to those that followed him from the Outlook Hotel. This is, overall, a hopeful novel, and I enjoyed it.
B00ECU34ZM|4.0|Enjoyed this film. While not fantastic, it was solid in plot and acting. I don't make a habit of picking apart films like this. It wasn't claiming to much and it fulfilled my expectations.
0425266060|5.0|Although, there are some similarities to Fifty Shades of Grey, this is different story of two people with abused past trying to make things work. Very great story.
B00F35BV64|4.0|Great entertaining sequel. Acting was superb. I look forward to more films in this series. This is coming from someone who is not a Trekkie.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|This is my first book by this author.  She captures your interst in the first chapter and keeps it for the duration of the book.
B006IGZWB2|5.0|I had read the book, so it took me a while to get around to seeing the movie.  I thought all of the women who acted the various parts did an outstanding job, especially the women who played Skeeter and Minnie were fantastic!
B00F56AZK4|5.0|Not TOo Hard And Not Too Easy.<br />I Enjoy This Type Of Puzzle.  36 Pieces....Not Too Many An Not Too Few.
B001R4MEUM|5.0|An older review, now lost on a server in a trash heap, was better than this one, but I will attempt to recreate.<br /><br />This is an album (not CD, not MP3, not RPX30--whatever that may eventually be), that deserves its own pedestal in the prog rock pantheon.  666 my Aphrodite?<br /><br />Please don't confuse THIS Genesis with the 80s pop group of the same name. They are the same, but they aren't.<br /><br />My love affair with this album began about 5 years after its initial release, but has continued to this day.  It was one of my select soundtracks for driving through the Taurus Mountains in Turkey; incredible scenery with the appropriate audio images to accompany the view.  Music, lyrics, contrast, production, artistry.  \\"And I'm hovering like a fly, waiting for the windshield on the freeway.\\"  BOOM getting hit with the full force of the band.  This was THE BEST live band of the 70s when bands attempted to outdo each other on stage.  And this was the best album by the best live band.<br /><br />As always, try to listen to this in context, with friends, and in the proper state of mind.  And remember, Jim, the secretary will disavow your actions.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This is the most addictive game ever. Everyone we know who plays it seems to be playing it all the time. We totally enjoy the game.
B000I186FW|5.0|Pretty much sums up how I feel about the current state of our country. Viva LA revolution!! Very well made
0937381888|5.0|I owe Palmer my gratitude. If it wasn't for him I would be lost on the path of becoming a home brewer. My father is a professional brewer and happily agreed to help me learn, but I first read this book twice before embarrassing myself in front of my expert dad. I will always have this book on hand, because even though I know all the basic now to brew, because it is an excellent resource. It has tables for bottle conditioning and how much sugars to use, formulas for calculating IBU's, SRM's, etc. etc. There is so much information in the book I recommend taking notes and/or reading it multiple times. This is a great thing though, because home brewing it very doable but takes a lot of practice and wisdom to improve. Prost!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Got hooked, and now I have no life.  I wake up and play; I go to bed, but before that I have to play.  S.O.B.!  But I love it!
B001EPYQO6|3.0|Sing goddess, the anger of the viewer<br />of Hollywood's devastation, which put pains a thousandfold onto the public<br />hurled in their multitudes into movie theaters -lazy readers<br />and fools, who gave their brains up to mindless drooling.<br /><br />After the movie finished my husband actually said, 'The guy who played Odysseus [ Sean Bean ] was so good, they should have made a movie just about him. ' Well, that may be one reason why I've always preferred the Odyssey.<br /><br />So instead of watching this silliness in which snub nosed Achilles of garbled speech looks ready to jump on his surfboard along with his Swedish cousin; Germanic Helen, a woman who could launch the manufacture of a thousand refrigerators, shares zero chemistry with pansy Paris; the supporting cast of Braveheart chew the scenery, and the end of the story is actually re-written,  please read the original and even better read the Odyssey, a work of incomparable beauty and significance:<br /><br />Speak Muse, and tell me of a much traveled man who was tossed about in many ways after he had sacked Troy's sacred citadel. On his journeys he learned the minds of men and saw their cities. And he suffered many woes in his heart on the open sea. [ my very literal translation, though I really love and recommend Richard Lattimore's more poetic one, which I'm sure you can purchase on Amazon]. Now that is time well spent.<br /><br />Three stars for the performances of Peter O'Toole as kingly Priam, Eric Bana as thoughtful Hector and Saffron Burrows as his lovely wife, and a nod to the chemistry between Achilles [ Pitt ] and Brisies [ Rose Byrne ].
B008NCSZQ8|4.0|Kind of a weak and predictable plot, but enough action to keep you engaged. Worth warching if you dont have to pay
B0034DGPEU|5.0|Grissom captures the horror, brutality, and degradation of American slavery.  This is a well researched, edgy historical novel, written by a Canadian who moved to Virginia.  Her perspective is fresh and heartfelt.  She gets a lot of the talk and the dynamics of the Old South with the outsider curiosity of a de Tocqueville. Her descriptions of physical settings, choices of moments to convey, portraits of her characters, and sense of flow  made for a deep journey for readers. I couldn't put the book down.
B003LQ3YXU|4.0|The latest incarnation of the doctor is fun, the graphics are terrific, and the stars are appealing.  What's not to like?
B00G2SIW7M|5.0|Another masterpiece for Arcade Fire.  Our generations best band.  They have stayed true to themselves despite the success.  Just give them another Grammy.
B00G32OER4|5.0|This movie was so scary I couldn't sleep after watching it.  Make sure you don't watch it alone.  I suppose you have to have some belief in spirits and supernatural to find this movie fear provoking, but it was really a good one.  Towards the end it did get a little cheesy, but over all a great watch!
B008OOYALE|1.0|This version of the game has a very glaring flaw: it's incomplete. If you're an Android user, you get half the features and content as the iOS users. This is a fairly dramatic downside, especially when it comes to not having access to the enchanted farms (which are far far more efficient at producing food than the standard large farms, thus making growing your dragons tedious and slow). The fact that we're going on a year without these features being added equally to both platforms shows TeamLava's commitment to Android users, i.e. none whatsoever.
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|This is a fun game but I do not like how play is contingent on having &#34;lives&#34; Makes the game slow for me.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Downton Abbey was recommended to me by a friend and I became addicted very quickly.  Superbly acted and a story line that will not let you stop watching.
1451666179|5.0|I'm not sure where to start with this book...to put it simply, just amazing. I was first introduced to her blog late 2009 by a friend, from then on, I couldn't get a enough! I would always find myself coming back to re-read her stories. Every one of the stories told always makes me laugh. Anyways, ever since I saw that she was going to make a book out of these stories, I knew I had to get it! I just got it today, and I'm a very satisfied customer. I've already read most of the book, and I would recommend this book to anyone who wants a good laugh and look at pretty pictures. Also, Allie, if you read this, thanks for making these stories available to us! Even though these stories are funny, they are your experiences. It takes quite some courage to post it for the world to see, so thanks again for making my day a little brighter. God Bless!
B000SKNIWE|5.0|OMG!  If you haven't seen this series and you love nature - you must buy this and watch it!  Superbly done!
B008JFUQZ2|5.0|I DID NOT SEE THIS MOVE IN THE MOVIE THEATER BUT MY WIFE DID.  SHE SAID IT WAS A MUST TO HAVE IN OUR MOVIE COLLECTION
B00BSZZA3I|4.0|I've had this case for about a month now and I love the convenience of using it as a stand. It also does a great job protecting my phone.<br /><br />I walked outside today in a rush and dropped my phone directly on it's front side on solid concrete. There isn't a scratch on my phone or the case from the impact. The glass did not crack.<br /><br />My only gripe about this case is that the flap blocks the camera lense when trying to take a picture. You have to leave the flap open and not fold it all the way back, which is a bit cumbersome.<br /><br />I would definitely recommend this case to anyone with an HTC One.
B00BEIYMAG|5.0|DID NOT GET TO SEE THIS IN THE MOVIE THEATER.  WAS HAPPY TO SEE THIS BEING OFFERED. HAD TO BUY IT
B00FWAZ87I|5.0|The man never seems to run out of steam.  It will be a much duller musical world when he retires.<br /><br />I love the different approach he took this time.  Bravo maestro.
B009LDD4V4|5.0|HAVE LOVED THIS SHOW EVER SINCE IT STARTED ON TV.  HAVE BOUGHT ALL THE PREVIOUS SEASONS. WAS HAPPY TO RECEIVE THIS SEASON
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I have it for my phone, PC, tablet, iPod, & now my Kindle. Needless to say that I'm very addicted.
B003O86FMW|5.0|It was a wonderful book I loved it and it was a thrilling storyline that had my eye to the page.
B00FOU1O3S|5.0|Very entertaining. Great game. I love it and can spend hours playing this game.can't put it down. It's that good.
B009NH6AOQ|5.0|We love the Walking Dead. The series  keep you on edge. We can't stand it when a main character dies!
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|I chose those rating because it's awesome, it has an awesome adventure and story definitely a book to read for everyone
0439023521|5.0|I bought the whole set for my daughter. She is 25 and she loved them! She really doesn't like to read!
B001NLL8LA|5.0|A chilling hunt for an indomitable creeping terror.<br />All the ingredients of a Jack Reacher story, tenfold.<br />You can hear the the weapons cocking, the bones crunching, and the analytical mind whirring; all juxtaposed against the enshrouding silence of the hunt.<br />Jack Reacher in fine form.
B00ESY7QXI|1.0|Yes, I know - I can't believe I didn't read the book in high school either.  The movie was well done and I enjoyed the dramatic scenery.  It was like a cheerful Tim Burton.  However, there just isn't much you could do with the story.  If you like the story you will probably love the movie.
B004GHNH7Q|5.0|Order came in a timely fashion.  Ordered a used book, the book looks like it has never been read, in perfect condition.
B004QKNXIQ|5.0|Just another great adventure from Disney.  It is a movie the entire family will enjoy.  Some scary parts that end up being funny.  Some suspense that is pretty intense.  Great for children starting somewhere between 4-5 right up to adults.  At least for my kids, all children are different.
B00AYB0TOW|5.0|I loved this movie.... I was on my way home and a gentleman next to me on the plane was playing it.  I got home and had to see it.  Great movie.... can you recommend others like it?
B006G3JPWO|5.0|This movie is worth seeing for how campy it is. I can't believe I never saw this as a child. Seriously. What were my parents thinking?!?!? BOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOK!!!!
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|For a puzzle game I was very pleased with this game. Graphics aesthetic, puzzles not tedious or mundane. Take a minute to think before clicking on the hint button. Completely worth it all around.
B00FWAZ87I|5.0|Who wouldn't pay 7 bucks for an Ayreon double album? Sure, it was leaked a couple of weeks ago, but again- 7 bucks to support a dude who is doing awesome things.
B0019N8P2W|5.0|I was so happy to see this on AMAZON! I loved Daria and this set is just perfect. The only disappointment is that the original music is gone :-( but that's not enough to prevent one from enjoying the show.
B008V8FVTI|5.0|this movie was a little hard to watch at first because of the abuse the four suffered while doing time at the wilkins home for boys...but fast forward twenty plus years later and the avenge would prove to be satisfying...I can honestly said with out a doubt that to watch Kevin Beacon play the part of a sadistic officer was a bit disturbing to me ... I couldn't watch anything with him in it for a while...that's how you know the actor was that convincing in the part he played ... well done Mr. Beacon....story line was great acting was great...good watch
B0045INOD8|5.0|An older movie, but in no way dated, except that the explosions and helicopters are real and not computer generated. But this is an excellent movie, and really not much about the Vietnam War.  About the wages of sin.
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|Found it very useful when I was too lazy to set up my other alarm clock after the power went out.
B00BD99JMW|1.0|I love the first two books in this series so much so that I reread them this summer and preordered Allegiant for my Kindle. I admit I had high hopes for the final book. But even with my high expectations, Veronica Roth did not deliver a quality story. The plot was alternately confusing and boring, giving no real depth to the characters that we have come to love. Halfway through I actually thought that maybe Roth had decided to add more books to the series and that Allegiant would just be a filler until we could get to the real action. Unfortunately this did not happen and I was left extremely disappointed in a series that had so much potential.
B00E7Z7D2M|3.0|Let's first state the facts here. Black Radio 2 is not bad music. Robert Glasper can't make a bad song because he's just way too talented. The problem is clear. This album is just lazy and heartless. Though I think Jill Scott was produced correctly. I think Brandy and Dwele were both severely under-produced. I don't know what the hell Snoop was on. The band was playing as if everyone's name was Quest Love. Simple, basic and lifeless. Plus there are too many songs on this album and most of them sound the same.<br /><br />Congratulations to Robert. Black Radio 2 is so dumbed down musically that everyone in the band is now way over qualified for the gig. He can now fire those guys and become the Kim Burrell of r&b/jazz by showing up to everyone's city and using local musicians for cheap. Even church cats can play this gig now.<br /><br />Chris Dave and the Drumhedz are smashing this group right now. As well as Snarky Puppy and Dirty Loops. Hopefully this band will wake up and get back to musically murdering cats. Until then, I'll continue cleaning the house and praying softly to Black Radio 2.
B005ZUR724|1.0|I just bought this app, now I can't play it. It keeps saying &quot;Checking Current Update&quot; Then gives me a message saying that I'm not connected to the Internet and wont let me play. What's going on?
B00ELOOYZI|5.0|Very fun to play and experiment with. The possibilities of what you can do making rockets and traveling between planets makes the replay value insane! One of the best free apps I've gotten through Amazon.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This game is awsome i love it its fun and addictive i love to play it when were going on a trip and im stuck in the car or when im bored and its Freee !!! :)
B00DHKKN6Q|5.0|Nice game to play. My granddaughter enjoys this game too. I just play until I run out of moves. Nice.
B004J4WLB4|5.0|I belong to a book club and this was on our list.  Could not put it down!  I enjoyed learning how to communicate with the use of flowers. It is interesting to see how in past years the important of communicating with flowers was to the romantic part of people lives.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Stephen King never disappoints. I often wondered what happened to Danny the little boy in The Shining.  Now I know. This is a very scary book and if you enjoy reading the King stories, you will love this one.
B00A3NQNUU|3.0|Except that it really wouldn't let me play without sharing and gifting on Facebook, which I didn't want to do.
0689835604|5.0|I like this book very much. It is very interesting for baby. Very simple and cool book! Great pictures inside!<br />But I bought it used with acceptable quality and some of pages were teared off :(  Will buy just new books next time
B006FTC6ZC|5.0|I found this by accident, but enjoyed it immensely.  I would recommend this to anyone that enjoys silly comedies like me.
B007LGPSX0|1.0|CBS  ruined this show when they put them on DVD..The music from the original soundtrack was replaced with corny no name music...Also Amazon has the episodes in the wrong order..the titles are wrong on some of the shows..Also Amazon only streams the first season..They need to offer them all!!!
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Lots of fun and challenge. My favorite game to play. Not happy that time keeps ticking when it reshuffles. Also it now appears si have been charged when sending lives yo friends.
B00D4PDJMY|4.0|Disappointed thought it would be better..In fact I'm sure he can...but its nice to hear..better luck next time I guess
1401224806|2.0|...I'm willing to bash it when it's not up to par, and Werewolves of the Heartland isn't even close. I was really excited for this but the story is dull, the art is bland, and the writing isn't anywhere near as good as Fables usually is. Don't feel like you are missing out on anything if you don't have this in your Fables collection. At least it wasn't as bad as the atrocious Fables Crossover with The Literals.
B00FI7XBIS|5.0|I really like this app and suggest It!!! If the game gets to hard, keep going! I got it for app of the day for free but even if it was not I still suggest it! Rate it a 5!
B00846REIS|5.0|I loved this series!!! I thought it had a wonderful story line. So many twists and turns. I recommend this series. I like to read a book for my own enjoyment.  I don't read to criticize.
B00EY8BRGU|2.0|Great idea that was produced by elementary school film students.  I understand 'suspension of disbelief' but one would have to be an idiot to accept this story and outcome. May it disappear...please.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|I received my Chromecast about a month ago and just love it.  I've used it mostly for Netflix and I'm totally enjoying being able to stream to my flat screen from my tablet without tying up my computer or running wires.  Picture quality is outstanding.  Installation was a breeze.  I've found I can also watch videos from my iTunes collection by just dropping the file into an open Chrome tab. All in all it's everything I had hoped for and will only get better as they add support for more apps.
0385349947|5.0|I really liked this book. Sheryl Sandberg has lead a very interesting life and she shares a lot of what she has faced along the way. She offers concrete suggestions for how to handle many situations that young professionals are likely to encounter.  I gave this book to all my daughters friends at graduation, as I would have loved to have this book when I was their age.  I found the book a fast read.  Very readable.
B00F8L2VO4|5.0|I teach French and Spanish to middle schoolers and just got them hooked on this app. They love it! It's good to compete and to encourage them to push themselves in the language. I absolutely love this app!
B00DR0PDNE|2.0|Uses were too limited. Though I would be able to stream everything.<br />Not so. Only YouTube and Amazon. No Thanks.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This is a great game. It's easy and its fun. It's really cool and I feel in love with it
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This is a very good game. Needs to be longer. Very challenging as you move up the levels.  Waiting for updates soon
B00F2HW220|5.0|This album is quite an accomplishment.  Musically, it's some of the strongest stuff Arjen has produced, and like all excellent prog, it improves with age.  I'm on my fifth or sixth listen, and I find myself enjoying it more and more each time.  It seems structured a bit differently than previous Ayreon albums.  Were it not for the annoying little breaks between tracks (possibly produced by cloud player), I would think the entire album was one long song (maybe a little more like the Electric Castle than, say, Human Equation).  I think this is the most cohesive and consistent of all the Ayreon albums, but it is also full of diverse styles and sounds.  Mingling with progressive metal are some really excellent Irish and eastern riffs.  Arjen puts his guest musicians to good use, with the keyboards being especially notable.  I enjoyed the vocals, but with a few exceptions, I never fell in love with them in the same way that I did with some previous albums.  Complaints?  The story is interesting, but I admit, I miss the epic nature of the Forever storyline.  I hope Arjen continues to develop and expand the story he's started here in subsequent albums.<br /><br />How does it compare to previous Ayreon albums?  That's hard to say; they're all pretty distinct experiences.  As I said before, I think this album is unusually cohesive and consistent.  I usually say that the complete Universal Migrator is my favorite, but when it comes to Ayreon, my favorite is usually whichever I'm listening to at that moment.<br /><br />Update 11/4/2013 - Got my physical copy in the mail, and it's surprising what an improvement the CD is over the autorip.  I might rip the whole thing myself as a single FLAC.  The making-of DVD is also highly entertaining and full of interesting tidbits.  If you're trying to decide between buying the CD or just the MP3, I highly suggest getting a physical copy.  I'm a cloud-music junkie, and this is the first CD I've bought in years, but it's worth it.  This isan album made for CD.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|had to buy this when my first kindle wouldn't work with original power cord.  This one didn't power it up either and I ended up getting a new kindle.  this works great with the new one.
B00G32VYDG|2.0|Very few and far between funny moments, tired old-same-ole-same-ole  &#34;theme&#34; . Wait till it's a $0.99 movie rental. Amazon why do i need long winded reviews.
B00G2SIW7M|4.0|Keep in mind, I'm old, so not the demographic you would expect.  But the fact that they have Bowie on the title track was enough to get me interested.  The price for the download was right as well.  I've only listened to the album once, and on perusing the tracks everything sounded somewhat the same, until you got to the second disc.  Maybe I'm just in that kind of a mood, but the main track is very infectious.  You don't even notice it's over 7 minutes long.  That's my idea of a great song, when you get so wrapped up in it, it seems way too short.  The last track, which is over 11 minutes in length is the same way.  I don't have the physical album, so can't discuss who plays what on what, but when finances improve, I plan on exploring more of this band!
B009LDD1X0|5.0|I think season 6 overall was the funniest and we watched the entire season in a few days because the shows were so good.
B004JMY312|5.0|We were away from home this year so downloaded this movie on a relatives PC. Poor quality of streaming was a huge disappointment. Almost stopped watching several times, it was so bad. The movie itself is a classic. It's not Halloween without watching Hocus Pocus.
B00821OX98|5.0|Got me hooked. Just as I thought there would not be much more out comes another surprise in the last episode of season 1.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I'm hooked. Didn't think I would be, but, I was wrong. I couldn't stop playing. My friend told me this would happen and it did. Great game.
0763644765|5.0|My grandson loves this book. Hopefully, he will potty train without much difficulty! Has short sentences for his short attention span. Very readable and to the point.
B00BFV1K2A|5.0|Absolutely enthralling. I read the entire trilogy in eight days!! If you like the movies you will love the books.
B005K17RU0|5.0|The first thing I do when I wake up each day is check the weather on this app. I'm amazed at how accurate the weather is. I wanted to check the forecast yesterday for Halloween trick-or-treating so I checked the hourly forecast. Rain was predicted at 6pm. I'll be darned if it didn't start drizzling at 5:57pm. This app is also very easy to use.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|Watching all the Youtube videos on a big screen TV<br />Enabled all my PC and Andrio devices to control my TV<br />Great price and easy to install
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Crazy game but I love it!<br />Addicting but fun!<br />Thanks for making it free.<br />Love the sound effects and the special effects.
B005LAIIN0|5.0|Action, drama and good language.  Love it.  There are no other words to describe how  much I enjoy it!!!! Great.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|challenging. addicting, lots of crazy levels, once you start it is very hard to put down. some levels you really have to look ahead
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|This was an interesting book.  It took a while to weave the characters' stories so you could understand their relationships to each other.  The author did a good job of keeping the reader's interest in the story and not getting too bogged down with any one character.  I would recommend this book to anyone looking for a light read, with a moral ending.
1451666179|5.0|I ordered this book months ago and when I got it it's was the most amazing surprise. I love her blog and the book is now something I can show to everyone so they can fall in love with Allie too!! I also cannot count how many stories relate to my life!
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|what happens to the free levels after you accept them from a face friend.  Could you tell us with more information.-
B00BWYFTNG|5.0|I ordered this for my husband who is a true Walking Dead fanatic!!  When he made out his Christmas list recently, the item at the top of his list was this!!  I'm thrilled to have gotten it!!  Thank you!!
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|Never been able to get it to work. I have a netgear router  that is not custom configured st all. Have called Google support, they tell me to call netgear which has no idea what to do to make it work. Plus it now it does less than my ps3. Not needed.
B008QYT7DI|1.0|This purchase was extremely disappointing and I will be pursuing every avenue to cancel it. The limited platforms supported is ridiculous, along with zero visibility to the platforms supported at time of purchase.  All in all pretty STUPID!!!!! packaging of what might have been an enjoyable purchase.
B008Q0AP2E|5.0|I HAVE WATCHED THIS MOVIE SEVERAL TIMES OVER THE YEARS AND CONTINUE TO ENJOY THE VISUALS. This movie made me read all the Rice novels...mother and son!
B005EGXSWW|4.0|I enjoyed this book, but the exploits of Harry Hole are becoming a bit over the top and not very believable.
1439152799|5.0|Love this book, almost as good as The Forgotten Garden.  She tells a wonderful story from beginning to end.<br />Thanks
B003B02O0A|3.0|Some books are just made for reading on your trip from DC to Chicago (if you skim the boring parts). When you get to Chicago, you can drop it in the recycle bin and forget it. No one is better then Grisham writing this kind of book. The critics would have you believe that he is producing something quite profound. Not true. There is a glimmer of a good idea stretched to the maximum to create a full length novel. Most of it is boring repetitious filler. It's kind of like writing a good B movie year after year. The books are fun to read. Why make more of it then that?
B00F99EMRE|4.0|This album has always been (over 10 years) the one album that kind of got away from them.  I mean, it doesn't really have those great sounding keyboard parts and the guitars are sort of muddied and abstract, even sounding missing in some parts.<br /><br />However, this 'Remix' of the dogged 2002 original 'Vapor Trails' which came out this October 2013, is remarkably a better sounding and almost differently, altogether, sounding album.<br /><br />They have added vocal lines, where before, they were inaudible.  As well, some guitars have resurfaced, from inaudibility.<br /><br />The difference in just these two areas, makes this album a lot better and newer to the ear, certainly well worth purchasing.  I was skeptical about buying this CD, but all of my skepticism, was cleared away after 1 or 2 listens.  Now, I find that I am really liking this CD, 'Vapor Trails,' in a way that I like every Rush album.  In summary, if you like the band, you probably would want this version to listen to, as it is easier on the ears, in fact, it sounds great, in comparison.  This CD is an essential supplement to every Rush fan's collection.  Don't miss this release!
0316219266|5.0|I am a big fan of Amazon and, of course, Jeff Bezos, as he created Amazon. Compared to the book &#34;One Click,&#34; which is also about Bezos and Amazon, this book is much more detailed and up-to-date. While I read the book, I imagine what it would have been to be  Bezos about 20 years ago. It is pretty incredible what he did, how he did it. Some anecdotes makes me laugh on a subway (I read this book while commuting to work by taking metro).<br /><br />If you liked &#34;One Click,&#34; you will love this book even more.
B00F8OUBXE|5.0|This CD is simplistic in Cover-Art, but that shouldn't factor what-so-ever in the metal sounding triumph that this CD embodies.  I rated this CD at 5 stars because it is great in texture and great in skill and great in feel.  They put out consistently great metal albums from the 1st, 'Metal Church', right through to their latest offering, 'Generation Nothing.'  I find that this album is not over-simplistic in form and the drums are very intricate on a lot of the offerings, yet, don't waver into over-complexity, like some metal albums do.  These guys have kept a simple formula over their near 30 year career, that of straight-ahead rocking out metal that is easy on the ears and very easy to get into.  I'd recommend this offerning from Oct. of 2013 to anyone who likes metal music that comes from the heart and not so much simply fast or overdrawn.  Pick this album up, you will not be disappointed!  Let the metal flow through you!!!!!
B005HEDI3K|5.0|Growing up, television in our home was decided by &#34;Boy Days&#34; and &#34;Girl Days.&#34; The problem was that there were three girls and only one boy. As the youngest of the lot, I had to choose between watching what was on or going outside. One of my vivid memories was being tortured by this show. My brother was  a HUGE &#34;Star Trek&#34; fan and as a result, every other day James Kirk and Spock would visit us in our living room on our tube TV with the large console and the small screen. Then there was the game of turning the antenna to find the right spot where you could see movement on the screen through the blizzard of &#34;snow&#34; interference.<br /><br />My husband and I sat down to watch TV, and just for fun, I selected this show and watched his reaction. He snickered at first, but before we knew it we were both transported in time visiting with our old friends once again. I will say that Kirk and Spock haven't aged a bit! In fact, with the digital remaster, we could see them much more clearly with vivid color and no snow! We were also quite impressed with the special effects of the 1960s. Very enjoyable!

B008JFUNHI|3.0|For an immeasurable amount of time, books have been a cornerstone of Hollywood's production of films.  In fact, your favorite movie is likely based on a novel or at the very least inspired by some piece of literature.  Popular books, including The Godfather, Jurassic Park, and The Lord of the Rings trilogy have all been adapted to film and translated so well they garnered heavy critical acclaim - not to mention they've changed the way films are produced.  On the other hand, while the highly praised novel-to-film adaptions stick out in a noteworthy manner, so do the novels that have been adapted that have turned out to be downright horrible.  In recent memory, Eragon, Percy Jackson: Sea of Monsters, and The Mortal Instruments: City of Bones are just the tip of the iceberg in the category of film adapted \\"flops.\\"  Now, there are some that sit in the fields of gray - being moderately presentable and somewhat entertaining, like the newest vision of The Great Gatsby or basically any one of the Twilight films.  Still, novel-to-film adaptions appear to be risky business, especially when a novel has critical acclaim of its own merit, along with a legion of diehard followers.  So, is the newest novel-to-film adaption, Ender's Game, a praise-worthy flick or just another forgettable Hollywood production?<br /><br />Based on the novel of the same name written by Orson Scott Card and directed by Gavin Hood (X-Men Origins: Wolverine), Ender's Game stars Asa Butterfield as Andrew \\"Ender\\" Wiggins - a young prodigy training to become a potential commander in the International Fleet to protect humanity against an alien species called the Buggers.  Handpicked by Colonel Graff (Harrison Ford), Ender must work his way to the top of the command chain, and if Graff is correct, Ender might just be humanity's last hope.  However, before he can achieve his ultimate goal, Ender must earn the respect of his peers, including fellow classmates and teammates Petra Arkanian (Hailee Steinfeld), Bonzo (Mois&eacute;s Arias), and Bean (Aramis Knight).  Ben Kingsley, Viola Davis, and Abigail Breslin also star in supporting roles.<br /><br />Let's get this straight first - as this is not a comparison to the novel.  The book clearly stands on its own as one of the more admired novels in sci-fi lore, which also won several prominent awards since its debut as a full novelization in 1985 (it started as a short story in 1977).  Why it took so long for this book to be adapted to film is a bit of a head scratcher in itself.  Also, there is no need to discuss the often and sometimes offensive views of author Orson Scott Card.  If you don't know what I'm talking about, feel free to look it up - but the work of director Gavin Hood will not be judged even remotely based Card's moralistic or political views.<br /><br />MINOR SPOILERS FROM HERE...<br /><br />The film's star, Asa Butterfield is certainly the outstanding star in this epic space adventure.  Most recognizable from his leading role in Hugo, Butterfield does his best impression of Hugh Laurie's House and Benedict Cumberbatch's Sherlock Holmes - quickly dissecting individuals and attempting to sell himself as basically the smartest person alive.  For the most part, Butterfield is acceptable as a strategy \\"wizard,\\" but he's not anyone's ideal image of a savior.  In fact, at times he shows shades of Hayden Christenson as a bit of sniveling little brat that's difficult to like, mainly because of his attempt to act as though he's better than everyone else.  But, as the film progresses, his emotional journey will allow for much more viewer compassion - all leading up towards an emotional climax and eventually his final exchange with Harrison Ford's character.  This heated back-and-forth dialogue is the film's screen-stealer and most memorable interaction.<br /><br />To its complete benefit, Ender's Game has one of the greatest actors in the history of film lending his skillset in a supporting role to the young star - thatbeing savvy film vet, Harrison Ford.  From the moment the story begins, Ford's character is there pulling the strings - even though he appears to be doing so at first in desperation for humanity's future existence.  As the film progresses, he takes more and more of an interest into the mindset and specific actions of young Ender - almost like a Emperor Palpatine to Darth Vader relationship (yes, there's my one Star Wars reference).  For those that are familiar with the book, you know the road this relationship ends up traveling down - but for the people like me that haven't read the book, the end result of their relationship leads to a significant dilemma and many, many questions.  Was Graff ultimately doing the right thing for humanity?  Would a child have the capability and mental angst to do what was necessary to take down aliens?  Is Ender anything other than a patsy?  Was he too smart for his own good?<br /><br />The series of questions above lead to the major hang-ups of this film, which turns out to be the actual story progression itself.  Obviously, in order to find any sort of enjoyment in this film you literally have to take all sensibility and logic and just flat-out ignore it.  The fate of humanity is supposedly at stake and a child is in charge of the entire battle fleet?  Come on, that's a pretty wild stretch of the imagination - and maybe I'm being a bit ignorant here, but why aren't adults being trained to command the fleet?  Why doesn't humanity's previous hero, Mazer Rackham, portrayed by the always mesmerizing Sir Ben Kingsley, volunteer to take on the aliens once again?<br /><br />Overall, Ender's Game is an average human vs. alien film with stunning sound and visuals.  How it compares to the novel is for other people to decide, but as a standalone film, Ender's Game is an entertaining coming-of-age story - despite it being mostly predictable and occasionally self-serving.  However, the progressive training of Ender's character and Mighty Duck-like relationship building is where the real enjoyment and drama of this film lies.  And to be honest, after seeing the opening moments of the film, it's hard not to see the reflection of Independence Day, especially in the opening battle where one pilot's sacrifice saves humanity.  It begs the question:  are alien invasion stories getting stale?  Regardless and for the most part, Gavin Hood has created a film that will appease fans of the book, moderately entertain causal moviegoers, and possibly even encourage those of us who don't know much about Ender to get into the series.<br /><br />GRADE:  C<br />FNDNreview.comsavvy film vet, Harrison Ford.

B00BD99JMW|1.0|Everything in this book would make any child not want to study science, be it biochemistry or a social science.  Everything she based the book on is either impossible or just ridiculous.  DNA is not altered by behavior, period, and that is the basis for the book.  What a terrible ending!!
B004HWYTP4|5.0|I have seen this a half dozen times, but I rented it again to watch it with my wife before seeing Red 2 at the show.  The sequel is even better. Waiting for the director's cut twin pack if/when it comes out.
B00DYCHPMC|5.0|It goes without saying, this is a wonderful treat for longtime fans.  Back in 1984, I think that I listened to this album at least once a day for over a year.  I was a fan from then on and while my musical tastes have broadened through the years, this album has remained a staple in my collection.  The box set includes a disc of b-sides and remixes, all neatly compiled onto a disc so that I no longer need to flip through my old vinyl.  The disc of \\"live sessions\\" is great. I had not heard them before.  And finally there is a copy of \\"In My Minds Eye\\" which I had only seen once on a VHS tape and more recently through clips on YouTube.  All in all, this is a great package.  A mini time capsule if you will.  Something that would hopefully introduce a new generation of fans to what I consider to be one of the most under appreciated bands of the 1980's an 90's.  And yes I include the 90's because in case you missed it, they put out great albums after the first three Lps as we'll.  As a fan, I can only dream and hope that each of them get a proper \\"Deluxe\\" treatment.

B003H4I4JU|4.0|Good gollow up to ender's game. this was the book that made me realize its more about interactions then space battles
158270208X|5.0|This is such a cool little journal, awesomely put together with the fold over magnetic flap closure and it was still in the original plastic wrapped then wrapped in bubble wrap and packed very well and then processed very quickly.  Anyone who is looking for a cool journal that has some awesome affirmations on the pages need look no further!
B0073COMUW|3.0|I got this bulb with some skepticism based on the previous reviews. I got the package on time (thanks Amazon). I ordered 10 bulbs and eight of them were fine. One never lit up out of the box and the other went out in the first 5 minutes. These have a 20% failure rate which tells me they don't have Quality Control on this product.<br /><br />Now coming to the working bulbs, the light is awesome (nice bright day light - white). However the light is not 360 degrees but more directional. If you have it in the overhead fixtures you will be fine, but if you plan to have them in the lamps (like the other reviewer said) you will have a problem.<br /><br />I used them all for the overhead fixtures and restrooms in the house and am very pleased. I took out 1 star for the poor quality and the other star for directional light.

B0040QYROK|5.0|This Blu-Ray set is absolutely astonishing on two enormous levels.  Firstly, that it even exists.  For anyone who is familiar with Metropolis, you know that the story of its editing, like many films of the era, is one of giant cuts without any thought to the preservation of the &#34;deleted&#34; scenes.  There simply was no home media in the 1920s so anything that hit the chopping block was, in many cases, gone forever for the sake of eliminating running time and getting as many people into the cinema throughout the day as possible.  From its original release to present, the deleted scenes were simply lost or destroyed and it was accepted that a complete cut of Metropolis simply would never materialize.<br /><br />Somehow a complete 16mm duplicate of the original 35mm negative was discovered in the late 2000s and Kino went through the arduous task of restoring it.  It was in rough shape, to say the least.  But the result is what we have on this disc.  A nearly complete version of Metropolis.  Some scenes, in which the film was simply too damaged, were not included however detailed intertitles explain the story elements.  As for the newly discovered scenes, the jump from crystal clear 35mm film stock to the 16mm material is jarring but, for a film that was released and edited in the '20s, its simply amazing that it exists, was located and reunited with the original material.<br /><br />As for the film itself, it's commonly accepted that the it is the first sci-fi film.  Period.  Metropolis has influenced the likes of Blade Runner and Star Wars, amoung a laundry list of movies that have been released afterward.  The Blu-Ray presentation is crystal clear and the orchestral soundtrack is performed in accordance with the original's live accompanying composition.<br /><br />Fantastic film and a definite purchase for any sci-fi fan.

B00E6887H0|5.0|This is Ry doing what he does best. Mixing in music that you wouldn't normally put on the same album. To me, he is the Patron Saint of Un-Lettered Ethnomusicologists. Look at the genres of music and the variety of musicians he has played with over the past 40 years. A small sample: Buena Vista to V.M. Bhatt, Ronstadt to Rolling Stones, Farka Toure to Taj Mahal and on and on. So, here is a live album with back catalog classics, new songs, r and b,blues, Nortena, folk trad, and Banda. Be honest boys and girls...have you heard or know what Banda music is?  I am lucky to call Ry my friend.A few years ago,he invited me to East L.A. to hear Banda music. I thought the motels in that part of town were damn reasonable at signboard prices of $15-$25. Till I realized that they were \\"per hour\\" rates.Yes, were in that part of town. The club we went to had La Banda Juvenil in the marquee. They consisted of 3 trumpets,2 bones, 2 saxes,a marching bass drum, a marching snare, a tuba and two singers. And, they were miked in a club that held maybe 150 people. Blown away was an understatement. At the break, the leader introduced and thanked Ry for coming out. I could feel the wheels spinning. And here they are tonite along with Flaco Jimenez (2013 NEA award winner). Along with the fab  soulful vocals of Terry Evans and Arnold McCuller. And what about Juliette Commagere? She kills it on Volver Volver. (Trivia: Joachim Cooder's bandmate from their high school days)  Joachim is no gimmick either.The treble clef didn't fall far off the music stand did it?  And trusty Robert Francis smokin bass line keeps everyone's heads bobbing. This is a live album. You get Ry yakking story after story between the cuts. Pulls it all together. Now go play this friggin' loud on your best system,arm around your baby, cold beer or smoke nearby. And suddenly, all is well in the world.

B00BD99JMW|4.0|After waiting a year and a half Allegiant has finally came out!! I really did like this book for many different reasons while some scenes I did not like. Veronica Roth has amazed me with her writing since the beginning with Divergent (one of my favorite books). I am sad to  see this series grow because I got so connected with the characters and the action. Tris and Four are characters that I will forever re-read over and over again. Veronica's writing was intense and full of suspense as we got to see the operations of the fractions. I never read any of the spoilers so I went into Allegiant head first and discovered why I did love this series.<br /><br />It picks up right after Insurgent, after discovering who is Edith Prior is in the video. Allegaint really opens up more about the history of the fractions as well as the Allegiant's. While I was about to cry through some parts of the book it did start off slow to me. Allegiant showed us the people beyond the wall. Like the other books there are many sacrifices the characters go through to get to the end. Veronica Roth did a great job representing who Tris really is and her discovering who she really is. After reading on Veronica's site about the ending I felt it does fit the book perfectly. While others can be mad about the book remember that it remains true to the characters and what they did in every book.<br /><br />Tobia's character point of view really changes throughout the book. I felt that Roth made Tobia's more of a depressing character the entire novel. I did like his views because we got to see a different part of him and his fears through his eyes. He was more distant with Tris at times but it was more understandable once you read  Allegiant. The plot about the outside world beyond Chicago was really interesting because we learned more about Tris' mom and how she came to Dauntless etc.<br /><br />Overall the book was a good read, and it still has me thinking about the book to this day. There is so many questions that I would love to get answered but Veronica successfully did that with this book. It had a good ending that made me feel like crying and satisfied with what happened. I look forward to many other peoples reactions and thoughts after reading this final book in the Divergent series, but the first book will always be my favorite. Thank you Veronica Roth for creating this series and making the series one of my favorites. I will definitely be reading future books by this author!estions that I would love to get answered but Veronica successfully did that with this book.

B003G4W49C|5.0|Orson Scott Card has mastered the art of characterization, and this shows in Ender's Game.  The main character desires to be accepted and loved for who he is, but society and authority either reject him outright or see him as an object to be manipulated. Yet the fate of humanity rests on his young shoulders. Aware of both rejection and manipulation, the young Ender nevertheless strives to master the single option open to him, to become the weapon his world needs and expects. Ender and his classmates are all children with a child's acceptance of their fate and yet with intellects that allow them to perceive the dark motivations of the adults around them. While Card pushes the boundary of belief that intellect rises above emotional need in his young characters, still the story is compelling. Card lets the reader experience the brutal consequences of total war on both the victor and the vanquished. Ender's Game is a dark tale told well.

B00ANVX6DY|4.0|The product came on time. I'm a prime member so i received it in the 2 days specified. No delays at all.  nicely packaged. No damages what so ever. The only reason i did not give this a 5 star is that there is a sticker on the DVD that states &#34;Includes FREE princess in Training Activity Kit with Stickers & Tiaras&#34;.  Now when i ordered the product, the description was for a DVD only.  But if you are going to describe it as such, then the sticker should have been removed prior to deliver or i am going to think that something is not amiss. It does not matter to me that the seller is perhaps selling the activity kit separately, but now that i know it should have came with the DVD it annoys me.
