B004UBW9SG|5.0|My husband and I very much enjoy listening to books on CD while traveling.  This is the second Castle book and we love the detail and sense of humor along with solving the mystery.  The book arrived in good time an good shape.
B002N5N5LG|5.0|The show itself is great.  There are great special features (especially the cast evaluations) and commentary on most of the episodes.  Dan Harmon is great and I'm excited to see where season 3 goes!
1439152780|2.0|I've read two other books by Kate Morton and enjoyed both of them which is why I purchased this one.  It was a disappointment. The story took entirely way too long to develop and once it started to unfold was overdone. None of the characters created were especially compelling. Maybe it was because I wasn't terribly interested in the story but it changes time periods way too often to make it easy to follow. Once the story started to unfold it got interesting but not everyone has the patience to wait until they are 3/4 of the way through. Skip this one and go for one of Morton's others.
B005MVJM3I|5.0|Another great album from Machine Head, a band that continues to get better with each album.  That's right, I'm calling this one BETTER than The Blackening, one of the best metal albums of the 00's.  Buy the deluxe edition: The Sentinel & The Witch Hunt are alone worth the extra $2, but the acoustic version of Darkness Within is just gorgeous.  Every song here fleshes itself out to amazing depth & sound, I cannot wait to hear a few of these songs live.  Do your metal soul a favor and get this album; it will howl with joy.
B00000J7RZ|4.0|On the 6 was actress and dancer Jennifer Lopez's vehicle for music stardom, and it does come across as a bit of a vanity project. The album is shamelessly calculated, boasting the best producers and background singers money could buy in 1999, but Lopez herself proves she has the goods to be a pop star. She's no powerhouse vocalist, but her voice is often expressive and is versatile enough to mesh well with several different styles, including uptempo R&B, salsa, and bittersweet ballads. Those uptempo R&B tracks, like \\"It's Not that Serious\\" and the hit single \\"If You Had My Love,\\" are usually the best this record has to offer, but some of the ballads, like the Latin-influenced cuts \\"Should've Never\\" and \\"Could this be Love,\\" are beautiful. \\"Promise Me You'll Try,\\" on the other hand, sounds like it was produced in 1989 instead of 1999. Two tracks appear twice in alternate forms, typical of a pop album that is too long and somewhat unfocused. \\"No Me Ames,\\" a duet with Marc Anthony (in which J. Lo impressively holds her own), works well as a ballad but is awkward in its \\"Tropical Remix,\\" while \\"Waiting for Tonight\\" is equally enjoyable in English and Spanish. Ultimately, On the 6 is a classy pop album with enough R&B and Latin influence to set Jennifer Lopez apart from many of the other pop stars of the time. 3.5 Stars.
0817439390|5.0|This book is written very well and has helped me as a beginning photographer.  I like how the book contains many photo examples with a small write-up on how it was done.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|I use it every day. It does exactly what it's supposed to do, and it does it well. I like that it allows for a gentle wakeup.
0060591714|3.0|La segunda parte de las Memorias del &aacute;guila y el jaguar es menos emocionante que su predecesora y aunque el mensaje ecol&oacute;gico y anti tecnol&oacute;gico sigue presente, la prosa de este libro se siente menos pulida. La aventura esta ahi, pero esta ves Allende intenta hacer una especie de thriller al estilo Dan Brown que hace que el relato desmerezca junto a La ciudad de las Bestias.
B000002AGN|3.0|Dear Amazon. I have generally been quite pleased with the books and music that you or your affiliates have sent. However, the Time Out CD seemed just a wee bit too fast. I listened to it many many times as an album, it was the signature music of my later teenage years. May I exchange it? Thank you, Grace Clark
B0052GACNM|5.0|The whole album is amazing! Had the privilege of seeing Tony live last March and his voice is still fantastic as this CD shows.. what a performer and a true musical legend! All the duets are awesome!
B005D0RDIE|5.0|I saw part of this show on VH1 tonight. It was part of their Rush Hashanah celebration. It reminded me that Rush is still a freaking awesome band after all these years.  The band was flawless and the crowd was electric. The VH1 telecast lasted 2 1/2 hours. I'm sure the DVD is quite a bit longer than 60 minutes. I will definitely buy this DVD when it is released. Just Moving Pictures from start to finish would be worth the purchase price.
0920668372|1.0|This book chugs along at a decent clip, but becomes more disturbing with every page. I kind of knew it was coming, but when I turned the page and saw A GROWN MAN IN HIS MOTHER'S LAP, I had such a fit of giggles, I almost fell off of the bed. Seriously: this woman drives across town, with a ladder on her truck, to creep up the side of her son's house and into his room??? He is a grown man and she is holding him in her lap? (oedipal aside: excuse me while I gouge out my own eyes) This is not a healthy image of love or parental boundaries.
0061122416|4.0|Manages to avoid being overly sentimental or cliched. The lessons to be learned are nothing that we have not heard before, and yet they are told in such a lyrical way that we can't help but pay attention and be moved by this lovely story.
B0039V8NJC|4.0|More than any well-researched article you may read, this haunting and oddly frightening piece of fiction will give you insight into the dynamic that can turn a Western-educated Muslim from a rising star on Wall Street into a coordinator of jihadist efforts. The writing is deliberately ambiguous and unsettling. New York Times' 100 Notable Books of 2007.
0143038419|4.0|One woman's quest to \\"engineer her own rescue\\" from depression, anxiety, and self-doubt through finding a workable balance between pleasure and spirituality. She is extremely honest, leaving no ugly thought nor any beautiful idea unexplored. She is also a strange mixture of neurotic and adventurous that can alternately seem charming and maddening. She infuses the book with a light humor that is infectious but at times borders on self-congratulation. Her methods can seem extraordinarily self-indulgent, but it's still a good story and most of us have probably wrestled with some of the same demons that she does (although she does seem more susceptible to such preoccupations than most). What I learned from this book is pretty obvious but still nice to confirm: that getting to know ourselves and our spirituality is very difficult yet necessary and ultimately extremely rewarding in ways we can't even imagine.
159448385X|4.0|Like The Hours, this book is remarkable for the way the author gets inside women's heads. There are very few books out there that show the inner life of Afghan women. This is beautifully done, with the bittersweet ending of both hope and tragedy that seems unavoidable when one is dealing with Afghanistan.
B003ZOU5WG|4.0|This book is a gift in every way. It is remarkably suffused with the sweet, gentle spirit of its namesake, along with the infectious enthusiasm of its author. A true original, and a joy to read.
B004XNGKBS|5.0|this app is pretty great. some people here don't like it, that's fine, but shouldn't rate it low. it does exactly what is says it does and very well. I personally enjoy it, just set the milliseconds to  around 145 and you get a great writing experience. sweet job.

B005OT2YVA|3.0|I really want to love this movie, but I can't. This is quiet boring when compared to the last two. There were fightings, racings, and explosion. Things are similiar from last twos. Decepticons threaten the Earth -> Decepticons raise and own everyone -> Decepticons almost reached their goal -> Decepticons got destroyed. The story is nothing new really. I even get lost in the middle of the battle trying to figure out which is which. This is an okay action movie, but nothing wowed me, really.

0345529057|5.0|I have been walking around for most of September with dark circles under my eyes from staying up late reading these books! From the very beginning of A Game of Thrones, I was sucked in and have greedily devoured page after page ever since. I've just started A Feast for Crows and now have ordered the fifth book, A Dance with Dragons. Hopefully it will arrive before I've completed the fourth. George R. R. Martin's words read like you are watching a movie; full of rich details and descriptions that will have you seeing his vivid visions, and cause you to reflect with astonishment that anyone could create so many characters, keep all of their personalities true throughout, and weave so many of their story lines into one large epic tale all tied together so beautifully! I am dreading the end of the fifth book, because the fantasy will have ended. Or will it?
B0058VW36U|5.0|One of the funnest games I have played in a long time.  Starts easy and gets challenging fast.  Lots of different methods and challenges.  Love this game!
B0055V6EZE|4.0|Is every song on this album perfect? No.  Does every song on this album show Hugh Laurie's love for the music?  Absolutely.  Whether you listen to Mr. Laurie or his guest singers, you will know that every song was performed and recorded with love and respect for the traditions of the music.  More than just the love of the music, it's GOOD music.  For one thing, Hugh Laurie's piano playing has always impressed me (even when he's just doodling around on House) and his piano blows me away here.  For another, some of the music on this album is downright nasty sexy good and makes me wanna be naughty!  Four Stars for an awesome first album and a star with room to grow (and I hope he does continue to make this music)!
B003L77G06|5.0|I fell in love with the first season and just had to own the second. Amazon was fast with shipping and I can enjoy any show as I please and rewatching them never gets old.
0385344325|3.0|The timeline here is 1997 and features Reacher in his last job as an MP in the US Army.  It does help in terms of understanding his background and what sets him on the path that would lead to his first adventure depicted in \\"The Killing Floor\\".<br /><br />A murder in a small Mississippi town may have links to a nearby Army base.  To complicate things the troops based there are unofficially engaged in Kosovo and the Army do not want publicity that may highlight the military activity.  Reacher is sent into the town while a colleague is sent into the base and it is not long before Reacher hooks up with the local (female) sheriff who may have her own secrets.<br /><br />As usual it is not long before Reacher works out there is more to the situation, the base is locked down and he is getting mixed messages about what needs to be done and his role in things.<br /><br />There is some familiarity here, Lee Child does tread a well worn path of small town America and Reacher is his usual force of nature. Some more graphic then usual sex scenes and opening up some of Reacher's back-story are a diversion but I felt the story was a little unsatisfying in the end.  There is no 'bad' Reacher novel, but I felt that there was a lot of build up to what was an anti-climax and did leave a few questions unanswered, it almost felt like the author ran out of steam.  Not a bad book, but lacking, I am aware that for some reason slightly marking down a Lee Child book may promote a negative response but I am sorry, he is capable of a lot better than this!
B004ZNAGNE|5.0|I've had many versions of this perennial favorite. Heck, right now I have three versions of the studio release of Pink Floyd's Dark Side of the Moon alone. The original CD version, the 30th Anniversary hybrid SACD and, this, the new 2011 remaster. Although I have yet to hear the MFSL rendition, to me this is the best effort to date for a DSotM CD.   For one thing, thankfully, they didn't compress the music. It's seems to level match fairly well with the other Dark Side CDs I have. Clarity seems to have improved also. It's so clear that it makes the others seem a bit muddied. The great part is not etched. Meaning it sounds smooth while the music is very well defined.   The noise floor seems to be lower on the 2011 remaster than either the original or 30th Ann. That makes the music more dynamic with the quieter background.   Overall the improvements of the 2011 remaster of DSotM are worth getting. The sound differences may not be dramatic but are certainly audible and make this classic even better.   That's only half the story though. The Experience edition comes with the '74 live performance of this great album. THIS is what makes paying the small premium over the Discovery edition well worth it. Not only are the boys in terrific form giving an outstanding show (much better than the Pulse show 20 years later) but the sound quality is amazing. If the original studio version weren't so well known and this 1974 concert album were released years earlier, this could almost have become the definitive version.   Highly recommended just for this CD alone. Add the well done 2011 remaster and it deserves a 5 star rating.
B001HNE3NO|5.0|I thought I knew pretty much about WW2 being that my husband and I both have a passion for learning about this time in history. I was shocked learning about the roundup in France. Shocking not only that it was the French police carrying out orders from the Nazi regime but that they took it even further and rounded up many more children than what was ordered from above. I cannot even write about this story from an unemotional standpoint because of the true events it explores and because it is all so horrific.<br /><br />To point out a few literary standouts, the first I noticed was the parallel between Sarah's and Julia's personality. They both were being discriminated against. Sarah because she was a Jew and Julia because she was an American. Sarah was alway's asking what is wrong with being a Jew? Why were Jews treated so differently? Could you spot a Jew by their looks? Where they really that different? Julia was constantly the butt of her husband's \\"American\\" jokes. People made quick judgements of her because she was an American. Her French friends spoke to her in English even though she had lived in France for most of her life. People made comments to her saying \\"You must be an American\\" in a derogitory tone. However Sarah was much braver than Julia. Sarah hated that her mother was so afraid the first night the French police came. She wanted her mother to stand up and be strong. Sarah carried that strong personality with her throughout the book, which helped in many ways. But in the end, it was too hard for Sarah to be brave. Julia on the other hand doesn't stand tall and defend herself when she is the butt of the American jokes. She holds it all inside until she comes to a breaking point and has to decide who she really is.<br /><br />The author also spends quite a bit of time describing her French characters using stereotypical information about the French. Hold everything in, keep it together, the coldness of the culture, etc... These stereotypes I think are used to help with the story that the French didn't want to unbury the past. They didn't want to remember. These characterizations added to the absolute horror that these people could forget that day in history or even worse that they just didn't want to talk about it or admit it was their police force.<br /><br />I pretty much read this book straight through. I was so caught up in Julia's search that I just couldn't put the book down. This is probably one of the best books I have read all year. It taught me things I never even knew about, it gave me a several different perspectives of one period in time, and the writing was beautiful. I know I will Remember and Never Forget Sarah's Key.the story that the French didn't want to unbury the past. They didn't want to remember.

B005POK858|5.0|This game... how can I explain it... it's a great timewaster. I've spent ALL DAY just to get to about 85% towards the end. Start out, it's hard. Once you have the Gems, you can go all out on bosses. LOVE IT! Sadly, it screws up the 3G and WiFi connections while idle, and also the d-pad is a bit small, so movement is a bit finicky. Other than that, GET IT! Also 1st. :)
B005POK858|1.0|have game on my HTC t-bolt, and it works fine so 5*'s for that, but they don't have support for most tablets 1* for that. get support for all tablets and it will get all 5*'s. but for now 1*.
0307477479|3.0|I enjoyed this book, and it's extraordiarily original format, quite a bit.  Very inventive, but it's really very loosely tied together as far as the plotline goes.  I would like to see more modern books get back to a more traditionaly plotline.  This almost seems like a collection of loosely associated short stories, or a doctoral thesis in English Literature 21st century theory.  Beautifully written, ingeniusouly structured, but the weak plotlines within sometimes drag it down.  That said, I'm now a fan of Jennifer Egan, and will eagerly read more of her work.
B0050QV0RQ|5.0|I got this app for free on the free app of the day and i gotta say i love it, reminds me of FF7. Totally wortg price if u pay for it.
0312576463|2.0|Can someone, hopefully a learned professor of English Literature based in the UK, tell me when well regarded fiction became so self important that it no longer needed to bother with things like narrative, story line, or conflict resolution and decided that character development, of really boring characters, was all that was needed to sustain an incredibly long novel.  This is a meandering mess of book, with no plot line to resolve or conflict to conclude.  It's really just awful.  I won't ever buy another book by Frazen.  I hated the Corrections, but decided to give this a read since it was a gift, and I didn't have time to bring it back and get another book before a very long flight.
B005CAAU76|5.0|Having had this on vinyl,cassette,and cd twice,I was slightly worried how this cd would compare,there was no need,out of all the Queen remasters,this is the best so far,just listen to Mustapha,it is just awesome,sounds like Freddie is in the room with you.  I will say,and this is a problem with all of the current Queen remasters,that the second discs are a missed oppertunity,they have more stuff in the vaults,I mean, a live track from Montreal? surely if you are the kind of fan to spend 17/18 bucks for the remaster,you would already have this concert? but I refuse to deduct it any stars simply because the Remaster is THAT good.  Enjoy and get more of that Jazz....
B003ZSJ212|1.0|Based on the reviews ive seen here, i wont buy it.  Im not a perfectionist and i can deal with minor change here and there, whatever.  But when its this bad of a change, why bother.  Think George Lucas should rethink his ideas, his original first 6 movies were cool.  Now im not a crazy Star Wars but i consider them awesome, i really like it.  But when you make a change, you should be looking on improving.  And i cant see that in this case, which is sad..
0425221806|5.0|Oh em gee. Wish I could find other books that hook me like this one did. It invokes so many emotions, takes you so many different places, feeds your mind in so many ways. Give it a try, if you have any heart at all you won't regret it.
B004SEUJKU|3.0|The edition is ok, just that.  It is nice to have a blu-ray book of this movie, but actually this is the least interesting bd book I have.  Too slim, due to the abscence of a digi tray. The disc is encased in a cardboard on the last cover. Not a big deal of informations either.  However, since there is no steelbook or any other interesting edition (aside from the awfully expensive skull) this is an ok edition, when it's low priced.
B005MW68RK|5.0|To be honest I have all of Joe's music but never heard of Beth Hart.  The best part of this CD was finding HER!  The CD is really great what a dynamic pair!!!

B004SBS8LA|1.0|great game, but I think I will take it off my phone and get the free version from the DROID store. They have ALL the updates and current levels. It really discourages me from downloading any future aps from Amazon, seeing how delayed they are in updating aps that are popular. Especially,  since all the updates have been out for a while.

B0050QV0RQ|5.0|I don't like rpg games but this one is easy for a rpg beginner. Its addictive, awesome, battery drainer game, but I don't care about that because with such great graphics the battery is bound to die. This game is definitely worth the $2.99  :D  though I was one of there lucky one and got it as a free app of the day from Amazon.
0385344325|5.0|I had been waiting impatiently for \\"The Affair\\" to be available as I am a huge fan of the Jack Reacher series, and this book did not disappoint.  In fact, I'm inclined to think that this may be my personal favorite.
B0006GVJEE|5.0|5 star review for the movie/DVD.  The DVD has a great picture quality, since we do get the Superbit version.  We also get a DTS and Dolby 5.1 surround sound tracks, which is awesome.  My only nit pick is, my order did not come with the slip case, but I'm okay with that.

0195073401|1.0|Want to look cool telling everybody how you understood the maths behind this? But you didn't understand the concepts, you didn't understand the ideology behind the book, you think you know microeconomics but you don't really understand it. Try Bernard Guerrien or Sophie Jallais, try to really understand microeconomics without this pseudoscientific crap.
B001UHOWW4|4.0|I'm not here to review the movie, but more the quality of the Audio/Video on the new Blu-ray release. I read two \\"professional\\" reviews (High def digest and Blu-ray.com) and they gave differing opinions of the video quality.. one praised, the other not so much. In my opinion, you will not be disappointed. Its beautiful, but a little soft and grainy. Audio is superb, end of story. Special features are very nice and entertaining. If you're offended by Mr Yunioshi, there's an asian perspective \\"extra\\" on the disk. I personally don't fall into that camp but can sympathize. It was a different time, and its comedy. I think its funny. I will laugh and keep on laughing.
B001YYQ9SS|5.0|An amazing quality and presentation that anyone would envy.  The film went without any problems and within the agreed days
B004G6009U|3.0|Disney shows it still has the chops in this its 50th feature length animated movie.  As you would expect with almost all animation done in the U. S., the artwork is flawless.  For example, Sleeping Beauty...no I mean Cinderella...no wait, Rapunzel (a very good Mandy Moore) spends all of her time barefoot.  In close ups when her foot hits the turf, you can see her toes actually spread apart as they would in reality.  The detail is amazing.  The color as good as you will ever see.  I must confess, I knew literally nothing of the story of Rapunzel other than she had long hair.  Now I do.  She was born a princess, but kidnapped by an evil woman who knew the magic, the child's hair had.  When Rap' sang, the hair glowed and could cure injuries and other maladies, including aging.  Stroking the long golden locks kept the woman, Gothel (Donna Murphy) young.  Posing as her real mother, Gothel keeps Rap' in check in their hidden tower/home.  As she gets older, Rap' wants to see the outside world and gets her chance when a good natured thief stumbles upon the tower.  Naturally the thief, Flynn Rider/Eugene (Zachary Levi) is young and hunky.  They make a deal and he helps her see the kingdom for the first time.  You can pretty much guess the rest.  They meet interesting characters along the way, deal with evil, charm the townsfolk, dispatch the bad guys and live happily ever after.  The music is always important in these movies and here I would say it is pretty good, but far from great.  There are no memorable tunes.  The story is rote, but the comedy is pretty good.  The horse steals the show and had me cracking up.
B005KXU83G|1.0|Would have bought if \\"Let it Rock\\" was restored to it's original length. That was the only reason I was looking forward to the remastered CD.
B0050CJNJ2|5.0|Coming off of a successful album like Need You Now, you know the group had to feel pressure when working on their follow up. But getting to the chorus of the first single released from Own the Night, Just a Kiss, you would have never known!! This group just keeps getting better and better.   If you thought Lady A was big before, this album just solidifies their superstar/headlining status in the country music genre. And us country fans are open to share this amazing group with the pop world because in the end, this music just deserves to be heard by all.  Friday Night is the perfect song to listen to on not just Friday nights, but any night you want to get pumped up and ready to have some fun. And Singing Me Home will have you singing along after the first listen. I wouldn't be surprised if Dancin' Away With My Heart became a future single as all can relate to reminiscing about the past.
B004XCUEU2|5.0|I cannot believe how great this DVD is. The albutm is the best I have heard in years. Really blows me away.
B0058VW36U|5.0|This is a very cute and simple to play strategy game, but should last awhile if you try to get all the stars in every level.
B0050QV0RQ|5.0|I would have payed $50 for this game 15 years ago.  Great game so far.  My only complaint is the character movement but that is a minor detail that I am getting better at as I play more.  I will be purchasing their new game when I am finished with this one!  My first app review, I'm enjoying this game so much I needed to recommend it to the rest of you.)
B005C5A66G|5.0|I must admit that I am a great fan of Machine Head's and have been for quite a while. I still get goosebumps hearing the tones from this band's first three albums: Burn My Eyes, The More Things Change, and The Burning Red. They are all fantastic compositions of melodic yet extremely powerful riffs combined with amazing vocals. Then came Supercharger, an album that kind of broke with the earlier albums. Don't get me wrong, I love it as I love Through the Ashes of Empires that followed and their latest, until now, album The Blackening (some believe this is their best album, but I disagree). These are great albums, but they never managed to get under my skin in the sense the first three did.<br /><br />And now Unto the Locust. This is again different: it combines the old, classic Machine Head of the first three albums with the elaborate and sometimes complex tunes of their following albums. And it adds a multi-leveled complexity, and a deeper sound that just grows on me. My first time playing through the seven (!) songs I felt both relief and excitement: this is a fantastic album. After listening to it a few more times, it is even better. And then better again. Each song seems to evolve each time I play it into having its own unequaled unique identity and sound.<br /><br />The songs mix slow parts with fast, heavy with light, very melodic electric guitars with rock-solid bass, and drums supporting both the fast-paced shifts and keeping it all together. Not to speak of Robb Flynn's always-perfect vocals...<br /><br />This is a true masterpiece. Do not make the mistake of getting turned off by the fact that it has only seven songs. Each song includes an album's worth of musical experience and delight, and they are both long and excellent. And, quite frankly, each time you play the album it just gets better and better - and each song seems new and uniquely refreshing every time. This is an album I will have a hard time stop playing, and an album I will always be playing and keep on playing.<br /><br />Unto the Locust is nothing close to my beloved first three albums, and it may in terms of sound be somewhat closer to The Blackening. Yet it is a new sound that is still VERY Machine Head. This band is evolving with grace; they change, think anew, aren't afraid to try new sounds and compositions - even very complex such - yet they have this amazing sixth sense for timeless metal that just makes their music stick with me. Always.
0439023521|5.0|This was a very unusal choice for me.  I usually stick to non-fiction or something very \\"realistic\\" in my reading choices.  So picking a book with a very unusual theme was a brave choice.<br /><br />Sometimes change is good and sometimes its bad.  In this instance it was great!  I found the story riveting and the author had my attention from the first few pages.  I didnt want to put the book down.  I read the first two novels in a few short days.<br /><br />Dont be deterred by the fact that it's geared towards \\"young adults\\" as some other potential readers have been.  Its not written in a childish way, and in any case Harry Potter was written for children.<br /><br />I highly recommend the series.
B0050QV0RQ|4.0|This RPG reminds me of the classic RPGs from the nes and snes. The timer bar that shows the order of who is going to attack is really cool. My only issue is that the character doesn't navigate very well. You select where you want the character to go, and if there is something in the way, the character will just stop instead of trying to go around. Overall, really fun!
B002HNA95E|3.0|It's usually impossible to satisfy the real fans of an artist with a compilation album. For my own account, I've never liked a compilation of Madonna. There are always missing important hits, unnecessarily included singles, weird edits etc.. The same problem here.<br /><br />First of all, who the hell came with the idea of releasing a single disc Madonna compilation? It's horrible! And as far as I see, all the reviews here ignore that one, establishing the double disc one as the essential. Brilliant fan approach.<br /><br />However, in my opinion even a double disc career-spanning Madonna compilation is not sufficient. How could it be anyway? 34 singles out of more than 70, almost all of them extremely successful, and well recorded. I have no objection to the song order on most of the first disc (I love them shuffled!) and to the songs selected (apart from the terrible 'Everybody', present here probably merely due to being the debut single), but considering tons of missing hits, I believe the double disc edition should have been the regular one whereas the deluxe edition should have consisted of three discs. I made up my own \\"deluxe\\" edition and I'd love to share it with you:<br /><br />CD #1:<br /><br />1.Hung Up (Album Edit)<br />2.Music<br />3.4 Minutes<br />4.Vogue (with \\"What are you looking at?\\" at the beginning, but the shorter original version.)<br />5.Holiday (Edit) (Closer to 7'' Edit, but with the original intro)<br />6.Like a Virgin<br />7.Into the Groove (Original Version)<br />8.La Isla Bonita<br />9.Like a Prayer<br />10.Ray of Light (Radio Edit)<br />11.Sorry (Single Edit)<br />12.Express Yourself (Unedited Video Remix)<br />13.Dress You Up<br />14.American Life (Radio Edit)<br />15.Erotica (Radio Edit)<br />16.Justify My Love<br />17.Human Nature (Video Version)<br />18.Revolver<br /><br />CD #2:<br /><br />1.Papa Don't Preach<br />2.Material Girl<br />3.Lucky Star (Video Edit)<br />4.Who's That Girl?<br />5.Burning Up<br />6.Open Your Heart<br />7.Crazy for You (Original Version)<br />8.Bad Girl (Edit)<br />9.Frozen (Edit with the original long intro)<br />10.Secret (Edit)<br />11.Cherish (7'' Edit)<br />12.I'll Remember<br />13.Miles Away (Radio Edit)<br />14.Rain (Video Edit)<br />15.Take a Bow (Edit)<br />16.Nothing Fails (Radio Edit) (replaced with 'Love Profusion' on international editions)<br />17.Don't Tell Me (Radio edit with fading outro)<br />18.Hollywood<br />19.It's So Cool<br /><br />CD #3:<br /><br />1.Beautiful Stranger (Radio Edit)<br />2.American Pie<br />3.Die Another Day (Radio Edit)<br />4.Jump (Radio Edit)<br />5.Give It 2 Me (Edit)<br />6.Deeper and Deeper (7\\" Edit)<br />7.Everybody (7'' Edit)<br />8.True Blue (Video Edit)<br />9.Borderline (Video Edit)<br />10.Angel<br />11.You'll See (Edit)<br />12.The Power of Good-Bye (Radio Edit)<br />13.Get Together (Album Edit)<br />(International editions have 'Fever (Edit One)' between 'Get Together' and 'Dear Jessie', excluding 'Everybody' as the 7th song)<br />14.Keep It Together (Single Remix) (replaced with 'Dear Jessie' on international editions)<br />15.Hanky Panky<br />16.This Used to Be My Playground (Video Edit)<br />17.You Must Love Me (Single Version)<br />18.Live to Tell (Edit with Intro)<br />19.Celebration<br /><br />The order of the songs are regulated according to a scheme. I wanted songs that go well together, usually with the same subject matter, period and/or grouping. Let me explain:<br /><br />The first disc opens with the biggest hits of Madonna from the 2000s, these being 'Hung Up', 'Music', and '4 Minutes'. Before we pass on to her most successful era, the '80s, her ultimate dancefloor item that welcomed her to the '90s provide the connection: 'Vogue'. Then we hear her most memorable songs from the '80s in chronological order: 'Holiday', 'Like a Virgin', 'Into the Groove', 'La Isla Bonita', and 'Like a Prayer'. The next three songs are her \\"pumping\\" songs: 'Ray of Light', 'Sorry', and 'Express Yourself' (Interestingly, all three are the second singles off the albums they were released from.). Then we meet the most controversial songs of her career: 'Dress You Up', 'American Life', 'Erotica', and 'Justify My Love'. After this era, she says she's not sorry for all the controversy with 'Human Nature', and the first disc closes with the first new song, 'Revolver'.<br /><br />The second disc opens with some other important '80s songs: 'Papa Don't Preach', 'Material Girl', 'Lucky Star', 'Who's That Girl?', 'Burning Up', 'Open Your Heart' (the last two completing each other perfectly in terms of the subject matter); and we finish this part with 'Crazy for You', that at the same time opens the next section, consisting of cool down/mid-tempo songs mostly from Madonna's favorite period of her career, that is between \\"Like a Prayer\\"-\\"Ray of Light\\", with the exception of 'Miles Away', which perfectly fits. Here we listen to 'Bad Girl', 'Frozen', 'Secret', 'Cherish', 'I'll Remember', 'Miles Away', 'Rain', and 'Take a Bow'. Into the end, two dance tracks from 2000s follow: 'Don't Tell Me' and 'Hollywood', but before them, a ballad from \\"American Life\\" connects these two parts, this being 'Nothing Fails' (replaced by 'Love Profusion' on the international edition). After that, we see the end of the second disc with another new song, my favorite one 'It's So Cool'.<br /><br />The third disc opens with three movie songs from the late '90s & early 2000s, these being 'Beautiful Stranger', 'American Pie', and 'Die Another Day' (With 'Beautiful Stranger' at the beginning, all three discs open with songs from different decades of her career: 'Hung Up' from the 2000s, 'Papa Don't Preach' from the '80s, and 'Beautiful Stranger' from the '90s.). Then we continue the up-tempo with two songs from her last studio albums: 'Jump' and 'Give It 2 Me'. Just like 'Vogue' connects the 2000s and '80s in the first disc, 'Deeper and Deeper', another '90s dancefloor masterpiece, connects the 2000s of this disc to the '80s, and we listen to four up/mid-tempo songs from her first three albums: 'Everybody', 'True Blue', 'Borderline', and 'Angel'. As the tempo slows down a bit, it's time for two brilliant \\"Broken but strong\\" ballads: 'You'll See' and 'The Power of Good-Bye'. The electronic items in 'The Power of Good-Bye' leads us to the energy of 'Get Together' (international editions have 'Fever' before this song, excluding 'Everybody' as the 7th song), and after we \\"get together\\", we face the fact that we have to \\"keep it together\\" with 'Keep It Together' (replaced by 'Dear Jessie' on international releases). The early '90s tune of this sweet song is perfectly matched with 'Hanky Panky', the second single off her first '90s album. 'Hanky Panky' also bridges to the beginning of the last section of the album: Movie ballads, consisting of 'This Used to Be My Playground', 'You Must Love Me', and 'Live to Tell'. And we are closing the third disc, and at the same time the album, with the track titled with the main reason of this collection: 'Celebration'!<br /><br />*All original album versions unless stated.<br /><br />*Some are original edits, that is just the abridged versions of the longer album versions, but not \\"The Immaculate Collection\\" remixes, which are, to me, the spoiled mixes of the original ones, which they are known as and loved for. This is not a remix album, so radio/video versions or at least near to original mixes are highly preferred. Like 'Vogue', 'Holiday', 'Lucky Star', 'Cherish', and 'Borderline'.<br /><br />*I usually prefer the radio/single edits unless I believe they are the butchered (= spoiled) versions of a good track ('Hung Up', '4 Minutes', 'Express Yourself'). This is a singles collection, and I'd like it to sound different from a fan-made list consisting of songs taken from the albums instead of singles.<br /><br />*All cleared-up, digitally mastered.<br /><br />*I even found some fan-made alternative album covers that I use for this version. Just Google them, there are so lovely ones, much better than the original (= bad!!) cover. The silver one is my favorite and I use it on my iPod.<br /><br />In 2012, I will \\"release\\" (=-D) a 30th year version with a fourth disc, completing all the missing singles. This will be as:<br /><br />('Everybody' opens the disc on international versions)<br />1.Causing a Commotion<br />2.Gambler<br />3.Spotlight (Edit)<br />4.Fever (Edit One) (on North American editions only)<br />5.Bedtime Story (Edit)<br />6.Nothing Really Matters (Edit)<br />7.Bye Bye Baby<br />8.Rescue Me (Single Mix)<br />9.Don't Cry for Me Argentina (Miami Mix Edit)<br />10.Love Profusion (replaced by 'Nothing Fails (Radio Edit)' on international editions)<br />11.Dear Jessie (replaced by 'Keep It Together (Single Remix)' on international editions)<br />12.What It Feels like for a Girl<br />13.Hey You (Radio Edit)<br />14.Oh Father<br />15.The Look of Love<br />16.One More Chance<br />17.Another Suitcase in Another Hall<br />18.Love Don't Live Here Anymore (Soulpower Radio Remix Edit)<br />19.Drowned World/Substitute for Love (Radio Edit)<br /><br />*This disc has chiefly a \\"'80s to '00s\\" orientation with an up-tempo/mid-tempo/ballads feel.<br /><br />*I'd like to include 'Broken (I'm Sorry)' as a new track, but cut it for the sake of including all the past singles.<br /><br />*I'd also love to include 'Me against the Music' with Britney Spears in the \\"controversial songs\\" section on the very first disc as a bonus, but there's no space; and I'm against cutting down the original versions of 'Hung Up', '4 Minutes', 'Express Yourself' etc. for the sake of a song which Madonna is only featured. Maybe in a future compilation, with future hits.

B0033AI4CK|3.0|A timely reminder that contrary to what modern producers think, 35mm film close-ups emphasize just how charismatic (and sexy) older actors and actresses can be when tearing into top notch material. Kudos to writer Paddy Chayefsky. All the leads are excellent, likewise the supporting cast. Ned Beatty hams up a messianic storm as the corporate bigwig who believes his own voodoo and Sidney Lumet has a riot satirizing a media monster that had probably already started to kill off talent with bad ratings. The 1920x1080p HD Blu Ray version is mostly OK, although low-light scenes look a bit grainy. Well worth hanging your head out of the nearest window and shouting: \\"I'm happy as hell about buying this film and I'm going to watch it again next week!\\" Watch out though, someone will probably shoot you before you've finished the sentence...
0385344325|4.0|I enjoyed reading this latest installment of Jack Reacher! I, personally, enjoyed some of the other books more than this one but it was still good; want to see some of the books made onto movies.
B004VUP8WK|4.0|I absolutely love this album.  It is innovative, intense, and mean, just as any other Morbid Angel record.  Although this one has received a lot of negative reviews, I give this album a four-star rating because it is well-constructed and it is definitely original.  One of my favorite characteristics of Morbid Angel is that no two records of theirs sound alike.  Each one is unique in its own right.  The only problem I have with Illud Divinum Insanus is that Pete Sandoval is not on it.  However, Tim Yeung does an amazing job holding it together and he deserves some respect.  Trey shreds it as well as he ever did.  His lead is phenomenal.  I have been a death metal fan for twenty years and I can appreciate the value of this record.  Give it a chance.

B005G4TJI4|3.0|I'll make this simple folks.  I haven't seen the film, but I'm sure it rocks, as I even enjoyed TF2.  But here's the deal.  This is a bare bones release.  Standard 2D BD and DVD copy.  That's it.  If you're fine with that, go ahead and buy this cheaper version.  But if you're any at all interested in extra features and 3D (&lt;~ which I'm not, btw), then wait for the Deluxe Editions coming out in Q4.  In fact, this title was originally supposed to come out in Q4, but Bay decided to release this bare bones version for those who couldn't wait and aren't all that concerned with special features.  I don't go to the theaters anymore myself, so waiting years for film is nothing for me, so another couple months for the BD is no biggy for me.

B0052RDHTM|1.0|Did not know this book (trilogy) was expected so was very excited to see it today at \\"COSTCO\\".  It's a big heavy book and the pricetag was $14.99  Figured I'd save the weight and buy it for my Kindle.  $18.99?? ARE YOU KIDDING ME? and, on top of the price, I have never seen so many poor reviews for a Follett novel.  I'm assuming a \\"1\\" rating for both anticipated shallow content and OMG pricing.

B00005JLKN|4.0|Never having been a fan of the Hannibal Lecter movie franchise (no, not even \\"Silence of the Lambs\\", sorry fanboys and fangirls), I was, to put it mildly, reluctant to give \\"Red Dragon\\" the time of day.  When, last night, I finally got around to watching it, I was even more dismayed to see that this was credited both as a Dino De Laurentiis production and as a Brett Ratner film.  It took nothing short of a Herculean effort for me to not hit the STOP button right then and there and move on to, presumably, greener pastures.  Fortunately the virtue of patience won out and I was treated to a surprisingly well made thriller.  Let's be honest, no matter what the faithful (and they appear to be legion) would have us believe, the saga of Hannibal Lecter and his gastronomic peculiarities was never great literature nor has it translated into great filmmaking.  Each and every addition to the franchise is firmly esconsed in the giallo/slasher/body-count sub-genre.  I don't mean this as a put down.  Some of the films in this league are, rightly, considered groundbreaking.  I'm thinking of \\"Psycho\\", \\"Deep Red\\", \\"Halloween\\", \\"Peeping Tom\\", \\"Bay of Blood\\", etc., and while \\"Red Dragon\\" never quite reaches the level of these iconic films, it nonetheless succeeds admirably where, in my opinion, the rest of the films in this series fail.  Acting wise, this has got to be the best cast a Hannibal Lecter film has ever boasted, and far better than it deserves.  Aside from Anthony Hopkins (of course), you have Ralph Fiennes, Edward Norton, Emily Watson, Harvey Keitel, Philip Seymour Hoffman, and Anthony Heald as Lecter's almost-equally-unhinged warder Dr. Chilton.  Surprisingly (or maybe not) it is Hopkins who proves to be the weakest link in this thespian daisy chain.  His turn here as Lecter is so lacking in any subtlty that you wonder how anyone would NOT be immediately creeped out.  While this is forgiveable in the scenes taking place within the confines of the Baltimore sanitarium thatLecter calls home, it borders on the laughable in the early scenes showing the Dr. out in the free world.    Credit the script and the acting of Ralph Fiennes with the fascinating character of Dolarhyde.  Unlike other entries in this franchise (which invariably pit Lecter against another psycho in some kind of sickie grudge match), Dolarhyde is much more than a collection of ticks and bug-eyed stares.  His courtship scenes with Emily Watson's character begin so sweetly than their inevitable descent into madness and perversion registers like a punch in the gut.  Granted, the script has its issues.  The film could have (and should have) ended about ten minutes sooner than it did, but I'm sure the constraints of studio filmmaking dictated otherwise, so I'm willing to give them a pass on that.    As for Ratner...  I actually managed to gain some respect for the guy after watching this film.  Though Ratner may not be an innovator in either style or substance, but he has the good sense to trust a well-written script and his impressive cast and stay the hell out of their way.  No one would ever accuse Ratner of being a great director, nor \\"Red Dragon\\" of being a great movie, but both stand nearer the threshold of greatness than anyone could have predicted.
0312323867|5.0|This books is not my typical reading style.  However, someone recommended that I read something borrowed and something blue.  I enjoyed both books, but I LOVED this book.  I love Ms. Griffin writing style and she was able to provide a smooth transition from something borrowed to something blue.  Also through her writing she was about to show that yes we all make mistakes and that things can seem completely hopeless but to just continue to do your best and give things your all because you never know what wonderful ending/ beginning is awaiting us in the form of friendship and love.

B000IZA9PI|4.0|I am not a Star Trek fan. I only bought this movie because it was super cheap at the used DVD store, and I am falling in love with Tom Hardy's acting.  At times, the film is cheesy. Not being a fan, I hadn't seen the show or other movies or whatever is out there. However, I didn't really have many character questions. I think that the movie stands alone well. The questions that I did have were more plot specific. If I wrote them out here though, it would be a spoiler, so I will refrain.  If you are a Tom Hardy fan, then I say watch the movie! There is a scene where his character asks to touch a woman's hair, forgetting where he was for a moment. I really liked the expressions Tom used for the character in that part. Tom Hardy plays duality so well, and this film is another example of that. The character is conflicted by curiosity and revenge. I make no attempts to hide that Tom Hardy was the highlight of the movie for me.
B005K8QIS0|5.0|We all know that film adaptations of books are rarely up to the mark. There are exceptions.<br />Kate Atkinson has written some superior crime novels around English private investigator Jackson Brody, a former police man. The novel called Case Histories has him involved in 3 diverse cases at the same time, all related to mysteries about missing or dead girls.<br />A little girl has disappeared 30 years ago. Now her father has died and the girl's sisters find her Blue Mouse toy in father's desk.<br />A young girl starts an internship in her father's law firm. On her first day in office, a man shows up with a knife, kills her, and disappears.<br />While a woman is in jail for murdering her husband, her little girl disappears from foster care.<br />Lots of problems for Brody.<br />This is the only book of hers that I read myself. My daughter tells me that her others are also good.<br />A BBC series with 6 episodes based on 3 of Atkinson's Brody novels has been produced and shown on TV in summer 2011. This is brand-new stuff. I watched it with my wife and I was very impressed. If you like the genre, you will appreciate this as top of the class. The production added some local charisma  by transferring the location from somewhere in England to more remarkable Edinburgh, with all the available options on the language side.
B002XTXG1G|5.0|I am working my way through the Tom Hardy movies. This was the fourth one that I watched (Inception, Wuthering Heights, Warrior, then Bronson). At first, I watched it on the Amazon On Demand (or whatever it is called). Then, I bought the DVD.  It's one of those films that is so strange and good that you can't stop watching. I read that some people didn't like it because Tom Hardy played Bronson too sympathetic. I found that the movie also played out in a way where I never forgot what the character was capable of.
0439023521|4.0|The Hunger Games is a 2008 young-adult science fiction novel by Suzanne Collins, and the first in a trilogy. In a post-apocalyptic dystopian totalitarian state, children are selected to fight to the death on live television.<br /><br />This is hardly an original idea; it's most strongly reminiscent of Koushun Takami's Battle Royale and, to a lesser extent, Stephen King's The Long Walk and The Running Man (the movie more so than the novella). Yet Collins manages to keep the setting and the games themselves reasonably fresh. And, after something of a slow start, the book becomes an entertaining, page-turning affair.<br /><br />Like far too many recent young-adult novels, The Hunger Games is written in the first-person present tense. I don't know if this is an attempt to engage teens perceived to have short attention spans or what, but it's obnoxious, and it provides no benefit over conventional past tense (one eventually gets used to it, fortunately).<br /><br />Aside from this, Collins' writing is solid (although the copy editing on this book is rather poor - not her fault). Katniss is a satisfactorily sympathetic character: she's impulsive but self-sacrificing, and clever, resourceful, and self-sufficient without being deal-breakingly sassy or annoying. The book has a couple of convenient plot coincidences, but nothing unforgivable.<br /><br />As young-adult books go, The Hunger Games might be as dark and violent as they come. And the novel stumbles here because it doesn't seem to have much to say about its subject matter (beyond \\"the government making kids kill each other is bad\\"). The protagonist is forced to kill other children to survive (most of them, like her, are in this situation through no fault of their own) - you would think that this scenario would lend itself to some psychological self-exploration, but Collins punts on this issue, as Katniss, with only superficial reflection, is implausibly businesslike on the subject - she never thinks much about the people she's killed, even during her many quiet times. This suggests a disturbing degree of amorality. It's as though all these kids get dumped into the arena already in full-on Lord of the Flies mode. Collins herself seems much more interested in 1984-style criticism of totalitarian government, which is the subject she's set herself up to address in the sequel. All of this may put off certain readers, and not unreasonably. In short, Collins' treatment of moral issues is a legitimate concern, and a missed opportunity - her scenario, unlike, say, The Running Man, doesn't lend itself well to action movie-style morality.<br /><br />On the whole, The Hunger Games, while hardly a perfect book, is suspenseful and entertaining, which always overcomes a lot of flaws. It's recommended to readers who like this sort of thing - if you can acknowledge the moral issues.her many quiet times. This suggests a disturbing degree of amorality.

B001GZ6QEC|5.0|La mejor pelicula de batman hasta la fecha. PUNTO!  La historia es la continuacion de Batman Incia (Batman Begins), la cual era la mejor pelicula de batman, haciendo olvidar los dialogos estupidos y atuendos ridiculos de las peliculas reciente del Herie Murcielago.  He de decir que las actuaciones son estupendas, Cristian Bale es muy creible como Batman  y Heath Ledger (R.I.P) es THE JOKER, le da vida al personaje de una forma siniestra... .  En Cuanto al Disco, BLURAY FULL HD, Bluray Live y un Bluray especial con detras de escenas, explicaciones de filmacion de las escenas mas arriesgadas (como el salto base de shangai), e incluso una especie de histia previa y paralela a la de la pelicula. He de advertir que la mayoria del contenido del bluray extra esta en Standard definition, asi que eso puede ser una molestia para algunos.  En Conlusion:  Excelente film, Mucho contenido extra, BD Live. No puede faltar en tu coleccion.  PD:  Recomiendo que tambien compren o vean  Batman Begins.. disfrutaran y entenderan muchisimo mas a The Dark Knight.

Now this sits unused in my garage next to my brand new 3-in-1 machine.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|I really don't understand all the these low ratings for Star Wars: The Complete Saga (Episodes I-VI) [Blu-ray].  While I do appreciate the opinions of the many, many, perhaps too many Star Wars purists who posted their comments on Amazon, I really do wonder how many actually bought and actually viewed this collection's $80 content.    Kudos:  1. Affording me the opportunity to sit down with my 16 year-old for a couple of hours and see and talk about the \\"movies\\" that excited me when I was 16.   2. Minimal packaging for all these disks.  3. Star Wars: The Complete Saga (Episodes I-VI) [Blu-ray]; Both video and sound. WOW!  Cons:  The grainy effect on disk 1.    EDIT: (I understand from others the \\"grain\\" on disk 1 is probably a limitation to the blu-ray conversion technology used for the older films.  I guess I am too spoiled with the razor sharp HD content on the other blu-ray disks in this collection.  Regardless, and IMO the whole package earns a five-star entertainment rating.
B00466HN86|5.0|Expect in-your-face fatherhood morals bursting from an action/emotion story.<br />Expect the F-words: Faith, Fatherhood, Fears, Failings, Family, Forgiveness.<br />Expecting goodness, I entered the theater for the 1st opening day matinee. Found it great.<br />Sheriff Deputies know the necessity of partnership. They take it to heart by forming a small group of men, adding one ethnic carpenter outsider, and strive to make a difference in the lives of their families. They base their \\"Resolutions\\" vows upon the Bible. Unfortunately it takes some tragic circumstances to get the men to this point. Their courageous open faith position will not always be taken well...as Dep. Adam Mitchell (Alex Kendrick-Dir, Writer, Editor, Actor) states, \\"some will mock, some will have no resolve, others will say `I WILL'. Men of courage with God's help.\\" He notes they will (and do) face conflict, challenge, controversy, & need courage. Each man has his own family issues, each an individual path of struggle.<br /><br />A debate is sure to develop. Which is best, \\"Courageous\\" or \\"Fireproof\\" (2008); the last 2 films by the Kendrick brothers. I vote, equal. Alex does it all in this 4th Faith-based film adventure, while Stephen writes and produces. They also did \\"Flywheel\\" 2003; and \\"Facing the Giants\\" 2006. Is this film a moral and faith statement from the writers? YES! Of course! That's what they and their church intend. Expect it, and perhaps be blessed.<br /><br />This film begins immediately with ACTION, life-threatening, a crashing peak, and then an emotional end to the scene. Hold on to your hat, because you have almost 2 hours of emotion, action, and even some comedy ahead after that. Ken Bevel, as Hayes (Yes, from Fireproof) is new to this police squad. No big HOLLYWOOD stars in this low-budget film that relies on none of the typical theater gimmicks. This film, as in preceding Kendrick film successes, relies on spiritual subject matter, PG13 rating, and the targeting of the Christian Theater viewer, eager for BIGGER-FASTER-STRONGER, but also family and faith oriented. It's worked for the Kendricks' casts & crews in the past, it will work again. Expect \\"COURAGEOUS\\" in the theater for a few weeks, and then the DVD will be bought by those same viewers...and more.<br /><br />Viewership will grow, word of mouth, father to father, mom to mom, pew to pew, family to family.R-FASTER-STRONGER, but also family and faith oriented.

B004PP158W|5.0|This is by far the funniest episode of the season and one of the funniest for the show.  I watched it yesterday and I'm still laughing about it today when I think about some of the scenes.  It's great to have some good comedic relief in a serious show like Supernatural.  I love how they made fun of themselves and their own show.  Dean said \\"who would watch this stuff?\\" and Sam said \\"according to the reporter, not many people.\\"  And they made fun of the props.  LOL!  Great episode.  I will probably even watch it again!!

B005974CNA|2.0|I am almost giving up on DT now.  I had high hopes for DT without Portnoy. as I was not a fan of his heaviness, his writing, his growling, or his control of the band.  This first CD without Portnoy has some good songs, good lyrics (Outcry), but most of the album is ruined by too much soulless instrumentals that more often than not do not even match the lyrics, or the rest of the song as a whole.  This is especially painful on Outcry and Lost Not Forgotten.  Outcry has very strong anti war lyrics with music that does not even come close to matching those lyrics.  Jordan Ruddess needs to stop masturbating his keyboard and actually play as part of the song.    As with most DT it takes a few listens to really get it all.  I gave it several listens and was just bored. That is the problem, DT's music has become dead boring.

B005D4Y4H8|5.0|A fabulous 19 hours of music and commentary from, in my humble opinion, the greatest pianist ever.  Glenn Gould has exquisite taste in music, as well as the ability to share his enthusiasm and passion.  A natural teacher, explaining complex musical terms in a way that ordinary, non-musical people can easily understand.    Then, he plays.  You can see and hear the absolute joy of his playing.  Awe-inspiringly beautiful.  There is a lot of playing and some pieces have not been recorded elsewhere.  So, this is a real treat for Glenn Gould fans to hear \\"new\\" recordings.    He stopped giving concerts in 1964.  And I think he wanted listeners to have a more up-close and personal experience of music than the concert hall distant relationship.  You will get that up-close and personal experience with this set.  This DVD collection is a \\"must have\\" for any person who loves music, and for anyone who wants to learn more about music.    It will most certainly entertain, educate, and delight.
142311339X|5.0|\\"The Lost Hero\\" by Rick Riordan is about a 16- year- old boy, Jason, and his friends Piper and Leo. Jason is a handsome demigod currently fighting memory loss due to Hera, goddess of marriage. Jason and his friends help fight obstacles to get to Hera. As you read \\"The Lost Hero\\" you will want to join Jason and his pals on his quest to stop Gaea from waking from her sleep and get back his memory.  The author is trying to emphasize the importance of having a family. Jason is trying to remember family members, such as, his sister Thalia. Piper loves her dad a lot but, he isn't always there to love her back. Leo is guilty because he thinks that his mother's death is his fault.  These three characters have a friendship among each other. Piper is blackmailed to choose between her family or her friends. Leo is getting dreams about Tia Callida, who, in his past, tried to kill him. Jason needs the help of his friends to defeat the giants from waking. Without his friends, he would die. He also worries about Piper's safety a lot.  You should read this book because there is always excitement, and never any boring parts. I like the book because Leo's chapters always make you laugh even though they're serious. This book, not only brings exhilaration, but also enhances your knowledge of Roman mythology.   READ THIS BOOK!!! :3
B0050QV0RQ|5.0|Runs great on my tablet, but graphics suited best for your pocket device.  Music is quickly redundant, and dialogue is goofy.  Plenty of adventure to keep you distracted for a while.  If you like the classic rpg, this is a good throwback edition.
B000MZHW40|1.0|I have always enjoyed this film, from the story to the acting to the soundtrack.  I was disappointed that it came with a nick in the disc, and the return policy gave me little option but dealing with it.  How am I supposed to know if it's damaged if I don't open it?  It wasn't a lot of money, but if Amazon doesn't feel like backing up what they offer, then I will be skeptical of ordering in the future.
B004SBBDB2|4.0|The Amazon Basics Component AV Cable for Apple products is a nice addition to your i-product, television combo.  However, it may be a bit limited as compared to what you might expect.  You see, sight unseen, many people (including myself) seem to assume that any visual on the i-product (I'm basing my experience on an iPhone 4) will be visible on the television you hook up to.  This is not the case.  It has to be said that this is not a fault of the cable.  The iPhone, iPod or iPad include software that controls this for sure.  But you might not be expecting, for instance, that you cannot show photos via the cable, or play music only from the iPod, or even view video via certain specialty apps (for instance neither the Adult Swim or Crackle app would play video via the cable).<br /><br />However, video you've taken and saved on your device can be played with no problem.  Youtube videos via the app or online can be played.  And it seemed that most players that worked with internet surfing via Safari would transfer via the cable to the television too.  So once you know what to expect it seems to work great.<br /><br />As it is a component cable it transfers the video and sound nicely with very good quality (well little to no loss anyway).  And the cable has a USB plug to so you can use it to link to a computer for synching or charging.  The cable is good and long (6.5 feet) and a sleek black in color.  Overall I'd recommend it so long as you know what it can actually do for you.
B002N8A14M|5.0|I love that it came with a case that is detachable so I can protect the ipod wherever I go. It's comfortable on your arm, sits securely and looks just fine. Exactly what I needed!
B005C5A6C0|5.0|Why is that 99% of the reviews have to compare Unto the Locust to The Blackening? Both are masterpieces, both in their own way. Old MH fan here, and I don't like TMTC and SC. But Unto the locust is more than I expected, really. The TTAOE was great, they overdone it with the Blackening. But I can't say they overdone The Blackening with Unto The Locust. I like tot think, both The Blackening and Unto the Locust are on the same level, but in other ways. It's like Regin in Blood and Seasons in the Abyss. Both are great, both in their own ways. Just as these two albums. The special edition is great, I like the acoustic version of Darkness Within more than the original, the Rush cover is weak, but the Judas Priest one rules. The weakest track on the album is Who We Are in my opinion, though it has a great ending. And yes, many of the reviews are right... the album grows unto you after more and more listens.
B005K2KCPG|5.0|This album delivers. I've only listened a few times and it is a bit different then the first release.  Not quite sure how to put it, but it has a bit of a more mainstream sound, a bit more mainstream rock oriented.  I love all these guys on their own, but together they really raise the bar. Their sound on this one seems to be more Sammy and Michael Anthony influenced than Joe and Chad.  Don't get me wrong, Joe makes his mark, but mainly on the solo's.  The riffs sound like solo Sammy all the way.  Summary, nothing ground breaking other than 4 really strong musicians making some fun rock and roll music. No incredible hits here, but no slackers either.   I also have to add that when the first Chickenfoot CD came out I figured it would be 4-5 years before we saw another one. Super excited that we only had to wait 2 years.  Hope they keep it going.  There are not enough good rock bands around!  EDIT: I've had this for a bit more time now and have given it a few more listens. I'm bumping up my 4 star review to a 5 star review. Start to Finish I think it is a bit stronger than the first record. I passed on seeing them live on the last tour but plan on seeing them this go around, just a bummer Chad won't be with them.  Strong Points:  - Alright - A bit lame on the guitar riff but a very likable singalong.  - Different Devil - Classic Sammy. If I didn't know better would say it was a solo Sammy song.  - Up Next - Top rocker on this CD. Rivals \\"Get it Up\\" as Chickenfoots most rocking song. This will be killer live!  - Come Closer - Another classic Sammy song with a nice bluesy guitar track from Joe.
B005DKLPF6|4.0|This is Mastodon, The Hunter. The year is 2011. Not 2002. I am loving this album. Mastodon continue to evolve as they wear their collective hearts on their sleeves. I give them props for trimming the fat and tightening things up, it's okay, it doesn't mean you're selling out or appealing to the masses (well sometimes it does). But all of their talent, creativity, and eccentricities (word?) are still on display. This album like Crack The Skye will become like a warm blanky for my ear drums, soothing the savage beast and some how bringing it out at the same time.
1609611543|5.0|This book is a must read for everyone. It takes you step by step as to why and how wheat may be sabotaging your health and what you can do about it. The section on the changes made to wheat is eyeopening. Dr. Davis' writing style makes reading this book most enjoyable.<br /><br />I have been wheat free(gluten free) for over 8 years. I use to make all my own \\"healthy\\" whole wheat breads. Little did I know I was killing myself - I felt as thought I was dying. When I dropped wheat, the changes in my health were nothing short of miraculous. Oh yes, I also lost 20 lbs that took me too an ideal weight.<br /><br />Years ago, Dr. Alessio Fasano, director of the Univ of Md Center for Celiac Research told me in conversation, \\"No one digests wheat well.\\"<br /><br />I have read and participated in Dr. Davis' blog and forum for years. He is truly interested in preventing and reversing disease by finding and treating the underlying causes and not just treating symptoms. Although I was wheat free long before this book was published, I have learned much from Dr. Davis and continue to learn.

B005NA3B8U|4.0|I find the controls on this game to be much nicer than other stearing games.  Its a good rush of a game but single hit kills means you have to go up a level from basic causal gamer.  Probably need to put some tense concentration into this one.

1419702203|5.0|I just received my preordered copy of Olivia Harrison's George Harrison Living In The Material World. With dust cover intact, I opened the book and thumbed through it a few seconds, stopping and glancing at a couple of the pictures that caught my eye. Then, I removed the dust cover. I noticed the title/author, etc. on the spine being upside down, nothing on the 'front' cover and then I looked at the 'back' cover and there was the title of the book. What has apparently happened, and I don't know if it has happened to all the first issues or just mine, but the cover was put on backwards. Obviously, this doesn't affect the content of the book but it does raise the question of what the hell happened. Yes it makes it unique but I would truly prefer the book in its proper state.
0525423281|5.0|Ah, the companion novel to Anna and the French Kiss.<br /><br />Do you like chick-lit? Do you not like chick-lit? Really, your answers here don't matter because I can pretty much guarantee that you will like this book. I mean, what's not to like? I absolutely adore Stephanie Perkins' writing style and her characters. If you couldn't tell, I'm making a gushing face right now.<br /><br />Contemporary YA used to be something that I shied away from because I didn't think that a \\"believable\\" story could be nearly as good as a fantasy one. Let me tell you, I was wrong about that. While reading Lola and the Boy Next Door I felt myself get swept away into the story of Lola and San Fran. She reminded me a lot of Anna in that I really like her but she's different enough that I don't feel like Stephanie Perkins made the same character and just put a different name on her. Anna and Lola are two very different girls. And can I tell you how excited I was to see Ms. Anna and St. Clair show up in this book?! :)<br /><br />Of course, I can't write a review without talking about Cricket Bell. Perfect, perfect Cricket Bell. He is making a run for my dream boy - kicking Sam Roth from Shiver off the top spot. I loved everything about Cricket Bell - from his plaid shirts and striped pants (see cover for example) to his dorky/geekiness (hello, engineering!).<br /><br />Okay - with all my gushing I only have one little itty bitty thing that bugged me during the book and that is that Lola mentions that Calliope throws extra stuff into her Short Program (Calliope is a figure skater) for extra points. The Short Program has eight required elements and so you while you can add other things than those eight, you can't get extra points for them. You can do that in the Long Program though. Womp Womp - I know..I'm a nit-picking party-pooper. But that is a technicality that can be easily overlooked.<br /><br />But seriously people - when this book comes out..it is definitely worth buying. Heck, just writing this review makes me want to go read it again. AND I've already pre-ordered it.<br /><br />If you're looking for a cute, summer read or a present for your sister/girlfriend/whoever, this book (and Anna and the French Kiss) is a guaranteed winner.it again.

B003Y5H5JM|5.0|The film is wonderful: a flawless version of the Tempest. I'm glad I got it.<br /><br />But I'm going to sell this rotten blu-ray disc the second I can get the DVD.<br /><br />I've waited a year, and I got the blu-ray because I just couldn't stand to wait any longer for the DVD. The film on it is wonderful, but the blu-ray that carries the film is horrible: It fails to load promptly on my old player, and what it does slowly load is bloody awful advertising for [[ASIN:B004A8ZWUQ Pirates of the Carribean]]. What junk! The instructions displayed to skip around the advertising (which is not what I paid for) make this blu-ray hang up the player if I tap either of the 2 menu keys it says to use; the third key it doesn't say to tap aborts the junk. The blu-ray usually hangs-up the player on the second feature played, and it always hangs the player when I try to play the 'Los Angeles Rehearsal' feature. And of course, the blu-ray won't re-start where it was when I quit for an hour's break.<br /><br />The problem is not the player, it's the studio's nasty java-based copy protection software embedded on the blu-ray disc. The recently-purchased David Attenborough '[[ASIN:B004PHSTWK Madagascar]]' blu-ray plays with no troubles (no java).<br /><br />I recommend waiting for the DVD if you can stand it; the film is strikingly visual, but I don't think it needs to be high-res for the beauty of the film to come through. On the other hand, if you only will settle for blu-ray resolution, you can buy my copy of [[ASIN:B003Y5H5JM this awful disc]] very cheaply once [[ASIN:B004M9ZI0M 'The Tempest' on DVD]] is available.
B004J4WKTW|2.0|Given the awards, the long list of accolades, the 4.5 stars here on Amazon and the chatter about a movie, I was fully expecting to be wowed. To be amazed, as one might be at a circus. To be impressed, as I love the feeling of finding a new, creative world to explore. In fact, I've gotten ~20% of the way into this book, and am ready to quit. And I will read almost anything; it's lingeringly sad to leave even a bad story unread. I owe it to the author, and more so to the characters, who usually have some hold on me. But not these.   There is great imagination evident in the ideas here, and in the constructs and some of the vignettes, so I cannot totally disagree with the praise. The idea of the circus, the description of the clock, some of the language, etc., are individually intriguing and attractive. But the writing is unbearable. Characters are wooden. Sentences are choppy, and organized into chapters of such brevity that it seems nothing's been said, and then we're on to the next. Events that would clearly have a strong emotional component and enough complexity to warrant some description are relayed in two or three sentences; not just occasionally, for effect, but always.  It is a noteworthy technique, how the story advances so many parallel narratives almost simultaneously. Each chapter deals only with one character and is only a few hundred words long, so rather than reading about A for a while, and the B, its like reading about all of them together. The absence of any emotion or character building kills it for me, though. The writing is in the third person and emotionless; a litany of he went here, she went there, he went over there... So although the scenery is beautiful in places, it's also increasingly frustrating not to get more than a glimpse. Why did A go there? What happened when she got there? But, the narrative has already moved on to B, and I'm just left, wondering.
B002KYHZLQ|2.0|My God, this book is a chore to get through.  I made it through the first 3 books of this series so I feel I've come far enough to offer a warning to those considering this series.  This is not George R.R. Martin.  Not even close.  I understand that this is the 1st of a 10 book series but the narrative is nearly incomprehensible.  It will start to make a bit more sense about halfway through the 2nd book but unless you are really into characters who stand around \\"grimacing\\" and pondering the word \\"efficacious,\\" give this one a pass.  And the names!  Whiskeyjack?  Seriously?  Yes, Annomander Rake is a great name, I admit it.  I also admit this review is probably not at all helpful... I just needed to get it out of my system.
B005LAZIRY|3.0|While I love how they did the acoustic only \\"Damnation\\", it was a STUPID idea for them to do that with this release because it had been TOO long since they released a true multidimensional Opeth album. I don't count \\"Watershed\\" because that was only half good and they where due a strong comeback after that, and this is certainly not a comeback, more like a whimper.<br /><br />Okay okay, I'm not saying that the music itself is \\"BAD\\" per say, in fact it's very good, but it's simply not good enough for Mikael Åkerfeldt to abandon what the band has always been amazing at, which is death metal. While I much appreciate bands that are willing to change and evolve, this is just radical. If Mikael Åkerfeldt wants to change the direction of Opeth so much that they no longer do metal music, then they should lay the Opeth name to rest and call themselves \\"The Åkerfeldt Band\\" because this is only half of what \\"Opeth\\" actually does, and as a HUGE Opeth fan, this is disheartening............
0525423281|5.0|I was swept into Lola's story from the very beginning of the book. Having lived her whole life in the same house in San Francisco, her neighbors and nemesis, the Bell twins, have moved away and returned, based on Calliope Bell's figure skating schedule.  Lola's independent style of dress and hobby of sewing have marked her as an individual with her own mind. Dating Max, who's in a band, somewhat worries her strict parents, who insist on brunch every Sunday with the boyfriend.  Lola, in order to understand responsibility, has a part time job at a movie theater, where we are treated to Perkins former characters, Anna and St. Claire. Cricket Bell, aptly named, has dabbled in invention all his life and as an early high school graduate, is already at Berkley, where he knows St. Claire. This reads like a contemporary John Hughes movie and I mean that in the best of ways. Perkins has really nailed the late teen trials and angst perfectly.
B002SSUQFG|4.0|I bought the watch in May, a year ago, and it \\"died\\" last month in August. Died by the way of running 5 minutes fast each hour. The watch repair shop attributed it to \\"sticky mechanism\\". An automatic watch should not need to be serviced since it is never \\"opened\\".  While the watch is handsome looking and nice, I had expected a couple of years of carefree service from it. I have kept it well; no dents, no scratches on the face or excessive wear on the strap yet it malfunctions in just over a year of service.  Greatly disappointed with this Seiko. Never had a watch malfunction in such a short time. I should stick to crystal driven battery watches, they generally have better reliability. At the minimum they last the life of the battery till the case is opened for a replacement battery.   Updated:  It is now working as before. It is accurate and the automatic mechanism winds it up for the night, it is still running when I pick it up in the morning. I am more than delighted to get my handsome watch back. Updated the rating to 4-stars, I still love the watch.  About the service experience: Got it repaired at Seiko service center in NJ. They honored the 3 year warranty card which I simply filled up with the details of the watch and attached Amazon's invoice. I sent it there at my own cost after contacting the service center by email. You need to be patient though, the reply came in a few days with a form and instructions not to ship in the original gift box (which will not be returned). Repair was fairly quick. It took a little more than 2 weeks before I got it back. I only got an acknowledgement of receipt more than a week after I shipped it saying it is estimated that it will take a month to fix. However, a week later it was at my doorstep via UPS.

1416911049|5.0|My son had to read this book for a summer reading project. We'd asked him how he was enjoying the book and he was telling me about. I thought it sounded interesting, so I decided to check it out. I'm so glad I did. This was a really inventive story. The whole concept seemed to mock our society and the way we view beauty, then twists it off into a whole other dimension. I could totally see the author poking fun at ourselves. Uglyville and New Pretty Town, where if you aren't Pretty and perfect then you're nobody. He totally made a statement and I honestly applaud his creativity in doing so. The characters were well rounded, Tally's point of view was deeply set, so I saw everything right along with her. It kept me reading. I couldn't put it down and made me care enough that I am now looking forward to heading to the library tomorrow to read the next book, Pretties. This is completely out of my normal genre, so I found it a very fun read.   Some of the descriptions were a little hard to follow, they weren't quite precise, so I had trouble picturing what he was trying to get me to see, and some of Tally's descriptions of the \\"Rusties\\" stuff, such as the Helicopters, were confusing. It isn't until Shay explains what they are that you finally understand what Tally was looking at, but I found I didn't really mind. And yeah, the plot is uber simple and very easy to guess at. I had it figured out about a hundred pages in. But that didn't stop me from enjoying the book because I got very into the characters. Make me care and I'm yours and he did that. Great read.

0525423281|4.0|LOLA AND THE BOY NEXT DOOR, by Stephanie Perkins, is the adorable companion novel to Anna and the French Kiss. Lola is a girl with an intense eye for fashion, two gay dads, and a twenty-two year old boyfriend (Lola is seventeen). If her life wasn't full enough, her former best friend and crush, Cricket Bell, moves back into the house next door along with his ego-centric figure skating twin, Calliope. Their parting years ago stuck with Lola but with Cricket back in town, can she handle the rekindling of a former flame?  I had a great time reading this book. Lola was adorable, fun, and quirky. I loved her interesting style and her family dynamic with her two dads. She seemed to have a pretty stable head on her shoulders, minus the whole 'dating a guy in his twenties'-thing. From the beginning I really disliked the relationship between Max and Lola. I felt the same way everyone else did in the book in that dating someone five years older than you works later in life, not when one of the parties is a teenager. I found Max controlling and very insecure in turn suffocating Lola. On the other hand, I loved the history between Lola and Cricket and I yearned for them to get together! I liked how Perkins slowly revealed their past together and I think the idea of loving the boy next door is classic and romantic.  Along with a bunch of new characters, Perkins brought back Anna and St. Clair from Anna and the French Kiss, so I think fans of that book will definitely be pleased. Anna and St. Clair had a larger role than I expected but it was nice to have some connection between the books.  Without spoiling too much, I just wanted to say that this book is definitely one to add to your list before the year is out. Once I started reading it, I didn't want to put it down. Lola is a well formed character and one that I think teens can relate to. She is not 'the popular girl' but she does what she wants and what makes her happy. I loved her crazy fashion sense and it definitely playsa role in each aspect of her life. I give this book a thumbs up and I you will enjoy it too!

B005ELZKWS|5.0|Just when you thought that `album rock' was dead four of the baddest mothers on the planet get together and made a rip your heart out rock n' roll album. The songwriting, the playing - hell, there are three musicians here who are considered among the best on their instrument of all time - production and recording and, maybe more than anything a feeling of a band, jelled, tight, and in in psychic communication with each other. this might just be the best album any of these guys ever played on.<br /><br />A super-group to be sure, but perhaps never before in rock history has a super group been such a cohesive unit. These guys had a huge hit album in 2009 which hit the charts at number three and almost immediately went gold. It contained (if just barely) the high-octane hook laden singles \\"Oh Yeah\\", \\"Sexy Little Thing\\" and \\"My Kinda Girl\\". from there they embarked on a string of live shows that ended a year later. They proved with that one album that a super group could do more than show case four super star, virtuosos.<br /><br />During that whirlwind tour, as Hagar put it, \\"We went from being a weekend fun-time thing to making a record and touring the world. Our learning curve was fast - even for us....We earned everything we got, and along the way, we established a trust in one another that happens rarely in bands.\\"<br /><br />So, Chickenfoot set out to make a high minded heart pounding follow up, they did it right. They challenged each other to be even better, and that is exactly what they accomplished. There's a cohesiveness on this album that demands that it be listened to in its entirety. Don't get me wrong, there are plenty of tunes that will no doubt be radio favorites, make great singles, but to really appreciate it, listen to it all the way through.<br /><br />There is bluesy, ballsy stadium rock, there is earth quaking, riff driven monstrous rock anthems, there are bone crushers, but with a spiritual undertone, there's also biting sarcasm and social commentary.theere's Joe Satriani at his shredding best, there is Michael Anthony at his lowdown best and Chad Smith everywhere he should be and there is Sammy Hagar, singing in ways I am not sure I ever heard him sing.There are great rock ballads, country dipped pop, and straight ahead classic rock.<br /><br />Most of all, this is album rock that will take a long time to get old.ing best, there is Michael Anthony at his lowdown best and Chad Smith everywhere he should be and there is Sammy Hagar, singing in ways I am not sure I ever heard him sing.There are great rock ballads, country dipped pop, and straight ahead classic rock.

0446556750|3.0|I love Michael Connelly and I loved the first book about the Lincoln Lawyer, but I felt that the author took the easy way out: criminal dead, everyone happy etc. etc.  There were some plot lines that might have yielded some intrigue and lent complexity to the novel but they were left hanging.  It read to me like a screenplay, lots of dialogue and scene setting and less substance than in earlier novels.  Was this guy a serial killer or not? was he going to take a daughter or someone hostage? It just left me very unsatisfied.
B005HPA2XI|5.0|Well... who didn't see the mixed reviews coming on this one.  I enjoy when a band, such as Mastodon, or Opeth, steps outside of the box and creates a different/concept album.  It's a different case when you talk about Mastodon and Opeth (this will be the last time I mention Opeth since it is a Mastodon review).  Mastodon created this album because they chose to.  Does this mean you will never hear a Remission, or Leviathan style album again?  No.  It's a good point in a band's career when they can sit down and create an album they really want to do, regardless of whatever negative flack they know they will receive from fans.  When I said this was I different case... their change in style for this album is by no means a step in the wrong direction, or any kind of dead end of their older style.  What I mean is... can Metallica ever make a Master again?  Absolutely not.  However, Mastodon can create another heavy, weird album again.  So for any of the faithfully hopeless fans who cling onto a band's single sound, or album, there may be hope that you will get what you want eventually.  As far as the album itself... more clean vocals and a much more simplistic song structure can be heard.  Each track is rather short as well.  Yet the album contains their signature guitar noodling, excellent drumming and some of the strongest vocal melodies I have heard yet on a Mastodon album.  Is this their best album?  No, but it is a great album.  Each Mastodon album stands out in its own right.  I can't say any album sound very similar(well, maybe Leviathan and Blood a bit).  Bottom line... just buy it.  Give it a few spins and conjure up your own opinion.  It's worth it.
B001AEF6IQ|5.0|My family and I love the Torchwood series. We first watched Torchwood: Miracle Day when it came out on Starz. I then looked it up and ordered the previous seasons. If you were a previous X-Files fan, I think you will like this show. The characters are engaging, and it is a very entertaining show. I just wish the seasons were longer!

1609611543|3.0|I'll leave a full review of this book to the sixty three other reviewers.  While I agree that American's eat all too much wheat, the advice was:  give up wheat cold turkey, and all other grains while you are at it, as well as fruit for the most part, and sugar of course.  Basically, eat veggies and lean uncured meat, don't worry about healthy fats like evoo.  OK, who can live like this????  Good for you if you can, but 99% of this country cannot.  I plan to cut way back on wheat, perhaps include it in one meal a day, moderation in all things.  For us dinner is entirely doable without wheat:  meat, salad, veggies.  But try sending veggies to school with your kid for snack time.  Raising kids on a wheat free diet is nearly impossible if you live in the modern world.  So save your money and get this book from the library, or go back and read the atkins/south beach books on your shelf.  Bottom line:  cut way, way back on the wheat products.  If you can or MUST cut them out all together, bravo, but most folks can't do that.
B004WOS3P4|5.0|This is a great CD.  I like all of the songs on it.  David Cook has a voice that touches my soul.  He has a voice that makes you want to sing along and sway with the music.  His voice is similar to Neil Diamond.  Keep up the good work.  I'm ready for the next CD to come out!

B004RLO0EA|3.0|Sadly, one of the orchestral backed tracks from the film, Sweet dreams, is hideously overcompressed by the studio.

B005ELZKWS|5.0|Before III came out, I read a rolling stone review of the album and was a little bummed.  I had low expectations going in.  I really liked the first release so I thought it would be tough to beat the first one.  After just one listen I must say they absolutely delivered on this one. Very solid effort by all.  The music sounds much more polished this time around.  It has a heavier vibe and the song writing appears more thought out, rather than just a fun jam session. If you like hard rock, nothing out there right now comes close to this, probably the best release of 2011. I really hope it will inspire others in this genre, hoping it will chart well like last time.

B0057MFA42|1.0|I bought this in addition to the super deluxe box set because I wanted the show on blu-ray and not just standard DVD.  I had read about the sync issues on the BD (after purchasing but before playing it), but was hoping it was just minor and that people were over-reacting.  Not the case.  It is HORRIBLE to watch!  You hear Dave hit the snare almost a full second before seeing it.  It's just inexcusable.  And no, it isn't my player or receiver.  I have watched countless other blu-rays on the same equipment and not a single one of them had audio/video sync issues.  I tried watching the BD in every sound/visual combination possible.  They were all the same; just bad.  I couldn't even finish it.  I put in the DVD that came with the super deluxe edition just out of curiosity.  Sure enough, there are no sync issues at all on the DVD.  The audio and video are in perfect time.  I'm with others that hope that there is a recall and reissue of this.  I was really looking forward to this on BD and now it's just going to collect dust, unless Best Buy will let me return it.  I would gladly buy a replacement if they fix the issue and reissue this.

B004SBQAN8|3.0|The film does a reasonable job of adapting the novel to the screen. It is not a blockbuster, however. The novel contains some really descriptive battle scenes, and CGI could have brought them to life much better than this film did. Also, the details of the box, and the orb that reveals the nature of their home galaxy, should have been included in the film. It leaves a big gap for subsequent films to overcome or fill in. I am looking forward to the next novel in the series, but have doubts if the number two and/or three will ever make it to the silver screen.

B000002KCC|5.0|In 1975 the mercurial Neil Young released an album that was the musical equivalent of banging one's head against a wall. The early seventies greeted Neil with the death of two friends (Bruce Berry, Danny Whitten) from a drug overdose and Tonight's The Night serves as their epitaph. Vocals and instruments lurch and fade through a sloppy mix in an album all about dead ends, dissolution, decay, entropy, and exhaustion.Song structures stumble and barely coalesce while Neil, never one for musical or vocal precision, \\"sings\\" intermittently on pitch in a shaky nasal warble; the instruments squawk and mutter back in kind.  Play this album at your next cocktail party with musical sophisticates and watch `em scatter!  Through much of the album the band sound stoned (they were) but it sure ain't no fun.     The opening track speaks of how, \\"I picked up the phone and heard that he died, out on the mainline\\", and Neil wants the listener right there with him to feel it. Like Sinatra, Mr. Young sings of the world on a string (\\"World On A String\\"). But it doesn't mean it's (a thing), only real, (in the way), that he feels from day to day. Neil borrows a tune (\\"Borrowed Tune\\") from The Rolling Stones (\\"Lady Jane\\") because \\"I'm alone in an empty room, too wasted to write my own.\\" (He hopes that it matters).  Good news! On the fifth song, \\"Come On Baby Let's Go Downtown\\", a cut live at the Fillmore East, Neil is back with an up tempo rocker. Neil and company are kickin' out the jams! Turns out to be a desperate song about scoring drugs, and Young's guitarist and singing partner (Whitten) will not long afterwards  be dead from an overdose of heroin. With \\"Mellow My Mind\\" perhaps Neil Young will find succor as, \\"I've been down the road and I've come back\\", but the vocal line sounds more like a man meandering down a blind alley, and in the next song , \\"It's too dark to put the keys in my ignition\\", anyway.  Near the end of the album, Neil half sings, half croaks to you/me/himself, \\"...open up the tired eyes\\" (\\"Tired Eyes\\") and laconically drawls out a story of a botched cocaine deal. He wonders aloud about the victim: \\"Was he a heavy doper, or just a loser? He was a friend of yours.\\"  Neil Young would sing elsewhere with more polish about \\"The Needle and The Damage Done\\", but this open wound of an album just glares at you with bloodshot eyes and crawls under your skin to gnaw.  Tonight's The Night joins other Heart of Darkness musical mess masterpieces such as Sly Stone's \\"There's A Riot Going On\\" (a commercial success) and Big Star's, \\"Sister Lovers\\" (not a commercial success). There's a liner (note)... torn, scrap of paper, \\"Even if they're sick they have to show. For Players and hustlers, tonight's the night.\\"

The mere sight of double pointed needles made me cower in fear, so you can imagine my astonishment when I decided I wanted to learn to knit socks.  Feeling totally irrational, I did a web search and this book showed up in the results.  I read alot of the reviews and realized that I had alot of sisters out there when it came to knitting socks.  I ordered the book and I'm not only sucessfully knitting socks, but having so much fun doing it!  This book changed what I felt was very difficult into something understandable and enjoyable.

I put the digital copy DVD into my macbook pro and it complained that it could no longer run PowerPC apps.  Apparently this DVD app is _old_ technology and needs to run on the PowerPC platform, which is no longer supported by Apple.  Okay, fine, I have a mac mini running a previous version of OS X that still does support the PowerPC framework.  But when the installer runs and asks for the Authorization Code from the card in the case, and I type it in (very carefully), it does not work.  I tried it several times and it never worked.

It works great for that, as long as you understand the limitations of your i-device.  My only complaint is that t can be difficult to tell the difference between the red audio cable and the red video cable because they look identical.  It would've been a better idea to make the audio cables all red and all white connecters instead of the same red/black as the video.  I've also used this to sync both my phone and iPad with my PC.  The USB connection works just like any other apple cable, and I had no issues.

B003H9M1QM|3.0|The quality of the restoration is excellent. Dumbo focuses around an African elephant baby mis-delivered by stork to an Indian elephant in a circus. Amazing that the \\"politically correct\\" Disney Studios, which refuses to re-release Song of the South because of Uncle Remus (who is portrayed as a happy black slave), released Dumbo with the \\"black\\" soulful crows. Obviously Dumbo represented q whole lot more money. Most of the background artists left things pretty much bland. Timothy Q. Mouse comes off repeatedly as larger than the elephants. As an animated feature, it has its place in the annals of cartoondom, but nothing that other works drew from. Neither are the two unrestored early Disney cartoons anything special, which lack the polish of the later Donald Duck and Mickey Mouse cartoons of the 1950's.  Also, for some reason, Disney animation writers have always had a misogynous hatred of mothers.  Snow White--dead mother  Cinderella--dead mother  Pinocchio--no mother/dead tree  Peter Pan--dead mother  The Little Mermaid--dead mother  Beauty and the Beast--dead mother  Bambi--dead mother  Finding Nemo--dead mother  Dumbo--insane mother  Up--dead, childless wife  Huey, Dewey and Louis--dead mother  Tarzan--dead mother  Hunchback of Notre Dame--dead mother and father  The Sword and the Stone--dead mother and father (dad died valiantly in battle; mom just bit the dust)  Alice in Wonderland--we're not quite sure, but probably  Lilo and Stitch--dead mother and dead father  Lady and the Tramp--unknown, but, regardless, the mother of each turned out to be a bitch

It dispels the protein and carbohydrate myths, and any other myth you may have been indoctrinated by. Atkins diet people? You need to listen up. The China Study suggests a way of eating you can keep for life. I know because I lost 35 lbs without even trying and am now down to my high school weight.

It really provides insight on the album. There isn't a bad song here. Something Gone Wrong is my favorite. It is an acoustic, 12 string piece, good lyrics, and a classic Joe guitar bridge. With overall tempo which I prefer. I do like the lyrical message on Three and Half Letters, (I Need a Job). I can't wait until Chickenfoot 2!  Or Chickenfoot 6!
0553381695|1.0|The first book of the series was pretty good. It held my interest, the character development was fine and all in all it was a good \\"popcorn\\" book. Looking back, I think I should have been a bit worried that Martin didn't wrap up as much as he could in the first book to focus on the next \\"bump\\" of the series. Before I continue, I just want to say that I think some readers don't understand that, even in a multi-book series, each book has, or should have, a plot for each book that can be completed within the one book. Then when the last book comes about all of the stories come together to make one complete, grand ending. That's writing, that's good writing anyway. So far, nothing is even near being resolved. Not a good sign for things to come...<br /><br />I couldn't finish the book. I don't think reading to the end would have made me change my opinion. I was over half-way finished and just couldn't bring myself to get through the rest. Sometimes people forget that there are millions and millions of books out there and I don't have time to humor a bad book. Also, it doesn't even matter really if I didn't finish because, as I have said earlier, nothing wraps up in the end. Just more questions and \\"cliff-hangers.\\"<br /><br />Martin needs to stop with the alternating points of view. I think the stories would have been fine following one character per book. It can be done. I've seen it. By jumping from one character to another, he lost me every single time. I would be intrigued by Jon or Tyrion--Arya had some interesting things going on too--only to reach the end of the chapter and turn the page to find another dull and pointless account from Cat's point of view. After awhile, I just didn't care enough to make it through the filler to get to the story again.<br /><br />There were too many pages that were dedicated to banners and family lineage of characters that don't matter, of paragraphs of what foods people were eating or what clothes they wore and what colors meant to whom. Those kinds of things, in the long-run, don't matter. Not in this series and certainly not for that length. I actually blame the editor for this more than Martin.<br /><br />I don't agree that this series, even the first book, was so amazing that it rivals the likes of Tolkien's ring series or even Le Guin's fantasy. It was merely good and, after the first book, definitely not worth reading. There are better works out there, and you don't even have to just rely on classics. This is not a dying genre, it is just that, for some reason, books such as this steal the thunder of every other book and many good ones go unnoticed.

It is what it is. You may enjoy hearing yourself espouse your opinion, but it doesn't mean a thing.  Like every Primus album, it will take a half dozen listens to get your bearing - to be able to distinguish the nuances between tracks, etc. Pretty much standard operating procedure, even for the die hard fan.  There is nothing missing here (except, arguably the ginseng drummer). This is a Primus album. The next Primus album. Primus sucks, and you know this. Or, you don't.

While it is neither a coming-of-age work nor a \\"child is father to the man\\" novel, author Lee Child takes his readers back to a point in time and a series of events that find Reacher on the track he has followed over the course of 15 books. It also establishes once and for all that while Reacher has certainly earned and deserved his status as an archetypal thriller protagonist, he is at his core a detective and one of the more capable in modern fiction. It is not that he is incapable of error; on the contrary, he errs early and often. It is his ability to step back from mistakes and right his course that separates him from his peers. This, coupled with a classic murder mystery, makes THE AFFAIR one of the most noteworthy books of 2011.  The book takes place over the course of a few days in March 1997, when Reacher, still within the purview of the United States Army, is assigned to go undercover in Carter Crossing, Mississippi, a small town near an Army base used for the training and unofficial deployment of Special Forces troops to Kosovo. A woman has been brutally murdered in Carter Crossing, and the killer appears to be a soldier from the base. An investigator has been assigned there, but Reacher is acting as an undercover investigator within the town and given orders to find out everything he can, manage the local police, and get lost.  Reacher is troubled by the assignment from the jump, and becomes even more so when he begins investigating on his own. The local sheriff, meanwhile, is an ex-Marine named Elizabeth Deveroux, a very savvy and attractive woman whose charms are not lost on Reacher. But Deveroux seems to have some secrets, and when Reacher finds that the murder he is investigating is only the latest in a series, he knows that there is much more to the quiet town of Carter Crossing than he had initially suspected.  When his investigation leads back to the military base and an officer with strong connections to Washington, D.C., Reacher realizes that this is no ordinary investigation: the powers-that-be don't want to uncover the truth, and in fact are set on burying it. Reacher, though a U.S. Army officer, holds his ultimate allegiance to the truth, which puts him in direct conflict with his superior, among others. It is the manner in which the book plays out that puts Reacher on the road --- figuratively and literally --- with which Child's legions of readers are familiar.  Child does amazing things with THE AFFAIR. Fans know that Reacher survives the conclusion of the story, given all that has passed in the previous installments of the series. Yet Child manages to instill more suspense than readers would think imaginable. He builds his story slowly but methodically, eschewing explosions, martial arts and derring-do for the first quarter of the novel while never sacrificing the pacing of the narrative. The core of the story, though, is the murder mystery at hand, and it is there that THE AFFAIR really shines. In the course of utilizing storytelling methods both deservedly classic and very contemporary, Child introduces new dimensions to Reacher while staying true to the old.    --- Reviewed by Joe Hartlaub
B002I0J5FG|5.0|ON ICO  When I first played Ico in 2001, I was hooked. I played it at least three times a year every year up until now, and refused to give up my copy even after my PS2 bit the dust, so you can imagine how delighted I was to finally get my hands on this new, updated version, because it is absolutely fantastic. When I saw how clear the graphics were, my jaw actually dropped. I had always thought the scenery in ICO was beautiful, but when I saw the updated version, I was completely blown away. I played it from start to finish last night, taking about 4 1/2 hours. It usually doesn't take me this long, as I've played ICO so many times that I know every word of the dialogue, but I spent a lot of time looking at the gorgeous environments and also I was hunting for surprises that may have been added (there weren't any). The only changes that I noticed were that the black spirits were a lot tougher to defeat than in the old version, maybe because nearly all of them have the ability to fly, and ICO stays on the ground longer when attacked by them. The other changes were some subtle puzzle changes, one of which kind of ticked me off because it involved bouncing on this peg that sends you flying straight up in the air, in the hope of catching hold of a wall where you shimmy up to get outside of the building. It took me at least ten minutes to jump at the exact time I needed to in order to get up to grab that ledge, by which time I was fuming, mostly because I really detest being hindered in a game I have probably beaten about 40 times. Other than that, I really had a ball. The details you see in the improved graphics add so much to the game.   ON SHADOW OF THE COLOSSUS  I haven't played the new version yet, but I cannot say enough good things about this game, having played it at least twice a year since its release, but I am certain that I will enjoy it as much as I did ICO.  ON BOTH GAMES IN GENERAL  These two games have retained their places in the line-up of my top ten favorite games of all time. I have never played games that were so original, so simple, and yet so beautiful. When I play them, I really feel the sadness that Ico and Yorda and Wander are feeling. I feel as much a part of their worlds as they do, and want to explore every corner of every mountain and valley and building just like them. These games transport me to places that are so mystifying, so empty, yet so charged with emotion and excitement that I cannot get enough of them. For me, they are like walking straight into the most beautiful painting I ever saw, and playing a video game there. After awhile, I almost forget that I AM playing a game. These games do not follow the typical video game formula of inventories, endless weapon upgrades, torrents of dialogue, innumerable sidequests, etc. In each game, you are given a single quest. In ICO: Escape the castle. In Shadow of the Colossus: Destroy 16 Colossi to save your beloved.  Both of them also have endings that leave you with more questions than answers, but they are still satisfying nonetheless. You really must try them! Play ICO first. If you get stuck on a puzzle, there's always help on the Internet, but play it out till the end-you won't be disappointed! And stick around till after the credits roll...I won't spoil the surprise.
0385341679|5.0|A perfect ending to a perfect series. GREAT JOB Karen! I stumbled across you accidentally with your book, Beyond the Highland Mist. After that, I had to order your books from the bookstore because that was the only one they had. I believe there were 3 other ones at the time, and Grimm became and still is my favorite character. When I finished with those ones, I pre-ordered every time you had a new one coming out, to make sure I got it as soon as it came out. You are by far my most favorite author and now I can't wait until Dani's series comes out. Please don't let other bad reviews bring you down. You are a GREAT writer and you have an amazing fan base that will support you always. For every possible new fan that review sent away, your fan base will double for you every time we lend our books to friends to read. I have lent my books out so often I have to purchase new ones because they are literally falling apart. I, personally, have re-read all your books at least half a dozen times. So please, keep your spirits up, and keep writing instead of listening to petty nonsense. We can't have that influencing your writing or taking up much needed time to get these new books written and out on time. Keep up the great work. All your fans LOVE YOU VERY MUCH!!!!!!!!

B0016J81B4|4.0|I wanted the Bistro clog to keep out rocks, sticks, etc.  I wore them 18 hours a day for one week and they fulfilled this need admirably.  They were hotter than the models I have worn that had ventilation holes (but also let in rocks and crud).  The trade off for me was worth it.  I think the features for working in a kitchen were indeed helpful for the kitchen: a beefed-up toe, non slip soles,etc.  I liked the soles but they did pick up more debris outside than other models but that is the tradeoff that goes with this model.  With all those hours, my feet felt great, although I did get some abrasion from wearing them non-stop.  I think they are perfect for the intended purpose.  When I need more ventilation, I just put on a different pair of Crocs!

B005H5GEQM|5.0|There seems to be a lot of confusion regarding this title because of the way Amazon uses one review system for multiple different versions of this title, and that people are commenting on one, which probably does not apply to the other. This review refers specifically to the version titled \\"Senna [2010, UK] DVD\\" in Amazon's system. This DVD is pretty good. Not perfect, but really good. YOU NEED TO SELECT \\"PORTUGUESE\\" audio when you watch this DVD. This movie is a foreign movie. It is ***NOT*** in English. At least 90% of it. If you select the \\"ENGLISH\\" language track, you will be treated to the director's commentary (a really superb feature by the way). This is apparently the official Singapore release. It will play just fine in the USA however, and overall video and audio quality is excellent. Don't worry. Singapore is an English speaking country. There is only English lettering on the DVD menus and the cover. Some of the English subtitles are a bit weird. Very understandable though, and this is a super minor complaint. Anyway, I highly recommend this particular DVD. I can't speak for any others. As for the movie itself --- this is the best documentary I've ever seen. Period.

B004J4WKTW|5.0|There is no doubt about it-I AM ENCHANTED BY THIS BOOK.  I am never sure how much I will like a book tied to the imaginary because often times I find it too far fetched to connect with.  For example books like Hitchhikers guide to the Galaxy and EON are highly rated, but they come across as blather I cannot follow.  The Night Circus is a whole different circus tent!<br /><br />For me, this book kneaded together the best elements of Something Wicked this Way Comes, The Illusionist and a Cirque du Soleil show.  After baking these elements together a most wonderful, melt in you mouth story is produced.  At the start, Celia, a five year-old girl, whose mother has committed suicide is left with her estranged father, Prospero the Enchanter.  Prospero is obviously not interested in being a father and soon concocts a plan to use the girl in a challenge of abilities which involves another magician, Alexander (i.e.the man in the grey suit).  Each magician is to train an apprentice and they will be pitted against each other to the death, unbeknownst to the competitors.<br /><br />Alexander chooses a boy from a local orphanage who names himself, Marco.  The two apprentices are trained in very different ways and are unaware of who they are being trained to compete against.  Celia's father is brutal and pushes the girl to extremes.  Marco is isolated with books and is required to study relentlessly with very little human contact.  As the two apprentices grow, Marco figures out who he has been pitted against, but cannot help being attracted to his competitor.  By the time Celia figures out who she is competing against, she too is attracted to what is not good for her.  Then ensues Celia's quest to find a way to get Marco and herself out of a competition that will ruin what they most desire, to be with one another.<br /><br />The imagery in the book was absolutely gorgeous.  The descriptions of the tents and circus acts left me wanting to be a revuer, so that I can attend time and time again.  I never felt like I could not imagine what the author was describing, nor did I ever feel overwhelmed or bored by the descriptions.  I cannot believe how perfect I found this story to be.  There were at least a few times I had to stop reading, simply to sigh with pleasure, not to mention the times I was brought to tears.  The love story is very gentle and subdued, which I believe is a representation of the time period in which the story takes place, although there is obviously a magnetic attraction between the two young illusionists.  It was both tragic and beautiful the way the they tried to resist each other.  Sigh.....I want more.  I would love to see this made in to a movie.ke I could not imagine what the author was describing, nor did I ever feel overwhelmed or bored by the descriptions.

B003ZSJ212|1.0|I've never purchased the original trilogy on DVD, as I wanted to spend my money only once on a pristine edition of the three films I remember from my childhood. I'm saddened by George Lucas opting to not include the versions we purists prefer. And really, it's not so much a case of hating on his digitally 'updated' renditions; it has more to do with omitting pieces of theatrical history. It's as though Lucas has gone to work in George Orwell's world of 1984, rewriting history so many times that nobody can remember what the truth was anymore. Boo. Nay.

B0052VUNHC|1.0|The author took out one of the more interesting aspects of the story. I had imagined readers were going to get a rich and fast-paced world-building of underground boxing that would be tied in with a wonderful romance. Definitely not. In the beginning the characters draw you in. Abby is strong-willed and outspoken. Travis is a good-looking bad boy. Two characters with a lot of potential. I wanted it to be great. I did. Unfortunately I found myself beginning to walk backwards, retreating from the characters that I had begun to connect to. Half way through the book the characters' strong feelings for each other quickly turn into an uncomfortable and immature possession. There are no layers or complexities in their relationship. A big focus on sex, sexual attraction, and their anger and violent tendencies and immature reactions lead to steamy lustful sex. Sorry. None of it is the least bit romantic to me.   I agree with the select few who expressed concern that this book was given such rave reviews. In the end I didn't care for the characters or the story. I wish I could say otherwise.
B001JEPVDM|5.0|In Shake Hands with the Devil, an  account of the Rwandan genocide, General Romeo Dallaire vividly reveals to the reader the total failure of the international community to stop the genocide. He gives a succinct outline of the failures of the international community, including the United Nations, the UN Security Council, and many NGOs, and bravely holds nations like France responsible for doing nothing despite the strong influence they had on the Hutu extremist Rwandan government which ended up killing over 800,000 minority Tutsis and moderate Hutus. Dallaire distinguished himself as someone with a great deal of courage who went through hell without breaking and goes further to relive the hell in this book so that we might learn from it.  This book is a must read if you have an interest in improving the lot of the United Nations and if you have faith in a better and more efficient United Nations influence in the future in resolving international issues. From this book, I got a good account of the Rwanda genocide. It raised my curiosity about  other cover ups in Africa. From Triple Agent Double Cross, I learned of  atrocities committed by France in Cameroon. I am  reading about the Herero massacres at the turn of the last century. Overall, Shake Hands with the Devil is an eye-opener.

B000FC2PKG|5.0|Lisa Gardner's \\"Alone\\" is an amazing crime story. It all began with the death of Jimmy Gagnon, son of Judge Gagnon. Jimmy was killed by State trooper Bobby Dodge who with a tactical swat team was trying to defuse a supposedly domestic abuse hostage crisis. But the judge and his wife believe Jimmy's wife, Catharine Gagnon engineered the crisis to get rid of their son, so they want their only grandson taken from her. They start by suing Bobby Dodge and with that unfolded incidences which invokes Catherine's past as a victim of a pedophile half a century back.<br /><br />Embroiled in the mystery of the unfolding drama is the lurking presence of the serial rapist, manipulation by the late Jimmy's parents, the helplessness of the grandson, Catherine's calculating nature and Bobby Dodge's determination to resolve the mysteries behind all the deaths around. Alone and Triple Agent Double Cross brought a good end to my readings this September. I got thrilled until the last pages of the book.

0385534639|3.0|Morgenstern has created a menagerie of enchantment embodied in an establishment of luxury and curiosity where indulgence is ordinary. The Night Circus is a mysterious anomaly, fragile and captivating. It links fantasy with reality, while also breaking the boundaries of possibility. After all, this is what we want magic to become, an irrational escape from a mundane existence. The circus, or concrete vehicle used to convey theme is nothing new and has been utilized by writers for years. This is mostly due to the richness of imagery a circus provides.  It is universal and offers a setting that takes little effort to construct. The bones of the circus can branch in several directions, spanning mystery, horror, humor and fantasy. Readers drawn to imagery will be pulled into this alternative world.  Where I found The Night Circus lacking, was in plot pacing.  The competition trudges, little thrill occurs, and the chemistry between Celia and Marco is stagnant.  Parts of the story dragged, which was disappointing because the opportunity for tension was very possible. Sadly, The Night Circus falls short on the grand scale love story claim as well. If you are looking for exciting twists and turns, you're not likely to find it here.  Pretty, but predictable.

B001GF7WRW|4.0|I am not an audiophile so this review is not technical. All I can say is I am enjoying music and movies more now with these cans (picked up the slang while doing research for these).  With these I am picking up the words more clearly and of course the songs I have been listening have different meaning to them(slightly exaggerating here.  You definitely need to adjust the equalizer to get the sound you want since that does make a lot of difference.  The contruction is solid and I don't feel them too much while wearing them.  The only issue is that I do feel them around my ear since they do warm up the area around my ear.  Hopefully with extensive use I will get used to the pressure or the tension will loosen up a bit.

B0053Q9DHW|5.0|The first 15-20 minutes weren't as instantly engaging as other versions I've seen of the story (although the cinematography is splendid), but it grew on me.  Once the fated couple meet, it gets very good.  At any rate, the storyline is mixed through a series of flashbacks and techniques that are common enough these days, but it serves this version well in that it saves the best for last and adds some originality (if you've seen every previous rehashing of this tale). I wasn't crazy about the lead actress as Jane at first, but she definitely grew on me and she was solid overall.    The dialogue in this film far surpasses those in previous versions (of Jane Eyre) and it differs enough that it feels a bit more original while also capturing new nuances.  Also, this is the first version where I can understand and feel the burning romance--what the attraction really is--versus just hearing about it (and taking their word for it), because there is such a recognition in each other of stifled passion for life (in both characters).  The romance is the most satisfying too compared with other takes on this story. I'd say it's a solid 4 1/2, maybe a five over time, since it keeps growing on me!  Very satisfying and I can definitely watch it over and over.
B004ZN9Q3K|5.0|With 400+ 4- and 5-star reviews on this album, there's nothing I'm going to say to convince anyone of the artistic merit here.  I will say that I don't buy the \\"Birth of Pink Floyd\\" hype associated with this one.  Heck, listen to \\"Set The Controls for the Heart of the Sun\\" and you will hear the roots of both \\"Shine On You Crazy Diamond\\" and \\"Another Brick In the Wall.\\"  And there's many other example of this.  So while this remains the most popular album that no one seems to have heard of, Floyd didn't eaxactly come out of nowhere with this one.  But that's not what I came to say.....  I was a bit dubious as to how much better this remaster could really be, given that I own the original CD pressing, the 1992 \\"Shine On\\" remaster, the 1995 remaster, and the Mobile Fidelity Gold pressing.  Upon starting this album, \\"One of These Days\\" really creeps up on you...but from the start, the bass line seems to have a bit more depth, resonanance, and resolution.  Then, when Nick first comes in on the drums -- holy cow!  It's like a punch to the side of the head.  \\"A Pillow of Winds\\" has beautiful, shimmering guitar and some of the small nuances, such as the roto-tom hit at the start of the second verse really make you sit up and take notice at just how wonderful this remaster sounds.  By the time \\"Fearless\\" and \\"Echoes\\" roll around, forget about it -- I'm sold; this is easily the best version of this record ever.  It's as though a few layers of murk have been removed with each release to finally reveal this beauty at the core.  A record that was made in 1971 just doesn't have any business sounding this good today, and on my CAR stereo, no less!  Highly recomended and well worth the $9.99 I paid.
B0050SYS5A|4.0|BEFORE THE ZOOM  I had the kinect mounted on top of a 60'' big screen TV.  The room has 9' of space from the TV to the couch with nothing obstructing.  It worked well for one player, hand-tracking games like Child of Eden or fruit ninja.  It worked horribly for me when I played Dance Central.  It always thought my knees were my feet.  I think part of the reason it couldn't see me is that I am such a big guy (6'4\\", 350 lbs).    For two player games it didn't work well because when we backed up our legs blended into the couch.  I don't think it was seeing the floor clearly.  WITH THE ZOOM  Dance central worked perfectly.  My large frame no looked like a normal sized player.  Single-player fruit ninja worked well, although the player was noticeably smaller on the screen so you had to move more.  The bonus was it seemed more responsive and you could use your feet much better to kick the fruit (super fun).  Fruit Ninja with two players was a disaster.  Our player shadows kept popping in and out and it was incredibly annoying.  I tried Kinect sports with the zoom, 2 player.  I had never played it before without the zoom so have no comparison point.  It seemed accurate enough, although in volleyball it would make my player jump whenever I took a step.  I can confirm what has been said in other review that the Zoom makes hand tracking worse.  I experienced this when navigating through menus and using the kinect hub on the dashboard.  Also with the zoom I had to turn off one of the lamps in the room because of back lighting.  This wasn't an issue without the kinect  OVERALL:  I'm happy I bought it, if for no other reason than to play dance central.  I will be taking my zoom on and off depending on which game I play.
B005G4TJI4|1.0|the title of the disk pack is totally wrong.<br />It should be Blue Ray + DVD and digital copy available for DL<br /><br />a 210gb download to get the digital copy instead of including it, to me is lame.<br />you enter a very long url, then input the code and start the download manager<br />after it is finished you have to enter the long url again when you try to play the movie, and get a error 404 website not found<br /><br />I can get to any other web site I enter, but not to the Transformers site so now the digital copy will not play because the site cannot be accessed.<br /><br />Paramount should take lessons from Fox on how to include the digital copy
B005D51JQQ|2.0|First, I am a huge Sting fan from the 70's. I saw the Police when I was a teenager and the band left an indelible impression on me, mostly because Sting was just so amazing. Second, I have seen him more times than I can count--having followed him to NYC and to San Francisco to see him play live. Third, I think he's one of the true greats when it comes to song writing. BUT...I think I've reached my limit. To repackage all his solo work and then charge a premium for it is simply ridiculous. Three CDS and a DVD for more than $100? I'm shocked. But not as shocked as I was when I went to buy tickets for Sting's show in support of this work--$300 for two tickets! All of this just got me thinking that this is an exercise in commerce as opposed to art. Or, the man has finally lost it. It's been years since he's released a relevant set of tunes. His dabblings in Celtic folk music were simply dirge-lilke and dull and beyond seeing Sting sing with a live orchestra, that Symphonicities CD is the LAST thing I would put on when wanting to hear Sting sing the hits. So I'm confused by this boxed set. There's really nothing new here for the ears to listen to, other than a simple remastering of the tracks, which--face it--really doesn't sound all that different. Maybe Sting should have just charged $60 for this set since that is now his age. I just think that since he did the Police reunion tour that Sting has simply run out of creative gas and we've been handed nothing but dribbles of artistic energy as opposed to the gorgeousness and lush songs that he was capable of a decade ago. I still love the man and I'll forever cherish him for his contributions, but the heavy price tag for this set and the show accompanying just smells of capitalism infringing upon the artist's soul. Who knows, maybe this is all his label's doing or he's overstepped his donations to the rain forest. But whatever the reason, I don't feel stung in the least by what's being offered.
0312370849|5.0|This is a fictional account based on the real tragic events of the Velodrome d'Hiver roundup on July 16, 1942, in Occupied France during the Holocaust. A touching and gripping story unfolds as the author switches back and forth from a 10 year old Jewish girl's narrative to Julia's narrative, the reporter, who is hell-bent on finding out the girl's story and what happened to her 60 years later. During this process, Julia uncovers her family's hidden past and comes to term with her own life.  I had a hard time putting this one down. The author has done a wonderful job intertwining both stories together. This haunting story will forever stay with me and I highly recommend it! Never forget!
B00005YXZH|4.0|I am a casual Wilco fan. Over the years I've picked up most of their albums, but I've never gotten into them enough to really know any of them except this one and A.M.<br /><br />I write this review from the aspect that the reason I've really gotten to know this album is precisely because it is the one I turn to the most when I feel like listening to Wilco or just when I am in the mood to listen to a relatively laid back rock album that seems to feel perfect on a cool winter's day.<br /><br />Yankee Hotel Foxtrot is an album that presents itself in layers.  I've always know it as such, and it really reveals itself on repeat listenings.  Yet, I think this really became evident for me because of a few recent events...<br /><br />1. A new stereo system at home really brought the album out to me<br />2. Viewing of the documentary that accompanied the making of this album<br />3. The release of The Whole Love<br /><br />I recently reviewed how fantastic the production and engineering on the Whole Love is.  Well, I think it is everybit as great here.  Everything feel just right.  This goes along with what I think are the best singing I've heard from Jeff and some fantastic lyrics.  Listening to the album in light of those three items just makes the album sound and feel even better.  Its a complete package.<br /><br />You don't have to be a Wilco fan to enjoy this Cd.  This is the type of music that anyone who likes a good rock album could potentially like, even if Wilco doesn't seem like your cup of tea.  Songs like Kamera and Heavy Metal Drummer are good way to step into this band and album.
B002BVYBC4|4.0|While this movie is not super plausible and definitely not an Oscar winner, it is very entertaining between fast cars and racing and watching the actors strut their stuff.  It is not one that you watch to enrich your life, you watch it because it's just a lot of fun and a great escape!
B004G5ZXVQ|4.0|With the recent news that R.E.M. has called it quits as a band, I decided I'd review the album that has been perhaps my most played of 2011.<br /><br />A band like R.E.M. has now made so many albums over such a long period, that the opinions on this one album will be quite varied and strong.  I've never been a die hard fan in the sense that I know every song or lyric the band ever wrote, but I've loved them enough to own every album and enjoy every album for what they are worth.<br /><br />Collapse Into Now may be an appropriately titled album because in creating what I feel is one of their best albums (definitely my favorite in the post Bill Berry era), they have achieved something that many older bands strive to achieve but fail at...<br /><br />R.E.M. have seemingly created an album that is anchored in the present in terms of sound and lyrics that somehow still captures the essence of R.E.M. over their complete career.  It is as if they really collapsed themselves and their career into one package full of a wonderful collection of songs that seems to be as good as anything in 2011 is.  When I listen to this album I find myself at times enjoying the genius of Michael Stipes lyrics and their appropriateness for the times we are in, yet on each listening I always find myself pleasantly remembering how great R.E.M. has always been and how great they were and how great they are as they retire their band.<br /><br />Ultimately, the biggest strength of this album is that it stands alone.  It is cohesive and it feels like it comes from the heart.  It feels like the music of a band that can embrace its past without feeling the need to repeat it.  It is a wonderful album that stands amongst the bands best (but whether it is absolutely the best is up to you).<br /><br />The biggest flaw many fans of many bands make is the worry about where an album stands with respect to the catalog.  Bands evolve even if their sound doesn't, and even good albums such as this can be criticized for not being the epic 5 star album that something like Automatic For the People or Murmur may be to you.  Enjoy this album for what it is now.  You won't be sorry.hing like Automatic For the People or Murmur may be to you.  Enjoy this album for what it is now.  You won't be sorry.
B005G4TJI4|5.0|Yes there are no special features on this movie! I will admit I love special features, they add a lot to the movies and just simply make the whole experience more awesome overall! With that being said, if you can't wait for em and are too cheap to shell out extra money for both versions, then don't complain just be patient and wait for them to come out later in the year. One heads up for those who want to buy this now but also want the special features addition is that this version comes with a $10 coupon insert to be used for the special features addition that releases later this year. The movie is completely brilliant in the blu ray format, well worth buying. The 20 to 25 dollar price range that you can find this movie for is more than acceptable considering it comes with the movie in 3 different formats. Up to this point amazon provides the best market price I have for the movie although Best Buy is pretty close too. Don't miss out on the \\"Now\\" by waiting for the special features addition, just buy this one, enjoy it and save up for the next release and take advantage of the $10 coupon this one comes with. Also you could save the coupon, sell this one later and essentially end up paying small pocket change for the special features addition after you get your resale money plus the $10 coupon, not that bad of deal if you ask me.
B005EHNMWM|4.0|I can't say I am a huge Wilco fan, and I definitely don't want to start digging into how this album is better than album X or doesn't live up to album Y (insert your own X and Y there).  I do own all of their albums, and I generally find them all to be great.  I've never really had a favorite as I find my mood often dictates what I want to listen to and how much I'll enjoy it.<br /><br />With that out of the way, I was excited to find a new Wilco Album in the mail this week and have even grown in appreciation of the band after listening to this album (and watching the documentary on the making of Yankee Hotel Foxtrot).  This album is fantastic.  I've listened to it a half dozen times and each time I find myself liking a different song and being hooked on different facets of others.<br /><br />This is a case where an album grabs me as opposed to a specific song.  I think it is the excellent production that has gone into it.  As I find most important in albums, the unit is very cohesive and works well together.  It pulls me in right upfront with the Art of Almost and sometimes I haven't noticed where I'm at until One Sunday Morning has ended, nearly an hour later.  In the middle I find myself loving the lyrics of Jeff Tweedy, the musicianship shown by the whole band (I really love the use of Organ and Piano in many places) and as I am now learning to appreciate the little sounds added here and there that make for a unique masterpiece.<br /><br />So, I'll let others decide whether this ranks in Wilco's catalog. I just know that it is an album I'll enjoy in the now and I'll definitely enjoy in the future.  It is going to be one of the best of 2011 amongst a flurry of already wonderful releases.<br /><br />As for the deluxe edition:  I love the bonus disc.  I'm glad they aren't part of the main album, but they definitely aren't the typical B-Side type junk that many artists like to include.  This is a testament to Wilco's skills and talents.  Perhaps why I can't decide what their best album really is, is because they aren't capable of writing many bad songs.se they aren't capable of writing many bad songs.
B004G25V9S|5.0|When I first listened to Heritage I was not happy. Being a long time fan, it was not the album that I wanted from Opeth. I wanted to hear more thunderous double bass and Mikael's amazing death vocals. I grudgingly gave it a few more listens and my view point slowly changed. I have been sucked into the layers of melodies and progressive jazz fusion. I can honestly say this album is a true work of art. Now I say that Heritage IS the album I wanted from Opeth. It's given me a renewed interest in them. It's different than their earlier works but undoubtedly Opeth. Just listen with an open mind and you'll be pleasantly surprised!!! This is highly recommended.
B0049OSQ18|5.0|I'll have to admit that when I had heard the Decemberists were making a new album last winter and had titled it The King is Dead, I had grand hopes for the next great concept album after the euphoria the Hazards of Love had given me before.<br /><br />So when I obtained this album and found it was not a concept album at all, I was a bit letdown and disappointed.  Fortunately, the first song, \\"Don't Carry It All\\", erased that disappointment almost instantly.  This album is fantastic from start to finish and has been one of many fantastic albums of 2011 that I've enjoyed (I can't believe how good the music this year has been).<br /><br />As I've listened to this album over the months, I think I find that it not being a concept album is actually a relief.  As much as I love The Hazards of Love; that album requires an almost continuous listen for my enjoyment.  Here is an album that has songs that are just as good as any Decemberists album before, yet I don't feel the urgency to dedicate myself to it on each listen.  It has increased my joy as well as discovery of it.  This album is as cohesive as any great album (concept or not), yet many of the songs can stand wonderfully on their own.<br /><br />Last, unlike much of the Decemberists music, this album doesn't have the darkness I've come to expect.  It has its emotion and it isn't a fully joyous occasion, but I definitely love the feeling I have when listening to it and appreciate the change in mood.  I really notice that appeal when listening to the radio and hearing a track from this album pop up.  I can throw on this album whenever I want and enjoy it.
B005NA3B8U|4.0|great port of the game, I want to give it 5 stars but the fact that your fingers will get in the way if you seeing just keeps it from being perfect for me. if you're a fan at all you wont be disappointed. great game. no issues on my old DROID or new DROID bionic.
086571701X|5.0|I have to admit, I was skeptical when I heard this book was coming out.  Up until now, most of the information on the subject of Aquaponics has existed mostly on the Internet, and rife with conflicting information. Sylvia Bernstein has collaborated with Aquaponics experts from around the world (including Murray Hallam of Practical Aquaponics in Australia) to create a definitive how-to guide for the everyman. In addition to the encyclopedia of knowledge gained from intense research, Sylvia also includes colorful pictures, illustrations, an easy to understand guide, and humorous quips based on her own experiences growing vegetables and fish together.  To say that I am impressed is an understatement. Whether you are an Aquaponics beginner who just wants to grow food in your backyard, or a seasoned professional, you will want to have this book in your library.  Chris

B005CMSDKA|4.0|Hanna a very different thriller that plays like a twisted fairy tale. Hanna is played perfectly by Saoirse Roan. Directed by Joe Wright, Atonement, If you didn't know better you would swear he had directed action before. The movie does have a lot of action. Filmed very well, not that shaky camera stuff either. The plot is a little thin and the ending is pretty much predictable. The acting was really good again. Eric Banna no stranger to action, and Cate Blanchete who plays the villain over the top but you can tell she had fun with it. The movie is being called a art house action movie because after Hanna thinks she takes care of her problems she has to trek across Europe mostly with a very odd family where Hanna Learns about the world and how ill prepared she is to deal with it. Just when things start to fell slow the movie kicks back into action until its ending. The cinematography is insanely beautiful. Form the Cold winter wonderland to the scorching desert, Hanna's whole journey looks amazing on Blu ray. The score is one of the best I have heard, somewhat like Tron Legacy's score, its loud and will get your heart pumping. My only problems were I had a slight disconnect with the family Hanna stays with and I thought it shouldn't have been so predictable. Overall the movie has great action, and action with a coming of age movie, really changes the feel in this original movie. Grade: A-

B003XT60KO|5.0|Economics in One Lesson by Henry Hazlitt simply MUST be read by anyone who wants to understand a very basic economic principle. What is the one lesson that rules them all? It is this: The art of economics consists in looking not merely at the immediate but at the longer effects of any act or policy; it consists in tracing the consequences of that policy not merely for one group but for all groups.<br /><br />Imagine that! Tracing the consequences of economic policies all throughout an economy and not only focusing on its immediate, short-term effects! Every politician who actually cares about this country and wants to help it, needs to memorized that sentence and live it! They won't. It won't get them re-elected. Short-term benefits with long-term harms are what got us where we are today. The American people continue to keep themselves economically ignorant and re-elect whoever promises to bring home the bacon. Welcome to 14.4 Trillion in debt and unemployment through the roof. Can you say, \\"long-term harms are coming home to roost?\\"<br /><br />After introducing the one lesson early on in the book, Hazlitt proceeds to give example after example of this principle in practice. Each one is clearly stated and well-argued. That the book was originally written in 1946 amazes me. The prescience of the author is why the book is just as relevant today.<br /><br />Hazlitt concludes with, \\"The analysis of our illustrations has taught us another incidental lesson. This is that, when we study the effects of various proposals, not merely on special groups in the short run, but on all groups in the long run, the conclusions we arrive at usually correspond with those of unsophisticated common sense. It would not occur to anyone unacquainted with the prevailing economic half-literacy that it is good to have windows broken and cities destroyed; that it is anything but waste to create needless public projects; that it is dangerous to let idle hordes of men return to work; that machines which increase the production of wealth and economize human effort are to be dreaded; that obstructions to free production and free consumption increase wealth; that a nation grows richer by forcing other nations to take its goods for less than they cost to produce; that saving is stupid or wicked and that squandering brings prosperity.\\"<br /><br />It's a breath of fresh air to see that this one lesson supports common sense in the study of economics.n of wealth and economize human effort are to be dreaded; that obstructions to free production and free consumption increase wealth; that a nation grows richer by forcing other nations to take its goods for less than they cost to produce; that saving is stupid or wicked and that squandering brings prosperity.\\"   It's a breath of fresh air to see that this one lesson supports common sense in the study of economics.

B00004BZ0N|5.0|\\"London Calling\\" is one of those albums that changed all the rules for rock at the time. Filled to the brim as a double album, The Clash insisted that it be sold at a single album price. While the first two albums slipped between sloppy but angry punk and the second tried oh-so-hard to come off as a clean, big rock record, \\"London Calling\\" threw the rules and pretense out the window and let their freak flag fly. There was the blistering hard rock of the title track and \\"Clampdown,\\" the reggae of \\"Rudy Can't Fail\\" and \\"Jimmy Jazz,\\" the pop of \\"Train In Vain\\" and \\"Lover's Rock.\\"<br /><br />Above all, they decided that all their idealism was for real. The Clash directed their passion into both the music and the politics of the songs, making rabble-rousers like \\"Clampdown\\" and \\"The Guns Of Brixton\\" into fire-breathers. Their fascination with early American rock lead to a roaring cover of \\"Brand New Cadillac.\\" The album was loaded with attempts to break boundaries at every opportunity, and succeeded at almost every shot. Even some of the dopier numbers (\\"Lost In The Supermarket\\" or \\"Death or Glory\\") don't detract from the album's power.<br /><br />\\"London Calling\\" was a perfectly articulated - if raggedly punky - shout at the frustration that gave birth to the punk scene. Joe Strummer and Mick Jones wanted the whole rock packages; they wanted to be outlaws and revolutionary stars. \\"London Calling\\" was the best they ever managed at being that band.

I was a little disturbed by it too. Highly Recommended!

B0050QV0RQ|5.0|This game is an extremely well made RPG and being free for today was awesome to see.  I'm a new user to Android and the Amazon App store is awesome but I digress...  This game runs great on my Infuse 4G with no lag and the touch works great.  There's a lot here for the standard price and it seems to be pretty decent in game length.  The only issue I have is that it definitely makes my phone run hot and the battery life (which is already pretty poor) suffers quite a bit by playing.  But that's not the games fault, so I only mention it to make others aware.  Great game though!!

B004ZNARH4|5.0|Pink Floyd's The Dark Side of The Moon was released originally in March of 1973.<br />The album was the band's first number one album here in the United States of America and has stayed on the charts for nearly an accumulated 1,300 plus weeks (741 weeks from 1973-88 and many more now from 1991 - today where it still remains). Plus, The Dark Side of the Moon is the third largest selling album worldwide with some 40 million copies sold (including 15 million here in the US but should be updated for recertification now).<br />There is a good reason why this album has held up for the last nearly 40 years and it's because the songs deal with problems that one goes through in life and the production was many years ahead of its time. This was the first album that ever touched me in the heart, I used to go to sleep listening to Dark Side when I was a baby because lullabies wouldn't work half the time so when all else failed, my mother would put Dark Side on the turntable and it did the trick. Consequently, I became a die-hard Floyd fanatic, which I still am today.<br />The Dark Side of the Moon started out life as a piece called Eclipse and eventually became Dark Side of the Moon. Guitarist/singer David Gilmour's vocals and guitar solos dominate throughout the album as does keyboard player Rick Wright's keyboard work and harmony vocals.<br />This album has survived the test of time like no other album ever made before or since.<br />As everyone knows, the album was recorded at Abbey Road Studios in London between June of 1972 and January of 1973 with the band producing and Alan Parsons (whom would go on to be a succesful producer in his own right) engineering the album with Chris Thomas (whom had worked with The Beatles and became a producer in his own right working with Pete Townshend, Roxy Music and The Pretenders among others) handling the mixing.<br />All of the songs dealt with different topics that one experiences in life like \\"Time\\" (with clock noises and about racing against or managing time) and \\"Us and Them\\" (a song about the perils of war and is still relevant today). Note: the music of Us and Them was originally intended for the 1970 film Zabriske Point during the riot scenes and was called The Violent Sequence but director Antonioni rejected it in favor of another Careful With That Axe Eugene entitled Come In Number 51 but was luckily resurrected for the album's best track.<br />Instrumentals like \\"Speak to Me\\" (featuring voices that are dominant throughout the album and with a heartbeat that was done on drummer Nick Mason's bass drum which opens and closes the disc) and \\"On the Run\\" which was originally a guitar jam entitled The Travel Sequence changed into this eight note Synthi-A VCS3 synthesizer pattern complete with tape effects and guitar noises. \\"The Great Gig in the Sky\\" was originally called The Religious Sequence/Mortality Sequence before it changed into this instrumental about death and dying and featured the excellent vocal phrasings of Clare Torry. \\"Any Colour You Like\\" (which was originally called Scat during the preliminary stages of the album) is excellent as well.<br />The other tracks are classics. Aside the aforementioned Us and Them and Time, you get classics like \\"Breathe\\" (which was originally written during the recording of bass player/singer/lyricist Roger Waters' first solo project The Body with different lyrics and music save the Breathe in the Air refrain), \\"Money\\" (which eventually became Pink Floyd's first American Top 20 hit and one of the few singles released with a 7/4 time signature and was about the pleasures and negatives that money brought) and the closing one-two punch of \\"Brain Damage\\" (a song referencing to original Floyd leader Syd Barrett and absent friends) and \\"Eclipse\\" (which sums up the album) wrap up this classic of an album.<br />This album is a must in anyone's record collection and the remastering on first disc of this Experience Edition was done by James Guthrie and Joel Plante and is excellent (I don't know if this or the Hybrid SACD are best CD issues (I thought the Mobile Fidelity version was flat) but the original 1970s vinyl is hard to top)!<br />Now as part of Pink Floyd's Why Pink Floyd? reissue campaign, this classic is reissued and remastered in three different configurations. This IMMERSION Edition contains a live recording of the band performing this album at Wembley Arena (then known as Empire Pool) in November of 1974 which was originally recorded by the BBC. Turns out, the band also had a mobile truck on hand as well to record the whole show of 16 November 1974. I had the ROIO of Dark Side at Wembley 1974 for years but what Andy Jackson, David Gilmour and Damon Iddins did with this was superb. Many of the tracks are extended (On the Run (an altered sequence compared to the album), Great Gig (featuring Carlena Williams and Venetta Fields doing Clare Torry's performance as a duel (I think this version trumps the studio version)), Money and Any Colour You Like (which is five minutes longer than the album version and compare this to PULSE and it has just a four man Floyd playing with a fire and passion. I know some are griping and complaining that the \\"Echoes\\" encore is missing but I believe a live version will be on a Experience Version of Meddle in the form of its 1971 performance for the BBC (which is also on the Experience Edition).<br />Then you get two DVDs. The first is of which is the 2003 Surround Sound mix that James Guthrie did superbly for the Hybrid SACD (it's almost like hearing a new album) in two frequencies, the long defunct 1974 Quad Mix Alan Parsons did in two different frequencies. Finally, the standard mix. The second DVD consisting of the Electronic Press Kit for the 2003 Hybrid SACD, the backdrop films from the 1974/75 tours (the French, British and North American films which all differ) and live footage of \\"Careful With That Axe\\" and \\"Set the Controls\\" from The Brighton Dome in 1972 (finally great to see in excellent quality).<br />Then a Blu-Ray disc containing what was on the two aforementioned DVDs.<br />Finally, a third CD (also in its own separate wallet) consisting of the original Alan Parsons mix which does differ to the standard mix done by Chris Thomas.

Many gripe about this but life is too short to complain (at least the band saw fit to include as much as possible whereas bands like Queen, Bruce Springsteen put out so-so deluxe editions of their albums but Pink Floyd AGAIN SET THE STANDARD)!<br />The box may be expensive but (from what I hear) is limited BUT WELL WORTH IT!

B004ZNA7WY|5.0|Pink Floyd's final studio album The Division Bell was released in April of 1994 (a full two full months before I graduated High School).<br />The Division Bell was the first new studio album for the band since their 1987 comeback A Momentary Lapse of Reason. The band spent four years on the Momentary Lapse project recording and touring (the tour ended in 1990).<br />The band were inactive for all of 1991 (apart from recording the soundtrack to the auto racing film they produced La Carerra Panamericana) and spent 1992 putting together the Shine On box set. It was during an American radio interview in late 1992 that singer and guitarist David Gilmour and drummer Nick Mason revealed that the band would finally begin work on a new album in 1993. Gilmour and Mason, along with a fully reinstated keyboard player Rick Wright (whom was a sideman on the Momentary Lapse album and tour) recorded The Division Bell throughout 1993 and January of 1994 at David's own houseboat studio The Astoria in London plus Abbey Road and Britannia Row Studios with David co-producing the album with Bob Ezrin.<br />When I first put this album on after buying it on street date, it reminded me of Wish You Were Here which is my favorite Pink Floyd album. This was the band's first theme album in years with its concept about lack of communication.<br />The opening \\"Cluster One\\" is a superb instrumental and one of their best ever. \\"What Do You Want From Me\\" sounds like \\"Have a Cigar (pt. 2)\\" and is a great song and David and Rick's music just being as great as ever. The haunting \\"Poles Apart\\" starts out being about Syd and his descent into madness while the second verse (Hey You!) addresses the demise of David's relationship with Waters (which would somewhat resolve in 2005) and then ends with Gilmour's own self doubts about where he stands in the grand scheme of Pink Floyd and realizing in the end that his own personal life and love is where he keeps his sanity grounded. The Grammy winning instrumental \\"Marooned\\" is a lovely piece of music which is superb and Gilmour's guitar rising and falling like a solitary seagull. \\"A Great Day For Freedom\\" talks about the fall of The Berlin Wall and the fall of one's relationships. \\"Wearing The Inside Out\\" is Rick's personal aside about his own exile both physically from the band and mentally and featured returning sax player Dick Parry whom last played on Wish You Were Here and was Wright's first lead vocal on a Floyd track since \\"Time\\" on Dark Side 21 years earlier.<br />\\"Take it Back\\" is the closest Floyd ever came to a love song. \\"Coming Back to Life\\" is David's song to his now wife Polly Samson whom brought him back to happiness after all the traumas with Roger and the demise of his first marriage to Ginger in 1990. Polly was actually proofreader to David's lyrics on The Division Bell and out of kindness gave her credit (even if it was just for either proofreading or one phrase as he wrote the majority of lyrics on his songs alone). \\"Keep Talking\\" was the song that got loads of airplay on US FM rock radio when released and sounds like classic Floyd from Dark Side and Wish You Were Here era Floyd and still sounds great today. \\"Lost For Words\\" dealt with the demise and failed reconciliation with Waters (they somewhat reconciled in 2005). The closing atmospheric epic (which is now fittingly the final Pink Floyd song as of 2008 after the death of Rick Wright) \\"High Hopes\\" was the best Floyd track since \\"Comfortably Numb\\" which was lyrically somewhat autobiographical and was also about the things you gained and lost in life. Plus, Gilmour's classical and lap steel guitar work here is hard to put in words.<br />When the album was released (I bought the CD the day it came out and the aqua blue vinyl and cassette), it was an instant smash hitting #1 in its first week here in the States (and also in the band's native UK) and stayed put for four weeks in the Spring of 1994 whilst the band toured in support of the album and soldclose to four million copies in the US alone and many more worldwide.<br />The Division Bell is a great album and as fate turned out to be the band's final studio album in the wake of longtime manager Steve O'Rourke and keyboard player Rick Wright's passings in 2003 and 2008 respectively and Gilmour having four children with current wife Polly Samson. IMHO, The Division Bell ended the band's career with a bang!<br />In 2011, the album is re-released in a remastered CD version as part of the Why Pink Floyd? campaign done superbly by James Guthrie and Joel Plante. The album sounds as great as the limited vinyl which came out in 1994. The booklet is also excellent.<br />Hugely recommended!pies in the US alone and many more worldwide.

B005ELZKWS|2.0|I'm a total Satch fan, but this release sounded overall phoned in. The singing/screaming n' yelling just overdone and out of place too often.. maybe the next one will be better.. The first release had at least a good handful of tunes that were superstar slamming..
B005MVJM3I|5.0|I thought this album would be hard to follow-up on after the Blackening.  But they did not fail.  Love all the songs.  Pay the extra $2 to get the additional songs.
B0050CJNJ2|5.0|My favorite alll time music group known as Lady Antebellum has come out with this new awesome CD. I'm their biggest fan. To prove I'm their biggest fan, I used one of their popular songs from this CD called Own The Night for a school project. I recommend buying it for anyone who is a huge fan like me. These songs from the album are my favorites: Own The Night, Just A Kiss, and Dancing Away With My Heart.   The Own The Night Song always makes me feel like i can achieve all my hopes and dreams and always inspires me, like all of their songs do. Just A Kiss song i love too because it shows how important love is and how strong it can be and Dancin Away With My Heart because it tells of how much you can love someone. The songs on this CD have really touched me.   I love all of Lady A's songs and they truly inspire me each and every day. It would be so magical if I could meet them someday!

1451629184|4.0|Jaycee's book is incredible, scary, sad and an indepth look at what kind of sick people we have living among us. Be very prepared before you start reading this book. It will disturb some greatly. Jaycee does not hold back.  She tells her story of how she was kidnapped on her way to school by Phillip and his wife and kept for years in solitude in his backyard. She was raped repeatedly over the years and bore two children.  She is a strong woman and I applaud her to be able to tell her story. And what a story. It made me cry. It made me sad. Sometimes it would make me smile a little when as a child she was given a kitty so she was not alone and she was happy even though it was only for a short time. (Phillip wound up taking the kitty away)  What she went through during her years of captivity was horrific. For an adult to inflict pain like this on a small child I cannot imagine. She must have been so scared. So sad. So lonely.  Jaycee was kept in different buildings in the backyard throughout her life. Buildings and then a tent. She never lived in the main house with Phillip and his wife. She and her daughters were raised in the backyard.  What is scary is the county and city workers that made numerous visits to the home and never noticed the buildings or the tent in the backyard. They never fully checked the property. I feel the state let Jaycee down so shame on them!!  Jaycee does a great job on writing the book. She explains her feelings well throughout.   I hope she continues to grow as she is and continues to write.  I had a difficult time reading the book. It was disturbing. The book is well written but you have to be a strong person to be able to read it and stomach what you have read. Good luck!
1401324517|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book.  Interesting for anyone who follows tennis, and it was interesting to learn something about Rafa outside of the very stoic persona on court.  He sounds like a really decent guy and is a pleasure to watch.  Along with Roger, a terrific role model for young tennis players.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|Great game with a variety of levels and challenges. Very addictive. The only issue, that doesn't impact the game itself, is switching between apps during gameplay, which might lost the current level state.
B00536OCZA|5.0|There are a lot of versions of this record around, it's one of the greatest records in history. So you already know about the music. That's not why you're reading this unless you were born in the past decade and you're only just discovering good classical rock from it's roots. That's ok, welcome to the fold. You want to know more about this record though. It's a thick record, 180grams. This is boss. Why? Because it's harder to break! Anyone who owns records for 20+ years knows what happens to them when they are thin and brittle. These big 180gram records are where it's at! I love getting these giant thick discs. They're heavy and take up a lot of weight and space, but you're collecting records, so you don't care obviously or you'd just have an ipod. If you're looking for convenience, get something else, like a CD. If you want quality, something that will last your life time, something beautiful you can handle and listen to, this is the record style for you. I don't mind switching between records and they at least put it on one record. I have other big thick 180gram records that required two records to take all 12 tracks, so this is just a phenomenal package. It comes with some good posters and stuff too (and free MP3 download of the entire album so you can have it on your phone/mp3 player too). Great deal. I'd buy it again in a heart beat.
0062103377|5.0|I was told by a friend whose opinion I trust that I *had* to buy this book - and I'm so glad I did!  I've read all the Supernatural tie-in works and have had mixed opinions about them; they've ranged from outright horrible to good, solid fun. This one is the first tie-in that actually moved me to tears. (And yes, in a good way.)  Mr. Reed has Bobby's voice nailed - you can truly hear Jim Beaver speaking as you read. The book's premise is, something that happened during a case is causing Bobby to lose his memory, so he's writing everything down \\"just in case.\\" Some of the material we're familiar with from having seen it happen on the show, or mentioned in passing; there's also fresh, new backstory, including a couple of Bobby's early cases, told in a way that keeps the reader urgently turning pages to find out what happens next. All the important relationships in Bobby's life are explored: his late wife, Rufus, the Winchesters, and it all feels very *real*. As a bonus, the last couple of chapters are narrated by Dean, and Mr. Reed has his voice down pat as well.  The only fault I can find with the book (if you can call it a fault) is that it's short, and a very fast read. I devoured it in a couple of hours, and I wish it had gone on much longer. If you're looking for a Supernatural book that's well worth the price, it's this one. A definite two thumbs up!
B00466HN86|5.0|Saw it today.  Just like \\"Flywheel\\", \\"Facing the Giants\\", and \\"Fireproof\\", this is one of the best movies ever made.  All father's should see this movie.  Our court system should require dead beat dads see this movie as part of their court appearance.  Mr Kendrick, you are a saint!
B003ZSJ212|3.0|I'm 43. Like many my age, Star Wars holds a special place in my life memories. What has happened is you have such a successful cutting edge movie that has proved the test of time. My 10-yr old is just as fascinated with the series as I was 25+ years ago. So you have two groups, us old-school purists trying to hang on to memories of our younger years under the guise of cinematic preservation. And then you have a new generation that essentially isn't as concerned with home media production history relating to the original release. How many products on Amazon have well over 1000 1-star ratings for *any* product yet still maintains and avg 3-star rating. that says it all   My conclusion is either a) Lucas DOES really hate the cult following of his art, b) Lucas is too busy to be involved to call the shots on the blu-ray editing, iow, he doesn't care much about the bd product and is busy with other things on his life, or c) this is an ingenious marketing plan to first sell to the mainstream, piss the enthusiasts off to create buzz, then release a very low compression bd version of the unaltered originals to shut everyone up that says they want cinematic preservation when they really want to relive a better time in their life from many years ago and are change-adverse personalities at their core. It's interesting the things we all cling to as we grow older. I would say 'get a life' to many, but to each their own. Star Wars IS worthy of better retail products that offer hi-res versions of less-altered original cinematic material.
B003WJQ74E|5.0|Everything to be said about this book has already been said.  I never read this book when I was younger, and was recently reminded that I had wanted to get my hands on it.  The paperback can be had for much less than the Kindle edition, but you'll love having it on your Kindle--and synced between your devices.  Just buy it!
B005LY4B0A|4.0|I was fortunate to get this little gem for free as \\"App of the Day\\" and must say it has managed to captivate my attention for quite some time. It's a perfect mixture of easy-to-use yet complex enough to guarantee continued fun. On my little phone screen I do often cut the wrong ropes with my sizeable fingers, though.
B005E8KQPM|5.0|Anyone who's been following Opeth is used to their traditional sound scape way of just having a song that goes on forever, even though track after track went by, the music doesn't stop. That's what Heritage is like. It just starts and then when it's done, you didn't know it was another few tracks that had gone by. This album is amazing. It's so mellow, relaxed, chill, and moody. It's like sitting in a cold tavern in Alaska sipping cider and smoking a briar pipe next to a fire. It's very mood and emotion provoking. The vocals are amazing, Mikael has really progressed far as an artist. No more growling or screams folks, Opeth finally has become the ultimate form of themselves--musical with vocals being another instrument in the mid-range frequency. The entire album has a lot of interesting use of flats & sharps that you're used to hearing from them, so their signature remains. Lots of interesting harmonics going on. It just provokes relaxation. There's a lot of energy on this album, but it's that chill vibe energy, not \\"bang your head\\" energy--if you're looking for a metal album, this is not it, this is not what you're going to hear. You're going to hear something that reminds me of the sound scape endless sound of Orchid with the acoustic and vocals and mellow approach of Damnation. They're created a whole new version of themselves with Heritage. This is a definite record for anyone collecting records. This package comes with TWO records, be aware, these are 180gram thick boys. I love that. The packaging is nicely done, good art, well printed, feels good. The records are huge, thick and heavy. The tracks are across both discs on both sides. This may seem inconvenient, but it's an awesome attribute if you want records that will last your life time--these will. A must have. Get it now.
B004XNGKBS|5.0|I just downloaded this app and am enjoying playing with it.  Can anybody tell me what the little icon is to the right of the \\"X\\" in the left arrow stands for and its use?  It looks like a little candle.  I press it and it doesn't seem to do anything that I can notice.  Also, do you have to completely close out of the app to save the notes made?  Thanks!
B002I0J5FG|5.0|No need to rehash what everyone else is saying here about this great game... I haven't played Ico yet and have spent several hours on Shadow and have to say that playing this game in 3D is fantastic and adds amazing depth to the experience (similar feeling as when I watched Avatar 3D in the theater and at home on my 3D TV).  Engrossing is the best way to describe it.  Experiencing the added depth while climbing the colossi or climbing the various high towers, swimming, jumping, and even just riding the horse across the vast landscape really comes to life in an amazing way.  It takes the cinematic feel of the 2D game to a whole new and much higher level.   I originally played this game in 2D on the PS2 and loved it, and the 3D enhancement is a must see, not a gimmick by any means.  I've played COD Black Ops in 3D and that game some cool moments with the 3D effect, but did not make me feel like the depth engrossed me into the game experience as much as I'd like... definitely not the case with Shadow.  Don't know about ICO yet and how that plays or looks in 3D, but Shadow alone is definitely worth the price alone.  Playing this also has me greatly anticipating Uncharted 3 in 3D!  Can't wait...  Played on a 50\\" Panasonic TC-P50VT25 with Panasonic TY-EW3D2MMK2 glasses and the Cameron Avatar custom TV setting download... a little darker image (too dark in certain areas), but fantastic 3D effect overall.  I also set the game 3d effect bar up to 3/4 of maximum in the game setting menu.
0062112430|4.0|Very well-written, with an interesting plot and great character development. It wasn't a book that I couldn't put down, but I enjoyed it a lot. I have already pre-ordered the sequel on Amazon. I definitely recommend it.
B00516ZWRE|4.0|This is their 18th studio album over abut 30 years and holds up with that Classic heavy Metal sound. The riffs are great and vocals still got it, but songwriting is a little thin.  I love the cover and the production is great!  Def worth buying a used copy,maybe not the new price. Saxon's 70's stuff is timeless and \\"Call to Arms\\" holds up better that some of their last few cds.
B004ZNARH4|3.0|I don't really need to review the album, if you're a fan you're going to buy this anyway. Still, it seems that the music label and I don't share the same view of what should be called \\"High resolution\\", but it certainly isn't any lossy format. Still, offering the surround mixes on DVD as ac3 and calling that \\"high resolution\\" is just a slap in the face. They should have made one of those DVDs a DVD-A for those who don't have a BR-Player. As it is, the set feels pretty \\"meh\\" to me.
B005LY4B0A|5.0|This is a fun game to play when you have a minute or an hour.  Some puzzles take quite a bit of logical thinking to solve.

0385732554|3.0|If your child reads this book and is disturbed by the content, experiences nightmares or complains that the content is depressing, then I am impressed as this book did nothing for me that hadn't already been done better by Aldous Huxley in his poignant but too-often-banned novel Brave New World.  That any person believes that a book this affecting should be banned is reflective of the very problems in society that Lowry tries so hard to illuminate in this novel.  If this is what she does, then we need more of this.<br /><br />As someone who had the privilege to study Huxley's novel in-depth both in high school and college, however, this reads as nothing more than a gloss to a much greater work.  The character of Jonas may be sort-of likeable, and the author's intentions may be admirable, but I can say nothing better about this book.  She tries.  She tries so hard.  But even in the novel's most unsettling scene (spoiler) -- that of infanticide -- she fails to generate the kind of pathos inspired by even the dullest moment in Brave New World.<br /><br />I read this with my senior English class because Brave New World is frowned upon, but I wish -- Oh! How I wish! -- that we could read Huxley's Masterpiece instead.
B004ZZS4CC|5.0|Like a car wreck, it's hard to look away from this story.  I didn't want to read it.  I felt like I would be participating in the sensationalism of the story somehow -- but Jaycee has written a beautiful account of her life.  I'm glad I did read it.<br /><br />She doesn't spend any time navel-gazing, or whining about \\"why.\\"  She just writes about what happened, how, and what she did to get through it.  It's an amazing story.<br /><br />My heart broke for her as she recounts her loneliness, and her love for her pets, her only friends during her ordeal,  and the pain she felt when  they \\"disappeared.\\"<br /><br />She's a woman of courage ... she was shaped by events that NEVER should happen to anyone, anywhere, but she has survived it, and is now thriving.  I am also amazed at her recounting of her two daughters' births.  In a backyard.  I will be interested to hear their stories one day, how they will come to know and understand the truth of what their father did to their mother.  What a rough legacy to handle.<br /><br />The most fascinating part of the book is the self-delusion the Garridos functioned under.  Both of them are very very sick people.  I feel no sympathy for them at all.

B0050QV0RQ|5.0|I have been hesitant about RPGs on my droid 2 but thought I would give this one a shot! I have already put two hours into it without realizing it! Reminds me of good times as a kid! Walking around is a little wonky but other than that its a lot of fun!
B0040QYROA|5.0|This is the real deal.  Granted, the recovered footage is poorer quality than the previsouly restore parts, but it rounds out the story so well, it is possible to really see what a masterful film this is.  The subplots are restored to their importance and the film just generally has better coherence now than it ever had before.  Well worth it to have a copy.
B004DI7HZ6|3.0|This was a book club book, and is the first e-book I checked out from the library when library lending became available for Kindle.<br /><br />I did enjoy the story, and would recommend it to anyone who likes supernatural romance. I agree with another reviewer who said the tag of historical fiction is a stretch. However, I disagree with its comparison to the Twilight series. I don't think the writing is as bad as in Twilight, nor is the relationship as creepy/stalker-ish as that of Edward and Bella. There were times when I felt the author was dragging things out a bit too much, and could have used fewer descriptions, but it didn't keep me from enjoying the book.<br /><br />Without giving anything away, I will say I was a bit disappointed in the ending. I don't know if it was meant to be an ambiguous ending, or if the author has a sequel planned. I would read a sequel if that's her intent.
B002ZCY7PU|5.0|I LOVE this show!  Season three is full of suspence, twists, & laughs!  You won't be sorry you bought it!

B003Y5H5JM|4.0|First off I will say I have never seen an adaptation of \\"The Tempest\\" before so I have nothing to compare it to.  I was somewhat familiar with the Shakespeare story before watching the movie but I will say I liked the movie.  It was slow at first as I had to get used to the Shakespeare language but once I really listened to the dialogue and watched the characters, the movie flowed.  I was amazed at how many great actors and actresses are in the movie - Helen Mirren, Russell Brand, Julie Taymor.<br /><br />It is a great story of revenge and betrayal and the acting is well portrayed.  If you are going to watch this DVD though just remember it is Shakespearian dialect.  I would think big Shakespeare fans would really like this movie as it seems true to the story.  It is a movie with some neat special effects and one I could watch again.  I think my favorite character was Russell Brand and his uniqueness.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This was quite an amazing book. I'm already a quarter of the way into the second one -- that's how much I had to stay in the story. I couldn't even stop to write a review. When I began this book, I had no idea what it would be about. I had not read a synopsis, I had just been hearing how much everybody loved this series. So I began. I was confused at the beginning and couldn't get a good feel for the characters, but this only lasted a few pages. Then things got going and I was hooked.<br /><br />The story begins with Katniss Everdeen and quickly introduces her mother, younger sister, Prim and her friend and hunting partner, Gale. Katniss's father had died in a mine explosion when she was young and ever since then, she's had to provide food for her family by illegally hunting in the grounds outside of District 12 - her home. The book is set in a sort of post-apocaliptic (more post-rebellion/uprising) in the United States. But by the time the story takes place we are to understand that there are 12 Districts that exist (there was a 13th, but the reason it no longer exists is a mystery to the reader) and they are all ruled by The Capitol. Each of the Districts is kept separated, with no one allowed to leave. We are introduced to the concept of The Hunger Games very soon. Apparently, The Capitol forcibly holds these games each year in order to keep the Districts in line. To remind them of who has the power -- and who doesn't. Each District holds a lottery of sorts on the Reaping Day every year, with the results being that two teenagers (one boy and one girl) is chosen to participate in The Hunger Games as tributes. This will make 24 participants in all coming from the 12 Districts. These games will be a fight to the death in an arena of The Capitol's choosing. Katniss is one of this year's tributes, along with a boy from her district, Peeta Mellark. The story follows them (from Katniss's point of view) through their ordeal of being prepped for the games and then through the horrible few weeks of fighting, running, hiding, killing, outsmarting, watching people die, almost dying themselves and many other horrors they are faced to endure for The Capitol.<br /><br />This is an amazing story of endurance, control, perseverance, determination and love. I fell in love with Katniss and the difficulty she has in sorting out her feelings and knowing how to react and what to do -- should she act for herself, thinking of her own emotions? For The Capitol, trying to please them? For Peeta, trying to save him? The Hunger Games has everything a good story should have: deep characters, meaningful actions, adventure, trials, difficulties, romance and love. I highly recommend this book and am just taking a guess, but will probably recommend the whole series. That's all for now...I have to get back to reading.ible few weeks of fighting, running, hiding, killing, outsmarting, watching people die, almost dying themselves and many other horrors they are faced to endure for The Capitol.

B0058VW36U|5.0|[HTC Evo 3D] This game runs well on my phone, looks great. I find it really fun to play. A couple of the levels seem ridiculously easy, a couple ridiculously hard (there is still one level in the cosmic box for which I have yet to earn even 1 star), but they're all entertaining. I do wish that on some of the larger game fields it would be possible to scroll around before actually beginning to play, but then not being able to is also part of the challenge! I am excited to finally get the update for the \\"toy box\\" and I hope for many more updates ahead.
B004S5C91Q|3.0|I read the reviews before purchasing this book, so i knew that it was told from the perspective of a 5 year old. I began reading and within the first few pages realised that i would find it a little frustrating but, would still give it a go as the rave reviews heavily outweighed the bad ones.  I found that the concept was something that is familiar but rarely touched on the way the author has. An insight into the lives of a victims such as Ma and Jack. Often detail of how life would operate in such a circumstance is not imagined in detail and for that i believe the Author did a wonderful job in exploring those lives without making it too boring.  I found myself reading on, wondering where the story was going as I found similar events unfolding as we were taken through the characters day to day life.  All in all, without giving away spoilers, this book is not, in my eyes \\"a page turner\\" but i found the concept original and interesting. I think the way the Author has written would have been more difficult than most readers would consider and for that i think it's worth the read.  There were some things in the book which i found a little irrelevant and found myself questioning why the Author decided to add these facts in. For example, on several occasions, Jack explains what his penis is doing. I found this strange and insignificant to the rest of the story. It may seem to be a small fact, but, without giving anything away, i seemed to wait to see what the relevance was wondering if it had some link to the rapist captor imprisoning Jack and his Ma.  I have rated this 3 stars as i believe the book is worth the time, but with maybe it hadn't be written in the first person of a 5 year old character. In saying that, the Reader would not experience the feelings and emotions that Jack has being born into captivity and how what is \\"normal\\" and \\"safe\\" for him would be our worst nightmares.

B0046E825G|1.0|Let me start off by saying that I did not pick up any of the Twilight books until I went into a \\"vampire\\" phase a few years ago. When I read Twilight, I thought, \\"Oh, wow! This is actually different! I like it!\\" It was a different vampire story than anything I had even dreamt of reading and I really thought Twilight was amazing. My only problem? Bella. I just...I don't like her. She's annoying, and whiny, and self-centered, and I just can't handle those kinds of people. Another problem? Edward's stalking habits. Okay. Way to be creepy, Meyer. But I have to admit, I did like James attacking Bella. That was the highlight of the whole entire book.<br /><br />Now New Moon? Dear God, I can't even....Okay, so she gets a paper cut and Edward suddenly realizes he and his family are just too dangerous for Bella to be around, so he leaves. I have to say, I wanted to throw this book and not because Edward left (although, if he didn't leave, I wouldn't have wanted to throw it). Bella has a brilliant idea of riding motorcycles and doing dangerous nonsense so she can hear Edward's voice in her head. Okay. She's officially gone psycho. And Jacob goes along with it. Now let me say something about Jacob. I actually like him. He's one of the first dimensional characters in the series and I can't help but love him for that. Then Bella does something stupid (surprise, surprise) Alice shows up, they save Edward and...lo and behold, the lovers are back together! Might I add it took her over 300 hundred pages for that? Three hundred pages of nonsense (ten of which was of her puking up her guts and another five on blank passing months). Now, the whole Volturi thing, I thought was fascinating. Posh vampire's who will rip your head off at the slightest provocation. I like 'em! But, of course, Bella, Edward, and Alice were let go with a warning. Thus, New Moon is done (THANK YOU!)<br />Now Eclipse? Yeah...BORING. That's all I have to say to that. The only thing I liked was...nope, I got nothing.<br />On to the final installment of the Twilight Saga. Breaking Dawn.<br /><br />First off, what the heck? Charlie would not let Bella marry Edward without a fight due to the fact that Charlie never forgave Edward for destroying his daughter, so that technically should have involved an argument which should have led Bella to calling Renee, who would have called Charlie's fears. And then, when it happened, there was the wedding itself, which I thought was so poorly described that I can't even remember what anything was supposed to look like other than there was a lot of gossamer. And it was white. I thought Alice was going to go hog-wild and out do herself, but nope. We were DENIED descriptions, as per usual.<br /><br />Oh, the honeymoon. Okay, I'm not one for smut, COME ON!!! Give us SOMETHING to work with! Every. Single. Time they had sex, it \\"faded to black\\" and we GOT nothing other than what was left over the next morning (i.e. HEADBOARD AND PILLOWS). So that sucked majorly. And then there was the fact that Bella got pregnant. Now, if I understand correctly, the only fluids these vamps have is venom, therefore meaning, Edward has zero sperm which means Bella cannot go pregnant. It's just not possible. First sign of Meyer breaking her own rules. Well, Bella calls up Rosalie (ROSALIE?! I ask you. Rosalie HATES Bella. Come on, Meyer. At least make SOMETHING in this book believable) and they go home.<br /><br />Now Jacob's point of view, I was actually excited for. We've only got a taste of Jake's POV at the end of Eclipse (which I liked, telling Leah to jump off a cliff) and I thought it was pretty good. I hoped he was going to fall for that girl at the park, but noooo! And then, of course, he saves Bella the Moron from the pack he split from and, when Bella finally has said child (amid blood fountains and a torn stomach and intestines spilling out) Jacob imprints on the child that Meyer calls Renesmee. Say that out loud. Do it. It sounds even more stupid than when you read it. Now, I understand that you want some sentimental stuff when it comes to names, but MIXING names? Especially ones that don't even go together? Carlie I was fine with. I like Carlie, I like the spelling. But RENESMEE?! I ask you....<br /><br />Well, then there was Bella being a newborn herself which, I have to say, I was kind of looking forward to her being bloodthirsty but no. She was totally tame, which is lame. Come on. Have Bella kill off Angela or something? Heck, make her kill Lauren or Mike. It would have made her being a newborn much more believable and I would have love to see her lose herself in bloodlust and then maybe she might actually have a personality, but no. We were denied that as well. And also, this inane, clutzy human is suddenly the most graceful vampire ever. Of course. Why not? Sounds legit. (I'm still grumbling about being denied the newborn bloodlust stuff.)<br /><br />Then there's the fact that that one vampire saw Renesmee and tattled to the Volturi. This is when I thought, \\"Oooh! This is gonna be good! This is the Cullen's final straw and the Volturi are coming to kill!\\" I was excited, especially when all these cool vamps from all over the world gathered. I remember thinking, \\"This is going to be some awesome, epic fight!\\" Right? WRONG! AGAIN!<br /><br />No, what Meyer does is have all these vamps (and puppies) join forces against the Volturi and, what happens? Oh, ya know, they talk it out. \\"Now talk it out, now talk it out, now talk it out.\\" Everything is peaceful, there's no fight. Nothing. Nada. Zilch.<br /><br />Now what I would have liked to have seen was a nice, epic battle. Maybe lose some of the people the Cullens called for help, lose a few wolves, maybe a Cullen or two, and most of the Volturi. (MAKE US LOSE BELLA). But no. They all just walked away.<br />All in all, the most disappointing end to a series I have ever read. I have say, if Meyer got better editors and could figure out other words besides \\"muttered\\", \\"mumbled\\", \\"honey-colored\\", \\"topaz\\", \\"shyly\\", \\"growled\\", \\"hissed\\", \\"russet\\", and \\"realized\\", then we could potentially have a good book on our hands. On a side note: I read The Host. The plot is good, I'll give her that. Said book was poorly executed due to the fact that Mel is EXACTLY. LIKE. EFFING. BELLA. And she's caught in a love triangle. And she gets everything she wants in the end. Okay, ADD moment over. I feel Meyer has good ideas, but again, they are poorly executed due to a lack of vocabulary. LOOK A THESAURUS, WOMAN!<br /><br />I wish I could rewrite Breaking Dawn and do it my own way. Ugh. Terrible, terrible book. SUCH a total letdown. Ugh.some sentimental stuff when it comes to names, but MIXING names? Especially ones that don't even go together? Carlie I was fine with. I like Carlie, I like the spelling. But RENESMEE?!

B003O86FMW|4.0|Wow...I did the same thing at the end of this one as I did at the end of The Hunger Games...jumped directly into the next book without so much as stopping to update my status on Goodreads, let alone actually writing a review. Well, now I'm actually done with Mockingjay too, so I suppose it's review time!<br /><br />So, Suzanne Collins, you are pretty good. I think I like you. I really loved this series. I'll try to just talk about Catching Fire here though. I have to say, I did actually like The Hunger Games the most. However, both the follow-ups were really amazing and definitely worth reading. In Catching Fire, we get to see what happens after the games -- after Katniss and Peeta make history and defy the Capitol by being the first pair to win an individual Hunger Games. We see them return to District 12 and move into the Victor's Village, with only a drunk Haymitch for a neighbor. We see their relationship change because of secrets revealed and feelings hurt. We see them fake a romance on screen for a nation. We see them go on the Victor's Tour where Peeta gently comforts Katniss through sleepless nights. Just as things are starting to seem like they might be okay though, Katniss gets a visit from President Snow and she realizes things will never be okay again. As things get worse in the Districts, two announcements are made from the Capitol. The first one seems happy, but the second could mean the death of both Katniss and Peeta.<br /><br />This book really is exciting and obviously held my attention -- it's all I could focus on for 3 days until I finished it. I definitely recommend it -- just don't forget to read The Hunger Games first!!!

B003XF1XOQ|4.0|Once again, a very good read from Suzanne Collins. Mockingjay may have been slower for the first half, before picking up the pace for the exciting ending, but that didn't bother me at all. I've always felt that these stories (while they have amazing events occurring) are really character stories. We get to know Katniss from the inside and we are allowed to feel what she feels, experience what she experiences and be confused by what confuses her. We fight with her, we weep with her, we hurt with her and we love with her. These books are really one story, about a girl. We go on a journey with her and get to find out who she really is. Yes, she is a Hunger Games Victor and yes, she is the Mockingjay, but she is so much more than these things. I'm really happy with the course her relationships took during this third and final book of the Hunger Games trilogy. Everything concluded in a way that made sense, however painful the results.
0226039331|5.0|These reviews constitute such a unanimous flood of approval that it is difficult to add much original thought to what has already been said. All I can offer is that this lexicon deepens, widens, lengthens and heightens your understanding of the Koine vocabulary, so that your apprecation and perception of each word becomes three dimensional instead of one dimensional, in a manner of speaking. The definitions are honed using so many sources, both from within the Bible and outside of it, that you have a well of information for each word, especially those requiring multiple shades of definition.<br />This is an expensive volume, but a wonderful one, and it is right at the top of the food chain when it comes to Greek study aids, as far as I am concerned. BDAG has the potential to add exceptional depth and clarity to one's understanding of the Koine, and what more could one ask for?

Well Anne Frank Did. She wrote in her diary about it.<br /><br />  When the Nazi's attacked Holland, she was scared that she might die. She hid in her house trying to survive. She wanted herself , her friends, and her family to live.<br /><br />  Anne Frank put in her diary, \\"Mummy worked so hard not to be scared. She put a lot of life into the story. It was touching , like when I was reading this book, I felt bravery and courage coming from one little girl in the war.<br /><br />  I recommend this book to readers who love history and personal stories of World War II. They will be drawn to the story, because it tells you almost everything about her unique life for 2 or 3 years.

B005OT2YVA|2.0|(SORRY...THIS IS FOR BLU-RAY, NOT AMAZON INSTANT VIDEO) Would have given 4 stars for the movie/blu-ray, but I was very disappointed there were no special features at all - not even notes.  That's the main reason I like DVDs and blu-rays so much...for the special features that may contain commentary, interviews, behind the scenes and show how some of the FX were done - explosions and such.  I'm sure they will release another version in the near future with the special features movie buffs enjoy and spend more cash$  Who the hell comes out with a new release Blu-ray in this day & age with ZERO special features???  DO NOT BUY - RENT FROM RED BOX.
B005QYKE2Y|4.0|I loved loved this movie! I mean wow! But For some reason everyone say's Rosie is a terrible actress, Personally myself I loved her in this not only because she was smoking (I'm a straight girl btw) but because I just loved the personality that she brought to the screen she made it sexy and just empowered. I loved, the CGI, all the effects are beyond amazing. I like that they used flashbacks of president Kennedy that was really awesome. I would recomend this if you have the time cuddle up and watch this. When I was watching it, time flew by it truly just caught me in, A little towards the end maybe 45 mins or so I got a little distracted with other things it started to just get a little predictable, But overall This movie was amazing :) I'd def. watch it again not only for Rosie but for the amazing actors. I wish there was more Josh Dunhamel in this :( He's down right hot lol  :)
B0052UZIFA|5.0|i got this with the free app of the day deal but had i known how much fun it was, i would have bought it anyway. the game really is amazing, i even played it all the way through again after it lost my save data. which brings me to my second point, popcap has virtually no customer support that i could find and if you get this game, make sure you quit the game through the menu so that your saved game doesnt get corrupted (im assuming thats what happened to mine). all in all, amazing game though, funny, good graphics & sound, entertaining story line, my girlfriend hates how much i play it.
0743277708|1.0|Can you imagine having the power to tell the future, good or bad? What would it be like to know that someone is trying to capture and kill your community?  Can you picture moving from place to place? Well, that's what happens in the fantasy  book Watership Down by Richard Adams. If you love rabbits, fantasy, and  wonderful characters this book will be  great b for you.<br /><br />Fiver is psychic and  he can see the future. He saw a vision of humans destroying the rabbits warren, so the rabbits flee. Hazal is the small leader of the rabbits, he helps them  astoblish a new home called Watership  Down. The male rabbits realize they need does from another warren to mate with. They try to steal the does, and they are successful. Eventually, after a long journey the rabbits settle  down in their new warren.<br /><br />When I was reading this book I kept thinking, '' Is this book ever going to be over ?'' I got so bored of reading five hundred pages about bunnies that have to find does to mate with. however I like how each chapter started with a poem. I thought the author did a great job dragging the story on and on and on... When I finished the book it was a great accomplishment, because I wanted to STOP reading after two pages into the book.<br /><br />I would  recommend this book to people unlike me, people who like fantasies that go on and on and on... I think this book is for  older people, or an audience who doesn't get bored by five hundred pages about rabbits that go on a very, very  long journey. And I think  there are people who will like this book.<br /><br />By the Best

0553801473|3.0|Finished \\"A Dance with Dragons\\" last night, some quick thoughts... we waited 5 years for that? I liked it, but I was disappointed. I found myself having the same thoughts that my son has about Tolkien, too verbose over the mundane. Martin must be a closet (or not so closet) Food Network junkie with all the time he spends describing anything edible. He's also become a bit formulaic; why do most chapters have to end with some \\"twist\\" or not so surprise? Some plot developments I didn't care for but it's his story, so that isn't really a legitimate complaint. Book 3 remains my favorite.
B002BU0DPE|4.0|These are awesome! I have been using them for about 2 months and I love them. their quality is great. These will satisfy any gamer unless they are doing this for a living, and the reason I say this is because after a while of wearing them they get a bit annoying because they sit on your ears not around them. If you have really small ears this wont be a problem anyway. But unless you are playing for more than 6 hours or something abnormal you will be fine. Once you put those on you wont remember that your are in your living room. I cant even hear me 3 yr old brother running around the house because these are so great. Not a question of whether to buy them but the question is when.

B0057GYO9K|1.0|The original CD release sounds A LOT better than the remastered version (more dynamic) .   The remastered CD is over-compressed to the point where there's clipping all over the place.   Dave Grohl's drums sound flat and lifeless now. It's a shame that such a legendary album   gets such a terrible treatment.   Google \\"Loudness War\\" to find out more about the technical details.
B003YL4LYI|2.0|After waiting so long for this book, I was bored to death.  I kept waiting and hoping the story would pick up. In A Feast For Crows it got interesting towards the middle of the book but this book never got interesting.  I had to force myself to read it hoping it would get better.  When the next book in the series comes out, I'll wait for the reviews before I buy it.
B005MVIF7M|5.0|Wilco has been in my heart since 2006. Nothing compares.   I saw them live the day this album was released, and i fell back in love with them.  There's something about the combination of Jeff's voice, his lyrics, the steel guitar, piano, and the random little noise they carefully throw in, that makes it bittersweet.  When listening to them you get that feeling, after you've had a long good cry and you can't cry anymore. It's almost euphoric.  To anybody who is addicted to beautifully crafted, sad music, give this album a try.

0307948560|4.0|Caution - review may contain a few small spoilers...  What I loved about the book was the humor that Ms. Pearson found in everyday situations. She really has a knack for observing even the smallest of things that the average person overlooks and putting a comical spin on it.   I could not believe how many things I could relate to in this book, and in a way, it's helped me with my own daily struggles of being a working mom of 3. Instead of getting overly frustrated by something, I try to find the humor in it. I might even put a 'Kate spin' on it in my head and laugh to myself a little.   What I didn't love about the book was the last few chapters. I thought the revenge thing got a little off-subject and I guess the cynic in me sneered at the fact that she essentially parades off into the sunset, so-to-speak.  I mean, I'm glad for even a fictional character who finds happiness, but I just felt it flipped so quickly, I guess.   Overall, I would recommend this book to any Mom - working, stay-at-home, whatever. Because the little anecdotes about daily motherhood life will crack you up.

B005C5A6C0|5.0|When a band or musician has a phenomenal breakthrough album, it's usually among the earlier releases and following up for example after a stunning debut is one tough chore especially in the picky environment of today's music market where there is almost no tolerance for change, but yet the artist gets raked over the coals if the new album sounds like the first.  Sometimes you can't win.<br />  But Machine Head may have had a little wind at their back that fans didn't realize when creating \\"Unto The Locust\\", the follow-up to the legendary \\"The Blackening\\".  It is their seventh studio album which gives them a long time to have honed their craft and attack.  Fans forgot that \\"The Blackening\\" was a natural progression from its fine predecessor, \\"Through The Ashes Of Empires\\".  This new CD actually recalls some of the more refined moments of \\"Ashes\\" while retaining the epic feel of \\"The Blackening\\".  Most tunes are faster, thrash much harder and even kids singing in the background doesn't disrupt the festivities, nor does the a capello opening of the CD.<br />  So here is the answer everybody wants to know:  is it as good as \\"The Blackening\\"?  I've only had it for a short time, but my initial opinion is yes.  It's a little more streamlined, and not quite as long.  \\"Unto The Locust\\" is probably the most brutal album in the Machine Head cataloge, even more so than \\"The Burning\\".  And make no mistake:  Rory Flynn and Phil Demmell are a ferocious guitar tag team.  When all else fails, rock your balls off, and MH know how to do that, and are only too happy to remind us.  They praise Metallica a lot, but after this CD settles in, there will be no more ass kissing for this band.  They are a force to be reckoned with, and I wouldn't take the same stage for all the weed in Colombia.  Truly, it's lame ass bands like Metallica who should be sucking up, and they will soon enough.
B005FLX2WC|5.0|I never (and I mean never), take the time to write a review for any Cd's I buy, and I have bought a bunch (over 700, had over 500 records at one time, and a couple hundred cassettes). I couldn't play a musical instrument to save my life, but I have listened to a lot of music in my 50 years on this planet. With all that said, I understand that my opinion probably doesn't mean all that much. But I did want to say that I love this recording. Been listening to it non-stop for five days now. If you like blues rock and/or soul R & B, you will probably like this. Hate to use the word wonderful...but that is what this release is. Wonderful, full of life, and just plain good, from start to finish. I just hope Joe B. and Beth get together again. Because her vocals, and his guitar work are a real \\"match made in heaven,\\" as they say, and us poor working folks haven't got a whole lot to look forward to these days. I bought this Cd on Monday, and today is Friday...it has been a good week. Might give yourself a lift, and check this one out.

0385534639|2.0|THE NIGHT CIRCUS has an interesting if someone derivative plot at its core.  Two illusionists train their  apprentices to compete against each other in a show of their gifts.  A magical circus open only at night that mysteriously moves throughout the world becomes the venue for these two young magicians to show their stuff.  But wait one of the competitors is a young man, Marco, the other a young woman, Celia, and the test is one of endurance as the winner is simply the one that stays alive the longest.  And to further complicate things rather predictably the two competitors fall madly in love.  As cliched as this plot might seem if the author was able to make the characters and setting come alive THE NIGHT CIRCUS could be an excellent romantic fantasy.  Unfortunately the author never really makes her readers care about Marco or Celia who remain relatively flat throughout the story as do the very large and confusing cast of  often strange characters.  The author does give painstaking details about the magical and mundane aspects of the circus which is literally rendered in shades of black and white but instead of drawing me in to the story with all this visual imagery I was simply bored.  Part of the problem may be the frustrating way in which the author switches time and place settings in a non linear manner.  True, each chapter begins with the date (somewhere from the late 19th century to early 20th century) and place but I at least had to turn back often to see where the current storyline fit in the chronology of the novel. There are also some descriptive second person accounts inserted in to the novel which added nothing but confusion to the book's style.  I know this book has ardent fans and has all ready been opted for the movies but I personally can not see what all the excitement is about.
B0000042MY|4.0|The Last of the Mohicans is one of those rare movies that stays with you after you've seen it. I've been a fan since it was released almost 20 years ago. A movie filled with action, romance and a lot of heart. It is a rewarding and very sad movie. The actors, director and the scenery are all top notch and the music takes it to another level.  The soundtrack is one of the few that I remember scenes and dialogue just by hearing it. Unfortunately a complete score was not released so there are a lot of tracks missing. One of my favorites is the incredibly sad music that plays over the end credits. This music is beautiful and somber and you relive all of the heartbreaking moments that occur during the movie's final 10 minutes. Another flaw is that the \\"Promentory\\" track is not the complete 8 minute version that plays in the movie.  Hopefully we'll be treated to an expanded score ala Superman or Alien.

B003Y74AXO|3.0|I have always been ambivalent about screen protectors but have used them in the past when the screen I was protecting was prone to damage with normal use (my old Palm Pilot for example).  Even though so far the screen on our family's two iPads have not suffered any damage, their sheer expense made me want to protect them - so I gave this a try.  It was OK but a couple issues make me less than enthusiastic about it.  PROS:  The instructions are simple and clear.  The provided cloth for cleaning the screen doesn't do nearly as good a job cleaning the screen as the one Apple provides with the iPad - in particular it could not get the oil from fingers off.  The provided \\"squeegee\\" (its a plastic card, like a credit card) did an OK job of getting the bubbles out (with exceptions I discuss below) as long as you held it at an angle of around 30 degrees and moved the bubble slowly.  The iPad works just as well with it on as without it, and I detect no additional difficulty seeing whats on the screen - as one would hope.   CONS:  I cleaned the screen really well, but after applying the protector when I tried to remove any remaining bubbles I found that there were about a half dozen 1/8-inch bubbles that would not go away because there was a tiny speck of dust in each one.  Also, in a couple places where I held the protector near the edge it would not adhere to the iPad.  Functionally its not a problem but between the bubbles and the places around the edge that did not adhere it just looks messy.  Maybe I am just looking more closely but the protector seems to collect more oil from my fingers.  It cleans up fine.  In the end I find that the appearance as applied bothers me more than the prospect of screen damage.  At some point I will remove this one and not replace it.
B000002J1O|5.0|I'm sure other reviews have covered the gist of what makes this album so incredible. I'll just say that it's my favorite and I honestly think that it's genesis' best album they've ever made. One of the best progressive albums ever made as well. Pretty heavy words but with this album it's easy to say lol. Buy it!
B003ZSJ212|3.0|ost of the other reviews have complained about the modifications to the film, so I'll talk about something else: the layout of the menu options. The way it's organized is really cumbersome. The bonus features are organized by movie, then by planet, then by type of feature. Given that the only reason many people bought this set was to see the deleted scenes, it just means having to go through many layers to get to the deleted scenes, then you have to backtrack to see the deleted scenes for EACH planet. I can't imagine who thought organizing the features by planet was a good idea. To make things worse, there's no \\"play all\\" option for the deleted scenes. Again, a simple, standard option that makes life easier.  Most of the new deleted scenes themselves aren't particularly exciting and it's clear why they were cut. Amongst the prequels, the only one I enjoyed was the ROTS Elevator Antics because it really shows the bond between Obi-Wan and Anakin. I also liked the Anakin-Palpatine relationship in Amending the Constitution. The really gems are the original trilogy deleted scenes. It was truly magical seeing scenes we've heard about for three decades but never seen. . I personally think the Anchorhead scene should have stayed in the movie because it's great characterization for Luke. It's even great seeing rough cuts of the Cantina. The ESB scenes weren't quite as dramatic, although I did like seeing the extra footage of the pre-1997 Wampas. But it's clear those scenes would have detracted from the film. ROTJ also has some neat scenes, such as the one of Luke building the lightsaber - another one that could easily have made it to the final cut. The expanded scenes with Moff Jerjerrod really build up his character and make him a much more sympathetic. I really do wish they'd kept that in.   I want to be clear: these movies look gorgeous on blu-ray. However, they didn't look bad on DVD. The main selling feature of this blu-ray was the bonus features and I just think they could have - and should have - had an easier layout. Hopefully future releases will streamline the menu options. I hate to give Star Wars just 3 stars, but I really think this release could have and should have been better.
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|This book is not going to be for everyone.  * If you don't feel like cracking a smile if The Star League is trying to recruit you to defend the Frontier against Xur and the Kodan Armada;  * If the fact you watched an excessive amount of 80's after school cartoons/TV shows should bring a not so small amount of shame;  * If you never played those single player, texted based adventure games on an old computer like an Apple ][;  * If you have no idea where the words \\"Ready Player One\\" even appears on;  * If you have no idea what a 300 baud modem sounds like when connecting to a BBS (NOT the Internet!)  If any of the above applies to you, you may not really appreciate Ready Player One. :-)   I lost count the number of times I cracked a smile when an obscure 80's reference was made or when I realized \\"Hey!  I watched that!\\" or said to myself \\"Yes, I remember playing that\\".   Except for a couple of blatant and serious mistakes by Mr. Cline, I am going to say: \\"Thanks\\" for bringing back the 80's to my life.   Small mistakes really: It's called Macross NOT Robotech and it's called Space Battleship Yamato NOT Star Blazers (thank you Harmony Gold, and others, for messing up cartoons left and right!)

B004EPZ07U|1.0|If you've even touched a Green Lantern comic and then watched this abomination you will know how awful it is.  One of the biggest gripes about the movie was using far too much CGI.  Yes, we all understand CGI was needed for the ring's powers and stuff, but this movie had way way way way too much to the point that I felt like I was watching an animated movie at parts (like when Hal travels to Oa).  The Oa scene was essentially 100% CGI except for Hal's face.  When he's flying with Tomar-Re and you see him from a front view as if he's flying towards you it just looks awkward as heck.  Another gripe was they barely introduced the corps at all.  We see Kilowog for a bit (who actually showed up much later in the comics AFTER Hal's first appearance) and Sinestro for a bit more, but that's really about it.  The introduction of the corps lasts like 10 minutes of the movie.  They also killed off Lanterns who place large parts in the current comics such as Iolande and Isamot (more Lanterns who joined the corps even longer after Hal's introduction in the comics).  The Yellow Ring was a joke as well.  It didn't even explain how Sinestro obtained it (from the weaponers on Qward).  It was basically like he just pulled it out of his pocket and said \\"Hey the bad guy is yellow, and this ring is yellow, maybe it will work?\\"  Sinestro also had no reason whatsoever to take the Yellow ring to use during the credits.  I mean a single noob green lantern just defeated Parralax and Sinestro wants more power when what he has already makes him what he should believe one of the most powerful people in the Universe?  He had no reason to want the ring.  He hadn't even been kicked from the corps yet.  Also, Ryan Reynolds did an awful job as Hal.  He joked WAY too much.  Hal cracks the occasional joke but he's not a jokester.  Blake Lively didn't fit Carol Ferris at all, looks and acting.  Peter Sarsgaard did a decent job as Hector Hammond but his head wasn't big enough.  Why Parralax was even inthis movie is beyond me.  Overall I give this like a 1/10.  One of the worst comic book movies ever made.  Its just as bad as X-men 3 and Spider-man 3.  I'm a major DC fan, and don't pay much attention to Marvel but I must say that the Marvel movies this year were infinitely better than this trash.  I hope there is no sequel and if they do a remake that they use different actors, a better and more true storyline, and less CGI.
B000021Y77|5.0|I usually HATE the lightning-fast, quick-cut edits in modern movies. It always reminds me of either TV commercials or mindless music videos. RUN LOLA RUN uses this technique in a way that I never thought possible, by giving us a story w/ heart and soul at blazing speed! LOLA (Franka Potente from ANATOMY and CREEP) is a warm, emotional woman w/ a fast mind. LOLA's boyfriend is in dire trouble, having lost his gangster boss' money. Now, LOLA finds herself in a frantic race against time, attempting to accomplish the impossible in 20mins! If movies have to be at light-speed, then they should be like this! Flawless and ingenious...
1609611543|5.0|I wasn't lucky enough to have a curious, clever, caring doctor like Dr Davis. My massive intolerance to wheat, you would think obvious from my extreme symptoms, went unrecognised and untreated for fifty years. By that time I had been following medically-prescribed, low-calorie, low- fat diets for most of my life. These were all based on wheat products - wholegrain bread and pasta - and completely and efficiently destroyed my health and my life. I became massively overweight, having been slender and attractive in my youth, and despite starving myself for protracted periods.  I could not walk upright because of ataxia. I could barely breathe because of asthma. I could barely see. I couldn't focus my mind, despite previously having been a sharp-witted live broadcaster. I began to feel as if I were being possessed. I cried all day, for no reason. I suspected everyone of intending me harm, and wouldn't go out.  I developed nerve damage, and often could not feel my legs or hands. My bloated stomach was so large that once, when I attended a POST-natal appointment, the nurses were asking me when my baby was due! I was so weak that I couldn't hold my newborn baby. In fact I couldn't hold my arms up long enough to wash my hair, and became dependent on carers. I developed tinnitus so loud that it could drown out the noise of overhead aircraft at an airport (and which, sadly, is still with me).  I underwent many painful and pointless investigations, to try to find out what was wrong with me. My surgeons were as ignorant as my GPs. One took my appendix out, because he couldn't think what else to do. During one particularly horrific hospital stay, I remember a young doctor's standing at the foot of my bed, begging me to think what could be wrong with me, because it looked as if I might die. I was suffering from a massive peritonitis-like infection, an infection so bad that they simply sewed me up and said there was nothing more they could do. They didn't dare operate for fear ofspreading it about. Imagine how frightening that was, and how heartbroken it made my desperate husband. Nothing made any difference. I was sent home to my fate. I would like to add here that on each occasion I visited either a doctor or hospital, it was either subtly or overtly expressed that I was fat, so therefore had been the architect of my own misfortune. By this time my husband was having to make all my meals, so he knew exactly how little I had been eating, and how \\"healthy\\" was my food. It made no difference. The doctors took even less interest in me than before, because they assumed I spent all my days sitting on a sofa eating candy.  Like I say - they were no Dr. Davis!  Because we had no other choice, we turned to the internet to try and save my life. We Googled all my symptoms, and quickly began to suspect that this was something to do with autoimmunity. Within about an hour we had found celiac disease, and knew this was it. We spent a week researching, before approaching a doctor. We knew we would need real proof in order to be taken seriously. I went armed with papers from The Lancet, and The New England Journal of Medicine, and research from John Hopkins University. I was determined not to insult their intelligence, even though doctors had done that to me for the whole of my life. At that point I had a blood test, which was positive, followed by a biopsy - again positive. I had found my own disease, and I had saved my own life. The results, from a leading specialist, were met with sarcasm and disbelief. Even in the face of expert medical proof, my doctors could not accept that mere bread had been killing me. That is the crux of the problem today. Doctors have gotten into the way of dispensing pointless drugs, rather than their time and powers of deduction. I commend Dr Davis for wanting to reverse this trend.  For the avoidance of all doubt, here it is. Eating wheat almost killed me. It cost me my appendix, an ovary and one kidney. It cost me my childhood to illness, and more than one lucrative  job. I am, thankfully, and only just, living proof that wheat is a devastating poison. The food pyramid is on its head, and Dr Davis is being vilified for pointing this out. I love this book. I admire his courage in spreading the message. He is not alone. He finds himself facing up to the baying, illogical, unscientific wheat growers and food processing companies and wrong-headed doctors as did Robert Atkins in the past, and as does Gary Taubes now. There is a lot of money in wheat, so it's going to be quite a fight to be rid of it. These men come at the subject from slightly different angles, but agree about processed carbs, and the dangers of eating grains. The science backs them up.  You have to ignore a great deal of science to conclude that wheat is safe to eat. Look how ill and fat people are becoming. How cynical for governments to be hounding the obese, whilst insisting they eat the cereal poisons which made them fat in the first place. To governments everywhere I ask why do you prefer to break your bank to meet the cost of drugs and healthcare for chronic illnesses, than to revise your outdated views on diet? If you aren't motivated by compassion, which I am sure you would wish to be, then be motivated by the prospect of financial savings, because I suspect, as do many people more knowledgable and well-informed than I, that your savings could be in their billions. Save money. Heed the low carb movement. Heed Dr Davis.   We were all warned about tobacco products when it was realised smoking was dangerous. The government didn't order us to smoke MORE, whilst it investigated. But that's what's happening with wheat. If you read this book, and take on board the message, you will improve your health more than you could ever imagine. I have been left disabled by my intolerance of wheat - my system broke under the stress of so much poison, but even so, the transformation in my health has been miraculous. My neighbour described my recovery, a week after ditching wheat, like my being given anti venom for a snake bite! Don't let yourself become permanently handicapped by your love of toast and sandwiches. They are not worth it - not worth developing paralysis for,  as did I, or heart disease or cancer, as do other unfortunate people. I have lost fifty pounds this year, simply by eating gluten and wheat  free FRESH food. Eat this way and, as Dr Davis counsels, you can be slender (and healthy) without ever going hungry. Say goodbye to your wheat belly. Forever.
B0058VW36U|5.0|This is a great app - fun to play, great graphics, very smooth gameplay and easy to learn. I'd not say it is hard but some levels can be fairly challenging. I was really excited to see this as a FAIRS but I wouldn't have minded paying the buck for it either. great game!
B004FPE4DK|5.0|This guy is a real talent. The songs are evocative and have an earthy, \\"down-home\\",  quality not often heard. If you like Bon Iver, Iron and Wine, Elliot Smith...anyone like that - then run, don't walk, to get this album. \\"If I had a Boat\\" is just achingly beautiful.
014241543X|5.0|Great book. I am really glad I read it and I recommend it to anyone. Will really remember this one for awhile.
B004GJDQT8|5.0|What a time saver when shopping for something. The scanner works great for comparing prices and looking up products. Of course one cannot expect functionality of the full fledged Amazon website, yet this app provides you with great convenience on the go.
B000ETQR3Q|5.0|Just got this gun!  Have been trying to win a used one, but was tired of being out bid at the last second so I invested my money in a brand new one!  Just opening the gun gave me joy!  I own several Nerf guns now, this one is one of my favorites!  Not sure I will use it since it was expensive, but just being able to look at it or hold it will be good enough for me!  It will sit next to my Longstrike (White Out Series) on the shelf!  I wish Nerf would make the mission kits again!  I got into Nerf just this year so I missed out on all the good mission kits!  Wish I had the pinpoint sight!  Too bad people are trying to make a buck by selling them at high prices!  I wish they would realize that other people would love to own one, but do not have the money to dish out especially with today's economy!  I am not sure I will get into modifying my guns, but I have already painted one red dot sight white to match my Longstrike.  It turned out pretty nice.  This gun cost me too much to try and paint and if I messed up, it would be a costly mistake so like I said before, I will treasure this Nerf gun!  I love collecting Nerf now!  I was also surprised at how fast I received this item!  Thanks to this company for not over pricing too much over the original list price and shipping it fast!  I got it in just two days after ordering!  If you have the money, I would recommend buying it now!  I have a feeling the price is only going to get more expensive especially now since it is getting close to the holidays!  It really is a nice looking gun!  Well worth it!
B0009A21R6|5.0|The 5.1 mix is tasteful, clear, and balanced...bringing this album to its ultimate fruition. If you like this album, and have an SACD player + quality equipment, you won't be disappointed in the least.<br /><br />Incidentally, Walk Of Life is probably my least favorite tune on the album - and IMO probably the worst sounding as well, suffering from too much high-mid-range. Skip ahead to the beautiful trumpet intro and solo sax of \\"Your Latest Trick\\". \\"Brothers In Arms\\" is just plain goose-bump gorgeous (as always) and more immersive and evocative than ever on 5.1 SACD. Worth the price of admission. Enjoy!
B0050QV0RQ|5.0|Much more enjoyable than I anticipated; I'm glad that I gave this game a chance. I will certainly be looking at other games that this developer comes out with.
B003K1EYM6|1.0|It didn't work with my SDHC card.  But if I held it just right it did work directly from the camera with the sd card installed, but as soon as I moved, it lost the connection.  very frustrating.  apple support was useless, the rep read me the support file I'd already been through a dozen times.  don't bother buying the camera connection.
B0034G4OVS|5.0|are people crazy for giving this bad reviews. i bought the blu-ray and i watched it. this movie is so terrific i can not even explain how good it was. this is full of action and suspense.its as fun as being on a rollercoaster. i expected it to be good but not this good. i recommend this to everyone. what a great movie.
B004J4WKTW|3.0|I was very excited to buy this book, after descriptions like, 'magical', and 'breathtaking' was used to describe it. Kinda disappointed. It felt like a long read & wasn't as good as I was expecting.
B0050QV0RQ|4.0|I love that you can just touch where you want to go and don't need an on screen joy stick.  Dialog is iffy though. Overall this game is great.
B0050QV0RQ|5.0|Got this during the free download but if I knew how much fun this was before, I would have bought it. The 3bucks that are asked for are well with it. I've been playing for hours and its still getting me to come back for more. Running this on the Nexus S.  This game is very Final Fantasy-like when it comes to game play. The story is much like it too. If you're a fan of old RPGs this is well worth it.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|Love it. Works well and the predict text actually learns what you say most. I recommend this to everyone. Banana
B005DKLPF6|4.0|Matodon can do no wrong for me, they are one of the most exciting bands currently making music. 'The Hunter' is somewhat of a departure from previous works, as there is no large thematic overarch to the lyrics, and the songs are shorter and more concise. Which is a smart move in my opinion, because what could they do after 'Crack the Skye' other than strip things down! But make no mistakes, this is still a Mastodon album, it rocks, the musicianship is brilliant, the songs although shorter still feel 'epic' when needed, and brutal and heavy otherwise. The mix, as a few reviewers have noted, is fantastic, kudos to Mike Elizondo (hope I spelled his name right?). Say what you will about hip-hop, some of those producers know how to make records SOUND great, and I bet this guy becomes a more sought after producer in the rock world. So, all in all, another great Mastodon album, and you should pick it up ASAP...
B0050QV0RQ|5.0|Two awesome and amazing android games for free from Amazon two days in a row? This game, Symphony of Eternity, and Cut the Rope. Amazon rocks
B004K7HMJ6|4.0|Great CD that includes two songs from her SNL appearance.  Thought it would be more jazzy/blues like Mamma Knows Best but still shows Jessie's great range and abiility as a singer.
B0050QV0RQ|3.0|You really have to wade through a lot of crap before you find a decent, playable rpg for free. This game is actually pretty addictive. I agree with most of the praise that's been posted so far. My only beef is that I can't seem to equip any items. HTC Inspire 4G
0385344325|5.0|I read it cover to cover in one evening, I throughly enjoyed this book! This is the first Jack Reacher book that deals with his past. We've had little peaks entwinned in each of the other stories and now we learn what started him on his wandering path. I hope the author will take us back even earlier into Reacher's life and show us how Jack became the man he is today.
6305558167|5.0|I think this is one of the most well written and produced movies of all time. Of course, this is my opinion, but, if you've ever wondered about ancient civilizations and the origins of our culture you need this movie in your collection.

1932907009|4.0|Here's the deal. We all love to call movie making and script writing an \\"art.\\" And it is an art, but it is so very different than all the other major arts. A painter sits by himself and paints. A songwriter strums his guitar and creates a song. A novelist spends months crafting a novel by himself. With all these art forms the final product is one person's creation with some or little production added. The painting gets a nice frame. The song gets some strings behind it. The novel gets a good cover. Also with these art forms the investment of money by others needed to produce it and bring it to market is miniscule, compared to making a movie.<br /><br />A script writer is a cog in the wheel of the movie making process -- an important cog, but a cog nevertheless. For a movie to be made nowadays MILLIONS of dollars have to be raked from investor's wallets and dozens and hundreds of actors and crew need to be hired. If you've ever invested in anything you know that you want to be somewhat sure of your return on investment.<br /><br />To me movie making is closer to constructing a building then creating more traditional art (per above.). The building's investors want to see a blueprint that they think is somewhat, to some degree, proven to work before they put down their money and break ground.<br /><br />\\"Save The Cat\\" lays out a blueprint (formula) for script writing that has proven to work time and again. Snyder does an excellent job of identifying and codifying the key elements that make up a great script. And for those reviewers who criticize Snyder's own scripts as a reason his formula isn't good, well, in my opinion that's a bit of a cheap shot. Snyder uses many examples of block buster movies that follow his formula... not just his scripts.<br /><br />Snyder's techniques aren't the only techniques, but they are very clear and concise and offer a very workable blueprint to follow.<br /><br />However, if you're serious about screen writing you will want to read other books. Just as there are many ways to save a cat, there's many ways to skin a cat. Snyder's book isn't the only one you should have in your library, and I believe he would be the first one to tell you that.<br /><br />My main issue with the book is that Snyder does lay it all out like it is Gospel, especially when he gets into structure where he lays out what MUST happen on specific pages. The novice screenwriter shouldn't get so hung up on this. This is where he should look to other books and read screenplays to see how they do it.er books.

B004U2S3OE|5.0|There are so many dead throughout this book that I'm sure the crows all over Westeros and beyond had quite a feast. Now I guess death is just part of the bargain when you are trying to hold a kingdom or trying to get a hold of one. This book like the others is also full of suspense, fighting and adventure.<br /><br />Now that I reread the first 3 books of the series, this book makes more sense now. The first time I read it 5 years ago I didn't remember many details of the first 3 so I was kind of lost. On this one, I do love Jaime Lannister even more. He's turning out to be a great man. His sister, Queen Cersei is totally the opposite. She was mean to begin with, but now she's turning out to be the Queen of Evil. However the tables start turning for her. Let's see what Lannisters are made of.<br /><br />Arya Stark is becoming of age the hard way, but she lives to the fullest. Sansa Stark gets a new identity, and Brienne is out on the look her. Slowly but surely we start to glimpse other sides of the plot, like what goes on in Dorne, where princess Myrcella was shipped by the Imp, and the politics that are at stake. Samwell Tarly gets to see the world on his trip to Oldtown, and learns quite a few interesting things from Maester Aemon. I'm finally ready to start reading A Dance with Dragons, can't wait to start.
B004ZNARH4|5.0|I was sitting on the fence for awhile on this one. Over $100 for another Pink Floyd Box-Set? But all I had to do is put the Blu-Ray disc in, select \\"original stereo mix\\" (1973) and plug in the head phones. There I was, transported back in time, with an uncompressed version of the best album ever made. I was considering not purchasing, with what all the negative reviews on packaging and marbles and scarfs, but I'm sorry people, this box set is about sound and art, not trinkets and coasters. They are kind of fun to have, but it's the music that counts and this one does not disappoint. I'm sure there will be more versions to come, but to me this is about as good as you're going to get when it comes to the true sound and feeling of Pink Floyd's \\"The Dark Side of the Moon\\".
B0051BVQFG|2.0|This movie had potential but the depth wasn't there.  The action was good though, and some decent character development going on with those jarheads.  But needless to say all this was was a shoot em up bang bang movie.  No storyline, no overarching plot besides running around shooting.  I thought this could be a sneaky movie that would grab my attention and I would come away saying wow that one surprised me.  But unfortunately that did not happen...think the creators of this were shooting to create a District 9 cult type film, and well they fell flat on their face with this one.  If you want a decent and recent sci-fi flick that is worth it detour to District 9 its much better and the story is much more grasping.
B0036S4CTS|5.0|I really liked this book. I would definitely recommend it to my friends. I wanted to read the book before I saw the movie. This love story has so many ups and downs, I couldn't stop reading it.
B004WKOCP8|2.0|Yes, SCIENCE and Make Yourself are two of my favorite albums of all time.  I have accepted that the band that created those two has been gone for a while so I tried to go into this with an open mind.  I liked the song Adolescents quite a bit so I picked it up without hearing anything else.  Unfortunately Adolescents is by far and away the best song on this release.  This release is...just boring.  Of course it is not the hard edged rock/rap Incubus of years past, but this is more of a nightclub lounge act.  Some of the songs would be good \\"change of pace\\" songs (Promises, Promises; Thieves), but instead it is just slow song followed by slower song.  This release is pretty much void of energy and emotion.  I give it one star for Adolescents and one star for Brandon Boyd unique voice.
1401219268|5.0|The theme of this book varies greatly, but Moore does a fantastic job of pulling all of the story together at the end. Jon was a normal man created into a superhero from a science experiment gone wrong, and there are several really interesting elements throughout this book. It is a mystery of some sort that is eventually solved. Moore does a great job in not giving away the ending and keeping things interesting with his pictures, and even his figurative language. I would say that Moore needed to improve something, but he really doesn't.
1441866868|2.0|My wife and I made it through about 4 hours of the story, but we just could not push forward. My wife and I both enjoy science fiction/fantasy, but we found this story very dry and boring. The story didn't seem to be going anywhere. The voice work was good.
B004ZNAGNE|4.0|The remaster is not too bad, I guess. The studio version is a much better sonic presentation than the standard-disc version of the '92 Parsons remaster, but compared to the MoFi disc this one is still not quite as preferable - I own all of these and have made the comparisons on a very good HiFi. I've not personally heard the (generally well-received) SACD. The soundstaging and overall openness are unquestionably there, but there is a slight forwardness, or just a bit of hardness, in the upper mids and into the highs on the new remaster that otherwise is in fact excellent sounding. It's just that it lacks something of the overall distinct 'm-e-l-l-o-wness' that characterizes the MoFi disc which gives that edition a more relaxed sound and, with it, the ability to see just that much deeper into the mix - and I'd like to point out that is pretty much exactly the kind of presentation you might want, especially on an album as sonically and artistically immersive as this one. But, this remaster could be good enough I suppose to end a lot of hair pulling and gnashing of teeth for those who've long been looking for simply a respectably good copy of the original mix. The MoFi disc (still the king in my book, so far) is one of the most quietly recorded discs I own. This new one is recorded at a more conventional volume level while also, it seems, thankfully side stepping the \\"loudness war\\" issue. Of course, this set comes with a live version (which sounds pretty dang good BTW) and that alone makes it pretty sweet. But, all said and done, I'm inclined to give this edition at least a 3 for the original tracks (of 5-star material, of course) and a 5 for the first-time-available live version. It would likely have really been something sure enough had it also included \\"Echoes\\", but oh well...this is pretty good all the same and, as it is, it's a new day for fans of the album. And if you ARE a huge fan of the album like me and had the remaster itself been the equal of the (brutallyexpensive and hard-to-find) MoFi disc, this edition would no doubt have been THE music CD recommedation of 2011 (short of the Immersion) to make for stereo listeners. But, this is still HIGHLY recommended for the Live at Wembley disc alone!! Buy it just for that!
B004UBM4TA|5.0|The documentary covers what hubble telescope can see, but also on the astronaut prep for upgrade and shuttle launch.I was speechless seeing the inside of nebula. The content is most enlighten of any documentary about deeper space.  Being a big space advocate and live dreams through Star Trek, this is both inspiring and depressing. Inspired by what man kind has done to construct such telescope and send to orbit and see what's out there in deep space. Depressed because we don't have an engine travelling fast enough (warp engine) in our lifetime to explore in person.  3D is shown for working in space (in-screen 3D) and travelling through the stars (some out-of-screen). It's definitely worthwhile for those collecting 3D for enjoyment and demo.  This price here is currently pretty steep. There are better price out there.
B004ZNARH4|5.0|The marbles included with this box set are the best marbles ever included with any classic album box set. I love them. They're smooth and round.
B000YMQIVO|5.0|If you really want to hear crazy train the way Ozzy and Randy wanted it to sound, then get the vinyl version of this album. I hear that the new remastered vinyl version sounds better, but this one sounds great.
B005COO1X6|4.0|With King, it's either extraterrestrials or demonic forces of some kind. This was no exception, but I still like his storytelling abilities. He's our Dickens, and all I can say is I regret his cussin'.I can't say I would buy this one, though (I didn't). If you can find a free copy to read, it's worth your 45 minutes. Kind of like watching an hour-long TV program.
B002LCOQVY|5.0|If you are into Kraftwerk, then you need to buy this vinyl version of Trans Europe Express. I will not talk about how great the album is. You should know that by now. This is a review of the quality of this vinyl version. The quality is stunning. Perfect. I listen to it on my Techincs with an Orotfon cartridge. The sound is deep and lush. You can hear things you have never heard before. This is one of the few remastered versions of any album that actually sounds better than the original. It is what's expected from a heavy 180g LP. If you own Trans Europe Express on older LPs, CDs, or crappy mp3s, throw them all away and just listen to this version. This is the album that should make you go out and buy a turntable if you dont already own one. Even if you do not by this album, you should really think of getting a turntable. Make buying music fun again, instead of downloading crappy mp3s from bitorrent sites or from iTunes. Do humanity a favor and help support the vinyl revolution. Long Live Vinyl!!
0553801473|2.0|The first three books in this series are a wonderful reinvention of a tired genre, the epic fantasy novel. Many have compared Martin to Tolkein in the process, and it's true that they have each invented a complete Otherworld, real and yet alien, filled with acutely realized characters.<br /><br />But Martin stumbled in Book Four, and falls in this, Book Five in the series.<br /><br />There's some good here. Thankfully, Tyrion is back, and Arya continues to be a complex and enigmatic character. Some of the intrigue on the Wall, with winter falling, is gripping. When the dragons eventually appear, they are as fearsome as dragons should be.<br /><br />But much of the rest of this book is dull nonsense (please fans, don't flame me!). It goes on, and on, and on, and on. I skipped pages of filler. Many of the plot-turns feel false and hurried. In the final chapters the book falls apart. There are so many incidental characters it becomes pointless to try and follow the numerous sub-plots that in any event aren't interesting. I could go on, but I'd be committing Martin's sin of saying far too much over and over again.<br /><br />What happened, Mr Martin???
B004XNGKBS|5.0|I've been looking for an app like this for a long time. Essential app for taking quick notes. It keeps a spot on my main screen along with my email and music shortcuts. :-)
0553801503|2.0|Many of the characters in Martin's saga face fearsome odds as they slog around Westeros and elsewhere, through snow, rain and blistering heat. I felt their pain -- often this monsterously long book felt like a slow march to an uncertain destination.  A few faithful characters keep parts of the tale alive - Brienne, Arya - but I found myself skipping whole pages filled with names, lineage, obtuse history, or back stories of back stories. But most of all, I missed Tyrion.  Too bad, the first few books are very, very good.
B0050F6JQE|5.0|This stunning collection of the sublime music of Spanish polyphonist Tomás Luis de Victoria has just been declared winner in the 'Early Music' category of the Gramophone Awards 2012. These awards, known as the 'Oscars of Classical Music' are the most highly regarded prizes in the world of Classical Music:[...]
055357342X|4.0|A few new characters - notably Brienne of Tarth - give new life to this long-running saga. There's no question that in places Martin could have cut back on the details (he writes long, which can be a plus and a minus), but the central characters are so compelling it's hard to put the book down.
B00003CXB4|5.0|Recently I have found out about the whole Lion King - Kimba controversy.  I have looked at the info and arguments involved and I have come to this conclussion:  BOTH SIDES ARE AT FAULT:  Disney is wrong to have denied any relation to Kimba.  Obviously the artwork of the characters and the scenes are inspired from Kimnba and Disney should have just admitted from the beginning that Kimba was an inspiration for the artwork of the scenes and characters in The Lion King.  The story line is based off of HAMLET NOT KIMBA so Kimba has no argument in the storyline aspect.    The people in charge of Kimba are wrong to say that The Lion King is an exact copy of Kimba.  Yes the artwork is pretty much an exact copy in many ways and as I have said above Disney is wrong to deny it.  However The Lion King is NOT an exact copy of Kimba or even a copy besides the artwork.  The one big thing that arguers on the side of Kimba have failed to acknowledge(in all the places I have looked) that the Lion King follows the story of HAMLET.  The story line is not like Kimba it is DIFFERENT so stop saying that Lion King is a copy of Kimba.  IT ONLY IS IN ANIMATION.  That dosent justify Disney but it dosent give Kimba the right to say Disney stole the idea of Kimba and tried to pass it off as their own idea.  I dont know if it is true or not but I did find info saying that Disney said nothing about Lion King being an adaptation of Hamlet until the controversy with Kimba started.  Believe what you wish but I think that there is no way Disney merely stumbled upon a near perfect adaptation of Hamlet.  I think that was the idea from the start with the animation inspired from Kimba but Disney failed to acknowledge this before the movie came out.  So Kimba lovers get over it Disney is at fault for not giving Kimba deserved credit but you are just as at fault if you think Lion King is an exact copy or adaptation of Kimba.  Moving away from it this is a great movie and one of my all time favorites!  Great storyline and animation it has fun things for kids to watch and for Adults it has life lessons that are compelling to think about. Highly recomend this movie to anyone who hasnt seen it!
0553386794|5.0|\\"Game of Thrones\\" is the first and by far the best of Martin's epic saga. If like me you haven't read a book featuring dragons since you where in 6th grade, don't worry -- this definitely isn't a traditional fantasy novel, and it definitely isn't for kids.<br /><br />Great characters, very clever pacing, and a constant uncertainty about what will happen on the next page or to your favorite character make this a riveting read. A fully-realized world that is subtly alien and strange, filled with characters that are very real indeed.<br /><br />Enjoy the HBO series, but read the books too.
B0036EH3XE|4.0|I LOVED the last season! I enjoyed more then season 5. i liked that they did the flash sideways like they did the flashbacks. and i loved that they showed a different outcome for everyone along that timeline, i never really liked the flashbacks some were irrelevant to the story. but season 6 made the most sense to me the only reason i get it a four and a half was because of the ending (really sad)
0553381695|4.0|The 2nd book isn't quite as good as the first, but this is a small quibble. The wonderful structure of the book, where each chapter is taken from a certain character's perspective, continues to drive the plot and give a multi-faceted sense of realism to a fully-realized, subtly alien otherworld.
B004J4WKTW|5.0|This is one of those books that I considered reading several times before I finally downloaded it. The concept spoke to me. A mysterious circus with a shadowy battle between magicians playing out in a dream like setting. My fear was that this plot could go horribly wrong and leave me shaking my head. I am so happy that the author crafted the story in such a way that I was drawn in by curiousity and held there by finely crafted characters and realistic, yet dreamlike, settings.  I dreamed about this circus of dreams, so engrossed was I in this story.
B004A8ZWVK|5.0|I had The Help pegged as another one of those chick lit movies that middle aged women go to see in droves.  After the fiasco that was Eat, Pray, Love, I had a hard time trusting my mother's ability to pick out a film for us to watch.  Female sagas of love and harrowing times seems overdone, clich&eacute;, boring.  I expected The Help to be just another blah movie that left me cold and unsatisfied.<br /><br />The Help is the story of a young college grad named Skeeter, an aspiring journalist, and her attempt to tell the stories of the black maids that lived and worked for white families in Jackson, Mississippi in the early 1960s.  Skeeter is a feisty girl who doesn't want to live the life that society has her pegged for - an obedient housewife who plays bridge and gives birth to babies she won't even care for.  The biggest influence in her life was her family's housekeeper Constantine, the black woman who raised her when her mother ignored her in favor of friends and shopping.  Constantine inspires her to seek out these maids and ask them to tell their stories and experiences, challenging the status quo of society in a great period of racial turmoil in Jackson.  The story combines hope, fear, hatred, and willpower from various viewpoints, telling the stories of various women whose lives are deeply affected by Skeeter's goal.<br /><br />Viola Davis' performance as Aibileen, a maid for a well-to-do Jackson socialite, is impressive, along with Emma Stone's solid performance as Skeeter, but the star of The Help is Octavia Spencer's amazing and heartfelt portrayal of Minnie.  While only a supporting role, Spencer's performance was superb and Oscar-worthy, bringing together a sense of comedy with fear and anger, not only at the family she works for but also the life that she's been forced to live and pull her children through.<br /><br />The performances are what makes this story and brings it to life.  I haven't read the book and cannot speak for it, but everything I saw on screen felt real and powerful.  The lives of these women, from the maids to the snotty housewives and socialites, from the budding journalists to the despairing young wives trying to satisfy their husbands and their societies, each was affecting and felt true and powerful.<br /><br />I went into the movie expecting boring and dull.  I left satisfied and ready to talk about these times, wanting to know more about the time period and ask my grandparents (from the deep south) about their experiences during the time.  The people in my theater, men and women alike, young and old, black and white, all seemed to enjoy the movie.  I would definitely recommend this movie to anyone, regardless of their potential feelings.  It's a movie worth seeing, especially for the award-caliber performances given by some amazing actresses.he lives of these women, from the maids to the snotty housewives and socialites, from the budding journalists to the despairing young wives trying to satisfy their husbands and their societies, each was affecting and felt true and powerful.

B004EPZ00W|5.0|Every once in awhile, there is a great sports movie that comes out that appeals to fans of the sport and non-fans alike.  I've never been a great baseball fan, but I was dragged to this movie with low expectations.  When I left, I realized just how blown away I was.  The cast displays great chemistry and the performances are excellent all around, with only a few missteps exhibited by the script.  Jonah Hill's performance here is probably the best of his career, augmented by Brad Pitt's stellar portrayal of Billy Beane.<br /><br />Moneyball follows a true story of a horrible MLB team and the general manager who reinvents his team from scratch.  Putting together a ragtag assortment of players and personnel, Beane has to deal with challenges from those around him and observers who call his methods and his goals wrong and against what baseball is about.  It's a touching story complete with laughs and moments where you are rooting for the A's, fan or not.<br /><br />The movie is like a love story to baseball and the things that make the sport so great.  Pitt's performance should hopefully score him a nomination in the Oscar races, pulling so much from his bag of tricks to give a winning performance.  Jonah Hill should be proud of himself for what he proved to the world in this movie, that he isn't just about juvenile jokes and high school humor - even if some does factor into Moneyball.  Some.  The writing and direction are superb.  I was a big fan of The Social Network and was immediately pulled in by the story in Moneyball.  Beane's story and the story of those around him is harrowing and pulling, and they did an excellent job of conveying how important heart and soul are in a world of tradition and rules.<br /><br />If I have to nitpick one thing about the movie, it would be the length.  Cutting a few minutes off this 2+ hour film would have served to tighten it up, but I am not really complaining.  To convince a non-baseball fan like me that this was an excellent movie is hard, but Moneyball did this and then some.  This movie is definitely a must see.this and then some.  This movie is definitely a must see.
B005H5GEQM|5.0|I don't get all these complaints here on Amazon. The DVD I got was perfect. Excellent quality audio and video. Subtitles were good (some parts could have had slightly better translation but I'm picky because I'm an English teacher). The director's commentary was great. Be sure you select the Portuguese audio, not the English audio when you watch the movie. This movie is in Portuguese. You'll get the director's commentary if you select English. BTW, the version I bought here on Amazon was \\"Senna [2010, UK] DVD\\"
B0052CK5PQ|5.0|Moran deals with extremely sensitive and contentious issues with wit, originality and her own individual take. This book forces readers to have a good look at the elephant in the room, some may want to look away, others to tickle its tummy, but whatever we take from the book, the dialogue is open. After almost every page I felt relief, I'm not the only one who's struggling with this 'being a woman' thing - the heels, the ageing process, the power struggles, the pressure to like pink, the discrimination in and outside of work, and, as a mother trying to raise a daughter, this came at just the right time. A sensational book - a must.
B0055V6EZE|5.0|The CD just arrived and wow!  It is really well done.  Will be perfect for late summer evenings on the screen porch with the hound dogs at my feet and a beer in hand.

B0050QV0RQ|5.0|The gameplay is something I've been missing from games for some time. The dialogue is stupid, which leads to an inability to follow the story, since one finds him or herself skipping the dialogue. Despite the bad dialogue, this is a very good game and the best you will currently find for Android.
B005EXA8XC|5.0|A little back-story.....living in the Seattle area I had heard a few nirvana songs off the bleach album but honestly wasn't really that familiar with the band. Many of my in the know friends however, kept hyping the future release of Nevermind and I remember a few attended the record release party. So the day the album came out I stopped by the record store after school and picked up a cassette copy (was 17 at the time).... listening to the album cranked up through my walkman absolutely blew my mind and would be the  soundtrack of my life that fall season.<br /><br />I attended this show about a month later and was right up close to the stage. It was an absolutely electric performance and you could just feel it in the air that you were witnessing something special. I was so stoked that this show had a proper full DVD release other than the few teaser clips as seen on live tonight sold out! The sound and picture quality are phenomenal and all the sights and smells all came rushing back like a trip down memory lane. I feel they were at their peak and this was the greatest time to witness Nirvana and be a fan....It was right before they started exploding into the stratosphere and getting overexposed and dare I say becoming clich&eacute;. They start to lose that exuberance that makes them so special and future performances seem more labored.<br /><br />This show was partially responsible for my indie punk / underground music scene obsession that would last for years.<br /><br />It represents that moment in time in Washington State where nearly every late teen / 20 something was in the same consciousness and doing the same things -<br /><br />* Going to thrift stores and smelling like patchouli<br />* 100+ mile road trips to see bands you thought mattered at some hole in the wall dive<br />* Hanging out at small indie record stores and scoring that hard to find colored vinyl<br />* Working that bummer job to fund your music collection and hanging out.<br />* Sharing a big dilapidated house with a bunch of your punk friends<br />* Vintage instruments and gear was actually affordable for your dream of being in a band and touring in a broken down van.<br />* Staying up all night at greasy spoon diners with your friends drinking copious amounts of coffee trying to figure out the meaning of it all...(no internet! Actually had physical contact with people instead of virtual!)<br />* The damp, rainy dreary weather....and so forth<br /><br />Kurt Cobain lived all these things himself and had an uncanny ability to transfer that whole vibe that generation X was feeling into musical form. That's what makes Nirvana and particularly this show so iconic.ntage instruments and gear was actually affordable for your dream of being in a band and touring in a broken down van.  * Staying up all night at greasy spoon diners with your friends drinking copious amounts of coffee trying to figure out the meaning of it all...(no internet!

B003H9M1QM|5.0|Like Jack Benny and Annette Funicello, it's nearly impossible to find anyone who has anything truly negative to say about Walt Disney's \\"Dumbo,\\" the 1941 animated classic that signaled the pinnacle of Disney storytelling and raw artistry and the end of a golden era that was halted by WWII and a studio strike (which is expertly chronicled within the bonus treasure on this Blu-ray/DVD.<br /><br />\\"Dumbo\\" really looks magnificent in this 70th Anniversary restored version, especially with Blu-ray, but what really delights me is the presence of an excellent new audio commentary. The commentators is historian Paula Sigman, master animator Andreas Deja and Pixar director Pete Docter. There's even a little video about Dumbo in the Disney Parks.<br /><br />The DVD is not missing the key bonus features, which is a nice thing for those who do not have Blu-ray, but there are a few extra games, galleries and cartoons exclusively on the Blu-ray. The biggest addition is the entertaining \\"Disney View\\" system which adds visuals on your computer while the film runs in real time).

B0050QV0RQ|5.0|This is definitely a throwback to good ol'style turn base RPG. Now there's still some new stuff to learn like the different stance, a break limit, and a customizable stats &amp; skills system (that includes your weapon and characters ), but nothing you can't learn from a quick reading in the help section. The plot is average with usual translation mistakes, but no deal breaker. Overall just good old fashion fun!

B004VMVTNU|3.0|A day ago there was an update to this clock that made my day. I had the ability to snooze and cancel individual alarms and was also able to change the color theme. Today there was another update that had taken all that away. Overall this application is amazing and gives you a ton of other options to control and set the way you wake up. This is a great replacement for the stock alarm clock that comes with the DROIDX and any other alarm clock so far.
B005M2A4D4|5.0|Honestly, when you really get down to it, this is the better deal. I originally was going to do just the Part 1 and Part 2 DVDs as I already had the Xmas special, but those DVDs have just the episodes and maybe one or two special features each....compared to THIS set which has these features attached:  A Christmas Carol, The Impossible Astronaut, Day Of The Moon, The Curse Of The Black Spot, The Doctor's Wife, The Rebel Flesh, The Almost People, A Good Man Goes To War, Let's Kill Hitler, Night Terrors, The Girl Who Waited, The God Complex, Closing Time, The Wedding of River Song. SPECIAL FEATURES INCLUDE:  5 X `Night And The Doctor' Additional Scenes  2 X `Comic Relief' Sketches  Commentaries  4 X `The Monster Files'  4 X Prequels  Trailers  14 X `Doctor Who Confidential' Cut-Downs  `Doctor Who Confidential: A Nights' Tale'  THAT is a much better deal if not for the Confidential stuff but also for the prequels, comedy relief sketches and additional scenes you will NEVER see otherwise. SO its like 20 more bucks....big freaking deal. You get so much more cool stuff along with it. THIS is the 6th Series you want to buy!
B004EPZ084|5.0|Seriously...anyone giving this movie less than 5 stars needs to get a bit more humor in their life! This is by far one of the best comedies I have seen in a very long time!

Believe me you will be happy you did!!

0307887898|5.0|I started reading Eric Ries's blog, \\"Startup Lessons Learned,\\" back in October 2008. I was quickly impressed by his technical acumen and the simplicity of his writing. I also enjoyed the breadth of topics covered and how engaging they were.<br /><br />Needless to say, I was glad to hear that he was going to distill all his knowledge into a book, and now that I read the book, I'm glad to say that he didn't disappoint.<br /><br />The book defines a startup as a 1) a human institution designed to 2) create a new product/service under conditions of 3) extreme uncertainty.<br /><br />Notice how the definition doesn't address the size of the venture or its backers or its origins. As long as it is a team building a product with high uncertainty, it is a startup.<br /><br />Eric puts a huge emphasis on \\"validated learning\\" as opposed to \\"failure as a way of learning.\\" He says, \\"a failure to deliver results is due to either a failure to plan adequately or a failure to execute properly.\\" He's all about accountability, which is sorely lacking in so many institutions these day, with the most egregious being Wall Street.<br /><br />Eric goes on to explain the principles of the lean startup with andecodotes of successes and failures in business. One of the most fascinating and very telling for me was the SnapTax story. The fact that a giant company like Intuit could spawn an innovative startup (i.e. a team + a product + high uncertainty) was a nice validation for my unsuccessful push for an R&D department within the companies at which I worked in the past. SnapTax was a team of five individuals that was given freedom to experiement while held accountable throughout the process. The results were impresssive.<br /><br />If nothing else, the reader, especially those running mature companies, should pay close attention to Eric's conclusion. He stresses the points of validating assumptions, rapid testing of ideas, and most importantly, \\"stop wasting people's time.\\"<br /><br />I think that's the most valuable lesson in the entire book. Mature companies that continue to waste their talents' time with banal and insipid tasks are bound to lose those talents and will only be left with lazy, oftentime overpaid individuals that are too comfortable, too politically secure that they can't produce anything new or original even if they tried.<br /><br />Startups are a \\"human institution\\" first and foremost. If the right team isn't in place, you do not have a startup. Nurture those talents and don't waste their time. Only then will the trappings of success adorn your business and you.hat continue to waste their talents' time with banal and insipid tasks are bound to lose those talents and will only be left with lazy, oftentime overpaid individuals that are too comfortable, too politically secure that they can't produce anything new or original even if they tried.

B000JK8OYU|1.0|Im not sure who this is appealing too, the only thing this would be good for is a souvenir for the actual performance. I have not seen the performance so maybe I \\"don't get it\\", but this release is a joke. After the success of #1s they probably thought that people were interested in the beatles and wanted new releases. In reality people are interested in the music the Beatles made together as a band. The entire basis for this album was \\"how can we get 2 unrelated songs and mash them together so it sounds like it kinda works\\", this is not creative in my mind, just limiting. So we get these fantastic Beatles classic songs that are now cut up and spliced with random other elements and it just sounds terrible. I never thought there would be a Beatles album I couldn't enjoy, but this is definitely just that. Just dont let this CD make you think worse of John, Paul, George, and Ringo, they all werent responsible for this mess. This is a pointless release in the Beatles catalog. Listen to the originals of the songs and buy the actual albums instead.
B004EPZ06Q|5.0|so many people were saying that this movie doesn't even compare to the original. their completely wrong. in my opinion this one is much better than the original. lets all face it, the original was good! i've seen it 100 times and know almost every single line in the movie. it's okay when i watch it now, but not funny because i've heard it all before. the sequel was way raunchier, explicit, and just hilarious. it's amazing and anyone who likes comedy movies should love this. its awesome.

Bottom Line: Great Survival Film.

I was hooked on the series because of the great writing and characters. Really wanted to find out what happened to EVERYONE in the story.....feel very let down. In my mind the story is over. I will not be reading the next book....if there is one!
B002SR2PKG|5.0|I first read this a long time ago but since I recently bought the Kindle version I'll give my opinion. I was surprised to still be thoroughly entertained by this book. I had to skip some of the details King goes into, like with the town, but the suspenseful scenes kept me clicking to the next page.   There was a lot of build up for the final confrontation in the end and it would be hard to satisfy every reader with such buildup. I would say I wasn't fully satisfied but nothing is perfect.   Anyways if you haven't read this yet give it a try, especially if you like King.
080508990X|5.0|My son didn't have much interest in learning to talk until we started reading the Brown Bear book every night.  He LOVED IT!  Then we read Polar Bear & Panda Bear since they were in the set.  I was SO glad to find a fourth book in the series!  He really enjoyed Baby Bear and it is so exciting to see his vocabulary and interest in learning grow as he is introduced to Eric Carle books!
0385534639|1.0|I hate to be a nay-sayer, but a nice writing style does not alone make a good book. While this story started out intriguing, it quickly deteriorated into nothing special. I agree we should be finding new young authors, but not at the expense of readers who spend hard-earned money for books. This one just does not have what it takes to make a great book. The writing is ethereal at times, but that quickly fades into pedantic and over-wrought descriptions that repeat themselves. The characters are bland, and given the circumstances should not be. We just DON'T CARE about them. and I often had the feeling I had read this before, or seen in a movie. Sorry, but once again over-hype yields junk. Trust me...save your money. There is talent here waiting to come out, but this high school level book is not the one.
B004L3AR0K|5.0|We were a little stunned to see Anne Hathaway showing her naked breasts so often in this movie.  However, we enjoyed the movie quite well.
B005ELZKWS|2.0|Compared to the first album, this one leaves plenty to be desired-for me, anyway. It's well-recorded but, IMHO, the 1st one rocks harder and more plus I think it's songs are better. I bought it-and (hopefully) will be selling it. And Sammy-if this is the best thing you've ever been involved in, music-wise, I feel for you; the 1st Montrose album blows this thing clean off the map.
B002VPE1AW|5.0|We had seen this movie in the theatre, and when we shared it with friends whom hadn't seen it before, we all enjoyed it as a group.
B0058VW36U|5.0|Great game and love the graphics. If you like angry birds you will love this game.  No problem whatsoever.  Have fun playing.
B0058VW36U|5.0|maybe its because im a guy or maybe its because im an engineer but i find this game way more engrossing than angry birds. its totally awesome. i almost feel bad i got it for free as app of the day! of course i will definitely buy cut the rope 2 when it exists.  only compliants i have is the loading screen is lagtastic. and the reset level button is hard to hit.  sidekic 4g
B000I9VOO4|5.0|The movie To Kill a Mockingbird couldn't be any better.  The book is a true classic, and the movie truly gives homage to the book.  I showed the movie to my ninth grade students who had never read the book.  I began by telling them it was a wonderful movie, but when it started in black and white, they decided it was awful and must be a movie only English teachers like.  When I had to turn it off at the end of class though, they all begged me to keep watching it.  To Kill a Mockingbird is not another film of a classic book that only literature nerds will enjoy.  It's for everybody.

B00006I53S|4.0|If you are coming from a lower end kit lens (18-55mm), this will be a very nice lens.  It will give you greater telephoto capabilities, useful image stabilization, and decent performance.  This lens is NOT pro quality by any stretch, but for a $440 retail it's pretty darned good.  If you look around on various photo buy/sell boards you can find it for as low as $250 brand new.  This is because Canon has flooded the market with these lenses by offering them as a kit lens bundled with various new camera bodies.  This was probably a good business move on Canon's part, but it's of questionable value to the end user and it has caused the 2nd hand value of these lenses to absolutely plummet.  But I digress...<br /><br />This lens is a fairly old design and it is showing it's age a bit.  It has older generation image stabilization and questionable image quality by most standards.  That said, it is the best general purpose zoom in this price range you can buy.  It's better than the Tamron and better than the Sigma.  If you've got $400 and need a do-it-all lens, this is about the best you can do.<br /><br />Here is my summary of the lens.<br /><br />STRENGTHS:<br />- Very useful focal length range - especially on full frame.  28mm is moderately wide and 135 is moderately telephoto.  On an APS-C sensor you don't really get much of a wide angle from it, but the telephoto is enhanced.<br />- Image stabilization helps with the slower apertures.  Expect to be able to hand hold the lens at 1/4-1/2 the shutter speed that you would without stabilization.<br />- Reasonably quick autofocusing speed.  Focusing was reliable for me on a 5D Mark II.<br />- Comes with a lens hood.  It's small, but it does provide valuable protection for the front element.<br />- Guaranteed forward and backward compatibility with all Canon cameras (Sigma, Tamron, etc, can't offer this).<br /><br />WEAKNESSES:<br />- Mediocre build quality.  There is slop in the lens barrel and the zoom grip doesn't want to stay put.<br />- Just \\"ok\\" image quality.  Near the center of the frame sharpness is quite good, but quality falls off rapidly near the edges of of a full frame camera.  It's a better choice for APS-C than full frame in this regard.<br />- The zooming action is not smooth.  Zoom will frequently stick as you zoom in and out, making it difficult to be precise with zooming.<br /><br />If you have a bit more of a budget and only shoot with an APS-C size sensor, the newer Canon EFS 15-85 is much better than this lens and offers what is generally considered to be a more useful focal length.  If you shoot full frame and have more of a budget, the Canon 24-70 is far better than this lens as well.  However if you want a quality general purpose lens this lens is really tough to beat at this price point.ame sharpness is quite good, but quality falls off rapidly near the edges of of a full frame camera.

B004ZNACA6|2.0|I already buy all these albums at least 3 times, including Shine On, the first box set made many years ago.  I didn't buy Oh By The Way because I fortunately has the opportunity to listen it first before buying and the music sound exactly as the 1990's remastered CD's, so I was lucky I guess.  But with this box set I was incredibly excited because the company records announce in this occasion the albums will be, and I use the same words used by them, PAINSTAKINGLY DIGITALLY REMASTERED, so I thought finally someone will made justice for this incredibly music making the remastered process that these albums deserves.  But don't let them fool you as they fool me, the 2011 remastered sound excatly the same as Oh By The Way or the 1990's remastered CD's and this is a huge disappointment and totally waste of money.  If you are a new fan and you don't have these albums then this box set is for you but if you already have them there is no reason to buy the box set.  The statment PAINSTAKINGLY are very misleading and you end up with another copy with the same sound of the same albums again, ridiculos and tottaly lack of respectful to their loyalty fans.  In 2009 I buy the 40th anniversary edition of the album Odessa by the Bee Gees, and the remastered process made by Rhino was totally amazing, I was so happy, so excited I almost cry when I listen the whole album, why Capitol Records can't do the same with Pink Floyd's albums, why you don't take your time and make this remastered with the love and care that they deserve!!!!!
B004U52VPS|5.0|It's probably all been said, but here it goes. Great game. Good idea. Dislike the fact that the blocks are not oriented the same as the cards. And wow!What a little slingslot not bad for all plastic. I hadn't anticipated the slingshot to do much so I had a distance of roughly 2ft. I'm not certain what the directions 'require' as I bet the majority of us will modify and make our own rules.

B0018BF1HW|3.0|I had a couple of Jeff Beck CD's and I liked a few songs on them so I thought I'd try this set to get a better perspective on Jeff Beck. I think he's a great guitar player but guess his style just isn't for me. Most of it seems like it's some sort of Jazz inspired. I tend to like something with an easy to follow beat or rhythm  and for most of the music on these CD's I'm just a bit lost. Sorry for the bad review. I'm not one of those that thinks he can't play as well as other I just can't understand his style.
1419702203|5.0|What immediately impressed me about this book was how beautful it is in quality and production. Just turning the pages to view the beautifully-reproduced photos was a delight. I so wish \\"Linda McCartney: Life in Photographs\\" had been done in this same quality paper and reproduction.   This book is a treasure, and I thank Olivia & Dhani for giving us this loving look into George - a complex and incredible man. I especially enjoyed the many photographs taken by George - seeing life through his lens. My favorites were the double exposure self-portrait and those of the other FABS. I enjoyed the thoroughness of this book, the many early photographs, and the short, intimate, insightful thoughts of those close to George.   If I have one complaint, and it is not specific to this book but to so many photo books, it is the design choice to have a photo on a 2-page spread and to place the subject right in the middle crevice between the 2 pages. I would rather see it smaller on 1 page with the subject perfectly viewable. But, again, that is a personal gripe I have with many books (including the Linda McCartney book), and certainly does not take away from enjoying George's book.  I highly recommended this book for Beatles fans, and for anyone who wants a look at a fascinating man, without all the gossip and filler added.  It would make a wonderful gift. Again, my compliments and thank you to the Harrison Family. I am really looking forward to the documentary!
B004EPZ07U|5.0|When I heard that Green Lantern was being produced and emulated to the big screen. I knew I wanted to see it. I love the Green Lantern out of most DC superheroes because of the fact that it took the idea of overcoming fear through adversity and courage, and determination. Despite what I heard from others about this film, I knew I wanted to prove them wrong; and I did. Fantastic film for the summer, and I found something spiritual about the Green Lantern... how as a Christian, when you put on the ring, it's like once you commit your life to Christ, there's no going back when you answer his calling. Because you don't choose the ring, the ring chooses you. The idea that you can create anything you see in your mind through the power of a ring is to me, absolutely, undeniably brilliant. So my friends, I hope you enjoy watching the Green Lantern as much as I did; in addition, Ryan Renolds did an awesome job portraying the role of Hal Jordan... the greatest Green Lantern of all time.
1400031567|4.0|When I had been to a Screening of the Swedish \\"The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo\\" in Delhi last year, a lady with the Swedish Embassy whom I had a conversation with told me \\"If you loved Steig Larsson, you will ADORE Henning Mankell and Kurt Wallander\\"<br /><br />Having met Henning Mankell earlier this year at JLF and listening to him speak. I knew I just HAD to start reading him. The BBC series \\"Wallander\\" just had me further intrigued. But it also made me lazy - If I could watch a well made tv series, should I spend more time on reading the books? Especially when my pile of \\"to read\\" books is toppling over itself?<br /><br />I'm really glad for myself, that I answered that question with a \\"Yes\\"! I'd admired Mankel's plots through the televised series, but there is so much more than just a plot and a story in his books. The descriptions of the way of life, procedures etc give the reader an insight into life in Sweden. Since I read in English, I'm not sure if anything is being lost in translation, but even if it is, the books are still wonderful reads.<br /><br />However, the plots are definitely not a reflection on life in Sweden. Sweden has one of the lowest crime rates in the world, but the highest number of crime fiction writers in the world.<br /><br />The plot begins with an unidentified girl committing suicide by setting herself on fire in a field, a former minister of justice is butchered and the body count just keeps piling up like a Tarantino movie and Inspector Kurt Wallander is forced to struggle to keep his professional life from destructing his personal life.

B001RNO7D0|5.0|I was looking for a decent shoe that can be used for travelling, hiking, running, walking, casual wear and I also want it to be comfortable and durable, thats a big ask  I think I found it with the Teva Riva Event  Its a nice looking shoe and will not be out of place at work or out for dinner at a resturant  But it is a wolf in sheeps clothing  out of the box I took these for a 4km run and they performed well, not too heavy, no undue discomfort and felt plenty of grip (was in the dry) they have vibram soles so I expect they will also be good in the wet.  I ordered my normal size 10US and they are firm which is how I like a shoe I don't need to do the laces up too tight and they hold to my feet, I also expect the leather to give a little as they mold to my feet shape.  If you like to be able to wear thicker socks then 1/2 size bigger will definitely be better choice.  maybe these won't last as long as more purpose made hiking shoes, time will tell, however I think they are still \\"good value for money\\" as they are well priced considering the materials used for their construction  looking forward to seeing how these Teva Riva Events last!

0553801473|5.0|This books dust jacket proudly mentions that George R. R. Martin is known as the \\"American Tolkien\\". With all due respect, besides both working in the genre of middle age fantasy they have almost nothing in common. The Tolkien trilogy was published in its entirety in less than two years. The complete story adhered to traditional rules of storytelling with a beginning, buildup, climax and ending and the reader knew the general path the story was going down and what an expected conclusion would look like (destroying the Ring of Doom) while Martin's book is essentially just a chronicling of events in sort of a swords and sorcery soap opera. Martin is now in his fifth book with at least two more planned. The first book was publishing in 1996 and at this pace would likely not finish before 2023 meaning it would optimistically span 27 years and that's IF Martin actually ends the series after seven books as he's predicting. I think there's pretty good odds the series may get extended. My copy of the Lord of the Rings trilogy is 1008 pages long, 32 pages less than A Dance with Dragon's. The audio disc for this book is over TWO SOLID DAYS LONG!!! There is an appendix at the end of the book with a couple lines of dialogue describing each character. It's 53 pages long. In other works Tolkein's masterpiece is a quick sprint compared to Martin ultra marathon.<br /><br />I finally finished the marathon that is `A Dance With Dragons' and all the criticisms that have been leveled again George R.R. Martin are on display here. Martin is all over the place introducing storylines and characters and then dropping them. This book is the compliment to `A Feast for Crows' focusing on the characters and storylines omitted from that book. We revisit Bran Stark, Jon Snow, Tyrion Lannister. So after 959 pages what exactly happened? Let me just say a lot less than one might expect given the length. Martin's writing is as superb as always and this may be his best yet but he writes like he suffers from attention deficit disorder. The storyline with Bran was quite intriguing but before the half way point of the book it just stops. Likewise we spend a bit of time with Davos Seaworth before Martin seems to just forget he exists. Of all the storylines the one with Stannis Baratheon was the one that had me the most riveted but with several hundred pages left in the book Martin stopped writing about Stannis leaving his fate for the next book.<br /><br />Ah, the next book, `The Winds of Winter'. Based on the writer's current pace I would expect it no earlier than 2017 at which point all the cliffhangers will be distant memories. Martin spends a bit of time in the latter half of the book on the OTHER half of the characters (Cersei, Jamie, Arya etc..) It had been so long since I'd read `A Feast for Crows' that I'd completely forgotten that Cersei had been imprisoned. It's really hard to be on the edge of your seat for 6 years. It's not that I'm asking George Martin to crank up his productivity but I wish he could focus. The storyline with Davos could have been jettisoned with no effect on the greater book and he is just one of a ton of extraneous characters including Victarion Greyjoy and Quenyn Martell that do little to advance the main storyline. Martin is so good with characterization it feels blasphemous to ask him to trim characters but there has to be a limit or this series will never end which would be tragic for those who have stuck with it for 15 years.<br /><br />As might be evident by the title this book focuses on Daenerys Targaryen and her three dragons who are getting closer to full maturity. Many of the surrounding storylines revolve around this central thread. Tyrion has long since been my favorite character and he's used tremendously but sadly his role is essentially inconsequential and again could probably have been trimmed. We get to peer within the very mysterious Lady Melisandre but again Martin only seems to tease and just when I really wantedto see more of her Martin gave me less. Sometimes I wonder if I regret ever getting into the series and not because it's bad but because it's so good. Time will tell whether we actually ever see an ending but I shall try and patiently wait for the next book and see if my memory can last the length of time until it's published.to see more of her Martin gave me less.

B005D51JQQ|2.0|I'll keep it simple since other reviews here have captured the details. Bottom-line: 1)beautiful packaging, 2) great songs but, 3) WAY overpriced. Very dissapointing.
0765365278|4.0|I really liked this book -- it's a giant tome, but I was getting on a long flight and that was exactly what I wanted.  Classic epic fantasy in the mould of Robert Jordan or George R. R. Martin.  The world seemed to have a lot of depth, with different cultures, prehistory, and foreshadowing.  All great stuff.  Then I finished the book, and I looked for more information.  When would the next book be out?  That's when I discovered a terrible thing:  The plan is for this to be the first in a TEN BOOK SERIES.  Oh, Brandon Sanderson, no!  At the rate these things work, I will be reading these books to my grandchildren (and my daughter is only 18 months old).
0525423281|5.0|Even. Better. Than. Anna.  And that's saying something.  I knew I was going to love this from the moment I read the blurb. Cricket is an inventor (and so is the hubby--25 patent applications, thank you very much). It takes place in San Francisco (which is our city). And Stephanie Perkins wrote it (and we all know her words are magic. MAGIC! Everything she writes is oozing with amazingness.)  Lola surpasses all expectations. When you read these words, you FEEL everything. Lola's embarrassment, her sadness, her longing...and the sparks every time Cricket touches her. How does Stephanie Perkins weave these spells? I can't remember the last time I felt quite like this reading a book...this heart all a-flutter feeling where you're holding your breathe waiting for them to touch. Oh, wait--I can. It was when I read Anna and the French Kiss.  Lola is a story of finding yourself, and finding the one you love. And Stephanie Perkins writes chemistry like no other. Sigh.  I can't wait to see what Stephanie has in store for Isla, and she uses the events in Lola to set the scene perfectly for Isla to ensure all our favorite characters will be back.  Go read this book. And then read it again because that's what I'm going to do right now. (I swear, this book must be laced with some kind of addictive substance...or else Stephanie Perkins' pacing and characters and writing are PERFECT.)

B0050CJNJ2|4.0|Lady Antebellum delivers a solid album in Own The Night, granted, it wasn't quite what I expected in the wake of the wildly successful Need You Now. It has a slower sound compared to their self-titled album and Need You Now. I thought it was a bit heavy in ballads but it was evident this album was a dedication to love and love rejected. I miss the energy and tempo Lady A brought to songs like \\"Stars Tonight\\", \\"Perfect Day\\", \\"Love This Pain\\", \\"Our Kind of Love\\", \\"Looking For A Good Time\\", and \\"I Run to You\\". That being said, Charles and Hillary complement each other very well vocally that it's impossible for me not to like anything they sing (along with Dave on backing vocals). Despite a couple songs I didn't really enjoy that much, this is an album I'd willingly listen to and sing along to time and time again. Here's a run-down of my impressions/opinions on each song:  \\"We Owned The Night\\" - 8/10 - The title track starts the album off pretty well. It's an upbeat song and definitely one of the better tracks on the album. This song pretty much sets the theme of this album (feeling on top of the world being in a new relationship/reflecting on memories of that affection).   \\"Just a Kiss\\" - 9/10 - This song is one of my favorites on the album, enough so, that it's been my phone ringtone since the song was released as a single. I especially love the blend of piano, drums, and vocals.  \\"Dancing Away With My Heart\\" - 7/10 - A good slow song but it didn't immediately grab me as a single. Still worth a listen.   \\"Friday Night\\" - 6/10 - I thought the rushed words clashed with the instrumental portions of the song. Despite listening to this song multiple times, I'm still not sure this song really appeals to me. It had the potential to be a good upbeat song but I would have preferred a different track in place of this one.  \\"When You Were Mine\\" - 7/10 - Continues the trend of songs that are relationship based but doesn't really stand out on its own.  \\"Cold As Stone\\" - 9/10 - I love this ballad. Definitely one of the highlights of this album. Charles is my favorite male singer in country music today because his voice is always so emotive and he doesn't disappoint in this song!  \\"Singing Me Home\\" - 6/10 - Maybe it was just me, but I didn't really like this song that much.   \\"Wanted You More\\" - 8/10 - I liked the mix of vocals and instrumentals in this song.  \\"As You Turn Away\\" - 9/10 - One of my favorite songs on Own The Night. I think this one would have been better as a single instead of Dancing Away With My Heart. Hillary's vocals really shine in this song.   \\"Love I've Found In You\\" - 7/10 - An upbeat song with a good tune.    \\"Somewhere Love Remains\\" - 8/10 - Another ballad about love. I think by now, I would have liked another theme. Still a good song.  \\"Heart of the World\\" - 10/10 - I would say that this song is the best on the album. Lady A really knows how to pick select songs that they haven't written themselves that fit them perfectly (just like \\"Hello World\\").

Now i know they have Children of the corn 3,5 and 6 on blu ray and they look terrible and echo bridge and image entertainment need to go out of business because they are ruining good sequels. I really want anchor bay to release children of the corn 2-7 on blu ray. Heck lions gate, universal any company that does not suck and released te sequels on blu ray all 1080p, i will be happy. Crossing fingers. ps: i think echo bridge are releasing children of the corn 3,4,5,6 on blu ray in 1 box. Not sure what company but i know its gonna suck.

B005F9CPG8|5.0|I know that the 2009 remasters of the Beatles' material are controversial; a lot of people love them and a lot of others think they suck. Personally, I can't comment on most of the new remasters, because I still don't have most of them. I love the original version of this comp (which is also hated by a lot of folks), and while I don't know if this \\"new\\" version is really \\"better,\\" I certainly can tell a difference. It's a bit weird; the songs seem to me to have a bit less \\"punch\\" than the older remasters, but at the same time, I think they sound a bit \\"clearer\\"; I can hear some sounds that I couldn't hear as well on the older remasters. (That cowbell --- or whatever it is --- on \\"Help!\\" really jumps out at me!) The original 2000 release of this comp earned its place as my \\"desert island\\" CD, and while I haven't decided if this \\"update\\" can really replace (or displace) it, this version still sounds great to me. This CD was actually a bit hard for me to rate; I had difficulty deciding whether to give it four or five stars. I decided on five because, like I said before, the songs seem \\"clearer\\" to me than they do on the earlier remasters. I consider that to be a big positive, despite the fact that the songs seem less \\"punchy\\" to me. Of couse, I know that a lot of people will disagree with me, but then, my views aren't intended to be gospel. Whether a CD sounds \\"good\\" or \\"bad\\" is really subjective; all I can do is say what *I* think. As for my 2000 copy of the collection, I'm still not going to abandon it, at least not yet.
B0034G4ORM|5.0|This movie obviously wont get anyone starring in it an \\"Oscar\\" but the sound designers should! Your surround speakers will get quite the workout with this flick. Something most movies largely neglect. I was using Avatar to help calibrate my 5.2 sound system but this movie is in the top spot now.<br /><br />Oh, and the picture quality is second to none!<br /><br />I didn't think much of the movie when I saw it at the theaters but after I got it home it was better than I thought. Battle:LA audio is hardore and if you have a well calibrated surround sound system you will feel like you're really there. It's a solid \\"action\\" B-movie. Mabey B++!...
B0002B15XI|4.0|This original movie was the front-runner and inspiration of the wonderful TV series. I liked this one with the the quirkly surgeons and looney characters; but overall what I always enjoy is the infusion of humanity and genuine caring.  It's truly loaded with slapstick comedy, loads of fun and of course, the tragedy of war. It was totally deserving of an Oscar nomination for Best Picture.  I recommend that you watch it again.
B003IY49S4|5.0|...but this comes pretty darn close. Add Volume Two of the Perfect Collection, and you have some of the finest jazz ever recorded, complete with all the performance/original release details, for an incredible low price.
B004EBT5CU|3.0|I am really not going to start writing reviews on other singers, I promise. Being one myself, I know when I do a great job and when I don't. So I am not here to talk about Adele. I am here to ask why, in 2011, anyone would record her the way they did. I, too, have a bit of a problem overloading microphones. The difference is, I kept working with engineers until I found a way to mic my voice that did not require compressing the crap out of it and STILL distorting.<br /><br />Somebody give this gal a mic that can handle her SPLs and let her rip. She has an amazingly expressive voice that needs to actually be heard. I would hate to never be able to buy another CD from this woman, but it makes my skin crawl to hear her distort.<br /><br />If you can't find a mic that works, give me a shout. LOL.<br /><br />Long live big voices!
B0050CJNJ2|4.0|Another solid record from Lady Antebellum.  When the first two albums pack as much punch as the self-titled debut and the follow up \\"Need You Now\\" it leaves fans expecting perfection.  The album isn't perfect, but it's definitely worth buying.    You can tell that the band is at a different place in their lives as most of the new songs are about love and the heartbreak before you find that love.  I had hoped for more upbeat songs.  This album was mostly love ballads with a few fun ones in-between.  ~We Owned the Night - Musically the best song on the album.  With all the hype I had expected this to be about finding a new confidence or overcoming obstacles, instead it's a love story about a one night stand - but beautiful all the same.  ~Just a Kiss - Sweet love song.  A bit refreshing to hear a song so innocent.  ~Dancin' Away With My Heart - LOVE this song.  Very sweet song that will have you reminiscing about high school and your first love.  ~Friday Night - An upbeat song about finding someone who makes you a priority.  ~When You Were Mine - Love lost...  nice melody.  Hillary takes the lead on this one.  A little blah.  ~Cold as Stone - More love lost... with a little Irish twist.  ~Singing Me Home - You will be singing this all the way home and everywhere else.  Great tune, very simple, but very catchy.  Beautiful.  ~Wanted You More - Love lost again... musically it's not a bad song; unfortunately it blends in with the rest of the songs with the same theme.  ~As You Turn Away - and again.  Another slow one about losing love.  The piano and dynamic changes give the song a little more feeling.  ~Love I've Found in You - Love found!  Most country sounding tune on the album.  ~Somewhere Love Remains - Beautiful refrain and great melody.  ~Heart of the World - Another slow one.  I love the line \\"We're meant to be, baby hold on to me\\" but the song is too slow for me.
B005G4TJI4|5.0|So I got home from work today and I asked my wife if she got the mail. She said she did and I got TF3 which I thought it was odd because it's suppose to come out tomorrow. Well lucky me, I have it a day early. I do have the Amazon Prime service which I shall now refer to the Amazon Optimus Prime service.  And no I have not opened the case for fear the FBI are watching me. j/k
B003UESJEM|3.0|This is such an enjoyable movie. It's really relevant to what's is going on in today's economy. Well casted, it gives us an inside look at greed and corruption on and inside level. This is John Wells first movie and it's a terrific job by him. If you like ER, then you\\"ll love this.
B002I0J5FG|5.0|ICO and Shadow of the Colossus are both arguably two of the best games that were released on the PS2 (originally released in 2002 and 2006, respectively) and have had a cult following with its loyal fans since. A few months ago Team ICO announced that HD updates of these classic games would be released and since then I have been dying in anticipation. Finally the other day my preorder arrived and after spending quite a lot of time with both games I can honestly say that these games are actually even better than I can remember them being.<br /><br />Both games are extremely atmospheric, unique, eerie, beautiful and most importantly, incredibly fun to play. In ICO you are a young horned boy who must help a girl escape a prison, whilst Shadow of the Colossus you must bring down 16 gigantic and different beasts.<br /><br />It is instantly obvious after trying both that more time has been spent updating the visuals on ICO than on Shadow of the Colossus - the textures and colour on ICO are a lot more rich and the graphics even look a lot more updated, whereas Shadow of the Colossus (although still looks stunning) does sometimes look not far different from the original PS2 version, just with a more glossy finish on it.<br /><br />Trophy fans will be pleased as both games have their own collection to earn, some easier than other (complete ICO in 2 hours being one of them - is this even possible?) but a great addition which will surely provide a lot more replay value to both titles.<br /><br />Overall, whether you have never played these games before and want to see for yourself what all the fuss is about or if you've played these games before and want to re-try them in all their HD glory then I highly recommend this game. There really are no other games out there like this and it is honestly the closest art and gaming has been.
0061733199|5.0|This book is very thick, very detailed, and well-accredited.  It seems like it's got a lot of useful information in it, and would come in handy in the event of an emergency.  I'd recommend this for anyone to have around.

B0052UZIFA|5.0|This app Is well worth the money. Lots of levels new plants and zombies in each one. The game doesn't end, but you replay the levels only they become more difficult.
B003EY7IRC|5.0|Absolutely amazing book and series.  I love all this author's books, but this one is by far my favorite.  Most books I read and then trade in at a used book store, but not Karen's books.  She has a permant spot on my book shelf.  I've read this series several times and never get tired of it and I don't think I ever will.  I'm sure I will read it many times more in the future.  I've met Karen twice and she is such a sweet person. She is very concerned about her fans and their feelings, even when she was extremely sick, her fans were what she was worried about.  And we, as her fans, care very much about her as a person.  She isn't just a name on the book to us.
B005LY4B0A|5.0|One of the best apps. Reminiscent of angry birds, but requires more planning. Cut, burn and trick to keep the spiders away from the bugs!
B0058VW36U|5.0|This game is puzzles and strategy. Cut the rope swing the candy and feed your nom. Multiple levels each with new elements.
B004ZN9RWK|4.0|Did they go back to the original analog master tapes to do this remaster? I doubt it. Once a really good digital master is made all project engineers have to do is go back to a previous DIGITAL remaster and tweak with it a little instead of going back to the original master tapes at all to start all over again. They probably don't go back to the original tapes for risk of damaging the nearly 40 year old original masters. There have been several remastered versions of The Dark Side of the Moon most people don't know about. I have about 12 of them that all sound a little different including a Japanese black triangle, 2 different black face Harvest versions, the MFSL Gold disc, the early US common version (which was pretty good but full of tape hiss), the 20th Anneversay version, the Shine On box set version, the SACD which included a regular version on it, the latest common version (with the newer cover that's been out there everywhere for 10 years or so) and a few others. They all have slight strengths and weaknesses, most of which I hear as tape noise difference, volume difference and what I simply term as \\"presence\\" which is what means a lot to me. This new version sounds fine but not head and shoulders different than some of the previous versions. This sounds just like the 2003 SACD version to me (but the regular part not the SACD part) and that's from my using two exact same CD players with the CDs synced up at the exact same place and then use the remote to switch back and forth to A/B compare as they play. First with speakers for a little while then I listen intently with high-end headphones. If you do this try not to let volume levels themselves make a difference and make sure they are the same exact brand and model CD players hooked up to your stereo. When volumes ARE different on an original and a remaster some people say \\"Wow that's much better\\" when it is often just volume level difference they are hearing. The volume on the SACD (regular part) and this new 2011 version are exactly the same anyway. Overall I can't tell ANY difference in this new 2011 version and the basic CD part of the SACD version from 2003. I think it is the same version - NOT going back to the original tapes at all but just back to the SACD 2003 digital remaster. Good old EMI / Capitol knows how to milk that money - like the Beatles remasters. A few of the early Beatles releases were really better than their original counterparts but most of the later releases had just very tiny improvement if at all. There is a bit more difference in this new 2011 version of The Dark Side of the Moon and the common version (the one with newer cover that's been out there for 10 years or so) but not much. Maybe FIVE percent difference at the most with just a little difference in volume level and EQ. I wish the people that remaster CDs would put out a log or mini-journal of sorts on each project quoting chapter and verse all the changes they took to make a new version sound different than a previous release. I think this version is an almost exact duplicate version of the 2003 SACD (the regular version on that). It sounds exactly like it to me in A/B comparison.  All that being said, I actually think the version that overall feels right to you and that you enjoy the most once you've finished listening to it is the one that really is the best one for you. My favorite version of The Dark Side of the Moon was released many years ago and is now off the market. I give the new 2011 version five stars for content (of course) but took off a star for it not being an entirely new version from the original analog tapes...and I hate digipaks anyway.

YOU MUST WATCH THIS MOVIE!
0142419400|4.0|The door to her tiny dorm room snicks shut, signaling her parent's departure.  Anna finds herself alone.  Alone in Paris!  She doesn't speak French and she only knows the typical, touristy details about France.  She is to start her senior year at an elite boarding school for American students in Paris, a city where she does not know a single soul.  Tears and choking, snuffling sobs ensue as she thinks of her friends, family and the familiarity of her life in Atlanta.  A light tap at the door; a cup of hot chocolate and a new friend, Meredith; things might not be as bad as they seem.  Anna  begins her new life in Paris.  She is quickly introduced into Meredith's tight circle of friends, Rashmi, Josh, and the devastatingly handsome Etienne St. Clair.  During her school year, Anna adapts slowly and tentatively to her new surroundings, she learns a bit of French, forms some life long friendships and ultimately loses her heart.<br /><br />What I Liked:<br />*Anna, she is a character that is easy to relate to.  Her constant chatter is witty and funny, yet it is realistic. You experience the terror, loneliness and the language barrier that Anna endures during her first few weeks in Paris.  You feel her awkwardness and shyness as you see her blunder and bumble.  As she struggles you watch her transform and you cheer her on as she follows her heart.  Anna is so well written that she seems like a long, lost friend.  She is a remarkable, literary creation.<br />*Etienne St. Clair.  Of course many girls out there will lose their hearts to him.  I like that he is real and vulnerable; especially when his fear of heights is exposed. He is friendly, charming and nice.  I admire the way he suffers under the strain of some difficult challenges and learns to overcome them.<br />*The friendship between Anna and Etienne.  This is the aspect that I enjoyed the most.  Ms. Perkins manages to capture all the emotions, angst and drama that go into the creation of a fledgling romance.  There is the building up of a perfect, relaxed and comfortable friendship, that fits like a well worn pair of shoes. Then when feelings begin to swirl toward intimacy you feel the awkwardness, timidity and hesitancy to progress the friendship to a romantic level.  The author conveys this through a simple touch, a brush of a leg, a look and the second guessing.  The relationship builds slow and steady, on occasion it stutters but it continually pulls you toward the ultimate french kiss.  When you finally reach this all important kiss (obviously this is not a spoiler since it is the title of the book) it is everything you expect it to be, tender, lovely and sweet.  It will melt your heart and leave you grinning.<br />*The French setting.  I admit I am among the countless other readers out there whose knowledge of Paris consists of the Eiffel Tower, french food, Notre Dame and it being the city of love.  Anna grabbed my hand and took me through Paris.  I loved being able to experience and see the sites of Paris through her eyes. I could almost smell and taste the delectable food.  I came away with a new appreciation of Paris.  I want to visit immediately.<br /><br />And The Not So Much:<br />*The book is predictable, especially since the title gives it away.  You know when the relationship stumbles that it is still headed for the big, dramatic kiss but the fun part is relating to Anna as she matures and changes and you sigh when her wish comes true.<br />The book moves slowly.  Sometimes it is even frustrating.  I was thinking okay wait for it, wait for it, is it now?...No!  Drat...wait, wait.... and then bliss and happiness.  Trust me be patient it is worth it in the end.<br />*The characters are real.  They are warm, friendly and comfortable.  You are included in Anna's circle of friends.  My only regret was that I missed Meredith's voice.  When she first appears I was drawn to her.  As the story progresses she is absent a great deal of the time.  She was in the background, I got to know Josh and Rashmi but I only got a glimpse of Meredith's character.  I wanted her to participate more.<br />*The only hesitation for recommending this book for teens of all ages is there is some teenage drinking and bit of adult language.  For the most part it is a charming story that readers of all ages will enjoy.<br /><br />Anna and the French Kiss brings Paris alive in it's pages. It is a book that will wrap around you like your favorite blanket.  The story is funny, warm and realistic.  It grips your heart and makes you smile.  This is an exceptional debut novel.  One that I recommend you put on your book shelf.  Look for the companion novel Lola and the Boy Next Door, released September 27, 2011.<br /><br />Favorite Quotations:<br /><br />\\"It's true what they say about white sneakers.  Only American tourists wear them, big ugly things made for mowing grass or painting houses.\\"<br /><br />\\"I see the hint of golden apple tarte tatins.  The edge of a glossy chocolate-and-raspberry gateau.\\"<br /><br />\\"It shimmers with neat rows of square-shaped tarte citrons, spongy cakes swelling with molten chocolate, caramel eclairs like ballet slippers, and red fruity cakes with wild strawberries dusted in powdery sugar.\\"<br /><br />\\"Nah.

B004LROMSO|5.0|I cant believe Starz canceled this show! I was going to stop watching it anyways after they killed off my favoirte character. Morgan and Igrain i must say are Amazing. Claire's perfomance in \\"Igraine\\" when she played Morgan pretending to be Igraine was amazing. I love Morgan's evilness. lol eww Aruther was okay. They could have picked a better actor to play him. Merlin was awesome. They could have done mroe with his character.

0880796863|5.0|I am new to Tarot,so my opinion may not be as valid as someone more used to divination.  This is of course, the familiar Rider-Waite-Smith tarot deck, and as a newcomer I find it easy to understand the symbolism. The art work I find beautiful, and the colors compliment the art beautifully. Most Rider decks come with varying colors, some more radiant, and some more muted. I believe this has the perfect coloring.  The box this comes in is simple, but nice. I actually have a tarot box that I received years ago from an aunt (she never said it was for such, but it fits the cards perfectly, and I did find out she is also a diviner) Despite having the wooden box, I actually prefer the box these cards came in.  The only negative I have to say, is I do not find The Key to the Tarot to be a great stand alone book for beginners. I bought a different book that is wonderful for beginners, and I found that The Key to the Tarot, helps add depth, but alone is a bit confusing.  Anyways, a wonderful deal! If you are a newb to tarot, buy this! Along with a secondary book.
B000001ELD|3.0|most of the songs on here are good minus when you wish upon a star, just because gene wrote some mellow tunes doesnt mean it sucks,radioactive was recorded in salt lake city utah after the love gun show, i took a tour of the studio in jr. high school and the engineer told us how passionate gene was about this song and album. it brings back alot of memories for me this was a great time to be in the kiss world when disco and all that horrible crap was out there,not the best kiss album but a good one.
B004ULNJIU|4.0|The movie was clearly made in England, nothing wrong with that. Its not as high-speed as say Crank or Transporter movies, but good story, some CSI genre thrown in as well as Stathom at his best when he fights. Its definitly worth seeing. The 2nd main cop he works with is a strange looking English actor, but he is believable and does a fine job. Every movie he does cannot be all explosions and breaking legs, although he does do fighting in this one, give the man break and he can act too.
B005LY4B0A|5.0|This is a great game. It starts out fairly easy, then the puzzles get pretty challenging. I like that you can skip a level if you have enough stars. Cute and addictive.
0765350386|5.0|I was really disappointed with A GAME OF THRONES that everyone was hyping up, so I perused around and came across MISTBORN by Brandon Sanderson.  I read some reviews and I was intrigued by the mention of the unique \\"magic system\\" he used.  So I bought it and started reading.  I was amazed at how fast I flew through this book.  It not only delivered on a very interesting and \\"Believable\\" magic system,  but the story itself was equally enthralling.  I'm now in the process of reading the next book THE WELL OF ASCENSION.  I highly recommend this book to anyone that wants to enjoy reading again, or those that are tired of the mainstream Fantasy genre and want something fresh and exciting.
B004U52VPS|5.0|This really is a GREAT family game and we love playing this. The only challenge we have is a curious 2 year old but the game is VERY age appropriate for our 7 year old. Building is just as fun as using the catapault and destroying!

B005DZMNHA|3.0|I am a huge fan of Chris Rea.  Love everything he has done over the passed decade. Imagine how much he might have done if his health was great the whole time?  But this one I have to say falls short.  The CD seems a bit aimless, the Santo DVD was OK but the girl playing he lead sounded like she had no acting experience and it was too long. The bullfighting CD was just too long and expected us to look at people's feet for far too long.  Having said this there is some very good stuff here, I am glad I bought it and await the next release. And I would love to see a show in the states.  (Lastly I did not like the songs with the cheap old sounding electronic drums, beats and pads.  For one thing there is just too much great stuff out there regarding loops and other sounds sources to have to use sounds that sound this dated and corny. Maybe being a great singer, writer and guitar player is good enough? Is there really a reason to prove you can do it all?  Use a band.)
B0050QV0RQ|5.0|Takes me back to my old school rpg based turn games on my Nintendo.  just wish the exits on the maps  were  larger for the evo.Still rates a 5.
B005G4TJUC|5.0|I really liked this movie. I own the first two on DVD and despite what a lot of people think of Michael Bay's movies, I took this for what it was: a fun movie bringing an iconic childhood toy to life. I grew up watching the cartoons and was really excited when I heard there were going to be live action movies. Now I did enjoy this movie more than the second one, not that I hated Revenge of the Fallen. I loved the action sequences and the special effects. I admit I watch them more for the actual Transformers than the human actors. I didn't care for Patrick Dempsey's character. I don't watch Grey's Anatomy so I have no attachment to him as an actor and I really didn't like Rosie Huntington-Whitley. Sorry, but she shouldn't quit her day job. Acting just isn't her thing. Other than that, I loved the movie. I'm waiting until the collector's edition is released later this year. I have to have my special features.
0440236738|4.0|I've enjoyed this book and a number of others written by Coben.  He possesses a devious  imagination in developing his characters, but can so many of them be so twisted?  If this  was the 'real world,'  I don't think I want to part of it (but, of course, his objective is  selling books). He just keeps the reader turning the pages to catch a glimpse of the next   surprise he has up his sleeve.
B0055V6EZE|5.0|\\"Let Them Talk\\" is amazing!  Bluesy!  Smoldering!  Sensual!  Sensational!  I can't stop listening to it.  Hugh Laurie does it up and does it good.  What's wild about Hugh's blues is the fun he's having as he's blowing his audience away with some of the folkiest, sexiest, smoothiest sounds.  He sure loves banging away at those keys...and I sure loves hearin' him.
B004HNTER6|1.0|Up front about dvd regional setting, but misleading about language. Only the second dvd has English subtitles. A real rip-off an a real disappointment!!!!
0525423281|5.0|I didn't think it was possible to read a book better than Anna and the French Kiss but somehow Stephanie managed. It was extremely refreshing to see a \\"sophomore\\" book that exceeds the first book. The relationship between Lola and Cricket is even sweeter than the one that developed between Anna and Etienne in the first book. They have a lot more history that comes into the book together and you can't help but push for them to be together.   I also loved that see a lot of glimpses of Anna and Etienne in this book. While I would love to read a whole series about them I recognize that it would not be a good thing. It's like when chocolate cake sounds good despite being full. You eat it and then regret it. Thus, I think another book with solely Anna and Etienne would be much the same. I must say though it was nice to see them again in this book because I always wonder what characters would be doing later on after the bulk of their story is over.   This is such a great book that I don't want to give anything in the storyline away. So I am going to leave out my own summary of the book. I give Lola and The Boy Next Door a 5/5. It is definitely one of my favorite books of 2011 and probably my absolute favorite YA romance of 2011. I highly recommend this book for anyone interested in this genre.
B000002A3T|3.0|The Division Bell was more difficult to accept for me than Momentary.  Waters stated that first album without him was a \\"fair forgery\\"...and I do agree.  Let me give you my background into the band and why my opinions differ from so many.  I never cared for anything released with Syd, but felt the band made a significant move with the release of Meddle after several failed attempts to find perfection.  Ok, ok, I liked Atom Heart Mother and Ummagumma had its intrigue which I have always admired.  However Floyd ARRIVED with the release of Dark Side, to enjoy success with Wish You Were Here and the following album Animals I could do without! The Wall is a phenomenal work of genius from the creator Roger, and ever so greatly improved by David Gilmour singing and adding the perfect chords.  All respect to Mason and Wright, although the latter had very little work on The Wall.  The Final Cut is considered to be Rogers first solo album and is an album for me I will take to the grave-I love it!  Comments appear that this final album were the b sides for The Wall.  However you feel, The Final Cut is one of the most emotional albums one can truly hear.  The Division Bell released over 10 years later, is something that will never inspire me....I loved On An Island, all respect given where its due! Although Roger had a host of below average albums like Pros and Cons, or even Radio Kaos....no one is immune to the common misstep!  I did want to ask a phenomenal question, what would the result have been between collaboration on Amused To Death and The Division Bell?!  I have gone too far in this review, now you have a better understanding of a Floyd fan for barely 20 years.
0061729078|4.0|There is nothing the pen of Huxley touches that it does not illuminate and as the record of a highly civilised, brilliantly articulate man under the influance of an astonishing drug, The Doors of Perception is a tour de force.
B0050QV0RQ|2.0|Would be fun if it wasn't so confusing and complicated. I had to start all over twice because it didn't &quot;save&quot; and the game froze up. Uninstalled.
B0058VW36U|5.0|each new box level adds a new twist 2 the game. finish the first few boxes the first day and on the 29 they added thenew boxes including toy box.
030746363X|5.0|I did the fat loss section of this book.  Have not read much else in it, I'm sure the muscle gain section is just as effective.<br />I did not see results until about week 3 but after only 1 week of being strictly on this diet I felt so amazing that I didn't want to stop.  Yes it was hard at times, especially when trying to make meals at work.  I stuck with it though, got in my rhythm and now am 30lbs lighter and excited for my wedding in 2 weeks :)<br />Whether this book's information is common knowledge or not is beside the point.  It put things in perspective for me as far as calorie counting and dieting which I had done my entire adult life.  It educated me on a lot of things and gave me a guideline to follow while not completely taking over my life with draining workouts.  Best $17 I have ever spent in my entire life.  If you are sick of the calorie counting rat race, the working out an hour a day, or the fact that you just miss those awesome foods you can't have on most diets.  get this book.  With a little discipline it will change your life.
B002DMJLTE|5.0|I don't like Armageddon. To me that movie/story/acting/etc. sucks. This movie is way better. The bluray quality is also very very cool. I was wondering one thing though when watching this movie: They built an ark-like thing so that good/valuable people can re-populate the planet. But when they did a random selection of civilians, were homosexuals included? How do gay people re-populate the earth?
B0045DO8NI|5.0|so glad I got the cd / dvd version. love Pinks music videos only bad thing was \\"Trouble\\" isn't on the dvd and it's one of my favorite videos.
B004XCUEXY|5.0|If you are a fan of Foo, rock, grunge, alternative, music, you must buy this. Very very cool. Totally worth my money. Bluray is superb.
B0057MFA42|1.0|The bluray video smokes the DVD ... no question. Problem is that the sound is out of sync with the video!  ... Very bad with earlier tracks and very obvious.   Hope they fix this asap.
B002HFWAWW|4.0|I don't like to write reviews about the movie itself. I purchase based on actors, directors, etc. I check out movie reviews from imdb if I am not sure. I only buy movies that I know I will enjoy (I enjoyed this movie but the movie feels like an 80s movie about the future). About the bluray itself: Awesome video and audio. No complaints.
B0041D843M|5.0|My doctor's nurse told me to read this book. I am on my second reading of it. It has saved my life. This isn't one of those fad diet approaches. All of the statements are backed by years of studies and research. Years ago I was a vegetarian, but ate dairy and some seafood and poultry. Then I began eating what the rest of the family ate and eventually got over-weight and sick. This book convinced me to take charge of my health. I have become a strict vegan, lost 42#, and have boundless energy. My doctor and physical therapist are amazed. Anyone who cares about what they eat MUST read this book.
B004EPYZUI|5.0|And now the bluray blew my mind again. Very artsy movie (but I say this in a very good way). Simply unbelievably awesome.
B0050QV0RQ|5.0|then this app is for you. plays smooth, and is a full 8bit style RPG with a decent story, leveling up system is nice too... plus can't beat free thanks to Amazon
B003O97W5K|5.0|I love this movie. And now I love the bluray. Totally worth buying. You gotta check out the special features too. I was laughing my ass off. You will know what I mean when you watch it yourself.
B004ZNARH4|5.0|I've been pretty excited waiting for this set for some time now.  And it hasn't been a letdown.  It really is an opportunity to \\"immerse\\" oneself in Dark Side, and re-appreciate just how fantastic the album is.  It feels fresh and exciting to me, even though I've listened to the record so many times.   The package is deluxe.  The recordings sound great on my system.  I love the live disc, but it is the third cd with the demos and unreleased mix and rarities that I was most excited about.  Listening to the early mix of the album reveals a lot of subtle, different ideas.  Richard Wright's demo for \\"Us and Them\\" is absolutely beautiful.  The demo for \\"Money\\" was a real surprise.  The track from the \\"Household Objects\\" project is also a surprise, it is a rather minimalist sort of experimental, almost ambient track.  I would have never guessed it was the Floyd, nor that it was made nearly 40 years ago.    The memorabilia in the set is beautiful and fun.  I'm really pleased with the whole package!  I hope for more of these releases for the Barrett era, Meddle and whatever else they have.
B00164CM46|5.0|I love guy ritchie movies. Some reviews said quality is not so good. I disagree. If you are a fan of Guy, buy this. Worth it.
0763644765|5.0|My 2 year old daughter really enjoys this book and asks for it often.  I love how it relates to what the doggy and kitty do -- it resonated with her.  I believe this book helped to spark interest in potty training in our house.
B000Q66JXA|5.0|The quality of this bluray is ok considering the time it was made. But the story, etc is very cool. Spoiler alert: I loved it when Merlin quoted something that Metallicans everywhere associate with Cliff Burton.
B004VMVTNU|5.0|This alarm clock works great! It has tons more features then the built-in alarm clock. I used to sleep through my other alarms, but this one forces me to get going. I love that the alarm sound can fade in a little at a time. Evo 4G
B004ZNAGNE|5.0|I gave this release 5 stars because it deserves it, but the packaging of the 5.1 mixes only being available in the uber-deluxe versions feels a bit too fiscally deliberate. (I didnt want to have my marketing dissapointment effect the rating of the music.) Certainly there are many people who enjoy the DVD 5.1 experience who are not converts to Blue Ray. So in essense those folks end up with a Blue Ray disc even though they dont need it? So, it's $100 or more to hear the cuts in 5.1? What a shame. Are there others who are dissappointed in the way this music is being bundled? So many great remasters are indluding 5.1 DVD's along with the audio CD (KING CRIMSON'S amazing series for example)
1594744769|4.0|This book is packed with original plot, characters, and creativity. Ransom Riggs is a model and talented author. I look forward to the movie.
B005ELZKWS|1.0|No words to desribe this atrocity (boring) of music! Please see my review for the first Chickenfoot because this one is basically the same.
B0018KSB5C|5.0|I recently re watched all these playing on tv in hd and thought, I must get them all for my blu ray collection. I tell you I have watched alot of blu ray movies but the sound and picture on this title is just jaw dropping. The sound is so precise and so pure. Granted I have alot of money invested into my home theater setup so that helps alot. The picture is amazing as well in 1080p and comes close to being my favorite blu ray to date right up there with the newer batman movies(still my number 1 for sound and picture quality). Overall for what I paid I can easily say this is one heck of a movie for any blu ray comic book collectors collection!
B0055SWM08|3.0|relaxing and a good game when you are bored. not as enchanted with it as the others here seem to be.
1587613379|1.0|THE ETHICAL SLUT  ... (and polyamorists generally) seem to me, to rightly see that that sex without love doesn't satisfy.  Participating in the sex act with out being willing or able to emotionally, intellectually, spiritually connect with a participant makes the act sub human, not fully engaging of the person, all prostitutes know the long-term cost of this survival technique. Polyamorists know this well, but find that connecting with only one partner unfulfilling or several partners more fulfilling. Why might this be?  Does polyamory assume that the greatest expression of love must include sex? Or that love without sex is impossible? Sadly, both of these seem to be true experience of most polyamorists.  But is it possible to be self-giving in love when there there are primary and secondaries, (polyamory). When the secondary receives a love, time and personal involvement that is secondary (i.e. not primary), not self-giving, or not as self-giving.  Perhaps the primary relationship as well receives a love that is not self-giving (but insists either that it has more love to give) than the primary relationship can receive....(do we really believe this???) Or insists that the person is not receiving enough love in the primary relationship, confirming that it is not self-giving love but self-getting love that is the driving impetus. This disappointment and frustration seems to be a common impetus experience of all or most polyamorists that I know or have read about, very understandably.  Could it be that our surface words and deeds may profess love, but mask the self-love by which they are driven. In polyamory or monogamous relationships?  According to some polyamorists ....Jealousy is the opposite of love.  I think it isn't. Hate or despising is the opposite of love.  The opposite of jealousy (with it's fear and insecurity) is contentment (with it's peace and security).  The older usage of the word jealousy...contained a much more positive element of protection and care which is completely non-existent in our modern usage of the word.... To jealously protect a person or an object was to care deeply for its value. To jealously protect a beautiful musical instrument, didn't mean that you were insecure about someone else sharing it or using it but you wouldn't leave it out in the rain or give it to someone who would mistreat it. Not because you were insecure but wanted to protect its value...i.e. treat it with respect and care.    Is it possible to have a monogamous relationship and be so secure with or committed to the relationship that to consider extra marital sexual relationships would be impractical and destructive of the relationship, (or perhaps even less pleasurable)? Impractical in the above sense, of not being able to fully give oneself to a primary and a secondary...(even self-giving in a monogamous relationship is too much for most of us consistently, we all have limited time, resources and distractions).   Who would wish another person/lover with all their insecurities, fears, insensitivities, self-centeredness, greed etc. (that come as baggage with most people) onto a deeply loved partner? Not me.  The Ethical Slut version of the goodness of multiple non-monogamous relationships seems to me to be an attempt to build a morality with out a moral base. i.e.\\" all \\"oughta-be's\\" are cultural artifacts, nature is wonderfully diverse\\"....page 11   This is saying there \\"oughta-be no oughta-be's\\"  The rest of the book is a working out of how you \\"oughta conduct your self to be a successful...loving polyamorist, an attempt to totaly denigh this main proposition. You \\"oughta\\" respect all the people involved etc .etc.etc.  All sex and pleasure is good, is another utterly false assumption. What about rape? What about the paedophile or the person who gets pleasure from torturing/ murdering other people? Or just the average person who loves and gets much pleasure from manipulating others. Or just the pleasure of eating....which leadsto over eating if the pleasure involved is elevated to the prime good,,,to obesity, heart disease, etc.etc...the examples are endless  The Ethical Slut acknowledges that if you can't handle the complexities of several relationships, jealousy, juggling, cooperating, negotiating etc. then it's not for you. This is wise advice, I'd reckon for this reason it is impractical for most of us, perhaps with the exception of the financially and time rich and perhaps the bored. For many of the above reasons I wouldn't recommend it as a thoughtful or sane option.  The ETHICAL SLUT is a shallow book, lacking any sense of cohesiveness. Perhaps a fair attempt to justify, UNETHICAL LUST. If it satisfies you why not?
B003ZSJ212|1.0|The Much awaited new Star Wars collection does not work on our LG  BD300 blu-ray player ......EVEN WITH THE LATEST FIRMWARE downloaded the same day , before  I tried to play the disc's in the collection. I tried several disc's, all the same, the screens notice comes up \\" CHECK DISK\\"  They should stop messing with new downloads and updates, and make it simple to use a Blu-ray player without constant necessary updates....and this time.....it didn't work.    Do they think I am going to spend a hundred bucks or more for the latest Blu-ray player just to play the latest Disc?
B0050QV0RQ|5.0|This game totally reminds me of Dragon Warrior for NES. Easier to work with though. This game really surprised me. The controls are smooth and quick. This is a turn based rpg. Love it!!!!!
1416550550|5.0|The Forgotten Garden is another great Kate Morton novel.  She did it again!  This novel is long, the earlier reviews commented on this, but you never get bogged down.  It is well written, the characters are well developed and it hooks you.  If you start reading this novel, you will HAVE to finish it.  The story is bittersweet, but such a great read.    The story reverts back and forth between different time periods, but she weaves it all together brilliantly.  The reviewer that claims she had to keep looking back at earlier pages to keep up; well, that reader isn't the sharpest tool in the shed.  The story is so well written that you are easily able to bounce between the time periods, or generations.    One of the main characters is a writer of fairytales and the fairytales written were so well done that I actually looked up the name of the character to check whether or not the author had really lived, whether or not these fairytales were really written in early 20th century England.    This book will take some time to read, but you will be so glad you did so.
1594202710|5.0|This is the best book I have read on foreign affairs, Chinese foreign affairs, and Chinese history.  Mr. Kissinger's coverage of Chinese history is masterful and worth the price of the book all by itself.  I have written a book summarizing history (The Super Summary of World History) and my summary of Chinese history is sophomorice compared to the condensation in On China.  Summarizing anything is difficult and summarizing something as complex as Chinese history is nearly impossible, but the author pulls it off as if it were no big deal.  It is a very big deal and Mr. Kissinger proves he is the master of many things in this book, and foreign affairs is only the start.<br /><br />The author's rendition of how President Nixon opened up China, and the progress of the relation ship since that time, is an absolute necessity to read for anyone interested in politics, history, foreign affairs, China, or the world.  How the Americans and the Chinese went from an antagonistic relationship to one of friendship, at least at the national interest level, is fascinating.  Mr. Kissinger's comments on Mao and his numerous meetings with him is equally interesting.<br /><br />On China never lags.  Not once did I lose interest in the book or any section of the book.  Mr. Kissinger's writing style is very smooth.  Not at all pedantic or overbearing.  The genius of On China is that it handles so much so easily.  After explaining thousands of years of Chinese history the book proceeds to the modern era, the opening of China by Nixon, then the transition from Mao and the cultural revolution to China's modern day leadership. All this is bundled into one very interesting story.  Mr. Kissinger's insights on the future relationship of China and the US is also critical reading.  Anyone wanting to look into the future of the world should read this book.  By the way, the book is very up to date as Mr. Kissinger carries the story right up to the present day.<br /><br />I loved the book and highly recommend it.<br /><br />AD2recommend it.<br /><br />AD2
142311339X|5.0|Like Percy meet Jason. This book delivers. Leaves you wanting the book to never end. I was unable to put down until it was over. Have reread twice waiting on the next one its that good.
B004ZNA7WY|3.0|I just purchased this CD to see if it was worth the hype before I invested in the others.  It is not.  I own high end hardware and there is no difference in the sound quality except that it has a slightly lower volume level, a negative.  If you own the previously remastered versions of the Pink Floyd studio albums, don't waste your money on these.  Even the packaging was cheap and flimsy, much inferior to the previous releases.
B0050QV0RQ|4.0|So far I am enjoying this title. The controls are a bit wierd at first but you get used to it.  Definitely a rm2k3 style clone, not a nes 8bit rpg.
B00005GA1J|5.0|I will not let you wait til the end.. this SACD is amazing! I am not a typical classical or jazz fan. I have few albums in this genre, but boy is this one a little gem! The clarity, placing, spacing and depth of the recording is unparalelled. I have this as one of my reference cd's. When people come over and have a listen they are amazed. When I then tell them that the recording is from 1959 the amazement is complete. Epic. When this is your thing.. you cannot be dissappointed. It is live and it is stunning. Just get it..take 5 and be blown away. Njoy!
1609611543|5.0|Thank you Dr. Davis!  Thanks for sharing the truth!  You are turning lives around.  Everything you put into print is worth millions.  If only you could get a good percentage of the corrupt medical industry to dispense the truth we could begin to turn this country around.  If you don't care enough about yourself to read And Understand this book, you probably deserve to be sick.
B005G4TJI4|1.0|While walking to the counter to PAY for this release, I turned it over to read what extras were included.  NONE!!!!!  Nothing!!!!  I put it right back on the shelf.  I am NOT paying full price for a bare-boned release!  The greedy corporate thugs are counting on you to buy this, only to wave something a lot more enticing in front of your eyes when sales for this dwindle!  Sick of these rip-off tactics!!! I have no sympathy for their loss of revenue from movie pirating!  If they treated their customers with respect, perhaps the problem would not be so widespread!!!
0486274268|5.0|I love this book for it's overall sketchy quality and lovely diversity of animals, from deer to elephants. There is not a whole lot explination as to how to draw the sketches but that is perfect for me since I'd rather look at a sktech and draw it. I got this book at a different place and a slightly cheaper value but it was totally worth it.

This was the most eye-opening book I had read in 30 years. I have since looked at everything differently...and Naomi's \\"take\\" on things has stood the test of time. The world just does NOT work the way we think it does.

B0053VKP8S|5.0|I bought the FiiO D3 DAC to connect my web-connected DLNA flatscreen to my stereo. Using the optical audio out from the flatscreen to the D3 and RCA L/R cable to the reciever, the unit worked right out of the box. I chose this unit because of the headroom promised by its frequency and bit rate specs. The D3 is benchmarked at .01% thd. Sound quality is excellent. Streaming music from my NAS to the receiver sounds great. I had not realized before using the D3 how much of a difference a high quality DAC could make over the stock flatscreen. Some interesting artifacts in tv shows and music recordings come out crystal clear that I had never noticed before.  The instructionss with the unit are straightforward, if brief. The unit does not support certain encoding, such as Dolby surround (because it's a stereo DAC ...). The FiiO D3 provides a hi-fidelity alternative for people wanting to connect a current flatscreen to an older stereo, getting the sound reproduction they want, without dealing with the speaker clutter that replacing the stereo with a 5.1 or 7.1 system would require.
0525423281|3.0|First off, I LOVED Anna and the French Kiss. It has a great plot, great location, great boarding school, fun characters, a great boy, but most importantly Anna is a great character. I could easily put myself into her shows even though she was in Paris.  Perkins is cute so she created a cute book that's fun to read. I was so excited about Lola and couldn't wait to get my hands on it!   However, I was disappointed with Lola and the Boy Next Door.My main problem with this book is its namesake, Lola. She is a flat out liar. She lied to her parents, her friend Lindsey, both boys in her life, and to herself. Also, I seriously love fashion and think it's fun to change your style. I just felt Lola's fashion sense is forced throughout the book. It's there to show that she's different and quirky. However, it made her appear shallow and attention-seeking.   My second problem with this books is how fixated these girls are with their boyfriends. Trust me, I LOVE romance and I married my high school sweetheart. However, we never lost sight that life exists outside of our relationship. It's healthy and normal NOT to see each other every waking moment and to have separate interests. It shows independence and security in your relationship. But, in this book it appears that to be a happy couple you can't leave each other's side. You must be around 24/7 and talk about your love interest ALL the time to EVERYONE around you. I saw glimpses of this in Anna but it was easier to overlook than it is in Lola. I didn't even like Anna and St. Clair as much in this book because they are so ridiculously stuck on each other. I just worry that this reinforces the idea that if you are girl without a boyfriend life just isn't worth it. Friendships are important things to build as a teenager and they teach you so much about relationships. Friends are all but forgotten in both Anna and Lola actually. Your boyfriend is way more important.  Also, I really liked Cricket Bell. I didn't think what he \\"did\\"to Lola was that horrible. Sure, I understand why she was hurt but the utter devastation on Lola's part was a little extreme. He is obviously a nice guy and had reasons for doing what he did. I loved that he was an inventor and had awesome taste in clothes. Sometimes I felt he was a little to good for Lola.   Overall, there are some things that I liked. I liked Cricket, Lola's dads, and Lindsey. I thought Perkins did a nice job of capturing the essence of San Francisco. I just couldn't overlook my disappointment in Lola and her relationships with Max and Cricket. She is just not a person I would want to be around. I actually hate to say this because I really like Perkins. Most likely I will read her next book and I just hope the relationships are more realistic.
B001N1DPDE|5.0|Okay first off what is everyones fascination with \\"battoning\\" like its some long lost must have survival skill, if your in the woods or more particularly surving do u really wanna be battoning your firewood into neat little stacks that take so much time and energy that by the time u get done they'll find your dead body some were with a nice neat little pile of firewood setting next to you ?? find dead wood or smaller diameter wood u can break and throw into the fire for larger logs do what ive done countless times put the end of the log into the fire and keep moving it up into the fire as it burns the log . This knife is a 1/4 inch chunk of 1095 steel  yes the same steel used in a knife costing 3 times as much  a 1/4 inch chunk of the 1095 steel is better and more practical in my opinion then a paper thin piece of some laminated almost impossiable to sharpen super steel but 1095 is not crappy steel so basically with this knife u get good quality easy to sharpen steel that u can beat up and abuse and if it fails then for under 100 bucks u can afford to buy another and as far as the handles loosening up well there is this marvelous invention called locktite ......use it on the screws before u set out to batton a couple cords of your nice neatly stacked piles of survival firewood .
0553801473|5.0|5 stars for this book.  I am a fan since day 1, read all the books twice (except the last one, I do have some life!!)<br />I felt compelled to review this because i feel that anything less than 4-5 stars is not fair.  This is a great story, and it DOES advance the plot.  In my opinion, Martin is still at the top of his game, and this continues his series with detailed and moving characters and plots.
B004UQPM4E|1.0|Purchased this disc from amazon. Order was for US region blu ray. This is a UK? region disc (has red and blue circles on packaging shows rating \\"12.\\" Never had this problem ordering from amazon. Looks like a 3rd party vendor. No exchange, only refund.

B0050QV0RQ|5.0|symphony of eternity has the feel of a classic RPG.  it has a clean character advancement system that still gives the player tons of unique combinations.  and an intuitive touch screen interface that even a fat fingered guy like myself can use without error.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|There are two SwiftKey apps out there and this is the one that worked the best for me.  They both kept telling me that each one was an upgrade for the other.  The other SwiftKey app didn't work as well for word predictibility.  This app learns from my texting and suggests the next words for the conversation - usually its right.
B005D9MUWY|4.0|Does what it says. When are we getting updates? Newer version is live on android market. How long do you delay releases on amazon?
B0042MDAL8|4.0|I am ok with this being only the Movie and no extras. Since the price was low. But it caught me off guard because I didn't notice the bottom of the product picture showing it was the movie only edition. And the description and product title did not say that. Which other Movie Only edition BluRay do say on Amazon.<br /><br />So just be aware that this is the movie only and no extras. A single BD disc with a blue front label. My 4/5 stars is a product review and not a movie review. Overall great product, great case, but -1 star for no insert and lack of product page being being more clear about \\"Movie Only\\" Edition.<br /><br />I have nothing against the movie or this fine economy edition. But a 5 star BD release would have a chapter title insert and extras of some kind.
B004ZN9J0K|5.0|Out of all the Floyd remasters , this is the one I been dying to hear, the first version and 1994 remastered version both sounded muffled and condensed, So I was hoping that this version would sound more superior,and I was not disappointed, the sound of this is excellent and crystal clear. The packaging is okay I guess, but as some other reviewers would say, that the booklet that comes with this is more lyrics than photos, however the plus on that is the lyrics are more accurate that the ones printed on the pervious releases, also I like the fact that both Syd Barrett and David Gilmour are credited for this album, alothough they never technechly recorded this album as a five piece,couple of tracks were recorded with both guitar parts form both members, all in all a superb remastering, More is next in the ears.
B003Y8YXH6|5.0|Keeping it simple: An old favorite is entirely new, and far more moving than the original. (On my high-end speakers, it's like having John sit next to me in the room.) His vocals are rich, detailed, brought forward in the mix with emotional tones the original just didn't have. - And, though I'm not a fan of Yoko, I became much more of an ADMIRER of her: with 31 years of hindsight, it's obvious just how far ahead of the pack she was with her cutting edge lyrics bearing a cutting, intimate emotional honesty.<br /><br />Now... could we possibly have the same treatment for Imagine?
B0002BO0HG|5.0|If you like rap, reggaeton or heavy rock, don´t even attempt to take this. On the contrary, if you like soft, sad, slow (VERY SLOW) songs, this is for you. Antony´s voice is certainly unusual, highly emotional, intensively spiritual. The songs are touching and beautiful and Antony is certainly a most original singer. I came to know this group with their marvelous interpretation for Mysteries of Love from the Blue Velvet movie. Since then, I´m Antony´s fan and I´ve got all his records. I wonder if someone knows him here in Chile, because I´ve asked many people and nobody hasn´t even heard of him. I also asked my local distributor and he´s told me that this group is too independent, far from the \\"main stream\\", thus making them quite exclusive. Take the risk if you belong to the slow music bunch, go ahead and get it.
B0038M2AZA|5.0|Temple Grandin shares her life struggles and amazing achievements in a straight forward way.  I have two \\"spectrum\\" people in my family and learned so much from this DVD.  I apreciate my blessings so much more since learning of Temple's struggles with life.  She is a woman who gives hope and encouragement not only to the autistic but to all of us.
B0040JHLM2|5.0|I asked my physical therapist what walk:run shoe I should get, and she noticed I was a flat footed over pronator and should limit my purchase accordingly.  I narrowed my choices down to this Brooks and NB-933, and settled for the Brooks because it was cheaper, less bulky and available in all black, which may be helpful should you wear these at work.  I took my Brooks for a 3 mile 1 hour treadmill walk, and my feet felt noticeably less fatigued even hours after my workout.  You will feel the arch support on the inner side of your foot, but the slope to the center of your foot is gradual enough as not to bite into it like I suffered while trying a 3 mile walk in Asics Evolution or Foundation shoes.    These Brooks have mesh vents along the sides of the shoe like Asics and Nike runners, so they may not be good for running in the wet and cold or a muddy trail, so I may get more rugged and sealed NB-933 for that application should I find them 50% at an end of season sale.  Brooks have these odd flaps beside most lace holes that are designed to hold the lace so tension does not travel up and down your foot.  This may take some getting used to if you are used to tightening your laces at the top and hope that tension will pull the lace tense all the way down your foot.  So basically you have to pluck the laces starting from the bottom and working your way up in order to get a really excellent firm fit - sort of like lacing ice skates.    A few tips for you online sneakers shoppers:  If you normally buy a 10 medium shoe, either get 10.5 medium or 10.0 wide on a running shoe.  If you only want a shoe to fast or power walk in, get a runner anyway, as they are constructed for similar duties while the runners are of more durable materials so they last longer. If you want something to walk short distances and stand around a lot in, then a Walking shoe will help keep your foot planted flatter so it will feel more comfortable long hours on your feet than a runner.  If you want to walk:run on a trail, not on asphalt, then you really should be looking at trail or hiking shoes, or make sure to get rugged runner like [[ASIN:B001792H5O New Balance Men's MR993 Running Shoe]].  and finally, if you are not aware of your level of pronation (severe over neutral under) - you really should find out.  some sneaker specialty shops can evaluate your level of pronation to help you narrow down your search for the shoe that not only fits best, but is healthier for you to walk:run in.
0525423281|5.0|by Linna Lee<br /><br />I was with a friend when I received Lola and the Boy Next Door by Stephanie Perkins in the mail. Last year, I recommended Anna and the French Kiss to her, and she loved it. When I ripped open the envelope and we peered down at the cover of Lola, she begged me for the book. I said No (obviously). (Actual words were: \\"HELL NO, and you're crazy if you think you're reading this book first,\\" but who's checking?)<br /><br />We ended up reading the book together until she had to leave (which was super frustrating because I read like, ten times faster).<br /><br />Lola and the Boy Next Door is the first companion novel to Anna and the French Kiss, and it has all the captivating charm of the first book. There is nothing I didn't love about this book: what Lola wears, her gay dads, her spy/detective-wannabe best friend Lindsey, the tour of San Francisco, even Lola's sometimes-addict mother who drifts in and out of her life.<br /><br />The book opens with budding fashion designer Lola's life being upended by the return of Bell twins to her neighborhood'right into the Victorian house next to hers. Their homecoming is an event Lola has been dreading ever since she had a falling out with Cricket Bell, the boy next door.<br /><br />Lola spends much of the book emotionally tailspinning from the sudden reappearance of both Cricket and her mother, but I never found it overdone or unrelateable'that's how amazing Stephanie Perkins is. If I told Lola's story to a friend, or if I met someone like Lola in person, I might think she was a drama queen. But being in her mind, reading her narration, got me so caught up in the book that her reactions seemed not only plausible, but inevitable, like what else are you gonna do in this moment? I felt for Lola pretty much every step of the way, even when it came to her rocker boyfriend Max, who's all inked arms and bad attitude, and actually very musically talented. Even though it was pretty clear from the get-go that Max isn't a great boyfriend at all (the inappropriateness of him being 22 to Lola's 16 aside), I could still see why Lola was so infatuated with Max.<br /><br />Though Lola is a complete standalone from the first book, old favorites Anna and our beloved St. Clair (swoon, swoon, SWOON) make cameos. After reading Lola, I'd have to say that personally, I related to Anna more, but Cricket is the boy I love. He's the nicest boy you'll ever meet'and probably have already met, because he's so real, too.<br /><br />Nice boys don't finish last. In fact, the nice boy gets the girl. The nice boy has a bedroom like a Rube Goldberg machine, and he invents things for you. His bedroom is also conveniently, wonderfully located directly across from yours. The nice boy is the one who makes you laugh, checks to see your reaction, and his eyes light up if you do crack a smile. Is it any wonder that Lola fell for the boy next door? About twenty pages after Cricket shows up in person, I was in love with him, too.<br /><br />Lola and the Boy Next Door is a book to stand in line for, devour in less than 24-hours, and then share with all your friends. It's not as laugh-out-loud funny as Anna'mostly because of the different narrative voice'but this is still a book that makes you smile, and you'll immediately reread it because you won't want to let these characters go.<br /><br />The next (and supposedly final, but I really hope not!) companion novel, Isla and the Happily Ever After, comes out Fall 2012.of him being 22 to Lola's 16 aside), I could still see why Lola was so infatuated with Max.

B005D0RDKW|5.0|Was up front in both Chicago and Detroit for both legs of the U.S. tour of this show.  Absolutely outstanding performances; I can't wait to wear our the Blu-ray..
B002VPEAOE|2.0|There is some beautiful writing in this novel, but it quickly became tedious for me because of the painfully slow, flat plotline and the author's habit of telling the reader what's going to happen before it happens. Which completely kills the dramatic tension of the story. Unimportant events are described in excrutiating detail, while very important events are glossed over quickly. No one likes a spoiler, but this author filled her own novel with spoilers. For example, she announces an important death or marriage or going-off-to-war before it happens, then goes on to write 30 pages on the events leading UP to the death, marriage, or war . . . when she's already told the reader exactly what's going to happen! She does this over and over again throughout the novel, which completely kills the excitement of the story. I always knew what was going to happen before it happened. This novel is full of beautiful writing and lovely phrases, and the setting is rich with detail, but the plot is so dreadfully flat and slow, I don't recommend it. Most of my book club felt the same way -- enjoyed elements of it, especially the lovely writing, but were frustrated by the slow, meandering plot and spoilers throughout.
B0058VA2U4|5.0|Awesome, awesome, awesome. This is all I can add. This new CD is just amazing. It's not the old punky Anthrax from the 90's, its the new bigger, heavier Anthrax from the 10's! I have been listening to it for a few days now and just cannot stop. There's something new and exciting around every corner. Its a whole new sound for Anthrax and I think its the best yet.
B0050QV0RQ|4.0|I have to say I love how the game looks and plays.. very retro and fun for an old rpg dog like me. I'd of given the game a 5 stars, but it has a nasty habit of crashing, entering combat after changing maps to another level of a dungeon. Ijust lost a good hours work in the fire dungeon this way. I use a Samsung Galaxy Tab 10.1.
B004ZNARH4|4.0|Couldn't wait to add this to my collection, but very disappointed in the end. Disk 4 and 5 are the same content. The concert films are repeated, where is the actual concert video? would have loved to have seen them play DSOTM in concert. Why isn't the complete concert in Brighton included? All the new content and Hi-quality renditions could easily have been released on two disks. Come on EMI we know you have more stuff, concert video, rare outtakes in your vault, dig deeper and give us what has been available on Bootlegs for years. I am ready to be immersed, but this was only a dipping.
B003Q6CUAI|5.0|This is first time I ever bought an ebook.  Delivery was instant, works beautifully. The book has lots of little options to use you don't get with a regular book, dictionary, popular bookmarks ect.  I still like a real book but this was a cheaper, instant option. Thanks
B005COO1X6|3.0|Truth be told, I prefer Stephen King movies over his books (I know, I know...) but I thought this was a pretty good short story.  Worked perfectly for keeping me entertained during my daily commute.  However, there is a ridiculous amount of spelling errors (considering its just a short story) and after the first 5, I was kind of turned off.  I'm no spelling or grammatical genius, but I do expect publishers to be.  Someone needs to go back and spell-check this...
B0055IU4GM|5.0|John Hiatt, in my opinion, just keeps getting better. I loved his last CD \\"The Open Road\\" but this one just blows me away. While I prefer the production style of his last few CD's (very \\"In the room\\") This new one, produced by Kevin Shirley (who produced my favorite Journey album, 1996's 'Trial By Fire') grabbed me from the dynamite opening track 'Damn This Town' to the closer 'Whe New York Had Her Heart Broken.' It just sounds great and Hiatt's road weary voice really hits these some home.  \\"I Love That Girl\\" has become my new all-time favorite JH track.   Kudos to all involved.
B005G4TJI4|5.0|I've been into director's commentaries and making of featurettes since they first started coming out on DVD's in the late 90's (The Matrix and Wargames come to mind for excellent commentaries).  I've found that there is diminishing returns on these.    Pretty much all the featurettes are worthless for new movies.  Actors running around in front of blue/green screens and graphic artists sitting in front of computers are pretty much all the same.  It's mostly boring stuff that might be watched once. They were cool when DVD was new and this stuff was fresh.  But now, except for the true classics (original Star Wars trilogy), aren't even worth the time to watch.  Transformers isn't going to have anything worth the time to even surf through.  I've seen the features on the first two movies deluxe sets and they weren't anything worth watching.  As for commentaries, these are sometimes very good.  But this is only true for certain directors/producers for certain types of material (Donnie Darko for instance, Zack Snider also does a good job).  Michael Bay's commentaries are generally worthless, where he just comments on how he likes some scene or how something looks totally awesome.  Really, who cares, so he liked his own movie.   Basically, this blu-ray has great picture and sound.  That's all that people on the whole really want for this release.  There isn't going to be some extended release later, so this isn't Avatar or Lord of the Rings \\"bare bones.\\"  This is the movie.    So go buy it if you like big popcorn action/sci-fi, it's a decent film, with spectacular special effects.  I strongly doubt any of the rumored future versions with special features will add much of value.  What they will have is a higher price tag.
B005ELZKWS|5.0|If you're expecting earth-changing, life defining, soul searching, restrospective...etc, forget about it. This CD, (like their debut) is nothing more than a collection of songs by people who are having a great time making music. Throw in the extra fun of a 3-D experience and you have it all!   It's entertaining...  It's rock n' roll...  And I like it!
B0002F7I9Y|5.0|This is one of the great CD's of all time. I had actually lost it, in my stack of over 100 movies and albums. However I started to play it again after playing Willie Nelson's \\"Red Headed Stranger\\" for so long that I was physically threatened by my family. And I would rate this album by Ray Charles just behind Willie Nelson's. See all my reviews, number 17, for the review on Nelson's CD.       There are 12 songs on this disc, sung by Charles and a second artist.   Rated five stars would be:   1. Here We Go Again, with Norah Jones.  3. You Don't Know Me, with Diana Knoll. Talks about love that comes and goes. \\"To you I'm just a friend   . . that's all I've ever been . . . , but you don't know me. \\"For I never knew the art of making love, though my heart ached for love for you. \\"Afraid and shy, I let my chance go by, the chance you might have loved me to.\\"   4. Sorry Seems to be the Hardest Word, with Elton John.   5. Fever, with Natalie Cole. \\"Chicks were born to give you fever (that's right) Be it Fahrenheit or Centigrade. \\"They give you fever - when you kiss them - Fever till you sizzle, what a lovely way to burn.\\"  6. Do I Ever Cross Your Mind, with Bonnie Raitt.   7. It Was a Very Good Year with Willie Nelson  8. Hey Girl, with Michael McDonald.   9. Sinner's Prayer, with B. B. King   10. Heaven Help US All, with Gladys Knight. Notes that we all need help.  Heaven help the child who never had a home  Heaven help the girl who walks the streets alone   Heaven help the roses if the bombs begin to fall  Heaven help us all  Heaven help the black man if he struggles one more day  Heaven help the white man if he turns his back away  Heaven help the man who kicks the man who has to crawl  Heaven help us all  Heaven help us all, heaven help us all  Heaven help us, Lord, hear our call when we call, yeah  Heaven help the boy who won't reach twenty-one  And heaven help the man who gave that boy a gun  Heaven help the people with their backs against the wall  Oh Lord, heavenhelp us all   11. Over The Rainbow, with Johnny Mathis.   Rated slightly behind would be:  2. Sweet Potato, with James Taylor; and   12. Crazy Love, with Van Morrison.   The title for Charles CD led me to include this album in a book review entitled: \\"Gerhard Herzberg: An Illustrious Life In Science.\\" This was the story of a scientist that just might be the greatest scientist ever. He won the Noble Prize in Chemistry in 1971. Clearly he was a genius. He also loved company (and music). As he traveled all over the world he would bring sheet music with him and look up his fellow scientists/pianist, and sing opera all night. See all my reviews, number 31, for the review on Herzberg. Note also, that Herzberg would know all there is to know about Fahrenheit or Centigrade.
B000AP04FG|1.0|Mr. and Mrs. Smith is lovely to watch.  Beautiful leads, great houses, athletic bang-bang scenes, etc. etc.  Watch the movie with earplugs.  The earplugs allow you to admire the beauty yet protect you from potential brain damage inflicted by the ... ahem ... plot.
0385344325|3.0|I was imagining Tom Cruise playing the role, thinking who was going to play Deveraux.  David Spade?  Nah, too blond.  Maybe one of those kids from \\"Toddlers and Tiaras?\\" Hmm...  At least the relative sizes would be right.  The book was okay till that scene where Reacher was jumping up and down on this couch.  After that I kind of didn't get it.  Too much?  I say not enough - the author sold out his readers to the highest bidder, and he knows it.    Reacher is at his best when he's going up against three guys, and knocks out the biggest guy first so the others know there's no help coming.  That's what I want from Jack.  I don't care too much about his sex life.  And the concept of explaining how it all began, a la the most recent Mitch Rapp book, isn't a bad one - but this book pales in comparison with American Assassin.  My biggest concern is that it's just never going to be Jack Reacher any more now that twinkle toes bought the franchise. If I made a list of the actors least likely to pull off Jack Reacher, okay maybe Pauly Shore or Urkel come out worse than Cruise, but by how much?
B0050CJNJ2|5.0|I was very excited to be finally get to listen to this new CD. I was definitely not disappoined. This CD will win as many awards as Need You Now.  This duo showed that they can still keep the hits coming.  Keep up the good work.

The author gives great instructions and I love how she has the projects labeled at different skill levels. There is something for every level. I went out and got lots of goodies to get started on making some of the sweet little things. You can't go wrong with this book!
B0034G4OXQ|5.0|Well, normally hard-headed (cannot be bothered with supernatural stories) I found this film simply enchanting - due to Director Eastwood's fine crafting, which brings together the several threads seamlessly in a manner that seems quite natural and uncontrived - and the excellent cast.  Matt Damon, who must be one of the most reliable, down to earth and watchable actors working today -and the wonderful Cecile de France, a very talented actress with a broad range, who charmed us in the delightful 'Avenue Montaigne' (aka Orchestra Seats) a few years back.  I also must confess that Cecile is one of my favourite actresses.  I have seen this movie twice so far and intend to add it to my DVD collection (or Blue-ray when I get one).

B005G4TJI4|3.0|While the Autobots are out saving the world along side the US military on a daily basis, Sam Witwicky is unemployed. But on their latest assignment to Chernobyl, Optimus Prime discovers that the US government has been keeping a big secret. Back when man first stepped foot on the moon, they uncovered the wreckage of an alien ship that came from the Autobots home planet. And as Sam soon learns, the Decepticons are on the move.<br /><br />Sam Witwicky (Shia LaBeouf) is still the same loveable geek, but now has a new girlfriend (Rosie Huntington-Whiteley). Apparently dumped by his former, Sam somehow got an even hotter girlfriend who lets his unemployed self live and mooch off of her. This seems more improbable than intelligent machines from another planet coming to Earth. Unsurprisingly, Michael bay introduces the eventual damsel-in-distress by an eye-rolling, long, spray-tanned butt shot. Several other characters return for this latest adventure: John Turturro, Josh Duhamel and Tyrese Gibson. John Turturro is again fantastic, and brings the laughs along with Alan Tudyk, who plays his assistant. I only wish the two of them had more scenes, as they made the film bearable in between the suspense and action sequences. And to show that Michael Bay isn't a complete chauvinist, the boss in charge of the Autobots and military base is played by Frances McDormand, a tough-as-nails, female leader. And brief appearances by John Malkovich and Ken Jeong are silly and surprisingly fun. Throw in Leonard Nimoy as Sentinel Prime with an all-too familiar Spock line, and this Star Trek fan was happy.<br /><br />Thankfully, the story and action scenes more than make up for the second lackluster installment in the Transformers saga. My favorite scenes were of cleverly cut shots of the original lunar landing, with computerizes cameos of John F. Kennedy, and blending the top secret mission to the dark side of the moon. The story was pretty great and easy to follow, along with the action scenes being smoother. You can actually tell who's who. It's everything a summer blockbuster should be - action-packed, fun, with plenty of surprises. Its faults were easy enough to look over in favor of new characters, a strong story, and fantastic special effects.You can actually tell who's who.

B001P9EQH8|2.0|This review is based off of this setup: iPod with audio cables (No Line Out), AKG K242 HD headphones, and of course the FiiO E5 portable amp.<br /><br />Size-wise, this thing is very cute. It's very similar in dimensions to one of those clip-on generation of ipod shuffles (was it second or third generation?). Anyhow, the size was small, a hefty portion being part of the clip-on feature. If you own a shuffle, they would compliment one another quite well, being simultaneously clipped to your person.<br /><br />The build quality was pretty solid, too, although the plastic ends on either side were questionable; while they worked fine, I doubted their longevity (though I could be wrong, maybe the white was too white, and slightly too loose for my tastes)<br /><br />Battery life is fairly decent. I didn't have to charge this during a week trip into Lebanon, though granted I listened to music sparsely while there. Sometimes I would forget to turn it off. On the airplane, I gave up trying to use it because my headphones weren't meant for planes.<br /><br />Now for actual quality- Being a very simple economy version, there is only two things you can do- a simple bass booster, and volume control. The bass booster adds a bit of a spark, maybe a dab of color to what you hear. Things feel a little more deep, possibly a little more clear. But it's not what I would call astonishing improvements.<br />I wouldn't notice at all the difference unless I was really really trying.<br />Switching back and forth between just the cans vs the amp and cans didn't help much. Granted, this was before I discovered the Line Out suggestions, but I still should have experienced some sort of gratification.<br /><br />To be honest, I was flat out disappointed in this product. I returned it and splurged for the FiiO E11, which I absolutely love. It's more expensive and larger, but boasts a better battery life, more settings and an awesome knob for adjustments.<br />I would personally skip this, and grab a Line Out (search FiiO Line Out) cable and the FiiO E11, or the E7 if you plan on using your cans with your computer too.ab a Line Out (search FiiO Line Out) cable and the FiiO E11, or the E7 if you plan on using your cans with your computer too.
B0050QV0RQ|4.0|I downloaded this game because it was free and it looked interesting. I'm so glad that I did. I started  playing and couldn't put it down. The game is old school in its styling, but that's what makes it so fun.  I actually liked  this more than inotia 3. I found it easy to use and very straight forward. I really wish I told my daughter about those when it was free. I know she would have enjoyed it.

1401924352|3.0|As another reviewer put it 'it's quite light'. I'm 27 and I thought this book had a beautiful message, so i feel a bit bad leaving it with a 3star rating. Although i loved the message and would gladly re-read it (in segments), I feel that the same message was repeated again and again throughout each chapter and i  would have preferred a bit more \\"meat\\" to the book. I seemed to get more into it when she would talk about her personal growth or the modelling moments etc, instead it seemed at times lkie it was a little bit of a \\"soap box\\" moment... Regardless of this, i would still really recommend it, because it's so positive and a lovely read :)

0719079276|5.0|Fantastic book - breaks theory down into very manageable and interesting parts. Easy to read and understand. Does a great job with application - tells you directly what Structuralists vs. Formalists vs. Marxist ACTUALLY do rather than just what they believe. Really helped me in my theory-heavy grad classes.
B005AAVFDQ|5.0|The book and everything is really good quality and each one has a limited number out of 10,000.  The re-masted CD is louder than the original, due to the \\"loudness Wars\\" I guess.  However it sounds fine to me but the waveform does look a lot different.  The book has amazing quality photos of the band and Kurt.  The disc are held at the end of the book.  The Box set front cover with the baby is printed on a transparent cell and gives the baby a depth look, similar to Animation Cells if you have ever seen one.

B005CM9DX6|2.0|Heritage sound good from a production standpoint and has moments that pique the listeners interest but ultimately the whole things just blurs together and falls flat. Opeth's lighter material with clean vocals has often proved to be some of their best but the songwriting quality on Heritage is sorely lacking. The dramatic, gothic piano opening gives way to a series of chugging and dull tracks that lack in groove and melody.   After a half dozen spins this does not appear to be a \\"gets better the more you listen to it album\\". Heritage is trying to go in some sort of vintage pseudo-prog direction and just comes off as confused and redundant.
B005G4TJI4|5.0|this was by far the best of the 3 movies. the human interaction is better and the robot battles are infinitely better. from the beginning of the movie to the end is non-stop action. this is one of the few movies i saw 2 times in the theater. once in the regular screen and once in imax 3D. it was money well spent. i would tell anyone who is thinking of buying it, to DEFINITELY buy it!

I know he enjoyed it not only because he said so, but because he keeps bringing parts of it up in conversations with friends, refers to it while we are watching baseball games and he has reccommended others to read it as well!
B00280LYIC|5.0|i love this book so so much!!this book blew my mind about how great it was. rick riordan did a great job writing the book(and all his other books too)i highly recomend this book for ages 9 through adults it is so funny adventorous exciting and it gets young reader interested in mytholagy. its a spectacular book ;)
B0030T1NAO|5.0|The blu-ray got here extremely fast and there were no problems at all. I love the show, I highly recommend it.
B003X5UFWW|5.0|I miraculously managed to convince my wife to watch Ip Man through a game of rock-paper-scissors, and at first I began to feel bad about my decision; should the movie turn out to be terrible, I'd have a heck of a time convincing my wife to watch a movie of my choosing in the future.<br /><br />At first the movie started fun, albeit a little cheesy; it really seemed like a mediocre martial-arts import movie, and I almost turned it off. However, the plotline takes a major turn delving into WWII, and turns into a moving and entertaining piece of cinema. I won't give too much away, since the surprise the plot took made me appreciate that much more, but I will state that this is a must-see piece.<br /><br />The action is incredibly well-done throughout most of the movie, aside from a few moments which weren't quite as believable. However, this really brought back a more believable aspect to martial arts while still showcasing a greater than human approach (I was getting sick of the Crouching Tiger or Matrix style of martial arts cinema at this point). The acting is well done, with the characters fitting their intentionally stereotypical roles well.<br /><br />I thoroughly enjoyed the movie; this is definitely going into my top choices for movies. My wife, who can't stand action movies, and would never watch a Bruce-Lee movie no matter how much I pleaded, enjoyed this movie. Really, this is a touching and entertaining piece to watch.
055358894X|5.0|I went into this book like I do most...without reading a review and without reading the book jacket. Coming to it, not knowing what to expect, the story and characters unfolded, engaging me completely. I was intrigued by the hints of the backstory and the history of this world. Lynch doesn't treat his readers as though they're a bit slow, needing everything spelled out and explaining all the jokes.
B001AQO3QA|5.0|I bought my copy of the Alien Anthology through Amazon.co.uk for a lot less than the US storefront. The discs are region free, so they play fine on my USA PS3. The quality of the transfer is excellent. My favorite film is the original Alien, and it looks fantastic on this blu-ray. Due to the original film quality there are some grainy shots but the digital transfer stays true to the film and there is no noticeable edge enhancement or smoothing. The colors and lighting are deep and true and lively, and the overall effect is emotionally moving in subconscious ways that the limited palate of DVD can't equal. Great job!
B002ZG994U|5.0|I just watched this movie - the plot was awesome, casting better and action nearly non-stop! The computer stunts are ok; I always prefered movies with real explosions and crashes. (IE \\"The Road Warrior\\"). But that's ok in this day & age. One of the best elements of this movie is the villan(s). Gosh, I can't stand those guys! I want to kick thier rear ends myself! If you're looking for fun, and NOT an English class project (I.E. 'character development', etc.). It's not Shakesphere, just entertaining!  Can't wait for a sequel!
B005D9MUWY|3.0|Why isn't the amazon version updating? The market version updated last week. Or am I missing something obvious? Thank you
B000077VPU|3.0|I was hoping to replace my old worn out VHS but more than half the show is not there.....Can only hope they put it out on Blu-Ray.....COMPLETE....And YES...I'll buy it a THIRD time.
B0050QV0RQ|4.0|The graphics are pretty good and the game play is fine. The dialogue and story does leave something to be desired but I enjoyed playing it. If you still enjoy playing old school games this one catches the vibe nicely.
B000VNMMR0|2.0|If I could just teach Hollywood one thing, it would be this: stop making movies about technology.  You don't get technology, and that's okay, but every time you make a movie about it, you end up looking completely clueless.  1.  You can't typically cause an explosion by \\"rerouting gas through gas pipes\\".  Those pipes are designed to hold gas under the pressure that the pumps can provide.  Therefore, they already have gas flowing through them.  This could have been easily fixed just by saying you were rerouting gas to a generator that's still under construction (and thus, the gas pipes aren't hooked up), but no... you had to do something absurd.  2.  You can't turn a cell phone into a satellite (SATCOM) phone by reconfiguring it in software.  It's completely different hardware at every level.  All you had to do was make up a top secret cellular communication system, but no... you had to choose an acronym that actually means something.  3.  Why the superfluous act of moving a keyboard from one place to another?  Does this keyboard magically do something different when you slide it across the desk?  *confused*  Just cut out those bits where they move the keyboard.  It's almost like they were trying to hide a continuity mistake.  :-)  4.  A power grid, by definition, is a grid.  All the power in the U.S. most certainly does not go through three hubs.  Not by any stretch.  Three thousand, maybe.  And transmission losses make such a design highly infeasible.  You could cause a cascade outage that would ripple across roughly a third of the country fairly easily (and this has happened before), but you wouldn't do that by clicking a few buttons and turning off chunks of the grid.  You'd probably do that by taking huge chunks of the generator capacity offline very quickly.  Either way, that's another couple of lines that should be deleted.  5.  An emergency management strategy in which banks upload all of their data *after* a serious attack has occurred is just mind-numbinglystupid.  It's like having a line in your will that says that if you were murdered, you want your executor to buy a handgun and bury you with it to protect you in case it happens again....  Delete that bit.  6.  What's with the ridiculous card readers?  You can't upload a program onto a card reader by sliding a card through it?  They're dumb devices that just read a handful of numbers off a magstripe.  It's like some graphics designer said, \\"Hey, I know.  We could draw a cube... with some numbers....\\"  It just doesn't make any sense at all.  You could have fixed this by leaving out just one or two really, really obviously wrong lines....  Replace the card reader with a smart card or similar, and this would be a little more plausible, though you probably wouldn't see anything on the screen other than \\"card accepted\\" or some such....  7.  Why was the geek so concerned about the cop making a call with his cell phone?  Your phone checks in with the cell towers every few minutes whether you make a call or not.  If they were going to track him by his cell phone, they would have already done so.  I mean, it could have been an \\"Oh, crap!  You're carrying a cell phone?\\" moment if they had written it right, but as it was, it was just a \\"Huh?\\" moment.  8.  The one spot where Bruce Willis was baffled by the geek's technobabble, that was pretty much my exact reaction.  It was gibberish.  Was that line really necessary?  9.  There is no possibility that anyone could get pinned between a van traveling at a high speed and a concrete wall and retain use of her legs.  Even if it didn't paralyze her by breaking her back and neck, and even if it didn't cause a serious concussion when her head hit the wall, the bones in her legs would have literally shattered.  Yet she was kicking the crap out of him just a few seconds afterwards.  Seriously?  10.  Jumping a car into a helicopter?  Yeah, right.  If the helicopter had been on the ground, this would have been a plausible scene.  Why the needless absurdity?  11.  Jumping on top of an airplane?  Jumping off the airplane fifty or a hundred feet to a damaged bridge, then sliding down, and walking away from it without being completely paralyzed?  Yeah, right.  Don't get me wrong, it wasn't nearly as painful as Wargames 2: The Dead Code, but it was way up there.  The overall action was good, and the plot was okay on the whole, but the technical details stank on ice.  Every five or six minutes, there was a major facepalm.
B000JMKQX0|4.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book, especially for how it handles an atypical End Of The World As We Know It (EOTWAWKI) scenario: Zombies.<br /><br />In fact, I ate it up.  I read over 300 pages via the Kindle on my rooted Nook Color in just under three settings of continuous reading.  Then... it just stopped flowing.<br /><br />The last 10% was excruciatingly hard for me to get through, particularly the last 5% where the author shifts to 1 or 2 paragraph \\"interviews\\". One was just a single sentence.  The author basically faltered after the climax and the ending was both unfulfilling and unresolved.<br /><br />Otherwise, 5/5.
B005ELZKWS|5.0|This is Real \\"Rock and Roll\\" at it's best. Sammy and Mike's vocals are better than ever and Joe's guitar playing will blow your mind.
B0000A118M|5.0|Moving music--I have listened to it many times.  Great jazz from a great artist!  I highly recommend if you love jazz!
B005KAH7QU|2.0|If I give a movie 3 stars it is because I could bear to sit through it. This movie starts out great. But the poor direction and poorly performed action scenes, once she shows up on the underside of a Humvee, were tiring along with an almost intolerable soundtrack. I was surprised at the low quality of action tolerated by the director. I believe Saoirse Ronan has the ability to perform the action scenes as well as Angelina Jolie did in SALT. That would have made this a real movie. What they saved on this garbage soundtrack could have been invested in better direction and higher quality action scenes. In fact, just leave out the soundtrack altogether. Even the phone conversations sounded acoustically raspy and unnatural, as if they were rushed.  About a third of the way thru I began to think that the director was looking for an \\"Alice in Wonderland\\" effect. The props etc.... were so poorly done. I wanted to give the director the benefit of the doubt.  I just lowered my rating. I skipped thru the movie. What a bore.
B005974CNA|5.0|First, I want to recognize all the great, thought-inducing, technical reviews here on Amazon. Amazon is a great place to share opinions.  Like many others have said this is DT's best album in years. However, I didn't really \\"get it\\" the first time or two I listened. Over the last several weeks I have grown more and more enamored with this album, this band, the songwriting, the emotion. This is the first DT album that I've felt I could share with some of my non-prog rock friends and they might actually listen to it and like it. Some will say that DT has \\"sold out\\" or is trying to go mainstream. I say so what?   If writing music that has less \\"weird stuff\\" in it sells more copies then that's not selling out that's just good business sense. If the music is still great and is played with sincerity by great musicians, well that's even better. Mike Mangini is a monster on drums (still love Portnoy tho), Jordan's keyboards are awe-inspiring, Myung does his solid best and holds down the rhythm as usual, Petrucci continues to melt the fret boards and Labrie displays the most beautiful and reserved singing of his career (a good thing by the way).  So give it more than a casual listen once or twice and you too will be a fan.
B005LY4B0A|5.0|This game runs great on epic 4g, no problems.  basic graphics but a nice change from angry birds.  as the levels progress it can become quite challenging.
B004LWZW4C|1.0|A word of warning to anyone considering purchasing to watch on a PC Bluray drive, or HTPC setup. I purchased this movie on the release date from a local retailer, took it home to watch it just to find PowerDVD 10, nor TotalMedia 5, do not support playing this disk! It was not until I paid Cyberlink AGAIN for their new PowerDVD 11 and did two updates was I able to watch what I had paid for. Upon reading reviews and doing some searches LOTS of people are having problems with the BR copy. Think twice before purchasing this poorly supported disk from Fox! You will have to budget for new software as well!
B0058VW36U|5.0|My husband recommended I get this game &amp; I'm glad I did!  This is one of the most addicting games out there.  Cute &amp; humorous and just downright fun.
B0036T31YY|2.0|Don't bother watching this one unless you are really bored.  The movie starts off good and then falls into a very tried formula and doesn't come close to a strong finish.  Skip this one.
B0041KKYGU|4.0|Number one it is supposed to be comedy.  If you went in looking for accuracy about the school system you should only blame yourself.  Secondly calling someone a moron for enjoying a movie designed to be a break from reality is a joke.  Everyone likes different movies for different reasons, I am sure if you gave me a list of your top movies I could find just as many faults and vice versa.  That being said if you like adult comedies, that are designed to make you laugh, and not on reality, its a funny movie.
B005B0QYMM|5.0|When i first saw this preview, i thought it was going to be another Paranormal Activity rip off. but i had a little hope for it being an idie film. so when i saw that it had finally got a distributer to at least put it on demand, i had to check it out. i was very happy i did and i can't wait to buy it. it isn't a rip off of anything except the concept of found footage, yes, but it is done in a much better way. the begging is a parody on all the paranormal reality shows which is a great way to lighten the mood before you are thrusted into a hell for an hour and a half. the thrills are both anticipation and also things that jump out at you. it is better acting then i expected and the effects are very well done. this is how a horror movie should be, not shocking but scary and making you feel like you are there which makes you even more scared. i rarely get scared ever, but this one had me jumping.

B004EPZ06Q|4.0|this movie isn't as good as the already comedy classic of the first. this one is more shocking and more 'huh' filled though. i enjoyed this movie so much i will buy it and watch it again inly because it made me laugh in how over extreme it actually got. not many people agree, but i figured that with a sequel that would happen. tie it a shot and you decide if you enjoy it.
B000FC1AGG|5.0|At first I wasn't very sure about this book, I downloaded just before my flight just to have some material to read on my two hour flight. Once I started I couldn't stop its funny and sooo true, who couldn't feel identified with Emma? I finished the book the same day. It gives you a new perspective of how your life can change for good in such horrible circustances. Love it!
B002VECLVO|5.0|I somehow skipped this film when it was released a few years ago and only recently, my curiosity was piqued by Firth's excellent performance in THE KING'S SPEECH. I remember reading Christopher Isherwood's BERLIN STORIES in college back in the late '80s, and I admired his writing. But I was unfamiliar with the novel of which this film is based.  Need I say, I was blown away?  Although it deals with a gay man and the loss of his partner, anyone can deeply relate to the emotions here. The palpable despair and loneliness that enfolds on the main character played by Firth is so real and compelling, it breaks any boundary one might pose in such matters as who is loving whom. I really didn't care, all I knew was I was riveted and deeply moved by the film's end. I wholly recommend for anyone who is human and on the earth.
B001MEJY8W|2.0|THE MOVIE TO ME WAS BORING.  THE IDEA OF DOING THAT TO SOMEONE FOR THEM TO REACH A CERTAIN POINT IN DEATH WAS STUPID.  I LOST INTEREST WHEN THAT GIRL WAS BEING BEAT!  ALL I CAN SAY IS THE HOSTEL MOVIES...  OH YEAH, IN SIDE OF A BEAUTIFUL HOME IN A CABINET WAS A BASEMENT AND IN THE BASEMENT WAS A SUB BASEMENT!  GET REAL!  AND PREDICTABLE. JUST VOICING MY OPINIONS LIKE EVERYBODY ELSE.  FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO SEEN THIS MOVIE MAY NOT LIKE WHAT I SAID BUT IM TELLING YOU, HOSTEL.
B004L49K20|3.0|Out of all the tracks on this album I only liked three the rest were a waste of my time.  Most of these songs were overly produced.  Don't buy this album thinking you'll get blown away by it better yet just download the ones you truly like you'll save some money.
0375842209|5.0|This novel -- about the power of books and of words -- is amazing. The author's choice of Death as the narrator was a creative decision that had great potential for ending up contrived, but Zusak makes the character wise, beleaguered, and gentle. I actually found Death comforting -- and that wasn't something I would have expected.  The author makes some very unusual word choices at times (adjectives and adverbs especially); and although the poet in me loved some of them, at other times they took me momentarily out of the story. (\\"Why did he choose that? And what does he mean, exactly?\\") But even that editorial complaint is not enough to remove even a fraction of a star in the rating. The book is beautifully written, and the plot, characterizations, and sense of place are incredibly well done.

0307586901|3.0|Martha Stewart was on a talk show dissing Rachael Ray. Martha said \\"Rachael's new cook book has repeat recipes that were already published in other books.\\"  Many of the craft projects that were in her magazine are now in this new book. Some of the projects are really nice but many of them are geared towards children. I gave the book 3 stars because of  the repeats and there are NO patterns!!!  If a particular project needs a template,clipart, etc. --- you need to go to the Martha Stewart website to download the pattern.  What is going to happen in the future when I want to do a project and the patterns are not available? I would have NEVER purchased this book-- if I knew the patterns were not included in the book.
B003ZSJ212|4.0|Now, I never really liked Star Wars. I preferred Star Trek and other stuff. I found Star Wars to be somewhat too \\"cute\\" (especially with Yoda) so I never saw anything more than the first movie. While i do understand partly why I did not adore Star wars initially it actually does have some more interest than I thought. The factthat the movies have been altered seems to be quite a sacrilege to many die-hard fan and to some degree one does notice that some of the ffects have been altered without being a connoisseur but is it really that big a deal? the movies are enjoyable even if the later produced earlier 3 episodes are less fun. On these discs there is such a lot of material that one can not really complain...even if all reviews on the site seem to be about people complaining or not about the upgrading of the movies. While it is true that from a cinematographic and historic perspective it is probably dumb to change a great classic, on theother hand the movies rea very very pleasant. theo nly real criticism is that maybe indeed the original versions should have been kept and included. Otherwise this is a very good deal. As with the Star Trek films somehow the transfers sometimes gives the movie a somewhat hard image.
B005EHNMWM|4.0|With \\"The Whole Love\\", Wilco has returned to what they do best, pairing fantastic melodies with some sonic mischief and a few surprise twists along the way.  Their previous effort, \\"Wilco (the album)\\", felt more like a Jeff Tweedy solo album.  He showed the guys the chord changes and they cranked out the songs.  But with this record, it definitely feels like they played around with the songs a bit more, and gave themselves the freedom to try some new things.  \\"I Might\\" sounds like nothing wilco has ever done.  \\"Art of Almost\\" reminds you of \\"I am Trying to Break Your HEart\\", but only in that it starts the album off with an atypical drum beat (reminiscent of the opening of Yankee Hotel Foxtrot).  Overall ,there are a few moments where Jeff and the band end up going with something traditional rather than pushing themselves.  Those moments are still satisfying, but not as satisfying as the moments where they really open it up to creative exploration.  Overall, this album should not disappoint any of their fans (although there will always be some, with each record, who tire of the band).  Personally, I like it better than their last record, and a worthy addition to the Wilco library.  At the very least, it holds a candle to their best work, even if this isn't the best they've ever done.
B003L77G6A|5.0|The Big bang Theory had remained great for all 3 seasons so it was easy to  believe that they would fail at keeping up the quality. But no, this season is even stronger than last one. One of the better episodes is the one where Penny's father comes and she wants to pretend that she is still with Leonard. That is one of the all-time greats. Also the addition of Priya as a new character is most wellcome. One will not be disappointed here.

B005G4TJUC|5.0|Let's be honest, I don't think too many thought the second Transformers movie was all that great. Even so, alot weighed on this Transformers movie to succeed...and succeed it did. Michael Bay took a different approach with Transformers: Dark of the Moon than he did with the previous two and gave us a movie that is so adrenaline filled that it'll leave you pretty tired after you watch it. The action happens pretty much in every frame. Not only that but The Transformers themselves pretty much take center stage in the film as you see them alot more in this movie.<br /><br />I personally loved the movie and love the direction that Michael Bay took with this one. It's played in a more serious tone as it should be. If serious Transformer fans don't like this movie, then- something is seriously wrong.
0385534639|5.0|I hope to God this writer can do a series or books that interrelate to one another in some way. The concept of her story was original.

B004EPYZQ2|2.0|For the second time in one year I find myself scratching my head and wondering if I saw the same film others did; those that positively RAVED the film anyway. INSIDIOUS was the first over-hyped movie that left me speechless as to just how OVERRATED (and lame) a movie could be, and that was soon followed by SUPER 8. The original teaser trailer promised something dark and sci-fi spooky in the vein of X-FILES. However the trailer didn't blow me away, nor did it make me want to see the film. When I started hearing that this film actually was a lighter film and would recall the better days of Spielberg in which childhood and adventure blended perfectly, I began to get hopeful. But within thirty-minutes of SUPER 8, I felt nothing but disappointment, and that feeling only intensified as the movie lumbered along. An immediate turn-off was the language. I don't care if kids REALLY DO talk like sailors or not, the amount of profanity, which includes one or two instances of the 'F' bomb in this film, is ridiculous and unnecessary. Add to that, the sexual humor and at least one instance of drug-abuse from one character, and you DO NOT have a family film in the best tradition of Spielberg. You have a movie that offends and will probably anger some parents who fell to the hype. Look at the PG-13 rating folks! It's there for a reason!   I have read where others have compared this to films like GOONIES and STAND BY ME. Those films had likeable, believable kids. SUPER 8's kids are irritatingly loud, irresponsible and vulgar. So why am I supposed to LIKE them? The fact is, I don't. They are examples of the WORST kind of behavior from children. I have heard this film defended for its language, because that's how kids really talk. I get it, but that doesn't mean that a film MUST adhere to that kind of realism in order to keep their audience entertained. Other films have won children and adults over alike without resorting to profanity; certainly not to the degree that SUPER 8 contains.Having kids curse in films is a bore. It's not needed.   As for the big sci-fi ALIEN elements within SUPER 8, all I can say is WOW, couldn't they have come up with something more original than that? All in all, a summer BUST for me. If you liked or loved it, fine. I didn't. If I really want my family to watch a film that blends childhood with sci-fi adventure and doesn't rely on anything offensive, I'll just put in IRON GIANT or HOOK, or a thousand other films that are better than SUPER 8.

B0058VW36U|5.0|My first review of anything - figured I'd contribute my part of what makes this system work despite this being the game least in need of it.  My wife and I are both hooked on this game - sadly it only runs on my phone so I find myself getting handed back a phone with a dead battery lately.  The game is constantly being updated and never stops being fun.  If I had to say there was one area of improvement - you seem to unlock a lot of things throughout the game, but they don't really do anything and I can't find any place to view these \\"achievements\\" to make sense of them.  A trophy room would be nice.
B003HKN52A|4.0|Elvis on Tour certainly deserved to be released on DVD, but why did they not take the time to add at least as bonus material some of the hours of footage that is available? This deserved the same treatment as That's the Way it is. Cut out the  dated interviews with fans and elderly hotel employees and give us more of Elvis. For that reason I give it only 4 stars.
0143036424|4.0|This is an interesting mystery with well drawn characters and chock full of literary references.  The sheriff's relationship with the Native Americans and the past history of  Wyoming as well as great descriptions make this book and series well worth reading.

B004P8JPS6|5.0|I keep my reviews short. This is the story about how Major Jack Reacher ended his military career.  The setting is 1997, Mississippi, and Reacher is sent undercover to a small town outside an Army base, while the Army also sends in an investigator to the Army base.  There is murder and mayhem and pretty good sexual tension.  I don't think this is the best of Lee Child's Reacher series but it is a fine read and kept me at my Kindle from beginning to end.

B0050CJNJ2|3.0|After winning five Grammys, Lady Antebellum had the gargantuan task of following one of the most successful efforts of 2010, [[ASIN:B002WIDRM6 Need You Now]]. While [[ASIN:B0050CJNJ2 Own The Night]] is solid, it does not eclipse Need You Now by any means, hence making its buzz still strong, but a bit more `down to earth' than its predecessor.  Well produced and featuring some fine, artistic moments, Own the Night never produces another \\"Need You Now\\" or \\"American Honey\\" - `it is what it is.'<br /><br />\\"We Owned the Night\\" is a capable opener, opening with mysterious organ-like pad and featuring Charles Kelley on lead vocals.  Hillary Scott is mixed in the background throughout, with Kelley never relinquishing the lead here.  The vocal harmonies are lovely as always and the cut overall proves to be one of the shining moments of the effort  First single \\"Just a Kiss\\" keeps up the momentum, though lacks the magic of Lady Antebellum's best and most distinct singles.  Regardless, the chemistry is still present between Scott and Kelley and the songwriting is solid. \\"Dancin' Away with My Heart\\" is none too shabby, if predictable. Scott and Kelley trade verses for the most part, coming together on the refrain.  The first three cuts are rock-solid.<br /><br />\\"Friday Night\\" possesses more of a pop/rock edge. While the accelerated tempo is a nice thought, the quicker pace dictates more of a disconnect to the listener than say LA's ballads. \\"When You Were Mine\\" suffers from being a bit too long, nearly clocking in at five minutes.  Despite this, there are some highlights: use of B3, ostinato-flavored piano lines, and of course those signature harmonies. \\"Cold As Stone\\" resurrects the effort as it threatens to fall flat.

B005ELZKWS|5.0|I was slightly skeptical that they could top the first album, and that one certainly is still one of my all time favorites, but this one does deliver the goods.  It is more diverse, more complex, and more of what I love about this group.  I only hope they can add at least a couple more before they move on and take their place in Rock History.
1423101502|4.0|This one hell of an action-packed series. It really stands for being the last one in the series. It does not cater to young ones alone but also to those adults who appreciate the finer things in fantasy. It will awaken your senses. Rick Riordan did very great and did not disappoint me at all in any way. A very well deserved tap on the back for Riordan for this wonderful masterpiece!

1416511946|5.0|this book was more than I've spected, it was sad, funny... sick and healthy all at the same time... for me it was such an experience to read it because I was always a fan of Motley Crue, Nikki Sixx was for me my \\"self confidence icon\\" when I was a teen.. now I realize how far from reality I was and not only that,,, Nikki really show us the readers that to see the appearance of a person is not enough to really know what's inside, he suffered a lot and put himself in to real terrible experiences, at the end he made me understand that we must accept our fate and make efforts to improve our lives every day.  Good graphics and pictures also, the design is unique and gets conected with every single situation, I definelly feel closer to Nikki (who is someone that I've admired almost all my life)and I thank him for letting me know more about his life.

B004ZNARH4|3.0|INCOMPLETE BOXSET OF DARKSIDE OF THE MOON.  IT SHOULD INCLUDE ECLIPSED.  Back in the day whan it was a vibrant, innovative band, a Pink Floyd concert would consist of a first set of all new material that had not been recorded yet and a second set of older material.  In the first set of Pink Floyd concert, the band would play and experiment with new material before committing it to vinyl in the studio.  During the 1971-2 concert tours, the first set of a Pink Floyd concert consisted of a suite of music called Eclipsed.  It was mostly what would become Dark Side of the Moon.  At that time, it wasn't complete and did not include some compositions, such as Great Gig in the Sky.  But, it had other, different musical interludes.  They do include some of the interludes from the live recordings in 1972, but I think they should have included the complete suite.  Anyway, to make this a complete boxset, a CD of Eclipse should have been included.  If they didn't have a recording of one those concerts, then they should have done what Frank Zappa has done.  There are many bootlegs out there that contain Eclipsed and some with very good sound (better than many legimate live albums that released today, like the recent Black Crowes Warpaint Live).  Frank Zappa went out and got bootleg recordings of his old concerts and released them on CD, thus collecting the money he deserved in the first place.  What is included is a fantastic live version from the 1974-5 tour of Dark Side of the Moon which is nearly an hour long.  It is soooo much better than the live version that the band did on the 1994-5 tour and is included in the album Pulse.  Note that during this 1974-5 tour, the first set of the concert included \\"Ravin' and Droolin'\\" which would become Sheep and \\"You've Got to Be Crazy\\" which would become Dogs, plus Shine on You Crazy Diamond, and added later in the tour Have a Cigar, all before either Wish You Were Here or Animals were released.  The encore was Echoes played in a \\"snow storm\\".
B002FGU4D0|4.0|I bought these sandals as a replacement for a 6 year old pair of Tevas. The old pair's sole began to delaminate after 3 years and I glued the soles back on twice, I was not going to do that a third time. These new Teva Terra Fi 3 sandals have fewer separate pieces that make up the sole so I'm hoping that change in construction results in a longer life and fewer delaminations. I've worn them for about a month and so far so good. At first the \\"Shoe Pad\\" heel cushion bothered me a little because it was raised above the foot bed but now it has conformed to the shape of my heel and the sandals are very comfortable to wear for extended periods. They are also designed with more arch support than the old pair which is a plus for my feet. At only one month's use I can't speak to the durability but I do find them to be a good value in comfort and design.
B0041EVYVK|5.0|I very much enjoy this work - the band is tight, the guitar work is first rate, the drummer is terrific and the female vocalist knows what she is doing.

1609611543|5.0|I commend Dr. Davis for writing this courageous and much needed book. After living for 15 years in pain, discomfort, and immune weakness, with a Fibromyalgia diagnosis, I spent the last three years wheat, gluten, and dairy free, and now have, what I believe to be perfect health.  One of the hardest things in life is to watch people around you suffer in pain, and to know the answer to alleviate this pain, but to be unable to influence their behavior.  Getting well, allowed me to follow my dreams of graduate studies in Behavioral Neuroscience.  Dr. Davis's book has given me the courage to explore a thesis in the effects of wheat and gluten on neurological processes including addiction, cognition, and affective (emotional) disorders.  As far as I can tell, there is some research in this field, but much of it is not in the US, and much of it stops around the time of the early 90's when the US declared the new food pyramid with grains as the primary source of calories, at the bottom of the pyramid. I'm tired of watching my loved ones suffer from disease and pain, and I'm tired of witnessing the health and economic crises in this country, and I've decided that I can make a difference. Unfortunately some will continue to suffer while I work on this, and I have to learn to accept that.  This will be a revolution, simply through an exponential growth of people transforming their own lives from pain and disease to health.  The free market will respond, but only if we can get the message out above the government and corporate run organizations that are silencing the truth.  Please talk about this book with your loved ones.  If you read it, you won't be able to help talking about it, and you will surely get some negative responses, but know that you are changing the world one step at a time.  I've found for every 5 sets of deaf ears, I get 1 person who lights up with interest. This is all that it takes.

1596912863|1.0|*** Warning: This review contains spoilers! ***<br /><br />This book is not for Jane Austen fans. Jane Austen was a master of dialogue, of showing rather than telling the reader what was going on. The relationships of her characters, the events they experienced, were engaging, meaningful, and sometimes surprising. In this book, however, the writing was uneven and poorly worded (I sometimes had to re-read sentences just to figure out what they were trying to say!), the plot development loose and predictable, and the dialogue actually cringe-worthy. If anything, Austenland is written for young, hip fans of Colin Firth as Mr. Darcy in the BBC adaptation of Pride and Prejudice.<br /><br />Austenland's main character is named Jane. Really. It's a bit much, right? And she is nothing like the main characters in Jane Austen's novels, though she flatters herself by comparing herself to them. Elizabeth Bennett was witty and clever, Emma Woodhouse was charming and poised, Fanny Price was self-aware and principled - and none of them needed a man. Even though these characters were surrounded by women who wanted nothing more than to find a suitable husband, they themselves were strong and independent, and they found love and marriage despite the fact that they didn't go looking for it. Jane Hayes, on the other hand, was co-dependent and desperate to find a man. She was the complete opposite of a Jane Austen heroine. Instead of sympathizing with her, I started to side with her ex-boyfriends. Who would want to marry her!? When two guys fell for her at Pembrook Park, I honestly couldn't figure out why. What was so great about her?<br /><br />Jane Austen's novels gave me a beautiful and charming impression of Regency England, but the \\"Austenland\\" described in this book didn't sound remotely interesting to me. Do such places really exist? If so, I hope they plan their retreats better than Mrs. Wattlesbrook did. With a one-to-one ratio of men to women, only three clients in one location at a time, and a lecherous drunk hanging around, the place sounded pathetic, boring, and even a bit creepy.<br /><br />The book almost redeemed itself with a solid ending when Jane walked away from Mr. Nobley and Martin with her head held high. THAT was a perfect ending, in which Jane learns that she is a smart, confident woman whose self-worth is NOT dependent on having a man. Unfortunately, it all got thrown out the window when the book continued on to its actual ending. Jane DOES need a man after all, and even though she hadn't really felt attracted to this man before, she would throw herself at him just as she had thrown herself at Martin less than three weeks previously. And based on the Jane I met in this book, my money is on the relationship crashing and burning within a month of the plane's landing.drunk hanging around, the place sounded pathetic, boring, and even a bit creepy.

0385344325|5.0|Fans of Lee Child/Jack Reacher will love this book, and new readers couldn't have a better place to start. I first discovered Jack Reacher late in the series with 61 Hours, and I liked it so much I went back and read every book in order (the publisher helpfully numbers them on Kindle so you don't have to guess). As a West Point grad and former Army Ranger, I'm impressed with Lee Child's insights into the military and his character development. As a reader, I'm always impressed with his smooth writing style and fast paced stories.<br /><br />The Affair is a finely woven story full of intrigue, set in a small town outside of a remote Mississippi Army post. Reacher is sent into town undercover to keep tabs on a murder investigation, and quickly meets the gorgeous chief of police. This is familiar to Lee Child fans, but once again, he pulls it off flawlessly. It's also the second Jack Reacher novel written in first person, and reminded me of Brian Haig's protagonist Sean Drummond- also an Army major sent in to investigate various crimes- although Reacher is less of a smart-ass and much more likely to bang heads and break legs along the way. (If you're a Lee Child fan and haven't read Brian Haig, you should!).<br /><br />Throughout the book, Lee Child does a fantastic job keeping the suspense going. Several times when it seems everything is almost wrapped up, Reacher keeps pulling at threads until another revelation appears. It's not as action packed as some Reacher novels, but it's definitely one of the best.<br /><br />Having read every other Reacher novel, I was also very impressed with the way the author casually intertwines elements that fit in later books. For example, Reacher tries calling his brother, who is on assignment in Georgia- which folds neatly into the plot of The Killing Floor (book #1 in the series). He also obliquely introduces Leon Garber and Francis Neagley, characters who are prominent in later books.<br /><br />If you're already a Lee Child/Jack Reacher fan, you'll love this book. If you haven't read Lee Child yet, The Affair is a perfect place to start. Just be prepared to get hooked!ou haven't read Lee Child yet, The Affair is a perfect place to start.

B004J4WKTW|4.0|The story is of a competition between the magicians who fall in love with one another against great odds.  The competition takes place in an incredible circus. The book is very descriptive and the circus is so easily visualized, so magical and easy to fall in love with (as easy as dreaming of going to Hogwarts).  You can imagine being in the tents, the \\"planners\\" house for his parties and even Baileys tree.  You wish you could actually see the clock in the front of the circus.  I found the scenes so well described that you almost forget that the main characters (the magicians) are more 2 dimensional.  I didn't really like Marco(in fact I found him a little annoying) and Celia was ok.  It is odd how the circus could be so believable but feel like you didn't really know the main characters, almost like props to the circus.  There were other characters that I felt I knew better and liked: Bailey, the Clock Maker, the tarot card reader and the twins.  The book was worth reading.

B003O85W44|5.0|My God, the production on this album is amazing! You need to sit down and listen to this record to fully appreciate it. It's mind-blowing how many things are going on that are all tucked into the mix in endless places. These details get lost during passive, background listening. It is sonically so appealing it tends to pull you in. I love how all the instruments sound on this record! And the songwriting is just stellar. Devestatingly melancholy. Very dark. But real. These songs all tap into really specific emotions that are hard to describe but you know when you feel them. I mean this album really is a masterpiece. I didn't understand why it was getting so much praise initially. Like some others, I thought it was rather boring the first couple of listens. But I've had that happen many times with phenominal recordings. It's like they're too brilliant or deeply emotional that my brain just doesn't register it at first. But truly \\"The Suburbs\\" is a fantastic journey. It's bleak, but it's full of life at the same time.

B002TZS5GU|1.0|ALERT - MOVIE SPOILERS BELOW  What a bunch of unlikeable characters!!  Brian is a selfish jerk who steals a vehicle from a father trying to save his infected daughter leaving them later to die.  The father should have made the little girl potty right there by the car (blocking her from sight as much as possible) because HE KNEW they would drive away abandoning them if he left the car to take his daughter to the bathroom.  And, for a man concerned with saving his own life, Brain recklessly risks his life by wasting bullets which would be needed later and goofing off tipping over a golf cart/falling out and later almost falling off a pool diving board into infected water.  Bobbie, Brian's girlfriend, is compassionate and wants to help the little girl and her father.  She convinces Brian and the others to take them using plastic clear wrap or something to separate their seat from the others.  The father/daughter needed gas and used their car to block the road so when Brian's car came by, they would trade for gas for water.  Instead, Brian leaves them but returns after his oil pan leaks.  They use Brian's gas and the father/daughter SUV.  Bobbie later tries to help the girl when she is choking and the girl spit up on her giving Bobbie the disease.  The brother and his friend Kate convince Brian to abandon Bobbie like they did the father/daughter earlier.  Danny was supposed to the be compassionate brother compared to Brian but that was a lie.  They BOTH deliberately left their parents to die.  Danny also didn't stop Brian from driving away leaving the father/daughter and bother Danny and his friend Kate - another loser - convince Brian to dump Bobby.  He lies constantly to screw others over.  I can only HOPE that the starving dog that bit Danny when he broke into a farm house gave him rabies or that sickness because the dog was eating an infected body.  Danny tries to steal Brian's gun when Brian is running an infection from the bullet wound.  Danny and his friend Katesteal the gun, shoot Brian and abandon him.  I don't know why Danny got upset when his brother shots two women when he is as bad as his brother is.  Kate - a real loser.  Selfish to the core.  She is despicable and I hoped throughout the film she would get sick or hurt and die.  There is still hope she got sick from sitting next to Bobbie or gets sick from Danny who got splashed with infected dog blood and bit by that same dog that was eating infected bodies.  Ironically, after Brian/Kate/Danny steal the father/daughter car and abandon them and then later dump Bobbie, they need gas.  Brian cuts off the road from the 2 women driving in a car just like a desperate father did earlier to them.  The two women say no and Danny lies and says he is Christian and that his wife (no wife) is pregnant trying to convince them to stop when they were going to STEAL the gas or the car or both and abandon both women.  When the 2 women try to drive away, Brian shoots the driver dead.  It was GREAT when the passenger SHOOTS Brian in the kneecap before he shoots her.  Then Kate steals their gas and they leave them there to suffer and die slowly if they weren't dead already.  The disease can't be too infectious because they remove the keys from an ignition with a dead guy behind the wheel and the keys didn't infect them.  They sat next to Bobbie in the car for days when she was infected and didn't get infected.  Danny takes a rifle from an infected man's hands (in 2nd story of house) and didn't get infected.  But there is still hope that Danny and Kate still die.  Hopefully, they will.

OK just played the Blue Ray disc.  Love the documentary.  A bit disappointed in my own anticipation interpretation of what the \\"Concert Screen Films\\" from the various tours were:  literally the screen, projected behind the band.

I enjoyed the author's ability to make me feel the hunger...the fear...the angst, etc. that I felt for the characters. Definitely not for just the YA group. I didn't want it to end and once it did, I felt empty...just for a second...and then I proceeded to \\"whispernet\\" the next one straight to my Kindle.
0920668372|5.0|such a heartwarming story of love and care transferred from one generation to the next and so appropriately described as \\"I'LL LOVE YOU, FOREVER!
B0051Y8OEE|5.0|This episode is very good.  It is also very sad though.  It made me cry at the end.  It really shows how strong Dean is and because of that, he thinks he has to save everyone and take the weight of the world on his shoulders so that everyone else can be happy.  I already love Dean, but this just makes him all the more likable and you feel so sorry for him.  It made me want to give him a hug and say it's all gonna be ok, even though you know it's probably not.
B004EPYZUI|5.0|This movie has become one of my favorites. Once you get over the fact that the main character looks like a 12 year old you can get into the highly original script. It takes some understanding to know whats going on in the film but if you can figure it out it is very entertaining. All the action scenes are very well done and the story is very meaningful and complex with an empowering message.
B00466HN86|5.0|This movie is amazing.  Never before have I been brought to tears during the first few moments of a film!  So many themes were woven into 2 hours of film:  fatherhood, forgiveness, courtship, parenting, obedience, trust, despair/hope, love, strength, and of course COURAGE!  The Kendrick brothers will take you on a ride of emotions....I laughed so hard, I cried.  Then I cried so hard again.  I did feel exhausted upon leaving the theater, but in a fresh, encouraged way.  Wether you are a father, mother, young person or older person, you will be moved and motivated to spend your time on earth here with purpose!  Don't forget to bring the tissues!
B004EPZ070|5.0|I thought this was a very cute chick  flick and would watch it again. This had a good story line and a good ending
B0036TGSIK|2.0|I personally wouldn't recommend this film. Don't get me wrong, it started off alright, but halfway through it started getting bad, not better, and then ended up horribly. I don't understand these 5 star reviews, I honestly don't. The acting was good, but the script was terrible. And the ending just blew.
B000025RX4|5.0|This is a great Blues Rock album, featuring the blistering guitars of Johnny Winter and Rick Derringer. This album, Winter's first, is more experimental and rocking then many of his later blues oriented recordings. Winter was a pioneer of the blues rock genre. I had this album years ago and lost it, so glad to be able to listen to it again.
B005G4TJI4|1.0|Transformers 3 is seriously a terrible terrible movie. yeah wow cool, special effects that i have seen time and time again, ridiculously long battle scenes that are so incredibly boring they literally make me fall asleep EVERY time i watch them, Terrible story, terrible plot, terrible rendition of classic characters. Why I even gave this movie a third chance is beyond me.
B0053Q9DHW|5.0|This adaptation of Jane Eyre has it all: intriguing and engaging characters, beautiful scenery, and a nice balance between the gothic and the romantic.  I love the use of flashbacks to incorporate so much of the original work.  I read the unabridged version of the book earlier this year and can appreciate how difficult is must have been to determine what to include: well done!  Fassbender is now my favorite Rochester.  He did a marvelous job of creating a character who moved from domineering and commanding master to engaging lover to heart-wrenching victim of circumstance.  I do agree with another reviewer that I would have liked to see more development in Jane: from downtrodden girl to confident young woman.  However,I appreciated the more gentle treatment of Bertha in this adaptation.  Check out The Wide Sargasso Sea by Jean Rhys for another treatment of her story.  Altogether a delightfully satisfying film!
B004EPZ00W|5.0|Other reviews have described this movie very well. I just wanted to give it five stars too as an excellent portrayal of a true story! The young lady who plays the main character's daughter is amazing in her own right.
B002I0J5FG|5.0|Absolutely fantastic games. I originally bought this collection because I wanted to see the preview of The last guardian and the developer interviews. Then I was just going to sell it. After playing through Ico again for the second time since its original release, theres no way I can sell it. Its even better than I remember it. Its truely unlike anything out there. Very meditative and intense at the same time. The artwork is beautiful. The soundtrack is great. Im partial to Ico but Shadows is just as good. Buy it! Rent it! Borrow it! Just play it. Dont forget to get The last Gaurdian when it comes out....  I also recommend Flower and soon to be released Journey!!
B005D9MUWY|4.0|great keyboard replacement for native keyboard. need to add the voice dictation option and it would be a perfect keyboard.
B002ZG994U|5.0|This movie is the best movie EVER. If you love action then this is a movie for you. I LOVE THIS MOVIE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B0052UZIFA|5.0|One great app I am thankful that I may now get my zombie fix on the go. Flower power baby.
B000YJ54DU|2.0|Wow, Lee Child really did put me down this time. After what? 11 books of Jack Reacher which were all good, by the way, and now this? The thrill is gone, it's like a very lame story repeating over and over again. I can't seem to imagine how I got through finishing the book because I am having a headache reading it and the thought that I paid for it big time!
B0058VW36U|5.0|So much fun. My 5 year old loves it and I love it too. Lots and lots of levels. Thanks!
B001NLL8LA|4.0|I must say the previous Jack Reacher novel had been a big disappointment for me. This one made it sure that it is far more better and the action smarter. A very good comeback. The plot is very fast paced and all the concepts of mystery and thriller are incorporated to create one big kaboom! Read this for you to erase the memories of the other book from Lee Child in this series.
B005E7AOHI|3.0|Green Naugahyde is the first full length album by Primus in over 10 years. It's a decent album but I was expecting a much bigger comeback. It could have been so much more after 10 years of no new material. There are a few good tracks but you are not going to hear the heavy funky riffs from earlier albums such as Sailing the Seas of Cheese or Frizzlefry. There are no intense bass solos from songs like Tommy the Cat, Jerry Was A Racecar Driver, or My Name is Mud. Green Naugahyde sounds like a combination of the Brown Album and Les Claypool's side bands. It is on par with Antipop and the Brown Album but doesn't hold a candle to their earlier albums. As a whole it sounds like Primus without the energy and complicated bass lines. I believe Les Claypool is getting too old to have the eccentricity and creativity he used to have. The best track is Hennepin Crawler. Tragedy's a Comin is also an OK song which is highly similar to Ballad of Bodacious off of Antipop. Lee Van Cleef starts out with a nice bass riff but drags on for too long and loses it's potential. If the band put more effort into this album and gave it a heavier sound with more solos it could have been much better. If you are new to Primus stay away from this and check out the other albums I mentioned. If they do make another album I hope they put more effort into it and until then I will stick with their older music.
B003ZGMFGI|5.0|If OMD were a group just starting out every pop radio station in the Western Worlrd would play every track over and over again. Strong lyric (a little cynical at times). The music sticks in your head, you can listen over and over, addictive.   Live the band are magical [[ASIN:B001FBSLJ0 Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark: Live Architecture and Morality and More]] or Live in Berlin) The real event is better. I saw them with Villa Nah and bought their CD  [[ASIN:B00362DRXG Origin]] .  I also bought [[ASIN:B004773DTW Blanc Burn]] and [[ASIN:B004EPXK7C Credo]] (they are still very much in the eighties).   I have always described OMD as Alternative, the Electricity DVD shows that they can fit very well into a classical mainstream role. In Liverpool they were enchanting, I was mesmerised. When they supported Simple Minds they were the highlight of the event.  They were also the highlight of the Worlds Fair event in Liverpool which also featured the Scaffold.  History of Modern is brilliant, not everyone will love it but there is something for everyone in there.  If you want the groups history I recommend the DVD Souvenir. This box set is a limited edition originally 15000 copies (5000 UK, 5000 Europe, 5000 US).  Anyone buying this is getting a treat
B00000IREA|1.0|We males will watch any appalling piece of crap if it's got beautiful naked women in it, won't we?  The \\"sets,\\" the costumes, the acting, the special effects, the music, the editing, the story, the sound and the camerawork here are all way, waaay below sub-standard -- but Fonda looks great, doesn't she?<br /><br />I thought I remembered this flick as a total waste of good female flesh... and yep it totally is.<br /><br />But it has Anita Pallenberg (Keith Richard's girlfriend) as the evil Queen and Marcel Marceau in a speaking role so hey.
B005ELZKWS|5.0|In one word ...............killer !!  great cd . Well written. fun songs, good times !! These guys no how to rock. Should not be a surprise.
B000255LIY|2.0|These are amazing actors. Unfortunately, it makes my disappointment that much worse. Glenn Close is no Katherine Hepburn, but she's wonderful in her own right.  Had she gone after this role in her own way (rather than attempting to conjure Kate), Lion2 could have been slightly more successful. I kept waiting to see the haughty and diabolical Marquise Isabelle de Merteuil [Dangerous Liaisons], but she never showed up.  Heck, Patty Hewes from Damages would've made a fabulous Eleanore, too (although Patricia wouldn't exist for a few more years).  Patrick Stewart should've killed this; he's perfect for the role. But at least he attempted a different flavor of Henry. Instead of O'Toole's cantankerous bluster, Stewart's Henry was infinitely more weary. There didn't seem to be a shred of victory left in him. An interesting choice. His delivery of the Lear comparison and 'deciding which peasant gets a cow' forces us to change our view of the salty old king. Not as much fun to watch, but I suppose that was the point. Notable: Rafe Spall (son of wonderful character actor Timothy Spall) has his father's fearless approach to being revolting. His version of loathsome Prince John actually left Nigel Terry in the dust.  Spall single-highhandedly kept this from being a 1-star review.  Also, Jonathan Rhys Meyers was a delicious young Philip.  Nothing will compare to the original 1968 Lion. But if you like historical costume dramas and it's a rainy Sunday afternoon, this will do.
B000V5SIFS|5.0|I remember watching this when I was 13, and was completely blown away by it! This is around the time when I was emotionally maturing, and was studying world war 2 in school. The similarities where apparent to me even then. I won't go into too much detail as to not ruin it for those who have not seen it. But like a previous reviewer said: \\" if you only watch one ds9 episode, this is it!\\" I would argue that even non trek fans would enjoy watching this episode.  Very well acted, highly emotional, poignant and relevant. I can't wait for the dominion story arc to begin! Oh joy! lol
B005OCFHHK|4.0|I was wondering why everyone says that this one does not have any bonus features. The image of the back of the case shows that there are bonus features available for each movie, including additional scenes. So, do you mean to say there will another edition with still more bonus features coming up? I for one am thinking of buying this edition, since it might take longer for an ultimate edition to come out, and i am not sure what additional bonus features that might include.
B002BWQ6H6|5.0|I am in love with the way Colum McCann uses words--magical, powerful, rhythmic, and unique. The way he weaves together the storylines and brings 1970s NYC to life is masterful. I was terribly sad when I reached the end.
B004K4AVAG|5.0|I really liked this album. I love Lady GaGa'singing. I think her voice is totally awesome. She has a lot of her hits in  this CD. Which I like. Can't go wrong with this CD. I've bought lots of CD's from Amazon and I've been very pleased with  everything I've gotten. Thanks Amazon. Keep up the good work.
B000PMLFRA|1.0|I will not purchase any Star Wars product until Lucas provides the original three movies - with a quality transfer - in blu ray.  And by original, I mean the original version that I watched in theaters 30+ years ago.
B0050R0YB8|5.0|I've built mine and I love it like crazy. It's definitely not for kids or even really playing with, but it's second to none for the adult who wants a grand centerpiece for their Star Wars collection.   I have to disagree with the first reviewer who said it didn't look right. I've seen the movies countless times and I also have various models of the same ship and it looks fantastic. This bears repeating since it's obviously the set's best quality, when the ship is completed and sitting on the table in front of you it is truly HUGE!   Building it varied from fun to tedious to frustrating, but this may be because it's the first Lego set I've put together. The instruction manual, which was pretty easy to follow, is bigger than many coffee table books and is impressive in it's own right. I'd say it took a total of 16 hours to complete. There's a feeling of pride and childlike giddiness that comes when you stand looking at the finished product. I've got a friend who has the huge $500 Lego Millennium Falcon and both Death Stars and he's quite jealous of it.   I have to mention that my experience with Lego customer service has been nothing less than the best I've had with any company recently. My set was missing a few pieces and the guy on the phone apologized profusely and offered me a free figure of any character they made. So I asked if they had Emperor Palpatine shooting lightning out of his hands. The guy said it would be no problem even though it's apparently from a set they're not producing anymore, so they sent it to me straight from the factory in Denmark. On top of that he doubled the Lego VIP points I received with my purchase from 400 to 800 and I was able to buy my little cousin a video game from their website.  Overall it was a great experience all around. If you are a passionate Star Wars collector or even just a hardcore fan who wants something amazing you can show off to your friends, this is absolutely worth it if you can afford it. I'm happy to give it myhighest recommendation!
0553382179|5.0|I was in desperate need of help. As a SAHM (stay at home mom), part of my job is to keep a clean house. I just couldn't do it, The Fly Lady website was to busy and overwhelming for me. But all the moms I know, swear by her. So, I bought her book. It has changed my life. My house is clean, for the first time in years!  I have even dusted my kitchen cabinents! I NEVER imagined I could do it, but her philosophy works!
B005EXA8LY|5.0|This applies to the Blu-Ray version only.  On the the \\"Bonus\\" section of the menu there are only the 2 additional songs. Where is the rest?   From Steven Wilson's FB page:  \\"Folks - for people saying there are no videos on the blu-ray, please note that it doesn't automatically show the videos on a straightforward playback of the album. But if you go to the track listing first and select individual tracks in that way, you will be given a number of options depending on which song; play video, listen to demo version, photo gallery, see lyrics..etc... Sorry for the confusion.\\"  Having had that cleared, I must say that the sound of the 5.1 Blu-Ray is phenomenal; I had never heard anything like it before. The production is magnificent and Steven made excellent use of the technology. It will be hard to listen to music in stereo from now on. Highly recommended.
B004LWZW4C|3.0|i bought this on pre-order and it came 7 days after it was released...  might as well gone to best buy and got it sooner.  The movie itself is ok..  not as good as the original xmen movie.. but better than 2 & 3.  havent messed with the digital copy yet.. but i plan on putting that on my ipad.  overall.. its just a dvd that u will watch a few times and then it will collect dust.
B005R9PATA|5.0|Unbelieveably FANTASTIC! I LOVE it! season 7 is looking amazing.  Jared Padalecki does an amazing job of portraying some one going through this type of trauma with the flash backs and hallucinations! people do go through this kind of thing with PTSD (minus the supernatural effects) and it is so well done.  The new monsters are scary as hell too! nothing seems to hurt them so it will be interesting to see how that plays out! i can't wait for more :)
B0058VW36U|5.0|Cutting the line from angry birds to this. Love it. Kids love it. I will play this before angry birds.
1118026470|5.0|This book improves on what I already thought was the best book on the subject.<br /><br />The advantage of this book (and now the new version even more so) is in the way it breaks down the topics. Many books sort of jump around with their various sections, while the WAHH takes the precise line that I think is best when building on one's understanding of this topic.<br /><br />The updated material is significant, and definitely worth the re-purchase. I bought both the dead-tree and the Kindle version.<br /><br />100% definitely recommended.
B005KAH7QU|5.0|I just saw this movie, it's worth seeing maybe even owning. It's a revenge movie on one hand, a action film on the other, and a fable all on in one.
B005DVIPJY|3.0|I was really expecting a blow out movie when I bought the blu ray, but I was really dissappointed.  the special effects are really simple looking, and the story all together was just bland.
B005G4TJI4|3.0|The movie starts out a bit slow but concludes well.  Not a big fan of the new girlfriend.  The movie comes with a $10 coupon to entice you to buy the 3d version when it comes out.<br /><br />I didn't see it in theaters so I was hoping for a bit better of a movie and 3D would have made it better for a first time viewing.
B005IY3DP2|5.0|I'm always worried when one of my favourite bands knocks out a new album. Looking at other frontline UK indie bands of recent years, The Enemy's first release was mint, as were the debut offerings from Pigeon Detectives and The Twang. Their follow-ups however were universally disappointing and even The Courteener's Falcon took some listening to before their \\"evolution\\" won me over. Kasabian on the other hand can seem to do no wrong and go from strength to strength with each new release. They seem to have the perfect balance of maintaining their established sound whilst evolving the music enough to make it sound fresh. Velociraptor is a strong contender for album of the year with only the Arctic's, \\"Suck it and See\\" threatening for that crown. No need to deconstruct the whole thing track by track; just crank it up and be blown away.
B005G4TJI4|5.0|The first Transformers movie was as good as it gets, or so we thought as the audience, the second was pretty good but still was missing something. Then came Dark Of The Moon. This movies special effects and story line says it all and is leaving the audience saying well whats next. SPOILER ALERT, well since Megatron, Starscream, and Sentinel are all dead wats next. I don't know what the studio is planning on coming up with but a BILLION dollars richer may change the way they think about making another one even though they said they weren't. I predict there will be another three movies so they make it a saga, but who will star in it and who will direct it? But as long as u have Optimus, my man B, and the rest of the gang you cant go wrong. And one last thing how bad ass did Optimus look when he turned and looked at Megatron and said \\"Time to find out\\".
B0030Y11XS|5.0|It's easy to see why Michael Moore makes certain people SO uncomfortable - he tells the truth! At one point in the film, Moore is told by a Wall Street executive: \\"Don't make any more movies!\\"   Yeah - fortunately for the rest of us, another of his masterpieces is hopefully right around the corner. Go, Michael! ;-)
B002AOWXQ8|3.0|This is a happy CD.  The opening track \\"40 Day Dream\\" is super-addictive with its big sound and the vocals \\"Ah, it's the magical mystery of life, Ah, must be alive.\\"  \\"Home\\" is a sweet track that I enjoy when I spin the disc, \\"Alabama, Arkansas, I do love my ma & pa.\\"  \\"Desert Song\\" & \\"Brother\\" are also good cuts.  Some of the other tracks like \\"Up From Below\\" suffer from a lead vocal that doesn't completely work.  That particular track sounds like it was recorded in a tin can.  With some stronger material and consistently strong vocals, this band could develop a really interesting sound.  It's like listening to a different drummer, lots of charm.  Enjoy!
B003ZSJ212|4.0|These Blu Ray transfers are very well done, even Phantom Menace.  You won't be disappointed.  The audio is incredible.  There is one caution however I've not seen comment on....the order you watch them.  Yes I know most everyone has already seen them starting from episode four all the way to episode three.  If you start with episode One, the Phantom Menace, and continue in sequence through episode Six Revenge of the Jedi, you will notice issues with story continuity and special effects.  You'll be going from unbelievably intense action sequences in Revenge of the Sith, to the relative benign fight scenes of A New Hope.  This is especially noticeable in the fight scene between Darth Vadar and Obi Wan on the Death Star.  Darth smites our friend Obi Wan in a seeming geriatric choreography of minor thrusts and parries that look rather silly when compared to what Mr. Lucas has given us in his later and more technologically advanced final three episodes.  An analogy might be made, when going from episode three to episode four, of continuing to walk a normal pace on an airport floor elevator and experiencing the abrupt lack of momentum once you've stepped off at the end.  If you can adjust to this required shift in what you're watching you'll do fine with this saga.  It's still one of Hollywood's finest examples of cinema and visceral entertainment and should be in everyone's video library.
B0055V6EZE|5.0|\\"St. James Infirmary\\" was previewed with Hugh Laurie's interview on NPR.  The piano playing riveted me.  He starts out with two + minutes of stately slow piano before the bass kicks in and then Laurie's voice snarls and snakes through the melody, continuing to plunk on the piano, \\"She was stretched out on a long white table, so cold, so sweet, so fair.\\"  It's a great track and made me run to the computer to place my order.  \\"You Don't Know My Mind\\" is the second track and keeps our attention riveted with a toe tapper, \\"Sometimes I think my baby's too good to die; sometimes I think she should be buried alive.\\"  Laurie pounds the ivories with some barrelhouse blasts on the lively \\"Swanee River.\\"  Irma Thomas elevates \\"John Henry\\" into the stratosphere.  \\"Tipitina\\" has Allen Toussaint's horn arrangement and sizzles out of my speakers.  The set concludes with the title track that sums up Laurie's effort.  He has fun and so we have fun.  Enjoy!<br /><br />Note: Song titles on the disc are incorrectly sequenced on my CD, listed on the computer in an incorrect order.
0385333846|3.0|This was my second and last Vonnegut book experience. While it is a significant improvement over his much later A Man Without a Country that I barely ranked with a single star, I wouldn't recommend Slaughterhouse Five above a light read. If I'd known that the WWII Dresden fire bombings were going to be set against imaginative space and time travel with a porn co-star I would have drank more, taken the whole story less seriously, and maybe had a few laughs. If there is a historical science fiction shelf, then that's where this book belongs.<br /><br />Poets and Writers magazine can hardly print an issue without a Vonnegut reference. For fans of his work, you don't need my review. For all others, I find his work to be well-regarded mediocrity. There are too many books I want to read to give Vonnegut another chance. If you find Slaughterhouse Five as the only paperback in the lending library at a beach resort, it's worth reading on vacation without any other choices. Otherwise keep shopping.
B004TTZHBK|4.0|This app is a sizable download and also requires additional downloads to get all the video content (but that content is available at no extra charge so it's just a matter of time and bandwidth).  And $8 seems a wee bit pricey to me, but this is defintely a quality app.  It's got a great interface and is well organized.  The videos are very informative and well produced.<br /><br />Some people complain that these recipes are \\"simple\\".  But that's the whole point to Jamie Oliver -- make healthy and tasty dishes while keeping it simple.  If you can afford it, this is a great app that is well organized, well produced and delivers on it's goal of providing good, healthy 20 minute meals.
0679735259|5.0|This book was the talk of my latest grad school residency. I subsequently devoured it and was not disappointed. More than a war story, it's an emersion in that dark piece of American history. Warning--no punches are pulled. While not overdone, many scenes are graphic and many characters die. This book has my strongest recommendation.
B0055S348W|5.0|This app is a bit on the pricey side, but it really delivers and then some.  Not only was it able to find and print to my printer effortlessly, but it also has a wonderful interface that lets you choose what you want to print.  On the one hand, I'd like to subtract one star for the seemingly high price, but on the other hand it actually EXCEEDED my expectations in its ability to print and ease of use.  Price notwithstanding, if you have a need or desire to print from your mobile device, this app is top notch.<br />HTC EVO 4G and HP wireless printer.

0439023513|2.0|I was okay with the plot of this book; its execution was what bothered me.<br /><br />One of the things I loved about the original book, and, to a lesser extent, the second, was how well everything was paced. The places where the book slowed down and the places where it went a mile a minute felt natural. There was good flow. In Mockingjay, the plot seemed to move in fits and starts that didn't match the tempo of the events that were happening. A lot of the major events happen \\"off camera,\\" so to speak, so much so that I began to question why we were still seeing the story through Katniss' eyes and not someone who was conscious or present for the events. Then, toward the end of the book, there's a rush of major events that don't seem to carry any emotional weight as the plot barrels through to the end. Now, I understand that Katniss would be in shock, and might not be feeling the full extent of the events, but it just felt...empty. Low impact. Rushed. I'm not sure I can properly qualify what I'm trying to say here, but it just didn't sit right with me. It didn't mesh with the Katniss I've come to know, and it felt as if I were reading a point form summary instead of the ending of the novel.<br /><br />As well, I felt that the book's climax came out of nowhere, and the in-world reaction to it didn't make any sense to me. I actually reread the section several times trying to figure out why there wasn't a bigger uproar over what she did, or why she actually made that decision in the first place. The pieces of the puzzle are there and I can see what the author was trying to do, but they just don't fit together properly in my head. Feels forced.<br /><br />Overall, I'm very disappointed with the execution of this book, particularly the last third of it. I do recommend that fans of the first two books read this one, but keep in mind that you may not be too happy with how the story is told.
030726999X|5.0|Oh, my. How do I even begin to write this review?<br /><br />Personally, I find it hard to write reviews for books in a series, simply because I feel like I'm expressing the same opinion over and over again. While this wasn't the case between the first book and the second book (if you recall, I enjoyed the second one much more than the first), it is true when comparing the second and third installment. Picking up right where The Girl Who Played With Fire left off, I found myself completely riveted from beginning to end. I can't really describe what draws me into these books... maybe the characters? Lisbeth, of course, who is the driving force. And then Mikael, of course, who helps her on the way. And add to that a huge government conspiracy theory and I'm sold.<br /><br />That being said, I'm not going to ramble too much. This series is really good for mature readers (adults, mostly, but being a mature teenager I'd also recommend it to others like myself). Highly recommend this series.
0439023521|4.0|After several different recommendations, I finally picked up \\"The Hunger Games.\\" It has been many years since I've been so swept up in a book that I read it as I'm commuting to work and even walking down the road, but this book had me absolutely mesmerized. The tempo is bang-on, with racing speed and pensive lingering in all the right places. I immediately took a liking to Katniss: strong, independent and flawed. Peeta, while a bit flatter, was charming enough that he grew on me. The plot itself is familiar (maybe even a little played out, if you read a lot of sci fi), but the pacing, the characters and the little flourishes of unique detail made it something special. Overall, an easy, enjoyable and intense read.
B004DI7HZ6|1.0|I have read the first 9 chapters in this book and I'm bored. I keep waiting for something to happen and so far nothing. Usually after the 4th or 5th chapter I expect for a story to grip me but all I've gotten so far is that the main character has come across a mysterious book and is hanging out with a vampire. Really? It took 9 chapters to tell me this? I can't stand the thought of reading another chapter so I'm done.
B005NA3B8U|2.0|R-Type is a great classic side scrolling shooter, unfortunately it was one of the more difficult (and fun) ones and this does not translate well to a touch screen controls.  It would be a 3 or 4 star if you could assign keys to functions rather than fumble w/just a touch screen dpad.
1439153663|3.0|I actually really enjoyed the first half of the book, despite it's unrealistic characters and preponderance of rapists. The last half I had to force myself through because it was just one horrible thing after another. Or worse, the same horrible things over and over.   The concept is great and the characters are interesting, but they have 21st century personalities and self-awareness a couple of hundred years too soon. The slave dialect is also VERY inconsistent. I found the avoidance of the N-word to be jarring, when we all know it would have been used. The slaves seem to have little work to do other than fuss over the white folks and inventory their possessions.    Some of the action is poorly described or just silly. And Rankin manages to be everywhere at the same time, catching out Lavinia and the house servants at every turn, all while managing/abusing the field workers and being passed out drunk. Just when somebody starts to be happy, here comes Rankin again to mess it up!   If you're looking for a light read with a dark atmosphere, then this would be a good choice. If you're looking for substance, not so much.

B002G1YPH0|3.0|Coolers are way too important to compromise with - especially if you plan to overclock.  If you're not an overclocker and money is tight, this one probably would be sufficient.  If you want to get max life out of your CPU -bust loose and buy the Noctua DH-14.
B000GIWRIY|5.0|I've enjoyed this one since its release in '95.  As I listen to it now,  I realise this is a Must Buy for the genuine Tull fan.  Most likely, the typical Aqualung only fan, can happily live without it.  Plainly & simply:  After all the passing years & albums,  it is one of THE BEST Tull records. (period).  Enjoy thoroughly!  It even gets really heavy and rocking in some parts!  Whoa!<br />P.S.  I'm not familiar with the remastered edition,  but wonder if it's necessary.  Perhaps in this era of remastering meaning:  ruining  beloved, classic recordings with loudness war techniques, it would be wise to avoid it.

B003UESJHY|4.0|Its a pretty good movie.  To me the most impressive thing is the acting of Christian Bale.  If you are familar with him, he speaks with a very heavy british accent.  But in this movie, you would swear hes native from Boston.  I love his character.  A washed-up has-been boxer who is now a lowly depraved crack addict.  His acting is perfect to me.  The movie itself is pretty good, only a little slow at times.  There arent actually many fight scenes but the ones there are, are good.  Its very Rocky-like.  Especially the final climactic fight scene, its very energizing.

B004AYCWZI|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed the journey of this novel. Beginning in Mumbai India and traveling around the world with Hassan Haji, this novel brought to life all of the sights and smells of India, beginning in Hassan's grandfather's restaurant in Mumbai. It also brought to life every idea I have about India, from the fast pace to the raucous outdoor markets (and also confirmed my belief that if I ever do to India, I need to take my own food!). What a wonderful journey Hassin made, even though it began in tragedy, as his entire family fled India upon the murder of his mother. As his father tried to get his bearings after losing his wife, the family finally opens an authentic Indian restaurant right across from, and much to the dismay of, Madame Gertrude Mallory, owner of Le Saule Pleureur. After some back and forth, often heated and once close to tragic, the Hajis and Madame Mallory reach a truce of sorts, and this is the beginning of the hundred foot journey that changed the course of Hassan's life.

B004G25V9S|5.0|Never a band known for being resistant to change, or risk-adverse, Opeth deliver their most controversial platter yet with their 10th observation Heritage. The reports I have been seeing on their Facebook profile are entertaining. Because the responses from the fan community run the absolute gamut from 'masterpiece, album of the year' to 'what the hell is this, i'm burning all my Opeth merchandise'. Heritage was a huge creative risk for the band. Did it pay off? In my opinion, yes, it most certainly did. Heritage marks possibly the biggest change in tone I've heard in a band's sound since Porcupine Tree's In Absentia. Rather than blastbeats or guttural demonic vocals, here we have prog jazz freakouts, nods to Camel, King Crimson, and Rainbow, and flutes.   Some have been saying that the songs on this album lack melody and structure. There are melodies in the songs, maybe not as in your face and immediately apparent as on some of their other albums, but then, when has Opeth ever been known for a simplistic verse/chorus/verse formula? The album is one of those that may not hit you straight away on first listen. It's a slow burner. But it really does grow on you, and you realise how fantastic these songs truly are. They really understand the dynamics and subtleties of music. They know that silence can be just as effective as bombast and noise. Listen to Heritage on a decent 5.1 surround system and you'll be blown away. Mendez on bass really gets his chance to shine on this disc, after being unfortunately rendered inaudible on many of their prior releases. Martin Axenrot also excels here, and proves his chops on the drums with aplomb.   Favourite tracks so far are Famine, with it's slightly frightening Jethro Tull-esque flute section (I implore anyone who laments that Heritage is not heavy enough to listen to this track. It may not be metal, but man, that flute sounds EVIL); I Feel The Dark, and the almighty Folklore. In Opeth's 20 plus years on the game, this is one ofmy favourite ever compositions by them. The closing instrumental Marrow of the Earth is eerily reminiscent of Camel's The Snow Goose. Just listen to the chord changes. It sounds uncannily like Andy Latimer's style, to the extent that I often forgot I was listening to Opeth and not vintage Camel.   Those with an open mind will appreciate the hard work, passion, and musical skill that went into Heritage. Metalheads may feel left out in the cold, but really Opeth were always so much more than a metal band. They incorporated elements of prog, jazz, classical, folk, and everything in between into their disparate sound, from the very beginning. Their recent move towards unabashed prog should not have been a huge surprise for any close observer of the band. If anything, I hope to hear them continue down this direction, and that Heritage is merely a transition to something even better in the future. They've proved themselves to be artists of integrity to their vision, and that they are willing to challenge themselves and their listeners (rare feats in today's musical landscape). The truly great artists from the Beatles, Radiohead, Porcupine Tree, Led Zeppelin, Pink Floyd, amongst others, never rested on their laurels or tread the same musical ground twice. Imagine if the Beatles kept making Please Please Me over and over again? We'd never have heard Sgt Peppers or Abbey Road. The more change resistant members of the Opeth fanbase clamouring for more death metal like Blackwater Park really do not get Opeth at all. They've stretched themselves, and left their comfort zone. And for that I have true respect for them. An astonishing piece of work, and my album of the year without a doubt.

B004DK5CW4|2.0|*** This review may contain spoilers ***<br /><br />Despite being an inveterate horse player, I had some trepidation as to whether 'Secretariat' was going to turn out to be a good film. Just how many horse races can you show before the story begins to feel repetitious? No matter how great Secretariat was as a race horse, a story of this sort (to be successful) must ultimately focus on the external conflict between the human players as well as the internal arc of the protagonist.<br /><br />The protagonist here is Penny Chenery, a Denver housewife, who arrives at her childhood home in Virginia, following the death of her mother. Her 'home' is actually Meadow Stables, owned by her father, Christopher, now stricken with dementia and is almost completely unaware of his surroundings. In real life, Penny's father was never at the farm at the time of his wife's death, having been hospitalized for five straight years in a hospital in New Rochelle, N.Y., until his death in 1973. The film's scenarist wasn't lying when it's made clear in the credits that the events in the film are \\"suggested by\\" and not \\"based on\\" the book 'Secretariat: The Making of a Champion'.<br /><br />Despite playing loose with the facts, the opening 'funeral' scene is effective as it conveys Penny Chenery's heart-felt grief over the death of her mother. There are more interesting scenes in the first half of 'Secretariat'. In perhaps the best scene in the film, after deciding to take over the reins at Meadow Stables, Penny confronts and fires a dishonest trainer who attempted to sell some of the stables' horses at a lower price than they were worth, before being stopped by Penny's mother. Equally as interesting is the famous 'coin toss' scene where leading owner Ogden Phipps gains the right to breed one of Penny's two mares with his best stallion, Bold Ruler.<br /><br />'Secretariat' begins to lose steam when we're introduced to John Malkovich who plays Lucien Laurin, hired by Penny to be Secretariat's trainer. The sarcastic Malkovich is completely miscast as Laurin, who according to Secretariat's real-life jockey, Ron Turcotte, never wore flashy clothes, played golf or was a \\"goofball\\". Worse than that, the film implies that Meadow Stables had lost profitability by the time Secretariat was about to win the Triple Crown. In actuality, Roger Laurin, Lucien's son, was hired in 1969 and returned the farm to profitability by cutting costs. After he left to the Phipps farm, Lucien came on board and in 1972, trained Riva Ridge to win both the Kenturcky Derby and Belmont States. So it's not convincing that Lucien was 'down and out' at the time Penny asked him to become Secretariat's trainer. Nor am I convinced that Meadow Stables was also 'down and out', especially after Riva Ridge was so successful in 1972. We're asked to believe that Penny is forced to syndicate Secretariat's breeding rights to save the farm but I suspect it was simply a shrewd, business move.<br /><br />Further dragging 'Secretariat' down are the hokey family scenes which includes some minor conflict that goes nowhere between one of Penny's daughters who happens to be playing an anti-war activist in school. And what of Penny's husband? He's shown siding with Penny's brother about selling the farm and it's implied that the couple had some kind of falling out. In actuality, Penny divorced her husband and that's never shown in the film at all. As in most Disney films, the less unpleasantness, the better!<br /><br />The second half of the film begins with Secretariat's first race as a two year old, which is not seen on screen. After the race, trainer Laurin explains to Penny that he simply \\"wasn't ready\\". It's also implied that Secretariat won the rest of his races as a two year old. The film leaves out the fact that Secretariat was disqualified in the Champagne Stakes and placed second. Although Secretariat runs third in the Wood Memorial at Aqueduct, this time he has an excuse: an abscess is found in hismouth.<br /><br />Director Randall serves up a series of ho-hum racing scenes to illustrate Secretariat's triumph in winning the Triple Crown. The most glaring fault of his Derby recreation, is filming the Triple Crown infields at small Evangeline Downs in Louisiana. Wisely, he utilized the actual race for the Preakness by having Penny's family watch it on a TV screen, thus cutting down on the repetitiousness of all the racing scenes. Randall employs all wrong Gospel music during Secretariat's stretch run during the Belmont Stakes as well as allowing all kinds of bloopers to creep in (for example, during the Belmont Stakes, the long shots show Secretariat alone increasing his lead, yet, on a couple of close-ups another horse can be seen running next to him.)<br /><br />The weak second half also features a weak antagonist in the guise of trainer Pancho Martin who bad mouths Penny during the Triple Crown news conference. According to Ron Turcotte, Martin actually was a decent guy and doesn't deserve the vituperative treatment depicted here.<br /><br />I wonder if Secretariat can really be considered the greatest horse of all time. When Citation won the Triple Crown in 1948, television was in its infancy and he simply did not not have the advantage of all the media hype which Secretariat did. Consider that Secretariat won 16 of 21, never finishing below fourth as a three year old but Citation won 27 out of 29, with two seconds and raced after he was a three year old (unlike Secretariat).<br /><br />As a basic by the numbers introduction to Secretariat, the film certainly does its job and one can't argue with Diane Lane's fine performance as Penny Chenery. But ultimately the film never reproduces the excitement one felt viewing the Triple Crown races back in 1973.acing scenes to illustrate Secretariat's triumph in winning the Triple Crown.

0446571415|3.0|This is a pulp fiction thriller that almost does what it is supposed to do - entertain you for three hours without straining the gray cells. Ignore the wafer thin plot, the innumerable holes in the wafer-thin plot, and the curiously fast-paced narrative that still takes a long time to get anywhere.<br /><br />A bomb explodes at Lafayette Park, just as the motorcade of the British Prime Minister exits the White House. Oliver Stone (aka John Carr) is called out from retirement(?) and requested by the President to go after the drug cartel (Mexicans and Russians) that is pumping drugs into the country. Then he is drafted to investigate the terrorist bombing. Promising premise, and there are several intriguing twists introduced, but never taken to their fullest conclusions. They are abandoned midway for even more twists, that yet again fail to culminate in any sort of nail-biting finish.<br /><br />Since this is the fifth installment in the \\"Camel Club\\" series, and since I have not read the previous four, I have to assume that the earlier ones would have been better, and their success would have driven this fifth.
6304493681|1.0|So I ordered three of my all time favorite Manga videos because my original VHS versions have pretty much come to the end of their rope. This, Ninja Scroll and Akira. I have yet to check out the Ninja Scroll DVD, Hopefully its not as big of a disappointment. The DVD I received of this movie is not even the version advertised here on the site not even the same cover work. It seems to me to be some lame Americanized production with the lame 3-D effect graphics that pretty much dates it's reproduction. I couldn't even stand to sit thru the first five minutes. I guess lesson learned don't order manga on a whim without first reading the negative reviews.
0062060554|1.0|This book is far too long. The story is dragged out and it is hard to stay interested. Much time is spent with the husband coming home from work. Disappointing.
B0058VW36U|5.0|This is really a great game. Simple and fun. Job well done. I would highly recommend it to anyone. It's also a great game for kids for puzzle solving.
0345472322|5.0|This book is worth the read, especially if you are a parent.  Dr. Dweck covers a whole range of topics, but most importantly, how we teach and how we learn.  While memorization may have its place in the learning process, Whole Language has managed to drag down our reading, writing, and comprehension levels(the #1 reason why the U.S.A. has fallen behind in education...ahh, the dumbing of America).  This book takes a good solid look at how and why we set ourselves up for failure, counter-poses the \\"fixed\\" mindset to the \\"growth\\" mindset. Time to change things up!
B0050SYS5A|1.0|Well, the Zoom does as it says - your playing area doubles, meaning you don't have to haul all of your furniture out of the room you're playing in.  But the Kinect cannot track you with the Zoom attached.  It would not recognize me and auto-enable my profile, would not detect my hands or face.  Tried turning on all the lights, and that didn't help either.  So I couldn't even get into calibration mode.  Looked online for helpful tips, and nothing worked, but found enough frustration from other early adopters to make my mind up - shipped back for a refund the same day I got it.
B0015DROBO|4.0|It was pretty good.  The beginning is slow the buildup is great but then the ending is weak.  Worth reading though
B005EZJ3MW|1.0|I feel like Demi is going to tell us that this album was her version of a sick joke. There are only 2 songs on this album that are worth listening to. Demi, your voice sounds best when it's not masked by machine manipulation. You're too good for that!!!
B000000HRP|5.0|1. This was one of those recording sessions where it all came together and everyone's creativity was hitting on all cylinders.  Ain't no half-steppin' here.  2. Phil Collins kicks a s s on drums-- every fill slams just right.  3. If a thirteen-fingered space alien learned to play electric bass by listening to records by Bootsy Collins and Jaco Pastorius, he/she/it might sound almost as \\"out there\\" as Percy Jones.  He creates his own language and logic for the instrument.  There's NOBODY who sounds and thinks like Jones does!  4. Jones and Collins were also recording on Brian Eno sessions (such as Another Green World) at about the same time as this album was made.  Check out the Eno/Snatch single \\"R.A.F.\\" for another one of their funk grooves.   5. The British black humor in the song titles carries over into the music.  A dark, sardonic mood predominates-- another thing that prevents this from ever coming close to the \\"fusion-lite\\" style that was already starting to make itself known by 1975-76.  6. If you like this music, also check out the Quiet Sun album \\"Mainstream\\".  It's a little more 'rock', but a good complement to this.  7. And to top it all off, this album was engineered by Dennis Mackay.  Along with Dieter Dierks (on mid-'70s Passport), Mackay provided some of the richest, crispest, fattest studio sound of the pre-digital age, and it only enhances the great music here.
B004ZZS4CC|3.0|I bought this because I wanted to know exactly what she went through and how she felt. It tells exactly that. She does mention that it's not written the best, and you have to remember she only has a 5th grade reading/writing level. Basically it's like reading her diary. Some parts are really graphic and disturbing, but she's just recounting exactly what happened. I had a hard time getting through this because I felt so bad for her, and knowing this is a true story makes it even worse. But, it does have a happy ending. If you're squeamish don't bother. It's much too horrifying and graphic. That poor girl....

B002ZG980U|1.0|This movie did not begin. It had no middle. It had no ending. It was a literal mad mad mad world.  There were live so called actors, yet they seemed like animated robots.The style of the movie seemed as if it were an adult animated presentation. There were too many characters, character over-kill. When this happens, there is no one to invest in nor care about.  Sitting through this movie was literal torture and misery. All I wanted it to do was end. I was shocked it was 2 1/2 hours. Average movies are 90 minutes. A good movie is hard to sit through for 2 hours. This awful movie was 2 1/2 hours of madness. I gave the DVD away the day after I saw it.   Either that, or I would have trashed it. Total waste of time and money.  I had heard that the Musical Score was good. Through the entire movie, there was endless senseless violence, gunfire, fighting and various accidents, all of this was constant noise and I kept wondering, \\"Where is the musical score? What musical score?\\" If there as one, I never heard it.   I noticed brief appearances by Michael Cane and Tom Berringer and felt sadness as I realized what a waste of talent and how rock bottom these once quality actors had been reduced to sink to.   I could not tell who was the Good, nor The Bad Nor The Ugly! What the heck was that?!  I have absolutely nothing good to say about this movie and give it a total Thumbs Down.
B005AKFXZW|3.0|Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed this book. I switched off my brain and just read.  I was totally confused with the jumps in time though. I finally got hold of what was happening and the plot would jump back/forward a few years. I didn't think it needed to jump around as the way it flowed could have happened in the normal flow of time. The jumping confused me in that I didn't get how something that happened 3 years prior (or later) seemed to follow on exactly as it would have if it all was in chronological order.  Reading on a Kindle made the time jumps hard to follow as I couldn't flick the pages to see what the last year was and work out where I was in the storyline. In the end I ignored the years and kept reading as if it was happening in normal chronological order and it made no difference.
B003ZSJ212|4.0|These movies are phenomenal!  The only complaint I have, and it's a minor one, is that they over emphasized the color WAY too much, and it's obvious in certain scenes!  I keep thinking that my projector is blooming, but then, upon confirming my settings, I realize that it's the source material.  It's more noticable on certain scenes than others (you should be able to tell).  Aside from this occasional distraction, the series is excellent, looks great, the audio is dynamic!  Overall...thumbs up!
B004S5C91Q|1.0|I didn't enjoy this book much. The child was a pain in the backside and the mother an idiot. Things happened in rather convenient ways and the child's escape and the mother and room's discovery seemed very quick and too easy. It felt very much like the author was cashing in on what has been happening in the news without actually doing any work of her own.   Don't waste your time or money.
0765316897|5.0|Excellent way to conclude his trilogy.  I loved the characters, theme, and plot.  There is such a depth and passion about the way he writes, you will not be disappointed.
B0037RDPEG|1.0|Oh. My. God. This book was boring. There are no words. I managed to struggle through the first part ('Eat') and got so bored over the part in India ('Pray') where the character goes all religious that I put the book down and didn't bother finishing it. I don't understand why there was so much hype. I've only gotten through the 'Eat' part of the movie and haven't finished that either.
B000O8OTNC|2.0|This works alright for your small pocket soft metal pocket knives.  It does put a different angle on most blades than the factory edge.  Also, that new edge it creates isnt as durable as the factory angle.  Which is the reason why i gave it a 2 star only.  Recommend investing in a better sharpener.
B005D0RDIE|5.0|Wow! What can I except it was an Awesome Experience....I'm 52 yrs young been a Rush fan from the Beginning I remember having the 8 track of the 1st Album & jamming down the Highway listening to Working Man when I was still a young pup...Always excellent music to drive by...LOL..Anyway, I'm from the Cleveland area....Caught the news Rush was playing at Quicken Arena only a couple days before they performed & heard they were gonna film it...I kinda shrugged not having tickets & thought Boy I wish I were going...ANyway, the day of the show I get a call out the blue at 5 p.m. from my friend Mario Who worked Don's Lite house. Mario is a great friend whom I usually would take on occassion to some events with me because he was married & didn't have alot of extra cash most times. I took him to Skynryd when they were here for the Rowdy friends tour, a monster truck show etc...Well my kindness through the years I guess paid off & big time!...Cause he tells me he has Rush tickets for this show & that they were given to him by his boss & were for his boss's lodge...So we had great seats, great eats, free beer, & a great time! What a Rush...seeing Rush play songs from the beginning to now...A definate timeline & for the long time fan like me a real treat...And now I'll be able to get a Bluray of the whole thing...I'm truely Blessed...Long Live Rush!

B005BGBPBG|5.0|Loved it... totally worth watching.  Teaches, I guess, about life's complications, but so long as you're honest with yourself... it'll be okay, regardless of the outcome.  Good friends, trying to do what's right, retaining your dignity... great movie.
B0006SNK9E|5.0|One song after another, not only all of the songs here we grew up listening to, this album contains almost all of the songs from the US released Desolation Boulevard. An absolute masterpiece from 1974, Sweet should have been elected to the Rock N Roll Hall of Fame decades ago and yet, has never received proper credit for their musicianship and effort, but they have influenced plenty over the years. But hey, that's okay. Millions of fans around the world to this day, still loves Sweet, who were truly the poets of 3 minute jams in the 70s. Long live Sweet and Brian Connolly. Peace.
B004QK5N5W|3.0|As other comments have said, the adapter works fine. But if the app isn't compatible with your television viewing, you're not going to buy the adapter, right? Unfortunately, what this meant for us is that while television shows fill the television screen, movies are shrunken down to 1/4 of the screen in a rectangular box. I don't really care *why* this happens (I know it's caused by the different dimensions of the iPad vs. our HDMI television screen). It looks like we won't be disconnecting the PC (on which viewing media through the internet has its own annoying problems) from the television anytime soon. Still, the price isn't high for an iPad accessory and setup is instantaneous. Cautiously recommended.
B0055SWM08|5.0|Loved the levels on this game and the music is very soothing when you are frustratingly stuck on a level.
B00536OCZA|4.0|The company that made this album should use a little more quality control at the plant. The first one I ordered had tons of scuff marks and a scratch on the second side. My replacement still has scuff marks on it, but sounds good. I'm pretty sure this company is going to press The Wall and Wish you were here. Please, be careful when you make those. I'm sure there were other companies bidding for the HONOR to make these albums, treat it as such, and tell your employees how important these albums are to rock history.
B004LWZW4W|5.0|I thought this movie was GREAT!!!  I saw once with my wife, then we brought the kids, and then we brought the kids and their friends again!  They loved it, and I thought it was one of the best SCI-FI movies and best special effects yet!  All I can say is WOW!  I was entertained, which is all that this is about!
B001TODO54|5.0|Stunning.Amazing.<br />It's not that i can't speak but that i can't find the right word....<br />Katsa is a brilliant character. Lost and yet she knows where she'd going, at least until she meets Po (or prince Greening) he shakes her world and introduces her to new feelings. I love all the characters. For a debut novel this is...Better than some author's fifth books. Definitley a WOW book. Can't wait to read Fire!!!
B004VMUS9G|1.0|This developer had this \\"app as the free app of the day\\" from Amazon. Amazon pays the dev for a partial amount of every download for the free app. The developer a few days after updated the app to be a FREE version that had adds. They cheated the system and Amazon.

038533348X|1.0|There's no such thing as \\"ice nine,\\" nor could there ever be; \\"Bokononism\\" isn't so much a half-baked Buddhism or Taoism as it is a smug excuse for pseudo-enlightened Westerners to laugh at others behind their back; Mona's probably the most \\"pedestalized\\" and least realistic woman character I've come across in literature of this pedigree; etc.<br /><br />Take all the pretensions out (those listed above, and the wall-to-wall others) and the propulsive force of the novel ceases to exist.  I read this in college and was underwhelmed, to say the least (at the Univ. of Chicago, I might add -- and, while the Common Core science requirements sure were hard, *I* didn't drop out and invent my OWN!).  Only later did it dawn on me that the shared \\"smugness\\" was part of -- nay, the very CRUX -- of its \\"appeal.\\"<br /><br />Save your time & money.  Read Pynchon's \\"V.\\" -- published the same year -- instead, and you'll have so many \\"guns\\" in your psyche fired you'll be set for life!
B004GYY714|4.0|This is the first app I have tried from the Amazon App store, and as it turned out, this was a good place to start. It works amazingly well on my HTC Inspire 4G, and it is not complicated to learn to maneuver through it and find what you want to hear. There are so many good choices for listening. I was a little disappointed to find out that my two local hometown stations aren't there, but then a message in the app told me that they have not been made available for streaming.
B005KAH7QU|5.0|My boyfriend has been asking me to see this film for a while, but I thought it was going to be another one of those brainless testosterone flicks, so I waited....  Surprisingly, I liked this movie so much that I actually paused it to make a phone call to recommend it to someone else.  We even went back and watched some parts over again that were very entertaining and humorous (for those with a slightly bent sense of humor.  I could usually predict a movie as it goes, but was refreshingly surprised with the scenes.  I thought the story line held true and was believable.  Overall, I'm surprised that it has such mixed reviews because my boyfriend and I both really enjoyed the film.  It's a good movie to watch.
B003Y5HWK4|5.0|Boardwalk Empire is an exquisitely produced hour long drama on HBO. Some have expressed dislike for the slow storylines and pacing as well as what I've heard described as a weaker season long arc. I personally find the show to be fantastic and the pacing is refreshing and suits the atmosphere being created in 1920's Atlantic City. The Sopranos itself was a slower paced show if one really looks back on it, the deaths come but only at the leisure of the story. The one thing that cannot be contested in regards to this show is the production value, the boardwalk they've created, the sets, the period costumes and the sheer amount of quality casting/acting that fill this universe. The story also spans from Atlantic City to New York and Chicago. It's an amazing feat that they've pulled off at all let alone so well.  This long awaited first season set will thankfully contain not only the twelve first season episodes but a plethora of special featuers that take viewers behind the scenes. I wish the Sopranos had been granted season sets this elaborate, this set might rival the quality of the Breaking Bad season sets, which have themselves always been packed with extras.  The Twelve Episodes Included (Just out of interest):  Boardwalk Empire  The Ivory Tower  Broadway Limited  Anastasia  Nights In Ballygran  Family Limitation  Home  Hold Me in Paradise  Belle Femme  The Emerald City  Paris Green  A Return to Normalcy  An excellently crafted slow burn season that establishes this world and takes some interesting twists, turns and sudden plot developments but only once they've been earned. I don't want to give anything away to those who haven't seen it adn those who have seen it know how well constructed it is.  Special Features:  Exclusive to Blu-ray, Enhanced Viewing: fans will be able to enjoy a picture in picture experience on each episode that delves into the production process with cast and crew and also into the Atlantic City history the show is based on with Historians.(This sounds incredible).  Making Boardwalk Empire: A standard behind-the-scenes look at the making of the series with cast and crew.  Character Dossier: An evolving comprehensive character guide allows viewers to follow development of major players.  Creating the Boardwalk: Explores how they designed and built the massive 300 foot boardwalk.  Atlantic City: The Original Sin City - A 30 minute documentary that explores the roaring 20's in Atlantic City. (Nice to see them also focusing on providing historical material for a series such as this).  Speakeasy Tour: Cast members from the series provide an insider's tour of famed prohibition era speakeasies in Chicago and New York.  Audio Commentaries: Six will be provided featuring different combinations of actors Steve Buscemi, Michael Kenneth Williams and Michael Shannon. Creator/writer/executive producer Terence Winter, Director/Writer/Executive Producer Tim Van Patten, Writer?Supervising Producer Howard Korder and directors Brian Kirk and Allen Coulter.  This is quite the comprehensive set that should please any fan of the series and might interest some historians. I am now beginning to feel the long wait for this release was worth it. Every show should attempt to provide this much supplementry material.  Season 2 is already building up to be fantastic! If this isn't a five star series I don't know what is. Thankfully it seems to be receiving a five star set.

B005G4TJUC|1.0|Sorry with my english for i am from Montréal.<br /><br />I still do not want to give up on Michael Bay. When i see him in interviews, underneath his condescending tone and his obvious self-love, i see an educated and intelligent man. I still have hope that he will mature eventually and direct a genuine great film. But right now, he is a teenager. He obviously thinks that most of his audience is dumb, sexually depraved and uneducated. The way he films women, the way he portrays the adults, the things he makes them say and do, the \\"comedy\\" that he puts in there and that he thinks will make us laugh, all of this makes me think that Michael Bay simply sees his fans as cavemen. And by reading some of the comments here, well my God, he's about right!<br /><br />It is not a question of putting your brain to neutral in order to enjoy a good old \\"pop corn\\" movie. Not all \\"pop corn\\" movies are good. \\"Transformers 3\\" is a bad movie. Just like the second one. Probably even more. The characters are stupid. The dialog is corny. The intentions are childish. And we just don't care about anything. And why, oh why, do incredible and sexy women fall so much in love with Sam? It is so obvious that Bay was a shy and rejected teenager and that he couldn't get... well, nevermind. I don't know how Michael Bay and his team can watch a movie like that knowing that other people will witness such a disgraceful work of art. How can they be proud?<br /><br />God knows i enjoy all sort of films. Pop corn movies and art films. I loved the first \\"Transformers\\". But it is clear to me now that Steven Spielberg had more of a word to say in the first one.<br /><br />And when i hear people calling this third film \\"Excellent\\" or \\"Perfect\\"... it's beyond me.<br /><br />The first part of the film, the prologue that is, when it deals with the missions on the Moon, well that part is truly fun. Those small parts are the ones that make me think that Bay will, one day, make a great \\"Pop Corn\\" movie. But the more i see him going and the more i hear him talk, i'm starting to think that he won't be able to do it on his own, that he'll need someone else to help him along the way, like Spielberg in the first \\"Transformers\\".<br /><br />Again, i'm all for \\"Pop Corn\\" movies. I enjoy them. But the directors must respect the viewer's intelligence. Michael Bay does not. He is clearly saying that you are dumb. And some of you are worshiping him.<br /><br />Well you get the movies you diserve.
B0052GACNM|5.0|The quintessential American music icon, Tony Bennett has somehow managed to out do himself as he invites 17 superstars from genres as varied as rock, pop, R&B, Latin, opera, and country to shine with him on a collection of musical masterpieces and there's nothing like it. No wonder DUETS II has debuted at #1 on the Billboard 200 Album chart with 179,000 copies sold during week one! This is the first #1 album in Mr. Bennett's unparalleled career, even after all the other top ten albums and #1 singles over 60 years. All this, as Tony turns 85! That amazing voice is still powerful, the energy and humor and positivity are still there, and the resulting performances are magical. From the whimsical \\"The Lady Is a Tramp\\" with Lady Gaga to the now bittersweet \\"Body and Soul\\" with the late Amy Winehouse and the swinging \\"Don't Get Around Much Anymore\\" with Michael Buble, it absolutely doesn't get any better than this! ~SCOTT O'BRIEN
B004P8JPS6|5.0|An excellent book. It is the story of Reacher's last mission in the Army, so it is a look back to the past. In the same way, this book also harkens back the Lee Child's earlier efforts in the Reacher series. Jack is back to being the physical, thorough investigator. Seemingly reluctant, yet never squeamish or hesitant. He is again, the reluctant hero. There is not as much action is this story, but is moves quickly along with a few twists and turns. All in all, it will rank among my favorites in the series. It makes me want to start reading them all over again!
1596680296|5.0|I just received this book in the mail today 9/30/2011 around 3:30 p.m. Within ten minutes of reading this book I was able to cast on to my four double pointed needles. There is no true part (that I've seen) about distributing the yarn on the other three needles, but with the way the book shows you to cast on, instructions aren't needed, it's common sense once you've got your stitches because you learn to cast on in a secure way (Using the tail end of the string and the string from your yarn ball.) The part about knitting in the round is brief too, but I also have Ann Budd's Master Class sock knitting book and had seen her knit in the round on the DVD that is included with that book[[ASIN:1596683120 Sock Knitting Master Class: Innovative Techniques + Patterns from Top Designers]]  I learned to knit in the round in ten minutes using the simple joining method, so far I have about half an inch on my sock's cuff. I would highly suggest buying Getting Started Knitting Socks, you won't regret it. Hold off on Ann Budd's Master Class if you're a beginner like me, it might be a while before you use it. I plan to keep my copy of Master Class but it's more for an intermediate to advanced knitter. Getting Started Knitting Socks is where you should start. :)
B000E1ZK5A|1.0|About the only thing they got right was that World War Two was fought in the in a lot of water with boats. Mediocre acting aside, the historical inaccuracies were so glaring that they were an acutal distraction.    Not to go too deep; so many have already posted excellent (bad - but fitting) reviews to this movie. I'll just add a few observations as well.  * Submarines of the time did not have the capability to conduct sub to sub combat while submerged.  I think they got this confused with Hunt for Red October.  * You wouldn't see a German Destroyer alone that far from the coast.  * If we needed to break the code - I'd assume they didn't know the code - yet they knew that a German Sub was in trouble.  * The enigma machine was a good catch (which the British actually accomplished) but it was the code books that were the real key.  * German plane would have been incapable of reaching that scene.  * Etc....  For a real underwater classic, Das Boot is the only choice you need.
0385344325|3.0|I have read several other novels featuring Jack Reacher, but I'm by no means an expert on the series.  That's one of the reasons I wanted to read this book so much.  I wanted to understand what had happened to Reacher to make him choose the life of a vagabond who moves from one place to another with no encumbrances whatsoever.  I couldn't leave everything I own behind constantly so I wanted to understand why Jack Reacher could.  Well, this book simply told me that those aspects of his personality were established long before he left the military.<br /><br />The book was a good read for me, but I had so many issues with it that I can't say it will ever be a favorite or a book I will want to read again.  Reacher is sent into an undercover position to find out what is happening in a situation at a super secret army base in northern Mississippi.  Another MP officer will be sent inside the base to investigate officially, without Reacher's help.  Reacher meets the local sheriff who turns out to be an ex-Marine MP who is the most beautiful woman he has ever seen.  Okay, that part was fine until I'm asked to believe that a law enforcement department comprised of three officers has been investigating multiple murders over a nine month period, not making any progress whatsoever, and yet has never called for help from any of the many state agencies available to them.  Add to that the black vs white race issue which is always under a spotlight in Mississippi.  I think it was completely unbelievable that this situation would ever have been allowed to exist.  So I didn't believe it from the get go.  Not believable.  Then this author tries to make me believe that Reacher comes into town and solves all the murder cases within a two day period?  With all the information that was already available to law enforcement all the time?  No.<br /><br />This story takes place in 1997, not in the dark ages.  It is absolutely a slap in the face to make the statement that the state of Mississippi had no forensics departments which would have helped with these cases.  If this county did not have a coroner for proper investigation of a body, the victim would have been sent to a facility which could do proper examinations.  Once again, this author wanted me to believe none of this assistance was utilized by this sheriff.  No.  I think Child simply made a very poor choice of states to set the secret military base in because this particular state is under intense scrutiny for anything approaching racial problems and this situation would have had State and Federal boots on the ground in a heartbeat.<br /><br />I live close to where this story is supposed to take place, it is all completely fictional of course.  But, any real town of this size has characteristics which are universal.  There is simply no way that anyone could live in a community that small and retain any type of secret life.  Every resident knows every other resident or knows somebody else who does.  Once again, the author wanted me to believe a woman could move into a completely isolated, tiny community, not on the outskirts but in the town, and yet successfully refuse to divulge any information about her background?  For three years?  No, not going to happen.  Even in the dark ages of 1997 in rural Mississippi there were ways for people to find out whatever they wanted to know about someone.  This super secret military base's existence and function was figured out by all the locals, the information about one of the victims would have been also.  No, it didn't work.<br /><br />If it hadn't been for the areas I had issues with I would have thoroughly enjoyed this novel.  I will admit that I had not noticed in other novels this much emphasis and time being spent on Reacher having sex.  That seemed excessive to me and if it was meant as a means of fixing the idea in my mind of the power and force behind the passage of the train through the town, well I already understand the force of a train movingat 60 mph.  Thanks, but I didn't need help with that.at 60 mph.  Thanks, but I didn't need help with that.

B004J5366M|5.0|I had the good fortune to \\"discover\\" this wonderful artist at a folk concert outside Dublin earlier this year. His haunting and powerful performance blew me and the audience away. But the riveting live performance was only the appetizer for the main course: McMorrow's magnificant album \\"Early In The Morning.\\" Think early Neil Young, only better. McMorrow's tenor is haunting and the songs are power and beauty combined. The haunting and stirring \\"Walk in the Woods,\\" for example, has to be heard to be believed.<br /><br />This is a beautiful, powerful album by a great artist.
B001DJ7PQ4|5.0|The fourth series is definitely one of my favorites - I think the new series just got better with time. I'll admit, part of why I like it so much is because I thought it was a breath of fresh air just to have a companion who wasn't in love with the Doctor. But I love Donna for her own merits too - she's funny and snarky and not willing to put up with any crap. Tennant remains one of my favorite Doctors, and the fourth series has some of my favorite episodes of his(right before his downward spiral into depression and angst, which I did NOT like): Planet of the Ood and Silence in the Library/Forest of the Dead, which are fantastic. The only part of it I don't like is the end of the finale, which, not to spoil anything, I thought was wrong and cruel. Overall, though, I love this one.
B000A0GP4K|4.0|I'll confess--I don't like Bob Dylan. I've never liked his voice, nor his sense of humor, nor have I particularly liked his songs. He's always seems brutally disinterested in the feelings of anyone else. The last few days, I've been watching the Martin Scorsese documentary, No Direction Home, and tried to disarm my bad feelings of this guy with a deeper understanding of his psyche. Maybe it sounds obnoxious and prideful, but I don't like not liking somebody. I feel that if I just knew a person, comprehended them, that my mind would fall into line, and I'd develop--what's that word we hate so much?--compassion.<br /><br />So I watched Scorsese's 2005 story of Bob Dylan's first 25 years. He was born Robert Zimmerman, you probably know, in Northern Minnesota, not far from Lake Superior. It was coal country, and a small town environment without much to do. Only once does he mention his father in the movie; he never mentions his mother. Later in his career, he made much ado of the fact that he \\"grew up in Gallup New Mexico,\\" which was a blatant lie, as if he were trying to distance himself from his pedestrian, middle-class lifestyle. During high school, Dylan played guitar or piano in local bands, for a while with 50s teen idol Bobby Vee. During those years, he would often introduce himself as Bobby Vee himself, in an attempt to--I don't know what--gain popularity by proxy? To attract girls? To impress peers?<br /><br />From there, he went for a year to University of Minnesota, where he admits \\"I never attended classes. I was enrolled. But I don't remember going to class. I would play music all night, and sleep all day.\\" Eventually, he found his way to New York City's Greenwich Village, which had a flourishing arts and music scene. He never lacked work. He met (or at least claimed he met) Woodie Guthrie, who was at Greystone Hospital, an asylum.<br /><br />Those who knew him during the era claim he was a kind of musical sponge, quickly picking up genres, tunes, songs, even instrumental styles. He often imitated others; sometimes sang with an Irish accent; sometimes with a Southern US twang. He would do whatever it took to sell the song. Later, when he was enough of a name to sell records, his producers and label managers say he would con anybody with any kind of line, to make himself stand out from the crowd: \\"I learned this song from an Indian chief up in Ontario.\\" His self-promotion was unabashed.<br /><br />As I watched, the opening line of Allen Ginsberg's poem \\"Howl\\" kept running through my head: \\"I saw the best minds of my generation destroyed by madness.\\" Was this Dylan guy sane? He had no center: he admitted no parents, no past, except the one he invented for convenience's sake. If nothing else, he had chutzpah. Maybe that's a working definition of madness: someone with enough of a mental condition that they'll go after what they want, no matter the cost. If you throw enough mad people at the institution, one or two are bound to get through. We call those mad people geniuses. Just a thought.<br /><br />His treatment of folk singer Joan Baez was opportunistic and, as soon as she'd outlived her usefulness--she was quite popular--he very pointedly and publicly ignored her, until she was left no choice but to leave him, so he would continue his tour alone. She mentions seeing him, many times, turn his back on an audience for a song or two, or stop playing, even during a duet. This I found most unconscionable since a performance, like it or not, is a kind of social contract with minimal expectations. The audience has an expectation--I'd go so far as to say a right--to see the show they came to see.<br /><br />The record producers interviewed during the show seemed to take the attitude that, to paraphrase, was \\"Sure he lied to everyone, but look at all the money he made us.\\" As if that justifies such a behavior. I suppose it takes a sort of madness to attain fame, even more to attain money. Scorsese's film is aptly named; comingfrom a line in Dylan's hit \\"Like a Rolling Stone.\\" But, I wonder if he had no direction home, because Dylan himself removed home from the equation. To become someone, he seemed to think he had first to become everybody, and then nobody.<br /><br />Everyone who worked with him admits his genius. Sometimes it seems that genius is not enough to make up for lack of talent, especially when bolstered with conceit, and public rudeness. It is made obvious, in the second half of the film, that Dylan was completely unprepared for the effects \\"going electric\\" would have on him. Once the golden child, it became commonplace for 1/3 of the audience to boo him. The film ends with an interview clip with Dylan, who is clearly stoned, but is rocking uncontrollably in a chair, cigarette in hand saying \\"I don't know where home is, but I just want to go home.\\" He goes on stage, quips to the band that he wishes he could replace himself with another Dylan and that he \\"shouldn't be playing tonight.\\" He opens the stage door and is greeted by an attendee shouting \\"Judas!\\" as he plugs in his guitar.<br /><br />You can't help feel from him. Even a guy like myself, who went into the film to find more reasons to hate the singer. If that was my initial demands, I left the film satisfied. Yet a came away from the film with something else, for once: compassion. Nobody deserves to be treated the way he was, and for something simultaneously so nonessential and so important as music.nder if he had no direction home, because Dylan himself removed home from the equation.

I have every DTB CD and listen to those boys a lot - so I figured, oh great, Derek is touring and playing with the wifey, must be a blend of some great blues, since their passion is behind it, right? WRONG. Where are those powerful guitar licks that make my toes curl? Where's that driving percussion? Where's that raunchy, raspy, raw vocal? Not here boys and girls. If you're looking for some non-confrontational lullabies to drift off to sleep to, then this is the CD for you.

It challenges men to step up and claim their role as leader and provider, protector and defender of their families.  It encourages men to reach out and meet the needs of the fatherless child near them.  It is heart-wrenching and hilarious at the same time.
B000MNP2KI|2.0|After 2 attempts to watch this installment of the new James Bond movie, I had to shut it off. 45 minutes into the film and I still don't know the plot. I was unable to figure out if Bond was on a new mission and if he was, what was it? Who are the villains and what did they do? Very poor plot and character development. Granted, the first chase scene between Bond and whoever that guy with the knapsack was, did hold my attention. The standard Bond scene at the card table was horrible and the seduction of the bad guys wife was laughable. This guy couldn't shine Sean Connery's shoes. Pierce Brosnan was better.   My 2 stars for this film is based on the action stunts.
1402210086|5.0|I was introduced to Georgette Heyer after a recommendation from Amazon, and an opportunity to read the Grand Sophy for free on my Kindle.  I loved The Grand Sophy, and quickly decided I would read as many of Heyer's novels as I could this summer.  I read this after reading The Grand Sophy, and initially I was a little thrown off - the heroine was rather selfish, and it was hard for me to understand her attraction to the traditional regency romance hero, the rake.  This also threw me off, as the rake character is typically charming or has some like-able trait, however I quickly grew to HATE Jack Westruther. There was a point in the book where I considered putting it down, as I was sure the ending was going to disappoint me. However, the other characters in the book were vastly entertaining and enjoyable because of, or despite of, their faults (never has a conceited character like Freddy been as endearing), so I continued.  Thank God I did, because it ended just as it ought too, which was surprising to me when I realized it would.  Now, after I finished, I simply thought that it was a good book and continued on with the next Heyer novel, not feeling like it was the best.  Now, after having read at least 10-15 of her books, I keep getting drawn back to this one, and how funny it really is... I don't read books twice very often, but this is one I'll be reading again.

I was hoping that a really cool one would be available for Christmas. There's actually a really cool one on another Amazon site (I think it's in France or something) that has a wand and everything with it. I thought we'd get something similar in North America, but apparently not! :(

B002HJ9PTO|2.0|The cord was kind of unmanageably long, and when I clipped it on subjects the clip itself was kind of heavy so if they didn't have a strong lapel or something, it was hard to get it in the right spot that I wanted it. Other than that it seems to work ok, however I didn't really notice that it worked particularly awesome. So it's probably good for the price, but if you really need something like this that works well you might need to spring for the more expensive ones.
B004ZN9W5M|3.0|This is a great album that should be in everyone's collection, but Pink Floyd fans and audiophiles hoping for a significant boost in the sound quality of this most recent remaster may as well save their money and stick with whatever they've already got.  As an owner of the original vinyl release, I always felt the the sound quality of the album left something to be desired. Especially since it came out in 1979; when the sound quality of a record, properly mixed and mastered, was pretty darn good, e.g. the Clash's \\"London Calling.\\"  The first CD version of the album also had a dim and flat sound. That is still the case with this 2011 remaster, which I think has a muddier sound than the 1994 copyright Capitol/Harvest CD (the most recent, and best, version of the album I've heard prior to this).   The sound of the 2011 release reminds me of a well-worn vinyl record, minus the crackles and pops. Perhaps that's the throwback feel they're going for with this remaster -- but I was hoping for an improved and more dynamic sound ....
0525423281|5.0|Roller coaster.<br /><br />Have you ever been on one? You know that feeling that you get when you are going up ...up ...up and your heart is pounding and you're gripping the bar in front of you, like it's actually holding you in? Then you reach the pinnacle and there is like this moment where you feel like you are on top of the world --all flailyswoony--and weightless before the car takes a turn and then nose-dives, causing your heart to leap up into your throat and making you feel almost sick?<br /><br />That's what this story is: a roller coaster.<br /><br />You all already know that Stephanie Perkins is an amazing author. Amazing is an understatement--she nails the emotions and swoons and heartbreak every single time. So I don't have to tell you that. What I will tell you is that the characters are amazing, from Lola (and of course the boy next door) to the dads to the twin to even little Abigail, the adorable niece. They are rich and multi-faceted and real, and I love that about them. Lola is quirky and fun. Max is swoonworthy in his own right (until he's totally, totally not), and don't even get me started on Cricket. omg--the hair. the socks. the blue sugar on his lips. the bracelets. *flails* the bracelets.<br /><br />Did I mention &Eacute;tienne? He's there--happily, blissfully in love with Anna. And I love Stephanie Perkins for that, even more than I did before, which is a lot. For giving me more of him. And them. And their kisses.<br /><br />I do have to mention here that contrary to so many of my friends, I did not love Lola like I loved Anna and the French Kiss. But come on, I'm totally in love with &Eacute;tienne. And Stephanie Perkins said she's giving him to me. So do you really expect anything else?<br /><br />Without giving away anything more than I already have (esp with my status updates), I did feel like Lola took a little too long to get it together, but I have to account for the fact that the girl is only 17 and that there are other circumstances to consider for her lack of decisiveness. But when it's all said and done, Lola and the Boy Next Door has everything--it's funny, it's heartbreaking, it's romantic, it's soooo hot that you'll melt into a pile of smoldering goo, and it's about time you read it!done, Lola and the Boy Next Door has everything--it's funny, it's heartbreaking, it's romantic, it's soooo hot that you'll melt into a pile of smoldering goo, and it's about time you read it!
B005G4TJI4|3.0|I bought this to keep my collection of Transformer movies intact.  I found the setup for the plot a little slow going.  I rate this as the third in the series should be rated.  The fantasy is a little too  fantastical.  The action not quite up to snuff.  The new girlfriend has the eye candy on her side, but the mystique is missing.  The returning characters did their part in upholding the imagination of the film.  I did not see this in the theater, thank goodness.  It is worth watching again but not one for the ages.
B005OT2YVA|1.0|Being curious about the current 'state of the arts in Hollywood' is possibly an acceptable reason for viewing this grueling 2 1/2 hour + mechanical mishmash, but after enduring the storyless CGI exercise in visual and auditory assault the viewer can only hope that in the theaters, with the added dimension of 3D to the soup, the film might have had some saving graces.<br /><br />Apparently the 'story' goes something like this (at least in a neutral writer's words): 'Autobots Bummblebee, Rachet, Ironhide and Sideswipe led by Optimus Prime, are back in action taking on the evil Decepticons, who are eager to avenge their recent defeat. The Autobots and Decepticons become involved in a perilous space race between the U.S. and Russia, to reach a hidden Cybertronian spacecraft on the moon and learn its secrets, and once again Sam Witwicky has to come to the aid of his robot friends. New villain, Shockwave, who rules Cybertron, is on the scene while the Autobots and Decepticons continue to battle it out on Earth.' In other words this is an action film where the main characters are expanding and imploding auto parts in some semblance of a battle for taking over the earth.  What little dialogue there is was written by Ehren Kruger and the comic book cum video game cum 3D epic was 'directed' by Michael Bay.<br /><br />Given that the film did so well in the theaters (likely due to the novelty of 3D) it made a lot of money.  The cast assembled is an admirable one: Shia LaBeouf, Josh Duhamel, John Turturro, Tyrese Gibson, Patrick Dempsey, Frances McDormand, John Malkovich (for his brief few seconds on screen), Ken Takemoto ,  and the voices of the mechanical dolls supplied by such actors as Hugo Weaving, Frank Welker, Leonard Nimoy,  Robert Foxworth,  James Remar, and Francesco Quinn.  The problem is that there is so much destruction of the city of Chicago and the flying pieces of the fighting Autobots and Decepticons that finding a story and caring about the non-mechanical actors is tough.  But then this is what the public is spending money to see so it is obvious why Hollywood is making movies like this.  Could there possibly be another installment coming?  Probably..... A must miss award to TRANSFORMERS: DARK OF THE MOON.  Grady Harp, October 11n this is what the public is spending money to see so it is obvious why Hollywood is making movies like this.

B005GYY0GA|4.0|Heard Johnny Winter, \\"A Blues Legend\\" interviewed on NPR this morning. Interesting interview that featured a couple of tracks from his new 'Roots' CD. The Podcast can be found on the NPR website BTW. Billboard has a nice writeup on the album also that they did a couple of months ago. Needless to say I headed to amazon to see if this new album was available for mp3 download.  My favorite tracks from this album are Got My Mojo Workin', Last Night and Honky Tonk. Good job Johnny!
0756404738|5.0|I never saw the book, since I sent it to my friend. And I didn't read it since it wasn't for me. But I did ask her about the quality of the book and she was really happy, also the billing, shipping and handling was good and fast, so nothing went wrong. Regards.
1572703253|5.0|This is a well-written story, with an interesting but not overwhelmingly intricate plot line, and it is really enhanced by Stephanie Cole's reading.  Her voices for the characters are different enough so that you know who's speaking, but not at all overdone.  It's quite amazing that she can believably personify so many characters of varying ages, genders, and classes.    As for the story, it is classic Christie.  Even though it takes place in a very different world from the present one, you care about the characters and what they're going through.  It's always fun to guess at the murderer as the story goes along, but Christie once again manages to come up with a surprising ending.    Excellent entertainment!
0553801473|5.0|Let's get the main criticism out of the way - yes, yes, \\"A Dance With Dragons\\" in many respects is far too long and far too slow.  This book is not nearly as taut as George R. R. Martin's magnificent \\"A Game of Thrones,\\" but instead is eerily reminiscent of the half-baked-yet-1200-pages-long draft that Michael Douglas is working on at the beginning of \\"Wonder Boys.\\"  I often felt like his insightful student who reluctantly tells Douglas, \\"Sure, it's beautifully written, but it's like you didn't have the courage to make any choices.\\"<br /><br />But here's the thing.  Now that he's into the fifth book of \\"A Song of Ice and Fire,\\" Martin has realized that he's created a unique, fully realized world that has a dizzying cast of characters.  Unlike Tolkien (the inevitable comparison once again rears its ugly head), Martin has decided to put everything into this series - he's not going to finish these seven books and then unleash a Silmarillion-like collection of back stories and supporting myths.  He's created this world, by gum, and he's going to let us wallow in its glorious, bloody miseries and triumphs.<br /><br />And wallow we do.  The first two thirds of the book bring back some favorite characters who were frustratingly absent from Book 4, \\"A Feast For Crows.\\"  Tyrion Lannister flees to the East after murdering his father at the end of Book 3, \\"A Storm of Swords.\\"  Ever the plotter, Tyrion aims to join forces with Daenerys Targaryen, the dragon queen whose dreams of reconquering Westeros are thwarted by the troubles she's made for herself in Meereen after freeing the slaves.  Daenerys must also confront the harsh fact that her beloved three dragons are not responding well to city life.  Daenerys faces innumerable political challenges in a world where political issues are often solved with blood or poison.  Jon Snow still commands the Watch at the Wall, but faces his own mess of devil's choices.  Bran Stark continues his journey toward becoming a mystical seer.  Theon Greyjoy endures the harshest of tortures at the hands of Ramsay Bolton but at Winterfell must maintain an obvious lie for political purposes.  Arya Stark stays on the path to assassinhood in Braavos . . . and on and on.  The last third of the novel reconnects with the action in the South as we get brief glimpes through the eyes of Jaime, Cersei, and Kevan Lannister and a few others.<br /><br />At the end of the novel, \\"A Song of Ice and Fire\\" is teed up for some mighty clashes and high-stakes political wheeling and dealing.  Could Martin have written a much shorter book to get to the same point?  Of course he could have.  But the point is, \\"A Song of Ice and Fire\\" is an epic story, perhaps the most epic in the history of high fantasy.  He is not writing books that can be easily enjoyed on an airplane flight and then discarded.  These are books that are meant to be savoured and devoured.  My perfect \\"ASOIAF\\" reading experience would most likely involve a quiet room with massive maps on my walls and a character compendium at my side so I could refresh my recollection as to just who the heck the Martells are, or the role of the Sand Snakes, and why the Boltons and Tullys matter.  I haven't forgotten these details because these folks aren't interesting - it's just they've been off-stage for too long.  For me, that's a strength of Martin's books, not a weakness.<br /><br />Eventually, this epic will be so vast that anyone who can keep it all straight should receive an honorary PhD.  We need more series like this, but I fear that Martin's creation is a once-in-a-generation affair.

B005DKLPF6|4.0|On their fifth album Mastodon have created their most streamlined, rock-oriented offering yet, veering away from the conceptual masterwork and dazzling prog metal of their critically acclaimed Crack The Skye album.  Despite the more straight forward approach and accessible song-writing, The Hunter maintains the hefty weight and stellar craftsmanship that has defined their career.    Typically robust opener `Black Tongue' could fit snugly on Blood Mountain or Crack the Skye, capped off with an elegantly melodic guitar solo.  \\"Curl of the Burl' is likely to raise eyebrows and polarise fans.  This is the most accessible song the band has written, following a fairly standard rock structure, stripping back the sludgy weight and delivering a catchy stoner rock anthem.  Guitarist Brett Hinds' melodic vocal delivery continues to improve, contrasting with the hoarse vocals of Troy Sanders. `Dry Bone Valley' and 'All the Heavy Lifting' are particularly memorable from a vocal and musical standpoint.  The only misstep is the bizarre `Creature Lives'; a forgettable, drawn-out experiment that fits awkwardly with the album.  This is rectified by the stunning trio of songs that round out The Hunter; the sonic power of \\"Spectrelight', tricky rhythms of `Bedazzled Fingernails' and melodic sensibilities of `The Sparrow'.  The Hunter is a taut collection of addictive rock songs and the sludgy, unique metal of a band in continuous creative upswing.

0525948023|5.0|I got a lot out of this. I loved it. I listened to the book on CDs rather than read it and that was an important aspect of my enjoyment. Backtracking, I tried to read his seminal work, The Power of Now, and through no fault of the author or book, I could not get through it,  because it was such an intense read for me. It gave me \\"cause for pause\\" and I would read one page, and have to put the book down to contemplate it, after a few days of that, I abandoned the book. I chose to listen to A New Earth CD when looking for something to listen to on my car CD player, while I was a captive audience on my long and daily commute to work in heavy traffic. I loved it from the first CD. I enjoyed listening to the author read, and the concepts were timely for me. At the time, I did not realize this was one of Oprah's picks, but I understand why it is. I'm not a celebrity groupie by any definition, but she works to use her influence to benefit a lot of people and that is admirable.  Eckhart Tolle's A New Earth is gentle and thought provoking, and he also motivated me. I feel that as a result of listening to A New Earth all week, I have tried to be a better person (ie; less ego-attached and ego-driven and more accepting of the present moment whatever it may be) than usual. This CD set of A New Earth has given me an enjoyable week of commuting. I've passed it on to a friend, and I'll be curious to hear what her impressions are. After that, my husband, hopefully, will give it a listen. While listening, I could accept the book at face value and did not feel compelled to argue with it. There are a lot of messengers out there, true. There's a lot of good deliveries along the lines of this message, but I feel he makes things relevant for people today and I appreciate this book a lot for now.

B004LWZW24|3.0|I had heard good things about Insidious which led me to this purchase.  Atmospherically, the movie is eerie which is fantastic.  It's that feeling you get when you are all alone in your house and the house keeps making weird noises and you get sort of paranoid.  Basically, the movie is about a family with three kids that are living in a house which they believe is haunted.  Things just escalate and one of the little boys goes into an unexplainable coma.  They move, thinking the house carried the evil, but actually they carry it with them when they go.  As time goes on, and the little boy stays comatose, the family invites a couple of goofy investigators in and a hardcore psychic.  It seems the little boy is able to astrally project himself during sleep so his soul separates from his body.  At some point, the two did not connect again and his soul is out there somewhere floating around while his body is pretty much empty.  The empty body is a breeding ground for evil things that are looking to take it over, namely a red-faced demon that likes to terrorize.  The astral projection also has a link to the boys father and it becomes a quest to save the little kid's soul.  My honest opinion is that this was a new idea, which is always good in horror.  Something different to be seen rather than the same old song and dance.  However, it got so out of control and ridiculous that it fell apart.  At first the demons slam doors and mess with a baby monitor and you see glimpses of them like behind a drape for instance.  But then it just turned silly and the demon was like a small boy who ran around and the story just lost its atmosphere so quickly.  Once you see like a solid figure and hear these obviously clear voices, it just takes on that Hollywood appearance again and the subtleties that made it creepy start to suffer.  Also, the outlandish investigators and the psychic with this gas mask looking thing did not help the movie at all.  Please, one of the guys had this contraption that looked like a scope at a proctologists office and he was inserting Viewmaster cartridges into it. Dumb. The first half is so promising - it was really creepy to me when the little boy Dalton was being taken care of at home and you could here that monitor beeping in the dark - I kept expecting him to half raise out of bed and look up with black eyes or something.  I felt really sorry for little Logan who obviously saw the things creeping around the house at night.  I was kind of hoping the demon was going to take that cranky little girl who kept crying every seven seconds.  She was giving me a headache.  Anyway, I just wish they could have redone this film and stuck with their original ideal of using old school atmosphere to scare the Bejesus out of people.  Once you are lost on this movie, you are lost and it becomes boring.  You could rent it if you are curious, but I certainly would not spend my money on it any further than that.
B0052VUNHC|5.0|This book was recommended on one of the threads on Amazon, and they did not lie when they said this book was awesome. I loved it.  I was completely hooked from the first page.  I stayed up way to late to finish it, but didn't care.  All I can say is I WANT MORE.
0316134082|1.0|A gift from a well meaning relative who clearly didn't hear me rant about this book enough the first time around. Despite the horrific prose, fanfiction plot and Meyer's inability to string more than two sentences together without harping on about how pale and perfect Edward is, while clearly oblivious to the fact that he's the poster boy for domestic abuse, I was still expecting something more from this edition. Like, oh, I don't know, editing.  Sadly it's just another go at milking the cash cow, just like the collectors editions I spotted recently with the white covers.  Nothing new, nothing exclusive, nothing worth spending your cash on. Just the same (awful) book as before, but this time in a box.
B003TXKSWU|5.0|I am neither a John Legend Fan or a Roots Fan, but this album may get me to listen to other work that both have done.  This soulful protest music, largely drawn from African American artists in the late 1960s through the early 1970s, is fantastic.  It has the classic soul music sound while updating it with new arrangements and commentary in the form of hip hop lyrics.  It has all the classic elements of soul music sounds while simultaneously conveying old lessons as they apply to our times and universal truths.  John Legend has a great sound here, and has really expanded his style from crooner into a man ready to push barriers to make a more meaningful and important music. Questlove and the Roots musical selections, arrangements, and playing are both respectful of the tradition while updating the sound for the modern listeners.  They play with musicality and soul.  If you appreciate great music that is both entertaining while challenging, this is your album.    I bought this on Vinyl with fantastic well designed packaging, a full double album photograph in the interior of the band, and vinyl record dust cases with commentary and descriptions of the tunes.  I was surprised both by the quality of the recording, the packaging, and the art.  I will also admit, that I believe most things sound better on Vinyl.  Clearly a labor of love by Mr. Legend and the Roots, it is packaged for a long shelf life.  This album is a must have if you simply love music.  It gets  better every time I spin the record.  I would suggest buying the Vinyl.  It is worth the money.

B005NQAPTC|4.0|DUETS II, the highly-anticipated follow up to [[ASIN:B000H0MKGU Duets: An American Classic]], features Tony Bennett in grand style for his 85th birthday.  This album is even better than its predecessor.  Much like Fred Astaire, Tony makes his partners look good.  Even the excreable Lady Gaga sounds good on \\"The Lady is a Tramp\\" (a VERY appropriate track as far as Miss G. is concerned).  The poignant version of \\"Body and Soul\\" proved to be the late Amy Winehouse's last recording; you can hear the damage in her voice.  This special edition includes bonus duets by \\"America's Got Talent\\" star Jackie Evancho and country star Brad Paisley.  It also has some downloadable content, but requires the latest and greatest browsers to access it, which are not available on public computers.  I am taking off one star, despite the album's excellence, because of Tony's incredibly stupid \\"9-11 truther\\" comments on the Howard Stern show.  As a member of the Greatest Generation, you should know better, Tony!  To his credit, he did apologize, but that was probably a CYA move instigated by Sony Music, his record label.  Happy 85th, Tony, but watch your tongue next time!

B002I0J5FG|1.0|Ugh.  Talk about ruining a cherished gaming experience.  I played Ico years ago on PS2 and absolutely adored it.  When Sony announced this remastered bundle for PS3, I was ecstatic.  As soon as I got it, I loaded it up, started Ico, and fell in love with it all over again.  I freed the mysterious Yorda from her cage, held her hand as we stumbled through the castle together, fought off the shadow creatures that kept trying to snatch her away.  And I had an absolute blast doing it all again.  Then I got to the water wheel.  Apparently this is not exactly the same Ico I played all those years ago.  This is the European version, which has a few changes from what North American gamers experienced, the most noticeable of which is an infuriating segment where players have to get Ico to jump onto a rotating water wheel, and from there to a metal bar.  I wasted almost an hour of my life trying and failing at this, and I'm now convinced it's impossible.  Oh, I've read forum posts from equally frustrated players who claim to have finally done it, but I just don't see how.  If I jump too soon, Ico doesn't catch the side of the wheel, and falls in the water.  If I jump too late, by the time Ico climbs up onto the wheel, it's rotated too far for him to keep his footing and make the second leap, and he... falls in the water.  Any other possible outcome eludes me.  There does not appear to be a \\"just right\\" time to jump.  Over and over I tried, again and again.  Climb up, wait, jump, miss, fall.  Climb up, wait, jump, miss, fall.  Never any progress to give me any hope of success.  Never any indication that I'm evem on the right track.  Heck, I had to search for a walkthrough just to make sure I wasn't missing something else I should have been doing instead.     This single moment has managed to drain away all enjoyment of Ico, and has permanently soiled my memories of this once-beloved classic.  I no longer have any desire to play it ever again.  My advice to North American players is to boycott this until Sony releases a patch that either fixes the impossible timing, or reverts the game back to the way we remember it.  My own copy is going back to the store for a refund.  I didn't even try Shadow of the Colossus.  One spoiled experience is quite enough.

1419702203|4.0|A magnificent book, full of absolutely incredible photos that were never intended for public consumption. Kudos to Olivia Harrison for doing this - it has to be one of THE major Beatles-related books alongside their own 'Anthology' and Mark Lewisohn's body of work on the group, including his forthcoming multi-volume bio. That having been said, 'Living in the Material World' is not without its flaws: many of the captions are weak - yes, the photos largely speak for themselves, but with expert input there could have been more precise dating and, in certain cases, useful observations and background info. (Just one of many examples is a terrific 1963 side-on stage shot of the band that includes the back of someone watching quietly from the wings. What many readers possibly won't realize, and what makes this photo all the more significant, is that the man is their devoted road manager Neil Aspinall who would later run their company, Apple. It would have been worthwhile pointing this out, along with numerous other helpful tidbits.) Also, conspicuous by her omission is George's first wife Pattie, who was by his side during the most eventful decade of his life. The one group photo in which she does appear has her listed as Pattie Boyd at a time when she was Pattie Harrison. That, however, is it as far as she's concerned. Even a close-up portrait of George at their Kinfauns home that was almost certainly taken by Pattie is credited only to the \\"Harrison family.\\" Her absence cannot have been a mere oversight; more likely, it speaks to bad blood between the two wives, which is unfortunate since it results in a major aspect of George's life being excluded from this otherwise comprehensive, beautifully produced and truly outstanding book.
B0058EBNAO|5.0|This is one classy app! Very nice visual features along with METARs for us pilots is an excellent bonus. It's too bad that so many people are giving poor reviews for things that are beyond the control of the developers. In particular, the quality of a forecast is not the developer's fault. For that, you need to strike up a discussion with the actual weather providers. All the developer's are doing is pulling this data from these other sources. As far as \\"it doesn't work\\" issues, I'm hard pressed to put much faith when these people can't even bother to note what their hardware is so that the developer's can attempt to resolve the issues. As a developer (but one with absolutely no ties to Elecont) it's disappointing to read \\"it doesn't work\\" over and over, but not bothering with anything more than that. These developers seem intent on fixing and upgrading the app, but can't do it without some help.

B005CM9DX6|5.0|As a long time fan of the band, I'm not going to compare this album to the prior metal releases (which I love), and then explain how the differences from much of the band's previous heavier work are a problem.  I am reviewing the album on its own merits.<br /><br />I think it is excellent.  I really like this new sound.  I will agree with some of the other reviewers in that at first blush there aren't any true standout songs or that the album as a whole and certain individual song structures seem to lack direction.  After the first few listens, I think those criticisms are fair.  This more experimental, progressive album requires more from the listener.<br /><br />After taking some time to listen to this thing, I find that all of the songs are solid - this is an album that can be listened to  cover-to-cover.  After at least a dozen listens certain tracks (and passages within them) have stood out and become favorites: \\"I Feel the Dark\\", \\"Haxprocess\\", \\"The Lines in My Hand\\", \\"Folklore\\", \\"Famine\\", and the closing instrumental \\"The Marrow of the Earth\\".  My initial favorite cut would have to be \\"Folklore\\", and, I might add that \\"The Marrow of the Earth\\" would be at home on the Floyd's often overlooked classic \\"Obscured by Clouds\\".  The 2 bonus songs on the DVD, \\"Pyre\\" and \\"Face in the Snow\\" are also of high quality.  \\"Face in the Snow\\", a beautiful acoustic piece, is of particular note, and could be my favorite song on the album.<br /><br />The album is very well done, well-produced, and uses lots of older instruments & equipment for a sort of \\"modern retro\\" sound, if that description makes sense.  As usual, there are the proggy time changes and careful use of electronic effects, jazzy sections, folky sections, bluesy influences, and lush layering.  There just isn't much metal.<br /><br />In the DVD that comes with the special edition, Mikael explains his approach to the album, the equipment that was used, and why he decided to go this route.  I am a little concerned, after watching the \\"Making of Heritage\\" DVD, that the change may be semi-permanent to permanent.  I would dearly miss Mikael's peerless death vocal, if that happens to be true....<br /><br />But for now, I am quite pleased with this latest Opeth release.  The metal purists probably won't dig it (fair enough), but for the others:  Recommended.  Enjoy!
B003TOPQI0|1.0|I am a fan of Jason Statham, but wow, he has several real snoozers. I watched this plus Luck # Slevin, and I'm not sure which one made me sleep more.

B0050PYNP8|4.0|Pegg and Frost return with a new buddy SciFi movie that was described as a love letter to Spielberg. In fact, Spielberg's voice makes a cameo when talking with the wise cracking alien, Paul, but I get ahead of myself. Tale focuses on two UK nerds who travel to Comic Con and then decide upon a road trip to see Area 51. After speaking with the chatty waitress near Area 51 (played by Jane Lynch) they stumble upon an alien named Paul who they help escape from the bad Feds and during that time Paul teaches them about coolness and even gets one of them a girlfriend. It's a nerd fantasy come true and yes there's nerd humor all over the place and nods to several SciFi movies, especially E.T. SciFi fans who want a good laugh will enjoy this film. Sigourney Weaver plays \\"The Big Guy\\". Jason Bateman plays the gray ally. CHARACTERS/DIALOGUE: B; STORY/PLOTTING: B; NERD HUMOR: B plus to A minus; OVERALL GRADE: B to B plus; WHEN WATCHED: August 2011.
B002I0J5FG|5.0|Two masterpieces from the PS2 era remastered in HD.  I don't know what else to say about these games that most people don't already know.  I had already played SotC prior to buying this, but I played ICO for the first time and fell in love with it.  These are truly one-of-a-kind experiences.  Throw in trophy support (2 platinums!), 3D support, 2 dynamic themes, and brand new interviews with Ueda-san and company, this is an absolute steal for $40.  I always thought that the Sony HD collections were way better than other third party collections, and this one is no exception.
0312430000|4.0|I found the author's stories entertaining and valuable.  I was shocked to discover that surgeons generally do not use checklists.  Maybe that's because their life is not on the line, only their patient's life!  I now have a new question to ask before I go under the knife. Instead of show me CarFax, I'll be asking them to show me the checklist!
1609611543|5.0|Wheat Belly explains the necessity of eliminating wheat from our diet in order to lose weight.  Dr. Davis also shows strong relationships between modern wheat consumption and several diseases, including heart disease, osteoporosis, diabetes, cancer, inflammation of knee and hip joints, dementia, as well as obesity.  From this book, I learned about the ineffectiveness of calcium supplements, the truth about whole wheat and its propensity for raising insulin and fat storage, the importance of having a slightly alkaline balance in the body, and so much more.  The book is filled with anecdotal accounts, practical suggestions, and even includes some simple recipes.  I would recommend this book to anyone who has difficulty shedding pounds, as well as those with other health issues.
B004E2XAFW|5.0|There is not a bad or boring song on this album. At first look it seems like a pretentious concept album, but the songs are well written, well sung, and well produced. The DVD video is also high quality, almost like a short movie in itself. The videos themselves are cinematic quality.   I really thought \\"Heart Of Everything\\" would be their peak, but this bird is still flying.
0385528752|5.0|This book is about making change, in your personal life, in companies, and even at the national level. Moreover, this is one of the few books in the self-improvement kind of genre that is based upon a plethora of research, which the Heath brothers describe throughout the book. Giving examples of the actual studies makes the points more clear and drives home additional insights. Although I am well-read in self-improvement books, this one contains lots of new ideas and I also made some great insights into human behavior and change. Highly recommended.
1400069181|4.0|A business exists to solve a problem and the more effective it is, the more the company grows and prospers.  It's a simple formula, but this book tells you the story of going beyond just buying something for a dollar and selling it for two.<br /><br />Blake's story is an incredible one, if it's not outright inspirational.  Too many people go into business with simple priorities, sell a product (or service), make money, rinse and repeat.  Blake took a much deeper approach: solve a problem that others ignore and also create an opportunity to help those who are disadvantaged.  In doing so, he made a difference in the lives of so many people.  It is widely believed that entrepreneurs are only out to make money, but that does not have to be the case.  This story proves that with concrete examples of how it was done and how you can do it as well.<br /><br />My favorite chapter was \\"face your fears\\".  I think this is the most important lesson for anyone to learn, not only for those who want to succeed financially, but for every part of your life.  A famous man once said: \\"everything you want in life is just outside your comfort zone\\".
1400052181|5.0|When the author took a community college biology class in 1988, her professor was explaining cancer cells and he wrote the name Henrietta Lacks on the board. He explained that Henrietta died in 1951 of cervical cancer. But, before she died, a surgeon took samples of her tumor and put them in a petri dish. The professor then added on that Henrietta was a black woman. Rebecca became intrigued about who the woman was behind the cells. She spent the next several years researching the story of the cells and that of Henrietta and her family.  Henrietta was born in Roanoke, Virginia in 1920. When her mother died, she returned to her father's family tobacco farm in Clover, VA. The family had farmed the same land since their slave ancestors. She grew up with her older cousin David, Day, Lacks. He was 5 years older. At age 14, Henrietta became pregnant with Day's child and they married. They had 5 children. Day was always cheating on Henrietta and gave her various STD'S.  In 1951, after waiting a year, Henrietta went to John Hopkins Hospital to see a Doctor. She told them she had a knot in her womb. As the Dr. flipped through her chart from previous visits, he noted she had been diagnosed with neurosyphilis but had cancelled treatments. She had also tested positive for gonorrhea and increased cellular activity in the cervix. She had declined follow up treatment. Shortly after, Henrietta had given birth to a baby at the hospital yet, no tumor was detected at time of birth. Either it had been overlooked or it had grown that fast after 4 months. A sample of the tumor was taken and sent to pathology. When the Dr. began treatment on the tumor, he took samples of healthy tissue and the cancerous tissue. He then sent them to Dr. George Gey's lab. Gey was experimenting in growing cells from tissue. So far he was not having success in keeping cells alive. Henrietta's cells were different. They grew. He labeled his samples with the first two letters of the patient's first and last name. These cells are now known as HeLa cells.  HeLa cells with their unique properties became the cells to test every vaccine or procedure on. They were used to test the Salk vaccine for polio, radiation from a nuclear bomb, chemotherapy drugs, hormones, AIDS, deep sea diving and spaceflight. They were also infected with TB, salmonella and bacteria. It was later discovered that her cancer was caused by the HPV virus. HeLa cells became a researcher's dream. Factories were built to mass produce the cells. They were shipped all over the world, first freely by Dr. Gey, then for money by companies.  It wasn't until a Rolling Stone reporter showed up at the Lack's home in 1975, did the family find out that Henrietta's cells were still alive and being used for research. This had quite an effect on the family.  Now in the 1990's, Ms. Skloot goes back to the Rolling Stone article and follows the research into the Lack's family. It takes time and patience but through numerous interviews and gaining confidence with the Lack's family, they let her in. Through a timeline back and forth, which aids in keeping track of where the author is in the book, we learn the science of the cells, the family relations of Henrietta, the ethical questions it raises about using cells from a donor or in many cases, not a donor, and making money from them. Henrietta's family never saw a cent from the millions the cells have made for companies. They have lived in poverty with no health insurance. I believe the book is very fair in showing both sides. Without testing on tissues, organs, blood, etc. after we are done with them, either in surgery or through lab work, there would be no way to find new cures for diseases. Yet, here is a family who could have really needed some compensation. Maybe John Hopkins could have at the very least provided free health care to the family as a sigh of good will. That is just my opinion. In the past couple of years, new laws have been written to protect the privacy andrights of the patients. We are a more informed patient.
B0013FSL0C|5.0|I saw Series 2 and 3 on HBO, but never saw this first series. My wife and I love this show. It's enthralling, intense, and for intelligent adults only. This show is extremely well-written and directed. There are some odd fluctuations in picture quality, most noticeable in one couple's vignettes, almost as if they were filmed on a different (inferior) camera. For that matter, I preferred watching the show on HBO High def as opposed to DVD, but HBO does not seem to re-run this program. It was somewhat of a specialty show with narrower appeal than some other HBO productions.<br />  Highly recommended if you haven't seen it.
B0047S1KMS|1.0|My copy of Dead Set I got from Amazon had serious problems which I didn't deal with so that is my fault but wanted to pass along the info.  In the third, forth, and fifth episodes of the show there was serious picture dragging and skipping.  I tried it on 2 other DVD players and had the same result.  I got a 'copy' from a 'friend' and it was played perfect.  Amazon should really do some quality control on some of the things they sell.  As I said it was my fault for not dealing with it at the time but this is just to warn others...make sure it works and keep packing slip for returns.
0525423281|4.0|Stephanie Perkins knows how to make me smile!! She has a gift for writing humorous stories with one-of-kind characters. After I read and loved Anna and the French Kiss, I knew I had to get my hands on Lola and the Boy Next Door! I bought Lola and the Boy Next Door the day it came out, and I absolutely loved it!  Was this novel adorable? Definitely. Was it predictable? Yeah. Did I love every freaking minute of it? Totally!  Stephanie Perkins does it again with Lola and the Boy Next Door. I will admit that I missed the poetry and the slang from Anna and the French Kiss, but I really loved the characters and their hobbies in Lola and the Boy Next Door. You have a costume designer, an inventor, a future detective and an ice skater. Plus, all of the characters had eccentric and unique personalities. Lola is quirky and hilarious. She is the definition of one of a kind. She often wears a wig and a costume, and she refuses to wear anything twice. Cricket, the boy next door, is also a funky dresser. He's caring, lovable, energetic, a little awkward and kind of shy. Lindsey, Lola's best friend, is very focused on her academic agenda and refuses to date in high school. She's also obsessed with solving mysteries. Calliope was a little self-centered, but protective. We aren't even going to talk about Max. We will ignore Max. The characters really made this novel.  Did I mention there are several guest appearances from Anna and Etienne St. Clair? Oh yes, they pop up a lot throughout Lola and the Boy Next Door, which was awesome!  I also loved Lola's unconventional family. Her two dad's Andy and Nathan are loving and protective parents. They fully support her uniqueness and they encourage her to be true to herself.  Not only was this novel remarkably cute, but there were also a lot of great messages throughout this novel, such as: finding yourself, staying true to yourself, discovering if someone is the one, and the importance of trust.  I gave Lola and the Boy Next Door by Stephanie Perkins 4 STARS. This is an amazing story for young adults. It's hilarious and romantic. I strongly recommend this novel for anyone in search of a great Chick-Lit.   -XOXO  Reading, Eating & Dreaming  FOR MORE REVIEWS CHECK OUT MY BLOG ON BLOGSPOT: READING, EATING & DREAMING I WAS BLAIR WALDORF

B000000WJK|5.0|A Storm In Heaven is without a doubt one of the greatest, if not the greatest album to come out of Great Britain in the early 90's. By all means a sonic masterpiece. I would say this CD is a MUST HAVE if you are thinking about purchasing any of The Verve's music.

B002YOKVU4|3.0|This review is not about the movie, but about the BD release. And just in case there are multiple variants of it, my package has bar code 025192046131. I can't remember where I got my copy (not from amazon, that's for sure), but it has the same cover shown here on amazon, and the issues I have with this release are important enough that I thought it would help to write a review here as well.<br /><br />With this BD experience, I decided I will stay away from future BD acquisitions and stick to purchasing DVDs. Here's why: after a while, this BD will simply stop working. When I got it, I started playing it in a Visio player and all was great. But I couldn't watch it until the end, so I paused it and I adjourned the viewing. Next day, when I wanted to resume it, it wouldn't work - it basically gets stuck after selecting the English language, but before any preview is shown. Screen goes black, no message is shown, skipping or fast forwarding return the encouraging message that the operation is prohibited at the moment (great choice of words that every customer must want to hear, by the way), I can bring up player menus, but I can't change a thing, other than getting back to the player menu. I also have a Sony player, so I thought this might be a Visio player problem, so let me play it in the player of its makers - worked fine again, stopped it, restarted it and continued fine - alas, this was the last time it worked like this - third time I restarted the movie, it got stuck again like on the Visio. Now it doesn't play in either of them. I checked the disc surface and it's perfect - no scratches, dirt, fingerprints. Movie plays initially without any problems in a player, but then it's like it gets stuck and cannot be replayed. Both players I tried it on have the latest respective updates and they're recent models. Other BDs play just fine, so this is a release issue.<br /><br />Now, this self proclaimed \\"perfect hi def movie experience\\" has a \\"feature\\" called BD Live - I think it tries to connect somewhere maybe to get fresh previews (like that's what I purchased this item for) and I suspect that maybe that is what gets stuck. So I tried stopping my internet connection in the hope that it can achieve something - unfortunately it didn't change anything.<br /><br />I am now looking on the Internet searching for tips on this issue.<br /><br />The movie is great. Its subject matter may not be to everyone's taste, but that's another thing. I'll probably get it on DVD if I can't figure out a way to make the BD work again.<br /><br />[UPDATE 10/02/2011]: After digging through player menus, I found a BDLive category on the Visio player which allowed me to delete BDLive content and prohibit Internet access (feels good to be able to prohibit something for a change). On the Sony player, I had no such BDLive menu, but under BD settings I disabled BD Internet Access - I also erased the USB stick just to be sure. After these changes, the disc finally resumed playing in both players. I've been able to complete seeing the movie.<br /><br />Updating review score - I'll raise it to three stars. A disc shouldn't require changing default player settings to get it to play properly - for the time wasted to fix that problem I am taking two stars out. The issue, in a nutshell, is that if your player has wireless Internet access set up, the disc will stop playing after a while because of some implementation issue with the BDLive feature. The fix is to prevent Internet access (cutting the connection wasn't sufficient, it looks like it must be prohibited using player settings) and clear up all BDLive information stored by the player. Hopefully, this information will save some time to others that encounter this issue.to connect somewhere maybe to get fresh previews (like that's what I purchased this item for) and I suspect that maybe that is what gets stuck.

0061766089|5.0|Tim Brown's framework laid out in Change by Design is useful for anyone looking to improve an existing product, service, or system, and to make the world a better place.  This book is written for everyone, not just designers and is useful to everyone, not just designers.  This is a #1 read!!!
B003L77GGK|5.0|Supernatural always manages to get an emotional reaction from me, every season. Season 6 is no different. While a couple episodes are what I would consider weaker, the great stories during this season far outweigh those weak ones. My favorite part of the series is the character relationships. They have genuine depth. These characters are friends, family, enemies--sometimes all three at once--and they have the ability to rip your heart to pieces. Oh, and there's plenty of bloodshed and horror (always a plus), as well as the humorous interruptions that make Supernatural so unique. The finale will also leave you on the edge of your seat.
0756404738|4.0|I loved this book and was constantly frustrated that I couldn't dedicate more time to reading it. I anticipated it with fevor bordering on a mania.  And yet some of the things others have said in criticizing this are concerns with me.    There were a few points where Kvothe just gives the most basic of details, about things that seem to major events--a two week trip on the river that left him barely alive, and finally saying he'd spent too much time on the university.  Also, Kvothe adds to the frame of the story essentially saying he'd caused the current war that is raging, and yet nothing else.  There are hints of big, juicy stuff to come, but too little.  We know that both storylines will eventually converge, but I did miss some of what was in \\"Name of the Wind\\" which had him breaking a little more often, and bringing the current world into the story. My biggest concern is that he is still quite young at the end of this book, not even in his 20s, still a teenager of 16, and there is a lot to come.  I believe Rothfuss was using this to build a bridge to the final volume, as David Farland did with the second Runelords book \\"Brotherhood of the Wolf.\\"  I liked t his much more. But there is a lot to come in the final book--finally confronting the Chandarin who made him an orphan, starting a war, becoming known as the Kingkiller, and several other things. That's a lot to cram into one final volume. I woudln't be surprised if he needs to finish it in four volumes instead of three.    Now, having voiced all my concerns, let me tell you why I love this book.  Rothfuss' writing pulled me along, making me want to read more and more, and frustrating me that work and the rest of my life wouldn't give me the freedom I wanted to just sit for hours and do nothing but read this.  Kvothe is a real character, he's smart and he knows it. And that's the source of many of his problems. He doesn't recognize his bad choices till he's right in the middle of the consquences. He's by turnshonest and devious, sweet and calculating, charming and a bounder at times. But all of us have those sides to  us, and most of us have done things we shouldn't.  His friends are real too.    Rothfuss has also created one of the most believable worlds in the fantasy genres in 50 years.  It's a real world with multiple continents, multiple languages and cultures, a religion that plays a part in the lives of many of the characters--even if it doesn't with Kvothe--a monetary system, a believable magic system. And he's got a great sense of humor. I love the scene where he turned the tables on the Chronicler, to show him how easy it is for legends to spring up.    Rothfuss paid attention the details in the right way here: He doesn't bother creating flashy phrasing, and such. Rather he uses just the right words in the right places, and polishes each one so the entire work shines.  Good writing isn't about flash or reinventing the wheel, but about the right words in the right places, with each word carrying just a little more than its own natural weight.    I do want to read the next volume.  I just don't want to wait another four years for it.
B005COO1X6|5.0|King excels at short stories, makes you wish they were longer.  This was no exception and in reality, one of his best!
B004TTZHBK|5.0|This app has created a love for cooking in me. The videos are really helpful. Might be my favorite app.
B0058VW36U|5.0|The game loaded so slowly until the recent update. It's so much faster now and much easier to play a quick puzzle or two.
B000NA28I4|1.0|If one hasn't read the books, this movie is a nice stand-alone. Great scenery and good acting. Had it not been associated with Eragon the book, I would have thought differently about the movie. However, Eragon the movie sadly disappoints when a faithful reader compares it to the way the Harry Potter movies and Lord of the Ring movies clung to the essences and details of their relative book series. Eragon the movie is beautiful but holds practically none of the feeling of the books and, worse, doesn't even really correspond to the story line or the characters and their developing relationships. The details of the movie just don't match up with the books. I can hardly wait to read the final book in the series, but I really regret having wasted my time and expectations on the movie.
B004VMVTNU|5.0|I used to have such a hard time finding an alarm program that would actually force me to wake s in the morning.  this app does. :-) just that. its worth it just for that.  there is a free version that works. better
B0055PMJMW|1.0|So disappointed in these short stories.  I get the feeling they were ideas for possible books that never got written.  As one other reviewer mentioned they are very amatuerish and seen \\"unedited\\".  I just cancelled my preorder for the Nov. 2011 release of the same format by Connelly.  I love this author but these come nowhere near his usual.
B0050QV0RQ|5.0|I was genuinely surprised with this game. intuitive interface, easy to pick up and challenging to master. dialogue can get a bit weird; the tone of the character can be inconsistent, but overall one of the best games on Android if not the best!
B00479SVBU|4.0|An amazing product that works great overall. Device performs flawlessly, though sometimes the remote signal isn't detected and you must press buttons several times. Its not a big issue, just have to move the remote around a bit. Also the remote buttons are all the same size without any kinds of tactile indicators of which buttons are which. It makes using the remote at night a bit of a hassle as you can't tell what button you are pressing just by feel alone.  I was suprised at the strength of the FM signal, despite my car normaly having realy bad reception from most radio stations. It easily overides local radio stations, which is great when you want to listen to the device, but sometimes it is so strong you have to disconnect it to listen to any of the local stations without interference.  Also the shuffle function leaves something to be desired. Shuffling will cause it to cycle through all music on all the folders. I wish there was a way to choose to shuffle the music in a single folder, rather than all the music on the SD card/flash drive.  however, overall it is a great device for the price and performs exactly how it should. Great sound quality, responsive (except sometimes with the remote), and great fm signal strength. worked well on my 12 hour road trip, and back.
B0058WFO06|5.0|Got this in the mail today and just now finished a first listen. Have to say once again Mr Wilson has impressed and amazed...HTF does he keep doing this?...a gifted man for sure....The structure of the songs is always surprising, the lyrics are all over the place emotionally and the playing is well done indeed...by all involved. With guys like Steve Hackett, Tony Levin, Trey Gunn, Pat Mastelotto and Markus Reuter on board things just have to be done well eh?! There are sections that are nice mellow journeys to somewhere else and there are down right monstrous sections that make you think everything you know is about to explode. There are no let downs for even a second on both discs for me..I LOVE this stuff!! That moment when the Choir comes in on Raider ll is surprising then mixed moments later with some nice Flute and Clarinet playing and so on just meshes so well and sounds excellent....WOW!! Yep...this one is staying in the player for awhile. I just got the Levin Torn White release recently as well so I'm a very happy camper right now.
B002DMJLTE|4.0|In 1998 Hollywood did what they used to do and rarely do anymore: they released two A budget movies on the same theme. IN this case asteriods coming at the earth. The other was \\"armegeddon\\" Which is really a far more entertaining movie to be sure, it's more tongue in cheek than this one. This one is played serious to the hilt. It's realistic and it's effects look great even today.  This would have been better served though if it hadn't come out the same year as the other flick.  Still this is a drama played so straight that some people hated it, I didn't; the story is believable under the circomstances, although the biggest disaster that's happening now is the polluting of the world to pieces probably, this is doomsday sped up and of course some people would survive the disaster. YOu have top actors like Robert DUvall on board too and that helps. The blu ray looks pretty good with no lines or scratches like you'd see on the dreadful 'halloween h20' blu ray , that movie also came out in 1998 and it's blu ray is not well done. This one is however, the print looks pretty good and sometimes flat even but at least there's no dirt on the picture! This is the best  you are probably ever going to see this movie unless you went back in time to 1998 on opening night before the movies print was worn down through showing it.
B005NA3B8U|4.0|Okay, not exactly like the old days because we had actual controls instead of a touch screen.  But it's a close facsimile.  Very fun game for us old heads.  The bosses are still impossible to beat unless you can remember how you beat them back in the old days.  The graphics are nowhere near as good as the new android games, but IMHO the game play is more fun than most. I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because it sometimes doesn't load correctly on my Samsung Epic 4g and needs to be restarted a couple of times before it works.  But for only 4 quarters, the price can't be beat.  If anything, you should download it for your kids so you can actually beat them in something, and so they can have the privilege of experiencing a REAL classic video game.

B005GSY23M|5.0|I love the '80s synthesizer feel of this soundtrack! It harkens back to The Terminator (1984) soundtrack by Brad Fiedel. It features many, relatively, unknown or not so popular (in America anyways) artists and has the several tracks composed by one artist (Cliff Martinez). This structure is very similar to Terminator in that it also has the majority of the tracks composed by (Brad Fiedel) and a few by various artists (for example: Burning in the Third Degree by Tahnee Cain & Trianglz).   The soundtrack gave the movie a pretty '80s ethereal feel (despite all its crazy violence.) The credits of the movie reminded me of Grand Theft Auto: Vice City and this soundtrack just added to that feeling.  Overall, it's a good soundtrack if you like electronica/'80s pop synth.

I HAVE RECONSIDERED. BUT I STAND BY WHAT I SAID:<br /><br />Sorry but there really are 2 kinds of people. People who think you can put a drumbeat to Gregorian Chant, and people who know that you can't. Try Enigma 3, the solo male vocal works much better.
1582701709|4.0|This book provides a wonderful positive perspective on the power we possess to change and enhance our lives. The authors do a grand job at detailing their message about the law of attraction and how to harness the secret. I believe this text falls short only in one area: It doesn't take into account the power of crisis and the role it plays in shaping who we are. Lets face it, we have all been through crisis and we have overcome the event which has enhanced our character. We can go through life thinking and feeling positive and we will be rewarded but the whole world in not intrinsically controlled.<br />[...]<br />[...]
B005FUTBV4|5.0|\\"People just do the strangest things when they believe they're entitled. But they do even stranger things when they just plain believe.\\" After a group of kids meet an older woman for sex thing go terribly wrong. After being knocked out they wake up tied up and in cages in the middle of a church headed by fundamentalist preacher Abin Cooper (Parks). When the congregation gets out of hand FBI agent Keenan (Goodman) is called in. I will start off by saying that this is defiantly not a movie for everyone. Kevin Smith fans will love this as I did. Devoutly religious or the easily offended will want to avoid this. Dealing with extreme religious zealots who feel it's their job to rid the Earth of \\"evil\\" some scenes are hard to watch and parts are very disturbing but the message of the movie is worth the watch. With out trying to start a fight I agree with most of Smith's views in this one, the main one being that it's wrong to call homosexuals the embodiment of Satan on Earth and should all be put to death. I have been a huge Kevin Smith fan since \\"Clerks\\" and this is his best movie yet. I really liked this movie, but it's not for everyone. If the academy had any balls it would nominate at least the performances in this, but I'm not holding my breath. Overall, a very disturbing look at when religion goes to far. Will offend some people though so be warned. A movie that will get people talking. If you can handle this, watch it! I give it an A.<br /><br />Would I watch again? - I want to buy this *Also try - Camp Hell & Stigmata

B0049P1VHS|5.0|I am a life long horror fan and waited patiently to buy the DVD set for the first season of THE WALKING DEAD, for me it is the only way to watch this kind of TV.  And I must say the show was well worth the wait: THE WALKING DEAD is the best new show on TV in years and I commend AMC and Frank Darabont for having the guts to put it on the air; I mean, a TV series built around the zombie apocalypse, there's no way in hell ABC, CBS, NBC, or FOX would ever put something like this on the air, maybe that is why they are bleeding viewers?  I loved the way this series jumped right into the action: Deputy Sheriff Rick Grimes, in a coma after being wounded in the line of duty, wakes up in a seemingly deserted hospital, surrounded by rotting corpses, lined up row upon row. He quickly learns from another survivor that while he was out, a plague has ravaged humanity, wiping out civilization and ushering in a new Dark Age more horrific than any worst case scenario: the dead have risen to devour the living and their numbers seem endless.  But this in not a story centered on the zombies, it is very much about the human characters and the price they must pay to survive: how they must try and hold onto their humanity when death is coming for them day and night.  After a while, you wonder if the title isn't referring to the zombies, but to the living, now making their way in a world where survival simply may not be worth it.   This sounds pretty damn bleak, but it's terrific storytelling.  I am a sucker for a great end of the world tale, and I took notice that in every episode the natural world is presented as lush and green, full of bright sunshine, a perfect contrast to the horror in its midst.    There are some great scenes, especially Rick's arrival in Atlanta and his confrontation with an army of zombies in episode one; same thing for the nocturnal zombie attack at the end of episode four.  There are also plenty of quiet moments where characters are allowed to develop, some may think this slows the show down, but they add the depth needed to make the violent moments hit with a harder punch.  Yes there is gore, but it's not over the top, nobody is trying to outdo George A. Romero.  We are shown what is necessary to drive home the horror of the situation.  And the acting is terrific, especially newcomers Andrew Lincoln as Rick and Jon Bernthal as his partner and best friend, Shane, who shares a guilty secret with Rick's wife.  Jeffry DeMunn and Steven Yuen are standouts in the supporting cast, while Michael Rooker and Norman Reedus shine as a pair of redneck brothers.  And all praise to Robert Kirkman, whose comic book, THE WALKING DEAD,is what the series is based on.  My biggest complaint, the season is way too short at only six episodes.  At least they leave us wanting more; can't wait until season two.
B00062PN6I|5.0|I needed a quality pair of closed back headphones that were on the cheaper side for a class I'm taking in college. These headphones worked very well and came with a 1/4 inch adaptor that can be pulled off so the headphones work for an ipod or laptop also.

B003UYV08E|4.0|I liked this movie.  Mickey Rourke was surprisingly good in this.  He was paid a relatively low salary to star in it but rose to the occasion.  The gold teeth and cockatoo were his ideas (paid for and supplied by him).  Gywneth Paltrow's role is finally given some substance instead of her just being a pretty / helpless part of the scenery  - which was what she was given in the first movie.  I can recommend this as a fun movie.<br /><br />UPDATE:  When I had first reviewed this I had watched a DVD version borrowed from a friend.  I have now purchased in in Blu-Ray format to own.  The storytelling is good.  I will try and do a followup review on the technical quality.
B003UESJEM|3.0|I was so excited to order this movie through The Vine program.. After all look at the cast..Tommy Lee and all the others...<br /><br />I guess the word is Depressing.

It was okay....not great
0553805371|4.0|A short, ruminative and surprisingly rather lovely book. While Hawking continues his work and research, this may end up being his most apt valediction - it certainly feels that way. Hawking has been traveling along a fairly long, and rather lovely and understandable journey from certainty to something like doubt.<br /><br />The book teaches concepts and ideas that are current in physics and cosmology, but the main purpose is to wonder. In the context of the pervasive struggle to unify both Relativity and Quantum Theory into a unified Theory of Everything, Hawking expresses a feeling of something like doubt that this can happen. Not that he criticizes the enterprise, which is worthwhile, but he's not certain that it can be done. Further, he's not certain it needs to be done, in the sense that, while we may not come to understand the big questions about the universe (especially the biggest: where did it come from, how did it come, what was there before and where is it going), we will come to know more about it.<br /><br />So the book covers the science and delves, personally, into the philosophy. It is questioning, rather than argumentative, it suggests rather than answers, and that makes it both out of the ordinary and valuable.
B001TAFCBC|1.0|I love Jim Carrey, the reviews were universally good, and the concept sounded interesting, so I was enthused about watching this movie. BORING! I can't comment on the ending, because so much nothing happened that I couldn't finish it.

B005J2UM9S|4.0|The movie is 1h33m long. I was pretty much on edge and jumpy for 1h15m. Yes, the movie is corny at the start and a rip of the guys on Ghost Adventures. But if you can bare with it for the first 15-20 minutes, they get \\"locked in\\" and the scares begin. I'm gonna have to sleep with the lights on tonight.
B004ZNACA6|2.0|There was so much opportunity here to create a very special product.  But the packaging, design, and remastering leave much to be desired.  Cheap cardboard box and CD covers, mindless liner notes and booklet, no protective inner sleeves, and remastering that tries to walk the fine line between compression and true resolution.  I realize that CDs are the dinosaurs of the audio world, but these could have sounded so much better, no \\"air\\", no \\"dynamics\\", much closer to MP3 than audiophile.  Look for this set to be heavily discounted in the coming \\"holiday season\\".  But fear not, high resolution downloads and Blu-rays will fill the Floyd void, just follow the $$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$.
B005C5A6C0|5.0|Its a great progression from The Blackening. To me, Burn My Eyes, The Blackening, and Unto The Locust are all on epual par with each other. I agree with another reviewer when they said Unto The Locust gets better the more you listen to it. I would not be surprised if in the future these guys are up there on par with Metallica in the Rock n Roll hall of fame. If they continue to successfully progress like they have from Ashes of Empires to now, Unto The Locust, I definitely think they will.

B0042RUMIW|4.0|As the owner of various Sting and Police live albums, I'd say that this is definitely one of his best releases - if not the best.  At a time when most artists would be winding down or a pale shadow of themselves, Sting keeps the fire burning.<br /><br />Live in Berlin is an excellent recording; and features an assured performance with impeccable musicianship.  The setlist is exceptionally well arranged and planned, but my only complaint is that the DVD has an additional set of tracks, and wider selection.  So fans will need to find a way to \\"listen\\" to the DVD or rip the audio out.<br /><br />At the age of 60, Sting remains consistent.  He really doesn't have much else to prove and his solo career has transcended the Police on many levels. He really is one of the most consistent performers out there (as long as he doesn't start reversioning his music too much - Symphonicities was a little indulgent).<br /><br />There are little surprises here - the versions of the songs sound better imho, than their album cuts because they breathe more.  Especially like the intro to \\"Mad About You.\\"  The Orchestra's presence isn't overwhelming - in fact, it's rather nuanced.<br /><br />Looking forward to the impending Box set...!

B005LAZIRY|5.0|The term \\"progressive\\" as been tossed around a lot lately in the last 10 years or so as more, typically metal, bands have begun embracing prog rock intricacies, and finding commonalities that always existed but were never explicitly realized. Opeth has always done a masterful job at threading the needle between metal and prog, but with Heritage, they've made a balls-out prog record. Mikael, all in clean voice, leads his metal warriors through a Byzantine maze of the most genuine prog rock I've heard, really, since the 70s. But that's not to say Heritage is retread or overly imitative. It's not. It sounds like Opeth in 2011. It's phenomenal and we shouldn't be surprised that a band of this caliber could pull off such a huge achievement.
B000001FN1|5.0|Listen up! First of all for the metal heads who don't see any big deal about this album, think about it. Its 1987 for goodness sakes, and not many metal bands were rockin this hard. Warlock with Doro Pesch up front was killing it in Europe and its too bad that they didnt really make an American invasion.     Doro Pesch was and still is a leather clad fox with one of the best female voices ever in rock, and when she hit the stage it was in overdrive and she head banged with the best of em! Warlock in its self was a killer metal band they were probably capable of alot more than we got from them. Triumph and Agony was Warlocks best release but if you really want the full impact of Warlock I guess you had to see them live. You can still be privledged to do that by buying one of the concert DVDs available here on Amazon or even a Doro DVD. In fact there are videos available for viewing on youtube just to give you an idea.     My hat goes off to Doro Pesch who led this band. This gal was passionate about what she was doing and believed in the metal genre and she attacked it. We were just blessed that she also happened to be this incredibly beautifull blonde dressed in leather with a hell of a voice. Warlock and Doro can rock me anytime. If you havent heard Warlock you need to at least for the  experience there wont be another Dora Pesch in the metal business and thats another reason to have this cd.
B0006A9FKA|4.0|We had seen this a couple of times before deciding to add it to our personal collection.  Last night we watched with friends who had never seen it and found ourselves (and everyone) laughing even harder than when we first saw it.  A must in the halloween movie rotation.
B005G4TJI4|4.0|Movie - 4.5<br /><br />The first Transformers did a pretty good job. It has a great cast, great production value, a gripping score, and even a little humor. It's innocent enough that you feel for the character of Sam Witwicky, realize the scope of the Autobot/Decepticon war coming to earth, then get to watch it all unfold as a grand and adventurous sci-fi actioner. Revenge of the Fallen.. not so much. It takes the nobility out of Optimus Prime's character, overshadows the plot with a little too much juvenile humor, one-liners, and situational comedy for my tastes, then tries to go beyond the conventions of sci-fi by making a \\"heaven for robots,\\" while also making its female lead completely infallible to makeup discrepancies, then decides to ghetto-fies its robot cast by adding two inadvertently segregating \\"black\\" twin robots, and even flashes the movie-goers with John Toturo's ass in a jock strap (not a pretty sight). So yes; a writer's strike, no story or script, and only a year to shoot set the movie franchise back a bit (at least from a fanbase perspective). Thankfully, though, Dark of the Moon makes up for it, even surpassing TF1 in terms of character development, overall scope, and of course, brevity of action. For the writing, I enjoyed three particular elements: the ambition and search for self-worth of Sam's character, the more gritty and no-holds-barred nature of the storytelling, and the downright sense of treachery that seemed to loom throughout many of the characters. We see Sam yearning to feel useful and finding a purpose in life. He can't a find a job despite saving the world twice already, but at the same time knows he's capable of so much more than the office job he ends up with. His new girlfriend doesn't want him to be as ambitious because she feels that same kind of ambition is what got her bother killed in the military. Yes, the first half of the film is about as \\"fluffy\\" in spirit as the first two, but the overall structure is much less comedic than the former and substitutes it with a more epic story and darker tone in the second half. People and robots are killed, betrayal runs amok, and total kinetic action ensues for pretty much the entire duration of the movie thereafter. It's escapist sci-fi robot fantasy at its best that's a technical marvel, wonderfully choreographed, and everything one could hope for in a Michael Bay film.<br /><br />Video - 5.0<br /><br />- Video codec: MPEG-4 AVC<br />- Video resolution: 1080p<br />- Aspect ratio: 2.40:1<br />- Original aspect ratio: 2.39:1<br /><br />Prior to this BD release I'd only seen Dark of the Moon in 3D in theaters (and 3 times, to boot). If the 3D was that impressive, I'm sure a 2D BD presentation would've been just as stellar as the previous entries, and boy is it. They really went all out in filming this using 6 different cameras, 4 types of film negatives, and another 6 types of cinematographic processes ranging between 35mm, digital, and 3D dual-strip. While TF2 barely accomplished anything with its crappy IMAX sequences (not crap in the sense of quality, but the fact that there was just so little of it), TF3 has some amazing cinematography in general, whether it be 2D or 3D. As far as the 2D presentation goes it's as demo-worthy as you can get. The CG and visual effects in particular are pristine and flawless in terms of detail and clarity. All the lines in the robotic parts, scuffs in peoples' faces, stubble on their chins, tiny bits of debris falling from the sky, sparks ricocheting off of exploding structures, water droplets from splashes, steam and smoke from fired weapons, everything is perfectly visible from any given angle under every kind of lighting imaginable. Blacks and contrast are the biggest draw for me revealing lots of fine texturing in the production design, while colors are very vibrant, particularly in opposition to the grittier look of the second half of the movie. There's hardly any noise to speak of aside from maybe a couple of dark shots filmed in 35mm. Everything has either a clean digital sheen or a fine layer of film grain. There's no over-saturation of colors, no noise reduction, edge enhancement, banding, or any of those detracting elements that may otherwise bog the video presentation. My favorite scenes for demo material would be the part where Sam meets Dylan for the first time (for a good contrast of colors with the least bit of CG) and, of course, any part of that massive last hour where they're fighting the Decepticons in Chicago (for a great mix of real and CG-integrated footage). I know the Oscar committee hates Michael Bay and are all about politics, but a film as technically sound as this needs to win an award at least for something like cinematography, visual effects, or editing.<br /><br />Audio - 5.0<br /><br />Languages<br />- English: Dolby TrueHD 7.1<br />- English: Dolby Digital 5.1<br />- English: Dolby Digital 2.0<br />- French: Dolby Digital 5.1<br />- Portuguese: Dolby Digital 5.1<br />- Spanish: Dolby Digital 5.1<br /><br />Subtitles<br />- English, English SDH, French, Spanish, Portuguese<br /><br />Well, so much for Thor being my (previous) number one loudest BD (after its two-week reign). First, I want to address the supposed controversy about the use of a TrueHD encode. Yes, while TrueHD may be have the lowest bit rates of the three lossless codecs, it also takes up the least amount of disc space. I believe the reasoning behind this logic is because 1) it's still lossless; even TF1 has TrueHD and many people still refer to it as one of the premier demo discs, 2) not only does it still sound awesome, but it's even 7.1 to compensate for the fact that it is TrueHD in the first place, which if you consider TF1 to be pretty good, then this is even better, and 3) they need the extra space for the eventual 3D version which will surely take up more disc space, so instead of barely being able to fit a two and a half-hour movie in 3D AND with lossless audio without suffering possible compression issues, you do the math and tell me otherwise. Not to mention this disc already supports 3 other spoken languages in Dolby Digital 5.1 (again, more disc space). Now, as for the audio presentation itself, it should be a no-brainer. Greg P. Russell returns as re-recording mixer for, yet another, truly wonderful auditory experience. The guy has worked on all 3 Transformers films and 200 films altogether in his illustrious career. He's been nominated for 14 Oscars but hasn't won any because, again, the Oscar committee is full of pretentious sycophants that just won't give mainstream movies the credit they're due, let alone anything Michael Bay is a part of. Needless to say, this easily one of the finest presentations you'll hear on a BD. Dialogue remains clear from the center channel, even throughout the chaotic battle sequences, high and low ends are pitch-for-pitch perfect, directionality and separation are flawless from the remaining fronts, sides, and backs, and, of course, LFEs are expectedly ground-shaking. Specifically, the score by Steve Jablonsky is very fitting for the film. It works something to the affect of Hans Zimmer's work in The Dark Knight and Inception giving a very emotional feel to the happenings on screen. But it's to be expected since Jablonsky is a disciple of his. My favorite scenes: the highway chase when Bumblebee transforms in mid-air to catch Sam and the part where they fight Shockwave. Oscar committee, please be more open-minded and at least give Mr. Russell is much-deserved award.<br /><br />Extras - 0.5<br /><br />There's nothing here, of course, as they're pulling off an Avatar and trying to capitalize as fast as they can. But at least Paramount gave early warning. I'm sure the eventual deluxe package will have the usual commentary and 2+ hours of special features on a separate disc when it comes out. As much work as they put into this, I'm actually very eager to see how they did it.<br /><br />Overall -4.0<br /><br />Based on the average scores and whether or not you even care for extras (or even 3D) this could either be a \\"buy now\\" or \\"buy it later\\" recommendation. I, for one, love special features in general and will gladly wait for a complete package. Those who don't mind a bare bones release, however, shouldn't hesitate to get this. This is easily the best of the three Transformers films. It has a gradually building plot structure, a better balance of humor, amazing production value, and is overall a darker and more satisfying film altogether. And with equally amazing A/V quality, fans of the franchise will definitely be pleased.
B004EBT5CU|5.0|I have come recently to Adele's music. It must be good; it has sold millions. For mine it's a great piece of work.Beautifully written, played, sung, recorded and mixed. It is an examination of love and loss which is by turns defiant, sad, reflective and so very real. Adele never holds back. So, for those of us who have loved and lost, listen alone through good equipment, and turn up the volume.ps It's an album in the old way; play it right through, in the original track order.

B0034G4OUO|3.0|Dwayne \\"The Rock\\" Johnson is \\"Driver,\\" a former getaway driver and ex-convict bent on getting even with those who had framed him and killed his brother ten years ago. On the day he is released from the jail, Driver goes straight to the first target and does what he does remorselessly. While two police detectives \\"Cop\\" (Billy Bob Thornton) and Cicero (Carla Gugino) investigate the case, a hit man 'Killer' (Oliver Jackson-Cohen) is hired by someone to take down the vengeful Driver.  It seems part of the film's inspiration came from gritty, old-fashioned 70s action films and the stars like Charles Bronson. Dwayne Johnson's laconic hero may be merciless in distributing his own brand of justice, but he is not totally inhuman, as the back story about his past in the film's mid-section reveals. Some reviewers may call \\"Faster\\" an action flick, and directed by George Tillman Jr. (\\"Men of Honor\\"), the film has several car chases and shoot-outs, but it is not exactly about actions, or stunts, but about the characters. You just can't expect a \\"The Fast and The Furious\\"-like, action-packed film here.  Dwayne Johnson is convincing as the avenger refusing to forget his past, and Billy Bob Thornton turns in a solid performance as a drug-addicted detective struggling within himself, but the filmmakers' worthy attempt at a character-driven drama is undermined by the sluggish pace and too many supporting characters, some of which are out of place here. Though the larger-than-life characters themselves are interesting, the subplot about 'Killer', a billionaire / contract killer having some commitment issues with his girlfriend Lily (Maggie Grace) goes nowhere.  \\"Faster\\" is a nice throwback to the classic 70s action movies, but this could have been much better with a tighter plotline and a faster pace.
B005ELZKWS|5.0|These guys, whether anyone likes or dislikes them or their music, are having fun no matter what type of review is posted.  Rock on I say!  Before this band was formed they'd already made their mark on the music world, made their millions, too, and will continue to do so whether Chickenfoot III sells 500,000 copies or not.  Anybody who doesn't like hard rock or any member of the band, or a down-on-your knees VH worshipper, DON'T BUY IT!  It's as plain and simple as that.  Me, I think it's great and I can't wait to see them live again.  I'll certainly play this new release OFTEN and LOUD!  Already on my IPOD!  P.S.- I am a Van Halen fan also and no matter what the quality of their next release is, I will add it to my music collection.
0385534639|5.0|If you are looking for intense action, suspense, steamy romance, or \\"magic\\" stories like Harry Potter, you may not like this book. But, if you are a \\"reveur\\" (dreamer) who may wish to steep in a book that takes you away from the kinds of modern books that reflect our anxious age, if you want to remember what it was like, as a child, to be entranced by simple things, like the smell of caramel popcorn at a fair, to experience the \\"magic\\" that most of us have forgotten - the magic of possibility, of romance, of a non-cynical state of being that just explores the wonder of life, then you may love this book. Those who criticize the story line may have forgotten, or never experienced, the pleasure of just wandering from tent to tent in a circus, or book, exploring the characters within. And those of us reveurs that have read and loved this book understand the wisdom of the ending lines, where \\"magic\\" is explained, and in which the book itself is understood as such. So, I hope you can wander in this book, and explore the gift of this circus we all live in.
B004XDYJRU|5.0|I love how this application let's me tune into the web stream of all my hometown stations. With my long commute, one of my favorite stations fades out about halfway to work, but with TuneIn I never lose the signal. Thanks for such a cool app!
B005HSL626|1.0|this game has too many bugs. it needs to be updated. thanks.  it force closes too much and has too much lag.
B003YBUSMW|4.0|I bought this wheel to use with Forza 3 and to try and get used to a wheel before Forza 4 comes out.  After considering the much more expensive version of this with Force Feedback and even the much much more expensive Fantec CSR wheel and pedals.   I chose this one because of the other good reviews here and because it came with a 2 year warranty, a HUGE deal for me. Warranty's have saved my skin more than once from defective products.  I was very surprised to feel this wheel out. It's build quality is much better than expected.  PROS:  Relevantly inexpensive for the quality.  Good heavy weight.  Comes with a table clamp and rubbery, leg things to place it on your lap.  Good rubbery grip.   No creeks or squeaks, very quiet.   CONS:  No feedback at all.  Pedals are a little too far apart.
0316010669|5.0|I genuinely could not put down this book. If you have any personal insight, you should enjoy this book. A fascinating look at how much our subconscious influences everything we do everyday. I'm shocked at the other reviews. I think perhaps it's a bit of the whole \\"inconvenient truth\\" thing; maybe it's not that they don't like the book but they don't like to face what it's trying to tell them - that we do not have complete conscious control over everything. Scary, maybe, but this book can help teach us how to harness that. I'm an actor and director and for someone who has to look at what makes people tick, it's a brill book. My husband got bored of me telling everyone we meet every piecce of research in it!
B003BKF6AU|5.0|Between the mysterious baritone vocals, to the intricate melodies/drum patterns and the awesomely abstract/deep lyrics, The National is honestly one of my favorite bands of all time.  They're one of those bands that is capable of reaching listeners from any generation.  I'm 19, my oldest brother is 32, and my dad is 58.  I can safely say that we're all fans of The National.  This album showcases their talent beautifully and is a significant step forward for rock as a whole.    To those purchasing the vinyl: it's awesome.  I have a pretty extensive collection and this is probably the most well-put-together piece in my showcase.  Very cool design and great quality.  Vinyl, CD, MP3, 8-Track.. whatever.  Get this album and listen to it.  You won't be disappointed.
B001U887WE|5.0|These shoes are so comfy and they are just like wearing slippers except they are shoes. Really warm and cozy, if you want to wear bigger socks in winter get a larger size though :)
B0052U59F4|5.0|I cannot begin to explain how this book sucked me in. In the beginning her way of speaking was getting on my nerves but then either she gets better or I get used to it. Oh my....her favorite term and the best way to explain how I feel about this book. It grabbed me from the start and I read it all the way through there was no stopping until I got to the end. Downloading book two to my kindle now because I need to know what happens with these two...BDSM is not my thing but I kept reading because it was not Ana's thing either so I was curious if she would turn around about it.  OH my..... I had to keep fanning my self  :)
B001IFZL50|5.0|Great show! I wish it would have more episodes though. I loved each and every single episode this mini-series had. Hopefully HBO puts out another war like show because they sure do know how to make them!
030788743X|5.0|Understand, I'm a long-time geek at heart.  That being said, in terms of pure fun, this book is the best time I've had in YEARS!!  If you have any affinity for '80's pop culture, sci-fi, fantasy, anime, role-playing and of course, video games and game history, you will eat this novel up.  I felt like someone was totally speaking my language; it's not just a few scattered references to the culture...it's a full-on homage.  Loved it!
030788743X|5.0|Combine elements of Snow Crash, Willy Wonka, and Neuromancer, then season with a dash of Wall-E and you get Ready Player One.  I read this in a little over a day and loved the entire thing. If you're between 45 and 35, you really need to read this. Total nostalgia trip.
B0016HNOXQ|5.0|I won't write one of these lengthy reviews that dissects each and every track. Safe to say I love the whole album, not a single \\"dud\\". Standouts to me:  \\"The Rip\\"  \\"Plastic\\"  \\"We Carry On\\"  \\"Machine Gun\\"  \\"Small\\"  In this album I hear echoes of their past work, some early 80s synth, late 90s Bjork, 2000s Radiohead, The Doors and a lot more. This is an amazing album and I urge anyone who likes \\"art rock\\" to get this!
B0001ARCFA|5.0|First and foremost, these are great cans.  Sounds reproduction is true.  I picked up a little sibilance on some audio yesterday but in all fairness it was an mp3, so credit where it's due... these are great headphones. These headphones are built for audiophiles, not the \\"trendy\\" consumer.  As such, they're not bass-heavy or optimized for one specific genre of music. They will be true to your EQ and I'd say they are the flattest headphones I've owned, in terms of even response throughout the entire spectrum.  They do a great job revealing the lack of high-end with compressed audio.  These are open air, and by no means \\"isolating\\" headphones.  You will easily be able to hear the world outside you, and be careful cranking up the gain too much as you'll feedback into the mic if you're doing studio work.  What I did not expect was for them to be made in China.  I thought high-end AKGs would come from Austria.  While I appreciate the more affordable price point, I'm saddened to see another company farm off its manufacturing.  No idea if the construction is as long lasting, but the sound quality is what I expected.  I am very satisfied with my purchase.
B0045HU1M6|5.0|My Wife and I love this show.  I especial enjoyed the episodes with Zack.  I think that these episodes are good.  I like the chemistry between the actors.  We were glad to see Booth and Brennen start down the path of being more than just friends.  I hope that the Bones series continues.  I would like to see a season 7, 8, 9 ... As I think this show is worth watching more than once.  I am currently re-watching the seasons 1 - 6 as we wait for season 7.<br /><br />I would like to see Zack come back since he really didn't kill anyone. Although he was an accomplish to murder.  Zacks fear is that if anyone learns that he didn't kill anyone he would be removed from his current holding state and be placed in a regular prison of which he would not do well there.<br /><br />The bones story builds each character up and gives value to the story.  My wife and I really enjoy watching these episodes and want the series to continue.
B004JN1D2I|5.0|Working fine for me on multiple devices.  Price point is the only complaint.  Not up to Amazon though. Read these books if your a fan of the genre, or of the tv series
B0055OK2T0|4.0|It was completely different from what I thought it would be.  It wasn't just another run of the mill thriller.  It was thought provoking and refreshing to have a movie that addressed subjects that have become uncomfortable to talk about.  Unexpected and highly enjoyable to watch.
B004ZNARH4|1.0|Poor Packaging and the CD's have a very very very low print quality. 120$ is too way expensive for this box.   I do not recommend it.
B003XF1OJK|5.0|This book is really good and has everything a halo fan would love in a book if your a halo fan buy this book today.
B005DZMODI|3.0|The jobs is very interesting and shows the masters working. It is different. I prefer the other trditional styles of EC. But... if you are an EC fan you have to buy the CD to put in your collection.
B0050QV0RQ|4.0|Excellent game and I am not a big RPG person and it I still had fun.  Good Nintendo throw back.  My one issue is that I spent two hours playing out and then died and it never auto saved.  I figured it would save at the new town or in the inn but it doesn't.  Just remember to SAVE often until they fix this issue.  Mobile games should have better auto saves.
B004KRQFI0|5.0|Unbelieveable sound is eminating from this CD. Be it from the first few tracks, all but hte final 2 remixes by other artists. One just seems like a slow down and doesn't seem to add to much to the track itself.<br />1 Rock N' Roll- A Super track with a quick begining. Absolutely impressive especially after it hits the big Drop. I love it because just as it seems the track is going to become boring it slams you on your face.<br />2 Scary Monsters And Nice Sprites- Absolutely the reason that the CD is named after this track. Showing all the beauty of the differences that a song can have in the beginning all the way to the final few Seconds.<br />Just a slight preview of the tracks that you could be able to purchase, considering you can preview them before you even buy them!
B005JN988I|5.0|Emotional/mental whiplash of the highest measure.  Belly laughs and gut-wrenching emotions coming so swift and suddenly that it's impossible to absorb in just one viewing.  The mind racing to keep up and understand all the implications of each reveal.  A MUST OWN EPISODE if there ever was one.  And there's dozens of those - but this is a topper!)
B00001U03Q|5.0|I love whatever Eric Clapton writes and sings, but this CD is good music period. IMHO it is better than the Cream of Clapton. It has the obligatory Unplugged version of Layla, as well as Tears In Heaven; but it offers the listener the multi-level ear-candy of Running On Faith and  the beautiful string-fingering on River Of Tears. A best buy in my book.
B005G4TJI4|5.0|Absolutely awesome as usual.  One of the best actions series of all time!!  You cannot ask for anymore than what Michael Bay and company provide here.
B0058VW36U|5.0|Highly addictive and extremely frustrating all at the same time.  Loved it on my I-Touch and love it here.  Works great on my DROID X.
B005G4TJI4|2.0|I enjoyed the first Transformers immensely.  It was quirky, fun and exciting. I'd heard Dark Side of the Moon had recaptured some of that magic.  And at first it mostly did.  But then, like so many big budget action movies it devolved into noise, machines smashing one another one frame after another, after another, after another... And at over 2.5 hours in length you reach a point where you stop caring.  You could edit out a third of the content and it would have been a better movie.
B00466HN86|5.0|Best movie we saw this year. The whole family really enjoyed it. It was packed with action, drama and real faith. I've already put my name on the list to order the DVD when it comes out.
B0042J6VUS|4.0|i love my item and the shipping was very fast just as in description...but even if the item is new i can tell it is very cheep and feels like its going to break anytime and i have to be super careful with it.
B002BCNK1Q|5.0|Gran Torino knocks the viewer off their seat with a hard hitting story that is laced with thumping humour and heartbreaking inspiration. Starring Clint Eastwood, it is the experience of personal loss for all the lead characters in this film, which is a building block for their own greater development. The movie highlights many troubling social dynamics, often with an at times cranky old man's well aimed boot and good heart.  Nicholas R.W. Henning - Australian Author
B0050CQY1W|5.0|I didn't really know if I wanted to get this CD but after she performed on  the awards show....I had too.  I loooooooooooooooove this album and I believe   of her BEST.
B000M4RG42|5.0|Flags of Our Fathers is an outstanding insight into the stories of the men who raised the American flag on Iwo Jima during WWII. So many connotations were derived from this eminent and inspiring image, yet the men who carried out this duty as requested by the superiors, found themselves in a frenzy of media and public interest. This wonderful film puts face and personality to the servicemen who served on Iwo Jima, which respectfully acknowledges the courage of their contribution, and their at times rutted adjustment to sudden national fame.  Nicholas R.W. Henning - Australian Author
0553801473|2.0|I hardly ever write a book review after I have read it but because this book was such a disappointment, I must say this was by far the worst book of the series. After waiting several years for what I thought was going to be the best and final book, I was terribly let down. If I did not buy this book for my ipad it would already be back on Amazon for resale. Unfortunately I can never get the time back that it took me to read.
B003ASLJQS|5.0|Mystic River is a scintillating film that reassures the viewer to feel certain, and suddenly wallops this secure belief with startling revelations. Loyalties and objectivity are tested in the narrative of this movie, which concludes with assumptions as the cause of devastating miscalculations. A fantastic film!  Nicholas R.W. Henning - Australian Author
1599218011|5.0|I loved this book. It has all the background information on healthy eating as well as awesome recipes. This book feels good with great colors and images and the writing is so honest and fun. Kris Carr gives you tons of resources to help you eat healthier. This isn't about losing weight (although a great side effect), but about being healthy. A much needed message in the age of fast food and stressful living.
B00005JPKE|5.0|\\"Letters from Iwo Jima\\" is a film that provides a Japanese perspective regarding the WWII island battle, and works in partnership with \\"Flags of Our Fathers\\". It is rare that a viewer has an opportunity to consider multiple narratives regarding a war. Yet Director Clint Eastwood's excellent foresight allows the viewer to appreciate that the Japanese soldier had their own duty, and suffered immense casualties too.  Nicholas R.W. Henning - Australian Author
030726839X|3.0|I enjoyed Max Hastings treatment of Churchill during the war, using it as a faux Vol 3 to Manchester's magisterial treatment.  But Hastings lacks Manchester's gift for providing a coherent narrative throughout the course of the book.  I was looking for the whole story and felt that Hastings was providing insights here and there through the course of these 5 critical years, assuming his writer was thoroughly familiar with primary plot points.  The portion of the book dealing with Churchill before the US entered the war was better written than the rest of the tome.  I walked away a bit disappointed.  But for readers very interested in Churchill, this book should probably be read.
B0058VW36U|5.0|...that is why I rarely submit any reviews and take most with a grain of salt.  But had to take the time to encourage you to purchase this game.  I was fortunate to get it while it was the Free App of the Day but had I known that it was this good. I would have purchased it a long time ago.  if you like physic puzzle game similar to Angry Birds, then you will not be dissatisfied with Cut the Rope.
B001N26GFC|2.0|Mostly it made me feel annoyed with myself for hanging tight and watching to the 'inconclusion' a film I disliked from the first scene.<br /><br />That Poppy is an annoying as any human on Earth! She's the 'happy' character of the film, and I'm pretty sure I'm supposed to appreciate her irrepressible jolliness, her refusal to submit to or even acknowledge any of the less gleeful feelings of people around her -- her two sisters, her house mate, her flamenco teacher, and the sorry sod of a driving instructor whom she torments with her 'carefree' narcissism. The driving teacher is her antipode, a guy who grieves and rages at life in as unbalanced a fashion as Poppy smirks and jives. He blames Life -- his other students and 'the multiculturalists' especially, and finally he blames Poppy for seducing/manipulating him with her flirtatious bouyancy. But in subtler ways, Poppy also blames or judges nearly everyone for their 'failure' to be as 'happy' as she professes to be. Is she really that happy, or is she hysterically acting out happiness?<br /><br />I suppose it's well enough made, this film. Well enough acted. A sociological study of a certain age/class cohort of ordinary youngish people in England today. But it wasn't fun to watch.
0385344325|5.0|alwasy have good luck with Amazon from music to books to firearms accesories. Always on time and always the right item
B000LB7G00|1.0|I had troubles with my 3d mouse as soon as it arrived, i emailed support twice but they never responded (they said they had). The mouse froze my keyboard and would only occasionally work maybe 10% of the time with catia, Rhino, autocad, or 3dsmax, I returned the mouse to amazon for another one, same problem, i called support and spoke to them, they told me there was a batch of mice that had a firmware issue and that i was unlucky to get two from the same batch.  the engineers were supposed to contact me to mail me out the firmware update, but i haven't heard back. so i'm sending my second back for a refund.  can't risk getting another from the faulty batch.  interesting note...  i couldn't find any mention of the firmware issue on the website.
B003R0MEZ4|5.0|Five stars is not enough for this fantastic DVD which I thoroughly enjoyed.  Despite being a region 1 DVD I was able to play it on my DVD which plays other regions then the UK one and I will mean I will buy more DVDs from America rather then waiting for the UK versions.  Which great!  The DVD arrived arrived quite quickly after ordering despite coming from America.  I thoroughly recommend Criminal Minds Season 6 to anyone who loves the series and does not have Living TV.
B0058VW36U|5.0|love it! this is a simple but fun game and Om nom is a very cute character. i love his face when you miss with the candy!
0143117009|5.0|I try to rate books not so much on how much I \\"like\\" them but rather on how much of the book remains with me years later, and by how often I refer to it in conversation.    This requires a certain passage of time before I even know each book's value to me.  \\"Collapse\\" passes this test.  Two years later and I not only recall much of the book's content but I also quote it often.    For example, Diamond's chapter on Australia has forever changed the way I look at a world map.  His explanation of the poor Australian soil made me search for a map that showed where the best soil in the world was located.    I was suprised to see that there are very few \\"bread baskets\\" on the planet, one of which I live in, the Red River Valley of the U.S. midwest.    It seems to me that those lucky enough to be born in one of these areas should be thankful instead of arrogant toward those who were born on depleted soil.  Granted, Australia isn't poor, but had they not been a white colony of England, which offered them access to the post-agriculture and post-industrial economies of finance and service industries, it very well could be like Africa.
B004P8JPS6|1.0|I have read every one of Lee Child's Reacher novels and read this one soon after its release. This one is the most disappointing. I thought with the last couple (the last one in particular) Child was phoning it in. Maybe too tight a deadline. But it's worse than that. He's ill informed at best with respect to the military, guns, combat etc. His plots have GAPING holes and just don't stand up even in the imagination any longer. The've also become boring, substituting background (scenery etc) for real story telling. Last, I can stand an author using his or her craft to plug their political views, even when I disagree, as long as the book is good. Child has become a liberal hack without a decent tale. If you enjoy Vince Flynn, John Sanford etc pass this one. I regretfully think it is time to pass Child altogether.  Just my opinion.
B005EZJ3MW|2.0|Ms. Lovato, what were you thinking here? Demi has so much talent and I think it's a shame that she's not showing it as much as she could. This is coming from a girl who has been a Lovatic since the beginning. I still love Demi but this just disappoints me. I fell in LOVE with Here We Go Again. There wasn't a single song on that album I didn't like. But on Unbroken, I just didn't get the same vibe. The only songs I like off of this album are My Love Is Like A Star, Mistake, Skyscraper, Lightweight and For The Love of A Daughter. I miss your old rocker chick self! I will always love Demi but I wish she'd be her old hard rock self again :) <3
1416955070|5.0|I came across these books right after I read Twilight. I was so in love with Edward Cullen at the time, that I didn't think I would be able to find another book/trilogy that would even come close. Boy, was I wrong. Honestly, I enjoyed these books so much! Probably even more than the Twilight Saga. The world that Cassandra Clare opens is a reader's dream come true. I thought that I would come across parts or chapters in the books that would've been just filler . . . no real need for them, only put in to make the book thicker (seriously!). I didn't find that at all in these books. Everything that Clare wrote had a reason. It flowed with her writing, and needed to be included. The twists and turns throughout the novel (and the series) were enough to keep the readers wanting more. Needing to know what Cassandra Clare could possibly come up with next to top the last shocker she threw at us.   And then there's Jace . . . Yes, my love affair with Edward ended soon after. Jace was all I thought about. His \\"I don't care\\" attitude, his \\"not so knight in shining armor\\" ways, his blunt answers that leave you giggling out loud (honest! I caught myself doing it many times). I don't really don't think there is a woman alive who can resist his charm.   This book/trilogy was bloody brilliant (cue the English acccent). I loved every page, every chapter, every word. If you love supernatural fantasy books, I recommend you pick these up, snuggle up in a blanket, and turn the lights down low. You're in for a treat! Cheers!
B002C2XXJY|5.0|This album is 2 years old but it seems so new! Every Time You Lie, World of Chances, Catch Me, Falling Over Me, Stop The World and Got Dynamite are my favorites but the whole album is amazing! Demi is a magnificent singer and songwriter. Miss Lovato's style is like no other :)
B004EPYZPS|5.0|Well, now that I've seen it I've absolutely love it, the effects of the main scene were of course CGI, which made it incredibly realistic. Well, J.J. Abrams + Speilberg, E.T., GO HOME! The setting of 1979 Ohio was really authentic with the music, cars, clothes, cameras and more. I have to say that my favorite scene was when Joey, Alice, Charles, and the gang went to a train station and their former science teacher at their middle school drives his truck on to the train tracks and causes a HUGE train crash! That was honestly one of the best movie scenes I've ever seen. Now during the huge crash an alien is let loose in their town. After they get the film strip, Charles and Joey see alien claws behind the train car. I really don't want to give the ending away, so I'm going to let you buy the movie :P But it's definitely, if it could get a letter grade, I would give it an A++++++
B0013K2UCC|4.0|John Legend is scary talented. He really is a legend. His voice is so jazzy and smooth, especially in Ordinary People (which is amazing.) I look forward to hearing more of his music :)
0756405890|4.0|This review is going to concentrate on what I perceive to be the weaknesses of the Kingkiller Chronicles, as so many have covered the strengths with great eloquence. In the final result, I definitely enjoyed the books and intend on purchasing the third when it's released. I will attempt to avoid spoilers in the review, but I may inadvertently let something slip. I apologize in advance.  The \\"Name of the Wind\\" and \\"The Wise Man's Fear\\" tell the story of a wizard named Kvothe who's giving his biography to The Chronicler over three days. Each day corresponds to one book. Mr. Rothfuss has come up with interesting characters and engaging scenarios, but the books suffer one major weakness: they are a set of short stories patched together with the biography conceit, with occasional forays into mythological storytelling and folk-songs.  The story becomes somewhat disjointed as each of the short stories tends to have a major theme that goes until it runs out of steam, whereupon Mr. Rothfuss moves Kvothe to another location for a different story and different theme. If Kvothe has a single driving motive, it's revenge for the murder of his parents and their gypsy-like theatrical troupe. However, it seems to be forgotten for major portions of the books until it's time to digress into someone telling the story of a myth or he gets dragged into something by his erstwhile lover and obsession. It's hard to see how this geas of his is truly impacting his character outside of the stories where he's directly investigating the murderers.  The other weakness, which I think will make it difficult for Mr. Rothfuss to finish the story in the third book, is the pacing. Mr. Rothfuss seems to be fighting himself with regard to the amount of detail he wants to include compared to what needs to be accomplished to finish the trilogy in only three books. One of the great strengths of the books is the level of detail Mr. Rothfuss has put into the two books so far; you can tell he has given a greatdeal of thought into the world and how it works and the myths and the truth behind the myth. However, the desire to impart all of this detail must put Mr. Rothfuss in a conundrum: use all the detail that will be required to tell the story of Kvothe or cut the stories he wants to tell and finish the story in three books. Mr. Rothfuss has taken someone who must be one of the most powerful arcanists in the world and placed him in a position that will be difficult to attain in his self-imposed limit. Mr. Rothfuss must take Kvothe and raise him unto world-wide fame and then make it believable that this man would choose to hide away as an unassuming innkeeper in the middle of nowhere.  So, in the end, these weaknesses will not keep me from purchasing Mr. Rothfuss next book. I heartily recommend The Name of the Wind and The Wise Man's Fear to anyone looking for a new fantasy author to read. I do hope that Mr. Rothfuss will get away from the short story format which I think is the major weakness of the books.
0062060554|3.0|After all the hype I really expected this book to be more of a spine tingler.  It seems the author could have really done something interesting with the premise. I was left dissapointed with the predictable plot though.  Not much of a mystery. It is easy to figure out. Watson could have had me jumpy, not sure who to trust if anyone, even the narrator.  The idea of reading about a character with no memory but the reader knowing somebody is lying and she is in danger but not knowing who could have been really suspensful.  There could have been more twists and holes left for me to wonder about. I expected startlig revelations.  There weren't any.  It just seems like so much more could have been done with the plot.  Plus, I feel like the end had everything end up a little to perfectly.  The only big question I had was the one the author does not really intend me to which is why before her injury Watson made the choices she made and how I am supposed to believe she is happy with her circumstances now that she is actually worse off than when she made those choices.  That said, the book is a quick and rather fun read.  I was not bored and though not creeped out I was entertained.  I recommend Sophie Hannah's books instead if you want to read something that will actually give you a bit of a thrill.
0525423281|4.0|Once again, this was another sweet teen love story by Stephanie Perkins.  But I'm not what I really want to say about this book.  I enjoyed it.  Yet I didn't race through it as quickly as I thought I would.  I liked that Lola was different and loved to dress up in her costumes, yet there was something about her that I didn't connect with.  Cricket seems like such a sweet guy, but he doesn't seem like one of those males characters that I'm sure I'd fall for if I was in the girls shoes.    So I'm not really sure what I think.  When I think of the big picture, I think of this sweet, almost innocent love story, which I always enjoy reading.  But when I think back to when I was reading it, it was only okay.  Not that I disliked it at all, not even a little bit.  I think for some reason I was just expecting to be blown away and instead of being \\"wow\\"ed I was just pleased.  If that even makes any sense.  Yeah.  So either way, I enjoyed it.  :)
B0055SWM08|5.0|Launched it and was instantly captivated.  My pennies have never been as well spent.  It's a great way to pass the time.
0061256447|4.0|\\"The Judas Strain\\" was my first James Rollins novel.  I had a hard time getting into the novel at first because it starts out with a historical account of Marco Polo then goes from there to the Vatican.  It seemed like the story was going to be more of a historical/religious novel, which is subject matter I don't find interesting.  I agree that there is some merit to one reviewer's comment about the book \\"trying too hard to be the Davinici Code.\\"  However, I don't agree that the narration by Peter Jay Fernandez was awful.  It thought it was fine.  I liked the voice Fernandez used for Kowalski especially.  Perhaps if a reader already listened to a Sigma Force novel narrated by someone else, it may be difficult for the reader to get used to new voices for the characters.  I can only assume that is what happened for another reviewer who said Peter Jay Fernandez ruined the book for him.  And I also don't agree that the novel was boring.  There was plenty of action (almost non-stop action really).  As to the complaint that the characters are not engaging, I say the characters \\"kind of grow on you\\".  As you read more of the Sigma Force novels, you get to know the Sigma Force team better and better.  There are simply too many Sigma Force characters to fully explore in just one novel.  The focus is on action, and that means there just isn't as much time devoted to character exploration as a necessity.  The main thing I really enjoy about James Rollins' books is how he integrates science seamlessly with action.  The reader is given plenty of scientific explanation without feeling like he/she just attended a college lecture.  In \\"The Judas Strain\\", Sigma Force has to figure out how benign bacteria turns into a deadly strain capable of wiping out humanity.  What follows is a race against time to solve the origins of the strain and the cure.  Does that sound boring to you?  Believe me, it's not.  \\"The Judas Strain\\" is not the best novel I've ever read.  But it did make me wantto read more of James Rollins' Sigma Force novels.
B0053KWDES|5.0|Well, everything has been said already. It`s really amazing how this little fella is able to drive my high impedance Sennheiser PXC 450 *which by the way I highly recommend). I used the FiiO I5 before, which was OK, but never offered the sound quality that the E11 delivers. I love the bass and the gain switch. For bass, the middle setting should do in most cases. Well, FiiO, if zour reading this: Good work!

0792839730|4.0|A Bridge Too Far is a good movie.  The actors are great, the quality is pretty good and the uniforms and much of the equipment is authentic.  The only problems I had were with the tanks.  The British \\"Shermans\\" are actually Sherman 76s which were used in small numbers.  One of them seems to turn into the wreck of an M-10 when it blows up.  Another problem in accuracy is the Son Bridge, the one that blows up.  It was supposed to be in a town but the director placed it in an open field.  The German tanks are nothing like German tanks at least from World War two.  The American river assault and Grabner's assault across Arnhem Bridge are alone worth the price of the movie.

B002ZG99N6|5.0|At first this movie seems like another Bank-Robber/Gangster film.  But it quickly changes course, and becomes a fairly deep character-study and a painful, plausible, romance.  It does these last two things beautifully.  The plot, like the character Ben Affleck plays, moves steadily away from robbing and violence, and steadily toward change and honesty.  The heroine, Claire Keesey (played by Rebecca Hall), becomes both the agent and victim of this process, and herself changes and grows, often painfully, in the process.  I have lived in Boston, and I loved the claustrophobic, almost airless, street-level shots of cramped houses and stuffed-together warehouses.  And I LOVED the acting.  I knew Ben Affleck could act (after seeing him in \\"Good Will Hunting\\" and \\"State of Play\\") but I also knew he mostly doesn't (after seeing him in much else).  Here he is superb.  He underacts, which is precisely right for this role.  His foil is Jeremy Renner, who is superb.  This guy is the best actor in the world.  Eat your heart out, Kevin Spacey.  And Rebecca Hall, whom I had never seen before, is wonderful.  You can see her transformation happening before your eyes: from insular townie to wide-eyed dupe to shocked victim to sneaky conspirator.  And who knew Affleck could direct?  He does.  The movie works seamlessly.  It is exciting, and painful, and moving, and honest, and involving at every turn.  A great film.
0525423281|5.0|Swoon.<br /><br />SQUEE!!<br /><br />&lt;/end review><br /><br />Just Kidding!! (But I could stop at that. Really, I could.) I feel like I was the last person in the world to read Anna and the French Kiss (Review) and I waited anxiously for the release of Lola. I read reviews. I read tweets. I. Could. Not. Wait.<br /><br />The best part about all the buzz/hype for this book? I was not disappointed.<br /><br />I loved Lola. There is no other way to describe this character than fabulous. I loved how real she was, and how she was everything I wanted to be in High School. I loved her costumes, her wigs, her two dad's. Everything about her. Even her flaws, which Stephanie Perkins wrote very realistically.<br /><br />I loved Lola's relationship with Max. If I could rewind to my high school days and my early relationships? That is the PERFECT example of them. Certain that my first \\"real\\" boyfriend was \\"The One\\" that we would be together forever, and that my parents just needed to see it. Unable to see the slow alienation of friends, of losing 'myself' all for love.<br /><br />I loved that Anna and St Clair were characters who actually gave something to the book. I would have been happy with a 2 second cameo, but getting to see them? Getting to see them still in love? I died. There was one particular scene - when they go to see Max's band and Lola is watching them. LOVE.<br /><br />I loved Lola's family dynamic. I loved her Dad's and how realistic they were. They were real parents. Who love their daughter. Who want the best for her. (Don't get me wrong, I still love boarding schools and absent parents!) I want to order one of Andy's pies for Thanksgiving. I loved Norah and the journey that her relationship with Lola took. I loved the way Lola's (and the Bell Family) History wound it's way into the story<br /><br />I loved the way that Stephanie Perkins fit all these wonderful details - backstory and otherwise - into the book so you knew everything you needed to know but it flowed so well. It's rare that this is done so beautifully, that these details are there without overwhelming the reader.<br /><br />Oh yeah - I should add. I loved Cricket. I loved everything about him. I want him to move in next door to 17 year old me. I want my own personal Cricket. So much so, that I may let my three year old keep an actual Cricket in a jar just so I can pretend.<br /><br />There is one miniscule complaint that I have on this book. Lola's Dad - Nathan. I wish I'd known more of his personality. I felt like we got so much of Andy, and Nathan was just the enforcer and all we know about him is that he's Norah's brother. I wish there were more of that.<br /><br />All in all? Now that my gush fest is over? I love Stephanie Perkins. Her books are MUST READ books for me now. I don't know that I could pick which boy I love more - Etienne or Cricket, but I don't have to! That's the beauty of it. Her books are magical, they are real and you should go read them! Now. Run. ' ' ' ' 'without overwhelming the reader.  Oh yeah - I should add. I loved Cricket. I loved everything about him. I want him to move in next door to 17 year old me. I want my own personal Cricket.

6305603847|2.0|It would have been better if the sound effects on the movie werent louder then the music in some parts. I cant imagine that someone who doesnt already like the cd would like this as a movie But if you already  are aquainted with the music this is a nice addition-some partys may be unable to enjoy this at all- that is thier way- I hope they enjoy it- some people kinda get it and to them -all the best. some pepole thinks it means alot- some alot to much. Im somewhere in there. Its really worth the $.When you listen to the cd you can paint your own-this suggests certain things happen in certain epoides- which may or may not be a reflection of reality where you live- but then again it may be. On the level of someone who has heard the cd (ookk album) hundereds of times I enjoy this as a new and different way to experiance the music. Which to some mean nothing- to others means all. Im finding it throughly enjoyable. Ive listened to them for 30 yers Its like jumping jack flash-Its a gas   and I dont have much gas left- but Im gonna spend some of it watching this. Oh year the STAR system- I gave it 2 stars becasue that was the lest populated area.

1401216676|5.0|The title pretty accurately desctribes my feelings for this book. I love Alan Moore's work--he seamlessly fuses action and philosophy together in his writing,so that you never feel bored by being pounded over the head by what amounts to an author surrogate monologuing with pictures of someone standing around, like how most comics approach this, and you never feel like you're reading ACTION GORE CHAINSAW FEST either. Even if you don't agree with what message Alan Moore is trying to convey(and I do, for the most part), you can still enjoy his style of writing--it's just that good. People have gushed on about the subject matter enough, so I'll just go into detail on the things added by the 20th Anniversery addition. There have been small changes to the art, which I must say does look a lot better, but not the writing itself, and a new story written, drawn, and colored by the comic's artist is included in the back, where he('He' meaning the artist himself) is talking about a deranged plan to kill Batman, then live an innocent life. There is also a foreword and afterword included, where the speaker casually talks about how much he loves the comic. Unless you just love the original version so much that you absolutely MUST have the anniversery edition, and I suspect that most of the people who have read this do like it that much, and then some, then I don't recommend buying this unless you haven't read it yet, in which case, WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR?! This is an amazing story! Buy it now!

B005D0RDIE|5.0|I wasn't at the Cleveland show, presented here, but I did catch the Time Machine tour, with the wife, when it came through Atlanta. AWESOME SHOW!!! These guys SHRED IT live - every song, note for note, just like on the albums! And don't ask me how three guys can generate such a wall of sound - we were on the LAWN, well up from the stage, and STILL couldn't hear each other talk! Simply amazing! My wife had heard Tom Sawyer, Limelight, and Free Will and liked those songs well enough but she became a TRUE Rush fan on this night! Sadly, I've only caught the boys in person twice but have scarfed up EVERY live DVD they've released. I'll be getting this one, too, and I'm sure it'll be high-quality - Rush DOESN'T do half-assed!
1400067936|5.0|I read this book after Taleb's Black Swan, and liked it better.<br /><br />On it's own, it's a great read, very intellectually stimulant, at times fun (with a certain degree of sarcasm) and most important, it's an original book.<br /><br />Comparing it to the Black Swan, I'd say it's much more down to earth, and Taleb's clearly less disgusted with the financial industry than in Black Swan. I'd say it's lighter than the latter one.<br /><br />Anyway, a must read for you are a scientific person (in your mind) or not.
B005LY4B0A|5.0|The menu interface is very similar to Angry Birds.  The game becomes progressively more challenging.  I like that you can receive hints for those too difficult levels.  It's nice that you can only receive one hint once per 24 hour period, it keeps the game from being too simple.
0800141806|3.0|I tried to use this movie for a court class I teach but it was not so much about the court process as it was about the actual life and story of Andrew Beckett.  Yes, it was a good storyline but if you are expecting a lot of courtroom scenes you will be disappointed.
B004I9G486|1.0|This cable did not work with my car, with any iPod or iPhone. I tried my 32GB 2G iPod touch, and then an 80GB iPod classic, neither of which worked with the car. I replaced it with an OEM MDI iPod cable off eBay, which works beautifully. Don't waste your time and money with this piece of trash.
B0055V6EZE|1.0|I'll give it one star because anything with Irma Thomas and Allen Toussaint has to get at least one star. The bad news is that they are wasted in this tribute to Laurie's ego.  Hugh Laurie is an excellent actor and not a bad piano player.  BUT-to put it bluntly-he cannot sing.  Not \\"he's just an o.k. singer.\\"  Not, as one reviewer said, he is \\"a marginally competent singer.\\"  No, he is a bad singer, a talentless singer who butchers some great  music.  If Laurie were not a famous actor with a hit t.v. series, no producer in the world would have put this mess on a cd.

B005D9MUWY|5.0|I'll admit that I downloaded this back in July, 11 when it was free for the day.  I had some doubts because I hadn't had any problem using the on-screen keyboard on my Droid X.  Wow am I surprised how much I enjoy and use this app.  Its ability to predict what word I am wanting to type is amazing.  I can frequently type a sentence by only typing the first three or fewer letters of each word.  If I had to do get this again, I'd gladly pay the few dollars they ask.  It is well worth it.  Makes me wonder if there is a similar addition to the word processor on my PC.  That would save me a LOT of time.

1592332803|2.0|I bought this cookbook because I am a devoted baker who wants to make only vegan food.  I was looking for creative ideas and recipes to help me do that.<br /><br />There were a couple of good things about this cookbook.  First, it is beautiful.  The pictures are so delicious looking and the whole thing is put together in a way that is very visually appealing.  Second, the author includes some interesting information on ingredients, substitutions, etc.  [This is why I gave the book 2 stars instead of 1].<br /><br />The recipes ARE unhealthy for the most part, but I did not have a problem with that - I bought a vegan dessert book, not a health food book.  I think criticising this book because it isn't something it never claimed to be [healthy] is unfair.<br /><br />But that aside, there was a lot that wasn't great about this book.<br /><br />You don't need to buy this book to do what she's telling you to do - you can get the same results by heeding this advice:  take all of your regular recipes, substitute Ener-G egg replacer for the eggs, sub Earth Balance margarine for the butter, and sub non-dairy milk for the milk.  That's it.  That's all she does through the whole book.  Pretty much anyone can figure out how to do that on their own without having to pay for this book.<br /><br />As some other reviewers mentioned, quite a few of these recipes are taken from other cookbooks, and I found that a bit frustrating too - I want new recipes when I buy a new cookbook.<br /><br />She is also very preachy in the book.  It annoyed me because, you know - I'm already on her side.  I am already \\"converted\\" to veganism [for both animal rights reasons and health reasons].  To have to read through a lot of ranty preaching about it got on my nerves - and it came across as very condescending.  I don't think the author wrote appropriately for who her audience was likely to be.  [People who aren't already vegan or seriously considering veganism aren't very likely to buy this book...]<br /><br />The recipes in this book aren't great either.  So far, none of the ones I've tried turned out awesome.  The flavor has been pretty good, but the textures have been really off.  All of them have been edible, but I wouldn't make any of them a second time.  I think I will be able to do better on my own converting tried and true recipes that I already have to vegan recipes.<br /><br />I bought this book based on the overwhelmingly positive reviews.  I was puzzled by how it got so many great reviews after I bought it and tried it.  In reading some of the comments to the negative reviews, I'm starting to think that this author has something of a cult following because of her shows.  I think those folks have been reviewing the book [perhaps less than honestly] because of their love for her.  I'm sure she's awesome and I support her work very much - but this still isn't a great cookbook.  I'm just saying...r /><br />The recipes in this book aren't great either.

006112429X|5.0|I just finished We need to talk about Kevin, by Lionel Shriver. This book won the 2005 Orange Prize for Fiction. It is a psychological, harrowing, disturbing exploration of several important topics which include responsibility and accountability, guilt, the \\"nature or nurture\\" question, innate evil, and - let's not forget the heart of the story - what it means to be a parent (or a child), as well as the why of mass shootings. Phew! Do you think that's enough? My sister-in-law gave me the book after reading it and warned me about the \\"difficult\\" ending chosen by Shriver. So of course, I was looking for that ending from the very start, but apart from one element, I missed it until it finally dawned on me about fifty pages from the word \\"End\\". The book is written in the form of letters addressed by Eva to her estranged husband Franklin; I thought it would annoy me, but it didn't, on the contrary. It provides a wonderful insight into what goes through Eva's mind as she initially refuses to have a child, then gives in, much to her husband's surprise and utmost joy. But things turn a little sour, as their son Kevin is nothing what they expect - and not someone they are able to understand. At all. The letters explore the relationship between Kevin and her mother, between Kevin and her father, but also between Eva and Franklin themselves. At times I found myself angry at one or the other, sad, happy or simply sympathetic, but never neutral. Having children is often not an easy (Read: natural) decision for women, unlike what many would like to believe, and this book is quite courageous in many ways. I am already thinking of quite a few friends to recommend it to. It's well written and clever. But what I loved about it is that even after finishing it, I keep thinking about what it means. It's not quite philosophical, but almost. It's definitely a great book, and I wish I had read it earlier. It's also a nice change from the crime novels I have been reading lately. Since reading We need to talk about Kevin, I have discovered that it was made into an eponymous movie this year. I think I'll go and see it if I can. It was directed by Lynne Ramsey, and stars Tilda Swinton, John C. Reilly and Ezra Miller.

B005C5A6C0|4.0|Another Fantastic Machine Head Album. Unfortunately too much of the same. The Stand out track is Unto the Locust..... A master piece ! Just  get it if you Like Machine Head. PS I like the Blackening and Through the Ashes of the Empire better as there are better songs over all on those albums.There is more aggression in his voice then also. Can't Wait till they tour Australia Again though.
