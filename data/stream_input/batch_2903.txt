B000JMKQX0|5.0|Very good book with a different spin on zombies, Made you wish the movie had kept closer to the book version could have been a 3 part series.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Love it. It's a great stressreleaf game. I got a couple people addicted to it including my six year old daughter
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|I have rarely been so ticked off at a product. Too bad Amazon doesn't have negative stars. Google is totally incapable of supporting this buggy, largely incompatible device. Unless you like gambling - stay away until this thing works in most home network environments.<br /><br />Having tested two of them, one from Google and one from Amazon, I can attest a 100% failure rate over 1 week of effort. There is an excellent chance it will not work with your router, or any particular router. Google cannot say which routers it works with, likely because it doesn't work with most. Google has zero technical support dedicated to this device, the escalation team is near useless to non-existent.<br /><br />I get exactly the same (and only) pattern using four different routers and four different clients with each of the two Chromecast units: 1 x ASUS N53 router, or 1 X Netgear N600 WNDR3700 router, or 2 x Buffalo G54 DD-WRT 24, with Windows 7 64bit Pro, Windows 7 64bit Home Premium, HTC One V Andriod 4.0, and Sansei Phablet Andriod 4.1 as \\"sending devices\\" (clients). BTW, don't keep pushing the reset bottom, which is very flaky, or re-install the app as the reps in the Google call center reading scripts tell you to do. It makes zero difference but wastes lots of time. Also be warned the device runs hot (as in toasty).<br /><br />The Chromecast app will find both the Chromecast broadcasting on its own 2.4Ghz network, then prompt for the SSID and password of the local WLAN in order to connect to the local 2.4Ghz network. [Chromecast does not use 5Ghz channels]. The app will get the Chromecast to join the local (WLAN) network as shown by the DHCP address being handed out to the Chromecast MAC address and the device becoming pingable. DD-WRT shows Chromecast requesting 140 connection that simply fade away. Windows shows the app switching rapidly between the Chromecast private network and the WLAN. The app reports failure and the TV has the message that Chromecast connected to the WLAN but it did not have Internet connection which of course is false. Google hints that IGMP is involved but has zero documentation what the device is actually trying to do. Obviously it is failing to shake hands with Google's Chromecast servers. The Chromecast is a stripped Android device controlled via URLS, but there is no way to query the Chromecasst to ask for its status. Google doesn't want that.<br /><br />I don't know what Google is doing but it obviously overtaxes many home routers in service. Likely they are exploiting rarely used protocols which push consumer grade routers beyond their capabilities or at least into poorly tested buggy territory. Google should document this and at least they could provide a list of working routers. I can attest from first hand experience that the list of ones with which Chromecast does not work appears to be extensive. Frankly I would recommend against wasting time on this thing until Google cleans up its act and come clean on which routers it works on. Be grateful Amazon is backlogged, perhaps by the time you get yours, Google will have learned what it means to deliver a consumer device directly to customers. If Google thinks this is the future of direct consumer sales, then it doesn't have one.
B00314VYNE|3.0|not the worst and not the best but my 2 year old loved it so I am happy with that.<br />The hat is extremely annoying as it comes off and pissed her off.
B005IQZB14|1.0|I did read the book cover to cover, the whole time thinking that it would eventually get better. Sadly, it never did. The entire book is a faux composite of self-loathing diatribe that continued non-stop to the 'miraculous' instant healing at the end of the PCT. It was mildly amusing at one or two points and occasionally Sheryl displayed some good writing skills. In the end though, it seems like a fake diary. I am not saying that she didn't hike the trail, but everything else seemed concocted and unbelievable. I suspect that it was an attempt to be creative or to illustrate good writing.<br /><br />In my opinion, it's an empty pointless book that doesn't even entertain. There is no explanation for it's success other than being propped up by Oprah. Don't waste your time.
B001N1DPDE|5.0|This blade is awesome... After breaking or destroying a ton of cheaper knives I thought I'd try The K-bar line.  I was not disappointed.  The minute I took it out of the box I knew I would Never need another Camp knife.  One issue,  The sheath fits so tight it takes two hands to take it out.  Could be a pro or a con.  I like that with the younger kids around our camps, but if you were to wear it on your belt (I'm not all commando) It could be an issue for the quick draw Bear fighter.

I hope that potential is lived up to in the next book.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I could not put this down.  I'm afraid I was a lousy parent that week.  Best on kindle so you can't peek so easily at the ending.
B0080SZ0V8|4.0|This was a great game. Very time consuming, though I suppose that's the purpose of online gaming. I had to search the web, forums and use the orbs to ultimately to finish. Worth the purchase! Gave . It a 4 b/c there was no way to pass in a timely matter without cheats.
B008MM9630|5.0|This game is fun and easy to figure out. The only negative thing I can say is that energy is a pain to deal with. Other than that it's a great game for all ages!

B000KKPN5C|5.0|The flash works very well as a bounce flash indoor. It is simple to use and the pictures are improved dramatically even in the day with much better contrast and skin tone. The flash recharges instantaneously with NiMH batteries (rechargeable energizer 2300 mAh). Just keep your finger on the shutter and the flash keeps going. The other good thing is that this external flash is very light and compact.<br />As long as you do not have specialized needs, this is a great flash.

B00AYB0TOW|5.0|I wish I'd trusted my gut and watched this on the big screen, but I still loved every minute on my home theater.<br /><br />This movie doesn't give us a Mega-City One with the colorful flourish, scope, or futuristic backdrop of &#34;Judge Dredd&#34; from 1995, but it also has none of the camp, and all of the dark edge from the comics. This film favors a smaller story, narrowed down to one escalating conflict in a massive super-structure, large enough to cover 6 city blocks, packed with survivors, vagrants, and felons. Through this focal point we sample how cruel and self-destructive the entire slum city really is, between the various shades of drug lords, the outgunned law enforcement, and the hapless tenants caught in-between.<br /><br />Unlike Sylvester Stallone's body-building white knight in Judge Dredd, Karl Urban gives us an unyielding para-military brute who never softens or blinks. It's not a physical presence so much as a tireless, deliberate stride of barely-contained fury. Stallone was beefy and boisterous, while Urban is a seething, weathered gunman who discards compassion as a liability and a distraction.<br /><br />Introducing Olivia Thirlby as rookie Judge Anderson with a special, classified &#34;gift&#34;, instead of as a seasoned officer, often gives audiences a counter-view to citizens' motives and emotions, which contrasts against Dredd's swift hand of punishment. Her first foray is a rough trial but it also adds a new layer to the considerations of judgement.<br /><br />Lena Headey is probably the one sticking point for me. Headey does a decent job as Ma-Ma acting bat-guano crazy while keeping all her cards to herself, but it's hard to sense any direct threat from her presence. She's an unlikely villain with a reckless abandon verging on nihilism to keep her crew in line.<br /><br />The violence is often intense but brief, except for the a few times the director takes the opportunity to prolong the gore. On special occasions, the drug-induced slo-mo extends the visuals to evoke a mental wince, and rightly so. Body counts rise abruptly as the story progresses. But the violence always has a purpose and I rarely found it wasted.<br /><br />I know comparisons between the 2 Dredd movies are unavoidable, but for my personal take the best Dredd movie would drop the actors from the new film into the landscape and technology of the old one. Regardless, I wanted to see a dark Judge Dredd and I think that's exactly what the remake delivered. I hope the sequel is more ambitious and retains the best elements from this one.-mo extends the visuals to evoke a mental wince, and rightly so. Body counts rise abruptly as the story progresses.

B00C5R8364|4.0|A great read. Coincidentally, there was a National Geographic special on while I was reading this - The War Since 9/11 - which tied in nicely with the book.
B002361MLA|4.0|So far it seems like a good book and very inspirational  My husband said he refers back to lessons learned from the book every day.
B00ESY7QXI|4.0|This movie is excellent. Great acting and some beautiful screenplay.  I would def recommend this to anyone. Now I want to read the book.
B00DNDR29I|5.0|If you don't get this album there is something wrong with you, I just bought it and this album is like a melting pot of eclectic vibes all hitting you at the same time. I love all the different elements fused together and appreciate the messages within her music. At the same time every song has its own distinctive vibe to it, (especially Give em what they love with Prince)and you know Prince just doesn't record songs with just anyone you have to be pretty darn special- but don't take my word for it actually buy it and you'll see she is one entertainer not to be pushed to the side. Love the voice and the style Janelle Monáe.
B004EBT5CU|5.0|Adele... love her voice!  All the songs are good.... lyrics, melody.  I can listen to this over and over again
B009AMAGQM|4.0|I would watch it again, because I have already bought it. But otherwise I would only rent it, it would not be worth long term purchase.
B005LAII80|5.0|Saw the film upon release and enjoyed it well enough, but with the upgrade of my home entertainment set up (Samsung 7050 series 65\\") thought I'd give it another go for the \\"3D at home\\" experience. Simply put, \\"Dredd\\" is a fantastic visual treat, worthwhile on its technical merits alone. Not in terms of the gimmicky 'pop-up' effects, but more along the lines of \\"Avatar\\": excellent depth-of-field composition, striking color palette, and stunning particle effects. Really the main negative, purchase-wise, is a lack of special features, which isn't surprising given it's a (self-described) low-budget dystopian comic-book adaptation. It's \\"The Raid: Redemption\\" without the martial arts, and \\"Die Hard\\" without the wisecracks. I don't mean this as a negative: if you love either of those films, you'll probably get a kick out of \\"Dredd.\\"<br /><br />Highly recommended for anyone as a test-your-systems product; I'd do a series with this, \\"Avatar,\\" and \\"How to Train Your Dragon\\". For the film itself, I loved it on the second watch but it's certainly not for everyone. The box art and limited marketing really don't do it justice, however. \\"Dredd\\" is a surprisingly well-crafted and immersive cinematic experience.
B0055B7IPE|5.0|Up is a wonderful movie and appropriate for everyone. Funny and moving at the same time. An absolute must watch!
B009JBZH54|5.0|Surprisingly tasteful packaging considering the garish designs on many Blu Ray collections these days. Considering that any of the individual Blu Rays run up to at least 50% of this collection's cost, it's a no-brainer for fans of the films. The caveat may be the exclusion of particular Special Features, but the film buffs who might miss these offerings probably already own the individual films anyway. I only owned \\"The Dark Knight\\" on Blu Ray, so it was an easy decision to make, particularly as I was less than enthused with the \\"Rises.\\"
B00EE3FVSU|4.0|I LOVE David Tennant!!  This series is really very good, suspenseful, well acted without being overly emotional or sensational.  Will watch all episodes.
B00BB3UYS8|5.0|Outview by Brandt Legg is a refreshingly different YA urban fantasy full of mysticism and spiritualism. 16 year old Nathan Ryder has been suffering for years with what he calls Outviews - vivid and often painfully realistic dreams. He is terrified he is going insane like his older brother Dustin, now locked up in a mental institute by their mother. His father also had the same visions and died of a heart attack. Nathan is desperate to solve the puzzle of his visions and slowly he is shown what they mean by strangers who burst into his life warning him he is in danger. As Nathan learns to handle his flashbacks so he realises what they are telling him - that he has a dangerous quest to fulfil and he must face an insidious enemy so powerful that all seems pointless and futile.<br />But Nathan has great friends who rally around him and help him through his trials and as he comes to understand the power at his fingertips - healing, time viewing and controlling consciousness through mother nature, he decides to confront his enemy and save his brother. Little does Nathan realise the terrible cost he must bear. Every page was a must read. Every chapter flowed into the next seamlessly and the book had the perfect midway turning point that upped the ante and the stakes.<br />This FIVE STAR fantasy is a must read for anyone who wonders what is out there - is there more to this mundane existence? If you want to be gripped by the scruff of the neck and dragged breathless to the last page then this book is for you.
B000U6BT40|5.0|this was my first time on amazon instant video. watched eureka season 1 on tablet (bought in 2009) and no problems whatsoever. love amazon instant video.<br />eureka season 1 was pretty good. will watch the other seasons.
B00ESY7QXI|1.0|Very difficult to watch and follow. Storyline fragmented and confusing.Watching this was not worth the rental price. Would not recommend.
B000IDEORY|5.0|Dirty Dancing is a vintage classic. The story line is kind of dorky about going to a resort on vacation which features trying on wigs etc...I mean, who would really want to take a vacation at such a place? But, The love story is timeless and endearing. When this movie was made, the dancing was indeed Dirty Dancing..but compared to modern dancing it is tame.<br />  Patrick S. and Jennifer G. light up the screen and have very good chemistry...I wish there would have been a sequel, as what happened to the couple? Did she still go off to join The Peace Corps? Did she marry him? Did she retuurn home, or stay with him?<br />  Overall..this movie is well acted and one that a person would watch over and over.
B002U3CCBK|2.0|I LOVE the film and would give the screenwriter a pat on the back for creating an amazingly entertaining film out of such an extremely dull and disappointing book.

Tom Cruise and the acting was perfectly fine, I am just left feeling like a wanted more of something, what, I dont know, just something....

B003Y5H5EW|3.0|The first three episodes were fresh and presented a continuous story line.  I cannot see how this one relates,  it has some of the elements from the earlier films ,but that is about it . It is okay but not one which l would watch again and again.
B00C2IN7CG|4.0|I have not seen this film in I don't remember how long. It must be 15 years if it's a day. So, I watched the film with relatively fresh eyes. I remembered some of the main plot elements but a lot of the &#34;hows&#34; and &#34;whys&#34; were new to me. I did not love the film when I first saw it in the 1990's, it was darker and lacking in something that made Batman the better film. Yet, I think I enjoyed this film more now than the original. I forgot how good Michael Keaton was as Bruce Wayne/Batman and Michelle Pfeiffer was an awesome Catwoman. In any case, the film looks better than the VHS and DVD versions but not as great as other Blu-Rays out there. It is better looking than the Steelbook Batman though. It also has a good amount of extras though a few less than the Batman Steelbook does. All in all, it is a good buy for the $9.99 price I got it for.
B00E5Q1LTY|4.0|Great movie, did not think they could turn the original story into a new and exciting one. Well done JJ.
B00C2IGQBA|4.0|I have not seen Batman in at least 15 years. So, seeing it with \\"fresh eyes,\\" I was surprised to find that the film stands up. The plot: A masked vigilante is taking back the dangerous streets of Gotham City, sparking a reporter and photojournalist to get the story. Meanwhile, when a criminal kingpin's \\"number one guy\\" has an accident in a chemical factory, The Clown Prince of Crime is born and gunning for Batman. I remember loving this film when I saw it at least five times in the theater. After having watched it, I still like it. It's not as great as when I was a teen but it is its own film with good performances from the three main actors (Nicholson, Keation and Basinger). The comparison of Nicholson's Joker vs. Ledger's is hard because, though this was a realistic take on Batman, it was a comic book brought to life as Nolan's films were \\"real life\\" with comic book elements. That being said, both performances are noteworthy and I love both of them. OK, onto the Blu-Ray... The transfer is decent but not very good. I'd expect that these films (Batman and Batman Returns) would warrant a more pristine presentation but nope. To me, it felt like watching a regular DVD upconverted to 1080P. It does have moments of image clarity, hinting at what might have been but mostly the image falls kind of flat. In any case, it does come with a large selection of extras including a commentary with Tim Burton (a holdover from the DVD) and all the Prince videos from the Batman soundtrack. So, with a lackluster transfer but a generous amount of extras, the Batman Steelbook is a decent deal at $9.99. But, if you see it for less, then grab it.<br /><br />P.S. - My Steelbook came damaged with the disc loose in the case. I returned it and got a replacement but it was damaged the same way and, again, the disc was loose in the case.

B00DKY4LBW|5.0|Arctic Monkeys is currently one of the hardest working bands in music and it's a title that's been earned through tireless touring, promotion, and experimentation. It seems only fitting that the band who holds the record for the fastest-selling debut album in British music history should arrive at their self-titled fifth release in top form. AM is a bustling collection of energetic tunes packed to the rafters with hooks, melodies, and the band's trademark wit, making it one of the year's best releases.<br /><br />Chances are you've had a chance to listen to \\"Do I Wanna Know?\\" or \\"R U Mine?\\" by this point. Those tracks are wonderful in their own right but it would be unwise to assume the best tracks have been released upfront. The rest of the record is ripe with deep grooves and relentless energy. The funky soul-pop of \\"Knee Socks\\" finds frontman Alex Turner crooning in a gentle falsetto that sounds so natural and confident that you can't believe the band hasn't treaded this territory before. \\"Why'd You Only Call Me When You're High?\\" is the kind of classic Arctic Monkeys tune that uses its wry humor as a springboard for a great melody and toe-tapping beats. \\"I Wanna Be Yours\\" sounds like a lost gem, its gentle beats giving way to Turner's great vocal harmonizing and the words of John Cooper Clarke. It pays off and makes for a fitting closer to the album.<br /><br />Musically the album sounds like a cross between Humbug and Suck It and See, thought the danceable beats and thick grooves are better than they've ever been. Tunes like \\"One for the Road\\" and \\"No.1 Party Anthem\\" are both intricate and direct, drawing you in with booming percussion and thumping bass propping up irresistible melodies that become sweeter with every spin. The dynamic shifts in \\"Arabella\\" make it one of the album's best cuts and it keeps you guessing right until the end, complete with its big guitar solo and crashing drums. \\"I Want It All\\" is so heavy and yet so danceable that it feels like the band's take on Metric or David Bowie. It's a perfect example of the group's continued growth and willingness to channel their sound into new avenues. This is one of their most laid-back albums in terms of tempo while simultaneously being one of their most enthusiastic in terms of atmosphere and sonic layering. It melts in your ears in wonderful fashion.<br /><br />AM may surprise those expecting something as urgent as their earlier material. You certainly won't find anything as raucous as \\"Brainstorm\\" or \\"I Bet You Look Good on the Dancefloor\\" here. However, the band's strength rests on their ability to branch out and push themselves with each release. This is one of their best to date and a sure-fire contender for the best album of 2013. They've quickly become on of my favorite modern bands and they continue to impress me with each release. If you need a fun album to end your summer then look no further than this. They've sung about the dancefloor but never before has their music been this close to it. Trust me: that's a good thing.band's take on Metric or David Bowie.

I got these after doing tons of research online and also after testing the same one my friend had, I am literally blow by the crystal clear sound it delivers, the bass is so precisely balanced with treble. I would recommend it to any one who is looking for headphones below 100 bucks. There are great reviews for headphones above 100, but I would say I am very happy with my purchase.

Not change your life (few are) but quite pleasant and light humor.<br /><br />But I write this because of something that was DRIVING ME CRAZY. I have surfed, called my automaker and dealer, but found the answer here: [...] To the question<br /><br />\\"why does this damn CD keep going back to track 1 when I get back in the car and resume listening?\\"<br /><br />The answer is, this is Brilliance Audio MP3_CD format, that only plays correctly on certain players (that my 2011 auto does not have). ARGH!
B004UPANAI|4.0|Some over the top special effects and fighting scenes. The earlier X - Men flicks were much better, than this one. One would think since this was filmed in 2009 and the others around 2001-2004. That the producers would not have over stated some of these special effects. Just was too cartoonist in some scenes for me.. But! I have always like the X Men series. Again the previous flicks were much better. One 5 star rating Hugh Jackman looked his best in this one. This man doesn't age!..

B008XG1X18|5.0|It's nice to be able to use this on my Kindle! That way I don't have to lug out the computer!
B00APUTEBG|3.0|this movie nothing stands out i guess i got it because they was nothing else available, i dont remember it being so bad that i didnt like it
B00004U2EZ|4.0|I love the original french soundtrack it is beautiful lyrics and storyline. I wish they put the songs in correct order, they are mixed up but the cast is amazing. Love to listen to this music almost every day! Worth it!
B00EYN3HTA|5.0|William O'Brien has written a book of Poems that is magical. Peter, Enchantment and Stardust - The Poems (Peter: A Darkened Fairytale 2) if you have read  \\"Peter: a Darkened Fairytale\\", you should try these imaginative and fantastic poems. They make you feel like a child again and each one is unique and creative.<br /><br />As with any poems there are always favorites. Some I liked were carefree and fun like \\"Wildflower Valley\\" and some were more dark and sinister like \\"Madie.\\" Whichever you may prefer the author does not disappoint.<br /><br />Words from these poems will stay with you long after you have read this poetry. Phrases like, watchful magic, Breath of fire, engulfs fierce and true and linking hearts forever saved. I liked so many more but you should really read these fairy tale poems and enjoy them yourself.<br /><br />I was gifted this copy for an honest review and I will gift one to my son to read to his children. Imaginative, fun and creative with dragons and elves, fairies and creepy crawlies there is something for everyone. Highly recommended and I look forward to many more delightful poems and fantasy books from William O'Brien.
B000FA675C|4.0|Suspenseful, exciting telling with wonderful details and keen cultural/religious observations.  Much better than the movie version. Felt it was a great learning experience as well.
B00DW36G32|3.0|It's good movie both actor play very well specialy Robert dinaro lots of action it's really worth to watch ..
B008B68IEA|5.0|Rec'd product in a timely manor in Good Condition.  My daughter loves playing with it and all the little accessories that came with it.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I play this game a lot I even completed the whole thing. Even though this game is free it is not a piece of junk.
B0087ZG7UW|5.0|Product Arrived on time and in excellent condition.  The film is a classic!  If you haven't seen it, you absolutely need to.
B000F0UUT6|3.0|would have loved it but one disc was missing. will reorder soon. i love the book though , which was why i ordered it.
145210655X|5.0|Arrived on time and in great condition. Lovely little book, very entertaining. Recommended for every parent who is a start wars fan!!!
141694737X|5.0|My daughter absolutely loves this one. She's always asking me to read along with her. She loves to pop open the pages and when the lion page comes up, she loves to roar like a lion!
B007NMN2US|5.0|It's fine, it is a keychain, looks like it should worked as it should.  Product arrived on time and in good condition.
0143118757|4.0|Getting to Yes is a book well worth reading. It presents sage advice on how to unlock opposing parties and moving to successful mediation through a variety of arenas. The authors put forth solid, experienced-based approaches that can draw conflicting agendas on to common turf. He denigrates much of the traditional approaches to negotiation and dispute resolution and shows step-by-step processes about how to focus on individual interests rather than cement ourselves down to opposing positions. He suggests that using an objective criteria is much longer lasting and brings faster resolution than trying to get someone to change their mind and feelings about a conflict. The authors' experience ranges from negotiations with business disputes, family matters, to international terrorist dispute resolution.
030758836X|4.0|Here is a book that I know  liked, but I forgot was was between the covers. I know it was a mystery, and that I have begun to like mysteries, I always preferred literature and fiction and some non-fiction,, but current non-fiction on Amazon is so keyed to the U.S. public it is difficult to find good.
B00DP3IESY|5.0|I'm a 3D animator and I really like movies like this as they inspire me. I do a lot of photo real work and the effects in Oblivion are flawless. There is also a very interesting bonus feature about the making of the pods that they fly around. The acting and storyline are strong but that's a subjective thing and especially fragile with sci-fi movies. Say what you want about Tom Cruise's personal life, but I find him a believable character actor and do enjoy his performances. And, how can you not like any movie with Morgan Freeman, although, his role is pretty small.<br /><br />Good story, spectacular effects and fun movie.
B009HEP41A|5.0|It is the  best novel, perhaps the first novel of all times. Leo Tolstoy was the first inventor of the genre, as I understand. It was masterful, the plot always thickeniing and thininging, convoluted yet readable, a lot of excitement about what would happen to Anna, it was a tragic novel. It is totally classical, in the sense that anyone nowadays can read it and identify with everything in it, because even if it is posted in the 1900s, the writing is universal and current. It is truest my favorite book of all time.
B00136Q6D0|5.0|This is one of my favorite Miles Davis albums. Great music and a good line up of supporting people from jazz and fusion.
0385344228|5.0|This is an excellent thriller. A father with  genetic tendency for murder, has been able to save himself from outing out his criminalistic leanings by becoming a good family man and good father. But much to his horror, his son, Jacob, has apparently inherited the murderer's drive and the father wants to protect his son from all harm. It is tragically interesting the ways in which he tries to negate the fact his son is a born murderer, but he will back him up unconditionally because that is what every good parent would do.
B000ICKPOQ|5.0|I was really impressed with the quality of this spin-off.  I had been a fan of Stargate SG-1 since it first aired and was glad that this show lived up to that.  I own all five seasons and watch them again and again.
B009Q6ADG0|5.0|I loved the themesong of this latest of James Bond's movies, and I looked up whose song was the soundrack lead: It was Adelle, Well, both the composer and the singer and the arrangers conducted a mystery of a beautiful song, that always becoms me badk to the movie when I listen to it on my MP3.
B0083SBMBM|2.0|I was recently organizing my DVDs and noticed that the cover art of the DVD I received is undersized, and upon opening the case (I don't often get a chance to view all my purchases immediately) I discovered that the DVD is an unmarked disc. I ordered a &#34;used like new&#34; DVD and apparently have a bogus item. My livelihood is dependent on copyright laws being honored. Discovering a fake is especially offensive. It seems I've been swindled.
B000024C7W|5.0|I discovered this album in the late seventies or early eighties, and was struck by how different it was from all other of his albums, it had a secret! I have bought and rebought this album twice, because initallily we hadb it in an a longplaying record form, and got rid of it for discs when times changed, but it was a mistake becuase many people keep turntables, and we should have kept this album , and many others we through out. But I am happy t have it again. I put the top title, The Secret Lives of Plants, on my husband's IPod and he was very happy. Or I brought him a CD for himself, I can't remember, but it should brings back beautiful memories of those times. Very sexy songs
B00AZMFO6I|4.0|Strong roles by a stellar cast.. Loved the supporting cast of English actors and musicians of great reputation. Good buy.
B00D0Z2J10|5.0|Standard DVDs are $40 on amazon japan + 20 something for shipping overseas, this movie will be released stateside but Funimation does not expect anything earlier than 2014 and probably late 2014.<br />Personally I do not care for the English dub and will just use subs when available.<br /><br />I pre-ordered the limited edition which came to a total of $108.45 which includes $20.08 shipping, the standard blu-ray would cost $37.14 + $20.08 which is $57.22.<br />I ordered the limited steelbook version from Amazon, not the regular limited edition, there's a $30 difference.<br /><br />The movie itself is good, but ordering anything from Japan be it dragonball or any other franchise is not cheap, they are not in a recession like the states.
B00ARF93AQ|5.0|It is a really Great movie<br /> My family and I enjoyed it. We would love to see more movies like it
B002G1YPH0|5.0|I Have a Phenom x4 965 CPU at Factory Clock Speed etc, but my CPU was getting to 50C on idle during the summer (no air conditioning!!)<br /><br />With this Heatsink, not only does my PC stay below 50 C (even when running Crysis 2, or rendering at 100% CPU Load), my whole PC is quieter than ever!<br /><br />Worth The Price!
B00EE3FVSU|5.0|It's a very good story with great acting, accents hard to understand sometimes but I find it very entertaining.  I look forward to it weekly.
B00138D3VQ|5.0|On the cusp of greatness... You can hear the influences on them and even more their influence on later bands!
B00AZMFK3K|5.0|This movie should have been the the #1 box office winner of the summer. If you missed it at the theater, get the Blu-Ray and watch it in a great home theater. You won't be disappointed. Exciting, visually dazzling, fun, AND smart. It wins all the way around.
B00AECGQF2|5.0|My daughter really seems to love this game. She enjoys creating silly haircuts and making the faces look strange. She keeps coming back to the app over and over (so it appears to have staying power). My son enjoys seeing her pictures but not actually playing the game. She's always been more creative, so that might be why.
B00AYB1RGG|3.0|This is a popcorn action movie with a cool electronic soundtrack. It's fun. If you're expecting more, like an amazing script, you'll be disappointed. If you're okay with little more beyond techno and explosions, then I would say this is worth checking out.
B008KE3960|5.0|Hours of fun, even for my little guy who is 8. Easy to control, quick to learn, and a great time killer
B003JH8LPW|3.0|After reading his Da Vinchi series of books, and even Deception Point, I gave this a shot.  It was interesting enough to finish and funny that I was reading it in the middle of all this NSA news.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|Definitely goes into more detail than the series I cannot wait to finish the series. A very quick read even though it is drawn out
B00632HWOG|3.0|Yahoo keeps trying to evolve...that's good.  However, unlike other products, software tweaks and module changes often find a way to leak their code changes into other pieces of the total product, hence, my indignation with Yahoo/IE.  At least for me, it is a common occurrence to have the inability to even access Yahoo unless I change to FireFox.  Even Chrome works better than IE when using Yahoo.  I don't have those issues with Hotmail or GMail, though GMail and IE don't always play well together either.<br />I also think the interface needs some help....meaning, why should I have to click on a separate page to bring up My.yahoo when I am in Yahoo Mail?  I should be able to seamlessly move between them....as in already loaded and ready to switch views.  And please fix the calendar.  Yahoo COULD make 'life' so much easier to navigate if they really wanted to.<br />Ok, so its free, and I don't really mind the ads when they are pointed in the direction of things I buy anyway.  That can be a nice service and a win-win for both me and the advertisers, but get the targeting mix right.  I am 59, male, and don't buy earrings or shop at cosmetic stores.
B00B1ME11U|2.0|I love Clutch. This album is ok. I am sure it will grow on me. My problem is it does not transition to vinyl well at all. It's very tinty with minimal low end. If you want to buy this album download it or get it on CD.
B008673ZAQ|4.0|If you liked the first book, you'll like this one too.  It had the same intensity as the first book, if not more and was a fast reading book.
B000XUBFE2|4.0|A terrific read, I was engaged from the first paragraph.  I smiled and cried as the beautifully wrought characters took their place in my heart.  Told with compassion and humor
B004QZ9PLU|3.0|Not one of my favorite books.  The story started out slow, which made it hard to get into the book.  About a third of the way through, it started picking up and the story came together.  The ending was really good though.
B005MJFA2W|5.0|This excellent book presents a good model of the human thinking. But as Kahneman himself points out, this is not how brain works, it is just how it looks like if one examines it as a black box. This model, however, really explains a lot about the human irrationality. Also, the book is superbly written and is a joy to read. Let's see what we will think about this model in 20 years.
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|As with the second book, this book was a great continuation from the previous book.  The down side is that the story doesn't end with this book and you find out that there will be two more books.
B00CFYAT6O|5.0|Derek Trucks has been a favourite of mine for a long time, now that he has his band with his Wife, I think they are really good together. I love the stuff they put out !!!!!
B00DDZM0GQ|4.0|It reminds me of Tetris and Collapse.  So if you like either of those games, you'll probably like this game.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|The Kindle ereader app for android systems is great for reading books on any android device.I use this app for reading all the time.
B00589BMF0|2.0|The HD version was not worth the money. The movie was still very grainy and out of focus often. There were times when the picture was nice but not all the time. It was nice to watch in wide screen.
B00AZMFJYA|5.0|This is a wonderful movie that keeps your attention from start to finish. Once in a while there is a little shadow of one of the mighty Star Treks--almost like a auditory flash-back-flash-forward kind of thing. This movie presentation of the characters in their younger years is utterly believable. I LOVE THIS MOVIE! And the icing on the cake? Amazon and UPS proved that getting it to my residence literally overnight without usurious charges to do it, can still be done. USPS: wake up and pay attention! Thank you Amazon--you've done it again!
B00DC3DGSK|4.0|This is classic sounding Chicago blues, with some of today's star performers from other genres joining Buddy for a highly entertaining album. If, like me, you enjoy Chicago blues I think you'll listen to this many times, as I have already. Great for listening to while driving.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|Fun to watch. I would recommend this show to anyone who wanted something to waste an evening in mindless stupor.
B006LSZECO|2.0|This book didn't sit well with me.The need for profuse bad language and vulgarity took away from the story.  The author had a clever plot, but I couldn't get past the language and enjoy the story.  I read it for my book club and can't wait to participate in the discussion tonight! I would NOT recommend this book to anyone. Sad to think that this book made the Best Seller list....
B00EY8BRGU|3.0|Overall this was a keep you on the edge of your seat thriller / thinker. It kept you in sixpence, on trying to figure everybody's roll in the movie unroll when you finally find out and left me totally off guard, I usually figure out the mystery but this one got me. I just wish the ending was a little different.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|This was such a great season of ups & downs. I love it, well done. Catch up and watch the last 2 seasons, and this one. Worth the time.
B003Z0BWT0|5.0|I couldn't put my kindle down !!! Full of unexpected twists and turns!!! I was so sorry when it finished
B00607EWYC|5.0|An amazing concoction of words and phrases and verbal illustration. Harding put me in every scene to hear each sound, smell each fragrance, touch each surface and taste each adjective.  Thanks, Paul, for a wonderful day with George, Howard and their loved ones--known and unknown.
B001NLKZUA|4.0|These books are great! I just wish she could wrap things up a little into a happier ending. Of course I will read the next one in hopes of finality.
B005LAIISA|5.0|I got this for the kids and they love it they have all three and there are times they sit and watch all of them
B0031RAOVY|5.0|I did not order this dvd  I bought one for my sister when she was in the hospital..this is really a great movie not sure how it came up<br />that I order this threw your company. I did not receive this item
B005LAIHQS|4.0|I got this for my brother and he likes it and says he watches when he has friends over and has loaned it out
B00CDT41RY|5.0|While it was very entertaining, and I enjoyed it, it was quite long.  Other than that, no complaints.  Non stop action.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|It definitely made me look at things differently. Definitely a very interesting book that shouldn't be missed. Can't put the book down.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|Grab your tissues.  You can't read this one without crying.  Full of metaphors about life through racing and a dog's eyes. And don't worry, it has a happy ending.
B0036S4B6M|5.0|Definitely a page turner.  I think every middle class woman wonders what it would be like of happenstance took her to prison.
B005FISBTO|5.0|Hate this is the last season. Was behind on the series, so catching up now, finally. This one (#6) is as great as the previous seasons...They are ALL 5 STARS SO FAR!
B00BWWS81S|3.0|I think she's a really good songwriter and I really like her music.Some of the songs I like more than others, as with anyone's music.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Couldn't put it down. MY KINDLE FIRE HD WAS ON THE CHARGER TIL I FINISHED. I CAN't wait for the finale
B00DQBWLSO|3.0|I was surprised that it's mostly a country type feel. But I enjoy his voice and there are a coupla songs on the CD that I really like alot
B0007TKNL0|5.0|Ten Stars would be more appropriate.  Emmy has the most beautiful voice I've ever heard and at the age of only 16 (when the movie was made).  Andrew Lloyd Webber's masterpiece...
B00CM9JKQM|4.0|I took my time to review this so that I could give it a thorough listen. This has been my favorite band since roughly 1985. I have been disappointed in the breakup of the band as well as the ugly aftermath. That being said, I am so very happy that Queensryche is attempting to re-create the \\"sound\\" and \\"feel\\" of their creative heyday. This album is a step in the right direction and I am impressed by Todd La Torre's contributions to this offering. His voice is obviously similar to Geoff's but with a grittier lower register.  This is my take on \\"Queensryche\\". I decided against a track by track, as I feel this album is meant to be listened to from beginning to end.<br />\\"Queensryche\\" is a mature, layered album. My opinion is that the musical road the band was going down was one with a dry, grating sound and pithy songwriting. The vocals were below the standard they had set, and the one thing they truly lacked was depth. Depth in the writing, the sound and the feel. This is the sound of musicians coalescing and maturing into the band they wanted to be after DeGarmo left. I recommend this album period. I am grateful that the band I once thought put every other band in the world to shame has emerged from that crappy period of music with a really good offering. Kudos!
B0083Z614S|5.0|When you are in the mood to be uplifted by the faith of children in what is good and right you should read this book.
B009O07NMA|5.0|I love it!  This is by far the best cd that I have purchased in a long time!  Love it, love it!
B0083Z614S|5.0|Saw the of movie and broadway play based on the book but never read it. Delightful read for kids of all ages. No wizards or gadgetry here. Just beautiful garden to entertain the old fashioned way.
1402770006|3.0|I ordered this book along with the Sign of Four by the same team. I love the stories and it is fun to see them in a graphic form. The art is fun and fitting for the stories and the writer did a great job of adapting the novel to fit into a comic.<br /><br />Unfortunately, for how fun the story and the art is, the paperback is poorly constructed. The binding is cheap and the cover has fallen off of both books while reading (these are short reads and will only take a few hours to get through).<br /><br />I returned one and was sent a new copy very promptly. Regardless of the new copy, they all seem to fall apart after a short time of reading as the cover of the Sign of Four started to fall off this morning.<br /><br />If they have the option of electronic, go with that as the book wont fall apart on you.
B008JFUO36|4.0|This movie was a favorite of mine, the soundtrack, graphics, acting and plot all helped make this movie awesome. The plot twist in this movie is one I was not expecting and that turned my whole view of things upside down. An excellent movie if you like, Tom Cruise, Sci fi, a great plot and some drama.
B009GN6DT4|5.0|Gets better every time I watch it . A classic for sure. Five stars this movie is a ten. I know not the only that thinks so.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game is good but if it put it like the pc version then it will be a lot better! good but the pc version is the BEST game ever!!!!!!!!!!!!:)
B00DUGCLY4|4.0|As per the other reviews it does make you think more. Some are quite obvious while others are a little tricky.
0399255370|5.0|I like the fact that the different colors can lead to a lesson on aspects of personality.<br /><br />It can be read by a younger child but child needs to be older, 5 or 6, to get the full benefit.
B007VYDFMS|5.0|One must see it. Very well done and described by the people involved in his life.  You will found out many fzcts that you probably even knew.  :-)
B00821PCJS|5.0|The show is very realistic for a science fiction project.  The aliens look real even though a lot of cgi work is done to create and animate them.<br /><br />I like the fact that the father and son relationships are sincere and the brother to brother relationships are too.<br /><br />The work has impacted me by deepening my sympathy for the problems faced by people in bade situations.<br /><br />Other customers should know this is somewhat gory at times when people and aliens are killed.<br /><br />I would compare this to Revolution without the aliens.
B007JOM0GC|5.0|I just like this album.  All of the songs on it are good.  I would recommend this album just for everyday listening.
B00E3D7WGU|4.0|This review is for the crazed fan seeking the best of the best of this show. I have nothing to say about the show it self, it's epic in every aspect, I know it, you know it, moving on. The audio levels on this CD are going to make you go, \\"huh?\\". This is rather surprising when you consider it went threw 3 \\"official release\\" dates that span 7 months stating editing as the cause of the delay. I assure you this is the official disk put out by Madonna herself. I put that in because you will question if this is so when you hear it. It is kind of bootleg sounding. The vocal levels are too high and the band is a little too distorted. The result is like hearing your friend sing at kerokie (or how ever you spell that). It is a clear sound, it is the full concert, and it is not unlistenable (I thought I just made up a word but spell check is giving it the green light.) However, I do find this ironic when you consider how many bootlegs have been floating around ever since the show opened. I will admit to listening to and viewing many different ones who seemed to have a better balance of back and fore grounds. If you are that fan that is looking for that epic recording of this epic show, talk to the pirates. If you are that fan looking for a decent recording to take jogging with you, or to have on while you clean the house, then don't just stand there, let's get to it, buy this now, there's nothing to it.
B00B97TMIE|5.0|Every song on this album is great!  I listen to it over and over again and never get sick of it.
B009XIXVU6|3.0|It stared off great and looked like it would be a great story, but about 3/4 through, it just lost me. No fun at that point and I quit reading. Could have been just me, but I just did not enjoy it.
B00EH49DXA|5.0|Katy Perry rocks, do I really need to say more?  I have listened to this song over and over again!
B008RA3X5E|2.0|I purchased my alarm clock to get more songs because the free version works so well with just one song. On the third night, My Alarm Clock failed to sound the alarm. Instead I got a message on the screen  that there was a problem that prevented it from sounding the alarm as set. Because I am going on a trip to Europe, I can't afford to have an alarm that sometimes does not work. I go back to the free version. I think there is a software glitch since I selected a song instead of the free version that sounds the alarm with the same song.
B009VLXMJA|5.0|Taylor has grown up a little in these songs.  The album overall is a bit slow, but still good.  I have always enjoyed Taylor Swift's music.
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|Clocks works great as advertised. Easy to use. I was so happy that I decided to upgrade it to My Alarm Clock for .99 cent.
B00873GRU4|5.0|i just loved the whole series. i couldnt put it down. it is rare forme to become so engrosed. great book, great series. Im off to read more Hugh Howie.
B009RX7IX8|5.0|Like usually this is great Castle. It's hard to stop watching but you have to do other things too. I would recommend to anybody
B00CDT41RY|5.0|I had glanced over reviews for &#34;Django&#34;* and I was curious as to how such an assembly of characters would join together to create a well-written tale full of surprises. Each actor brings their own identity to make a movie where the sum of the parts far outweighs each individual addition. Watch this movie with just a curious notion and you will be pleasantly surprised.<br /><br />*The &#34;D&#34; is silent.
B00DSTBMMU|4.0|Over the years Shery Crow has moved slowly into a more natural, accoustic, folksy feel at timed dabbling in country. Now she's gone country without all the twang. To me, it's a country take on Sheryl Crow. It's a good sounding album. I gave four stars because it's not her best work but it's good. I'm not the biggest country fan but I could listen to this album over and over. Because it's not a full blow country album but rather sounds like a country take on normal Sheryl Crow style I can easily recommend Sheryl Crow fans take a good listen.
B00EE3FVSU|4.0|Interesting story that grabs attention from the beginning. It does not take long before a person has interest in the characters and the direction of the story.David Tennant is an excellent actor who breathes life and a little mystery of the tale.Can't wait to follow along with each episode.
B007L6VR12|5.0|I enjoyed every minute of it. This movie is adorable. My daughter and I both love it - she's 20
B006RXQ2CY|5.0|Helen Mirren is amazing as the Queen of England.  Her portrayal of Her Majesty during the trying time after Diana's death is poignant, touching and believable.  The look inside the lives of Her Royal Highness and those around her was well done and truly revealing of the pressures and concerns brought on by (sometimes misunderstood) ancient traditions and modern ideologies of Great Briton.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|this is great fun for all ages and keeps u flicking away for hours. think it would also make an excellent computer game for the likes of nintendo ds, 3ds and wii
B001NLL93W|5.0|Just something different to read. There is never a dull moment, and when you think you know what's going on, you get hit from left field with something new and threatening to the characters. It's an easy great read.
B0064X7FVE|4.0|I'm very happy with this app. Considering it was free I don't have any problems with it. I like the detailed information it gives and the map. No adds or pop ups are a great plus!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is so addicting.  It's fun running,  jumping and avoiding obstacles, while at the same.time collecting coins and other goodies.
B00000DQR4|5.0|This box set here is a collection of singles and their respective B-sides from the 1995 album Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness. As this is The Smashing Pumpkins at their prime, even their B-sides and outtakes sound like album-quality stuff.<br /><br />Each EP is grouped into similar music, such as the raw and heavy Zero EP, the acoustic Tonight, Tonight EP, and the Bullet with Butterfly Wings EP, that mostly features cover songs.<br /><br />Twenty-eight (not including the singles already on MCIS) great songs of vastly different emotions, there's something on here for everyone.
B000A7DVR2|1.0|This is a terrible movie.  I guess most of the lemmings love this crap because it's cool.  I thinks it's one of the worst movies ever made.  Maybe that's why it never made any money.
B0012GTZC0|5.0|Only read at night but couldn't go to sleep once I picked it up. The suspense was definitely there until the last page.
B00AYB0TOW|5.0|I was highly entertained by this post-apocalyptic, violent, comic movie. Ma-ma is a great villain, not highly sexualised (which almost never happens in films anymore). The videography is beautiful, conflating drug use with violence. It almost makes me want to read the comics, and I hate comics. I have watched this movie over 5 times.
B008B8AOQI|5.0|So I heard the song &#34;Let Her Go&#34; on the radio while driving, but they never said the artist!  The tune stuck in my head as did the artists unique voice.  Luckily I was able to &#34;Bing&#34; those few words I could remember (let her go) and after listening to it again on YouTube, ordered the CD.  Of course Amazon gave me a free download as well and I was able to listen to it to my hearts content while waiting for the CD to ship (2 day shipping for Prime members is awesome!).  I listened to that one song over and over, maybe cause it seemed like it was written based on my own love life, hehehehe, but eventually I listened to all the other songs and found other favorites.  Admittedly this music is not what I normally listen to, and the artists voice and accent is unusual, but it does grow on you.  You have to listen to the words, if you like songs of life and life's lessons, you'll probably like this.  I'm going to check out his other CDs now!
034580404X|4.0|So, they are definitely a fun read and the story-line is okay.  I was just very let down on the final portion of the final book.<br /><br />As you read the first book (Fifty Shades), it is somewhat difficult to 'get in to' because the first few chapters, I was thinking to myself, &#34;I would let my 12 year old read this!&#34;.  No sooner I said that, then the first &#34;f&#34; words came flying and never ended. I put that aside, as it seems most everyone these days uses the f-bomb in everyday conversation and settled in to enjoy the story-line.<br /><br />The sex &#34;scenes&#34; (and there are plenty) are almost continuous as expected.  There wasn't much about the books that shocked me though, it was almost very predictable from the very beginning.  Beyond the sex, the story-line is very engaging and the end of each book makes you want to read the next (with the exception of Fifty Freed, the third book which has a poor ending - almost like an afterthought, it just doesn't flow well with the rest of the book).<br /><br />I don't regret purchasing this set, but I don't believe I'll be re-reading them every few months either like some of my other book sets.
B00CTSDDVO|1.0|Amidst the news that Paramount has decided to split the Bonus materials created for this movie across several different exclusive releases (including iTunes and Target), I have taken this item off my wishlist and refuse to give Paramount any more money until they get the message that fans will NOT be pushed around anymore. Let your voice be heard, speak with the only thing these cretins understand... your wallet. By refusing to purchase this Blu-ray you will stand up to the greedy corporate monstrosity Paramount has become.
0060765488|4.0|I order this book for my grandson and the audio book so he can read and listen at the some time
B004W2UBYW|5.0|The story of Steve was told in a careful detailed manner, yet was so personal and heart felt. It shared the ugly and wonderful alike, and led the reader through a complex tale of success with plenty of challenges. Whether or not you are a fan of Apple products is irrelevant, this story is moving and enlightening.
B000NQRE9Q|5.0|We are HUGE Indiana Jones fans (we are actively ignoring that last bit of trash, thank you very much) and couldn't wait to see movies 1-3 on blu-ray.  The quality is great, and the behind-the-scenes footage is exceptional.  Well worth it for the the hardcore Indy fan.
0060512806|5.0|For both the science minded history buff, or someone who likes a great story told well. This has it all.
B00ECU4DPW|5.0|My Little Pony is the rare children's series that is also entertaining for the adults watching.  My daughter had caught the end of this on the HUB channel and was instantly bewitched by the Equestria Girls, a weird hybrid of teenagers and their pony counterparts. I was really excited to see it available so readily through instant video.  It is a fun series of episodes and has the typical humor and songs that make My Little Pony a fun past time.  Just a word of caution:  the villain in this episode, Sunset Shimmer, is pretty frightening and gave my daughter nightmares.  She is newly six and had nightmares when she saw the Queen Chrysalis character featured in the the season two  2-part finale of &#34;A Canterlot Wedding&#34;.  If your child is somewhat younger or more sensitive to characters like that, you might want to monitor the episodes closely with your child so you are available to minimize any fear this may raise.  All in all, this is a fun take on the My Little Pony series and is fun, entertaining, and visually beautiful.
B00E8KLWB4|3.0|I've only played the game for a few hours.  There are other puzzle games I enjoy more. It's not quite as intuitive as I would like. It's frustrating when it discusses details on the bottom of the screen but doesn't show it long enough to read it.
B007TXN4TK|4.0|I like the demo songs that come with the game, I really am trying to learn guitar, I just thought I would give this a try is all. It is good.
B0060V1WJ6|5.0|I can watch this over and over again. Fantastic cast and writing. Even my hubby found it funny..highly recommend it!
B00CXVX1OQ|3.0|Great time killer, it is not Tyson's punch out but it is great when sitting in waiting rooms or need to kill time
B00DDXJRJG|5.0|The sound difference this app makes is good. i would recommend you get this. It doesn't take much to get it up and configured.
B00BFUUMO8|4.0|This game is really fun, but to get missions completed in the game it can get expensive and it keeps you playing
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I liked this book. Sad to see it end. Although I'm not sure about how I feel about the Christian part. Overall it is a great trilogy.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|I really got this after seeing Despicable Me 2, I like the Minons and this game just hit the right spot really fun
6305212112|5.0|It is so 90s in fashion, but still is a good movie.  The movie is based on a wonderful story
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|This is a very good app and is simple to use. Even I someone who's learning their was around technology is able to use this app. I recommend it to anyone with a tablet or laptop. Maybe even a PC user.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game is probably the best game i have ever played<br />But if im going to stay happy mojang needs to make it more like pc<br />They should add redstone and maybe add better monsters<br />And make portals<br />But otherwise it's a great game
B005TKD6NY|5.0|With NW, he has provided an insight into how complex our brain is with respect to work and your daily chores, yet so frail when it comes to decision making that involves our near and dear ones.. The detail with which he approaches every single thing - you feel like the narrator, watching every move from a distance..
1582701709|5.0|When I have a friend, stranger or relative that is going through something in their life that isn't about happiness, I give them this book. It has completely changed my life.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I loved this story, the characters in it made you really think about everything that was happening.. They say you Don't meet your soul mate when your little but maybe some people really do.  This book just shows me  what I already know, that little kids now more then what they let on.  Kids maybe small but the know........ very touching story.  Loved it
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I had my reservations about the story line, but ms. Colin's pulled it off.  Looking forward to reading the next one.
B00466HM28|5.0|Just want to say thanks for even putting this up for purchase. made a big difference. been using the computer keyboards for YEARS
B004W2UBYW|4.0|Beautifully Honest and direct.  A picture of tormented soul in search of peace.  A picture of someone outside the box.
B008GXHOFW|5.0|The thing I don't like is that the game costs,oh and the the last amazing Spiderman movie  came out on my birthday and there's going to be an amazing Spiderman 2 next year on 2014 and today is Tuesday,Septemeber10,2013
144476490X|5.0|This book is a version of James Bowen's original book, \\"A Street Cat Named Bob,\\" that is appropriate for young teenagers and older. The meeting of James and Bob, the cat, in the hallway of an apartment building in London is only the beginning of their adventures. The softening of some of the more graphic aspects of drug addiction and homelessness has not taken away from the major theme of what unconditional love and caring for others can do in broken lives. A very appropriate book for the age group. The color photos add so much to the story.
B004P1JEXE|4.0|As with all the other in the series. A page turning, good read. Addictive. Remember to read from book one!
B000XUBFE2|4.0|I am going to have to think awhile about this story. How to process and describe it? I loved the narrator's voice. The characters will not soon leave me.
B00CRWJ7VC|4.0|Freaky at the start but well worth it.  Really fun to see the actors morph into so many different roles
B005MMY9A8|4.0|Fast Action Packed!!  This was a great movie that my 14 year recommended we watch together.  It was a good choice for age appropriate options for parents and teens
B00DGNOMB6|5.0|Well written and well acted delightful movie. You don't have to like opera to like this movie. A great find.
B0089LOG02|5.0|I had never heard of the orphan trains until I read this book.  I loved the way the story kind of brought together the present with the past.  The story of these children and how they were put on the train and given away to just about anyone that would take them was heart-wrenching.  I wasn't crazy about the way the book ended but I still loved the book.
B00AYE8C70|1.0|Horrible.  It takes your entire contacts list and sends it to their server.  If you deny access it wont let you use it.  I'm sorry but this isn't the 90's... privacy matters to people.
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|Enjoyed the touch hide and seek type of hidden object, but strictly only one type of puzzle which gets very repetitive. If you enjoy word searches you would probably enjoy this type of game, which I do enjoy, but not as a game to play through a storyline. More like a casual hobby.
0307887898|3.0|If you've taken any marketing courses and have worked within an Agile framework where it is bottom up - there is nothing new in this book.  There are however many misconceptions out there as this is the \\"buzz\\" right now.  There are some things that I would like to point out.<br /><br />1.  None of the things talked about in this book were \\"innovations\\" they were improvements on what was already in the marketplace.  In short, learn from your competition.  I like to use many of the things found in Harry Beckwith's book \\"Selling the Invisible\\" (GREAT BOOK BY THE WAY - but it is not full of mechanics - more high level mindsets).  One of the things he talks about is \\"What would the other guy do\\".  I.E. if you were going to attack \\"you\\" or your position, how would you do it?  how would you break down your own defense?  There's your weak points, fix those.  Patting yourself on the back while your gate is unguarded is a failure that many make.<br /><br />2.  The trend seems to be - people that aren't doing start ups love this book,  people that are involved in start-ups are questioning the viability of the ideas, particularly Angel investors and VCs.<br /><br />3.  This has been around for a long time  \\"Ready.Fire.Aim\\" is not new<br /><br />4.  This has very little to do with actual Toyota Way LEAN.  Calling it \\"lean\\" was a great way to capitalize on a well-known process.  Kudos to Erick for that excellent marketing position.<br /><br />5.  The accounting practices in this book will get you in trouble.  Look at Groupon and what happened with them regarding GAAP.<br /><br />6.  In Eric's own words from an interview he did:  \\"There is no such thing as you should always do X. It's all about what's contextually appropriate. There is a time and a place to raise money time and a time and place to focus on design. People will say, \\"I want to do what Steve Jobs did.\\" Well, you might not be in the same position as Steve Jobs.\\"<br /><br />7.  If your product is good - Lean Startup may help,  if your product isn't good - Lean won't do much except show you failure in your experiments.  If you are \\"in love\\" with your idea and can't let go - this will get expensive.<br /><br />8.  No one is immune.  He talks about Kodak in Chapter 4 and uses it as an example.  Kodak declared bankruptcy in 2013.  No one is immune or above it.<br /><br />9.  Sometimes, you can pivot too soon.  Timing is important.  Sometimes you have to just wait for the market to catch you.  Have funding in the mean time.<br /><br />10. Scatter shot approaches aren't new, nor are \\"Innovation Factories\\".  Think \\"Think Tank\\".  Livermore, Rand, IBM, DARPA, Los Almos, Oak Ridge.  This is what they do.  But...they are funded to do exactly this.<br /><br />11. It seems that every product he discusses essentially is a money maker due to 1 thing.  Advertising.  Every product seems to simply be an Ad Consumption System.  Google - 95% of their revenue (and climbing) is ads.  What about those that want to make an actual product?<br /><br />12. Think about using Lean Startup in your daily life.  Can you afford to fail that often?  Sometimes there are things that are product critical, know when those things are in front of you. (Lean Startup - medical equipment?  bad idea)<br /><br />If you are new to marketing, entrenched in the old large-company way of thinking, or have never worked with well-done product design and management (Good marketing agencies have been doing all these techniques for 30+ years now), this book will open your eyes.  If you aren't new to these things, this won't give you much to work with that you don't already know.  Experienced people, particularly people that have practical marketing experience or agency experience will read this book saying every page or so \\"well..DUH.  how is that new?\\"

B00ADQCBEY|5.0|We received a recommendation from a friend about this series. I was not too impressed after the pilot but wanted a couple of more episodes. If you like cops and gang type of bad guys this is the show for you. Strong characters some that you love to hate, action, emotion, this is the show for you. Watch two or three and you will be hooked for all seasons of this excellent series.
B000MQC9H4|5.0|this is one of the great love stories in my mind.  although i do enjoy the jude law romance better than the jack black romance.

B000I0XLYO|5.0|So many silly barbs at an industry that takes itself way too seriously.  Great movie if you are looking for something fun to lighten your load.
B00EY8BRGU|5.0|Let me first start off by saying that I'm a writer, because of this, I'm pretty good at figuring out the ends to movies before they happen, while most movies now are very predictable for me, this one had an ending I didn't see coming. Jesse Eisenberg and Isla Fisher are possibly my two favorite actors and in this movie they did not disappoint.  I highly recommend this movie to anyone who likes action, mystery, and magic.  While I know sequels are NEVER as good, I can honestly say I'm hoping for a sequel on this one.  Still skeptical, rent it from Amazon or a movie store before buying it, or even *cough*Redbox if you must (I am very ticked off with Redbox and refuse to use them). Give it a shot, and see if you can figure out the ending.
B00AZMFK3K|4.0|I've been a fan of the Star Trek films and TV series for many years now. My favorite of the films remains Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home--but I've really enjoyed J.J. Abrams' take on the Trek universe. What I've loved most about this franchise overall, however, is not the sci-fi elements or the adventure or the special effects (which were amazing!), but the characters. The crew of the Enterprise is a wildly diverse group that has somehow produced just the right chemistry. They're not just a crew, they're a family. In the face of overwhelming danger, they come together in the way families do.<br /><br />I'm pretty sure this is no longer a secret, so no spoiler alert--in Star Trek: Into Darkness, Kirk and company have their first face-off with the notorious Khan, who appears on Earth with an offer to help a couple whose child is dying. He can save her, he promises. But his offer comes with a price...one that will lead to the deaths of many members of Starfleet, including Kirk's mentor, Christopher Pike (Bruce Greenwood). Kirk and the Enterprise crew set off in pursuit.<br /><br />The young Captain James Tiberius Kirk (Chris Pine) is what anyone familiar with the character in his later years would expect: brash, stubborn, daring--but always with the best intentions. And with a middle name like Tiberius, one can assume he learned to fight at an early age. He is, as Admiral Pike puts it, Starfleet's \\"only genius-level repeat offender.\\"<br /><br />Spock (Zachary Quinto), by contrast, is still trying to be all Vulcan, in spite of his half human side. Kirk brings out that human side, which frustrates Spock. Kirk has a nasty habit of giving a single-finger salute to logic. He might not break the rules, but he'll bend them beyond recognition, the way Uri Geller used to bend spoons.<br /><br />The negatives? I was disappointed that a pivotal scene from Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan was borrowed in this movie, reversed to have Kirk dying to save the Enterprise as Spock did in that film. If one is going to rewrite Trek history, don't include retread scenes! Also, I never bought into the relationship between Spock and Uhura--there was never anything in the original series to even hint at such a relationship, and it seemed to me it was contrived to give the character a stronger presence in the story. It wasn't necessary. Uhura is and always was a great character without the romance angle.<br /><br />All of the actors (Pine, Quinto, Karl Urban, Simon Pegg, Zoe Saldana, John Cho, Anton Yelchin are spot-on in their roles. (Okay, I do have one question: how is it that Scotty, in his later years, has so much more hair than young Scotty? He really is a miracle-worker--or those 23rd-century replicators are just that good!) Benedict Cumberbatch as Khan brings just the right degree of brilliance and menace to the role. I would have preferred he be a more complex villain, like Tom Hiddleston's Loki in Thor and The Avengers, but still I'm glad the character wasn't killed off--there's always the possibility he'll return in a future installment (and I do hope there will be future installments).that film.

0679746048|5.0|This was a great book for our daughter - teenager.  Her honors English teacher was impressed with this book as a free-reading option.
B00D6BQPMM|3.0|It could have been great. It was just eh. They did something interesting and rushed it. It felt undercooked to be honest.
B00ECUARO8|1.0|Boring! I made it 15 mins into this terrible train wreck before I couldn't take any more and had to shut it off.
B004YCKJSS|5.0|I already owned this movie but ordered it as a birthday present for my niece.  I love this movie.  The characters are people who you actually care about.  The whole storyline is something that actually is common to a lot of people that age - trying to find yourself and decide what to do with your life.  It is a completely believable movie and is my all time favorite!  I have watched this so many times I know the lines before they are said but I can still watch it over and over. I absolutely love Timothy Hutton in this role.  Matt Dillon also gives a great performance.  Needless to say it is now one of my niece's top five favorite movies and she says its the best gift she got this year!!!

1476712042|1.0|Travis is the Harley riding bad boy on campus. He lost his mother at a very young age, which, in turn makes him afraid to care about anyone in the event that they too will leave him. So, he fills his life with drinking, fight matches & meaningless sex with hoardes of women, all the while never allowing himself to feel anything. That is, until he meets Abby, and he instantly knows she's 'The One'. Sounds like another perfect love story with a gorgeous tortured hero, right? WRONG!<br /><br />Travis isn't tortured, he's a mentally unstable maniac desperately in need of psychiatric treatment. He flys into murderous rages, beating men to bloody pulps if they so much as dare to breathe near Abby. His love for her is so intense that it borders on seriously unhealthy obsession.Tell me what is romantic about a violent, manic-depressive man with rage issues?<br /><br />And what does our heroine think of all this fighting & violence? She loves it, in fact, she encourages it! Driving away from your boyfriend at high speed, then hiding from him in a friends dorm room is just another day in Abby's 'beautiful' relationship with Travis.<br /><br />I read this book like a thriller. I kept waiting for the moment when Travis would finally snap & drag Abby off into a dark alleyway or stuff her into the trunk of a car.<br /><br />This isn't a romance novel, this a cautionary tale about abusive relationships. And now there's talk of making it into a  movie!? No no, this story would be better suited to a Crimes of Passion episode on the CI channel.
B00BESM14U|5.0|Really enjoyed this movie. Brought back bitter sweet memories of being a young adult and feeling invincible. Deals very well with sensitive subjects and leaves you feeling hopeful and with some faith in humanity restored.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|this game is a total blast to play.. easy levels. fun for the whole family. only thing is you have to spend money to make any real advancements.
B004R13U6Y|1.0|Could not open up any of my PDF documents.  Uninstalled it an hour after I purchased it.  Would like to get a refund.
B00AYB0TOW|4.0|I liked the action in it, but what I did not like was the slow motion (very fake) scenes when some of the characters were on the drug. I get that it showed the body's reaction to the drug, but it simply was wayyyyyy to clearly animated.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|Loved it!  I could not put this book down.<br />The book is so much better than the movie.<br />I'm glad I read the book first.
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|I don't read very much so in short. you'll love it. If you like gaming and old school movies and music buy,buy, buy!

B002ZG98UK|4.0|I am not really into these kind of movies but the 3D on this one made it pretty good. It was a scary plot.
B00DC3DGSK|5.0|Buddy graced us with a double CD of more of his great music. It reminds me of hearing him live and listening to his soulful voice and his expressive guitar talking. This is a must for any fan of Buddy or anybody that listens to blues. I can't wait until be puts out another disk.

B00064WSNW|4.0|&#34;Discipline&#34; finds a revitalised Robert Fripp and Bill Bruford joining forces with (then) new members Adrian Belew and bass supremo Tony Levin.  Listening to it in 2013, it's hard to imagine that there was a time when the &#34;chorus&#34; pedal on guitar sounded cool, but indeed it did for an ephemeral period in the early 80s.  Fripp and Belew take advantage of this and ultimately it's this timbral ingredient that most sounds dated 30 years later (particularly on an otherwise compelling &#34;The Sheltering Sky&#34;).<br />Crimson fans know what to expect: bizarre time signatures, a penchant for chromaticism over sweet consonance and unusual instrumentation (chorus pedal notwithstanding!).  This music that can be otherworldly in its beauty and yet at other intervals, it's downright irritating.<br />At times Belew's lyrics sound as if they have been spuriously superimposed on the music - as if they were inserted later as an afterthought rather than growing organically out of a process of group composition.  That said, this album is nonetheless a high point for New Wave quasi-electronic rock in an era that yielded a lot of 'flash in the pan' rubbish.  Highly recommended!
B00DHQHAH0|3.0|This is a good show overall but I liked Season 1 much better. The cases are not as good and I didn't really like the Hardman arc that much. But the show is still pretty fast paced and accurate (from what I can tell). So I will watch Season 3 when it comes on Prime for sure, but I will be going in with my expectations a little lower.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I liked the strengths of the supporting characters. The storyline was easy to follow as each book was an extension of the next. I felt as though the main character, Anastasia Steele, had read Why Men Love Bitches written by Sherry Argov and was aptly demonstrating how to apply its philosophy. Well done!!
B0084U0IEG|2.0|The constant inner chatter of repeating previous exposed feelings gets in the way of the story. I read 50% and just could not go on even after several tries.
B006MW3UZW|1.0|streaming stopped  two to three times during viewing. It was very annoying and support did not help at all. ok
B005K17RU0|5.0|On the Kindle this is a better app. than the Weather Channel. The page lay out and access to more sites and great graphics makes it a winner.
1567184855|4.0|Michael Newton opens a door to understanding who we really are and the idea of life between life's only proves to me the truth of reincarnation. A great book and a great read !
B005FISBTO|4.0|I truly didn't like Colin Hanks.  True, he's Tom Hanks son, but he cannot act.  He's stiff and unbelievable.  EJ Olmos was amazing though!
B00BQPEIT2|5.0|LOVE this game/app! I'm not a big game player, but this one keeps me interested. The scenery changes. You can add different features to mix things up. And it's as challenging as you want it to be depending on whether you want to play the daily/weekly/level challenges.
B00915G6WQ|3.0|Deborah allowing and even shooting LaGuardia?!  Sorry, don't by it.  She's still a cop and has been on of the few who's been a rule follower.  Doesn't jive.
B00DBSZJRM|1.0|I typically love this genre. And I don't always have to take things too seriously. But this broke every rule of believability and quality entertainment, using modern language in medieval settings and just going above and beyond attempting to entertain anyone who still has a brain cell intact.
B007VCMGPM|5.0|John is an absoutley fantastic guitarist. One of the most &#34;complete&#34; players I've ever heard. This disc has a little bit of everything. Definately worth buying.
B002VPE1WK|5.0|I bought a camera bag when I bought my new camera a couple of months ago. When I saw this on amazon, I thought it was worth the added expense. Man, was I right!!! A typical bag does not have enough room for all of the equipment, plus keys, phone, wallet. This has room for everything, and I can keep my hands free for the what I'm out there for in the first place! Love it!
B008469DGY|5.0|This a great game. Awesome graphics and great control. Great content as well. Great way to pass the time. Best golf game out there.
B005GY0Y8S|5.0|This woman never really figures out the murderer until it is almost to late to save the people she cares about. I also love that her man does all the cooking.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I think DowntonAbbey is the best show I've ever seen on TV.  I'm very disappointed that Mathew was killed off.  He and Mary were a great couple and he is so handsome.  Can't wait for season fout.
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|It wasn't perfect but it was certainly the best movie of this type so far.  There were only a couple of bad words in it.  I wish they would just leave them out so that I don't have to memorize where they are and mute when my kids watch.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game its better than temple run and its cool because its different countries you are traveling to:*
B003H4I4JU|5.0|I enjoyed this book even more than Ender's game due to the depth and complexity of the characters.  There wasn't quite as much action but it was very good.
B008HJGPVO|5.0|I love this stylus! It's the 3rd (different) one I've bought from Amazon, but this one has 3 different size ends. Its's great.
B006DGOV9Q|5.0|Awesome product, in regards to the new battery I received. As for the battery itself, its a chame to have to replace it after having the phone only a couple months
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This is a great game.  It is both challenging an fun for all ages.  It definitely gets your mind thinking.<br /><br />[...]
B006LSZECO|1.0|the device of telling the story through the eyes of two different observers was cumbersome and caused me to loose interest.
B005K17RU0|5.0|I think that it is really nice to be able to look and see what the weather is going to be tomorrow !
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|This book like all his others is funny I think it was worth the wait a book for all kids
B0080SZ0V8|5.0|was a really awesome game. problems weren't so easy to solve that I was bored but not so hard thar I got fed up with the game
B007HACDLK|5.0|Vince Flynn books are amazing, Real page turners, can't put them down, a master at suspense, in a way that is enjoyable and not annoying.
B004X80QNG|5.0|This is a very good app. It does exactly as advertised. I use it almost every day. Well worth the price I paid.
B00169XU8I|5.0|Since her downfall from Erotica, Madonna strikes comes back with a bang (although &#34;Confessions on a Dancefloor&#34; was an improvement) that shows why she is the queen of pop, being able to reinvent herself! The music is fresh, dance, and again Madonna continues to put out good music! I brought the original cd for &#34;Hard Candy&#34; and this deluxe box makes it better, because it is bigger than the jewel case and it's hardcover. Buy it!
B008469DGY|4.0|This is a very good app. It does exactly as advertised. I use it almost every day. Well worth the price I paid.
B000FCKGPC|4.0|With everything and all of the surprises that took place in book #3, I guess the author had to give his readers a breather?  He achieves this slight break in the action in book #4.  So, compared to book #3, this one is very good but not great.
B00EY8A6BC|5.0|This was a great movie with a great plot and great actors! Very entertaining. Would with out a doubt recommend to anyone.
B00ECU34ZM|5.0|Lots of cool stuff in this one, as well as plot twists.  Would recommend this to anyone who enjoys scifi.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|It's all about simplicity. This is a no brainer for those who don't have anything remotely similar. If your tv is \\"dumb,\\" and you don't own a roku, apple tv, ps3, etc. Then this is a no brainer! Even if you have one of those stand alone products with the netflix and youtube apps, I'll tell you why you should still buy it. Products allowing you to play netflix or youtube on the big screen are not new, but that's not the point of the chromecast. The chromecast is all about the \\"HOW.\\"<br /><br />Because of this dongle, I'm watching more and more netflix and youtube on the big screen. You know why? Because chromecast is the closest thing to feeling like the app is a part of your regular cable line-up. In the past, If I'm browsing and messing around on youtube, I do not bother to fire up the PS3, and if I own a google tv or apple tv, I probably wouldn't bother turning on those boxes either. It's just faster to browse with your keyboard and just watch the clips on your notebook. In the past, watching Netflix on the big screen is something I had to prepare for. I have to browse and search on my smartphone or notebook first, add the movie that I want to watch to my que, then turn on the ps3. Because highlighting letters with your controller pad is stupid and impractical. And the funny thing is my TivoHD has a netflix app too, but highlighting letters on the tivo remote was even more excruciating and worse than the ps3.<br /><br />Hence, this is why the \\"HOW\\" part of the chromecast is so awesome. You're already browsing and searching with your smartphone or tablet, now just hit play. No need to power up anything else. No need to buy mouses, air-mouses or media center keyboards for your roku or ps3. YOUR SMARTPHONE DOES IT ALL!!!! That's the point folks! No extra mouse, keyboards, or accessories cluttering your coffee table. And you can still use your smartphone to do anything else you want. The chromecast is processing the video from the cloud. Your smartphone is free! That's why I say it's the closest thing to feeling like Netflix and Youtube are a part of my cable line-up. I can get to these apps quickly! No need to power on anything else or fetch keyboards and controller pads. That's why we hardly watch youtube on the big screen. The hassle is not worth it for short videos. With chromecast, we've been watching more youtube. When a few of my family members are sitting around, I always take the opportunity to cast a few funny videos, or share interesting videos I've seen. In the past, would I bother to ask everyone to huddle around my notebook, fire up the PS3, or hdmi out my notebook to the big screen? NOPE. Another cool thing is that anyone with a smartphone can start casting videos too. You can show a funny video, and your friend or family can try and top you with a funnier video from their smartphone. This is something that you cannot experience with any other product out there.<br /><br />Of course, they need to develop this and add more apps. As it is with just Netflix and Youtube, it's already worth the $35. When they develop more apps, especially an app that will allow us to play our own videos and view photos from the cloud, then this dongle will be the bargain of the century. Right now, you can play local videos by loading the video into your pc's chrome browser, then cast the tab. But this uses your computer's processor and if you view in full-screen, then you can't do anything else with your computer. I consider this a \\"work-around\\" and I hope they give us a dedicated app soon. Also, this \\"work-around\\" is not possible on your smartphone or tablet. Even if it was possible, it would use your phone's processor and eat up its battery. So those complaining about this, just be patient and wait for a real dedicated app.<br /><br />We are creatures of habit, and this chromecast happens to be very compatible with my habits. I understand my review may not sound appealing to someone else who has different habits. But if you can relate to some of the things I just wrote about, then buy it, you won't regret it. If you don't like using your Smartphone for everything, then don't buy it. But then I would have to ask, why did you buy a \\"smart\\" phone? I think you would be missing out on it's capabilities. You paid up the wazoo for your smartphone. Use it for something else other than texting! I read a review where the person said they rather have a dedicated remote because they don't always have the smartphone on them. Seriously, think of what you're saying folks! If I called you right now, you wouldn't pick up the phone because it's placed somewhere far away? I don't know anyone who stashes away their cell-phone to the point, they can't hear it or reach it. C'mon, stop resisting! This chromecast is awesome and it simply makes sense! The more you resist, the more you don't make sense. LOL!<br /><br />-------------<br />SET-UP TIPS<br />-------------<br /><br />-If phone set-up isn't working, go to notebook. Vice versa, if notebook isn't working, then set-up on phone.<br />-When it fails and says TRY AGAIN, close the app.<br />-Disconnect router, reconnect router. (sometimes, magical things happen when you disconnect. The router just figures itself out.)<br />-Disconnect chromecast power, reconnect chromecast.<br />-Start Set-up App again and try it again.<br /><br />I have two chromecast and my first set-up was one shot and smooth. My second chromecast took some fiddling, but I did those steps above and it connected. I also took it to a friends home and tried it on his network. When it failed, I did those same steps above and it worked again. I highly recommend doing these disconnecting/reconnecting tips before spending hours on the phone with a rep.<br /><br />-----------------------<br />9/11/2013 UPDATE TIPS<br />-----------------------<br /><br />-In my review I mentioned that your notebooks is rendered useless when you cast full screen to your big tv using the chrome browser. I learned that if you hit the ALT+TAB buttons, you can regain your notebook while the tv is still casting your movie in full screen. Awesome! Keep in mind, this is still a \\"work-around.\\" It's not ideal to watch a movie because the streaming is crappy and your PC is processing. Ideally you want the Google folks to create more apps like Hulu, Amazon Prime, etc. Casting from the browser is ideal for photos, presentations, etc. I wouldn't recommend it for movies.<br /><br />-To cast Amazon prime in your chrome browser (from your notebook of course), uninstall microsoft silverlight. Next time you play an Amazon movie, it'll ask if you want to install silverlight or use adobe flash. Choose adobe flash, and enjoy!e to some of the things I just wrote about, then buy it, you won't regret it. If you don't like using your Smartphone for everything, then don't buy it.

B00ARA4SLU|5.0|&#34;Hitchcock&#34; with Anthony Hopkins and Helen Mirren is an outstanding film .  Hitchcock and his wife, Alma were an unbeatable movie making duo. Alma was a film editor by trade and she worked on many of Hitch's screenplays. This film dealt with the making of the Hitchcock masterpiece, &#34;Psycho&#34; . The director, Sacha Gervasi, had a good handle on the material and used visually interesting shots. (No hand held camera shots. Bravo !!) There is also a good performance by Scarlett Johanson as Janet Leigh.<br /><br />Highly recommended .
B005UG542S|1.0|There has not been one movie that has been uninterrupted when watched on my Roku. Amazon just can't get it right. Netflix never has a problem. It's sloppy programming, perhaps, but they may want to ask their competitors why it works so well for them. . Come on, Amazon, get it right!  This time, it stopped dead at a crucial part of the plot. Never fails to predictably wreck a good viewing experience. Not just once, but every Amazon movie I've watched. Get better at it folks. Roku will be around for a long time and it's arrogant to assume that it's not a high priority to fix this problem. I know I'm not alone. Others have complained. It's all over the web.
B004WKH4PS|5.0|This is a great film, I love Joan Crawford in it. Classic. This movie is definitely worth the watch, so watch it!
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|I love the color scheme, it makes it very easy to keep it on the nightstand while I sleep.<br />Wish you could alter the colors randomly, maybe have them cycle through a range.
B000063DHL|5.0|Title says it all.  I received this album on time and in excellent condition.  My husband loves this album which was a present.
B009XIXVU6|3.0|Having read previous books written by the author I had great expectations.  Not so much for this novel.  The narrative was hard to follow in the latter part of the book...leaving you wondering why some of the characters were even introduced.  Disappointed yes...expected much better from this gifted and talented author.
B007FKI9G0|5.0|Funnier every time I watch, and the brilliance of the satire means you keep discovering subtle jokes missed before.  A favorite.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I downloaded solitaire for my Kindle Fire.  It works just like the solitaire games for Iphones etc.  If you lose a game, it even gives you the option to see how to win.  Great Game!
B00E5Q1LTY|5.0|very good. just watch it- why read all of our stuff - you will like it. a lot! a lot
158270208X|5.0|I love this handy little book.  I see it at my bedside everyday and it reminds me to take a few minutes to be grateful with what I am and all that I have.  It also reminds me to be grateful for all I am becoming and am receiving.  :) Thanks you!
0307277887|1.0|If you are looking for a book that relates to the show that will give you as much as intensity as the show. This is not it. Stick with just the show. It is a very slow moving book and this is all just season one of the show. So clearly the show was able to put ALOT more detail in. LOVE the show not a fan of the book

0385363125|1.0|I'd begun reading this book just out of curiosity to see what \\"everyone\\" was raving about?<br /><br />My own observation(s):  \\"fans\\" of this book must be drooling, blithering, love starved, bon-bon swallowing morons to even consider this to be worthy reading material. It would take a very special, mentally under stimulated, lonely person to get a charge out of this book. I gave the book away to someone who lives next door to me (she fits my above description).<br /><br />The banter is dull/boring. You need to use both hands for this book to stimulate the senses, but I'll leave it to the reader imagination as to what I'm talking about.<br /><br />And the Audible version that I downloaded for my sister is REALLY NOT WORTH LISTENING TO! Don't remember who was doing the reading, but they mustn't pay these people very well, and therefore have a hard time trying to find interesting personalities with good voices. VERY MONOTONED, emphasis, and the way it's read, is VERY offbeat with the way anyone else might read it to someone. I wouldn't read a bedtime story to a child as badly as the female who provided the vocals for this novel did. It's VERY clear that the reader was neither professional or well-practiced.<br /><br />If this is a Trilogy adventure, count me out. And the movie... I'd guess it will be as big a stinker. In theaters today, and vanished after the first 2-3 weeks, only to show up in the \\"cheap\\" bin at WalMart.
B000RO9VJK|5.0|This book is excellent for people like me who are trapped in a rut with their businesses. This book with give you the strength, tools and motivation to make changes and move forward.
B0022Q8CSC|5.0|A great book. The in-depth emotions and accounts make this a superb tale.  The great crime mobs come to life. You care about the characters and at the same time are put off by their actions. An absolutely enthralling and engrossing experience.
B00B0ND67K|5.0|The three voice compliment each other perfectly!  The country/pop blend makes it a real pleasure to listen to; I like it better every time I listen
B003MAOTP2|5.0|I enjoyed this movie completely!  The acting was superb, the storyline believable and overall the movie seemed very authentic.  Especially when it was telling a story that followed many of the aspects of a tumultuous time in the history of mankind.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|I adore a book that makes you think parts are about you and yours!  What a delight. Thanks so much.
B000U0F7RG|1.0|I got this for Christmas and I'm just now getting around to watching. After season 1 pretty much every single disc skips and stops.  I believe it's the cheap cardboard sleeves that scratch up the discs. Of course it's too late to return so I'm stuck with a worthless DVD set. Don't waste your money, buy the individual seasons instead.
B00DNDR29I|4.0|When Janelle Monae hit the scene in 2010, she was intent on taking no prisoners. The arrival her debut, The Archandroid, signaled the emergence of a breathtaking and multitalented new pop star who could excel at a wide variety of styles scattered all across the musical spectrum. The followup album forges ahead in the directions suggested on The Archandroid, but pushes them to even more dizzying heights.<br /><br />The Electric Lady, which contains Suites IV and V of her ongoing Cindy Mayweather saga, is balanced around a finely crafted dichotomy; Suite IV is generally characterized by high octane, explosive dance tracks featuring larger than life synths that draw influence from an array of various eras, while Suite V relaxes the pace and gives Monae the chance to impress on a series of shimmering ballads. She wastes no time getting started on \\"Givin' 'Em What They Want,\\" unquestionably one of the most defiant, foot stomping blasts of attitude unleashed on public airwaves since Queen's \\"We Will Rock You.\\" A space age guitar solo laid down by none other than Prince himself gives the piece dramatic flair while simultaneously driving Monae's point home.<br /><br />One of the most defining characteristics that sets Monae apart from her pop music contemporaries is how her songs often progress and develop into something more than they were when they began. \\"Ghetto Woman\\" begins as a very loud, synth driven 80s pop/R&B stunner before transforming into a hard hitting piece of socially conscious hip hop. Similarly, the closing track \\"What an Experience\\" starts off as a mid-tempo ballad before adding in gospel influences and picking up the pace to end as an optimistic number delivering a message of hope.<br /><br />Over the course of the disc's 67 minute run time, she covers all bases by touching on funky 70s style beats (The Electric Lady), smooth soul ballads (Primetime), chilled out jazzy numbers (Dorothy Dandridge Eyes), and even mellow Spaghetti Western ballads with a classic, old school feel (Look Into My Eyes). She also shows an uncanny knack for being able to contrast styles. \\"Dance Apocalyptic  sounds upbeat with its jangly 60s girlpop, but its subject matter discusses topics such as the end of the world and a zombie outbreak in Atlanta. She also has no shortage of friends to help her do her damage. Erykah Badu makes a minor guest appearance on \\"Q.U.E.E.N.,\\" but Solange's guest spot on \\"The Electric Lady\\" is a bonafide sizzler.<br /><br />The warped and wigged out nature of The Electric Lady's opening tracks provide for a much quicker burst of pleasure than The Archandroid. However, The Electric Lady also feels much more like a product designed for mass consumption than The Archandroid. The opening sequence of songs comes across like a series of tracks vying strenuously for mainstream radio airplay. Some of the melodies begin to wear thin after repeating plays, and the ballads tend to lack the emotional weight supplied by some of her contemporaries in the R&B field.<br /><br />However, it's Monae's specific approach that makes her such a fresh, invigorating  and adored artist. She adopts a futuristic, spacey, and funky philosophy hinted at by hip hop duo Outkast, but not really suitably explored by many well known artists since then. With the release of The Electric Lady, Monae seems primed for her biggest break yet.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Really fun game. Just challenging enough without being frustrating. Was great fun for my 7 year old grandson too. Hope too see more levels in the future.
B003B02O0A|5.0|Outstanding!  Read it years ago. Still my favorite book of all times. Read must of it standing up.  It's as if I know Carl Lee, Jake, Lucien, Harry Rex, Ellen, the Sheriff, Tonya, Gwen and Buckley personally.  John Grisham is genius.
B005OCHOZS|4.0|I first came across Scott Jurek in Christopher McDougall's amazing book, Born to Run. In Scott's autobiographical &#34;Eat &Run&#34;, it was fascinating to read about the man and ultramarathon legend from his own perspective. Not always happy and rosy, this book is honest, insightful and a compelling read from start to finish whether you are an ultramarathon runner or not. In fact, I am simply a casual runner but still enjoyed this vivid account of Scott's legacy so far. As an added bonus for vegan runners, Scott peppers the book with some tips and recipes for healthy, plant-based snacks and meals.  It's an inspiring companion to Born to Run and highly recommended.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|Works just like it's suppose to, it is a good length which is nice and it's durable with movement (ie. areas around connection don't seem like they'll split easily.

B00ECU34ZM|3.0|At first I thought I was  really going to like this movie but it didn't keep my interest. It had a great twist in the middle of the movie but got some what predictable after that. Worth watching but nothing very special.

B0035JNTA6|2.0|If you like off the wall people trying to me strange. Then this is it. Ben Stiller was not very good in this.

1439196834|1.0|A big &#34;HIMYM&#34; fan, I bought this as a stocking stuffer.  It was okay, but it could have been better.
B006RZFACU|5.0|As usual Peter Collier doesn't fail to come up with the goods. A delightful rhyming tale of what happens when a town is covered by a thick fog.<br />The characters are enchanting and the story which unfolds is engaging for children and adults alike. You cannot fail to enjoy this writer's rhymes.
143911000X|2.0|I bought this as a gift book, for a big HIMYM fan.  It was a bit entertaining, but nothing inspiring.
0989524116|5.0|I was give a copy from the author in exchange for an honest review.<br />Having read the first instalment of this trilogy, I was eagerly anticipating this second novel and it certainly didn't fail to build on the brilliance of the first.<br />Continuing the exciting but intense journey of Nate, this book is a must read if you enjoy thrilling, fast-paced action. This story drew me painlessly through the pages  as I eagerly followed the fantasy and danger faced by Nate.<br />The previous book was excellent and this continues as brilliantly with new characters as well as old favourites in cleverly described settings.<br />Having now completed two of the three I can't wait to read the final book in this fantasy series.
B0081336FO|4.0|You never really can go wrong with a Shelock Holmes movie, even if it isn't one from way back when. These two characters make a very good team in the 21 century. Besides a rainy afternoon is the best time to view good movies.
B005ZI2X4I|5.0|I bought this book for my three year old son and as usual with a Peter Collier book he was totally mesmerised by the beautiful illustrations and great rhyming tale.<br />Offered as a warning to adults against the decision not to permit the building of snowmen when the snow comes, this is a delightful read for children and adults alike.<br />A well-deserved thumbs up!
B001FA0W5W|4.0|It is said books find us, this book found me.  I thought I was the only person that thinks all the \\"news\\" out there is noise.  Although I am not a true believer in randomness I enjoyed this book much
B008BF9ZFM|5.0|I love this author's rhyming books for children and so do both of my boys aged 3 and 10. The characters in this tale of a sleepy village which comes to life on just one day a year when the Fishing Derby occurs is full of charming and individual characters.<br />The tale is amusing as well as cleverly rhymed and just as with all the author's other books, it will not fail to charm.
B009K0P10K|5.0|All the actors are so appropriate for their characters.  Love the theme and the surprises that occur in most episodes. Madeleine Stowe will always be Victoria when I see her in other films.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|This book is one of the very best I have read.  I worked as a public school teacher for 35 years and am retired and this book brought<br />me to tears, laughter and other emotions as I read it.  It was fantastic.
B005FQ2H8W|5.0|My family used to own this movie on VHS when I was a young child, and I loved the movie then, as well as I do now. I buy everything I possibly can new so to deter from any playing flaws in the movie, and this movie played like what I bought it as, which was new
0802130208|5.0|The problem with most reads today is it's so rare to find one that's genuinely funny. Although I originally read this many years ago, upon re-reading it, I did find some aspects very dated, but the humor is rich and timeless. It's a fun romp through a crazy town with equally colorful and crazy characters.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|its a great game. the concept is great. I really like it. I recommend it to anyone who likes to wheel
B005XN31LY|5.0|See my comments on Season 1. Same goes for Season 2 so far! I'm not much for watching TV, only occasional movies. But this one is more than captivating! I've been watching it marathon-style!!
0345525558|4.0|This was a well-written book with an engaging story, believable characters, and thought-provoking themes about the power of love, perseverance, forgiveness, and redemption. I was intrigued to be introduced to the language of flowers and realize it is a long and honored tradition, even though there are variations on what each flower means.
B009JZTOG8|5.0|I had never heard of this series until Netflix 'suggested' it to me. I became addicted to it! I started watching Season 1, and continuously watched all the episodes for 12 hours. The episodes stopped playing after #12 on Netflix, so I went to Amazon and purchased Seasons 1 and 2 to watch instantly!  I'm on episode 6 of Season 2. I usually hit the sack at 9:00 pm, but since I discovered this series, I've been going to bed around 1 am!
B0038P59A0|1.0|We stopped watching when we realized that this show had taken a turn for the occult. It started as a fun and different Sherlock Holmes mystery but at the point that Sherlock started invoking incantations and black magic to be able to oppose the bad guy---we turned it off.
B008RXYOKY|5.0|Worked as advertised to allow me to connect my firewire audio interface (M-Audio ProFire 410) to my new MacBook Air (2013).
B00CPTUNBK|5.0|I loved this movies! Music and story was great to me as well as character design!<br />I wish derpy was in this movies
B000XUBFE2|5.0|The Book Thief was a surprisingly moving and heart wrenching piece of literature. A new point of view on one of the most horrific times in world history. Beautifully written, captivating, and all around an amazing read.
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|If you want the convenience of generally casting from your devices to your TV, and can buy this with the Netflix promotion, then it's a deal.<br /><br />However, given all the hype around this device when it was introduced, it's only OK.<br /><br />Generally, the rule of thumb is this will cast anything viewable within a Chrome browser to the TV you insert it into.  However, if you, like me, do a lot of your browsing in Chrome browser's incognito mode, you'll be disappointed that, at least for now, you cannot cast your content in incognito mode.<br /><br />Also, text quality could use improvement.<br /><br />Frankly, you can get equal, and sometimes superior, video quality using a video / AV cable connecting my computer(s) to my TV.  But Chromecast makes wireless casting convenient.<br /><br />I'm on the fence when it comes to recommending this device to my friends.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|very fun game, I am 15 and I love playing it!! It has goals you have to do and events to compete in!
B009LQKHIO|4.0|I enjoyed this book and am anxious to read more in this series. It was one of those books I was sorry to see end.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|I loved the different viewpoints & how all tied together. It was a unique story line & mature view of live & relationships.  Issues are resolved but not in stereo typical way. I like the conclusion that some things should remain unknown & secret. Karma seems real.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|If you really get stuck in this game there is help to nudge you along, you can use it if you really need it or not.  I thought it was really fun. Hope they come up with another one!
B001AQO3QA|5.0|The set arrived promptly and I enjoyed it very much. Would recommend for any Alien fans. Have watched the DVDs several times.
B007XNAQL0|5.0|One of the best concert films of all time!  I have owned it on VHS, DVD and now Blu-Ray and the quality is well worth the price.
B005C0DHEY|5.0|Was very educational as I was not familiar with this process. It shows how much big oil interest care about the communities they come into. I recommend this movies to open people's eyes to the down side of this process.
B00AYB0TOW|3.0|It´s a simple movie with a simple plotline. its like a hbo tv show chapter, but has the spirit of the comicbook
B00338QELU|3.0|Combination of Chinese and Swedish influence interesting. Some aspects implausibly strained. How to find the only man in Beijing? It is agood tale
1936608898|5.0|Checked this book out from the city library 4 mos. ago. Liked the book so well I bought a copy for me and a copy for a friend. Started using diet info in book and Inflammation in shoulder is gone. Still have mild arthritis but the pain is gone. Had an x-ray at Drs. office before I went on diet and showed positive for mild arthritis. I don't know how well this diet would work for severe arthritis but it does work for mild arthritis. Don't know what type I have, just know that after 6 weeks it quit hurting.. Also, I feel better. I haven't really lost any weight because of this diet but I do have more energy. Over time the increased energy should help with weight loss - I hope.
030758836X|3.0|I enjoyed the book, but have absolutely no respect for the characters after reading it!  Amusing read if you have the time.
B0081JPTCQ|5.0|Love it. Eat pizza. Stay cool. Hi people.Hello. Chocolate. Google. Free. Using.get. I am now a tongue and the first bell pepper spray paint ball
B006IGZWB2|5.0|Great way to share history. Both funny and sad and those right amount of both. Characters and actors were fabulous!
B004Z2TUGE|3.0|Nothing earth shattering but a good movie to pass a few hours. I will watch it again someday just to see what I missed.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|After a long day of work, I unwind with this game. It's fun and relaxes me. I love the colors and how easy it is to get the hang of it.
B00AZMFK3K|5.0|this is one of the best Star Trek movies ever, also the price for the Blue ray and DVD combo is excellent.
B00CTSDDVO|5.0|Left the package in my paperbox at the street. We get electronic delivery of the newspaper, except for the weekend. It could have gotten stolen.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|I liked it because of the quest mode, and because its the 1st time I see a MAh gong with different kind of tiles. It also kills time very well.
B00DDXJRJG|1.0|I can not tell you how the product is it didnt down load right it is not showing up on my iPad
B004XUMMFE|5.0|Perhaps the greatest science fiction tale since (or even including?) Star Trek. Great storylines, humor, and plot twists...it is too bad we never got to explore the whole 'verse.
B007IWG3WC|4.0|Eye opening and informative.  Well researched and on point.  Describes how our government is transforming our country into a Marxist mess.
B0081JPTCQ|5.0|Easy to Use. Lots of tools and styles for pages and notebook covers. Many fonts. I especially like the ability to write in my owN writing.
B008MG1E4A|3.0|First, this book is a far cry from Marchinco or Haney. The writing is juvenile; the details contrived. (I hope he doesn't track me down and kill me for that!)<br /><br />Second, there is no way DEVGRU would kill Bin Laden if there were any way to take him alive. There are no credible death photos on the net. There is a studied lack of detailed information in the media, and in this book. The book confirms that Bin Laden was unarmed. The SEALS could shoot out his knees in less time than it would take to say BOO, so why destroy the best source of intel US counter-terrorists would ever have? Short answer: they didn't. They Tasered him, drugged him, showed his &#34;body&#34; to the hysterical wives, rolled him into a body bag, and lit out for home to start a years-long debrief. Of course, this is just my opinion, and I am in the distinct minority (people who think). I believe that this book, the movie, and the contrived investigation into whether Bisonnette leaked classified material (give me a break!) is nothing more than a cover operation.<br /><br />I think the funeral at sea was nothing more than the sacrifice of some poor sailor's laundry, sent over the side in place of a body. Bin Laden is probably locked in a concrete cell deep in the earth, pumped full of psychotropic drugs, with electrodes taped all over his torso; by now the man has been downloaded.<br /><br />Still, the book was mildly entertaining.
B001NLL93W|5.0|It was a very good young adult read, but kind of predicable.  I would recommend it for ages 12 and above.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This a fun game that continually keeps you interested with something to do. I would strongly recommend this game to anyone who loves horses or who gets bored easily.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Works just as my wife and I planned.  Would recommend for anyone who has to do their check book on a regular basis, or shopping at the store.
B009X01FJS|4.0|I love the 'made for Kindle Fire HD 8.9' case.  The only complaint would be that you can't close the case while the Kindle is charging. Otherwise, I think it's really nice, looks good, love that is swivels... only one I could find that would do this for this Kindle.  A little pricey, but worth it in the end.
B0064MPXFA|3.0|STARTS KIND OF SLOW, BUT KEEPS YOU INTERESTED. I REALLY LIKE THE GIRL COMBINATION WITH THE ATTORNEY AND THE INVESTIGATOR.
B00B9366VO|5.0|An incredible amount of legendary albums were created here. I can't believe it isn't more of a household name. Brilliant.
B006BAEQB2|5.0|What an amazing way to tell a story. The same story from three different points of view. At first I saw Elizabeth as the innocent party. I never thought there was a different point of view. Then I read Anne's story and truly felt what she was going through, and saw how she felt she was the wronged party. Gregory does a wonderful job filling in the blanks left by history to create a truly plausible history that is much more exciting than any soap opera. Next up The Red Queen.
B008Y1YK9Y|4.0|I added this to the other MIB that I have, but it is not as good of move as the others. But nice to have.
B00E8B1358|3.0|I didn't think it was as good as the first one, and had a hard time watching till the end. The Rock looked good, though :)
0812415086|5.0|I got this for my 88 year old mother and she loves it. She like to read it over and over again.
B00DC7NNAC|4.0|This movie was better than I thought it would be! I especially enjoyed the witches! Franco's constant grin was annoying at first but grew on me.
B004GJDQT8|5.0|I love this app. it is so great and I really love how my orders come super fast. earlier than I was told the shipment date was.
B00DGN51O8|4.0|I liked this movie, It was better than I expected. The visual effects were nice. I did not feel like I wasted my time.
B00DUGCLY4|5.0|this app is great!!! i love it. it makes you think a lot i think that everyone will love this app
B005CRQ4OW|5.0|This book  was funny. I loved this book. The pictures are really good and funny. I really loved this book!
B00DHKKN6Q|5.0|Really fun and challenging so it stays interesting. Would recommend for kids and adults alike.  Fun way to teach about angles.
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|There is no controversy to this book. It examines the historical reality of the Jesus story, examines the variety and commonality of radicals professing to be the messiah, and presents the politics of the early first century and how the interplay between the Roman Empire and the new religion's leadership in Jerusalem colored the interpretations of Jesus' life in the New Testament. It does not attack Christianity or its tenets; it is, as the author states on the first page, a study of Jesus, the person, not Jesus the Christ. A fascinating study by a religious historian and scholar who writes cleanly and clearly for us non-historians.
B00EYN3HTA|5.0|Peter, Enchantment and Stardust<br />By Author William O'Brien<br /><br />William O'Brien has written several fantasy books his latest being, Peter, A Darkened Fairytale. The story of wizards and demons and dragons has obviously inspired William beyond his love of prose to poetry every bit as good his excellent twisted fantasy tale.<br />I couldn't tell what style of rhythm he is using other than to say it was very good. Entertaining. Each poem is a short story unto itself and William did a great job with each and every one of the fifty plus poems.<br />The poems all relate to characters and scenes in the story, Peter, A Darkened Fairy Tale and although the poetry can easily stand by itself it the perfect companion to the story which inspired it. I whole heartedly recommend William's book of poetry, Peter, Enchantment and Stardust, it is a must have for those enthralled with fantasy tales. Five stars-- Everyone is a writer. We write the story of our lives through living it every day. What kind of story are you writing? -Author Cliff Roberts<br />-
B000I0XLYO|1.0|The only redeeming value of this movie is the mystery one must ponder at how so many talented people allowed their names to be attached to such an endeavor. The pitch made for funding must have been brilliantly deceptive. Worst movie ever...and that is saying something.
B007G5H2HQ|5.0|The people who make these animated movies are geniuses! Movies for the kids with plenty of adult humor - what more can you ask for?!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This was fun and challenging, I enjoyed figuring out each level.  Definitely recommend it to everyone.  I hate word minimums
B00BHNQ5XK|2.0|This movie was not scary. It was actually quite predictable, also it was a mix of the movie &#34;the woman in black&#34; and some other movie where the person eats children. I wouldn't recommend it if you're looking for something to get scared by.
B00DYCBH4O|5.0|This is one of my all time favorite books. I love the pictures as you going through reading and they give a little scene. This is definitely worth it.
B006M4F67A|5.0|I like to play at night while my melatonin kicks in. I can not seem to stay away.it is enjoyable and I can tell blocks apart easily.
B0036S4B6M|4.0|Great book! I loved the story and the characters were so vivid and entertaining. I'm sharing this with everyone I know.
B007GCY8FS|2.0|We have read every one of these...we will most likely stop here......sadly it seems as if Mr. Child has gone the way of others and it's just the same old song ...second, third, fourth verse......his ending appears to be dead line determined.....as in &#34;Oops, I was to have this turned in on Monday....quess I better wrap it up tonight.....&#34;......sorry......it was a good run while it lasted.....I appreciate all of the good ones ...but this isn't it......
B007PKDVOA|5.0|You can't top the harmonies on this album.  Not since early Yes and the Beach Boys have I heard harmonies to compare.<br />This album is hands down the best optimistic prog rock I've heard in over 30 years.
B005MLOKXA|5.0|This is a superb and riveting show. It is extremely well written and each episode really draws me in to see what new drama and suspense will unfold next. I find this show so interesting because it actually feels real & believable, and because the plot takes so many different turns that take you to so many unexpected (i.e., unpredictable) places. I first watched Season 4 - not ever paying much attention to show in the previous years - and was immediately hooked! I can't believe I never tune in before to see what the show was about. Now I am excited to be catching up on the previous seasons and the tons and tons of amazing episodes that I get to watch! :)
B00ABKGG0C|5.0|I would have given 4.5 stars because 5 out of 5 makes me nervous, but as that wasn't an option...<br />I wasn't expecting much when I started simply because I knew almost nothing about the book, but it quickly caught me not with some new idea or story, but the way in which a common story was told.  Along the lines of Gene Wolfe's Book of the New Sun series and Andrzej Sapkowski's first book of The Witcher, Last Wish, we have a child (for all intents and purposes) abandoned and left to become the ward of a strict sect, and follow him as he grows.  Ryan's prose has depth and variety; refraining from becoming stilted or (worse) repetitive.  I look forward to more from this author.
B009JZSC9S|4.0|Season 4 does a good job of continuing character development and advancing the storyline from previous seasons. Definitely a good watch.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|its a lot of fun and its easy enough to play plus its just cute the kids have fun and the adults too
0307276902|4.0|I really enjoyed this book not only for the good story, but also because it is set in my home state. There's controversy as to whether the story is true, but either way, I really enjoyed the book.
140006922X|5.0|I really loved this academic perspective of the life of Jesus. So fascinating and based in fact instead of religious bias.
B009MCRHH6|5.0|Not enough can be said about how fun this game is. Challenging, quirky, funny, addictive, easy to play, and great comic book like graphics. Superb quality and never any glitches. Quirky humor. Not enough games like this.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|.This game demands that you pay attention.  It is NOT easy and it keeps you looking for the next  clue. Very entertaining!
B005S9EK5Y|5.0|The book is easy to follow, considering its many characters. The &#34;American Opera&#34; has always been a favorite. Samuel Kritzberg
B003VANOFY|1.0|I purchased a G930 headset 2 months ago and have been having issues with it ever since.  It started out with the connection constantly dropping every 5 minutes and it still happens just not as often. But just now it has officially become unusable. I was playing BF3 while using the headset and suddenly I hear this faint buzzing sound coming from both speakers in the headset. The faint buzzing sound quickly became louder until it was so loud it was unbearable and I had to take the headset off. When turning down the volume didn't affect the buzzing even if I muted the volume. I tried turning the headset on and off and changing the USB 3.0 port  and that didn't work. Now after all of that the headset refuses to stay on. I turn it on and after about 3 seconds it shuts off. I tried to reset the receiver and that didn't help. I am very disappointed in logitech I had high hopes that this headset would be a great headset but it has unfortunately turned into a nightmare.<br /><br />Dont buy this headset unless you can deal with constant connection drops and possibly it just not turning on.
8866137480|4.0|The planner gets dirty easily, but other than that, I have not many complaints.  The pages are made from excellent quality and it is easy to carry around.  I would like it much better if it had a periodic table, but I can always print one and tape it in!
0553801473|5.0|The only problem I have with this book is that I want more! The style that the book is written is great, it's a great way to keep up with everyone and all of their individual adventures. Love it!
0763644765|5.0|Adorable words. Fun read for grandbaby and grown-ups! Mt grandson isn't old enough to start potty training,  but he likes the pictures.
B0049J3QNG|5.0|The theme of making a choice between your heart (stay with Andy), or your mind (live forever in a luxurious museum) makes this and excellent movie.  The introduction of Jessie is excellent.  The action, the hints toward Toy Story 3 (the monkeys at the end), the dual villains, all add up to a great Pixar movie.  My 4-year old son watches this constantly.
B00DH773IA|5.0|I bought this CD the day after seeing Sco's band play this set at the Old Town School in Chicago.  The concert was funky, soulful and featured very futuristic grooves in addition to his masterful guitar improvisation. (I imagine this is what music will sound like in the future - even though Sco's music sounds like this now!).  This CD is very representative of what the Uberjam band live experience is; great funk guitar, tasty soloing, solid old school soul bass playing, masterful drumming all mixed in with electronic textures.  But at its core the CD is ultimately about soul and groove music and pays homage to Al Green and Curtis Mayfield.  John Scofield honorably pays his respects to these artists here.  In addition, this is as accessible a Scofield record as you'll find out there (he is prolific) but this example does not trade accessibility for artistry. (Makes me wonder why he's never been a featured soloist on a Steely Dan CD.)  Very cool music. Buy the CD and then go see the band live - you'll appreciate Sco's music even more.
B00EY8BRGU|3.0|It had a styling similar to The Italian Job, but it just wasn't as good..... I'd give Now You See Me 3.5 stars
B0063IH60K|5.0|love to play. the game is well organized easy to use. some problems had to delete and then reload but was glad to do it hours of fun
030759565X|5.0|What a great book.  I am planning on using this book for many years to come.  It would be useful for anyone beginner to advanced cooks.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|it relay wander full, like it , am recommended , so i gave it 5 stars !!!!!!! great  upgrade to full vergen
B000FCKC4C|4.0|A delightful journey in a Far Away Land, easy read ful of wonderful metaphors that hold true in our everyday lives.
B00EY8BRGU|4.0|Great movie. I really enjoyed watching it. It kept me going all the way to the end of the movie.
0553801473|4.0|the pace is a little slower than i would have like....but a good read nonetheless. Can't wait for the next book!!!!!!!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I have never played this sort of game before, and it is quire interesting. As others have mentioned, it is not too difficult, but challenging enough to be fun. Just make certain to leave no stone, chair, plant, painting, or microwave unturned!
B005DNO7MQ|5.0|Great movie. I am shocked that it took me this long to finally watch it! &#34;What we do in this life, echoes in eternity&#34;
B004SIIBGU|4.0|ok but always double check on home computer because it seem you can not see all available items that are listed.
B003H4I4JU|5.0|This book was even better than the first!  It is a well written story and ties up a lot of loose ends left from Enders Game.
B00E8B1P9M|4.0|The rock has made a new career in action and I generally like the stuff he is in.  For a big bdget film this didn't actually seem like it was.  I mean you pretty much watch this movie if you want action and fight scenes.  Which it most definately delivers on and it is probably better for kids than adults who will want some story too it.  It is a super hero type movie but with regular elite soldiers.  It is GI Joe after all.
B003G4W49C|5.0|What a great book!  Mind blowing! Amazing, especially considering it was written in 1991! There is a surprising twist at the end.
B00AZMFO9U|5.0|A must see. Musicians of all ages will wish for a house like this one! Great performances by these fine actors.
B00BQ1D7X4|4.0|This picks up right where Black Gives Way To Blue left off. If you liked that album you will like this one to. I really love Voices , probably why they made it the second single. Not that Lane Staley will ever be forgotten , but rarely do bands have second acts this successful.
B008UCJ7KO|2.0|Basically one long sex scene, characters have no character. Plot practically non existing - tries to introduce crime element, not very sucessfully
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|Very easy, great time choices. Nice look &amp; does what is supposed to do. Simple and straight to the point, which is key on a lot of these apps.
B009NFHF0Q|4.0|I have always liked Neil Gaiman's works, and this book is no different.  It's a sweet story, and thoroughly enjoyable.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|Loved app . Need I say more? This app I was not sure of but someone recommended it and I loved loved LOVED it.
B000I09KZ8|5.0|Repurchased this to replace my original copy that was lost due to Hurricane Sandy.<br />Always was my favorite Eagles recording and still is.  Well worth the purchase.
B009XWD02G|1.0|Can I rate LESS than one star! I HATE this app all it does is fart over and over again! The people who made this app are stupid! They might as well call this app &quot; Don't Buy Me! &quot; DO NOT BUY!!!!!!!!!!
B004RCUJ9E|5.0|My kids love checkers.  I remember sitting with my grandfather and playing checkers and it's nice that I now have a board wherever I go for my children to play as well
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is fun. And I love to play it plus I love horses and its fun when I'm bored  woooohoooooooo fun game f f UN fun fun fun np
B00CF34B2I|2.0|I have over 2GB of space on my SD card and almost 300MB free on the internal memory....how much memory do you need to UPDATE?!?!?<br /><br />The currently installed version of the game itself was a nice trip down memory lane.  I'd like to keep playing and will certainly increase the star rating if I can get the update to install
B0007MAJBQ|5.0|Was glad to have found these on the interwebs and stocked up accordingly, one of my favorite formats is just about dead, and would be without blank media. Now would have preferred these to have been cheaper but oh well. This format although no longer supported by Sony is fun, you can find home players in good shape and fairly cheap. The portable recorder models are a little more scarce especially the more expensive models, cd quality or better sound and recordable. What's not to like?
B001CBA6P0|5.0|I use this fun for HDD docking station. I bought one of docking station before, but it getting hot when I use long time. I arranged and attached it docking unit  with cooling fan. Now, it is cool enough even I use it in long time. I love this quiet fan because all of my computer system is without noisy cooling fun or fun less. I use my system to use for hifi audio listening with iTunes since I have several thousand of CD. Now. This fan is best for my quiet system.
B00CNIDIBA|5.0|If you don't see a *phenomenal* improvement in PQ on first playing this version of the film, you might want to upgrade your BD player and/or monitor. I wish all of my (too) many blu-ray discs looked this good... And, in addition, it's *still* the best of the series.
1250030951|4.0|You don't have to have a twin sister to feel Cath's pain when, during their freshman year at the same college, her twin, Wren, makes it clear she wants a separate identity from Cath.  Wren wants a college experience of new friends, guys, parties, and maybe a little bit of school.  Parties and meeting new people make Cath anxious, so the sisters quickly go their separate ways.  Cath is hurt, but she accepts Wren's decision.  Wren settles easily into college life with her new friends, and the relationship between the two sisters becomes more distant and strained.  Cath has no interest in making new friends, and she refuses to interact unless absolutely necessary.<br /><br />Cath's creative outlet is writing fanfiction.  She's built a large and following of her work, and she is committed to her readers.  I've never had any interest in reading fanfiction, and I still don't, but Fangirl helped me to understand the culture and the passion for a particular work that drives people to write it.  In particular, I understood exactly why it was so meaningful to Cath.<br /><br />Many people will relate to Cath and/or Wren, and I'm no different.  For my freshman year of college, I went to school on the other side of the country, at a huge university where I knew no one, and I was desperately lonely.  Like Cath, I hid in my room, I avoided interacting with anyone, and I was suspicious of anyone who tried.  I transferred to a university back in my hometown for my sophomore year, joined a sorority, and then I turned into a Wren.  (Guess which experience of mine resulted in better grades?)<br /><br />Fangirl is filled with uniquely fascinating characters.  Even though I was less than halfway finished reading this book at the time, Cath's brusque, abrasive roommate, Reagan, made my list of Top Ten Secondary Characters.  I was worried someone would reply: \\"Wait a minute!  Reagan is an evil serial killer!\\"  I'm happy to say my instincts were right, because Reagan remained true, supportive, and funny..  Something in Cath cracked Reagan's tough shell, and she was determined to drag Cath out of her own shell, even if kicking and screaming were involved.

Cath is not without flaws, and stubbornness is one that tends to cause her problems.  As painful as Wren's rejection was (that's how Cath initially viewed it), without it, I don't think Cath would have had any relationships like the ones with Levi and Reagan.

B00DR0PDNE|3.0|I purchased one early on - but have not found the content I expected on Netflix or Hulu.  I was pleased (for a day) when a third party product allowed me to stream from own computer - alas, Google shut that off quickly.  Still waiting for additional providers - still not there.  With Amazon selling the product, I can only hope that they will allow their video content to be streamed to the Chromecast.
B002RVCD46|5.0|Great movie. Classic. Download so very convenient for my phone, laptop, computer. Anywhere I am, there it is ready to be watched. Great convenience.
B00DC7NNAC|4.0|We enjoyed the acting, the twist on the old story. Science fiction added to fantasy. The special effects were great, too. We throroughly enjoyed this series.
B009ZQC7MY|1.0|If it weren't for the lovable characters, this season would be an historically accurate portrayal of the shift to &#34;new ways&#34; and thought that has culminated (worldwide) a century later with unbridled perversion and lawlessness . But some things are wrong no matter how much time passes and in season three the writers rewarded good with evil and then rewarded evil thereby calling it &#34;good.&#34; The overall theme is that there are no taboo's anymore, love means acceptance of whatever &#34;feels&#34; good.
B0017QSZW6|5.0|The entire &#34;The Tudors&#34; series has been so good.<br />Once you start you won't be able to stop.  Very true to history.
B00ECU34ZM|3.0|entertaining enough but I probably wont rewatch it until i'm sick on the couch and it happens to be on tv
B007IXWL2C|5.0|THIS BOOK WAS INTENSE. IF YOUR LOOKING FOR SOMETHING TO SPICE UP YOUR LOVE LIFE AND KEEP THE SPARKS FLYING READ THESE BOOKS
B000WGWQG8|5.0|I hope this type of historical description is used more in our public schools.  It absolutely brings life to history I had read but did not remember.  After watching this series, I will never forget John Adams and his contributions to the life of our country.  Wonderfully done!
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|Best game I have played in a while great story line easy to play and extremely addictive just wish energy repleated it self
B004J4WLPU|2.0|I enjoyed the book as a breezy whodunit but the ending ruined the book for me.  It felt as if the writer was trying too hard to be clever.
B0013TXA5Y|2.0|This is only an OK read.  My low rating is mostly directed towards the content and plot of this novel: 1) It feels too similar to (nearly ripping off) the Harry Potter series; 2) It panders to the teen demographic in much the same way that the Twilight series does; 3) If you have any kind of common sense/maturity you will constantly be shaking your head and palm slapping your forehead at the main characters; 4) the plot development and supposed twists are excessively transparent; 5) the ending provides neither a resolution to stand on its own or a sufficiently big cliff-hanger to lead into the second book in the series.
B00C1BHQXK|4.0|This book was recommended . It's a good book. Good supplement to continue the journey in life. I also recommend it.
B00BH0VSM6|2.0|The Bat started out good. Detective Harry Hole (Hooley) flew from Norway to Australia to find the killer of a Norwegian girl. But as I got just a little deeper into the book, things happened that never, ever, ever would have happened in real life: several things. Ut i thought, well maybe the author will have a good explanation when he ties everything up in the end. But at the end of the book I was just so disappointed that I had read that far. This is my first 2 pointer. I know I don't have a lot of books that I have reviewed, but I have read a lot of books and it is very rare that I read a book that winds up disappointing me to this extent. I really can't say anything more without giving away spoiler after spoiler, but the book could have ended after only a few pages. Instead it kept going on and on in unbelievable, convoluted ways. I realize that maybe I should have waited and let things simmer down a little before writing this review, but then I thought, this is how I feel right after putting the book down and I want others to know that I don't understand how it was put on the market without someone saying to the author, &#34;You're going to have to change a lot of things because this is just not the way the world works. It will never be believed.&#34; And I'm really very mad that the author waited until the end of the book to have his protagonist do the stupidest of all the stupid things he did throughout the book. Nobody does that! Nobody would allow that to be done.
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|Awesome game, fun, great graphics, addicting, non stop action. Definitely would recommend  it to friends and family. Absolutely love it.
B0084AXZK0|5.0|I hate the title I picked for this article but I just can't find another way to describe this classic. I can't believe there hasn't been a big budget movie based on this book.

B0038RONCS|5.0|I loveJason Derulos music.  It is so awesome. I couldn't be happier than when I am listening to his music.
0143118706|5.0|This book came highly recommened to me from one of my friends. It is not a story just a history about marriage and Gilberts own war regarding the committment. I loved this book for the fresh take on marriage and the insight into the history a must read for anyone with reservations or having a hard time within their own personal life!
B002QCAXOS|1.0|This was soft porn...turned it off after 20 minutes.  Started off by looking promising...then it started looking like a skin flick...I couldn't continue watching.
B0060CV31C|5.0|Underrated but hysterical movie. I had the pleasure of introducing it to my wife, who'd never seen it, and I look forward to showing this to our kids some day.

B00005RG6B|5.0|I had this show on VHS, purchased as part of a set w/ a CD.  Just had to get it on DVD when I saw it on sale.
B00004Y6NK|5.0|A bit of variety.  Good keyboard work from Phillinganes and Bass work from Nathan East.  Eric solid as usual on guitar.  Definitely worth adding to your E.C. collection.

B00E0MCYPS|1.0|Too hard to control the car.No fun !<br />It doesn't turn corners like you try.Doesn't work like you want it too
B00000INKE|5.0|Great blues work.  Eric expanding his range, both on the guitar and with the voice.  Several great tracks.  Worth it.
B000002B35|3.0|I found the sound quality weak and lacking. Compared with other David Gilmour recordings I am not sure why it was recorded to the standard it was, as others were done to perfection which I found this lacking of that standard
B0064MGU98|5.0|Well written story line, definitely not boring. I dont usually watch amazon video since netflix has much more variety and is all inclusive in the $8 per month. This show is not on netflix and I am enjoying it.
B001BKG9RQ|5.0|Best David Gilmour recording I have ever heard even better to watch. Best to but it with a DVD if you can
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|Great read  highly recommend it  have to keep track of characters though but not an issue will check out more of her books
B000E6UK5K|4.0|It is hard to compare this with other works especially after the Live at Gadansk concert. It has many similar songs except it does not have the full orchestra feel behind it. That is not to say it is not a great sound it is better than the Pulse disk which I found the sound recording lacking and weak almost as if the mic was across the hall.
B00526ZKYS|4.0|This was a good book and I hate to say this but I would loose interest every so often. I don't know why but it was lacking for me. It started picking up in the middle so that kept me reading and now I have to see what happens with Lena. I hope the second novel can keep my attention. I fell in love with Lauren Oliver with before I fall and I just can't imagine that these books should be anything less than amazing so I'm keeping my fingers crossed.
159463176X|5.0|If you love Khaled Hosseini, you will not be disappointed in his latest book! It is a great story as his other novels were. I loved it.
B0097PW7H8|4.0|This App [Battery Doctor] has taught me how to save battery usage.<br />I've downloaded 3 before, it's the best battery App based on my own experience (Kindle Fire HD)
B00821PCJS|4.0|Got a free Prime subscription for upgraded shipping, but ended up using it to watch this show. Burnt through the first two seasons within a couple of weeks, really wish they had season 3 on prime. Very engaging, great show especially having been produced by TNT.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I purchased this series on a whim as I enjoy period movies and such. What I got was such a surprise. This series, from the very first episode, grabbed me and held me captive. The characters are real, some endearing, some menacing, and the situations/plot twists and turns, all very authentic. I recommend this entire series if you enjoy the early 1900s era. Each of the actors plays their role excellently, i commend them all! But, I especially fell in love with Maggie Smith's character, the Dowager, as played by Maggie Smith. Her performance is compelling and comedic throughout! I love the series and I'm so happy I bought it!
B00006CXSS|2.0|Parts of one of the disks stops play and requires a skip of several minutes..The video itself is great.  Having a minimum number of words to submit seems to be a bit much.
B000SEIK2S|4.0|I really enjoyed the story and it was a fast read. Anyone who enjoys sci-fi books will enjoy this one.

B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Thank you Amazon, for getting our Chromecast here without a scratch!! It works wonderfully!!! Will NEVER go to Best Buy again to buy ANY product - staff is dishonest and hoarding the Chromecasts when they arrive, either lying about the number in stock or limiting the number available to customers.<br />Google has truly outdone themselves - picture is beautiful and works from computer, tablet, and android phone (running Ice Cream Sandwich, not even Jelly Bean!!) I'll be ordering a second one shortly =)
B00C7JGDBW|5.0|Brilliant introduction to an American classic. I was delighted to see how the story began. The Wizard did not age well...
B00EY8BRGU|5.0|Very entertaining movie from beginning to end. Light fare, but a fun time.  The twists are very smart and not predictable.
B00CBRH4YU|1.0|This movie dragged and dragged and dragged.  The female lead was so needy that it's no wonder she drove everyone away from her.  Very sad and boring movie.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|For anyone who read 50 Shades and wants more, Crossfire is for you. Better written, with more of a story
B004FRX0MY|5.0|this app is great, lets me have access to all my music quick and easy! you should defenitely get it!
B0042TV4IW|5.0|I enjoy this series very much.  The quirky characters make me laugh and the story lines are interesting.  I will definitely watch the rest of the seasons.
B005544TRQ|5.0|Awesome show, totally hooked!  May be the best legal show I've never seen!  Funny and smart, with more serious themes.
B00AKOB7CG|3.0|it is nice, easy and I still do not  take the time to open it since I got it, or to exercise hahha
0060930349|5.0|This book came on time, I love how well it was packed, brand new. I use this for my college history class, very informative.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|If you like these type books you should enjoy this series. I found it to be very entertaining, better than the HBO series
B005D9MUWY|5.0|This keyboard is a whole lot better than the stock one that comes with the S4. I would definitely recommend switching.
1616550414|5.0|This book has everything you need to know about Zelda.  If you are a serious Zelda fan this book is for you. The quality is amazing, and it shows how all of the games link together.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|The Chromecast is easy to set up and use.<br /><br />Pros:<br /> - Easy<br /> - Handy<br /> - Very small foot print<br /><br />Cons:<br /> - The faster your home wifi the better<br /> - The faster your home internet the better<br /><br />That said, I will be buying 2 more when they come back in stock because It think they would be great for my in-laws who we've already set up with Nexus tablets and they have Verizon FIOS.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|After finishing all three books, I have started the series again.  Loved, loved, loved the characters ..beautiful love story. Amazing as each book gives depth to Christians true person.  Well done, Ms James.  Thank you.
B00BTYP6QE|5.0|Each game in the &quot;Cut the Rope&quot; series has something new and interesting to offer in game play. This version does that too and with it's own imaginative surprises!!<br /><br />The great thing about these games is that they are not too hard for the average game player; while still interesting enough for those more advanced. The perfect balance! They are challenging don't mis-understand me. You can figure out each level. Though some may take trial and error to figure them out. I speak from experience. You can play a level over again to improve your final score on that level as well.<br /><br />Try each &quot;Cut the Rope&quot; app if you get the chance.  These apps respond so perfectly too. You'll have fun with them!
B009NY43NY|2.0|I was a big fan of the Sookie Stackhouse series until I read this book. I wish I could turn back time and leave the happily ever after to my own imagination.<br /><br />For vampire lovers the ending is not one you will appreciate. Not as bad as the train wreck that TB turned into a couple seasons back, but not how I wanted to see the series end. Of course I have thought that Sookie was a nitwit for a while now, this just proved it beyond all doubt.
B00EB6F1TY|4.0|The Movie (4/5)<br /><br />Let me start by saying I love the concepts thrown into this movie.  The plot has a few flaws, but overall, it is the best Iron Man story out of all the Iron Man live action movies.  That said, it takes a page out of the Extremis comic story.  It is far from original.  It features a lot of old Iron Man elements we already saw in the Extremis motion comic (which is free on Amazon Prime Instant Video).  I honestly love the Extremis concept, but that is such a small portion of this movie's plot.  The story centers on Tony Stark's inner turmoil after the alien attack of the Marvel Avengers movie.<br /><br />The characters showed potential for some great backstory moments, but the writing simply did not offer much in terms of backstory, and characters simply did not get flushed out completely.  I think the Mandarin character could have been done in a way closer to the comic character.  I did not appreciate how Mandarin turned out.  Thankfully, the Extremis plot worked out fairly well.  The ending, however, left me wanting more, scratching my head about what happens next.  The writing was simply scattered and felt unfinished.<br /><br />Bonus Features (2/5)<br /><br />The bonus features are terrible for the price.  I would rather they give us the bonus features as separate videos.  Instead, they are formatted as part of the movie, which reminds me of why I don't like VHS tapes.  In this day and age, we should have better organization of features.  Menus have been around since DVD movies, and it is easier to make a menu system for the web, so I feel that they have no valid excuse to not give us properly formatted bonus features.  You could get the movie from Vudu instead and get the bonus features as separate videos.  I wish I did that instead of relying on Amazon Instant Video.<br /><br />The lack of organization aside, the bonus features were somewhat boring.  There was a making-of video that took up maybe 20-30 minutes right after the feature film, and there were bloopers for about 4-5 minutes at the very end of the video.  Between those features, there were some deleted scenes and a Captain America prequel short.  The short was actually pretty good, but it wasn't anything memorable.  The deleted scenes were deleted for a reason, but some of them made nice bloopers in my opinion.<br /><br />Overall, I think Amazon screwed up the formatting of the bonus features, and that is probably the biggest flaw with them.  However, I do not think the bonus features add enough to the movie to make it worth paying extra for.  Save money by buying the movie by itself if you have that option.ilm, and there were bloopers for about 4-5 minutes at the very end of the video.

B00ANKV5VK|5.0|I love my new purple crocs.  I have always been happy with crocs in the past.  And hope to get another pair soon.
B00AYB0TOW|4.0|Interesting variation of your usual post-apocalyptic theme. There is good action and the actors seem to blend in well together.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|Great story, excellent script, awesome cast.  I enjoyed it in the theater and loved it all over again at home.
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|Old fashioned with a new-age twist.  I enjoyed the great imagery and special effects. Great cast! Lots of excitement. Looking forward to the sequel... so long as it doesn't get botched like so many great movies with sequels do...
B00CF2UORK|5.0|Funny but not too sappy in a way that only British humor can deliver. It is interesting to watch my son figure out what is going on without the use of words.
B009VB97EY|3.0|With so many good looking and buff guys on the screen at one time, I forgot what the storyline was.  Oh, wait there is none?! Perfect!<br />:)
B00ESY77LO|2.0|The two stars is the average between the three my wife gave it and my one.  The movie has a Cliff's Note sensibility which made all the same mistakes as the awful Redford/Farrow remake (Don't worry if you don't immediately get that the green light is a metaphor for the transitory nature of the American Dream, we'll show it a dozen more times).  Maybe it looked better on the big screen but he party scenes seemed claustrophobic on my 42&#34; plasma.
B00CTT9646|1.0|Opened up the package and barely even touched the phaser before it fell apart. I'm very disappointed and am returning it ASAP.
B00DDXJRJG|5.0|Trouble hearing is going away thanks to this app that really does what it advertises. I tried the rest and now this really is the best. I am very picky about what I buy and this exceeded my expectations. Rest assured this volume controller really does what it advertises.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|We really have gotten into this series starting from the beginning since we missed it at the start of Season 1 and are catching up.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|This was my first book by Loans Moriarty and I loved it.  I couldn't put it down.<br /><br />I highly recommend.
B005MLOKXA|5.0|hooked on the theme of each show. Love the actors and how the shows move along without interruption. Can't wait for the next Season
1932100660|4.0|I am not through the whole thing, but I have enjoyed most of it so far. It goes into break downs of some foods, the medical aspects and so on. I am an avid reader of health and nutrition, and was surprised with some new information. It also confirmed my suspicions with the &#34;world&#34; views on food.  GREAT!!
B003TSEL7S|5.0|Awesomely awesomely awesomeness awesome book read or I will find you and fast all over tour ugly nasty face and set it on fire then take a big nasty dumpy loss all over your face.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|This game is very fun and runs pretty well. It is a great free app and I enjoy it very much. Very addicting.
B003G4W49C|5.0|I had read this book years and years ago and decided to reread. It was as good as the first time. Anything I could say about it has been said already, so I will address my reviews to my friends that may have not read it.<br /><br />Whether you like sci fi or not - give this book a chance. So well written. Fascinating plot. Characters so well written. To my friends - read it!!!
B000SGSU58|4.0|Good, solid Bosch.  But the books do tend to run together after a while.  I made the mistake of reading a relatively new one first, then went back to the begining of the series.  But he does spin a good yarn.
1442419814|4.0|Uglies is another book I avoided reading for a long, long time. Finally, at the insistence of many students, I decided I needed to be in the loop. It faded in popularity for a while, but lately, girls have been reading it in droves. I was pleasantly surprised at how much I enjoyed it. The characters are interesting, the action compelling and the theme wonderful. Even though it is very long, this is a good choice for reluctant girl readers. They will be able to identify with Tally's moral dilemma: betray her rebel friend, Shay, and she can have her \\"pretty surgery\\" that she has yearned for her whole life; protect Shay, and she will be an outcast forever. Tally decides she can save Shay. What follows is non-stop action in the style of a Mission Impossible movie. Tally discovers there is much more to the pretty surgery than just being beautiful and much more to the rebels than just being against everyone looking similarly beautiful. I had a student who had never read a book in her life finish Uglies in three days. That is the best recommendation there is for a YA novel.
B00B8R1NP0|5.0|Story takes place in Rockton, Illinois, which is the perfect setting for this epic suspenseful crime thriller. It's almost as if I was in the city and right there with Stephen Bjornson. Page after page I was engulfed by the author's diction and description. Time killer constantly left me guessing what the reason is for the killings.<br /><br />This is not your typical boring crime book. If you are looking for something out of the usual, this is worth the dollar. Massively intelligent build-up. Great read and highly recommended. Without a doubt, a great bargain.
B001KWTBVQ|5.0|I love this show . I have watched it at least fifty times lol . It reminds me of when I was little watching Cinderella .
B009D5VNLS|5.0|Great movie and easy access on amazon prime instant streaming. I can watch this movie several different ways and it is great
B005DD7H50|5.0|I  DO NOT watch a movie more than one time on purpose...but I have watched this movie at least five (5!) times.  One of my favorite movies EVER.!
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|The book breaks the seemingly complex art of manifesting into small, effortless baby steps. Prepare to be amazed by the results!
B00AZMFJYA|3.0|I wasn't too impressed by this one.  Not bad entertainment, but not great either.  The story was ok and the cgi predictable  You are not missing a lot if you skip this one.
B008Y7N7JW|3.0|The movie was an adaptation of an ok book. Not exactly a challenge, and barely worth having on in the background. The adaptation was fairly accurate, though.
1612185495|5.0|First, the writing is top-notch.  Ian Fleming's fine writing make the book a pleasure to read.  As with most books that are made into movies, the book has details that the movie lacked. I am enjoying all of the details and deeper character development that didn't make it into the movie.  It is also refreshing to read a novel with a straight-forward story instead of complicated plot twists and more characters than I can keep up with that some novels have.  I am looking forward to reading more of these.
B00EY8BRGU|5.0|If you like Ocean's 11, and the Prestige, you'll love this movie. Lots of fun, and I would recommend it to everyone.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|The first quarter of Wool captured my interest but the pace was a bit slow.  However, after that, the momentum built and never stopped.  I could not stop reading until I finished the book.  Wool has a terrific female character, which is all too rare in science fiction, and an intriguing plot.  I can't wait to read the next in the series.
B009MF5BXK|2.0|Way too violent.  Thought I would like the humorous interactions of the key actors, but the massive explosions were over the top.
0062502182|5.0|Love this story. The item shipped in good condition. Loved the story and how Coelho unfolded a tale of a young man and how he finds his destiny.
B0030ZOYHC|5.0|Overall, this is an excellent film. I couldn't have been happier with how it was portrayed to a modern audience. For those unfamiliar with the Evangelion series: it was a very popular anime created in the late 90's that undermined the mech-anime genre. The series has maintained a faithful audience after it's show's end. It focuses on pilot Shinji Ikari as he struggles with the responsibility of being a pilot as well as the psychological damning associated with his father. The original series is incredibly complex and occasionally outright perplexing, but seriously rewarding to watch. This &#34;rebuild,&#34; as the show's creator describes it, is a great way to test the waters. For newcomers to the show you will be given an altered version of the original storyline with updated graphics and a more linear story progression. While this may be upsetting for die-hard fans of the original, I found it refreshing to see the story take on a new perspective, and some of the changed (more clearly explained) material helped me better understand the original series.<br /><br />While I would recommend the original series as a superior story, you can't go wrong with the &#34;rebuild,&#34; especially when you consider the price of the original series is incredibly expensive due to its discontinued printing. The original series is great, but I am equally captivated by the changes done to the four movie interpretation. With the next two movies releasing in the following years, I am eagerly anticipating their release to see how Evangelion Rebuild concludes the quadrilogy.

B00004XPPK|5.0|Gilda is one of the all-time movies and Rita Hayworth is one of the all-time babes.  In the days before home videos, film buffs waited years at a time for Gilda to finally show up in the middle of the night on TV.  It is perhaps the role of Gilda, more than any other, that both defined and defines Hayworth as a Hollywood legend.  Gilda is the story of a couple of ex-lovers who cross paths in post-war Rio de Janeiro.  Gilda and Johnny, Johnny and Gilda.  Everyone knows these two SHOULD be together, WANT to be together, HAVE to be together..but them.  Some call the movie film noir.  If it's film noir, then it's not of the dark, gritty variety, but rather, it is of the glittering, lush and plush variety that maybe only ever happens once.  To say that Hayworth's &#34;Put the Blame on Mame&#34; number is a show-stopper would be an understatement. Millions of guys all over the world fell in love with the black-and-white image of Gilda throwing her wild mane of hair first down and then all the way back, just before beginning her infamous strip routine.  Plot spoiler: Johnny couldn't take anymore.
B00AQ71FLK|3.0|Pretty disappointing. It's not a bad game, but it isn't very exciting. Meh. Can't see myself playing this long. Very slow, even on a 9&quot; Kindle HD, which isn't a shabby device at all.

B00CATSONE|5.0|Anyone interested in development and entrepreneurship has to take interest in this book. It feels good to read about people who ranks knowledge higher than pure economic interests and passionately live their imagination (made me think of Steve Jobs, really).

0316228583|5.0|I enjoy novels that step beyond the 'politically accepted' and challenge us to think of our society on a deeper level.  Harry's story required us to face the issues of bullying, evil, and dishonesty and look at bravery both socially and emotionally.  \\"The Casual Vacancy\\" requires us to face our prejudices, our attitudes, and the social classes.  It is not different but very much 'the same style' which JK Rowling has used to address issues about which no one wants to talk.  Rowling is a clever writer with the gift of storytelling.  I will read anything she cares to write because she cares enough to write about it.

B008M87GJK|5.0|BBC News is only the second App that I have ever downloaded.  I was delighted with its presentation.  Amazon Kindle Fire has such good colour and is so clear that it makes the overall experience all the more pleasing, but BBC News has to be congratulated on what I think is an excellent format.  It's so easy to find your way around the articles of interest.  Well done!
B00CF34B2I|1.0|Takes much too much space on both the Droid Razr Maxx and the Kindle Fire.<br /><br />After downloading it, I had to delete it and clean up my systems to get my devices running well again.<br /><br />I would suggest that you don't waste your time. YMMV
1250030951|5.0|I have never read a single word of a Harry Potter book, I've never seen a single second of a Harry Potter movie (unless you're counting commercials), and I've also never read a single word of fanfiction. I also, and this is probably taboo to admit, didn't really like Eleanor and Park that much. I gave it four stars and I think it's a well done, interesting book, but I didn't connect with it on any type of emotional level. Fangirl though, against all odds, I connected with on pretty much every emotional level.<br /><br />From the time I first read the description for this one I was intrigued. And from the moment I started reading I was totally swept up in Cath's story. I liked Cath immediately. Most of the time really neurotic characters drive me crazy, but Cath who's definitely neurotic, didn't. There was something about Cath's personality or intentions or Rainbow Rowell's brilliant writing and story telling that just took me away and happily carried me along through 405 pages.<br /><br />When Cath starts her freshman year of college she's upset that her twin sister Wren, who she's always done everything with, doesn't want to room with her and is moving on from their mutual addiction to the Simon Snow series (think Harry Potter). Not going to lie, I pretty much though Wren was a huge rhymes-with-witch from the beginning. I understand wanting to remake yourself in this new college experience, but I can't imagine doing what Wren did to a twin sister who's like my other half.<br /><br />The minute she arrives at her room Cath meets Levi who she immediately assumes (incorrectly, Levi and Cath go on to have an amazing romance, but I'm not saying more about that because I don't want to spoil anything) is her roommate Reagan's boyfriend. Even though Levi is the smiliest, happiest person ever I still loved him. And Reagan, Cath's roommate, was phenomenal. She's a total hard ass on the outside, but I loved how she took Cath under her wing while still being totally disgusted by Cath's lameness.<br /><br />The whole arriving at college and having Reagan as a roommate is actually the only part of the book I have an issue with. I went to a pretty small liberal arts college, not a huge school like the University of Nebraska where Cath goes, but it seems like a complete impossibility to me that Cath as a freshman would be paired with Reagan who's a junior. Does that happen places? Also, is there no orientation? I feel like everyone I've ever known who goes off to college has an orientation over the summer or right before school starts. Maybe Cath just skips it? But that bothered me.<br /><br />Moving on, Cath is pretty much a hermit. She goes to class, she makes a few friends in every class, but she has zero social life and spends pretty much all her time in the dorm. It's extreme, but it totally made sense to me. I wished she would take Levi and Reagan up on their offers to go out or hang out with people from class, but that just wasn't Cath.<br /><br />The fact that I can say that something \\"just wasn't Cath\\" speaks to how great this book is. All of the characters from Cath to Wren to Levi to Reagan to Cath's douchey writing partner Nick to Cath's mentally unstable dad (there's a great subplot about her dad's struggles) felt so incredibly real. There's no doubt in my mind that people like these exist in the world and Rainbow Rowell made them so well rounded in the book that I feel like these exact people were real.<br /><br />Let's talk about the fanfiction aspect for a moment. I was definitely skeptical. It was super cool that Cath's stories got tens of thousands of hits, but when I first started reading the book this whole fanfiction thing, and even Simon Snow, seemed like minor parts of the book compared to Cath's story. There are short excerpts from the \\"books\\" and from Cath's fanfiction between chapters and I kind of quickly read through them at first. But the more I read the more I understood how fanfiction was just part of Cath. I thought it was fascinating how she felt so much pressure to live up to her fans expectations. There's one scene, I think in the middle of the book, where she meets a fan and I was just so happy for her. I also became really invested in how Cath was going to finish Simon and Baz's story and I was getting anxious towards the end!<br /><br />Bottom Line: I can't put into words how much I liked this book. It easily makes my list of all-time favorites and if it's not my favorite book of 2013 is top two; I cried for about fifteen minutes straight when I finished and I tear up when I think about how much I liked it. Rainbow Rowell is a brilliant story teller and the characters here just come alive. Read it the first chance you get.<br /><br />I received a digital review copy from the publisher via Netgalley.

B002LAM7PI|3.0|The movie version of Gaiman's book is so altered that it lacks its power and beauty. The emphasis, instead of being on the girl, is on the collaborative effort of a new character with Coraline and that yields an unpalatable and ridiculous result.

B00B2JSRAS|5.0|A must read for anyone who needs proof of how energy works and how we attract it. She gives easy experiments throughout the book that the reader can complete. This book explains how our thought patterns sabotage and attract everything that comes into existence. Pam Grout writes in easy to interpret language.

I have recommended the book to all of my friends and everyone just loved it.<br />The story sort of reminded me of the movie The Intouchables  but in the book there is a lot more development of the characters and the life they both led.  How or if he loved her ,I am not sure but certainly he helped her become a mature caring girl.  I cried at the end because I was so moved by the way she loved him. Everyone should read the book

B003TNW044|5.0|A sudden death, two weddings, a mixup of phone numbers, new haircuts for Chandler, Joey, and Monica, a new girlfriend for Ross...and that's just the tip of the iceberg as Friends continues into it's second season.  I'm reminded of when Pheobe is possessed by the spirit of an old woman halfway through who remarks \\"Now I've seen everything.\\"  Well, I wonder if she now knows how wrong she was.  Nevertheless, this season continued with excellence, giving new drama, new love interests, cats, a soap opera doctor role for Joey, along with a new roommate who's father was probably Norman Bates, Mupet-fur pillows, Tom Selleck as an eye doctor (should have made him a regular, not just \\"recurring\\"), and so much more.  Through all of it, Monica, Ross, Rachael, Joey, Phoebe, and Chandler prove they've got each other's backs and we love them more for it.  Of course, every fan's biggest question is answered as television's newest power couple (or maybe they're the first power couple) hits the screen.  So, get this season to expand your Friends collection and find out why Old Yeller is brought up during the season.

B000QCS8TW|5.0|i was very impressed with the fact that George R.R. Martin wrote this. I've never been in love with a series so much in my life. Ive been reading so much YA that im kinda sick of the same dystopian romance that now that I've found this i can finally say &#34;I am in love with a book&#34; again. Now i just need t Marathon the show because i have to make up for lost time!!!
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|Chromecast is nice as it provides the ease of using Youtube and netflix. However, rendering from a chrome tab is not good.<br />Also, the problem that disappointed me that even I got a mail for 3 months of Netflix (supposed to get a promotion code after 5 days of shipment), I haven't got the promotion code yet. Also, when I go to amazon, I don't see any button available to contact the seller or to report the issue.

B0036S4B6M|5.0|It is a very compelling memoir. Kerman's writing about her experiences in jail are well written and  both frightening and endearing. It gave me new insight into seeing  prisoners as people, with all the varied personalities and human needs as others who are not imprisoned. It also was provocative in making me think about drug laws,mandatory sentencing, rehabilitation, costs, need for reform, and my own activism own on behalf of prison reform. My  bookclub has chosen it for our next book to read!

1250030951|5.0|There are some authors who write in such a way that I'm mentally swept off my feet, in love from the first words. Rainbow Rowell officially joins this short list, now that I've loved both of her books that I've read. Her books speak to me in a way that very few do, to a degree it's a rare to find. Rowell's books make me feel a little bit less alone, a little bit more understand, and point out truths I've often thought or even discussed with friends but not seen in fiction. I can tell you right now that I will be sitting on Attachments (not literally) for as long as I can hold out, because then I know that there won't be ANY MORE Rowell for who knows how long. That's how much I love her writing.<br /><br />Fangirl took me about half a month to read, which, if you know how much I read, is sort of insane, especially for a book I love so much. However, I was determined to read this sooner, but my review schedule is not forgiving of dalliances with books not on the schedule, so I read a chapter here and a chapter there as I was able. This can be a bit of an onus for a book to bear, though, because it gives me time to forget everything, and can make connection emotionally more difficult since you're not as thoroughly immersed. With Fangirl, though, the moment I started reading, even if it had been days since I got to read any, I was immediately back in Cath's world. Within a paragraph or two, the world around me dissipated and I was completely absorbed and dialed in.<br /><br />Because this is such a highly anticipated title, a lot of bloggers have been getting early starts. Thus, though I avoid actual reviews until I've read the book, I've seen some tweets and statuses. Though Fangirl is nigh perfection for me, personally, I know other sorts of readers (as in those that do not have a brain that functions like mine) have had trouble relating to Cath. Certainly, Cath is a very different sort of heroine from the norm. She's introverted to the point of being almost a hermit, preferring to live her life almost entirely in a fictional world. Social anxiety plague her to the degree that she actively avoids making friends and refuses to go to the dining hall because she's afraid of embarrassing her self by doing something wrong. When things get heavy, Cath will just shut down and make really bad choices, like not turning in a final project because she couldn't figure out what to do. Cath is also angry, at her mom, at Wren, and at herself. I can definitely see where her decisions wouldn't register with more socially competent readers.<br /><br />While I am not precisely like Cath, I'm close enough that I get her. I could have been very much like her, minus the fan fiction stardom. See, in some ways, Cath's downfall was her happy high school experience: built-in best friend in her twin sister Wren, popularity that comes with hanging out with Wren, and comfortable boyfriend Abel. On arriving at the University of Nebraska for her freshman year of college, Wren's safe, familiar little world falls apart. Wren, who refused to room with Cath, wants little to nothing to do with her twin sister, desperate to forge her own identity. Abel dumps her for a girl who a) actually likes him in a romantic way and b) got a higher score on the ACT. Her grumpy roommate Reagan, with omnipresent boyfriend Levi, stress her out further. Wren parties for all she's worth to make new friends; Cath avoids people more than ever. With Cath's personality, suddenly losing your safety net in a new experience like this would result in such a response in a lot of cases. For me, I was so unhappy and friendless for most of high school that I started college fired with determination to become an extrovert; it didn't work, but it did get me through the first weeks.<br /><br />What Cath fears more than anything is being bad at something, and here is where I understand this girl so much it hurts. She resists new experiences because she doesn't want to make a fool out of herself. This is behind her trepidation to go eat in the dining hall, where she could go the wrong way in line or sit at the wrong table. This is also why she just doesn't do her final fiction writing project: she fears she doesn't have the talent to write her own world, and prefers the safety of her fan fiction. With romance, too, she goes very slow on the physical side of the relationship for fear of doing the wrong thing. With all of these, the more time that passes, the more difficult that goal becomes to accomplish.<br /><br />The romance is important, and I'll talk about that later, but I love that falling in love isn't the only thing to help bring her out of her shell. Forging a relationship with her roommate, Reagan, is her first true step out of her comfort zone. Sick of watching Cath subsist on protein bars, Reagan forces her to go to the dining hall, and this becomes a routine. There, they bond by people-watching other students, making up ridiculous stories about them. Though Reagan and Cath have little in common, they're able to find ways to connect, and, if Cath can handle the intimidating Reagan, that's a big step. Plus, bonding through stories and jokes like this is exactly what Cath does with her family; the way to get through Cath's heart is through fiction of one kind or another.<br /><br />Family issues are key here, too, though they are not tied up in a tidy little bow. Cath and Wren have a loving father, who's raised them as a single parent since their mom walked out when they were kids. Though their father, Art, takes good care of them, he has manic depression, and needs a lot of looking after himself, as he will not take his meds, since they interfere with his creativity, necessary to his job in advertising. Art always gave them pretty free rein, trusting them to be responsible and to keep him in check. The twins going to college changes the family dynamics, which is painful, but ultimately better for everyone. On top of that, their mother wants to talk to them, but Cath wants no part of the woman who abandoned her.<br /><br />Then there's the romance, and, my goodness is it swoony. I won't tell you who the guy is, because it's better to let things evolve in front of your eyes. However, I will say that Rowell gets the speed of emotions just right in Fangirl, both friendship and relationships. Once something starts, it moves with the speed of a man-eating hare. Relationships of all sorts build so quickly in college. Since you're with everyone from morning until night, there's so much more time for feelings to build, because you're all crammed together in dorms. As a kid, you lack transportation or have a curfew in the summer, and other times half your day is school. As an adult, most of your time is spent at work, so there's less time for socialization. College is friendship in romance in hyperdrive.<br /><br />The romance in Fangirl is a slow burn that comes almost out of nowhere oh so perfectly. Rowell hurt my heart a few times along the way, but she made it all work so well. In a lot of ways, this guy is not my ideal love interest, and I wouldn't want him for myself (several of his qualities are dealbreakers for me personally), but I love him SO HARD for Cath. Who knows if they'll last forever, but he's just what she needs right now.<br /><br />Much as my heart wants to give Fangirl every single star in the heavens, there was one thing I didn't completely love. While I did love the fan fiction angle, I also found one element puzzling. Cath is writing an immensely popular slash fan fiction about Simon Snow, a wizard, and his nemesis, Baz. The Simon Snow series is an obvious stand-in for Harry Potter, which I'm totally cool with. What threw me for a real loop was a casual reference to HP within Fangirl. Why would both exist? This really does not make sense to me. If HP exists in this world, why draw up an imitation to reference? I suspect it has something to do with the amount of fan fiction included and copyright,but why not just leave HP out entirely? In this world, Simon Snow probably wouldn't be that popular if Harry already existed, because it had been done. If Simon came first, then what sort of commentary is that on Rowling? Logic fail aside, I also was not nearly engaged in Cath's fan fiction, so I was generally just waiting for those bits to be over. I do really like the role it played and her life, and the discussions of fan fiction versus original fiction, but the story itself was of somewhat limited interest.<br /><br />I will read absolutely anything Rainbow Rowell writes. Though I've only read two of her books, she's near the top of my favorite authors list. Fangirl has realistic characters and is jam-packed with feels. Also, if you've been searching for books authentically about what it feels like to be in college, you want this book.

B00DDXJRJG|4.0|This is a nice small audio tool that anyone who has ever used an old component equilizer will easily feel comfortable with.
B007W8S2MG|5.0|My interest comes from Youtube Let's Player Superjeenus but that doesn't change the fact that this is a great game and is a must buy for anyone with a PS Vita in my opinion
B00EJOCB4G|5.0|My son and I have enjoyed building these, and combining them, then destroying them and creating our own worlds as you would in Legos or Minecraft.  Another welcome addition.
B00CTKHXFO|5.0|If you are a fan of Metal Gear & Metal Gear Solid then this is a perfect collection to get, it contains every MG - MGS game that has been released (of course some of them are downloads) and it's all on one console. Definitely recommend it!
B001P06GX4|5.0|Great game for the whole family. The longer you play the more difficult and interesting it is. Truly recommend to everybody who likes strategic games where you have to think.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|Great drama and great characters..I love watching the fashion on the female characters as well...<br />Can't wait for the new season to start..
B0073COMUW|2.0|most of the led bulbs that i've purchased is somewhat flat making it great for recessed lighting...this bulb, because of it's large dome, protrudes out of the recessed canister a bit, making it unsightly in my opinion.
B006GLMHBM|5.0|I have re-watched this series so many times and love starting to watch Sex and the City all over again..I wish it was still on the air..
0393976041|3.0|Don't really care for novels like this, but had to get it for a class I had to take. Thanks
B004X6PRO6|5.0|A very thought provoking book with wonderful characters!  This is not an easy read, but well worth the effort.  I' d recommend it to anyone who enjoys a challenge and is usually bored by an easy &#34;beach&#34; read.  Well deserving of the Pulitzer.
034580404X|3.0|This was a gift for a friend.  It was requested so I got it.  Thought it was a good price for the trilogy.
B005J3IEZQ|5.0|Truly informative, capturing all the facets of the personality of a great man who truly changed the world we live in. An 'insanely great' book.
B005544TRQ|5.0|Great series....good acting and writing....I like how the main characters personalities are developed and the clothes are great too ...really enjoyed watching the series
B008K9SG9K|1.0|This is probably the worst sounding CD I have ever owned, and I've got over 500 discs in my collection.  It's not that the songs are bad, but rather the production or mastering of this CD is purely awful.  Every single track sounds muffled and compressed, like a low-bitrate internet radio station.  It's horrible.  Painful to listen to, I've already donated it to the local Good Will store.  I just can't listen to it its so bad.  Do yourself a favor and do not buy.
B000PTYPAC|5.0|Paramore is cool, I listen their songs since 2008. The CD is cool & It's definitely rocks. Paramore is Awesome & They are cool. Rock Music is cool & it's definitely rocks. The CD is very good & The songs rock. Paramore is Parawesome & They are Paramazing. I like this CD & It's very good. I Buy this CD, Last Month. This CD is good & The Songs are Parawesome.
B00DJLLO0M|1.0|I purchase at least a few records a week and have done so for the last couple decades. I listen to a wide range of genres and have quite eclectic taste in music... I can listen to almost anything, so bare in mind it takes alot for me to say I dont like something. I knew this CD was coming out so excitedly I went and picked it up at the local record store on the release date. That night I donned my headphones and prepared myself for a nice relaxing musical experience. Much to my dismay this new Blackfield record was not soothing at all, it actually made me anxious because it is so awkward. I kept listening, hoping it would get better, but song after song there was more of the same terrible sounds recycled over and over throughout the whole record. Very disappointed in this release. I want my money back, what a waste! Stay away from this one.
B000QRIGLC|5.0|When you read this it's very hard to NOT believe it's a work of fiction, but KNOW it IS real and accurrate. What these SEALS went through and survived is unbelievable. Read this and feel your patriotism soar.
B00C1CO0XS|4.0|Enjoyed all but one track on this CD, Track one was really not needed and should have been left off.  I do not need to hear a child trying to sing Nat King Cole.  A little over done.
B00BCX2F66|5.0|I can put my phone in purse and not worry that can be scratched ...I am glad, I got this...recommend..
B00BXUG0KU|5.0|This is the first CD I have for this artist.  I have heard heard &#34;I've Thought About You&#34; several times on the radio and knew I had to hear more of her.  REally great!
B007SO31BQ|5.0|this is a dvd that every Formula1 fan should have. the story of a world champion and the war he had with Alain prost.
B007GCY8FS|5.0|I enjoy all of the Lee Child books starring Jack Reacher.  I intend to buy more and will continue to enjoy them.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Great but I think is should get things like ender man and wolves also<br />The jungle biome  caves would be best because I don't like to waste my pick axe. Also  caves are good for finding iron Butter diamond's. With ender man it should include the end and the Dragon.
B004GGQMTW|1.0|Dont remembeer the movie having this many F bombs, didn't even finish watching it! My friend & I took a Thelma & Lousie trip this summer with a better ending and looked forward to watching this when we got back
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Game is well done graphically. Love all the different things you can do around the barn. Great for anyone who is a horse lover.
044651506X|5.0|I guess I started the series backwards when I read a compatriots copy of &#34;The Panther&#34;. I have Nelson DeMille's whole series on the escapades of John Corey now and thoroughly enjoy my down-time reading DeMille's entertaining prose through Corey's egotistical wit.
B00DRPVE3M|5.0|Love this game...wish it would give more coins like other games but other than that excellent game...play all the time!
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I Iove this show, began watching the very first show on Halloween! Can't get enough!! Rick is hunky but I  Love Daryl the most!
1400082773|3.0|I highly doubt this book would be as popular or sell as much if Barack Obama weren't president.<br /><br />However, it did inspire me to write about my own life. About how my father left my mother and I when I was very young to pursue his dream of inventing cordless headphones/earphones. This caused me to live a more alternative lifestyle. One that included, parkouring, tagging up the urban decay in my city, street dancing, skateboards, drifting in hot cars, drinking Kickstart, etc.<br /><br />Coming soon I promise! I know the ending, it's the beginning and middle parts that I'm having trouble with.
B0035Q4AFC|5.0|We not only enjoyed the wonderful portrayal of Charlie Chaplin by Robert Downey Jr, but learned so much about the life and loves of Chaplin. He was one of the pioneers in film making and moved from the silent movies to the talkies.  We highly recommend this movie.
B00CNKPZYG|5.0|My wife has read all of the books as soon as they came out, she enjoys all of the movies and repeatedly watches them on cable. It made a great Birthday gift!
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|This book gave me a much clearer perspective on the politics of the time.  I enjoyed it very very much.
B008M721MS|3.0|I'd rather use Skype than any other face conversation or the pc or Mac. I love Skype,you should try it.
B00BBW15R8|5.0|A wonderful movie that will make you laugh, cry and stay glued to your seat for the whole movie. I have watched it twice and will do so again and again.
B00D7JGL36|5.0|Bought as a gift for a pal who plays the slide guitar and loves the Bakersfield Sound. He said it was great!
B005HEUEJQ|5.0|I Borg: Scene with Picard and Hugh: Wow! Patrick Stewart is amazing. I've seen this episode several times and this scene stands out in many ways. The way Picard turns on a dime and becomes Locutus. Then he doesn't let up. He keeps firing away at Hugh until Hugh resists and then decides to use \\"I\\". Oh yeah, there are lots of holes in the entire episode but this scene is amazing. Kudos to the writers and actors!
B006BFK5DK|3.0|I've been a fan of EWF since \\"That's the Way of the World,\\" the second album I purchased with my own money (earned via actual employment, not allowance; it was a rite of passage). I've purchased every EWF album since, some more than once (vinyl, cassette, CD, digital). And though I had every album when the group put out a boxed set, I bought the boxed set.<br /><br />So I say this with deep EWF history, and much regret -- this is among the bottom 2 EWF albums (just above Heritage, maybe, but I listened to Heritage again and ... OK, this is still better than Heritage).<br /><br />Album starts off well with Sign On, stutters with Love is Well, and picks up with My Promise. Guiding Lights and Got to Be Love are just so-so in the history of EWF ballads (certainly no Devotion, Touch or You Went Away -- look them up, I'll wait. See?) Dance Floor is a hollow disco tune, but Philip Bailey brings life to Night of My Life, and the album finishes well with the 70s groove of The Rush. But the What-Were-You-Thinking Police should have busted EWF when it recorded the meandering cool-jazz mistakes Belo Horizonte and Splashes, let alone put them on the album. Those are stains that will not go away.<br /><br />So why 3 stars? Because I would bleed if I had to give my favorite band of all time any fewer. It would be as if EWF was no better than, say, The Gap Band.<br /><br />For those new to EWF and are wondering how the group lasted 40 years based on this latest release, here are its best 5 albums (this is an objective list, so no arguing because it's fact -- \\"Best of\\" albums do not count because those are merely money grabs):<br /><br />Faces<br />I Am<br />That's the Way of the World<br />Millennium<br />Gratitude
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|I watched this movie with my daughters, 13 and 8 years-old.  They admired the bond between the sisters and their indomitable spirit to survive and protect each other.  Much love for girl power!
B00E8B1P9M|1.0|Putting Channing Tatum in the credits was kind of a cheat -- they kill him off in the first few minutes!  The action effects were pretty good.  But the movie was such a garbled pastiche of &#34;war&#34;, &#34;honor&#34;, &#34;Asian-stylized-fighting&#34;.  Maybe 13 year old boys would enjoy this...
B004GCPJDQ|5.0|If you have an apple mouse, you should own on of these. It is very nice not having to replace your batteries or just not focusing on your mouse charge all together
B005KR6NS6|5.0|As a lifelong ballroom dancer and fledging tango dancer...I loved this movie. So fun to stop frame the dance scenes and watch each individual step.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Fun app using math, puzzles, and being able to place items together is fun. Some levels are challenging and entertaining.
B008PPUMVY|5.0|If you have never heard this album before you are in for a wonderful surprise. If you live with your mom, turn it up so she can yell, &#34;turn that down!&#34;
B002T9H2LA|5.0|A Jewish girl named Shoshana escapes from the Jew hunter during WWII and seeks revenge. A band of Jewish American soldiers set out to scalp Nazis. Their stories become intermingled.
B00DGKVW9Y|5.0|the device itself has a strong build. the user interface needs refinement (feels like a pre-ipod product).  the sound:  OUTSTANDING.<br />Really--no exaggeration.  the player shines best with a headphone amp (i'm using the xp-7 by ray samuels ([...] with a pair of grado  rs1 headphones.  for the price and sound quality this product is truly wonderful.  there's are going to be improvements (a fiio x5 is planned for the end of 2013).  if you have the hi res audio files you will enjoy this fun player.
0060392584|3.0|As a fan of Marilyn Manson's music, I was hoping to read about a better person. It started out interesting. After a while, I started to realize that, at least when he wrote the book, the artist was very negative and conceited. He seems to look down on others and put himself on a pedestal.
B0081JPTCQ|1.0|This app is not a good note taking alternative to catch.find something else that works . That's all for now.
B002QE3CTY|4.0|Book started out good, got slow, the picked up again. Took me a while to read because the pace slowed down at times. Hope the second book is more action packed.
098555780X|5.0|Lenzen, is great, very easy to follow and VERY clear! I will be buying more of his books! He is the king!
B000NTPDSW|4.0|Great price for all three movies!  I was able to get the same set fThe color looks great in Blu-ray.  I was able to get
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|I loved it! It was so awesome!l am yearning for the next book!<br /><br />hope that October comes soon!But it is the middle of September. But I still rate it five stars!<br />Perrythistle
B00AREIAI8|5.0|fun for all ages...wish diamond became available more often.  I had to replace my device and could not log into old game...other than this I love playing
B005LBF7CY|5.0|I have always enjoyed Danielle Steel and this book was no disappointment.  It is one of those books that would make an excellent made for TV movie.
1401216676|5.0|This is an amazing comic. It has so much info on Joker's origin and the incident with Barbara Gordon. I recommend this to any DC comics fan, any comics fan, and even any reader who likes great storytelling, The art sets the feeling and emotion as well for this story. Great job to Alan Moore and Brian Bolland.
B00DC7N9NS|4.0|I was worried at first...did not choose HD version when I rented it and the picture was small and only about the size of our old TV (18&#34;) in the middle of our big screen TV. In fact, I was wondering if I could dump it altogether - I was that mad.<br /><br />Would much prefer an option that's fullscreen, in the beginning at least.<br /><br />It got better when he made it to Oz. wonderful imagination.
B000TGJ7ZY|1.0|My copy didn't come with the slip cover :/<br />I love this movie and all but I'm really rating the fact that Amazon didn't send me a copy with a slip cover. Very disappointed. And again, I love this movie.
B00B7PIRIE|3.0|This was a gift and I have heard that they liked it a lot.  I would buy more DVDs if I needed them.
B0030ZOYHC|4.0|OK. So how do I go about getting the special case with the artbook? I got the standard version :l<br />I would've pay more money to get the special casing. My copy is well and all but I'm just little disappointed I didn't get the very. I wanted.
B000NGTJTY|4.0|love the cast, all played great roles, for this twisted story of bad guy vs good guy. You never know when the story will twist
B005GY0Y8S|5.0|This story is written so carefully that the murderer is not known until the very last and is the least likely through out the read.
B004GYY714|5.0|I typically use this app, and another free music app to listen to hockey and football games that I can't watch on TV because I'm too poor to pay for the big sports networks. When I can't find the game I want with one app, the other usually has it, so I recommend more than one radio app if you use it the same way as I do. I find TuneIn easy to use. I can find stations all over the country that play the kind of music that I'm interested in, instead of listening to these crappy local radio stations that I'm stuck with on the airwaves.
B00CUKTGW6|5.0|This Clash box set is well worth the money. The sleeves that each album comes in are replicas of the original vinyl and they look great, plus the box that the discs come in is sturdy and has a pretty sweet design. The sound quality is INCREDIBLE. The sound quality is actually so good that at times it makes you feel like you are hearing the songs for the first time again. I'd say that this is essential for any Clash fan who doesn't have the money to buy Sound System.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|Have really enjoyed this app. Very informative and accurate. I use the weather channel app on my Kindle Fire and my IPhone. Works great with both Apple and Android system.
0545310598|5.0|You definitely need to read the series in order. You will not know what is going on unless you read the first book first.
B008RJ6TTC|5.0|I'M glad the DVD's are available. Columbo lives on. I get more out of the show by being able to watch it er.er and ovov
B004RJMUJO|1.0|I can't get even on the game!! HORRIBLE!! RIP OFF!!!! If you really want this game after you read this............I ask you WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU!!!!!!????? I would give it 0 stars but you can't.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Great read. Love Christian and Ana! Their relationship is so crazy but so sweet at the same time. Found myself smiling throughout the book!
B00E3BK0QQ|4.0|Finally g5 produce a new game for KINDLE FIRE...graphics is excellent..storyline is okay..but as usual game is way too expensive..4.99..No way I am paying that for a hidden object game..they suck you in to play the game for free then when you get into the game you want to pay for the game and when you do then you only play for extra five minutes or so...these developers are to be a shame of themselves
B00992CF6W|5.0|For 7 dollars, some people might think thats a bit much.  But i think its worth every cent.  It runs smoothly, great graphics, and its really addicting.  And I'll tell you one thing, im a girl who HATES those boy games, and i thought this was one, so if youre one of those girls as well, i wouldnt turn this game down.
B003YL4LYI|4.0|George really knows what he's doing. The fifth book is just as good as the previous four. Many new characters and story lines.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|For the price, you get more than you pay for.  Simple to use, easy to understand, and you get Netflix or HBOGO on your TV.
B009KS4XRO|4.0|I really like bingo blitz .However it takes 23hours before you can play again,then you only get 17bingo chips.which is so not cool .I would love to gat @least 20chips without the 23 hour wait.
B00CSYRHG6|5.0|This movie was fun and entertaining without the usual violence or typical evil villain.  It was fun to look for/hear the famous American voice actors such as Jamie Lee Curtis and Ron Howard. We bought the blu-ray DVD combo pack with extra features.  The extra features included press interviews on the film.  The movie was beautiful artistically.  It had a good storyline and good character development which made us really care about the drama the characters were going through.  Nice ending too.
B00ARF93AQ|5.0|It has a new spin on a old favorite.  I think its a good movie with good graphics has more
B0002KQNUO|5.0|If you like music that is strange and unique this is for you! I watched the show and my favorite songs are Vai vedrai, the woman's voice is so haunting and Icare, this was when the men did the trapeze act so the music helped enhance the mystery and enchantment. The CD as a whole is enjoyable as well!
B00CRWJ5GO|1.0|well he picked it and it was way to long. I stuck it out till the end. It was to long and drawn out. Some may like it. I will pass if offered again. Love the actors just could not stay awake for it. Too long.
B0016YBFZ8|5.0|I cannot say enough good things about this film.I watch it every chance I get. The acting is genius! Ciao!
B004ZGI2KK|3.0|It was a last min rental and it worked. Would I buy it no. But it was ok. Not bad but the great.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Keeps you intrigued all the way through the book.  One of the only books that has managed to make me cry!!
B00BOUL9DM|5.0|I love this game. It challenges you to think of things in different contexts than you usually would. Amazing find! Even better that it was a free app.
B004JNB4UO|5.0|it was a good movie i think you made a mistake it shows i paid for 2 but got 1
B00280LYIM|5.0|Once I read I can't stop. This is the best book ever written. I love the awesome chapter names the characters are awesome and the plot is EPIC. I recommend this if you like action and adventure. READ IT!
B004LQEYAG|4.0|watched it years ago just as good trying to find more outlaws of the west but there were no skips no pauses and no jumps
B009ANP48G|5.0|Very good movie is fun and different . He bought at an excellent price. I loved to see it purchased recommend it to everyone.
B002Q7JYPC|5.0|One of the best they made comes very close to the album Hell Freezes over, keep the group together, when are they going to be in the N.E. NY.NJ. PA???
B00826B65M|5.0|I love the writings of Honore de Balzac and it is great to have all of them reunited in a Kindle, so light and always available.  So far I have only read one novel and I found the book perfect.
B00ADW4I9O|5.0|This met all my expectations.  The added music is beautiful.  I'll look for more of these CDs, especially expanded versions
B004SDSSFY|5.0|Very helpful for homeworks. I can look and fix my power point and write on notes or lecture notes. Easy access
B0023SDPS6|5.0|So special to read the book after seeing the TV show.  The author has a wonderful sense of humor!  I am going to read all of his books. He brings WY to life, and being from CO that says a lot!
B0002T2Z1Q|5.0|We purchased this for a unique Sister's Trip in 2012... we love the story line of the movie. We are always saying we are going on a Thelma and Louise Trip w/out murdering, drinking, and most of all driving off the cliff:) The Sister's Four
B00004ZELJ|5.0|It's great re-watching them in one of their earliest concerts.  The DVD more than met my expectations.  Would definitely recommend people to buy it.
B0000DJZA5|3.0|NAKED, bad name for this version Let It Be album. I bought the vinyl copy.  But I prefer the original Let It Be from 1970 with the Spector sound. I prefer it to Naked. The 1970 record sound amost live, this sounds like a studio recording with everything perfect. There were only four songs with orchestrations on the 1970 album. I've Got A Feeling on the 1970 album has more powerful in it. Pauls vocal are so strong, The guitars are louder as a live song would sound.  There's fantastic lead guitar work by George Harrison on Let It Be in the middle and at the end. That makes it a better version than the single release. I Dig A Pony with it's false start and the little bit of talking add to the album as a whole. The start of Get Back with McCartney starting it and Lennon thanking everyone at the end. The Naked album has a version of 'Don't Let Me Down'on it. Dig It and Maggie May are removed.  The story told was McCartney didn't like the Spector sound adding strings to 'The Long And Winding Road but when McCartney plays the song in concerts he has the strings sounds in his stage version. They are both worth owning.  I have both albums, but Let It Be 1970 is the one I play first.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|A friend introduced me to this addictive game. She was right once you start playing it becomes a challenge to achieve stars on every level!
B00AREIAI8|4.0|My preschooler loves this game. I find myself playing it too. The pop up ads are kind of annoying though and it seems challenging to earn new horses.
B00B7Y0206|5.0|There is no errors,it has all the videos and after the last kindle update this app IS THE ONLY WAY TO YOUTUBE.there is nothing wrong with this app.
B000GCFD72|4.0|This book offers great views and interesting ways to show your child you love them. Highly recommended!!! I really enjoyed it!
B0063IH60K|5.0|This is so fun to play. I carry my Kindle with me and whenever I have a couple of minutes I play a game. Easy to get addicted!
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|I really like this, not too complicated and keeps me out of trouble. Not keen on the limitations due to energy run outs but ce la vie!!
B005PK1G76|4.0|I have a city select and it works well.  I didn't want a humongous console, but wanted somewhere to put a few things and hold a drink.  Sometimes I need to adjust it because of the kind of handle my stroller has, but small price to pay.  It works great, is compact, and was inexpensive.
159463176X|3.0|I have to start out by saying I absolutely loved Khaled Hoseini's first 2 novels. He is a gifted writer who can make you FEEL so much. If I had not read the first 2 novels of his, I think I would really like \\"And The Mountains Echoed\\" because it really is a decent book. But, unfortunately having read the other 2, this book does not measure up...not even close. It was tiring to read. there are so many unnecessary characters. As soon as I would get into the groove of things, he would introduce someone else in a completely different setting. It was like reading 10 different books at the same time...without the satisfaction. At times I have to say it was a drag (this was never the case with his other writings). I am affraid with so many characters in one book, the writer is not able to develope them fully, even a writer as brilliant as Hosseini. I never felt a total connection with any of the characters and when I wouold start to, I had to learn all the details of yet another character that I did not care about. I kept thinking it will all come together. And it did to some degree. But even after I read the last page, I had no idea why Hosseini felt the need to introduce Markos, the drug lord, the drug lord's son, the nurse...I can go on and on.<br />Also, the first two books had numerous awe inspiring insights of Hosseini's view on life and human behavior. There was not a page in those books that didn't make me think \\"This guys is a genius\\". Unfortunately those moments in this book were few and far in between.
B004EFYZ1C|5.0|Love it, just hit a button and see what phase the moon is in.  Being a photographer it comes in handy.
B00AS1Q8FW|4.0|I have read all the Reacher series, and as a fan, have a difficult time with Cruise in the part of Reacher.  He just isn't big and bad enough.  He does a reasonably decent job with it though and most who are not as familiar with the books as I seem to not have any problem at all with him.  He definitely captures the mentality if not the physicality.  If you are looking for a decent action film, this one is entertaining enough to hold your attention.  I give it four of five stars.
B00DR0PDNE|2.0|Got the product today, but greatly disappointed with the results. Great idea from Google, but poor execution. Slows down the refresh rate from youtube. Picture is jerky and freezes often. I had great expectations from the product after the reading raving reviews. this is a Beta product and not suitable for commercial product. A lot more work needs to be done to make this somewhat workable.
B0089LOG02|5.0|Great read - Will recommend to my friends - A part of history I did not know much about - looking forward to reading other books about this subject
B007VTUYWW|5.0|If you like Angelina you'll like Lara Croft, both movies in the series are worth wild watching. My daughter watched this movie over five times.
B0008ENICU|5.0|I absolutely love this movie!  I watch it with my mother and we just laugh and laugh.  Each time we watch it we find something new in the settings or the back and forth banter between the women.
B007SSEZNA|3.0|As much as I tried to stay awake, I slept through most of it. My sister-in-law said she enjoyed it though.
B003NFM3JK|5.0|Loved the movie it is now a Christmas tradition to watch the movie before Christmas it makes my holiday more joyful and The price of this on the shipping came very quickly and I was pleased altogether
B00B2V66VS|4.0|this game is very good but sometimes it annoys me. but I do reccomend this game for anyone who likes a challenge.
0439023521|5.0|I can't wait to read the next 2 in the series!  Guilty pleasure, but very entertaining.  No complaints.  I really enjoyed this book.
B005J9ZFQG|5.0|Like the first Evil Dead movie. This movie is fun to watch. Not terrifyingly scary, but definitely interesting.  A nice continuation of the first movie.
0316056898|4.0|Exactly what you might expect from Tina Fey!  This book was so fun to read and I love how easy I could relate.
B005BRS8Z6|5.0|What great book! If you are tired of the status quo, this is the book for you. It tackles the belief systems we have established by asking us to really consider what it is we're subjecting ourselves to. If you understand where the author is coming from and where he wants us to go-and you will- then your life will change for the better.
B00ESY7QXI|4.0|Not what I expected but it was a good movie.  Leonardo played his part well and was a good love story
B0047WJ12K|2.0|plot is disjointed, sometimes don't know what is going on . this could be a good story if we knew what is going on.
B00CXVX1OQ|5.0|Monkey Boxing is a pretty cool app for your android. It's my first sports or action game after trying out the strategy and precision games involving jewels, blocks, and chimpanzees, and what can I say but \\"nice job?\\" As a longtime avid reader who originally purchased a tablet to replace my broken e-reader device, I'm really happy to experience all the cool things out there for my tab. One of the opportunities I find to use my device is while waiting at appointments and such, so I've come up with a system. As I wait before a scheduled meeting, I have no problem reading, emailing, catching up with news and scores, or playing nice, peaceful little games. However, if and when the time has come and gone to begin the business at hand, yet it's not underway, I pity the primate that has to face my swift and powerful monkey in the meantime. Enjoy! :)
B009GEEMLY|3.0|ok but not great just too many sub plots between characters. didn't follow any storyline from the comic book blah.
B00ECUARO8|5.0|An excellent thriller! Matthew McConaughey delivers on every scene that he is in. I strongly recommend it. Would not be surprised if he gets a nomination for an Academy Award (and wins).
B004EIZCPM|5.0|I love this movie to begin with, but also that I can stream it on my laptop or xbox. Wish I could watch it off my phone but we will get there soon.
B0063M22QO|5.0|I love this game.  Easy to use and fun to play.  Could I suggest to change the tile colors...just to make it more interesting!!!
B009NH6AOQ|5.0|got it for a birthday and they love the show as do i. its a great buy and would recommend it very much
B009LMTDL0|5.0|Sheryl offers an honest and insightful view into the issues women face today concerning work.  While I was reading I could relate to a lot of the feelings and situations she discussed.  If you ever feel like you are unsure about where to go in your career especially when you have kids you should read this book. It offers great advice and points to consider.  I also like the discussion questions and other reading suggestions at the end.
B0000AM6IY|5.0|It's cool to have a copy of one of your favorite movies and be abel to watch it, in full or in part, whenever you feel like
B0030DBGXY|5.0|LOL, Buy 2... ;)<br />This knife is rock solid.<br />Sharp out of the box..!!! Very light weight, lighter than expected, but not disappointing by any means.<br />This one is a beater..!!!, and will take any punishment you can throw at it.<br />Down side, dose not have a glass breaker.<br />Very much Love this Knife..!!

Stay away...!!! From SOG.... What a Rip... (SOG-Made in twain)..
B002NF1ZI6|1.0|What a disappointment. This toy was sold at at a national toy store... you know... the one with the giraffe. It was $11.99 there.<br /><br />I hop online to amazon assuming I'll get a good deal. Nope. Uh... Talk about a bad price. Hopping on down to the local lego store when I'm in the area. It's $12.99 there.
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|I hate having to decide what to try and flush from my device on a regular basis. Or the search for the app to help me do it better &amp; faster than I can manually. Sound like you?<br />Install Clean Master &amp; never be a slave to endless cache cleaning. 2 minutes, two or three times a week for heavy users (more than four hours a day) of Kindle Fire 1stGen Tablet. Six taps to clean caches system wide, temp files &amp; folders, history onboard browser and more.<br />Create a burst-clean function, for each time you wake device.<br /><br />GREAT APP Highly Rec'd A+++
B0089LOG02|4.0|I love  the story and the different characters.  I would  have liked for the story not to end.  I suppose that's the sign of a good book.  Maybe more
B000HZGNEU|5.0|I love this movie. It is the best of the series. It is funny and serious at the same time.
B006Y5EDRG|5.0|As a musical theater lover and past performer (college), it's great to see a show from a performance perspective. I love the representations and Katherine McPhee is phenomenal.
B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|I have don't really have gaming experience to offer for this mouse but overall, I do like it a lot. In general, it's very comfortable to use, the buttons are well placed and easy to access. I particularly like the ability to customize the buttons and the relative ease to set different profiles. I like to use with all the optional weights in and the laser tracking is very smooth. I have no complaints about this product in my 2 month of use so far. I think it's definitely worth the price.
0062502182|2.0|All \\"worldly\\" claims are unsubstantiated and without any tinge of critical analysis.  The book is written at a junior high level.  The characters are tossed in and out of the novel without any character development, making the story progress at a much too rapid rate.  The story line relies on all too basic concepts like fate and \\"Personal legend\\" to back up the already meaningless philosophy. The Alchemist is a feel good story with no substance or rationality.
B00E3BK0QQ|4.0|Good game but way too expensive!  come on G5......Really $4.99.......  What makes this game worth so much?  Let me know.
B0094BB4TW|4.0|I just like the app in general.  Use it all the time.  Sometimes easier than accessing on the computer, yeh!!!
B003Z49LYO|5.0|I guess that we all like the happy endings, but you know good drama.  Well you will not get one here.  This show is about the tragic life of a lower class woman with exceptional fortitude.  She makes things happen for herself partially through her good looks but mostly throgh her strong will.  Life just keeps on throwing stuff at her until she finally strikes out, unfortunately to her demise.  I guess I was hoping to she her succeed in the end.  It is a well made film and worth watching.
B0013TXA5Y|3.0|Not a book genre I typically read. Thought I'd try it since the movie is coming out. I really just couldn't get into it or the characters. It was well written and imaginative, just not my cup of tea.
B009OYSFDM|5.0|Really sets up Season 2 for this fall. Will really miss Tommy and will change the dynamic of  the show.
B0034IZVV8|5.0|Outstanding artists with great talent<br />Songs are very enjoyable to listen to and sing to. These guys really have it all
B005UG542S|5.0|This was worth the wait. I'm glad I finally saw it. I do not know why I waited this long.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Love it love it love it. I am very addicted. It's really helped me to plan vacations with friends who live far away and also to help keep track of wedding ideas. I have found so many great recipes and ideas for making things out of recycled materials.
B005BRS8Z6|5.0|I will be purchasing this book for several of my friends. Very interesting book and would be a great gift item for friends and family
B00EMJD6TC|4.0|I am happy to see big budget movies like this being made with big stars in it! keep up the good work and make more of them, note for the second one focus a little more on the gore!
1885167776|5.0|I bought this book a couple of months ago and I finally decided to read it. I should have it read it as soon as I bought it. This book will motivate you to focus on what you really want.
B00ESY7QXI|1.0|Maybe I was just tired (i watched while taking a red eye) but I did not like this movie, didn't even finish it. I was confused the minute it started. I'm also bored with Dicaprio playing eccentric rich hermits. It was big, grand and colorful as only Baz can do, but other than that, meh...
B006LSZECO|1.0|Terrible story.<br />I kept telling myself it would get better.  I was so wrong.<br /><br />I wish I could get a refund!
B009G78EE2|5.0|I an older, and not a huge fan of rap, but I LOVE Macklemore!!!!!!!  The CD is hot, the songs are catchy, hell I want to go to the Thrift Store.  Same Love is a beautiful song, and should be nominated for Song of the Year at the next Grammies.  .
0307352153|5.0|Wonderfully researched and presented.  This work is an important contribution to move our society forward and to assist in personal healing.  A gem!
B004YRSBTW|4.0|Memento is a dark movie and is hard to follow due the way the plot unfolds frontwards and backwards. I recommend watching several  times to gain insights into the characters and plot.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|It keeps your mind going. It make the day go by fast when there is nothing to do. I will keep playing
B0067R0APK|4.0|Great App! accurate and easy too use. It only has one flaw, when you set other places as your local weather. The app doesn't allow you to use a default location.
B00D7JGL36|5.0|It figures that Vince Gill would have the balls to cover the original Bakersfield sound. He and Paul Franklin do it as it should be done. I bought this CD in preparation for his Bakersfield show. Vince was my favorite artist to begin with and now he has moved up another notch on my list for his recognition of this music.
034580404X|5.0|It's basically a romance novel with many sex scenes. the 1st book is exciting, the second has too much sex, you almost get tired of the sex scenes. It doesn't seem normal that a couple can have sex that many times a day and have an orgasm every time and at the same time! The 3rd book gets back to suspense and romance.
0307749606|5.0|Its really great to listen to these books i sometimes forget where im going lost deep inside the adventure i dont want to turn them off
B006BFK5DK|5.0|EWF is the all out best band in the world. That signature sound is definitely heard in these tracks, Congrats guys, you are back.
0307750922|5.0|i really enjoy the way lee childs suprises uyou with the unexpected time and time again the jack reacher novels are great i will keep buying them as long as he keeps wrighting them
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love pintrest ! So many great ideas so many great recipes so many things I thought &#34;why didn't I think if that&#34;.
B00DSTBMMU|5.0|You know how, for many artists, their first album is the best? They have ideas they've been developing for years, and they put them all into that first album. I wouldn't say Sheryl Crow's first album is her best; her second and third probably tie for that honor. But \\"Feels Like Home\\" has something of that first-album excitement. It sounds like she's exploring ideas she's had for decades. It feels like she's been holding it inside her entire life.<br /><br />It's real country in the Miranda Lambert vein. She masters the vocal trademarks of country music effortlessly (at least it SOUNDS effortless). The stereotypical country themes country fans like myself love are there: drinkin', drivin', lost love, sainted mothers, (lack of) money, the simple things, and so on.<br /><br />My favorite album so far this year, at least up to now, was the Court Yard Hounds latest. This is easily as good. Every song is great.<br /><br />I've been a Sheryl Crow fan since the beginning. Her last couple albums have left me a little disappointed, in spite of their highpoints. This is as good as anything she's done. If she can convince the country market that she's not an interloper, she'll have a hit--which is great news IMO. I'd like to hear many more albums like this from her.
B00COHAUD4|5.0|Love Guillermo Del Toronto movies... Definitely creepy.  But had a good story..... Loved the creatures and characters in it! Enjoy
B00EY8A6BC|5.0|It was a tight, creative story.  There were strong performances by all.  Would have like to have seen more of the story between the 4 horsemen, but this wasn't the focus of the movie.  Woody was great, though.  I'd highly recommend this movie.  It keeps you guessing, and like any great magic trick... you never see it coming.
B009LMTDL0|5.0|Great book to remind everyone our work is far from over in seeking equality. Easy read with a lot to gain from her very powerful words.
B000ID1J0E|5.0|What a way to be introduced to Las Vegas: A convertible red Caddy at speed on a two lane road being attacked by bats!<br /> From the opening scene it was off to an amazing journey with Johnny Depp and his Lawyer through a surrealistic view of - what? Las Vegas? The drug culture? America? Police conventions?<br />There's a little for everyone in this over the top comedy and social commentary.<br />Highly recommended - just bring your sense of humor...
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|I give this book a five star rating because of these reasons:<br /><br />1. It is hilarious.<br /><br />2. It made me want to keep on reading and reading and reading.<br /><br />3. It has a great way to show the different points of view of the characters.<br /><br />By reading this book I kind of feel like I am in the book. Like I could be one of the characters. I character that is noticing every thing that happens in detail. I just really enjoyed this book and hope that others will love it to.
B005M0R524|5.0|I love the series as millions do but this set does not include the &#34;Christmas Special&#34; which is really the end of season 2 or the beginning of season 3? So, when I started watching season 3, there were lots holes in the plot and things that had happened which I couldn’t figure out until a friend told me about the &#34;Christmas Special&#34;.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|This story is about a  young woman that ends up being a companion for a quadriplegic man who is depressed and angry.  After a shaky start, the two find that they have a lot to offer each other and actually quite like each other.<br /><br />Without giving away too much of the plot I will say that this is a book about the quality of life and what limitations are too much to go on.<br /><br />Great book, and you will cry.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|This is an amazing book with such great writing.  The story is heartbreaking but one that needed to be told.  Our book club read the book and everyone loved it.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I loved this book as much as the first. I looked forward to getting into bed every night for a few minutes (which turned into a few hours) of reading.  Collins knows how to shift direction unexpectedly, leaving you wondering which twist might occur next.
B00EY8BRGU|2.0|Just can't feel the least bit invested in any of these characters. They obviously spent a fair amount of money on the production, but the whole thing just feels a little too smug over... what? There's no THERE there. And of course, parts of it are just plain improbable beyond plausibility (like the bank transfer shenanigans). Hold out for a free cable viewing on this one folks!
B00CF34B2I|5.0|Just discovered this game a few days ago and already love it. Almost as good as the game play on 360.
1452113432|5.0|I need to preface my review by saying I love those things small:  small apartments, small cars and, yes, small kitchens with extremely small and compact appliances.  I find it an adventure to prepare dinner using a toaster oven.  I mean, anybody can cook in a traditional kitchen with all the gadgets but it takes talent and skill to prepare a meaningful and memorable meal in a tiny space.  It was just that angle that attracted me to this book.  Most (or all) of these recipes were prepared in the author's tiny Paris kitchen.  Je salue cet exploit!  The artwork and general design layout of this cookbook may be one of the best arrangements I've ever seen:  very original and very fresh!  She uses French [language] frequently throughout the book but writes in such a way that it's very easy to decipher the meanings for those that don't speak Francais.  And, she provides \\"the best\\" glossary in the back of the book for anything that remains in question.  Little Miss Khoo is fun to read and I am particularly impressed with how she kept her ingredients fairly simple and easy.  I get lost with recipes requiring be coups of ingredients but you won't find that complication in this book.  Some of the ingredients are a little foreign to me, but this IS a French cookbook.  If I wanted an American experience I should buy an American cookbook, right?  I am happy to add this little book to my very restrictive collection!  Not just any book gets to stay in my kitchen!  Great job, Rachel!
B00B22ASUM|5.0|This book demonstrates how important pets are in our lives.  It also shows how a reason for improving ourselves and living a good life can be found in unexpected places.  It is a book of hope.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|this game is so fun!! you get to make your own pony vile and buy your favorite ponies!! I &hearts; it
B000OYC7A8|5.0|This DVD is amazing! A nice trip among Pink Floyd´s musics and Gilmour´s musics. I really enjoy it! I recommend.
B007THA4FI|5.0|Don't compare, just sit back and read and enjoy.  Well conceived characters, interesting plot.  Like a play you want to give a standing ovation.
B003Y3ZTGA|5.0|I love this album! After watching the part of me documentary/concert I had to buy! thanks kitty purry for making music that's truly beautiful!
B008602KQI|5.0|I was really impressed to see the Hunger Games movie! I had read all three books first, and I was suprised to see how well the first movie follows the first book! The movie was done so well, it was so interesting the whole time and even though it's over 2 hours it is so exciting that it goes by so fast. And I think the casting for all the characters are spot on also! Especially Katniss, Gale, Peeta, Rue, President Snow, just everyone!<br /><br />I highly recommend this movie. And please read the book also, reading it first definitely helps and helps you appreciate and understand the movie well.
1400096936|5.0|I can only recommend this book. It will keep you glued to every page, truly gripping and so real!! Mexico´s drug problem is no secret and I do believe that it has become part of their economy. Beautifully written. This is a master piece and has become one of my favorite books.
B007N9FKCY|5.0|If you are old enough to have been a fan of a certain Italian plumber back in the day or you happen to be in the market for a little bit of AWESOME then behold ....Bean's Quest! Anyone with thumbs can play this so it's a real gem to occupy little ones that need a distraction but, it is totally addictive for adults. DO NOT THINK EASY TO LEARN =SIMPLE TO MASTER.  This little gem will keep you engaged and entertained for hours on end so will power is a must. Beautifully rendered and masterfull eye to the details ...even the sound track is spot on. Don't let the low price fool you.  THIS game is perfect in every detail. Put a grin on your chin and play Beans Quest!
B0013TXA5Y|4.0|This book was fun, exciting, and fresh.  A Great Read! I'm Looking forward to reading the rest of the series.
B009NFHF0Q|1.0|Do yourself a favor a skip this one. I pushed through the first 60% telling myself it would get better<br /> When it didn't I was really upset. I don't even know how this book got published and how it has any positive ratings. By far the most random, dull, and overpriced book I've bought for my kindle so far.
B001P9EQH8|4.0|I bought this mini-amp to improve the sound levels coming out of my iPod Classic when used with a pair of (new) Sennheiser HD-280 headphones (64 ohms) .  I noticed I had to play the volume very close to max on the iPod to get the sound I wanted, so for $25, I said what the heck.  Let's see if the F5 can take some of the load off of my iPod.......<br /><br />  First setup was with the supplied cables -  iPod (out) to E5 (in), headphones to E5 (out).  I noticed very little difference in sound output; a little louder, no distortion, the bass boost worked.  I was slightly disappointing and felt I *maybe* got my $25 worth.  Read a few reviews which said to try the F5 with the (extra $) Line-out Docking cable (LOD) available here on Amazon. Ok...another $10.<br /><br />Second setup: Ipod LOD cable to E5(in), headphones to E5(out). I *really* wish I had turned down the E5 volume BEFORE I did this, as it almost blew out my eardrums! Wow.  What a difference.  At not even half volume on the E5, I had the music level I wanted, and it was incredible.  I really can't compare the overall sound quality with and without the amp, as I only had the headphones for a week, but doing a test back and forth, quality-wise, I can see no difference,  except that with the F5,  louder passages sound better through the midranges (no brassy-ness), and the low end, even without the booster, sounds better (more present, still clean). I especially enjoyed the bass riff in \\"Sympathy for the Devil\\" by the Stones.<br /><br />I am overall pretty happy with this amp, and hope it lasts.  I docked it one star because of the performance with the out-of-box cables, but looking at other reviews, that just might be my setup/components.
B00B5DWI2O|5.0|This is one of my favorites.  I will be looking for more of Arnalds!  This album works for the \\"romantic mood\\" inducement category too.
B0040I09RM|5.0|I am not a huge fan of violence and typically avoid the more gratuitous aspects, however, the story of Jax, his father's vision for the club and the decisions that he struggles with are well worth it and doesn't make it feel like it is gratuitous.  The show is gritty but I have fallen in love with these characters and keep only wanting it all to work out!
B005ZOBNOI|3.0|I am neutral with this book. It wasn't great and it wasn't bad. I would read it again...maybe. Hopefully the movie is a little better.
1451668945|5.0|Great book as all of Mary Higgins Clark.  Good mystery that keeps you intrigued! Put this on your reading list
B00821OX98|2.0|The soundtrack is worse than elevator music. Did they buy the music rights from some out of work soap opera composer? Shoot the piano player........please!!
B007J4T2G8|3.0|I must admit I only got this book for the reason that it seemed like everyone else in the world was reading it. Although I greatly appreciate E L James' writing style which was witty an easy to read, I don't care for the story too much. Personal preference mostly. If you like a little raciness then it's the classiest one of them all with great stylistic prose. So much better than a generic romance novel.
B00C6F624K|1.0|NO French subtitles (or Spanish), contrary to what is written on sleeve! Scam. But I like this great movie from F.F.Coppola!
0061124958|5.0|We read this to our children. They really enjoyed the story overall. I enjoyed reading it this time more than the first.
B007RFDQN4|5.0|Great movie about a man who created great theater for the masses...Great insight on his strengths and weaknesses...<br />Robert Downey Jr. is a master at his craft...probably lots of similarities...<br />A definite if you like old stuff...
B0071XO8RA|5.0|This series was simply pheonominal, with amazing characters in each of the books. I was really sad when Houston died though
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|Hard to put down! This book will have you rethinking events in your life. Life is not black and white, it is gray. Understanding is the key to getting through it.
B007GCY8FS|3.0|Fun to read, but all the same plot and out come. Jack Reacher always hitchhiking pick-up leading to trouble. He gets involved kills a few, beats a few, gets new clothes, takes a bath, mystery solved. Done
B004FHP9KA|5.0|I loved the movie! Good acting and writing. The special effects were spectacular! This is a very cerebral plot. Don't watch this unless you want to be challenged mentally.
B00DDXJRJG|4.0|I love this app. It makes an incredible difference in the sound. I found it very easy to use, thanks to another reviewer.
B00CRWJ7VC|5.0|The acting and writing were very good. Both Tom Hanks and Halle Barry gave their usual excellent performances. This is a thinking person's movie. Don't watch this for light entertainment. You need to be fully engaged.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|GREAT GAME!!!!!! I love this game and I believe you would enjoy it as well!!! Please give it a try! You will enjoy it!!
B008FYZIVY|5.0|This DVD set is one of the best entertainment purchases that I've ever made.  The writing, actors, characters, and history portrayed are superb.  I came to Downton Abbey only recently after hearing so much about the series from others.  I've already purchased Season 3, and I'm lookinh forward to actually watching Season 4, beginning in January 2014, on my local PBS station, WOSU-TV.  My favorite characters are Violet Crowley (Maggie Smith), Dowager Countess of Grantham and Charles Carson (Jim Carter), Butler.
B00AEFYK5M|5.0|This is the movie to be watched always - This movie is a beautiful life time story that may happen to anyone
B003JUGQ38|4.0|The story lines are very familiar but it is still fun to watch how they get out of their pickles.
B008CLI4N4|5.0|I was told to get into this series a while back so I took a leap of faith and just bought the whole first season. LOVED IT! All the discs worked and everything was shipped fast. Now to save up for season 2...
B006PZBR8S|5.0|Great entertaiment it keep you on you seat i watch it with my kids they really like it i will recommend
B00BVYLBP2|5.0|Could hardly wait for next episode. Two leads were fun to watch. I expect this will soon happen in real life.
B00BRUQ7ZY|4.0|A well written and well researched book that does NOT try to convey a specific religious point of view.  It seems to present documented events in THEIR context which leaves interpretation up to reader/believer. I can see this being an enjoyable book for both christians who are interested in the history of their religion and other interested readers with or without a specific religious orientation.
B00CGPPMKU|4.0|This app is fun, my kids love to play with it when they are bored in the car.  We try to make a game out of it.
B00D7Z4GQY|1.0|It was awful.it took me days to read this and I read it reluctantly thinking it was going to get better
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|Me and my husband enjoyed watching this movie together!!  It was a fun and exciting movie with a bunch of twists in it.
B00DC3DGSK|4.0|Buddy Guy is an icon in the world of guitar masters. Rhythm & Blues is a perfect example of why he is so revered by fans and the world's greatest musicians alike. He shows it all on this album.
B001N9ESQ4|5.0|I loved this movie, but after watching Before Sunset, I loved it even more!! I'm on the edge of my seat waiting to see Before Midnight.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|Good movie overall and similar to the book.  A little nerving for young kids but movie is clean and no actual killing is shown.
B0044XRIMW|5.0|My wife wanted an up to date copy available - our old VHS was in the letterbox format, and you miss much of the wonderful vistas which are part of the movie. Amazon's digital copy is excellent.  Superb story follows the true story pretty faithfully.  Julie Andrews and Christopher Plummer are magnificent and believable playing Maria and Captain VonTrapp.  The brutality of the Nazis was implied well in a family friendly movie.  My kids loved the movie, my wife has loved it from her first viewing on the TV years ago.  She was impressed by the cinematography she had never really appreciated on the small letterbox format.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I love this book... part 1 and 2 have kept me going for hours non stop.  The book I'm sure touches home to many women. We want the bad boy but we also want the loving and compassionate boy as well. Many of us come with a broken past looking and hoping for the right person to come along and heal those wounds.  This book has brought tears to my eyes. Sometimes it seems impossible but the power of love can go a long way.<br /><br />I would recommend this book to everyone..  even though i'm so late reading it myself. I think that men should read a book like this, maybe they wouldn't feel the need to be so withdrawn. Now time to download the next book. I'm so hoping for a happy ending.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|This was very well written. The emotions are real, the situations real and the possibilities real. I could definitely relate to some of the characters.
B00000JPH6|5.0|Having watched how they made this movie, I saw that it is truly a miracle.  Did you know it took ten people to run each of  the Skeksies??  (sp?)
B00EY8BRGU|4.0|This was a very entertaining and interesting twist on crime dramas. It's definitely worth the rent, but I will tell you (without any spoilers) that the ending left me with a very dissatisfied feeling.<br /><br />Maybe it's just a pet peeve of mine, but I hate it when a good movie cops out on the ending. A grand journey that leads you to like a Denny's.<br /><br />Think Shutter Island. You get an ending.. but it just seems shoe-horned.
B004A8ZWW4|5.0|A truly uplifting tale that actually moves you with excitement and tension, unlike most feel-goods that yawn you til the end.
B00DNDR29I|5.0|I hate making comparisons when you're impacted enough by something to actually write a review.  I think it's a cop-out, writing something that says \\"it sounds like ____\\" or \\"it reminds me of ____\\". We should have the creativity and intelligence to not refer to someone else when discussing an artist's work. But with this release by Janelle Monae, which blows me away even more than her first, I can't help but feel like those hippies felt in Woodstock when Sly and the Family Stone took the stage at 4:00 in the morning and shocked them out of their lysergic slumber, blowing every other band off the stage in the process. This album is like that moment, grabbing what remains of the music industry and fans and culture by the throat and forcing it to wake up and dance. We should feel lucky we're around to hear it.<br /><br />I am enamored by this album. It is so all over the place that I can barely keep up with it, in a good way. And unlike sprawling albums by others, this one is thematic and forceful and palatable - like spending a few hours at the dessert bar and sampling everything you can. Highlights are \\"Ghetto Woman\\" (in all honesty, the greatest track I've heard by anyone in years, an astonishing piece), \\"We Were Rock and Roll\\" (like finding a long lost time capsule from Don Kirshner's Rock Concert wash up on the beach), and \\"Primetime\\" (which takes me back to so many places, for some reason, that it's like a 4-minute sin). But these are just the very best moments on an album that is challenging yet approachable, and creatively rich.  She has established herself in just two albums as her own genre.  That's no mean feat in an age where everything seems like it's been \\"done before\\". Maybe that's why we're grasping for comparisons - there really aren't any.<br /><br />I saw Janelle Monae in 2011 and I was interested. But this is something much more. Every second of hype about Janelle Monae is backed up by everything you hear on this album, a sweet, funky, head-nodding ride.ide.
B001UV4XJ2|5.0|Everything as promised.  Fun for all the family.  Movie engaging and exciting, great visuals.  No complaints the whole saga is just FUN
B0060AY6FO|4.0|It was a good read, but the quality does not measure up to either Jane Austen or P.D. James original work.  I thought the denouement rather pedestrian.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|As usual, first class performance by the entire cast, and anything with Maggie Smith in it has to be wonderful!
B0012DP8A6|5.0|I forgot how good this movie is. I was 6yrs old when it came out. loved it then and love it now. except now I get to enjoy it with my 2 sons.
B002QE3CTY|4.0|Interesting-! I read and read, and I wasn't disappointed- I don't really know what's going on yet (since its book number 1), but- onto book 2!!!
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|Cant say enough about this great series.  Funny, intense and drama filled.  Stop reading this and go watch it now!!
B00EB6F1TY|5.0|After reading some other reviews I didn't expect a whole lot from this movie. I was pleasantly surprised by it. This movie was all about Tony getting back to his roots, doing what only he can do. I seriously hope RDJ will continue as Tony Stark/IronMan. This franchise would be nothing without him.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Somehow a British accent and good acting makes what is basically a period piece soap opera irresistible.  Every episode ends with the need to go to the next episode, and on and on.  Watch it once and you're hooked.
B00ECU34ZM|4.0|The movie was alright, but it did lack in areas (those typical in a Tom Cruise movie).  The storyline was great, but I think a different actor would have made the movie more over the top.
B007RCJNDE|5.0|I have just realised that my review of the Towers of Midnight should have been the review of A Memory of Light, so I will just repeat that it would be great if the series were continued by Brandon Sanderson.
B0081SRJSY|5.0|Great game. Clean, crisp version. Gameplay is way easier than in physical board game, and easy to play anywhere! Highly recommended!
B00B0X4PIO|5.0|Khaled Hosseini is a delightful wordsmith.  His descriptive passages are a joy to read. The story line keeps one drawn to the drama of living in a war torn and corrupt country, where lives are of no importance.
B00BIK3FAI|5.0|My 4 y.o. daughter's commentary: it is just a dream story that is fun. My mommy helped me find all the coins.  . Other kids will like this.  And at night they might have a dream about it just like I did.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Everyone Will love this game, u can take care of a horse buy clothing, train your horse to jump or barrel race.
1438074085|4.0|I bought this a a gift for my sister and she likes it. She is using it for her review.
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|You can't use parenthesis. this makes it harder to use for algebra sometimes. It is a good calculator though. They should add parenthesis.
B00EY8BRGU|4.0|My family and I rented this movie thinking that it would be a discent family movie.  What we got instead was a very good movie with many plot twist that left us all happy.
B001GISLE2|5.0|Seventh Tree is a fantastic album. But, this Tour Edition special release sincerely makes it perfect. The live tracks are incredible (check out the pop-rocky Happiness and the psychedelic tingled Little Bird). My only criticism to this release is that only a few tracks from the concert are here (I coulda used A&E and the live version of Clowns) and that there ir no 'Play All' option. Thus, you go back to the main menu every time a song ends.<br /><br />Other than that, this is a definite must have for any Goldfrapp fan, and for anyone interested in diving into the sea of Goldfrapp.
B008YU0AOE|5.0|This app is very well done and the math is very accurate. I have had no glitches so far,and it was free.
B00991TCOG|5.0|I didnt realize how much I would miss the video parts! What more can be said about Lindsey Sterling! Super
B009UZBLSG|1.0|It doesnt charge your device as it must to be. I need to disconnect it from TV and connect to charger because while its connecting to TV and to charger from slimport its didnt work
B0083ZRAJS|5.0|I would recommend reading thus book! It was very good. Not at like the movie but good. Not very long either.
1600108512|5.0|The art work was breath-taking and the story was so good. At time it was hard to follow along, but I believe it is my own fault since I am so use to the movie. But I love it!
B008K6HN8I|1.0|I cannot install apps that are of interest to me you only have apps that are of interest to americans sold through amazon, you are restricting my rights to buy from other sources
B00EEDJM2Q|5.0|I enjoy this game a lot.  Enough challenge to keep me interested...and plenty of levels to choose from!  Addictive.... &quot;just one more board&quot; is always like 10!!
B008G8SFGO|5.0|This has to be the best Kiss album since Revenge!!!  Not one bad song on this album.  The Devil is me, and Shout Mercy are two of my favorite songs on this album.  I look forward to the next Kiss album with this lineup.
B008FTAAG2|5.0|Between the metalcore/industrial riffs and her amazingly rough vocals, Blood is by far my favorite album from an already exceptional band.
0140282033|5.0|I watched the movie, Chocolat, several years ago, so I recently decided it was time to read the book. Perhaps I wasn't paying close enough attention when I watched the movie, but I expected something very different when I sat down to read the book. I expected the book to be more... romantic, sensual... Instead I found it to be an exploration of the effects of intolerance. Harris takes the intolerance so rife in our world and concentrates it in one small community showing how limiting we can be when we refuse to see beyond that which we've always been taught. She deftly explores the effects of exclusionary behavior and the harm of not bothering to get to know other people. With the story set around a newcomer who opens a chocolate store during Lent and the priest who opposes not only the chocolate shop but her mere presence, the town seems divided down the middle with people willing to blind themselves to other people's pain in order to maintain the status quo of their lives. I'm not sure the book was intended to make me feel sad, but it often did because it so aptly displayed how divisive human beings can be toward one another while wrapping their judgment up in a warped version of religious righteousness or even concern. Chocolat is a thought-provoking, entertaining book with characters that touch the heart and take up residence in one's imagination.
B00CAJMGDI|5.0|The juxtaposition of exceptional violin music over an electronic dance music beat literally makes dance. I can't not move when I listen to her work.
B004HWYTP4|5.0|Great entertainment. CIA against the CIA retirees. Right vs wrong. Impossible situations overcome. Amazing action. It's a movie that gives hope.
B006K1C0MO|5.0|Gojira is already an exceptional Black Metal band that pushes the the borders of the genre to new heights but this album is profound.
B001LX2J22|4.0|Love the entire Hannibal series. Brilliant acting, writing and directing. Great storytelling! I enjoyed watching this movie again even more after seeing the tv series.
B009MYARIK|3.0|Two of my all-time favorite books are by Sophie Kinsella...Can You Keep a Secret & The Undomestic Goddess. Wedding Night will not be on my list of favorites, but it was still laugh out loud funny and a classic 'out of the box' Kinsella premise. As far as engagement & interest, I would rate it similarly to Kinsella's Twenties Girl...it takes some time to get into the story and there is a lot going on...you have to persevere to about 50% until you become invested, but then it is definitely worth it.  It is better than Twenties Girl, IMO...the story's quirkiness and humor is more along the lines of Kinsella's novel I've Got Your Number. It's not her best book, but it was still enjoyable.
B001NIA27E|2.0|Let me preface this by saying I'm watching this movie for the first time 15+ years after it came out.  I've seen Brosnan in other movies where he was perfectly capable and Linda Hamilton has done okay work in other films as well but in this one, they just seem so stilted.  When you seen such bad acting and dialogue across the board, you really have to blame the directing and writing.  This is a cookie cutter disaster film that becomes entirely predictable about 20 minutes in.  If you see it on TV and you're bored, it's worth a watch but don't spend any money on it.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Downton Abbey is consistently top quality.  The sets are lush; the costuming is perfect; the acting is spot on. There is a reason why people heap praise on this series. The writing reflects the historical and social setting so well while engaging in very satisfying storytelling.  This is one of my favorite programs ever!.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I have to admit that I did not want to read these books but thanks to a friend she convinced me and I am so glad she did. In my opinion the first book was the best and the 2nd and 3rd book took longer to read but it was worth it. Now I can't wait for the movies. :)
0345530578|5.0|Industrial strength Grisham.  Fun read.  Interesting plot.  Don't worry. You  won't figure it out early.<br />This Grisham book is right up there with The Firm and Runaway Jury.  I think it will lend itself very well to the screen.  Five stars..
B006MW3UZW|4.0|I don't really watch the show but my girlfriend seems to enjoy it enough to watch an episode whenever she can. It rare for her to sit and watch tv, so for it to grab her attention, it must be good.
B00EY8BRGU|5.0|I love the twists and turns, but especially the consistent energy of the movie.  Good story line - nice surprises!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|The book was very interesting.  Had a hard rime putting it down.  Can't wait for the next one!  Excellent story.
0446576220|5.0|Tony writes in a simple way, like a friend telling you a story. It makes the book easy and pleasant to read it.<br />Despite that, it's a cool entrepreneurship history, and a inspiring case about how people and culture can produce great results.
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|Makes you think differently about what people need out of relationships. It's helpful. You'll find yourself applying these concepts in every relationship in your life.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|The sexual satisfation and só on is repeated tôo many times. Otherwise An. Interesting Storage well written just tôo repetitive
0843178167|5.0|All these books are really cute and make ideal gifts. I gave this to my friend for her birthday and she loves it!
B001RHOJSE|5.0|What would you have donde if refugindo to fulfill The ordem you receites you would be sent to The gás chambre yourself?would you have refused? Butantã of course Eichman did not have to refuse. Just resign or volunteer to fight The sovietes instead of organizing The dishuman transport of jews to Poland to be killed there.
B0092EE5HY|4.0|Collection of short story's, all based on the same character and all written by George R. R. Martin. It's a little slow getting started but well worth staying with it. I liked the book.
B00EY8BRGU|5.0|This movie was funny and it kept my attention. I absolutely loved this movie. Totally hilarious, highly recommended!!!!! Great directing!!!! Awesome Cast
B003G4W49C|4.0|I liked the story line on this book. I must admit that my motivation in reading it was wanting to know the story line for the upcoming release of the movie &#34;Ender's Game&#34;. Can't wait to see the movie.
B0036ULAXW|5.0|Every so often you buy and play a disc, or set of discs, and know as instantly and instinctively as the conductor who first directed the recorded performance that this is how the music is meant to sound and to go. There is a rightness about Suitner's interpretations which goes straight to the heart: he understands that these are not so much grand, monumental compositions which arouse our admiration but rather visceral, \\"heart-on-the-sleeve\\" music which engages our emotions and has its roots in folksong and dance.<br /><br />Thus it matters less that the Berlin Staatskapelle is not the Berlin Philharmonic or the LSO, as a certain roughness and drive is wholly in keeping with Suitner's conception; the orchestra really sound as if they enjoying playing Dvorak and there is no hint of the smooth technician in their approach. A little more edge on the woodwind and some lack of sheen on the strings is entirely welcome. Suitner manages to encompass both the pathos and the drama of these wonderful symphonies with a kind of Schubertian humanity.<br /><br />All this on five discs at a super-bargain price. The analogue recordings from 1979-83 are just a little dim and dry; no-one would mistake them for state-of-the-art modern digital but they are more than serviceable. This is a neat, slim, tastefully packaged set with a short, informative essay and some brief biographical information on Suitner, providing briliant, unpretentious, wholly idiomatic performances - the perfect introduction to Dvorak's symphonies.<br /><br />Yes, I know: the conventional wisdom still anoints Istvan Kertesz's late '60s Dvorak cycle on Decca as definitive. Yes, the Kertesz set still sounds wonderful forty years on, but here's a handsome alternative that costs just a fraction of the Decca. In fact, this set would be a steal at twice the price Edel is asking. Austrian-born Otmar Suitner was a pupil of the great Clemens Krauss, and a lot of that esteemed maestro's genius for idiomatically inflected, songful performance is present here. These are not hard-core, high-drama performances where every climax is rushed and dynamic contrasts are pushed out to Wagnerian extremes. Instead, Suitner reveals Dvorak's linkages to Schubert: the gorgeous melodies positively dance out of your speakers! Not that Suitner doesn't understand the drama of Dvorak's darker moments: the performance of the Seventh Symphony reminds anyone with ears to hear that Dvorak was a structurally disciplined Great Composer of tremendous range and depth, not just a charming peddler of folk tunes haphazardly thrown together.gful performance is present here.

B003ZHR6RK|5.0|This review is from: The Shawshank Redemption [Blu-ray] (Blu-ray)<br />Like with most people I took forever to see this movie, but that was actually because I knew the ending. In the end one day I decided I'd had enough and streamed the movie. Boy was I glad I did.<br /><br />Like with Bicentinal Man, Poweder, Slumdog Millionaire and The Invisible I was amazed at how a movie with such a simple premise could be so powerful and emotion creating. I got almost every emotion from this movie, albeit not at a huge scale as I could predict some scenes. I was also very impressed at how the movie gave a realistic description of a world within a world and how prisioners start up their own culture. Also the great concept of &#34;Institutionalized&#34;, before I watched this movie had someone mentioned this concept I would just brushed them off now, I knew what Red means. I am used to living on a limited budget, the concept of having lots of money to burn and not save, feels foreign to me now.<br /><br />Also despite moderate pacing, there was never a dull moment in the movie untill we see the medow Andy talked about. That part could've been shortened by many seconds. The only other gripe (SLIGHT SPOILER ALERT, SO JUMP TO THE NEXT PARAGRAPH) involves the giant posters, but that should be easy to figure out.<br /><br />Very good movie 5/5 Critique, 4.8 personally.
B006B9F6CQ|5.0|Love Love Love IT!!!<br />(although she could<br />Performed a couple more of her old stuff thrown in! But still phenomenal!!!!
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|Great read. Have passed the title on to my friends and relatives. A bit of mystery and romance,laughter and tears.
B0012GTZC0|5.0|One of my favorites.  Wish he would write more. WWII novels are hard to put down as I was just a very little girl back then and these writings put together a lot of<br />pieces of history.
030759565X|5.0|I bought this 1) because it's such a cute name and 2) because I had heard good things about it.  I have never read Deb Perelman's blog.  But I enjoy this cookbook so much, that now I'm going to have to read her blog!  I am looking forward to trying alot of the recipes from this book.
B0085CXVOC|3.0|Light and fluffy action flick. It can be pretty unbelievable at times but it's somewhat entertaining. There are  worse movies out there.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|This book was awesome. The author played me like a fiddle. I was inspired and now have a stronger appreciation for the people in my life.
B00DWHWOFC|5.0|If you love these types of puzzles this a a very good game.  Two different logic games and lots of puzzles!
B009LMTDL0|5.0|I give Sheryl Sandberg a standing ovation for having the guts to write this book.  It was balanced, incredibly well researched and needed to be said.  Both men and women of all ages could benefit from reading this.
B000002LFZ|5.0|This CD took me way way back!  I can't keep still when this is playing.  I love love love it!
0788812807|5.0|Shipped quickly, in good condition, and as good as I remember.  My little girl is more into princesses at the moment, but that doesn't stop me from popping it in while I'm cleaning and singing along :)
B00622D3BS|3.0|Somewhat pointless and certainly dumb in many places.  Disappointing considering the actors involved.  I'm guessing the actors were disappointed with the final result as well.  Sleep walking through many scenes.
B002WTOXUK|5.0|Easy to purchase through my sony WiFi/BluRay player (which doesn't always make things as easy as my PS3 did)...good quality and reaction time on rewinding.  Overall, very happy!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Finally a game I like, feel like I'm playing clue. Worth the download. If you like puzzles you will like this game
0199270295|3.0|Organic Chemistry is an extremely difficult and complex science.<br /><br />Despite the rave reviews, I did not find this particular book any clearer than the rest, (except for Barron's which is much simpler treatment.)  Organic Chemistry will test you to the limits of your scientific, language, reading compression, memory and graphics understanding.<br /><br />One criticism is that this book has small print and is 1200 pages long (heavy). It's no bed time read.<br /><br />If you need a book for chemists, this may be it. If you are preparing for medical school, John Murray's book may be better for biologists although it is not a simple read either.<br /><br />I was hoping for a book that would simplify things in Organic Chemistry. What I got was a through but difficult read.
B00E8B1P9M|3.0|Plenty of action, however did not keep you on the edge of your seat, good job by the actors involved, good entertainment,
B00CB4ET0K|3.0|I would give this game more stars, but it constantly glitches and is delayed. It's a great game easy to use!
B000WOT41K|5.0|The music is as good as I remembered.  Great, motivating work music. Have listened to it over and over and never had one second of remorse.
B006M7JCC2|5.0|Such a great read!!!  A truly u souring story of what really is..  Strongky Recommend to anyone and everyone who has cancer or knows someone with it..  Which really is EVERYONE!!!
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|It is not my favorite genre, but I loved it. I was totally hooked into. Greatly written. My first reading from Neil Gaiman.
B00C50NV2M|4.0|I found the glasses to be great.  I wear eyeglasses, and these fit over my eyeglasses perfectly.  There is a little ledge where the 3D glasses naturally rest on your eyeglasses and it works well.  The \\"glass\\" portion of the glasses is plastic as you may expect.  The problem with the plastic eye pieces is they scratch EASILY.  If you plan of placing these in a bag with other 3D glasses, be aware that they may and probably will scratch while being in there.<br /><br />With this minor issue, the glasses are still a good 4 out of 5 stars.  I do recommend them.
B0037QM8YA|5.0|Precious was really good and sad on how she gotten abused and that she's still in junior high when she was still pregnant
B00B89WXYS|5.0|Love this album - does not disappoint! A great purchase for the punk-rock lover. A combination of both peppy punk music and the mellow jams.
B00CTSDDVO|4.0|The movie: love the fun and action, and the character interactions between the crew. This is coming from a fan who loved Star Trek and have movies and TV series from the prime timeline. The only part I felt a bit cheezy was when Spock does his version of \\"Kkkkkhhhhaaaannnnn!!!!!\\"<br /><br />I purchased the 3D package, which contains three discs: 3D blu-ray, blu-ray, and DVD with digital copy code. I played 3D and blu-ray discs on my 125\\" 3D 1080p projector with 7.2, and boy did it give me the cinematic experience - but better than theater since my 7.2 speakers are closer.<br /><br />The pictures are sharp but have a cinema feel to it, which I like a lot. The sound effect for explosions,fire fights, space flights, are all clearly articulated. I can hear the distribution of the sound pieces from different speakers.<br /><br />3D is like in theater. The in-screen depth are pretty good in many places. The out-of-screen is minimal, but there is one memorable scene at the opening sequence, when the Nibirians throw spears at Kirk and Bones. I felt they were coming at me and gonna hit between my eyes!<br /><br />The extra features are short clips, and I'm disappointed to hear that the special features were divided up for packages from other retailers like Best Buy and Target, and Walmart's version has the discs in USS Vengeance, much like 2009 Star Trek's discs in Nu-Enterprise from Target.
B0015RFCZ0|5.0|Could watch it a thousand times.  The stars and music are wonderful.  Listen to the soundtrack while I take walks.
B009NH6AOQ|5.0|The Walking dead is the best tv series out there right now and the cult following is becoming massive! Season 3 is fantastic, with new challenges for the group and new villians too! With the season 4 premiere about a month away, what better time than now to buy this sure to be collectable DVD series! Highly Recommended!!!
B00EI6E17A|5.0|Lady Gaga never disappoints!  I am so glad she's back. I can't wait until she's in concert in LA again.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Beautiful visual and quality acting make this show a treat to watch. With such a wide ensemble there are plenty of characters to be attached to
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|I have recommended this book to friends who also loved it.  I read it before it made the best sellers list and can see why it did the list.  It had everything and had a great ending to boot.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|I love playing this game so much that I use my kid's fb accounts to play while they are at school! I like the various rooms to play in and the differing themes of each. Play credits are added each day. On a few occasions, I've encountered some connection problems and was &quot;compensated&quot; extra bingo credits upon my next log in. The accents of the bingo callers in the different rooms are amusing.
B00B2FLDRQ|5.0|What more can be written about this book. It is a book you start and can't put down. It is touching,clever,and a one in a lifetime read.
B002NVTSGQ|5.0|So funny and always with a heart-warming ending! A real treat to watch. I would recommend to anyone who loves shows like How I Met Your Mother.
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|This movie made me feel like a kid again. It was very fun and I will be viewing it again.
B00CO52NLI|4.0|This is a well thought out game, with amazing 3d graphics, im very impressed so far, just wish it didnt take so long for people to pop in to adopt
B001H4R4LQ|5.0|this one was the most exciting volume in my opinion. I could not put it down, I sat for hours reading two hundred or so pages each day. If you like the Inheritance cycle, get it!
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|I will read this author again. I had no idea what this book was about before I read it. It really kept my interest! Good summer read!
B00CATSONE|3.0|Interesting facts about him.  I thought it was going to be a longer read. That's probably why it was free. Still enjoyed though.
B000SEIK2S|4.0|Enjoyed the concept. The government is prevalent but never explained in the stories, somewhat like life. The story moves along well and I recommend this book.
B008YKGQR4|4.0|I love the fact that everything shows up as if I were on my regular computer. I don't like the fact that when I go to play or open a game it keeps defaulting back to the start page - very aggravating to have to keep loading it over and over...<br /><br />Over all if it didn't have that problem I would rate it a perfect 5 Star!
B000001F26|4.0|The title itself saids it all completely.  It is indeed a great collection of his best and early songs.  Really liked all the songs on this album.  Recommend it for anyone who loves Eric Clapton.
B00AEBEQW8|5.0|My 6 year old reads this to us every night. 2 weeks now and no signs of stopping. Great concept, illustrations, ending!
B000ICKPOQ|5.0|I love stargate anything lol wish they would make more. I am nw reading the books. I also truly believe there is some truth to the idea of it.
B003DWU98U|5.0|Brilliant performances by Sandy Dennis and George Segal. As to Taylor/Burton combo, it hardly ever got better than this. Period.
0763644765|5.0|I ordered this book before I wanted to start potty training my son. The book itself has very few words, but the expressions on the babies face help tell the story and my little guy just loved it. He quickly learned all the words and would read the book to me. For whatever reason this was his favorite book for at least a year, and now that he is 4, he still likes to read this one.
B001ANSS5K|5.0|John Green's ability to create characters and then craft lives for them is nothing short of amazing.  He taps into the hopes, troubles, insecurities and struggles that we all feel as we navigate the world.
B003TQKVGU|5.0|I have this book on Kindle edition as well as paperback.  This book has changed the way I think, and I am sure that this book has improved my life.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I added this book to my Kindle before taking a trip.  I couldn't put it down and went through a wide variety of emotions while reading it.  I don't want to mention the plot too much because I think it is best that the reader just take a journey with these young people.<br />It was a life-changer for me.
B009ZQJ1G4|1.0|Who could have foreseen the pitfalls of portraying an emotionless society in a movie? Anyone who gave it a second of thought, I suppose. This is an idea that should have been killed before it made it's way from the cocktail napkin to the screen. Truly simplistic and insulting. There's is better distopian science fiction out there.
B00AIBZJLG|5.0|I love CDS. I loved this when I saw it originally. I'm really glad they came out with a DVD so my grown up kids can see it also since they missed the one-day movie date.
B00B52F278|5.0|I have yet to finish this series set, but the parts that I have seen thus far is excellent and worthy of purchase by anyone who love historical events.
B00ARF93AQ|1.0|it is bad, not so bad that is becomes appealing, just more regurgitated rehashed drivel with so so special effects...dont bother
B0072OFM28|5.0|I CAN NOT GET ENOUGH OF THESE KILLER SERIES TO THE POINT THAT i HAVE STARTED WATCHING THEM OVER AGAIN .
B001NLL93W|5.0|I truly loved all three of The Mortal Instrument Series books, but this was the best one yet. The story was captivating and since I have always been a great fan of Clary and Jace (oh Jace and his witty answers &#34;swoon&#34;), this book did not disappoint. All in all, the series could have ended here, but i am excited to read the three next installments of the series.
B004HW7JMO|5.0|This first series is one of the best and it should have won &#34;Best TV Series&#34; and &#34;Best Mini Series.&#34;
B001NLKZUA|5.0|City of Ashes did not disappoint. I liked the way Clary found her talent in &#34;creating&#34; new runes. I was a bit unsure of how to deal with my feelings about Clary and Jace having this attraction for each other which had nothing to do with love for a sibling.. but keep on reading, it is worth it.
B003PIUBZS|5.0|This Series is one of the best that I have ever seen thus far. I plan to watch it over again.
B008LXZFH6|3.0|Heard a lot about this movie. Funny enough. Not hilarious. Over all Will Ferrell is a funny guy and any of his movies are good!!!
B004ZRV3AU|5.0|Simply ... this works. The roller scores bottle perfectly. Place in a hot/cold water bath and shazam it's done. Word of warning, you only need a light score and don't go backwards.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|Great book that is different from other war stories as this one seems to be relieved rather than just telling the  story.  It's done very well and you seem to fill apart of the action took me some time to read this book but always kept coming back ( super slow reader).<br />Recommend!
B009LDCXNY|5.0|Supernatural is one of the best and most underated shows on TV. Season 8 was a return to form after, solidly entertaining, but sometimes patchy seasons in seasons 6 & 7. Season 8 reinvigorated the characters of Sam and Dean Winchester and their relationship, which is key and cenrtal to the story. It launched new mythology and took the story in a direction that will see it through seasons 9 and beyond. Just when you think the show can't surprise you any more, it pulls out a finale that blows everyone away. Damn fine TV. Beautifully made. Every episode looks like a mini movie. The writing is some of the finest on the box and the performances are consistently powerful week in week out. Seriously, more people should be watching this show.
B008469DGY|5.0|Great Game On MY razor MaxX. NoT AS Controllable On My Kindle HD fire. Can't wait For More Content And Levels To Play!
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|You would not think that a story about terminal children would be beautiful or funny.  This book is both ... simply magical.  I cried, laughed, and cried some more.  Oddly enough, it gave me hope.
0316017930|5.0|Loved the entire book - purchased Blink as well as The Turning Point because of the first read. Highly recommend.
B003YFIUW8|5.0|Absolutely amazing! Wasn't to sure at first about reading a book from the perspective of a 5 year old but once I got started I couldn't but it down! Definitely makes you think and be thankful for what you have.
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|Love it!! Those minions are AWESOME!! Nothing like the original, my daughter loves both but she laughed more with part one.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|It is a show worth watching, UNLIKE all the garbage they call entertainment these days. Great writers and acting, I forget it is not real life.
B008QMMEOE|2.0|similar but not as good as tozzle available via apple.  My 2 year old went through all puzzles in 2 hrs.
B005PK1G76|5.0|I bought these for my Jogging stroller and it's awesome.  The price Is great.  I just bought a Britax brand for 30.00 for my new baby's Britax stroller and really they're about the same except this one is just a great deal.  Would definetly recommend it. Hands down.
B004LOMB2Q|4.0|I really enjoy this app and all its features. It is so powerful that I don't think I am using it to its fullest yet. But it is very handy and allows you  to organize so many things and thoughts and ideas.  I think it works well for my ADD mind.
B00DLKXF3A|5.0|Avenged sevenfold was always a band to me i didnt dislike but at the same time never put them up to a standard of genious mucisians. But this new direction they have taken with hail to the king is something worth looking at, when heard the first single \\"hail to the king\\" i could immediatley hear the change in style, they made the music more about riffs and slowing down to show their true talent as mucisians. The band really took on a late 80s metallica and megadeth sound. The song planets really shined on this record for me, over all i give this album 4.4 stars. I hope this isnt a one time deal because this album is great.
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|Like this a lot. It took me some time to get into it because the items r very hidden which makes it almost too challenging at first but once u give it time and patience it gets addictive. It also took time to figure out all the tools and how they work and I think there are way way way too many words but I found that if u actually read them it can be helpful although I still think I am probably missing a lot due to not fully understanding the game but still fun.
B00D4ABW82|5.0|Great band and the CD is amazing<br />Arrived very promptly and I was happy with the packaging around it. Solid product
B00AZL3PBK|5.0|I LOVE this game!!! it reminds me of super Mario brothers on nintendo. I've already spent hours playing and I just got the game yesterday.
B00425S1H8|5.0|The Pluggable USB to RS-232 DB9 Serial Adapter was just what I needed to get my telescope connected to my computer. Thanks a million, Plugable Technologies.
B00EI6E17A|5.0|More of the same sound with a good beat.  Haven't heard the whole album but will check it out soon.
B0001XPZGA|5.0|Sounds great. No complaints. Super excited that I got it and can't wait to get more if I don't have the same problem I had on my other album.
B00BY8DIT2|4.0|Not mentioned by many is the average sound of the mix in general, OK but not great. I find many of Joe's discs have a hard nasty edge to them, making me pass them by reluctantly. The drums are pretty well recorded here but the vocals overdriven, hard sounding.......too bad. Guitar tone is just average. Horns thin & brittle. On a good system too edgy on most cuts....not a criticism of the artists...just a wish they raise the bar to a higher level on the recording quality. Robert Ludwig who mastered this is a \\"god\\" from the older analog days. One of the best...I was expecting a better result. Maybe next time. Please!!!!!!!! Some of us are listening on quality systems...it will enhance our experience greatly! Talent this good should demand it. Once you hear it you won't go back. That being said - Close To My Fire is stunning.....I'll Love You More Than You'll Ever Know - great....If I Tell You I Love you...great - basically the slower tracks. Checked out all of Beth's discs on Amazon and selectively bought other tracks off her repertoire...A great find. Beth has that quirky Amy Winehouse delivery that hooks you and reels you in...I took off one star (could have been two) only for the recording quality. Check out Leonard Cohen's \\"Ten New Songs\\" or Shirley Horns \\"You Won't Forget Me\\" to get A+ recordings.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I have been looking for a fun and entertaining game and I found just the one being a horse lover!!!
B003XMUFGQ|1.0|WOW this is a low energy mail in........ I'm glad Eric finally hooked up with a good string section.....I can throw away my Bert Kaempfert CD's now....maybe even Mitch Miller...
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|I've had this app for awhile now and its fun and entertaining, keeps me occupied for awhile..you would love this game !
B005HEF8OC|4.0|Great Quality in the video. As a Star Trek Fan the story line and scenes are a bit of a stretch.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|This book was a great, fascinating read.  The author took great care to not disclose classified information while lambasting the numerous upper echelon military and political officials who did.<br /><br />Anyone who has read any of the fictional Lee Child books about his invincible protagonist \\"Jack Reacher\\" will likely feel as though they're reading a \\"Jack Reacher\\" novel.  However, this guy is real, and he tells a compelling story that slowly builds to a suspenseful crescendo with an ending that we are all, now, familiar with.<br /><br />The author spends an appropriate amount of time discussing SEAL training and its challenges.  Being retired U.S. Army, I'll say that I was a bit skeptical about the SEALS before I read this book.  I have many friends in the Special Operations community, and I know how well trained our soldiers, Rangers, Special Forces, and all of our Special Operations people are.  Admittedly, I had a natural bias about the Army's Delta Force, because I know how lethal and precise they are.  However, reading the author's accounts of being integrated with the many facets of Special Operations elements working in Iraq, Afghanistan, and all over the world, I came away with a new admiration and respect for the folks in the DEVGRU/SEAL echelons.<br /><br />Even the author was respectful of his work with these other branches of service while maintaining a healthy competitive attitude that only makes these folks more motivated - and deadly serious - about what they do.<br /><br />I don't think that it's necessary to do a story summary, here.  I'll just say that this book will appeal to even the most casual reader because it is not inundated with jargon and acronyms that would appeal only to folks in the military (or formerly in the military).<br /><br />I found the author's candid comments about the deadly nature of what they do and the occasional jab at politicians who take credit for their actions to be refreshing.  He (the author) didn't overdo this, but he spoke the truth (from his perspective).<br /><br />Also, I could relate to what he was saying because, having served in the military for a quarter century, I know how it feels to do a difficult job...while politicians casually discuss what soldiers/sailors/airmen/marines do over coffee and croissants back in Washington, D.C.  We take an oath, and we are duty bound to get the mission accomplished regardless of our personal feelings.<br /><br />The author also takes the time, pointedly, to give credit to the CIA folks who diligently tracked Osama Bin Laden for years and years, without fail.  The author describes the poignant scene where the female CIA agent realizes that, yes, Osama Bin Laden is alive no more.  It's a highly emotional moment that goes beyond the feeling of victory because it doesn't really bring back so many innocents who died because of him.<br /><br />So, I encourage you to read the book.  If you're an action junkie, you'll get a realistic dose of what it's like to be in the shoes/boots of a \\"Special Ops\\" expert.<br />If you're more philosophic, then you'll gain some perspective of what it's like to be in harm's way - and what the thought process is of these special people who do this type of work.<br /><br />As an American, be proud that we have people who volunteer for this type of duty.  While we sleep and go about our private lives, there are countless/nameless warriors out there protecting us from harm.<br /><br />Much of the proceeds of this book go to charities (and families of the fallen) related to the author's former line of work.<br /><br />Next time that you see a member of our military passing through in an airport or wherever, consider thanking them for their service.<br /><br />Every day, every hour, every minute, we have authentic heroes who are \\"out there\\" (often in lonely, isolated places) watching over all of us 24/7, thank goodness.  God bless 'em all.but he spoke the truth (from his perspective).<br /><br />Also, I could relate to what he was saying because, having served in the military for a quarter century, I know how it feels to do a difficult job...while politicians casually discuss what soldiers/sailors/airmen/marines do over coffee and croissants back in Washington, D.C.

B002ZBN13A|4.0|This first album from Evanescence is magical in the blending of vocal style with at time driving music. This is usually not my genre of music but ever since I first heard My Immortal I have toyed with getting this album. It is now 10 years later, I rarely hear Evanescence on the radio anymore and this album popped up on Amazon for a great price and I one clicked it right into my collection. I tell you this music is timeless.
0307895475|5.0|wow this is a big book i think i will pass this game next year when i finish the rest of my other games
B00CRS5HII|5.0|On my first listen through I liked every song! County with a bit of soul and blues mixed in. The reduced price was a nice bonus.
B005LJK3AC|5.0|This movie had me laughing out loud!  The cast is great--and Jennifer Aniston and Colin Farrell, in particular, do fabulous jobs out of character.
B00EH49DXA|5.0|Love this single. I like it much better than the original. The beat has more depth and the lyrics really resonate with what I am going through in my life. Cats really do help you get back your power if you study them in depth.
B004U8ZH8S|5.0|Great movie and wonderful color in HD! Love the theme and music. Excellent animation, also. This is an excellent movie for family movie night.
0316056871|4.0|The reader is given a window into a sharp wit and competitive spirit.  Too much vulgar, &#34;I can be as dirty as the boys&#34; language for my taste, however.
B006LSZECO|4.0|I had trouble getting into this book initially, then couldn't put it down after the first few chapters. It will lead to some great discussion at our book club!
0451169514|5.0|Tightly woven story that engages the reader from the first page.  This is a page turner; hard to put down!
B0018QOIXU|3.0|Her vocals are great as usual, I'm just not a fan of the musical style for this particular album. I prefer 21 for the musical style and the sheer powerful growth it shows. If you like the show stopping vocals Adele is famous for,  this album may be a bit tame for the lack of sheer powerful songs, but if you're interested in her more quiet vocal styles then this will be a nice taste of her beginnings. Enjoy!
B0018RWD6S|5.0|How can one go wrong with the coupling of two of the best in the musical industry?  Mellow and easy listening.
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|I am addicted. I play it daily. keep the games like this coming.  I do wish the energy levels didn't run out so fast but other than that it is a good memory game to find al the pieces before time runs out
1609611543|5.0|I'm half way through the book,it's been very interesting.I started taking wheat out of my diet a couple of weeks before I recieved the  book.I'm feeling so much better without the wheat.I'm also juicing everyday and happy that I getting healthier and feeling better,have more energy,sleep better,and my joints don't hurt like they used to.I've only lost a couple of pounds but I'm not stopping this is a real life change.Thanks Dr.Davis for writing these books.I've been what I though was good,clean and healthy for a few years now and just couldn't get rid of this Wheat Belly.But i just fell it and know that I'm going to get my sexy back
B008S80OU2|4.0|Awesome classic rock material, I love it, if you're a big fan, this one is for You , enjoy it
B003YL4LYI|5.0|Cant wait for the rest of the series!<br />Author needs to speed things up if he wants to stay ahead of hbo.
B00BOLE7X0|1.0|I have not looked at this movie.  It is not what I wanted as it was over the internet.  I wanted a hard copy, the DVD and seem to have pressed the wrong button.  My loss and Amazon's gain.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I really like  this game but I was thinking u guys could make a Minion village like smurfs village .
B005XQLBU4|5.0|I really liked it, and can tell you that it delivers exactly what it promises. Even though it has an upgrade and repair mechanic, it doesn't mean that it is easy to keep advancing. Needed both strategy and ability, it's great for anyone! I highly recommend it!
B001NLKZUA|4.0|Quick read, some funny moments. Not going to change your life, but will distract you from it (which is all you can hope for, I think).
B004LWZW7Y|5.0|Purchased for my niece and she loves it!  She must watch it at least once a day or her day isn't complete.
B005WMADYE|5.0|This movie gave me pretty much everything I expected of it. It's wild and has some of the most gorgeous art I've seen in an anime. My biggest complaint is that there isn't more of it. I'd have watched a 3 hour director's cut of this or, better yet, a series.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I love evernote. The app is very friendly and use is the best.<br />Evernote capture websites, emails, ideas so you have more urgent always achievable.
B00E0MCYPS|3.0|I'm not real good with driving games on my flyer (or even on the computer, really) so I can't say this is a great game.  A bit difficult to steer and you have literally no traction in grass.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Great book! Our service men and women sacrifice so much for our country. The majority of the proceeds is suppose to go to charities. I'm glad the book was written to correct details and I enjoyed how he talked about the POTUS.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|...and so am I.  Love the graphics and it is easy to control, though tough to play.  Very challenging game.
B007HU4FZ2|5.0|This movie was a real eye opener and shocked the world when it came out in 2004. This was a well directed movie by Mel Gibson. It was very graphic as far as the torture scenes and crucifixion scene. If you haven't watched this movie then I suggest you do. It is definitely an eye opener the Love Jesus had for us and the sacrifice he made to wash our sins.
B001CDLATE|5.0|This film is as stellar and touching as I remembered.  And the visuals are even more impressive on Blu-Ray enhancement than the original film I’ve seen.<br /><br />This is a must watch, and has scenes that will invigorate you, and tear your heart to pieces.
B009NY43NY|5.0|I liked the way Ms Harris closed out the series.  Finally Sam and Sookie are together.  I'm going miss Sookie!
B0091WNK8M|5.0|The Goonies is a fun movie and made in Astoria, Oregon! Good for the whole family. Holds up over time.
B0036S4B6M|5.0|Piper Kerman's memoir is a seemingly honest, yet exciting, account of her experience in the prison system. Her prose is a pleasure to read.
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|My daughter loved it and I teared up at the fatherhood moments. This is a great family movie, especially for a rainy day indoors.
B000F8O2OM|5.0|Really enjoy this series. Earliest seasons are the best. DVD quality is great with no issues. Can't wait to get into extras.
B008K6HN8I|3.0|The program is god but there is no way you can select root explorer,though it appears with an unchecked box against it. Another problem is in moving programs from one folder to other by using the cut and paste or copy and paste command. Otherwise the product is fairly good.
B000VWE5OY|5.0|This is an awesome show. It's funny, interesting and you never know what's gonna happen next! If you like a tv show that doesn't take itself too seriously then this is one for you.
B00E0MCYPS|4.0|It is easy to use for the kids and improves both concentration and the ability to control impulses. So a good little application that works fine.
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|For me Neil Gaiman has become the next Ray Bradbury and this newest book continues to prove me right.  With shades of &#34;Something Wicked This Way Comes,&#34;  he deftly spins a tale of youth's first brushing with the unknowable future and the immensity of life itself.  The lean page count also keeps it moving at a brisk pace, which leaves nothing for this reader to complain about.
B008LH4YYC|3.0|It is alright but not a great program. Most of the tasks can be done within the kindle settings temselves, so in a way superfluous.
B00CL6HGIK|1.0|I Couldn't even finish it. Weak performances from Russell Crowe, Mark Wahlberg and Catherine Zeta Jones. Totally unbelievable. Very dissappointing.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Amazing series!  Just love it!  Very sad season though; hope that isn't spoiling anything by saying that!  Looking forward to Season 4!
B00EY8A6BC|5.0|I enjoyed trying to figure out how the &#34;magic&#34; worked, what they were doing, how it was being done.  It was exciting and a fun ride.
0375869026|5.0|My son (5th grade) could not put this book down and said that he did not want it to end. High praise from a rather reluctant reader!
B004MYFV0O|5.0|Love it! It really makes you feel able to draw, even if you deeply believe you can't. Very easy to follow. In just 20 minutes each day you can start learning the basics of drawing in perspective.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game is so awesome I can't stop playing it. You should get the game . You can build any thing.
1937909514|5.0|I loved this book and the series.  I am a Josh Lanyon fan for life now.  Sad that this is the last one in the series.
B00AS88FKG|5.0|ACTUALLY I BOUGHT THIS MOVIE FOR MY SON , I MAILED IT TO MISSOURI  , HE LOVES IT HE IS A BATMAN FAN
B007SGLZP8|5.0|I hadn't read John Grisham in a little while although I do enjoy his works.  The Racketeer did not disappoint.  It held my interest all the way through and was well written.  Great ending.
B004GHNIRK|4.0|Never have I been exposed to absolute poverty as in this book .  I wanted to lay it aside, and many times I did.  It was almost too much to bear.  I finished it.  I wish I knew French, the phrases would have meant more.  I also felt a strain at the wordiness of the book, it was quite a challenge , our English isn't what it used to be these days.  The love story itself was precious.  A time when people fell  in love; with all the joy and  events that lead to Holy Matrimony.
B004CURZFC|4.0|Cute movie! May be a little too low-key or serious for toddlers. It's better for older kids and pre-teens. Great for the price!
1931559317|4.0|Excellent sky chart.  Have seen many, but not as good as this Atlas.  It`s not just a book of cheap paper drawings.  It is a super quality Atlas that is needed by everyone interested in Astronomy.  If it`s a pocket edition, then it`s made for LARGE CARGO PANTS with BIG POCKETS.
B0036S4B6M|4.0|An interesting look &#34;from the inside&#34;. soem details about the very separate &#34;us and them&#34; culture that pervades. Exposes the sad state of affairs when the punishment part is big and rehabilitations is so low. Not the same as the TV show, but clearly has the elements that were expanded to make for entertainment.
0345529057|5.0|These are really good books. I've bought them all, and I eagerly look forward to the next book, The Winds of Winter.
B002VXGW2E|5.0|Having read Julia Child's autobiography [[ASIN:0307277690 My Life in France]] and having thoroughly enjoyed it as much or more than most novels, it was a delight to see parts of Child's autobiography come to life in this charming movie.  Merryl Streep captures Julia's warmhearted and intelligent essence.  Amy Adams plays the younger Julie with panache.  It was fun to see the two lives in parallel as the younger Julie attempts to cook through Julia Child's cookbook.  Stan Tucci as Paul Child was brilliant, too.  I especially enjoyed seeing how Child created her own cooking school in Paris. A lovely movie which I could see more than once. 4.5 stars.
B005MLOKXA|5.0|This show is very good .  We enjoy watching it and have seen all seasons shows.  The have developed the characters exemely well.<br />The story line is very interesting and holds our interest.  The family is portrayed as a dysfunctioning unit but does have some values.<br />They seem to be like real people in todays society.
B00D6BN9NK|3.0|But this one was a little weak. Lots of action and some twists, but wish there had been more dialog.
B0063IH60K|4.0|It's a habit-forming game and fun to challenge. The only complaint I have is that the same card numbers seem to come up frequently - 3 fours up and then draw another four etc. This seems to happen more often than playing with cards.
B00ECU34ZM|5.0|Beautifully done. SciFi with great gadgets, but not overdone. The plot is wonderful and totally took me by surprise. Recommend for any scifi fan.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Best of the three books! I really hope that they make a movie on this as well. I could read this one over and over
B0071WQ7WU|5.0|Production is EXCELLENT. Tremendous lyrics. Not as many heavy songs as usual, but I find it to be a very powerful album about life.
B000VX4X0Y|1.0|My anticipation has being marred by the defective shoe Amazon sent to me. It is an eye sore there one of the lace eyelet are dropping out and deformed, with the leather beside badly chipped. I can show a photo here as evident. It looks like someone had used a sharp object to dig the eyelet out, where it becomes deformed and is pretty sharp.<br /><br />The pair of shoes is probably a returned item or mishandled by the staff, yet they send it to me knowing that I am an overseas buyer using forwarding service. I dont believe Timberland has got no Quality Control on their products. I actually used some discount coupons for the purchase which further brought down my paying price. Now, with this eye sore, it gonna cost me $91 to get a refund since I have to send from abroad, or it gonna cost me $119 for a replacement. Totally waste of my money.<br /><br />Brakdown of my delivery cost for either refund or replacement:<br />- It costed me $28 to have the item forwarded to me which I already paid.<br />- It will cost me $63 to send the defective item back to Amazon.<br /><br />For refund - $28+$63 = $91<br />For replacement - $28+$63+$28 = $119<br /><br />Amazon customer service actually offered to partial refund me $18 which is 25% of $72, the sale price I got, and I have yet to accept the partial refund. The customer service suggested getting them to repair it locally but stop short of saying who will foot the bill for repair. Or do they means $18 for repair? If it can be repaied but cost alot more, who will foot the bill? I cannot fathom how this suggestion can be made since when can you patch back a chip off on the leather, probably about 5mm in size and depth of 1-2mm? I hope they are not thinking of patching it like what you do for welding metal or soldering.<br /><br />Honestly, what good does it make for an eye sore especially when you will be kept reminded how you are high handedly managed by some big company?<br /><br />So buyers from aborad, please be warned and I have a few friends who have similar complains. By the way, these shoes are Made in Haiti. Also, as the customer service is out-sourced to India, you have a variety of support level coming from them, while half can be pretty nonchalent to your issue, some do make an attempt to read what you are saying. I always sense that they do not quite understand what I was writing, and it usually takes a few emails before someone can actually understand the issue cause I have to repeat and bring them to the main points repeatedly. And now Amazon customer service has stopped responding and it shows how high handed approach they take toward their customer.have a few friends who have similar complains.

B00AMBLXP8|1.0|Other than a few funny scenes I found this to be a very stupid movie. I say that, but I know plenty of GUYS who REALLY like it.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I'm generally not a fan of period pieces, but I am utterly hooked on Downton Abbey. I love the characters.
B0043VDIAG|5.0|One of the best books I ever read, makes you forget about what is happening around you. Make sure you don't miss out. Sparks style of writing is refreshing and fascinating.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|I did things in the &#34;wrong&#34; order, I watched three seasons of the show before touching a book from this series but I think that works. They really do complement each other and of course, after reading a book or two I went back and indulged in a little Varys and Dany visually. I have now read all 5 books and am in awe of the way the whole saga and whole universe it inhabits hang together and have such depth and vibrancy. One should read the books emphatically as the TV shows cannot and do not explain all the nuances that you need to know to make sense of it all. In addition : the way the chapters focus on the players in turn works out really well, complements and again is better than the linear TV experience
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|The story seemed too rushed. Like there was too much to get through in just one book. She should have written two books and put more effort into them.
B00BFUUMO8|4.0|only problem for me is the freezing. I used to think it was my kindle yet it would not freeze while playing/ using another app. I visit my dinosaurs any chance I get. The graphics are awesome and I love playing!
B009ZQC7MY|4.0|Would have given 5 stars but for the season ending last scene.  Love the series and wish it would never end.
B00EVLU2F2|4.0|It seems there are two versions of British duo Goldfrapp: the glammy electro-pop one, and the one that specialize in laid-back, hazy dreaminess. 'Tales of Us' definitely falls into the latter category, with an overall vibe that's reminiscent of the pastoral folk of 2008′s 'Seventh Tree,' only darker and more dramatic, resulting in a cinematic sound that's both beautiful and sinister-sounding.<br /><br />Opener \\"Jo\\" provides the general template: languidly strummed acoustic guitars, ethereal background atmospherics, and minimal percussion, with Alison Goldfrapp's sensual vocals acting as a focal point to the moody ambiance. Continuing in this vein is first single \\"Annabel\\", a gorgeous, deceptively simple song with spare instrumentation and moving lyrics dealing with gender identity. It's a rather emotionally stirring listen, and one of the strongest tracks here.<br /><br />Most of the songs have haunting undercurrents, as heard on \\"Drew\\" and \\"Simone\\", both of which feature dreamy, blissful acoustic soundscapes that are underscored with eerie strings and piano. The combination of beauty and freaky on these tracks and others create some conflicting emotions within the listener, where one is never quite sure whether to be scared or just drift away to a relaxed, serene state. \\"David Lynch-ian\\" is an overused adjective when describing music, but it suits this album perfectly.<br /><br />\\"Thea\\" is the only song that really busts out of the calm waters, with its slowly thumping electronic dance beat backing layered vocal tracks that intertwine with the synths beautifully. It's a fine song that provides a nice change of pace, even though it doesn't quite fit in with the rest of 'Tales of Us,' an album whose strength lies in its ability to transport the listener not to the dance floor, but into a narcotic, hypnotized state.<br /><br />It's also an album in which the sum is greater than its parts, meaning it works better when listened to as a whole, as if it were a film. Each song builds off the previous one, to the point that the quiet beauty of string-laden closer \\"Clay\\" feels like it's almost soaring after the gloominess of all that came before. Taken individually, there are only a few standout tracks here. Collectively, they're nearly all standouts.<br /><br />(Originally written by me for Earbuddy.net)
B000FC1JCQ|5.0|well written, covers the legendary story of king arthur from the women's point of view.  also includes ancient matriarchal culture and nature and goddess-based spirituality.  Read it years ago, but enjoying it much more the 2nd time.
B0083SBMBM|5.0|Got this for my niece for Christmas.  Perfect for the Hemsworth fan.  It will bring her lots of joy!! Arrived in great condition.
B004SD5GZ4|5.0|I like the fact that I down load it , fast and is available every time I need it ...love it!!!!<br />I strongly suggest it ....
B004QXJZXA|5.0|Even though it appears dated by today's standards, it is a great movie.  You can't beat the realism of this film, it's like you are really there in the race.  And it's Steve McQueen!
B005DJREGQ|4.0|It portrays the very common life of a teen. And how unprepared parents are to give guidance or norms, (moral would be better) . It is very enticing for a teen, I watched as a mom! and now I can discuss how to prevent certain situations.<br />It is encouraging to see how easy is to be popular, or not. Start liking yourself, and that will shine around you.
B000MRAAJM|5.0|This film is brilliant and captivating. I shows the true beauty of Earth and the unstoppable force that is nature.
B00AZMFJYA|1.0|...this DVD is so bare-bones it could be on display at the museum of natural history.<br /><br />Remember when the first JJ Abrams TREK was released in a special edition DVD with a disc full of extras in a case shaped like the Enterprise?<br /><br />THAT? That was AWESOME.<br /><br />This one? Not so much.<br /><br />There should be a sticker on the case that says \\"Hey...you're lucky the MOVIE is on the disc\\".<br /><br />Movie is four stars, folks...FOUR. STARS.<br /><br />The DVD is a sad unfortunate one.
B00CRWJ5GO|1.0|Too lame to even finish watching. There's only so long you can watch a bunch of characters you've never develop any emotional connection to, in the hope that eventually the disjointed and seemingly random sub-plots will be unified.
