B0043X1FOK|4.0|Fisher Stevens and Michael McKean star in this 1988 comedy sequel.  Robot, Johnny 5 visits his friend in New York and tries to stop  jewel thieves. This is a pretty good sequel and I remember  when it used to be on tv long ago. This dvd has decent  picture and sound, but only a making-of featurette.  I recommend this.
B002B55XGI|5.0|This book was a wonderful tribute to the Navy Seals. They are a group of men who are devoted to their country and to each other. These men gave up their lives to uphold the honor of the United States. I could not put the book down. My heart ached when I read of their decision to put honor before their own safety. These wonderful men all deserve our gratitude, support and love.    Shirley Bell  TX

B004WOS3P4|5.0|This is one CD that with more than a few listens, you end up liking a lot (or in my case all) of the tracks. A few of them I wasn't crazy about for a while but they grew on me. My favorite tracks, in order are: GOODBYE TO THE GIRL (vulnerable rock ballad), WE BELIEVE (David's surefire anthem. Feels like a perfect song for the troops to get motivated to.), RAPID EYE MOVEMENT (emotional and relate-able), RIGHT HERE, WITH YOU (just a great love song) & 4 LETTER WORD (a bit vibe-y and great guitars that you could almost dance to). Another track that I love is TAKE ME AS I AM. The bridge actually reminds me quite a bit of the vibe that Aerosmith's song DON'T WANNA MISS A THING gave off for some reason.<br /><br />David wraps his husky, forceful vocal instrument around all of these songs and they come alive. It is said on his artist's bio here that it took around 3x the length of time put into this album than he did for his last. I think it shows.<br /><br />If you would have asked me before this record's release if I had been waiting for it for months on end, I would have said no. I was more a fan of his voice than his songs when he came out. However, I'm glad that I pretty much pre-ordered it on a whim days before its release date. I didn't think he had this in him but what a great album. I ordered his first album 2 days ago and will hopefully get it soon. If it's half as good as this record, then I'm definitely in for a treat.<br /><br />Great job, Mr. Cook. I hope you have a great upcoming tour and can only hope to see you live at least once before I die. You now have a fan in me.<br /><br />4.5 stars (or an 9/10).<br /><br />DOWNLOAD:<br />\\"Goodbye To The Girl\\"<br />\\"We Believe\\"<br />\\"Rapid Eye Movement\\"<br />\\"Right Here, With You\\" &<br />\\"4 Letter Word\\"
0393325172|4.0|While it may seem ridiculous to add another positive review to the already overwhelming number of others, I still wanted to add a short endorsement of Patrick O'Brien's 'Master and Commander', and to possibly nudge those still on the fence about attempting this series to give it a try.  I personally had waited this long because, even though I had enjoyed the film, the subject matter - coupled with O'Brien's reputation as an un-condescending writer - didn't encourage me to pursue it any further.  It wasn't until after reading several enthusiastic comments about the series in general from a reviewer friend, and then, fast on the heels of that, finding a used copy at a local Goodwill, that I decided to try it myself.    'Master and Commander' is the first in a series of twenty novels following the adventures of the British Naval officer Jack Aubrey and Ship's Surgeon Stephen Maturin, and though this installment must, as a matter of course, spend time introducing us to the characters and the world they inhabit, O'Brien glides seamlessly into a storyline that fleshes out the cast and immerses the reader into life at sea in the first decade of the nineteenth century.  Immersion is the key word - other than a few brief passages where Stephen Maturin, himself new to the service, has some finer points explained to him by a young crewman, O'Brien spends little time on the details of Naval life, expecting the reader to catch on as he goes along.  Nor does he waste words on his people either, preferring to showcase their qualities as a consequence of the action around them.      This is intelligent fiction - probably some of the most challenging entertainment I've read.  I found it convenient to read it while next to the computer, and kept both Wikipedia and an online dictionary queued up, as well as Google translator for the odd foreign phrase I couldn't make out.  None of that is absolutely necessary, of course - I would have gotten the gist of the story without the aides, but together with the book, I must admit I learned more than I would have expected.  Readers who are not looking for something to challenge them will probably be disappointed in O'Brien - and also those looking for 'fast-paced' novels.  Those accustomed to the hyperkinetic action of contemporary general fiction are likely to find 'Master and Commander' unbearably slow.  From my perspective though, it was a style perfectly suited to my taste, and I look forward to the next chapter.
0425220931|5.0|I read this book and it instantly opened my mind. You don't have to be a musician to grasp the ideas and life lessons that are being put forth if you are ready to accept them. Music is alive and Life is Music. Also the craziest thing and after you the read the book you will understand the signifigance... My friend (who plays the trombone and is getting his master degree in music) told me I had to read this book and he told me how his Mom found it at a yard sale, she is highly religious and thought it would get my friend more in touch with his christian side based on the title. She didn't even know we enjoyed Victor Wooten and had seen him in concert but she was drawn to it...passed it on to him and now I am passing it on to everyone I care about it. I hope you do too!
0061914177|5.0|This book is awesome! I could not put it down once I started to read it. I'm reading it for the second time. I took a short class on social media, but it did not make sense until now.

1442419814|3.0|First, let me say that I wasn't real excited about his book and it took me quite a while to get into it. I just found most of it rather boring. But the second half picked up and by the end I was seriously glad I had the second book!<br />Tally lives in a futuristic world where people are born ugly. Once you turn sixteen you receive and operation to make you \\"pretty\\" and will then reside in New Pretty Town where the only thing that happens are non-stop parties. The Pretties care about nothing other than their parties and their looks and can even add upgrades. Her best friend Peris has already had his surgery and she can't wait to be with him again.<br />Shortly before Tally's sixteenth birthday, she meets Shay. Shay has different feeling towards the Pretties. She has no interest in becoming one and Tally learns she is planning to run away and join a group of Uglies called The Smoke. When it becomes clear to Shay that Tally is not going, she leaves some cryptic directions for her if she changes her mind.<br />On the day of Tally's surgery, everything goes wrong. Instead she is taken to \\"Special Circumstances\\" where she is told she will not be able to have her surgery until she finds Shay and transmits the location of The Smokes.<br />When she finally arrives, she learns information that is not made public concerning the surgery to become pretty and its side effect. She meets David who has lived this way his whole life and does not understand why anyone would want to have surgery to become pretty. He is able to see past looks and place more emphasis on the person themselves.<br />After a tragic accident changes everything for The Smokes, Tally will make a sacrifice in order to save the current and soon to be residents of New Pretty Town while protecting The Smokes.<br />By the time I got to the end of this book, I was absolutely hooked! I started the second book \\"The Pretties\\" right away and will have a review up soon.<br />I have to say that the series is definitely worth trudging through the first half of this book. I would have given this first book a higher rating because it got totally addicting at the end, but there were soooo many boring parts in the first half. I really, really like this series and think everyone should check it out!<br />Reviews for books 2 and 3 are coming soon!e first half of this book.

0553801473|2.0|Let me start by saying that like many people I love Martin's books. I chose to rate this book lower than a feast of crows (gave that one 3 stars).<br /><br />SPOILERS- DO NOT READ FURTHER IF YOU HAVE NOT READ THE BOOK<br /><br />A list of reasons why it frustrated me are outlined below<br /><br />1) Pointless characters- we follow this Dornish prince just to see him die. Complexity of story does not require the story to have meaningless characters. We know nothing about this Aegon Targaryen, yet he is supposed to be probably the single most character introduced in this book.<br /><br />2)Character regression- Jon snow is badass for the first couple of chapters (Janos Slynt can attest to that), and then he starts to become really boring. You don't see any fighting with the undead, but you see Jon worried about groceries. This is particularly disappointing since he is one of my favorite characters. Tyrion does nothing. Daenerys does nothing. I don't think Daenerys has the blood of the dragon. She probably got a transfusion from Bella Swan of twilight. Her character used to be one of my favorites, now she is a cardboard cutout.<br /><br />3) Deaths- yeah people die for no reason. Jon is murdered cuz Martin didn't know what else to do with him. He is most likely not dead to be honest (the red witch will probably french him or something to bring him back to life).<br /><br />4) Laundry list- If the devil is in the details then this book is hell-spawn. I would sometimes start a paragraph and then after reading it realize there was no point to it. It would describe a ship or a list of banners or Martin's favorite i.e. stupid foods (dog tail soup roasted in locust semen, cowhide jerky etc.)<br /><br />5) Plot- Nothing happens, plot development and character development take a back seat to pointless descriptions of the environments. The first 75% of the book could be cut down to 200-300 pages. None of the cool plots we wanted to know from the 3rd book actually get fleshed our meaningfully. I wanted a lot of things to happen like tyrion meeting Daenerys, Jon's parents etc.<br /><br />6) Meereenese knot my a**<br /><br />If this book was written by any other author, I would be satisfied. But Mr Martin, you are capable of so much more than this book. The closest thing I can compare this series to is crack, with Mr Martin being the crack dealer. He gives us the good stuff in the first three books to get us hooked, then he gives us the adulterated/diluted stuff afterwards since he knows we have no choice but to keep buying. I am going to keep buying these stupid books no matter how bad they get because I am emotionally invested in a lot of these characters. That doesn't mean that I can't b**** about it.<br />Final rating: 2/5

B004HO6I4W|4.0|My kids loved the movie so much I bought the BD for them to play it all day... my surprise? Spanish language on the movie is \\"Mexican\\" version and no \\"neutral\\" version, I am not Mexican, I don't live in Mexico and even though I have nothing against Mexico I don't like their slang and I think Fox messed up releasing this movie without spanish neutral version.
B0021L8V1Q|3.0|It was that bad, honestly.  It was a little heavy on the villians and War Machine deserved a bigger part.  Isn't he a giant part of the story anyway?  Overall, it was a really good film and the possibility of Iron Man 3 is a great idea.
B004QK5N5W|2.0|Unfortunately, if you are looking for an adapter to show your iPad 2 full-screen on a 1080p HDTV, you need to expect some black bars to the left and right. The bars disappear when watching movies or Netflix. If you want to use the setup to browse the web together with someone else or remote into another Mac/PC to stream content (e.g. splashremote, VNC), you need to live with the bars left and right.     At least I did not find the setting removing the bars and \\"stretch\\" the iPad resolution to fit the screen. I hope the new iOS 5 \\"Mirroring\\" will work better.    Besides that, the adapter does its job (incl. charging the iPad).
159102594X|2.0|Expected to love this book, but instead found it to be tedious.

B004YXE438|1.0|Using Samsung Galaxy S, game frequently entered Pause mode.  Then when the picture was complete it wouldn't recognize the accomplishment.  The game would not save progress, but instead returned to an earlier version.  Poor settings selections (can't turn off the introductory music).  Poor menu selections (since when does \\"new game\\" indicate returning to a previously saved game).  The game itself was intriguing, but the programming needs a lot of work.

B000FGGE7C|2.0|This movie is a disappointment.  Never fully explains itself or the universe it is set in leaving the viewer wondering what the hell the movie is about for the very beginning.  The actions scenes look good but again you are never really understand the context or why they are happening besides chasing down the heroine in the story.  The movie introduces plot points and characters and then  never finishes the plot or explains who a character is.  The look of the movie is good but the script and plot are terrible.
B004LWZW4M|5.0|For some reason, I've always been attracted to the \\"Planet of the Apes\\" Series\\" and this one is probably the best.  The special effects are outstanding, John Lithgow is touching, and I found myself really rooting for \\"My Main Simian !\\" (Ceasar).  Even if you are partial to more mature and \\"artsy\\" films, this one will, without a doubt, provide you with a lot of fun and food for thought. I saw it on opening weekend in mid-afternoon at the local cineplex, and the place was jammed tight.  I don't think anyone was disappointed.  Oh--and don't dare get up to leave while the end credits are running!
0553801473|5.0|An excellent sequel to A Feast For Crows.  I can certainly understand why GRRM had to split the narratives.  However, did it really take that many years to get there?<br /><br />Many fans of the \\"A Song of Ice and Fire\\" series are also fans of Robert Jordan's \\"Wheel of Time\\" series, I am sure.  And if may be presume to speak for all of us, we sincerely hope that Mr. Martin will FINISH THE SERIES FIRST, before anything unfortunate happens...as was the case with the late Mr. Jordan.  While we're VERY glad to see the HBO series, we want to make sure the whole series is available so your estate doesn't have to hire someone to finish the job for you!<br /><br />Anyway, glad to finally have the book!  Nice job with moving the characters around, and the plotlines forward!
1569242739|5.0|I adore cupcakes, they have to be my favorite dessert in the world.  They are the perfect amount of cake serving as the perfect utensil from which to eat frosting, icing, mousse, or ganache.  I also have very high standards for cupcakes because I adore them so much.  I have to say these cupcakes and frostings are absolutely amazing.  I have made about half of the recipes in this book and my family and coworkers (none of which are vegan) are starting to think of me as \\"the cupcake lady\\" and they routinely request that I make more cupcakes to share with them.  Every recipe I have made results in a moist cake with a tender crumb and a frosting that is just the right amount of sweet without being too \\"sugary\\".      The one cake that wasn't quite as good as the others was the low fat vanilla cupcake.  HOWEVER, when you top it with the jam, fresh raspberries, and drizzle of icing that is recommended they too became amazing.  The fresh fruit really made that cupcake so don't skip it when you try that recipe.    Favorites include:  pumpkin chocolate chip cupcakes with cinnamon icing, chocolate cupcakes with chocolate buttercream (I had many comments from people that the frosting was one of the best they have ever had), red velvet with the cream cheese frosting variation (I used Tofutti brand cream cheeze), chocolate mint cupcakes, and the coconut lime cupcakes.

0811879542|5.0|My sister is a librarian and brought out this interesting book for the weekend while we were camping with a grandchild. She said the kids in the library were agog with giggles and delightful cheers and clapping when reading this book.   Wellllllll the grandson, just turned 3, LOVED LOVED LOVED IT!   We had to go through the book over and over again.  He was quite sad on Sunday when it had to be returned to the library on Monday morning.      I ordered four of them just now, so I can give one to each of my three grandkids, and keep one here at my house for myself!     In this day and age of computer games, iphones with games, and the incessant need for things to go beep beep booop boop, it is refreshing to see a basic paper page in a book spark such imagination, delight and creativity!

The characters are adorable, and the book takes place in Paris... Who doesn't want to read about that?

B003ZZAXFO|5.0|Peter Gabriel's third self-titled album, i.e. the one with his face melting on the cover, is one of the greatest albums of all time.  From start to finish it is an incredible effort, with most of the lyrics from the point of view of someone with a disturbed perspective.  The album was originally released on May 30th of 1980, and it remains one of the great Progressive rock albums of all time.  Featuring greats like Robert Fripp, Kate Bush, Tony Levin, Phil Collins, and a host of others, the album has a firm musical base on which to build these extraordinary songs.    The album opens with \\"Intruder\\" a song sung from the perspective of a burglar, but not just a burglar, but one who gets a thrill from scaring those he is burgling.  Next up is \\"No Self Control\\", which not surprisingly is sung from the perspective of one who lacks self-control in a number of areas and to an alarming degree.  \\"Start\\" is a short instrumental which leads into \\"I Don't Remember\\" sung from the perspective of someone with amnesia who is trying desperately to remember.  Next up is \\"Family Snapshot\\", a song sung from the point of view of an assassin.  It was inspired by \\"An Assassin's Diary\\" written by the man who tried to assassinate George Wallace, but Gabriel uses images from JFK's assassination in the song.  Closing out the first half of the album is \\"And Through the Wire\\" which is a bit more difficult to figure out, but a good song nevertheless.  There are a lot of possible meanings for the song, but I have never figured out exactly what it means.  The singer seems to be obsessed with someone, and perhaps stalking them through various methods, or perhaps it is merely someone he is unable to be with physically due to borders.    The second half opens with \\"Games Without Frontiers\\", a wonderful song which compares the ridiculous nationalistic contests as they took place on a couple of game shows (Jeux Sans Frontières - France and It's a Knockout - UK) with more the more series and still ridiculous contests between nations in the form of war. \\"Not One of Us\\" is next and deals with prejudice.  Next up is \\"Lead a Normal Life\\" which is mostly an instrumental other than a short passage which invokes the image of one living under restrictions being told to lead a normal life.  Last up is the superb \\"Biko\\" which is about the killing of Steven Biko, the anti-apartheid activist who died in custody from wounds he received during the interrogation.    Peter Gabriel's first two albums were well received, but this third album took things to a much higher level, and it set the stage for his next album which is right up there with this one in terms of quality.  This is an album which is strong both in music as well as in lyric.  No doubt this is a 5-star effort.

1451629184|5.0|It's hard to know what to say after reading A Stolen Life by Jaycee Dugard.  The first thing I noticed is that she is a very good and honest writer, and even in her journal she kept about her cat as a child, she expressed herself very well.  Her writing is clear, and left me with no doubt about what she meant to say and how she felt.    Being taken captive at eleven years old must be a terrible thing, and that terror and aloneness comes through as Jaycee describes her first days and nights with Phillip Garrido. A week in a situation like hers with a mentally deranged man and his complacent wife would be enough to harden the heart of a much older person, but for Jaycee Dugard, it was eighteen years of it and she came out of it with sound mind and a will to have a bright future for herself and her children.      After reading her story, finding out what she went through for all those years, the knowledge that she has so many people who love her and her children and who are helping her to learn to live a normal life again is such a happy thing to hear.  One of the nicest parts of the book after her rescue was when she called her childhood friends and reunited with them again, because she thought about them so much while in captivity.      While this was a very anger-inducing subject to read about, this book kept me reading and was very hard to put down, because I wanted to get to Jaycee's rescue.  I had forgotten the series of events that had led to her freedom.  It's a story and a book that won't easily be forgotten.

1932100660|5.0|The China Study<br />by T. Colin Campbell, PhD<br /><br />On the morning of July 25, 2011, our travel group boarded a bus from Prague to Krakow--an eight-hour ride that enabled me to bring out my Kindle, which always accompanies me on my travels. To my astonishment, my book list included The China Study by Colin Campbell, PhD, which I assumed and later confirmed came as an unexpected gift from my computer maven son, Don jr.  And what a gift it proved to be!!!<br /><br />As I read this book on diet I realized, having just turned 80, how lucky I was to be alive and in reasonably good health! Dr. Campbell, with completely convincing data gleaned by him, his researchers, and other distinguished investigators over decades, discloses how the American diet has done much to destroy our health.<br /><br />As the battle for expanded health care rages (to repeal present legislation or not to repeal), this author has inadvertently offered a potential way to keep us from spending over 30 percent of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) on health care in 20 years (as opposed to over 15 percent now)--by simply changing how we eat. Of course, as he notes in this seminal book, we citizens will have to fight the political power that the animal product food producers and the drug companies use to issue misleading information on what constitutes good dietary practice.<br /><br />The myths he attacks have accompanied me all through my life. What are they? In a nutshell, since my earliest days my parents stressed the importance of protein obtained mainly from animal sources--meat, eggs, and milk--as the key to strong bones and longevity. It turns out that the corporate entities that sell these products have strong motivation not to reveal, as Campbell eloquently does, the dangers of our levels of ingestion. More shockingly, he counsels us to become vegetarians!<br /><br />I believe you will find Campbell's experience in trying to forward his diet ideas to colleagues and the public in general most informative. It's no surprise that so-called scientific research has often been used to protect corporate or ideological interest to the detriment of the public good. He cites the tobacco industry's divisive studies to delay the release of information about the dangers of smoking; the producers of animal products have hired well-known scientists to do the same research--delaying, denying, and denigrating the impeccable science put forward by many real scientists over the decades.<br /><br />Be sure to read about his treatment by his superiors at the NAS, where Campbell worked on the first such report on nutrition and cancer, which was released in 1982. It engendered huge interest and acclaim, \\"establishing high-profile goals for the dietary prevention of cancer,\\" including cutting fat intake, and encouraging increased consumption of fruits, vegetables, and whole-grain cereal products.<br /><br />This report drew quick response from the Council on Agricultural Science and Technology (CAST), an influential lobbying group for the livestock-based farming industry, which produced a report summarizing the views of 56 experts who were concerned about the effect this landmark NAS report would have on the agriculture and food industries. Other Campbell foes weighed in, and a challenging report was quickly sent to all 535 members of Congress by the American Meat Institute (AMI), National Broiler Council (NBC), National Cattlemen's Association (NCA), National Livestock and Meat Board, National Meat Association, National Milk Producers Federation, National Pork Producers Council, National Turkey Federation, and National Egg Producers. All, of course, were only concerned about the public's health!<br /><br />Campbell's enemies founded a new organization called the American Council on Science and Health (ACSH), headquartered in New York City. The organization still bills itself today as \\"a consumer education consortium concerned with issues related to food, nutrition, chemicals,pharmaceuticals, lifestyle, the environment and health.\\" It also claims to be an \\"independent non-profit tax-exempt organization,\\" but it receives 70 percent of its funding from corporate donors, according to the National Environment Trust (NET), which cites the Congressional Quarterly's Public Interest Profiles.<br /><br />The NET reports that the ACSH has claimed in their publications that cholesterol is not related to coronary disease! And further, they claim that \\"the unpopularity of food irradiation...is not based on science,\\" and that \\"endocrine disrupters\\" (e.g., PCBs, dioxin, etc.) are not a human health problem, saccharine is not carcinogenic, and fossil-fuel restrictions to control global warming should not be implemented.<br /><br />Campbell says that searching for a serious critique of the food industry is like searching for a needle in a haystack. \\"Although I believe that some of the ACSH's arguments may have merit, I seriously question their claim to be an objective broker of consumer education.\\"<br /><br />In the 1980s Campbell headed a new entity, the American Institute for Cancer Research (AICR) in Falls Church, Virginia. Among those who sought to discredit AICR was the pharmaceutical industry, which saw the diet approach as a huge threat. The American Cancer Society (ACS) was a particular detractor, not accepting until the 1990s the fact that diet and cancer are related. ACS was, of course, vested in the use of drugs, radiation and surgery. The president of ACS put out a memo saying that AICR was made up of quacks and felons.<br /><br />There are some people in very influential government and community positions who operate under the guise of being scientific experts, but whose real jobs are to stifle open and honest scientific debate. Perhaps they receive significant personal compensation for attending to the interests of powerful food and drug companies, or perhaps they merely have a corporate-friendly viewpoint. Personal bias is stronger than you might think.<br /><br />I know scientists who have lost family members to cancer; it angers them to entertain the possibility that personal choices, like diet, could have played a role in the death of their loved ones. Likewise, there are scientists for whom the high-fat, animal-based diet they eat every day is simply what they learned was healthy at a young age--they love the habit and they don't want to change.<br />Despite the fact that most scientists are honorable, the few who sell out to the highest bidder can have vast influence, creating vast confusion among the public.<br /><br />The data Campbell cites comes from countless prestigious sources--whose finding have been systematically dismissed by some of our highest authorities, including some associated with the National Academy of Sciences.<br /><br />Don't believe me? Just read the book. If you then can face a slab of raw cow meat or cover your cereal with cream, or even regular milk, you are willing to ignore real dangers that include increased chance of cancer, heart attack, Alzheimer's, and virtually every other disease our flesh is heir to.<br /><br />Furthermore, Campbell persuasively argues that adopting a plant-based diet will help retard these diseases, and even reverse their course. More important, however, are the sobering implications of his arguments. When Norman Borlaug invented \\"Miracle Rice,\\" he opined that he had given the world just one generation to get a handle on its population growth, since the production of beef and other animal products requires so much more energy and resources than production of plant-based products.<br /><br />Now, with population growth expected to hit 10 or 12 billion by 2100, it would seem that plant-based resource consumption would ease starvation and ill health. However, it would be foolish indeed to pretend that, if the rich nations cut their consumption of animal-based products, this 10 or 12 billion population could easily sustain itself.<br /><br />Infact, if our entire 320 million (by 2100, nearly one billion) population changed its habits, the effect of longevity and better health would still put resources under terrific strain.  At a US population of one billion, we are still only 10% of the total world population; world grain resources are under huge pressure now to feed only seven billion.<br /><br />As an active octogenarian, I plan to abide by Campbell's findings, seeking (as we all are) to find the elusive fountain of youth sought by Ponce de Leon and so many others over the ages. Longevity is only of value when accompanied by good or reasonable health!<br /><br />So what are the chances of wide adoption? Well, the fate of two pioneering MDs who quiet unsuccessfully tried to introduce these diet ideas into the Cleveland Clinic Hospital is not encouraging. However, the growing number of cases not permanently helped by many present medical treatments suggest that change could come.<br /><br />Certainly Campbell's book helps, as we watch our government stumble on every matter, greased by filthy lucre at every step.

0765365278|4.0|Very very slow and long start, but once pace begins to pick up it becomes a real page turner. Very detailed world and character buildup, which I personally like. Even though I don't find some of the main characters to be very interesting, Kaladin's story line more than makes up for the rest. Highly recommended.
B004YXE438|5.0|enjoy this game very much, my first review, very easy to very difficult. think everyone will enjoy this one. thanks
B0001US8FI|5.0|THE DOUBLE DISC SET IS GREAT. IT GIVES A LOT OF BACK GROUND INFORMATION FOR THE PERSON WHO WANTS TO KNOW MORE.
1439102724|5.0|Jodi Picoult did not disappoint with this novel. I love how she spoke from every angle of the issue rather than writing from one character's perspective. This book made me grit my teeth and sob (I'm talking waterfall of tears streaming down my face), howeve, it also made me laugh out loud and cheer.  I fell in love with these characters and I wish there would be a part two. GREAT JOB JODI PICOULT!
0762434279|1.0|this book is full of fluff.....the author rambles on and on about his personal tales, how he was selling jam when he was a child, etc, and then proceeds to give vague advice such as 'become financially educate' (how? do I just start reading anything related to finance?) , if you search through wikipedia or something you will see that Kiyosaky's is a bit more criticized than you'd think.specially the kind of person who will follow the advice of 'getting rid of negative people' as in the super-fluffy dvd 'The Secret'. I am sick of this kind of New-Agey-money-health-love thrash....
B000EULJLU|2.0|I nearly drove off the road fast-forwarding through what seemed like nothingness on several of Tools songs. I only like Vicarious and two other songs whose name I do not know. Overall, this album was bloated and annoying. Bloated because of the ridiculous glasses they give you. Gimmicky and cheap, I hope Tool never does this again. Also, the 3-d effects from the glasses against the cd art were not that impressive.  I have to be brutally honest and re-iterate my earlier issue: nothingness (or barely audible sound) before songs is not kool. It's LAME and ANNOYING especially when you are trying to drive to work and you just want to hear some damn tunes. I know they probably want to build up some kind of epic emotion within you but i'm just not attuned to that. Again, I think they are filling in where they dont have to exert as much and expect fans to love it. It's about as much of a ripoff as when you buy something and expect it to live up to its value. This album does NOT live up to the value of a truly good Tool album for it's filler content and child-ish packaging. Disappointed. I'll just burn the 3 songs I like onto CD and stop complaining.
B0000542D2|5.0|No one knows what it's like to be The Beatles like The Beatles. This movie is just another great example of a talented foursome that - in a mere 10 years - managed to change the face of music. MTV should really thank Richard Lester every day for their existence. He's the reason music videos exist, and this is early proof. The lads find themselves immersed in the obsession of England, but still manage to keep their humor (and their friendship) in tact. One of my favorite movies of all time, and not just because I'm a Beatles fan. All around well-made, funny and a great time for any movie night.
B004XISI4A|1.0|Like so many people, I loved the first three books and read them quickly. I could accept that some of the characters that I had identified with were killed because the plot continued to engage me,<br />This last book I struggled with - it seemed to spend all its time journeying to somewhere and did not have enough plot movement to engage me. The descriptions of a characters breakfast, the extent that they can piss, types of turtles can be accepted once but not repeatedly - I kept thinking that I had read all this before and so started skipping pages. I put the book down a third of the way through and after a week or two, forced myself to finish but was dissapointed. I had pre-ordered this book, I will not be reading the next.
B000007MVD|5.0|There's not much to say here: It's the Beatles and they are live. Fantastic covers, great originals and rarely-heard recordings (like \\"Some Other Guy\\") make this CD a must have for Beatles fans. I love the chatting in between songs, too. I wish music still sounded this good.
B004C4IKCU|5.0|I have owned every album elvis ever made and the 2 mentioned in this site are his best (except for King Creole soundtrack).  Then when they came availBLE IN BOXED SETS of cd's in the 80's and 90's, i had to have them.  they are still great.  i usually get tired of a cd or album after playing it 10 or 12 times, but i never tired of any of these songs and albums.  if you want to buy the best of elvis, this is the music for you!!!  When I got my first copy of Elvis is Back album in the 50's when i was a teenager, i wore it out playing it full blast over and over again.  IT DROVE MY POOR PARENTS CRAZY.  BUT THAT music has held up to be SOME OF THE BEST ever done by anyone.  The original elvis is back was so blusey; the drums at the end of one of the songs is fantastic.  i won't tell you which one so you will listen to see what i mean.  his version of Fever is the best.  it is so sexy and haunting.  if you don't buy this box set, then seek out the cd's individually.
159420229X|4.0|Good book concerning memory improvement and methods operating since ancient times. This splendid story twisted with science, philosophy, theory and history. But it is not only about memorization techniques and scientific studies. I liked the idea that memory and creativity are connected. Here is another really good book: [[ASIN:B004X2WZ2M Memo: The Easiest Way to Improve Your Memory]]<br />Foer's writing is pretty funny ,definitely well worth reading, interesting and quick.
B004EPYZZ8|5.0|My husband and I really liked this movie. It was such an inspirational story, and the acting was pretty good I thought (not to mention the scenery is awesome!). Sure, it had a little bit of cheesiness (most Christian films do), but still, you don't come by these kind of movies very often. It's completely clean and has a great message. It's a perfect family movie!
B004YEJGEO|5.0|I love how challenging some of the levels get. All in all, a great buy at 99 cents, as it provides over 100 unique levels, some of which take quite some time to figure out. Hours of fun, and when I finish it, I will probably find myself playing through it again.
B003L77GRO|5.0|i can't wait to get this season. i think this is a well written series, great job aritting and acting. i don't have show time so i sometimes go to my friends homes or i have to wait for the series. thank you again
1439190275|1.0|After reading this book, I read T. Colin Campbell's one-star review of it, then Campbell's The China Study, then Caldwell Esselstyn's Prevent and Reverse Heart Disease, then books by McDougall and Fuhrman.  I now suspect that the authors of this book, as well as Gary Taubes and other low carb fad diet gurus are just opportunists trying to cash in on the millions Robert Atkins made telling people what they wanted to hear.  Like those \\"debunkers\\" of global warming, they make seemingly credible points and cite seemingly credible studies, but when you read the responses of Campbell, Esselstyn, McDougall, Fuhrman and look at the big picture, it becomes impossible to believe in these low-carb, high fat diet myths any longer.      Try googling famous vegan athletes, then google famous low-carb or Atkins athletes.  Or just look how trim and healthy Campbell, Esselstyn and McDougall look in their old age and compare to pictures of Atkins before he died.  I've been on the whole-foods plant based diet for a month now, have lost ten pounds, and feel healthier than I have in a long time.  I know one can lose weight on the Atkins diet in the short run, but I don't think it can be sustained in good health for a lifetime.  If it could, there would be lots of famous Atkins/Low Carb athletes out there, no?
B004FGMDOQ|3.0|Ransom Riggs is actually a very good writer, whose narration is effortlessly engaging. The problem I had with it is that it feels like the first half of the book is much stronger than the latter, mainly due to the author's unfortunate decision to explain absolutely everything. I was glued to the first portion of the book when Jake didn't understand what was going on, when he was struggling with his memories, his guilt, maybe even his sanity... but the explanation we wind up getting is nowhere near as creepy as you might hope, and indeed feels like an adventure Harry Potter might have had in his early years. Jake is sat down and fed literally PAGES of exposition full of mystical terms and concepts that left me feeling like all the mystery and horror had been yanked away... the book might as well have just said \\"A wizard did it.\\"     The final confrontation was extremely dissatifying, owing largely to the fact that Jake has an extended dialogue with the bad guy that fails to really make the monsters seem scary at all after that point, the romance feels token and underdeveloped to the point where I was skeptical of how much Jake's new girlfriend professed to care for him over someone else in her past, and the ending makes it abundantly clear this is going to be a new series, with no real resolution, and I'm honestly not sure if I want to continue it. This book is like Harry Potter meets X-Men, then heavily diluted and chopped up, and nobody is more disappointed than I am. It's an entertaining read, but lacks enough bite to really engage adults like myself or even teens, and has what will probably be too much profanity and violence for kids. It's an awkward book that could have been a lot better, but is still worth a read for fans of the genre.
B0055SWM08|5.0|a really nice little app. visually and acoustically very appealing. a bargain at 99 cents.  I hope they keep updating it.
0553801473|1.0|Unlike the many readers who started this series and had to wait for years to read the next book, I bought and read the first 4 and only waited a month to read this one. I will not be waiting for nor purchasing any further books in this series.<br /><br />Mr. Martin put together an interesting cast of characters. He developed them quite well. I became vested in their stories. I feel like I have been betrayed by the author through the deaths of some of them. Every book loses characters through conflict, that's what makes the story more real and more interesting at times. However, manipulating the story line to make it seem that things are going one way, only to chop down the character instead, is something I feel is wrong.<br /><br />Throughout the series, the tenor of the books has become increasingly dark. Things have become more violent, sadistic and crude. I found that more and more disconcerting. It may be that Mr. Martin feels that this fits in better with today's society and its tastes. I hope not. I have been reading fantasy for almost 50 years. There is some really great stuff out there, but I'm done with Mr. Martin.
0788859544|5.0|I purchased this DVD The Litte Mermaid for my granddaughter.  My own girls loved this story and the only one I had was the VHS version.  It played but not very well.  We purchased this one and I am so glad that I did.  The quality was exceptional.  It arrived as stated and we had the best movie nite ever.  The songs were so inspiring that our little granddaughter sang to them, especially kiss the girl.  Highly recommended.
B003VANOFY|5.0|I was tired of spending $15-25 for lower quality headsets and having them break only after a few weeks of use. I was a little hesitant at first to spend so much for a single headset, but I'm so glad I did. I love the surround sound and the voice change effects cause quite the laugh. This product was everything it stated and more. The best investment I could have made.
B000VDDWDS|5.0|This is gonna be short and sweet.<br />Great movie, good blu ray conversion.<br /><br />Worth the money if you like military or naval history, or just a killer movie.
B004YXE438|1.0|Cool app but all the pics are unorganized. Took me hours to put them all in order. It should say &quot;some assembly required &quot; in the description!! Some ppl might not have the time to unscramble the pics.
B004EPYZUI|3.0|As special and uncommon as it looks like anything else, Sucker Punch is a great action movie and a very good window on what action can be when greatly mastered. Though, the movie really needs to be seen twice to be fully appreciated because even if its visual is astonishing and oustanding, the story part is really, really twisted and quite difficult to be understood the first time. And last but not least, the extended version, except for one sequence, really helps to fix the small details that lack in the theatrical version. A masterpiece but only to be seen for its action sequences and visual effects, nothing more.
B004I654WQ|5.0|Loved it! The animation was almost \\"live\\" quality, and the story was great. The actors were perfect for their parts. Paul Newman was actually a serious racer at one time. George Carlin as a hippie VW Micro bus. (Gonna miss those two), and the real story of the Hudson Hornet. Lots of fact woven into the story.
B004EPYZZI|5.0|What a beautiful movie!!! I watched last night and I was moved to tears!! Perhaps she was a 13 year teenager, but she have more willpower and faith than a lot of older adults on different walks of life! While some reviews here mention the \\"faith or christian crap\\", Bethany was never a \\"victim\\" of shark attack. While scare at first of being unable to surf again, she was never afraid to swim in the very waters where she was bitten before. She always talk about her faith and how it helped to overcome the attack and being a surf champion. The scene were was was a misionary in Thailand, after the 2003 tsunami, was very moving and has lots of insights...Bethany was a great example of compassion!!! You can watch movies or read about people who overcomed great obstacles: Rick Allen of the english band, Def Leppard loosed one arm on a car accident, but the CD \\"Hysteria\\", with Allen at the electronic drums, became one of the largest selling CD in Rock music hystory. Or perhaps Ludwig Van Beethoven(1770-1827), who became deaf at age 30 and struggled with poverty and depression, but composed wonderful pieces of music, not to mention The 9th Symphony's \\"Ode to Joy\\". Johann Sebastian Bach was blind at old age, but composed the Branderburg Concertos. Mahatma Gandhi nor the Dalai Lama, weren't christians and the list may go on and on, but a strong faith in something grater than us, molded the greatest achievements in human history. Bethany Hamilton is another beautiful example. I strongly recommend the movie to chistians, budists, atheists or muslims alike. We all are one!! While some discuss our differences, or make war because of religions, we should be together in what we have in common and it was mentioned largely in the movie: LOVE.
B003ZSJ212|1.0|Way too many changes from the original cut. I don't mind sprucing up the color, sound and little extras in the background, but these \\"special special special edition\\" version are like actors who have had 47 plastic surgeries and you cant tell its them anymore. When they include the original cuts, THEN I will give Lucasfilm my money. VHS FTW!
0316286850|5.0|I didn't buy this book on Amazon, but all the same, just wanted to say that this book is worth having.  I am a makeup artist and have had this book for many years now and still love looking through it.  He was a very talented makeup artist with a great team on his side.

B0043KK4N6|4.0|The Chrissy A and Cher songs are top notch, just like the movie.  A little disappointing that not all songs in the movie were not there, only ones will be Chrissy A and Cher, nothing else.    All in All - Happy with it.

0525422943|5.0|This is the sequel to the book, If I Stay.  I think you do need to read that book first in order to understand what is going on in this one.  It was a great sequel and wonderful to find out where Adam and Mia ended up in their lives.<br /><br />The whole book is told from Adam's point of view.  He is living in Los Angelos as the front man for Shooting Stars, which has now gone double platinum with their first album and is hugely popular.  Meanwhile Mia is out in New York City pursuing her degree at Juliard.  Adam's life has been shattered by Mia's abscence and as he dodges paparazzi and tries to have some semblence of a normal life he is left grasping at straws.  Then one night while in New York he stumbles across one of Mia's performances and decides to go watch her.  Will this one night finally give Mia and Adam some closure on all of the events that happened during the first book, If I Stay?<br /><br />This was a wonderful book.  Forman does an excellent job of dumping you right into the main charater's head so that you are absolutely tied up their emotions and thoughts.  It was wonderful to see things from Adam's perspective and to see how he was having to re-evalute his lifestyle.  The majority of the book is told in present day, but portions of the book go back to times while Mia was recovering from her surgery or times after Mia went to New York City.<br /><br />The book is heart-rending, but not as heart-rending as the first one.  I think I only found myself in tears once in this one :-)  I thought the characters acted more realistic than they did in the first book, they weren't so perfect.  The book is hard to put down and really propelled by the continuous question, why did Mia leave?<br /><br />This book tackles a lot of serious issues, although I didn't feel they were quite as serious and deep as the issues covered in If I Stay.  Adam struggles with his fame; he can never get any privacy and he always feels alone even though there are tons of people around him.<br /><br />The books ends fantastically and realistically.  I think readers will be pleased.  I really liked where it ended, but find myself hoping just a little bit that we can read more about Adam and Mia in the future.<br /><br />Overall an excellent sequel to If I Stay.  Readers who loved, If I Stay, need to check this out.  You get to find out what happens to Mia and Adam and how the events of If I Stay color their lives afterwards.stically and realistically.

0385341679|5.0|What happens when one of the most captivating series of the decade comes to an incredible conclusion?  Shadow Fever happens!!!  The Fever frenzy began in 2006 with Dark Fever, yet only ask any hardcore HighFer and you will soon learn that  the magical waters for the series run far deeper.  Karen Moning has taken us on any incredible journey, into a world that changes before our very eyes with each turn of the page.  One that left us breathless and yearning for more at the end of every single book. \\"Cliffhanger\\" took on a whole new meaning at the hands of KMM.  We became slaves to Mac's first-person narrative, with her arresting and hypnotic voice she enthralled us.  Our minds processed the facts and still we came away with imperceivable truths.<br />Shadow Fever takes off exactly where Moning left us in Dream Fever, prostrated upon a cliff next to the dead body of Jericho and the desolate, forlorn, Mac.  Mac's tortuous anguish is now ours, we are beside ourselves hoping upon hope that it is only a dream.  Sadly to say, the truth will not be denied...<br />The 411 On MacKayla and Jericho<br />MacKayla  Lane aka \\"Mac\\" is a southern peach, born and bred, or so she thought, until the death of her sister alters everything.  Mac's world changes the day she turns up in Dublin, Ireland, on the hunt for Alina's murderer.  Mac soon learns she is a sidhe-seer and  hence the metamorphose begins.  She soon becomes a force to be reckoned with.  In each of the books, we can give testimony to her transformation.  Yet, no transformation could every come to pass with out one, Jericho Barrons.<br />Jericho Barrons aka (JZB) is  the wealthy, brooding, mysterious and handsome owner of Barrons Books & Baubles.  Jericho has become both protector and mentor to Mac.  He has had to strip away the layers that were MacKayla, antagonizing her at every turn.  He needs Mac's special talents to track the book, aka Sinsar Dubh (book of dark evil magic).  He is secretive, and unwilling to answer Mac's questions.  Throughout the series, he has had to take extreme measures to ensure Mac's safety.  In each book we discover exactly what he is not. Our frustration only adds fuel to our every growing fascination with all things, Barrons.  Although, Mac never seems to be able to please Barrons, he has never failed to be her champion. There is a growing underlining wave of sexual tension between the two that only grows stronger in each book.<br />Mac has started on a journey without a known course, nothing is what it seems.  She has found herself in a world of ancient magic, and disturbing truths.  A war has begun with the lethal Fae, and she finds herself smack bang in the middle. She comes face to face with V'lane, a death-by-sex Fae, who becomes somewhat of a friend. Mac soon learns who killed her sister. She is then captured by the Fae Lord Master, who then has her abused by three Dark Princes, making her Priya (Fae sex addicted).  No one has ever come back from being Priya.  Mac seems to be doomed to a life of sexual addiction to Fae, but Barrons has other plans.  It didn't matter how long it took, Barrons never gave up on Mac.  He brings her back from a world of shadows and addiction. Yet, Mac seems to have a new addiction.  Jericho Barrons.  Mac learns that while she was being \\"cured\\" the walls have come down, and the world will never be the same.  As if things couldn't get worse, Mac learns that the Lord Master plans to captured her parents. At the end of this leg of the journey, Mac finds herself fighting for her life and everything she holds dear.  She then comes to face with face with her reality and finally she sees the path she must take.<br />The Beginning of the End (Shadow Fever)<br />Mac must learn to go on with out the one person she never knew was her existence.  Truths come crashing to the surface.  How can you go on, when you are no longer whole. Her soul has been ripped out of her, if only she had known the truth. Dying would not be just punishment for what she has done.<br />Enter Mac 5.0.. Mac is no longer the person she was.  She had changed, there was nothing to lose anymore.  Mac knows the answer to making the world right again.  She will capture the Sinsar Dubh and change all the hurts in the world. She has changed into a different Mac. She will align herself to the enemy, Lord Master, in the name of justice.  Barrons had always told her to adapt to the every changing world, adapt she would.  She had plans and will use every alliance she has to bring back those she loves. Just when Mac thinks there is only one course of action to take, in walks Jericho Barrons.<br />Mac is floored, her soul sings with happiness, until Jericho can't seem to forgive her for killing him.  If before there existed a sexual magnetism, it doesn't hold a candle to what is born in the aftermath of pain. There are things that are happening to Mac that have plausible explanations. Things that will make Mac take a closer look at herself and ask:  Who is Mac?  Am I human?  Fae? Sidhe-seer?<br />Mac and Jericho will join forces and with the help of an eclectic group of Fae, Druid Warriors, Sidhe-seers, Hunters and the Jericho 8, they will capture the book.  Everything that has happened to Mac has been a culmination bring her to this point in her life.  She will have to make choices that only she can make and the truths that will be revealed to her will change everything.<br />  My Thoughts...<br />What happens when one of the most captivating epic series of the decade comes to an incredible conclusion?  You CRY!  No just joshing ya!  Shadow Fever was everything I anticipated and more. As I read I was on edge, anxious, agog, and on cloud nine.  I have been a fan from the beginning. While many said that the first book was too slow paced, I now know that it had to be.  Our introduction to Mac 1.0 was a methodical and well thought out.  She was born to us in that first book, pink and clueless.  We've watched her grow and transform into what we would all want to be:  sexy, gorgeous, and with unlimited skin privileges to Jericho. Karen said that she knew all along how it would end.  KMM made bookstores sexy.  If only there were a Jericho in my neck of the woods. *sigh*  Shadow Fever is, in my opinion, an unbelievable kick-off to the 2011 reading year. Many will say that my review is mostly a recap of the other books in the series and has almost nothing about Shadow Fever. I didn't want to spoil it for anyone.  There are so many twist and turns in the series, everyone should be able to go on the same journey with Mac as I did.  Suspense and surprises at every turn.  Just as I traveled with  Mac as she sorted through the truth, so should anyone that wants to read the book.  I truly savored this book, I could not put it down.  I can count on one hand the books that I await with a greedy hunger, and Shadow Fever did that for me.  I'm am dripping with excitement about the up coming series, where we will have a glimpse into Mac and Jericho's lives.  As in the finale of the series, things have a way of coming back, or not really leaving in the first place, but transforming into something completely different.as done.   Enter Mac 5.0..

It is like it is working because the line shows up under the word, but the panel doesn&apos;t show up so I can&apos;t select the predictions. When it does show up, the predictions are good.

0756405890|5.0|If you were as devastated as me with George Martin's latest FLOP, then you need reparations...and FAST!  The Name of the Wind is the cleansing you need!    Rothfuss is the Shakespeare of the modern day. He knows how to craft a clever paragraph. He's talented on many levels. You can read this story for plot and characterization, but you can also read this as something of literary merit. Some full pages of his prose actually rhymes! It's so subtle and so beautiful you might actually miss it!    It isn't a perfect fantasy. The bad guys leave something to be desired in the plot, but I don't care too much. This writer is that darn good!
0307386171|1.0|One of the dullest books I've ever read. I kept waiting for it to get better, but it never happened. Somehow, this dismal plot manages to drag out over 200 pages. I was very disappointed.
0553801473|1.0|It is entirely possible that Martin either did NOT write the first 3 books or did not write the last 2 books...the notion that the same person wrote all 5 is impossible.  We could henpeck all the inconsistencies in style and tone and talent, but there's really no point. If you're a fan, you know something's wrong.<br /><br />I've read other stuff by Martin and it's pretty decent. Fever Dream being on of my favorite vampire books, I'd say the guy has some talent in writing. That said, NONE of his other books come close the the complexity and moxie of SOIAF.  I have theories as to why the first three books are not in the same league as the last two.  If you'd like to discuss the conspiracies, please comment here and a message will be sent to my hotmail account. My user-name here is name I use for my email as well.<br /><br />Is George RR Martin part of one of the largest literary consipiracies since George Eliot?? Let's explore the possibilities together.
B000JBWWRY|5.0|Borrowed this movie from a friend and my toddler was very sad once we returned it. Had to buy it used. Found it in great condition through from an authorized dealer on amazon. Some of the content is iffy (bratty language) but the music is wonderful.
B003TSEL7S|5.0|this book was just as good as all the other ones he has written. it was just as fast paced and full of action. all in all one awesome book.
B0013FXWU6|1.0|Terrible movie. What a waste of my time. Avoid at all costs. This movie could make an insomniac fall asleep in record time.
B002PN3J9E|4.0|Purchased this product on the advise of a friend, to help my daughter achieve the highest goal she can in her sport.  After listening to the audio CD's I have also learnt very valuable information which I can use in my own life.  I would recommend this to anyone wanting to change how they think and to develop into the best person they should be in their lives both in work and personal development.
1451629184|5.0|This is not an easy book to read because of the horrific years of pain and trauma she went through by a sadistic couple.  How she survived it is a miracle.  Jaycee has served her time in hell.  She is a courageous and lovely young woman.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|This was the first game I purchased on my new Photon 4G and it looks and plays great, elements in the game are placed a little different then the PC or NDS version but since the game play is basically the same, it's just a matter of getting used to pulling stuff from a different spot.
B003Y5H5A6|5.0|\\"Captain America\\" was a well thought out and cleverly orchestrated movie.  Chris Evans plays a man by the name of Steve Rogers who has to go to great lengths to qualify for military service.  After countless attempts at getting in to qualify for the draft his life is changed by a man who is touched by his intense dedication to serving his country.  The man is responsible for helping Steve Rogers transform his figure and become more physically powerful.  The character of Steve Rogers goes on to become \\"Captain America\\" and works tirelessly to lead hundreds of troops in battle to defend America and the rest of the world.  I admit that I at first did not plan to see the film, but was persuaded to do so by my husband (he really wanted to see it).  I obviously agreed to watch the film, and I am glad that I did because it exceeded my expectations.  Chris Evans is a great actor, and I look forward to seeing him in the 2012 showing of \\"The Avengers\\".  I wholeheartedly recommend this \\"Captain America\\" movie for anyone who has enjoyed any of the Marvel films.
0143034901|5.0|Fantastic book.<br />Fabulous love and its ugly freak-twin, all-consuming hatred.<br />Once again, love was shown as one of the most powerful forces in our life. On the one hand it might be the sweetest thing, on the other hand a devastating force.<br />Infinite kindness and searing revenge.<br />It was all about people. Within the story quite a few times I have come across situations that reminded me of \\"don't judge a book by its cover\\" rule. Quite often people were not what they seemed to be and stereotyping didn't help.<br />Elusive quest on which a young boy embarked early in his life, mysterious author along with a terrifying book hunter who like a horror character that sprang alive from ancient manuscript made the story a page turner. The Cemetery of Forgotten Books was a fascinating place. Each time I read about it it took me back to my childhood and the huge library with endless rows of books at my home.<br /><br />If romantic lurks in some quite nook of your soul, you should give this book a try.
B00005JMJ4|5.0|\\"Lost in Translation\\" is a great film starring Bill Murray who plays a successful actor named Bob.  Bob happens to be a millionaire who commands popularity and acceptance in Japan.  He is living in two worlds where he is striving to meet the needs of his employer, and that of his wife and family back home in the states.  He meets a college graduate named Charlotte (played by Scarlett Johansson) who also happens to be married and is accompanying her successful photographer husband to Japan. Charlotte plays a woman who loves her husband, but is also in the process of finding her professional role in life.  Charlotte's husband cares for her tremendously, but is unable to spend as much time with her as he would like due to work commitments.  Charlotte and Bob cross paths and end up being temporary friends in Japan.  They explore the various clubs and hangouts in Tokyo with their friends.  I do believe that this film had a strong story because it covers the universal themes of how essential it is to create a plan on where you want to go in life, and to creatively construct new plans  if and/or when setbacks occur.  For Charlotte she is only experiencing a temporary setback of pinpointing where she intends to professionally in her life. For Bob, he is doing fine professionally but he too is setting a new intention in his life (except more in his family arena).  I liked watching this film because it brought back some positive memories I had of  when I was living in Japan (via the U.S. military) during the time period of September 2000 until October 2003. \\"Lost in Translation\\" is best for anyone who enjoys seeing the idea of universal lessons being played out for a man and/or woman living in a different cultural setting.
0307454541|5.0|This is seriously the best book I've ever read and you're doing yourself a disservice by not reading it. I'm not usually into mystery novels, but decided to read this anyway and I'm so glad that I did. Larsson's writing style is both straight forward and gripping. He makes you feel as though you're right there in the novel alongside the characters. I could go on and on about this book but instead of reading this review, GO OUT AND READ The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo for yourself and experience the most intense literary ride of your life.<br />Happy reading!
B001DZ9GRE|5.0|Annie Lennox's greatest hits collection contain a good mix of her top hits from the 1990s and the millennium.  I remember being introduced to her music as a teenager (through the \\"Walking on Broken Glass\\" music video that was shown on VH1).  The video is very creative because there are many actors and actresses that are wearing costumes that are affiliated with the nobility of 18th century Europe.  The songfacts websites lists that the video is inspired by the \\"Dangerous Liaisons\\" movie. Both Annie Lennox and John Malkovich gave good performances in the \\"Walking on Broken Glass\\" music video. I am definitely now inspired to check out the \\"Dangerous Liaisons\\" film, and the song \\"Walking on Broken Glass\\" is fortunately contained in this collection. Disc One contains many of the 90's classics of Annie Lennox and Disc Two contains many of her millennium hits.  The third edition is the dvd that features the actual musical videos for the songs.  One of the musical tracks that is an additional favorite song and video is \\"Little Bird\\" (also on both the cd and dvd).  \\"Little Bird\\" is about a soul wanting to soar to great heights in life, and transform all obstacles into stepping stones to their dreams.  The video to \\"Little Bird\\" is fun to watch because there are many people shown playing as Annie Lennox doubles.  I also like the costumes and the theme of breaking free via the idea of dancing that is prevalent in the music video.  Annie Lennox's greatest hits is best to obtain for those who enjoy any of her songs and/or 90s/millennium music.
6304493681|5.0|This anime was my first exposure to anime in general aside from my fanship of Dragon Ball Z.  I must say, I was absolutely blown away by this movie.  It was genius, deep, dark, philosophical and a powerful commentary on contemporary society.    The movie follows members of a special group of Japanese national police officers referred to as section 9 and encapsulates their feud with the foreign affairs branch denoted as section 6.  The movie focuses on two cyborgs who have human brain cells (ghosts) and their entirely human counterpart who are working to track down a hacker called the \\"puppet master\\".  This hacker has been hacking into the cyborgs and have been controlling them remotely and having them commit crimes.  The movie follows the investigation into the puppet master, the conspiracies rooted deep within the Japanese government and the reason behind the puppet master's modus operandi.    The movie is extremely existensial with deep dark overtones of nihilism.  The movie focuses on the vulnaribility of computers and how they are ultimately able to enhance our lives while at the same time creating an ever present danger to us.  The movie also delves into Japanese conspiracy theory and is a commentary on the increased reliance of society on machine in general as well as a commentary on how burecratic pissing matches can destroy a society from teh inside.    Definately go and pick up this movie is is absolutely phenominal.  The animation is great for its time.  Just a slight note, the music is very odd and pecuilur and certain aspects of this movie can be slow moving.  I really enjoyed this movie and I think that anyone who has the slightest interest in philosophy, or contemporary social issues would enjoy as well.      Definately buy it.
B0057A6GA6|2.0|It&apos;s not a bad little game, and infact it looks rather good. Gets old quickly tho, and I&apos;m not a fan of multiple start and end points in tower defense games. Do yourself a favor and get hexdefense instead, at the time of writing this its even $0.50 less.
B004XJRQUQ|2.0|Let me start off by saying that my best friend told me that this is the best series in the world and that I would love it more than anything I have ever read. So when I started reading the series I was so excited and couldn't wait to finish them.<br /><br />That is pretty much as far as my excitement got. I can honestly say that I did kinda sorta like the first 2 books. There was humor that the author just slipped in that gave me a good laugh and there was action that made me keep flipping the pages. However the main reason I kept pushing through until the end was to find out what happens. I was also hoping to get info about the state of the rest of the world and not just the 13 districts. No such luck.<br /><br />At the end of the 3rd book I felt like I had just wasted several hours of my time. I could have read a few free Kindle books instead of this series I had just paid for. I really wish I hadn't of wasted my time/money on this series.<br /><br />But obviously plenty of people love this series, hence the ratings and the movie that is in production. I am just not one of them. Hopefully you enjoy it more than I did!<br /><br />SIDE NOTE: I recommend The Host by Stephenie Meyer over this any day. I am not a huge sci-fi person but I do love that book. Not exactly the same story line, but it does deal with the human race being threatened.<br /><br />UPDATE as of 3/24/14: Love the movies! :)
073934353X|3.0|I enjoyed the abridged audoo book, tho was a bit disappointed with how short it was abridged. Sadly you got more from the movie. It was still a light, enjoyable 2 hours.
0553801473|1.0|Don't waste your money.  Wait for someone to give you a brief summary of the book. It was so freaking boring, what happened to his imagination? I couldn't keep my eyes open. Next book I'm going to try to get off torrent just in case it sucks too.
B000VNMMPM|4.0|Angel-A is a wonderful little treat from Luc Besson. It's goofy, it's strange, and when you think you know what happens it's something different after all. Every scene is beautifully composed and the lead characters sparkle like the Eiffel Tower in the background. My guess is you'll watch it once and think, \\"Well, that was strange.\\" Set it aside for a few months and then view it a second time and you'll fall in love.
0375842209|5.0|Wow! This book took my breath away! A solid punch in the gut.<br />Made me miss a day of work to complete (Warning!) and had me howling in the end, something I don't remember doing from \\"To kill a Mockingbird\\" and \\"The Snowgoose\\" over two decades ago.<br />Maybe a little slow initially nad sentimental towards the end, but a true masterpiece.
B003Q6D25K|2.0|I initially didn't like the first movie but the subtle eeriness of it slowly sank into my subconscious, freaking me out for weeks afterwards. It was pretty much a good understated horror movie which is a rarity with all of the \\"in your face\\" horror flicks that abound nowadays. Then they made this sequel.<br /><br />Think about everything in the first movie that you liked, repeat that formula but heavily diluted. Where the first movie managed to sink into your head with its slow buildup, this movie flounders in an attempt to copy itself. Instead of lulling you into complacency, only to shock you with some new demonic activity, this movie just fell flat on its face. When the big finale does occur it lacks the punch that its predecessor had.<br /><br />There's no tension, no real buildup here. The basic storyline is a good idea but it would have been better served if it'd been condensed and shortened. The filler is what really destroys the tension in this movie.<br /><br />In case you're thinking that I'm not the target audience (fair enough), I saw this with one of my best friends. She loved the first movie. It scared her so badly that she slept with the lights on even with her fiancee sleeping in the same room with her. She was bored to tears by this movie and almost fell asleep several times.<br /><br />I'll still give PA3 a try, but the shine is officially off this series. Unless the filmmakers bring something new to the table instead of rehashing the same idea over & over again, I honestly think this series has jumped the shark.
B002O4J4DO|5.0|Yeah after I finally watched the DVD that really brought me back and reminded me why they've always been my favorite group, even today, 45 years later? I can remember when my dad brought home Cosmos Factory and this little kid, coudn't of been more than 6-7 years old got his first taste of what would be his favorite band ever. I also got lucky because my aunt knew Stu Cook so she got me a poster signed by John, Tom, Doug and Stu.
B004EI3ON4|4.0|I'd heard of Daft Punk here and there, and even run into their music on pandora.  When I saw this movie the music really made an impression, so I did some investigating online.  When I hear this music it reminds me of specific scenes from the movie, and when I watch the movie, I really hear and feel the mood the music is trying to portray.  To me this is just what a sound track should accomplish.  I was very disappointed to discover that this sound track wasn't nominated for an oscar.  I really enjoy listening to this sound track.  The dark electronic sounds are very cool, and it's very easy to visualize the scenes from the movie as I listen to each track.  There is one track, Rectifier, that sounds exactly like music from Gladiator; it's very easy to pick out.  I also wish the tracks were in order with how they were used in the movie; they're close, but there are some differences.  Other than that, I would recommend this sound track to anyone who enjoyed the movie.  Amazon's price made it an easy choice as well.
0385341679|5.0|What a great series...from start to finish...and Shadowfever was SO much better than I ever could  have imagined!

Thanks Karen for all the entertaining hours with your stories!  Can't wait to read more of the Fever world!
B0017I1FP8|4.0|Overall a good cd.  I purchased this one because I liked the music and haven't been disappointed.  I like to work with voiceless music in the background.  I also place where in the movie the music is at during work lulls.  Overall not a cd to dance or impress someone with, but nice to listen to and remember parts of the movie.

B002HNA95E|4.0|if you want to look at a history or road map to the pop landscape of the 80's and 90's, Madonna's \\"Celebration\\" is a perfect place to go. Madonna was the first 80's female star to take control over her image and fashion her career accordingly, something that often overshadows her accomplishments. However, has it just been a voice and a hook, everyone from Stacy Q to EG Daily would still be stars. Madonna was savvy enough to feed on the trends in music but somehow always manage to be about a half-step ahead of everyone else. It's a skill that evaded almost every other star of the period and makes Madonna one of the most influential female singers outside of Dianna Ross.<br /><br />\\"Celebration\\" (I'm speaking mainly of the 2-Disc edition) compiles all these trends and moments with varying degrees of sucess, and I will leave it to better minds to argue over things like what was or wasn't included, whose mixes should have been here or what LP Vs Single edits were dissed by their inclusion or not. But the music overall silences these discussions. Madonna's evolution from such fluffy dance fare like \\"Everybody\\" and \\"Burning Up\\" to the sex-charged \\"Like a Virgin\\" and \\"Material Girl\\" to the maturation of \\"Like A Prayer\\" and \\"Papa Don't Preach\\" show a talent that never stood on past laurels. She embraced pop, club, new wave, techno and showtunes while finding the producer to best suit her and her desires of the moment. Some of the collaborations were as fearless as they were over the top; she was writing with Bjork and William Orbit when most folks had no idea what these artists were doing.<br /><br />Maybe my only gripe is the sequencing; hearing the thickness of Timbaland's work on \\"Four Minutes\\" makes the thin 80's dance pop of \\"Hoilday\\" too much of a clash for me. Putting the songs in chronological order would have made this more interesting. The number of songs not here could have gone to a super-deluxe three disc set and still left off significant hits. So when's the singles box set going to arrive? Don't be surprised, as this album wraps up Madonna's contract with the WB. Comprehensive as \\"Celebration\\" may be, I'll guess there's more to come.oing to arrive? Don't be surprised, as this album wraps up Madonna's contract with the WB.

B005BW15XS|5.0|I bought this CD hoping there would be at least one or two great songs like Motivation.  Well, to my surprise I loved every single song.  I downloaded this CD before going on a road trip with my husband and three sons.  I had Kelly on replay from Chicago to the Wisconsin Dells.  This CD and a great pair of headphones made the five hours trip a joy.     There isn't a dud on this CD.   My current favorites are I'm Dat Chick, Heaven & Earth and Lay It On Me.  I've already played Motivation to death.   My last two purchases were Marsha Ambrosious and Jill Scott.  While I really enjoyed those CDs, Kelly's CD has a really nice mixture of music. I would rate both of those CDs four stars.  I would say five stars, but they both had a couple of songs that were duds.  I hope this CD starts to get the air play and publicity it deserves.  Kelly, thanks for the great music.
B000PDYVVG|1.0|The Deepest thing about this book? Is the way that marketing, and Oprah, got Millions of people ( myself, included. ) to dig Deep into our pockets to purchase it. Then, they made a movie. Julia Roberts, was the star! She looked, Amazing. Enough said.
B001VLXNLU|5.0|I won't lie, the first few chapters gave very little excitement to my imagination as the plot & storyline were unfolded in the beginning. It seemed all too generic & very reminiscent of Twilight with a Harry Potter twist. Needless to say, I was fully unimpressed... that is, until the Cherokee Legends were introduced. The idea of the Wiccan world colliding so gracefully with ancient Cherokee Legend is quite refreshing & very pleasing! Now I can't put the series down! I'm on edge, always waiting for the next installment. Zoey is an amazing heroin & I gladly applaud the Cast's for creating her.<br /><br />While the teen drama is never ending and often shallow, I believe it is necessary & gives the book yer another wonderful quality that I have often admired in Mary-Janice Davidson novels: it adds a touch of realism to  the story. No matter what evil Zoey may have recently battled against, she still desires in her heart to be a normal girl. I just love the contrast between valiant savior Zoey & teenager Zoey!
0385341679|5.0|I've been following Ms. Moning's Fever series from the beginning.  She wrote wonderful stories about highlanders that initially got me hooked on her writing.  This set was similar in setting with magic and paranormal activities ongoing, but the final book, Shadowfever, was the most suspenseful and surprising book I've read in a very long time.  Just when I thought I had the ending figured out, she would throw a new twist in the plot that kept me reading until I found myself asleep in uncomfortable upright positions in my bed or on the couch trying to finish another chapter to find out where the heroine, Mac, will be taken next on her journey.    The entire series is a must-read recommendation of mine, because it is definitely worth getting to this final installment to find out where these complex characters she introduces you to end up after the dangers they found themselves in.

B004UHF51S|5.0|Been following Michael Franks since the early 70's. This is IMHO by far his best work. Songs are well-crafted. Production and arrangements are stellar.

B0032Y8XH8|5.0|It's not often that you find an album where you love every single song on it. This is one of those rare albums. It's not just the music, it's the lyrics that make Mumford & Sons so unique. Every time I listen I get a new perspecitive on the meaning of a particular line. It's not a live album, but it has the energy of one.

0439796644|5.0|I am planning on seeing the play but before doing so decided to read the book. It is a quick read told from the prospective of the horse.  Horses have settled countries and gone into battle with/for us from the beginning of time.  Our kinship with these generous animals comes from their generosity and heart and great spirit.  After many uphill situations, the author delivered a very satisfying ending.
0385341679|5.0|I LOVED Shadow Fever!  I agree that it is very hard to review this book without giving away spoilers, which I absolutely won't do. I've been following the Fever Series from the start (First Book: Dark Fever), and the wait for this final installment to come out was tortuous. Literally, torture.  The series produces so many questions throughout its course that it almost becomes a game to figure it all out.... or an obsession, take your pick.   One that I enjoyed playing immensely!   It's not just the questions that fascinated me throughout the series.   It was the characters!  Karen Marie Moning is the best at creating people.   They are so dimensional, so real.   Shadow Fever more than satisfied all my questions, and satisfied my view of the characters. So far it is the only end to a series that I have ever been 100% satisfied with. It's not predictable how this book wrapped things up, but it is also not the type of ending to a series that goes so far out in the left field you are wondering if it is even part of the same series. It is PERFECT. Its also the type of book/series that you can read over and over again, even after you know how it all plays out.  Every time you read it, you will find new things to love about it, and catch new things that you didn't catch before.   There is not a single bad thing I could say about this book.   I missed two days of work when it came out, because it was THAT worth it.  I had to read it.  I had to know the ending!   I read more series than I can count. Seriously,  name a series, I've read it.  But this tops them all!
B005D9MUWY|2.0|at first i liked this keyboard, but it doesn&apos;t let you save new words and after some time my phone started crashing. the keyboard is freezing or it gets stuck on one letter.
B004S699K4|5.0|I bought this at Best Buy for a great price and it was worth it. Not the best transfer and the audio is 2.0 stereo, but you get what you paid for. Anyways, it's a great addition to my blu-ray collection! It's a great movie! And if you're waiting for Echo Bridge or something to do something better with this release then you're mistaken, Echo Bridge will hold on to the rights for these movies as long as they can. It's Halloween!
B004YXE438|5.0|I don&apos;t usually even download games, much less play them, but this game is great.  I installed it and immediately knew how to play, uploaded a custom image, and was hooked!  Great game!
142311339X|5.0|To start off, i was very worried about getting this book because it is so long, but i am sooo glad i bought it! I am not the type of person to read long books, but i thought i would give it a try since i loved The Kane Chronicles series and the Percy Jackson series. It may seem long and huge, however its such a good book that it goes by sooo fast. I garantee u will be reading more than 75 pages a day because u get so hooked on it! Every chapter is very exciting! This is the biggest book i have ever read in my life and is the best book i ever read!!! It is really hard to compare this to the Percy Jackson series, but i have to admit, i honestly thought this book was a little better. If your afraid u dont want to read it because it looks long or it looks boring, think again. You will not be dissapointed. Rick Riordan is very talented and by far my favorite author. I am looking forward to the next book of this series and will be pre-ordering it very soon! Please take the chance of buying this book, u will never regret it!!!!! : )
0823004325|5.0|I ordered this book with several others last week, but, to be honest, wasn't expecting all that much in terms of highly useful information.  I seem to have inadvertently become an art book collector in my search for the answers to what seem to me to be the most basic of questions about the makeup of the body and rendering it.  So to say that I was pleasantly surprised when I opened this book is a huge understatement.      Not only is this book comprehensive in its descriptions of the skull and face and the underlying structure, but it also goes into great detail about which combinations of muscle & bone movements make up the expressions evoking particular emotions.  All of my questions about the head and face have been answered by this one book.  It's also full of illustrations to accompany every thought.  I love the fact that the author really understands the visually creative mind - Rather than go into written diatribes, he includes short written descriptions accompanied by several visual examples.      The only thing I would change about this book is the fact that the illustrations appear to have been rendered in charcoal and some came out a little dark in the book's printing.  It's not a big deal, since they're not indecipherable, but I'd love to see a reprint with somewhat lighter illustrations or even with pencil drawings instead of charcoal (I know, a huge undertaking!).  I'm an advanced beginner and the author covers a lot of the mistakes I've been making in my drawings - something I haven't seen elsewhere.  I can't stress enough how much one week with this book has already improved my drawing ability.  I'm only hoping that, if this author hasn't already published a book on figure drawing, he will soon!  Long story short:  If you're a beginner or intermediate artist and can only get one book, make it this one; you'll see a drastic improvement in your understanding of what you're looking at and how to create artwork that is more true to life.  If you're an advanced artist, the multitude of reference illustrations and photos will prove to be an invaluable resource.
0451228375|5.0|After reading a book like POE you continue to hunt for books of Historical Fiction Genre. I was amazed at the detail and mastery Ken Follett displayed in POE.<br /><br />This book is not a copy of POE , yes its history, yes its same place but its 200 years after POE. The events in this will definitely take you to level two. Yes This man has a style which captures you from the first page itself.<br /><br />The book gives better details about History, Engineering and draws a detailed map of Human psychology.<br /><br />I loved the characters and the events that happen to each one of them.<br />You will notice how this master storyteller displays events that have no significance in the beginning but is part of the intricately planned plot of life in Kingsbridge.<br /><br />I have learned more about cunning, deceit and politics and been able to draw inferences from the book.<br /><br />Finished it in 1 week after refusing to start it.<br /><br />Read it to learn, to enjoy and to go through whirlwind of emotions that this book takes you through.
0061134007|3.0|I was somewhat baffled 100 pages into this. Nothing much happened. The novel begins with it's protagonist, Harry Hole, and his partner watching over a motorcade in Norway. Diplomats & the U.S. President are in town for peace-talks. The book then switched between 1999 & 1942 leaving the reader wondering what's going on. The jumping off point of the motorcade is left in the dust & just fades away.<br />Shortly afterward, the book takes off & becomes very enjoyable. Jo Nesbo has done a masterful job creating his characters, developing and weaving a tale. The translation of the book is also very smooth & very well done. The reader now sees the correlation between characters of WW2 & the present.<br />Alas, the book eventually becomes inundated with so many characters & small time dialogue you'll need a score-sheet to keep up.<br />The powerful plot & excellent story just become bogged down & the book becomes very tedious. It's over 500 pages & could probably benefit from having it pared down a bit. I got to the point toward the end, I began skimming through in order to finish it. It's a shame tedium got the best of this book. It could have been so very good

1897299214|2.0|2 Stars for all of the work the author put into the book but..     the book reads like a sunday comic strip. Short disjointed moments put together randomly and often quite repetetive.     The author strikes an always judgemental or condescending tone throughout and his observations rarely strike true chord of pathos. Just Western dogma and superior  attitude.    Most of the book seems like the author constantly complaining that about what HE cant have or do...HE cant have good food...HE cant get a bicycle..HE cant go out.     I cant think of too many moments in the book where the author hits a deep note of empathy for his subjects that might illuminate true feelings in the reader.     I had high hopes but was greatly disappointed.
B004YEJGEO|5.0|This game is a lot of fun and it is absolutely worth a buck. It is a unique puzzle game that will keep you entertained. Highly recommended.

B003YL4LYI|2.0|I too came late to the series but have read these over the last few months.  Have to say my addiction is pretty intense actually.<br /><br />After reading all of these consecutivley, I would have to say that A Dance with Dragons was the worst.  I undertand that long time GRRM fans have been waiting an eternity for this one to be released but what I don't understand is how HE could have allowed such a mess of book.  As others have said, Dragons went no where.<br /><br />GRRM, please oh please tell us that you have something coming soon to redeem this mess of a story and complete it in this life time.  Bring the dragons to Westeros and let winter finally come.  After 5 books you would think it would have.  Or is the money HBO is paying you blinding what brought you to this point?
B004YEJGEO|3.0|The game play is awesome!  That said, prisms are buggy, I often find that I have to delete them, or block lasers just to get them to work right. I sometimes end up with 1 laser in with no output, which should not be possible. The game also force closes, a sure sign of buggy code. Another minor gripe, there&apos;s no putting in a user name, so I can&apos;t let my kids play through the levels on their own progression. And, it needs a better tutorial, because switching the direction of the 2nd prism output is far from intuitive.

1439170916|5.0|The Emperor of All Maladies took me a while to complete, but it was well worth it.  Rarely have I gone through a book and wanted to read every page and focus on details, yet with this it came naturally.  The Emperor of All Maladies goes through the story of cancer.  Its history of discovery by the medical profession and the history of its treatment.  It discusses the origins of the disease, the triumphs and failure of treatment, the battles within the medical profession and the differences of approach that have been taken.  Every chapter is interesting and the book takes the reader on a complete journey through cancer's history with medicine with no background required.      The book is filled with narratives of pioneering doctors and the casework they did (both successfully and unsuccessfully).  The author goes through the thought process of various doctors in their respective places in history and specific context and describes how they came to their beliefs and conclusions.  In particular one gets a sense of the history of the different arenas where medicine battles cancer.  One is introduced to viral causes of cancer and radiation therapies.  One learns of the momentum that gathered with invasive surgery and the magnitude of flesh removal to eradicate cancer that much of the surgical profession came to believe in.  The author gives an indepth history of chemotherapy and how it came to dominate the options many cancer patients had.  Cancer was studied by means of outcomes of patient treatment rather than at the cellular level.  The history of cancer fundraising is given and its intertwinement with politics.      The biology of cancer is given in various parts of the book in line with the actual discovery process of it.  The author starts to really get into the biology of cancer as the critical voices (about the medical professions toolkit and lack of understanding of when and why the toolkit worked) in the book gathered.  The study at the molecular level of how uninhibited cell division takes place is introduced.  The discovery of how a virus could cause cancer is one of the first introductions to how gene manipulation could cause an explosive cancer.  From there the author takes the reader on a final journey introducing the complexity of cancer.  The author takes great care in describing the complex permutations required to develop and the subtle differences between some of these permutations.  In addition the reader is taken through the reasoning as to how these differences make treatments diverse and highly individual.    This is a comprehensive history of cancer that was interesting on every page.  After reading this I feel I got a sense of the history of cancer, the complexity that defines the illness and the immense challenges that cancer presents when searching for cures.  Though this takes some time to get through, I feel it was time extremely well spent and feel instilled with a real desire to keep up with developements in the medicine of cancer.

B0035G5IOE|4.0|I'll admit that I'm not exactly a fan of Wes Anderson's movies. The only film of his that I've seen is The Royal Tenenbaums (at age 16 when it hit theaters), and when I worked at a movie store, his other films were constantly being brought up by a bunch of hipster kids that would refuse to watch anything 'mainstream'. So when it was announced that Fantastic Mr. Fox was going to be directed by Anderson, I was a bit worried. Fortunately, this movie had me hooked within the first 10 minutes. Not only is the movie interesting, but it has gorgeous art direction, fantastic voice acting by everyone involved, and the animation is rough. Normally I'd be disappointed by that, but the style matches everything perfectly.    Mr. Fox is basically having a mid-life crisis. When the story starts out, he and his wife are caught in a cage when on a run to steal chickens from a farm. After finding out that they're going to have a child, Mr. Fox promises that if they make it out of the cage, he'll stop his ways and live a safer life. He does so, for a while at least, making his living as a newspaper columnist. But once the family moves into a new home and he discovers 3 farms run by 3 of the meanest men out there: Boggis, Bunce and Bean. The urge to live dangerously kicks back in, and he quickly raids them of their chickens, geese and apple cider, only to be tracked back to his home, which puts his family and the other animals nearby in danger. At the same time, his nephew Kristofferson has moved in, and is making his son Ash jealous in every possible way, mainly because Kristofferson is perfect. Things look bad, but Mr. Fox always has a plan, and needs to try his best to figure out how to take care of the 3 farmers.    One of the best things that the movie has going for it is that it doesn't talk down to the audience, and that it can be viewed by people of all ages. There's a little bit of violence from short fight scenes and guns, but I don't remember seeing a single drop of blood, even when someone gets scratched by another animal. I loved that the animation style was on the rough side, and not fluid like The Corpse Bride, as it just feels right for the movie. Fur and clothing move from frame to frame, a process that the crew calls 'boiling', and was picked up from the original King Kong. Every major character was interesting, and this is one of the few movies where I was cheering for the main character from start to finish. Little mannerisms of characters, from trademark whistles and clicks, to the sudden savage growling when eating a meal...it's all great. The tone of the movie stays the same too- it's light and comical. That might also be my only complaint. Everything's taken so lightly that there wasn't much of a threat from the 3 farmers, even at the very end where the climax is over just as quickly as it began. At the same time, it would've been odd to make things dramatic all of a sudden, but I would've liked more time with the farmers and seen just how mean they could be, instead of the leader of the bunch getting a few small outbursts.    The special features are on the light side, with under an hour of material to go through. You get the standard trailer, a minute long fake documentary on Whack-Bat, and a couple of featurettes going over the making of the movie and a short interview with Roald Dahl's widow, who genuinely praises Anderson and the crew for making a movie that she thinks her husband would've approved of. I enjoyed the 40+ minute behind the scenes look where you get a good idea of just how time consuming stop motion is, even if you're already aware of how much time goes into it. One animator reveals that to film an 18 second scene, she spent 8 or 9 days on everything. That's just crazy, and I have nothing but the highest respect for the animators, puppet makers, set and prop designers...everyone. It was also great to see how they recorded the voices for everyone: going on location to a farm, with one microphone around everyone at the same time. If the characters in the movie were out of breath after running, the actors would be too, and it makes things much more real. It'd be nice to have a commentary track on here, but I guess this is one of those cases where the director lets the film speak for itself.    I highly recommend Fantastic Mr. Fox to fans of animation or anyone looking for a unique family movie. The whole movie is a visual treat, with all the autumn colors, and it features a fast paced story that never drags on. I just might check out Anderson's other movies now.
B0000CD5I6|5.0|Excellent Christmas CD and so Tull.  I did read the lesser reviews ... can't imagine why there would be any, especially seeing that those who would buy this are familiar with Jethro Tull and/or are fans.  I put this right in the Aqualung category.

B004LWZW4M|4.0|There's so many CGI drenched flicks these days, one can mistakenly discount viewing yet another from other bad experiences. That I liked the \\"Planet of the Apes\\" story from the beginning in 1968 caused me to pass that line of thinking to see this movie, for better or worse. I'm glad I did. The main character is as completely CGI, but done well, or rather not terribly overdone. Add to that a nice spin on the age old story of well intended science running amok with the natural order of things, especially when put in the same equation as greed, and what could be a simple plot line made appealing by modernization for contemporary audiences actually is done well, evading the almost animated appearance of other movies who do so. The story line is pretty predictable, but well executed in all respects. The lines between good and bad, acceptable and unacceptable are drawn almost immediately, laying the cheering lines for an entertaining, pretty fun movie to watch. There's some nice winks to the original \\"Planet of the Apes\\" that will fly right by contemporary audiences, but proudly picked off by the genre's biggest fans. And they're not gratuitous. They're used with good timing and reason. The flick moves real fast, but by the end, you can see why. There's no way this story could be told in one movie, and the ending reeks of a sequel. I'll be there for that one too. Thumbs up.

0767827902|5.0|This critically acclaimed motion picture deserved all the accolades given it.  Director Peter Bogdanovich did an amazing job putting together a winning cast for this bittersweet story taken from Larry McMurtry's novel. The acting and cinematography<br />is superb, and draws the viewer into the venue. One almost feels<br />as though you're there.  Choosing to film in black & white was<br />appropriate for this 1950's story of a small Texas town drama. The background music adds to the reality of this surprisingly<br />frank drama of social and sexual mores of its time. In that regard, I believe its a classic!

0062060554|2.0|I love thrillers. The premise to this one (although it sounded suspiciously like the plot to the movie Momento) had promise. And then there were all the gushing reviews. But, having read the book, I just don't get it.     Amazon picked this as one of the best books of the year? On what basis?    The writing is terrible. Just terrible. Flat characters. Purple prose. (I got so bored with the narrator's husband passionately telling her every minute how much he loved her, and so bored with her constantly asking herself, 'do I love him? do I love him?') And, as so many people have pointed out, the holes in the plot are big enough to steer the space shuttle through.     I'm as willing to suspend my disbelief as any other avid reader...but to buy that this woman could so easily be brought up to speed on her condition / history every morning; that she would trust so readily what strangers told her; that she would be able to read through hundreds of pages of her notes every day, absorb them factually and emotionally; and add coherently to the narrative, all while running around discovering new clues is just too much.     Plus, the predictability! I guessed it all within 50 pages.     My summer book goal was to read my way down the best-seller list. I usually go by reviews and recommendations rather than sales ranking, but I wanted to see what was commercially successful these days. I've had a lot of fun (finally read Stieg Larson's trilogy) and discovered new writers I wouldn't have otherwise read. But books like this just blow my mind because of the discrepancy between the hype and reality. (Likewise, the Informationist....but that's another review.)
B0041T52S6|5.0|A good movie that in opinion was over due. This movie is funny and entertaining. I tip my hat to the writers.
0670022411|3.0|This book was great linking history and mythology together. It took you into a spell and held you, I loved the back story's. However when it came to the end I was thoroughly let down. The book had me bound I kept looking for more page's it was as if the author just couldn't get any-farther in the book. I want to know what happens to everyone. How can you build a connection with a character then sever their tie's to the read's the way the she did. What a let down.

B0035G5IOE|5.0|One of my favorite movies of all time. Absolutely great work, and to think of all the time and effort put into this movie just makes me smile. Well done. The special features show you a glimpse of the tireless work the team pulled off, I loved seeing the models and tricks they used to achieve everything! Great for all ages, could watch it many times and still laugh every time.    Fantastic is the first word for a reason...
B004YCKJSS|3.0|...but still not a very good transfer.  I rate the movie itself a solid 4.5 stars and the DVD quality 1.5 stars.  I'm assuming many of you were like me, waiting for a anamorphic release of this movie.  Well, the wait is over, but I'm not sure it was worth it.  This is a poor transfer from Echo Bridge.  Do a search on this company and you will see that they are famous (infamous) for producing cheap DVD's and Blu-ray's.    In addition to lot of scratches on the film, there was a black border all the way around the picture.  And before you comment that I have my settings screwed up, I double checked them.  It is set up for 0% overscan (basically a pixel-to-pixel rendering or just-scan setting).  The black border disappears when I set my Blu-ray player to 5% overscan, so maybe that's why they did it, but it's not right.  Every other DVD that I have does not have this black border (it's about a 1/2\\" wide on my 54\\" plasma TV).    Anyway, if you are looking at this product, you probably are a fan of this movie.  And this is probably the best it is going to look for while now that Echo Bridge has the rights to it, so take the plunge and get it.  At least it is priced about right - it is a really great, underrated film.  If you are looking for reviews of the actual movie, take a look at the 130+ mostly positive reviews from the Buena Vista release ([[ASIN:6305327084 Beautiful Girls]]).
1582701709|5.0|I keep this book by my bedside and have quotes from it around my home!!  It has given a fresh light to my life---I see positive changes already!!
B004LWZW4M|4.0|\\"Rise of the Planet of the Apes\\" has terrific computer-generated effects and a decent script going for it. Another positive is the character of the chimpanzee Caesar, who is developed well by the screenwriters--from a baby, to a trusting child, to the leader of the simian freedom fighters.<br /><br />James Franco plays the main human character--a scientist who is working on a drug to cure Alzheimer's patients (one of whom is his father). Of course, he first tries it out on the chimpanzees in his company's laboratory, and one, called \\"Bright Eyes\\" (what the orangutan scientist called Charlton Heston in the original 1968 \\"Planet of the Apes\\" film) becomes very intelligent. Franco winds up taking this chimp's baby home and becomes his \\"father.\\" And this animal, Caesar, has inherited his mother's intelligence and green eyes.<br /><br />As in \\"Avatar,\\" the motion-capture/computer-animation techniques are very well done, and Andy Serkis, who \\"plays\\" Caesar does an excellent job.<br /><br />The film has a few good action sequences and several simple moral lessons to be inferred. It also drags in a few spots, particularly when Caesar is incarcerated. All in all though, \\"Rise of the Planet of the Apes\\" is a fairly entertaining, technically accomplished film.

B004R0WKNE|1.0|Save your money, not worth the $4 I paid to stream.  This movie lacks as a comedy and in my opinion it had no real heart.   Harrison Ford just walks through his performance as the old news curmudgeon.  Rachel McAdams is very cute, but has no chemistry between any of the co-stars.   The movie never get going, at the half-way point I was ready to ready to fall asleep.  I made a mistake and powered through to the end.  The film remained a complete disappointment.
B004UUKDNA|5.0|So, I bought this for my sister as a present and I am so happy I did, couldn't have been more spot on, if you enjoy being happy and you like to smile, I suggest this band, it is their debut album and they have already had numerous sold out shows and you can hear why on this album, musically and lyrically it is so much fun, great car music, great music for any mood. I suggest this to everyone, it's awesome.
B0050PYNOY|4.0|Your Highness is a diamond in the rough that lovers of raunchy comedy cannot afford to miss! It follows the adventures of two brother princes (James Franco and Danny McBride). When Fabious' (Franco) fiance (Zooey Dachanel) is captured by the evil wizard Leezar, he and his brother Thadious (McBride) must set off on mighty quest to win her back and foil Leezar's (expectedly gross) evil plans!     Along their journey, the brothers meet a cast of funny and totally inappropriate characters that include a mighty warrior woman (Natalie Portman), a molesting wizard, and a *ahem* well-endowed, frisky Minotaur. Their new friends and foes lend them strength in one form or another all leading up to the climax as they face off against the mighty and evil Leezar.     All-in-all, Your Highness is an excellent example of how a raunchy comedy is supposed to be made. You take one part A-list talent (Portman, Franco) and mix it with one part up-and-comer (McBride), add generous amounts of gross-out jokes in between good bouts of action  and let it all stew in a medieval setting.    This easily earned a four-star rating from me.
B004L35GAQ|5.0|This is not something I would usually pick out musically to listen to, but I am so happy I did, this album is such a change in pace, for the better, Aaron Bruno did an amazing job and I congratulate this album with much praise. This is coming from someone who is deeply passionate about music and this is such fun music, you cannot help but dance and sing to it no matter who you are.
B004D1GZ2E|4.0|The numbers don't lie. This is an excellent album that has spent ages at the top of the charts. The songs are great, Adele's performance is great, but the quality of the recording is just mediocre and disappointing.<br /><br />On these types of albums, where the singer's voice is such a focal point, I really expect the engineer to do a better job of capturing the gift the artist is sharing with us, and that didn't happen here. The dynamic range is squashed, the texture is smoothed-over and even the backing tracks seem \\"blurry\\". Maybe I had my hopes up too high for this one.
B000JLTRIG|3.0|The seventh season of Charmed fell short.  The story line was a bit scattered.  It seemed like the story arcs were no longer spanning the entire season in order to bring meaning, but each episode stood alone.  I felt that this made the story lack and took a lot of the heart out of the series.  In my opinion, they should have ended the show with Chris being born at the end of season 6.  I bought this season to complete my series collection, but it's not worth it on its own.

B005AUWXZ0|5.0|Audience's high expectation of Pixar is duly noted but my 7yr old had a blast. And I did as well. No heart to the story? How about fun and laughter? and friendship? The backdrop is 100x better than the first one. This one had a lot more action scenes than the first. Sure the emphasis is not on McQueen but let's not be so picky and just enjoy the awesome CGI and great fun!

B0007939NO|3.0|The idea of Brigadoon is lushly romantic; it's a shame the movie lacks the magic & romance of an emotionally engaging movie. Part of the magic is lost because, apparently due to budget limitations, the movie is filmed on a soundstage. This makes the film small...in every sense of the word. With the Scottish Highlands being as important a \\" character\\" as any of the people, it is a shame that the lush beauty of this land is diminished to a sound stage with obviously painted backdrops. So often while watching the film, I felt jarred by the fakeness of the sets. It prevents some viewers, like myself, from becoming immersed in the magical story. And, for a fantasy to work, one needs to be transported to that imaginary world. This simply doesn't happen here.  Another reason that I was unable to connect emotionally to the movie is the lack of any character development. This is especially critical with the Gene Kelley-Cyd Charisse couple. It's hard to see the reason for an intense love occurring; plus, unfortunately, there is a lack of romantic chemistry between these two. Also jarring is the extremely bitter & cynical Van Johnson. With the exception of the marvelously whimsical soft-shoe duet that he performs with Kelley, this character seems to be too harsh a counterpoint to the sweetness of the townsfolk. And that's another problem, too: this supposedly magical place felt saccharine and one- dimensional.   Finally, with the exception of \\"It's Almost Like Falling in Love,\\" none of the songs are all that compelling. The dances fail to captivate, too: there's nothing like Fred Astaire's scorching firecracker number in \\"Holiday Inn,\\" or the breathtaking Astaire-Rogers final duet in \\"Follow the Fleet.\\" This lack spells trouble for any musical. You've got to have good singing and dancing in a musical. Otherwise, what's the point.   There is, however, enough good to partially redeem some of the film's weaknesses. Some of the ensemble dancing is quite good; the schoolmaster is believably warm & wise, giving the story behind the miracle of Brigadoon credibility, the costumes are stunningly colorful and well- designed; and the inimitable Cyd Charisse graces the movie. Others have commented how little like a Scottish lass she appears. But the elegance and purity of her dancing more than overcomes this potential problem. On whole, then, this movie has some enjoyable moments. It simply lacks being one of MGM's finest.

B004YEJGEO|4.0|It has a great concept and has the right amount of challenge for a puzzle game. My only complaints are with the controls and the way the prisms are programmed. If the controls were smoothed out and the prism logic was more friendly, it would be near-perfect. Definitely worth $0.99, though.
B001TWT0AE|5.0|I'm a fan of American and Italian westerns (as well as Kurosawa's masterpieces) and only recently saw this for the first time. In my opinion, THIS MAY BE THE GREATEST OF ALL WESTERNS. This is movie making and story telling at its very, very best with an ending that's impossible to forget!
B000001FDQ|4.0|\\"Rising Force\\", the neo-classical metal epic from a young Yngwie Malmsteen, shook the guitar world and raised the standard of technical excellence forever. Almost overnight, guitarists learned it was possible to play a guitar nearly as fast as a classical violinist plays a violin, and a mass of players followed in Malmsteen's footsteps to release neo-classical dirges of their own. \\"Rising Force\\" is definitely worth owning for the six instrumental classics alone--\\"Black Star\\", \\"Far Beyond The Sun\\" and \\"Evil Eye\\", to name but a few.
B0058P7KUA|1.0|Downloaded this app when it was offered for free.  Removed it shortly thereafter.  Its just a storage hog and gets old realy quick.
B004YXE438|3.0|Nice puzzle game. The visible white border on the pieces does tend to make it easier, but using the higher piece count can offset that a bit. \n\nMy only concern is the power consumption.  Make sure you kill the process when you&apos;re done or it will suck your battery dry. Check your battery consumption percentage and this will be at the top of the list. It was showing 87% of all computing time, and I didn&apos;t even know it was still running.

B000MGBSI0|5.0|Loved this show in the 90s and still loving it. \\"Melrose Place\\", the spin-off of \\"90210 Beverly Hills\\" has great storylines and very good dialogues, love, intrigue, affairs, suicide,  pregnancy, rape, etc and many things more.<br /><br />Special guests: Marcia Cross as Kimberly Shaw, William R.

B003L77GH4|3.0|Whilst I do enjoy the vampire diaries and make sure I watch every episode, sometimes I groan in frustration at the idiocy that this show throws out. I am quite convinced that the writers have a plot wheel on their desk and when looking for a plot point, they spin that wheel. That's the only reason I could think of for some of the stupidity that crops up during this show:    Highlights include:    1. Elijah not killing Klaus because Klaus mentioned about his family. Sorry but how long has Elijah been alive? As soon as he failed to stake his brother, I could see the betrayal coming a mile off. That seems crap to me as why would Elijah believe his brother? Why wasn't he anticipating this staking? Surely he should have said, 'fine they're alive and I'll find them myself' before staking Klaus. My friends and I howled in annoyance at this.    2. Tyler not helping Caroline when she was kidnapped by Jules. I mean, he barely knows Jules and co, but he has known Caroline for years and she stood by him during his first werewolf transformation, yet he lets her be tortured and barely raises an eyebrow. I mean if given a choice between an old friend and some new people that you don't know, you would logically side with your old friend. Made absolutely no sense.    3. Why does Klaus want Stefan to go all blood addicted? I mean if Klaus has got a secret crush on Stefan, fine, but really it makes no sense. Klaus can certainly do enough damage by himself, why does he need Stefan?    4. Turning Jenna into a vamp, I mean it was shocking and all, but really was it necessary? It seemed overly complicated and used purely to angst Elena and Jeremy some more.    5. The sudden 'sacrifice for another spell' that supposedly redeems John. Sorry but that was an ass pull.     6. And Elena's desire to save Bonnie, especially when they find out just what else the ritual needs. Erm excuse me, you don't want to sacrifice your friend, but you're quite willing to kill yourself and two others. Bravo foryou Elena. We would have preferred Elena sacrificing herself after exhausting every other possibility, not ignoring everything else in order to sacrifice herself. (shades of Bella Swan anyone?)    These are the few I can think of atm, but when I watch this show with friends, we do enjoy it but every episode, something utterly random and ill thought out happens. Hence the 3 stars. Love the actors and quite enjoy that it is different to the book. Luckily the enjoyment I get from the show outweighs the idiocy that frequently happens.
B004LWZW4M|5.0|I wasn't expecting much out of the movie. I love Planet of the Apes, and I was excited about seeing it, but I didn't expect it to be mind-blowingly amazing.    As it turns out, it is.     The movie doesn't start out with the actual \\"Rise\\" of the Apes; it takes a while to develop the characters, and depicts exactly HOW the apes came to take over. I found this a very smart decision, and the film benefits from it. I'm not going to tell you much of the plot; just know that the humans experimented on the apes. They grew smart, and attempted to take over. It may sound generic, but the emotion and character development is very dominant here.    The Motion Capture is very well done. There are no humans dressed up in monkey suits (obviously). The ape animations are fluid and realistic. Considering that the same person who did the motion capture for Gollum in Peter Jackson's Lord of the Rings trilogy did the motion capture for Caesar (the main ape character), this should be expected. Extremely well done.    I would usually come up with a flaw to balance out the pros with the cons, but I can't. The film is utterly fantastic; so much so that I can't think of a flaw. This should be a sign that you should go see it right now.     I mean it. Right now.
0553801473|5.0|The six year wait was well worth it.  This book has everything I've come to love and respect about ASOIAF: memorable characters, intriguing plot, twists you'd never see coming.  If you're a fan, stop reading this review and go buy it.

1936719118|5.0|This is a great view of business that is absolutely surprising to discover. I didn't expect much from such a small book but there are principles within that I will apply not just to my business but life as well.
0553381695|2.0|This isn't a negative review--just a very, very disappointed one. After Game of Thrones I looked forward to Clash of Kings with huge anticipation.  It doesn't deliver.  It is very well written and if it stood alone it would be fantastic.  However, it is just more of the same.  Now a hundred pages into book 3 I realize it was a big mistake to read these consecutively.  They are all some more of before.<br /><br />Lots of heads getting lopped off.  Lots of what is, for some readers really kinky sex (brother on sister/dwarf on whore) and lots of evil vanquishing good. Lots and LOTS of evil vanquishing good.  It's okay if this is the author's world view but after 1600 pages of it I find his perspective tedious and/or depressing.  If Martin had written the story of World War II Hitler and Stalin would have conquered the world in a romp.<br /><br />Apparently this author believes good is not only naive--it is really, really stupid.  Eddard Stark is so noble and  virtuous he has to tell Cersei he is going to expose her secret!!!  Apparently being heroic means being a dumb ass.  Early on in Book 3 Catelyn is considering letting Cersei's evil twin go, ready to trust him to do the same for her daughter.  I just couldn't bear to see this supposedly strong, intelligent woman behave so stupidly to move a plot along.<br /><br />So this is where I have decided to stop.  If Martin wants to write about the sex lives of disfigured dwarves,  triumphant evil and moronic virtue, okay.  I live in a world far more balanced.  And it is not a fantasy of mine to inhabit dark and dumb.
B004EPYZQ2|5.0|I go to the movies to escape reality and have fun...as a cop who has enough excitment and stress it's nice to imagine I am a kid again. Thanks for the ride JJ Abrams I will definately be buying the blu-ray to enjoy with friends and family. I will be turning up the bass and volume and watching as they jump out of there seats. This movie will hopefully live the life of \\"classic\\" terrific kids movies as goonies, sandlot, ET amongst plenty other really great movies. I brought my girlfriend, two people both kids at heart but in reality are middle aged.  We walked out of the theater feeling we had just went to Disneyworld or just left after watching Star wars for the first time. We went to dinner grinning from ear to ear, saying that it made us feel like kids again. I know movies like this are not for everyone but for those who have kids inside themselves which are allowed to let their imagination run away for the brief movie time.  There is so much to enjoy about this movie. I wish I was 10 again then my feelings would be age appropriate. I find that sooo many people over analyze stuff today who really need to relax.  This movie is and will be a keeper which will be fun to watch over and over just to see folks jump at certain parts of a really good kids movie! Thanks for reading and to all the negative haters...one word...CHILL!!!
B0031RAOVY|5.0|This is a show telling about the love and remembering for a man from his dog.  It is beautiful.
B005DD7H50|3.0|I am not sure if I have seen a main storyline with more potential wasted.<br /><br />So a person with limitless brainpower would use it to make money on Wall Street and run for politics? Really? The imagination of the writers were certainly limited, and that's too bad, because this film had its unlimited potential reach only about 5-20% of its capacity (depending on whom you believe).<br /><br />This isn't a smart film. It is a trick; a gimmick with no real substance.<br /><br />There are, however, few saving graces. Bradley Cooper (main character) is very convincing as an actor. I am convinced if he reaches 100% of his acting potential, he would be worthy of an Oscar, and he is far more than 20% there.<br /><br />Before anyone tries to copy the concepts of this film and make yet an another script of enhanced-brainpower person making riches in Wall Street, then I suggest such person take more NZT 48 and enhance his/her own brain function first.<br /><br />And how come the brother-in-law gets himself killed? Doesn't he know taking that pill will save his life from assasins? And how come he never gives it to those who want it? I mean it's for sale. Just sell it. But I suppose no one in the writing team has thought of that. More NZT 48 please.
B004XE0P5E|4.0|Bon Iver's second album sounds as beautiful as the first. The melodies are really well-put together, the instruments give a richness to the sound of the album. My problem with the album is that Justin's voice is muffled and it's very difficult to hear what he's saying. Which is a shame because he's a wonderful singer and his lyrics really touch me.     I'm giving this record a solid thumbs-up though, because the overall experience is amazing and despite its flaws, Bon Iver is a worthy follow-up to For Emma, Forever Ago. If you're new to Bon Iver, start with For Emma, Forever Ago, and if you like it, be sure to give this record a shot.
0156034565|2.0|A somewhat shy and reclusive fisheries scientist in Britain is contacted through the British government bureaucracy by a Yemeni sheikh for the absurd project of creating a salmon industry in his country. Meanwhile, his childless marriage to a successful economist is crumbling.    This book has been a huge success but I must say I wasn't too impressed with it. It is supposed to be a satire, but I didn't find it particularly funny or witty, or even well written for that matter. While it is easily read, the characters lack depth. I think the book has some amusing insights about such matters as the absurd workings of the British bureaucracy, the difficulties in a modern marriage when the wife is more professionally successful than the husband, the insularity of much scientific research and the general uselessness (not to mention smugness) of much of international cooperation projects, but this could have been much better written.
0670022411|2.0|It started out a little slow but I was very interested in the main character Diana, so I kept plugging along.  I almost put it down when the I OWN YOU & YOU DO WHAT I SAY crap started.  Matthew is your typical 1500 year old vampire in a romance.  He hasn't learned over the years that women don't want to be told what to do anymore.  Apparently the author hasn't figured that out either.  I stopped reading when Diana and Matthew got to Diana's family home and her aunts started in as well, that was enough for me.  If you want that kind of crap in your romance pick up the usual paperback romance novels. Don't waste your time on this one, it's too long for that.
B004BF6NX8|5.0|A film for our time, a film for the ages. Heston and Loren ignite the screen in a spectacle that rates with the all-time greats. Although this disc has some minor technical issues, it's worth buying since we may never see a proper Region A release (thanks, Weinstein.)
0061928356|3.0|The author of this book obviously understood Indian culture and customs and seemed to have a base idea of what it would be like to be an American women who was infertile, or who adopted a child, it was painfully obvious she did not do much research or have her notions vetted by a person of that culture or situation.  I am told this is her first try at a novel and its not bad for a first try, however, hardly worth the full price in a retail situation
B002SSUQFG|2.0|I'm usually not inclined to review products; however, here I feel obligated. My last Seiko served me for just under 30 years. This one, three hours. While appealing to the eye, it doesn't seem to function as a watch. And by the way, for those wondering, according to the manual it shouldn't be worn while swimming.     The generic instructions, small intractable crown, twists and turns required to set the day, date, time, not to mention language, as well as the motion needed to keep it running, all, make this watch more trouble than it's worth. It took a couple hours to set and by the next morning had stopped ticking. Nooo.... The ordeal still gives me nightmares. I returned my new Seiko shortly thereafter and purchased a Citizen Men's BM6400-00E Eco-Drive Canvas Watch. More expensive but in my opinion, well worth it.

0439023521|3.0|It's okay. The protagonist may be appealing to tween girls, but many of the rest of us will find her (and the other paper-thin characters) to be somewhat annoying. The plot is vaguely interesting.    All in all I expect the movie may be better than the book, since 2 hours will compress this fluff down into a possibly-entertaining visual experience.
1400052181|5.0|I studied Human Genetics at University for 3 years and never once was Henrietta Lacks mentioned... I find this shocking and backwards following reading this book.    The advances that her cells have made in the world of genetics and science in general are massive, and I agree that as others have mentioned, this should be compulsory reading for students of science.    Aside from the scientific side of things, there is a story of a real person and her family who were morally hard done by, by scientists of the day. The book is beautifully written, engaging and one of the few books I've ever read that I literally didn't want to put down.    In summary a great book that should be read by everyone, in my opinion!
0439023491|2.0|I liked the first book okay. I've read the Twilight books and thought those were okay as well.<br /><br />This book isn't. It continues the tale of Katniss in a dull, uninspired fashion, and is full of the protagonist's whiny naivete. Maybe this sort of dreck is appealing to tween girls, but anyone else should just skip this and read a synopsis if they found the first book engaging. Summarizing the plot advances will only take a couple of succinct paragraphs.<br /><br />I sure hope the third book gets better.

B003Y5H542|1.0|I must say, the colors, visuals and animation are spot on; however, the lead character (Rango) is not likable at all and the plot is gross and disgusting if the first 10 minutes of the movie are any indication of things to come.<br />I turned off the movie when Rango crashed into the highway, disgustingly shed its skin twice and then went on to have a conversation with a sort of armadillo that had been run over by a car; yep, that's exactly what we parents want our kids to watch. Thank God my 5 year-old lost interest 2 minutes into the movie.<br />Not appropriate for kids of any age, period.

0694003611|5.0|My daughter is almost 8 but special needs and she has loved this book since I first read it to her as a baby. It is her absolute favorite. Even now she loves it and so does my 3 year old. I'm not sure what it is about the story and pictures but it has always been their favorite and is perfect for bedtime. I have read it so many times I know it by heart now. Most kids that I know have this book and have liked it, including mine so I highly recommend it.    I only wish they would put it on kindle (I read on the iPad so it'd still be in color)  because I have been through so many copies of this book over the years and it gets expensive to keep buying it over and over. Plus I'd like to have it so I can take it with me wherever and it wont get lost because the kids like to drag the book around lose it and then beg me to read it to them.
1451629184|5.0|But the merits of her book far outweigh the literary crimes elucidated so tritely in some reviews.  Dugard takes us on an experiential tour inside the four walls (or lack of them) of a demon's own personal hell. This is the voice of an eleven year old POW trying to make sense of a cruel, psyche-snatching introit into, well, I guess you can call it traumatic insemination.  In this dark, ipsilateral, topsy- turvy milieu beyond familiarity, in which perverted sex, enforced pregnancy, backyard barn-living, and other insanity-based games played a huge part, what else could she do but befriend spiders and cats?  Obviously she adores her children, despite the squalid, depraved origins of their conception, which makes her truly an iconic figure of forgiveness and absolution.  Flat affect, numb dispiritedness, Stockholming meekness...sensory deprivation doesn't help you think outside the box, and steals your identity like any card-carrying thief.  Yes, she's not much of a writer, but yes, she's so much more.  A heroine, a warrior, and a force majeure who held herself together with sheer, vigorous willpower always at the ready.  You go, girl.

0553801473|2.0|The series has completely run out of steam.<br /><br />Fair warning, here be spoilers.<br /><br />George R.R. Martin continues to deliver excellent dialogue and sparkling prose, but his \\"terror tactic\\" writing (where he builds up a point of view character only to be cut-down in cold blood, e.g., Ned Stark, Rob Stark, Kevin Lannister, the Onion Knight, the King Beyond the Wall, et.al.) has finally produced the result that it is nearly impossible to care about any of George's characters.  (Why invest the emotional energy when the character is likely to die, no matter how improbable the reason?)  Neither the murder of the Onion Knight nor the murder of the King Beyond the Wall had to occur to promote the plot in DwD.<br /><br />The plot is soooooo plodding in DwD that you have to wonder if the purpose of the glacial pace is only to wring out another novel from a cash cow.  The filler pages go on and on and on about flora and fauna.<br /><br />Our Dragon Queen decides to hang out across the sea when given the opportunity (13 vessels) to go home and reclaim her birthright.  She also cages up her dragons (well, the two that she and her minions can fool or capture).<br /><br />What?!!?  While character development and change are important in great stories, this particular change seemed to be a pre-mature birth.<br /><br />It just makes the series drag on and on.<br /><br />When Tyrion falls off the side of the barge into the deadly water, I actually felt relieved, but, since Tyrion is George's alter ego in the series, the dwarf is improbably back a few chapters later.  (The means of recovering the dwarf that fell down into the murky river and was essentially drowned is glossed over in the book.)  Of course, George will just kill Tyrion off in the first chapter of the next book as a way of saying, \\"nah-nah-boo-boo\\" to his remaining readers.<br /><br />Jon Snow ends up helping out our usurper king too.  Why?  Who knows?<br /><br />And the god of the deep ends up being ... I can't even bear to tell you in the review; it is sooooo silly.<br /><br />Then, there is the Deus ex Machina and returned minor character at the end of the book who kills off K. Lannister.  The character's appearance is not so much a dramatic plot twist as a \\"head scratcher.\\"  It completely destroys suspension of disbelief.  Also, the character, who was previously portrayed as completely amoral if not actually evil, now \\"rides in on the white charger\\" as the savior of the Seven Kingdoms.<br /><br />What?!?!?  Why?!?!?<br /><br />Actually, more to the point, it is hard to even care.<br /><br />I understand that the HBO mini-series was very good.<br /><br />Hopefully, if HBO gets to the point where the Feast for Crows and Dance with Dragons takes place, the playwrights will take significant liberties with the story.<br /><br />In service,<br /><br />Rich<br />[...]can't even bear to tell you in the review; it is sooooo silly.<br /><br />Then, there is the Deus ex Machina and returned minor character at the end of the book who kills off K.

0385341679|5.0|I can honestly say that the Fever series and in particular this book, Shadowfever, has given me a whole different perspective on reading. I rarely come across a heroine as dark and light as MacKayla Lane, who is so complex it's hard to imagine she only lives in our imaginations. This series for me was a chance to get away from the worries of everyday life. I simply cannot wait for more new novels from Karen Marie Moning who has endeared herself to me through this series. I highly recommended reading the first four novels IN ORDER so you don't spoil the story for yourself! You are truly missing out by not adding these books to your collection! I love you Barrons! :)

0385341679|5.0|Although this could be a stand-alone novel, it is the culmination of one series while tying in characters from another. Insightful to the human psyche, with more than a little spectacular imagination mixed in for good measure. Difficult to put down, did a speed-read through the first time, with a second (and third) at a more leisurely pace. Well worth the read and re-read. Makes you sorry that it's the last in the series but glad it leaves itself open to continuation at a future date. Gets you thinking about how you view the fables you grew up with and the tales you hear in the world today while making you wonder, what if....

0143036742|5.0|Just from reading the opening chapter, I got captivated like never before. Reading it further captivated me even more and the end of the book proved that it is an amazing story. A story in a story, A Short History of Tractors in Ukrainian captured the depth of characterization that produced an amazing octogenarian in love with a woman in her prime, a born survivor who is determined to make use of any advantage to secure a better future for her son; and the pragmatism of two conflicting sisters who are determined to 'rescue' their father. Enlightening, hilarious, gracious, gave and tender in turns, this fascinating story gives us an insightful view of the lives of those trying to make a new life as refugees or exiles.<br />I would recommend this book to any lover of good literary works. There are many lessons to learn from this book. Explored in a similar manner in The Lincoln Lawyer (Mickey Haller) and Triple Agent, Double Cross, it is a fascinating angle. I enjoyed reading this book, so if you are undecided, my advice is that you should pick it up and do some reading that you will remember afterwards as a worthwhile story.

B001HN697M|5.0|I love the Underworld movies. I didn't watch them until they had come on DVD almost a year later. It would have been awesome to see it in the movie theater, but alas it's a regret. However buying this movie on dvd hasn't been. I have seen it twice, and love every minute of it. It's tastfully done, with a brief background on the movies. I am glad most of the killed off cast came back to do this film it meant so much to me. The graphics are intense, and sure. Your gonna guess if what you saw is what you saw, and it's wonderful in detail. The characters are dancing beauitfully in the dialog. However with Sonja's character you really have to pay attention to what she is saying she is carful about her character and it's done beauitfully. The ending really is the beginning and you'll want to watch the whole franchise over and over again. It's just breath takingly awesome.

0439796644|5.0|Summary: This book takes place in 1914 during WWI and is written from the point of view of a horse named Joey.  Sold cheaply at an auction when he was just a colt, Joey joins the Narracott family.  The father drinks too much and is mean to the horses, but Albert, his thirteen year old son, immediately takes a liking to Joey.  When times get tough on the farm, Albert's dad sells Joey to Captain Nicholls as an army horse.  Albert is devastated and vows to find Joey and bring him home again.   And so Joey begins his journey, hoping he has the courage to face the many challenges of war.    My Reaction:  To say that I was moved by this book is an understatement.   The book stirred many emotions in me - sadness, anger, hope and happiness.  It was an emotional rollercoaster, but very much worth the ride!  It reminds me of Black Beauty, the classic novel by Anna Sewell, but it is a shorter read.   The vocabulary is very descriptive, which might be a challenge for some readers.  The novel sends a strong antiwar message.  Animal lovers will find themselves holding their breath while they read this book!
0553801473|5.0|Who would have thought I would have angered so many people with my initial review -- written about a third of the way through the book?  Here's what I wrote:<br /><br />I hate it when people write a review about a book they haven't finished.  Really.  And, yet, here I am.  So many negative reviews made me doubt the past two weeks when I reread the four earlier novels.  (Loved each of them.  Loved FEAST FOR CROWS much more the second time around.)  DANCE WITH DRAGONS definitely develops the story, moves us past A STORM OF SWORDS.  This is RICH story telling with lots of background, history, and detail.  Characters are developed.  AND plot moves forward.  Yes, as with FEAST there has yet to be any big moments, like the death of Eddard Stark, the Red Wedding, the fall of Winterfell, but, still, the story is gripping.  Reading DANCE in the immediate wake of the first four novels makes the newest novel so much better.  Yes, I still have lots to read.  But, I just had to contradict the negative reviews.  The book is very much worth the read.  Do not be daunted.  Better yet.  Reread what precedes DANCE and have a most remarkable reading experience.<br /><br />Now that I've finished, here's my response:<br /><br />First, I admitted to disliking writing an early review.  But I justified it.  There were simply too many negative reviews and, had I listened to them, I would have missed out on a remarkable reading experience.<br /><br />Second, it would behoove any reader to reread FEAST (or, better yet, the entire series) before reading DANCE.  Rereading allows the reader to identify all the character development and forward movement -- some of which is subtle -- that occurs in DANCE.<br /><br />Third, I loved this book.  Yes, I can agree with many aspects of the negative reviews:  Tyrion does lose his \\"zing,\\"  yes, Dany's chapter's go on a bit too long, and yes, all the single chapter POVs are a bit annoying.  And yet, Martin has moved his story forward.  Ending with far too many cliffhangers -- again, I agree! -- but the only reason I am hanging on that cliff is because the story is so darn good! As frustrating as the book could be at times -- it is LONG -- it was a remarkably rich reading experience.  This is elevated fiction.<br /><br />Fourth, I have a theory.  The next book will be out within two years.  Why?  It's all about money making.  Remember, Martin told us he had written a large portion of DANCE at the time FEAST was released.  He did NOT need six years to write DANCE.  But he did need the time to wait for HBO to give him the larger -- deserved -- audience he and his publishers wanted.  (Have you seen the bestseller lists lately?)  He sat on this.  Worked on the next volume.  And, now, we will see the final volumes released in a more timely manner.
1594744769|4.0|Got this on my kindle while on vacation.  Very enjoyable read...loved the pictures, thought they added a lot to the story.  Would recommend highly!
0553582038|2.0|Ok the overly wrought descriptions of everything make this book drag on and on and...well you get it.  I eagerly devoured the first three books and was so excited to get A Feast, but man is it disappointing. I find myself skimming through much of the Iron Island plot and sadly miss hearing more about Tyrion and Dany.  I understand Martin is trying to weave a rich tapestry of the different kingdoms and is gradually introducing us to all of the houses and their individual trials and tribulations but this book is often times boring and tedious. The journey or quest of these characters is tiresome and while the formula worked well for the last three books (partly I think, because the characters were likable and at times deplorable and Martin would hit you with three or four plot twists at a time) these characters and these journeys are annoying.  I can understand conceptually why he explains everything in such detail but it is starting to read like a text book.

0060930349|5.0|I love Paul Johnson's history and biography books.  They are as refreshing as they are rare in this age of history revisionism.  The negative reviews I read were all writen by liberals who are offended because the North wasn't given the same old false presentation in the Civil War chapters, the enviromentalist movement doesn't take and undeserved chapter, the socialist presidents aren't praised, etc.  There are plenty of books presenting history from a liberal perspective, so why complain about one which presents a different point of view?  Enjoy!
B0002IQNAG|5.0|\\"DAWN OF THE DEAD\\" will always have a place in my heart as a tremendous work (Not because of the cult following), but because it left an impression on me when I was 12 years of age. I realize that it may seem dated, but it holds a very important point...the undeniable despair of the 4 souls whose efforts at reclaiming a world that has become so changed...why bother? But it is their efforts which guide them and still, they are dramatically left to pursue whatever life has left for them as livelihood. Unfortunately, there are others who want to create their own superflous banter and hedonism which spoil their plans. What would you fight for? The moral of the story is to stay ALIVE..no matter what the cost! And this film shows a very \\"real\\" side of people, who react just as if they were \\"alive\\" and we are left to see how they destroy each other, especially in death.

0553386794|5.0|**I've read the five Game of Thrones novels in the last two months, just as a heads up, I have a solid over view, without the years in between**<br /><br />Outside of The Lord of the Rings novels, these are my only other venture into fantasy novels.<br />I wanted that to be known, so that other people not into fantasy novels aren't shied away from Game of Thrones.<br /><br />The story begins by introducing us to the main family, The Starks of the castle of Winterfell (one of the seven Kingdoms of the realm Westeros), most notably Eddard Stark,  a man with unshakable honor and integrity in a world where those words are little lived by.  He's trying to raise his family to hold true to those words.  The event that starts the story is the death of  \\"the hand of the king\\" (Chief of staff to the King) of the 7 kingdoms, and the king (an old and close friend of Eddard Stark) travels to Winterfell to ask Eddard Stark to become the new hand of the king.  From there the story really opens up to the other characters, politics, deceptions and intrigues, as there is something sinister developing in the 7 kingdoms, and something supernatural growing far in the north under the surface of everything.<br /><br />Game of Thrones is one of the most engaging reads I've ever had.  No character is safe, nothing is black and white, Heros do bad things and villains do heroic things.  Each character is thoughtfully layered, and Martin achieves something that is rare in any story,  that he actually makes you like the villains, (and keeps you guessing as to whom those are).  He also makes you question the heros.<br /><br />The book, to me, felt less like a fantasy epic, and more like a historical epic.  Martin creates the fantasy aspect of the story using a brush instead of a hammer, it comes in the form of mythology, through the characters, and when the fantasy elements appear in reality for the characters it feels real because the characters are in somewhat disbelief.  When a group of characters finds a dead \\"Dire Wolf\\" with cubs  (an ancient wolf that grows to the size of a bull)  in the forrest they are in disbelief, because they were said to have been gone for hundred of years.  So the fantasy is being revealed to the reader along with the characters, instead of  having to buy into the premise from the start that all these fantastical things exist.<br /><br />This book is an incredible page turner, and everything that unfolds made me feel like I'd earned something.  The characters, even the villains, you'll get attached to.  The stories hold weight, and meaning, and you never know who will live and who will die, because no character is safe and nothing is black and white.<br /><br />An excellently plotted, paced, and gripping novel\\"Dire Wolf\\" with cubs  (an ancient wolf that grows to the size of a bull)  in the forrest they are in disbelief, because they were said to have been gone for hundred of years.

B0036TGT3E|5.0|THE LION KING is far from another Disney Renaissance feature. It is truly the best animated film of its time. It's a movie in which all people can relate to and enjoy rather than just children, with tons of elements that are sure to bring the adults back. The movie takes a lot of risks that most animated films at the time refused to take, and executes them so well that it becomes an inspiration. Besides that, the movie exceeds on every single level of production. From the very enjoyable characters to the colorful and lively musical numbers, this film makes it look very simple to make a movie this amazing. There hasn't been a movie this well-made, and there will never be a film that is this well-made again. Not even Disney animated films that have come along since THE LION KING have been able to top it, especially POCHAHONTAS and HOME ON THE RANGE. Not even the most critically acclaimed of Pixar movies such as FINDING NEMO and TOY STORY are this sentiment. THE LION KING is a truly sentimental and memorable masterpiece.<br /><br />Rating: 5 stars/5 stars

B000B8QG4A|5.0|Lady and the Tramp is an amazing movie. It is one of the greatest things ever to happen in the world of movies. It even gave us a sequel that I like even more than this. But we aren't talking about that. My favorite character in this film is obviously Lady, because I find her voice and design to be cute and adorable. Tramp is obviously a likeable character because he is like Scamp from the second film. So, yeah, Lady and the Tramp is a masterpiece in every way. I really recommend it- it was a part of my childhood as well as #2.<br /><br />Rating: 5 stars/5 stars
B005DC68NI|5.0|The lists of resources and links to helpful sites alone are worth the price of the book. Gaughran practices what he preaches with a good looking ebook, links that work the way they're supposed to and a logical, easy to follow structure. Just having the book on the Kindle makes for a visual aid in how an ebook is supposed to look. Without resorting to wild claims or overblown promises, the book takes a look at the industry as it is right now and gives some hints about what may happen and then gives sound advice about how to keep up with a rapidly changing industry. The essays by 33 successful indie publishers don't offer much in the way of practical advice, but do offer boatloads of encouragement (along with leads to what sound like some interesting reads). Highly recommended.

0525423273|2.0|I had high hopes for this title, but it never as good as I hope it would have. This is a good start of a writing career, yet does not reach literary heights as the reviews claim. Some of the plot devices are obvious and the drama is silly, all of which pulled me out of the story. I realize that many people loved this book and were recommended this book from John Green.    If you loved the John Green books, this one is in the spirit of his books yet does not reach that level of art.

0553801473|3.0|I like George's first three novels and I was surprised when David Benioff and D. B. Weiss did such a masterful job of boiling novel one down into HBO's excellent series.<br /><br />I don't think Benioff and Weiss will have any trouble with Clash of Kings and Storm of Swords, except they really need at least 12 episodes for SoS.<br /><br />Maybe Benioff and Weiss can take FoC and ADwD and boil em down into a ripping yarn! A nice fix up is needed.<br /><br />Martin has his moments in Dragons, but where are the Dragons? (The allusions to the dance of those with or maybe with Dragon blood are all a-thrill... the real dragons , mostly off stage.)<br />The cliff hangers are becoming shaggy dog stories (and Shaggy Dog does not even appear in this novel!).<br /><br />George seems strangely distracted, marking time, not a wasted read , but kind of wheel spinner.<br /><br />Yes I am really curious what HBO is going to do with novels 4 and 5.

B003102JDM|2.0|A lot of the reviews I'm reading that heap praises upon this movie seem to run on a simple principle: the only way you can dislike this movie is if you lack the intelligence to understand it. I'd like to take issue with that implication.    I read once that human beings tend to see \\"faces\\" in things (for example, the 'Man in the Moon') given even the slightest pattern to work with. A lot of people seem to be trying their darndest to make this movie make sense, completely rejecting the possibility that it just isn't that good of a movie.     Ironically, the movie itself seems to demonstrate the idea that it describes: there is no reason for things to be what they are; if life is awful, it's just awful, and there is no inherent meaning in it all. Our protagonist suffers insult after insult, never learns anything, never takes initiative, and when he finally makes a decision - right at the end of the movie, with his eraser - he is suddenly informed that, yes, it can always get worse. Then the movie ends. That's it. The protagonist, like the viewer, has just sat through a long, meaningless, painful series of unrelated events, sticking it out in hopes that they will have something to show for it all when the curtain comes down. I sat for an hour and forty minutes, watched a sadistically slow and unengaging movie, and walked away feeling depressed and cheated.     To put this another way: If one were to assemble the greatest chefs, give them the best ingredients, and let them cook while being stoned out of their minds, you would get the culinary equivalent of this movie, and some people would insist that it was great food, even if it tasted horrible.     Just because it makes no sense, that doesn't make it great art.

The reward for winning the summer poker games is free drinks for a week. We both had read \\"The Secret\\" earlier in the year, and we both appeared to have good results. I had always heard about the wonders of quantum physics, and how it changed lives for the better ever since I saw \\"What the bleep do we know?\\". But a tragedy hit us two weeks ago thanks to this book.    Under the desire to win, Paul and I both thought our victories in our minds for days on end. We were confident that we would win. Problem was, we were playing against each other. Now I don't know how the universe deals with conflicting desires, but I'm confident that it performs what it needs to. And perform, the universe did. I am certain that as a result of our intense, conflicting desire, he disappeared.     Don't get me wrong, Paul is still here. But it's not him. See, I won this poker game. I got what I wished for, and The Universe gave it to me. But I believe that The Universe has created a parallel world in which the real Paul has been transported to in order to give him his desires. In this parallel world, Paul has won the poker game and I lost.     How do I know this? Simply put, Paul is not Paul. He's not himself. The moment I won, his attitude changed. He doesn't answer my calls and the bastard still owes me a weeks worth of free drinks. I've wished and desired my good friend back, but to no avail. The Universe gave me victory, but I also lost when it replaced Paul with a crappy replica.    At this point, I've given up on ever getting him back. The Universe can suck it, as far as I'm concerned. But if I could trust The Universe to answer my wants and needs, I wishfor my friend (the real Paul - whatever parallel world he may be in) to have a good replica of myself. Paul, if you read this, I hope that my parallel version was nice enough to spot you for a weeks worth of drinks. Good luck brother. I'll miss you.
B000SMWUPS|5.0|This little compartment is awesome! It provides a sturdy, handy place to store all the stuff that ends up in every Mom's hand: keys, cell phones, drinks, and more! It is especially helpful on strollers that don't have a built-in tray and it is designed to fit any stroller perfectly. It is a much better buy than similar products and the quality is outstanding. So worth every penny! Buy it now!

The icing was not difficult to make as long as you follow the directions. I added the raspberry juice and was SO delicious! The photos I took came out looking just like the pictured version and EVERYONE who saw them was amazed and made many positive comments. I would definately make this cake again and will try others very soon... there are some mistakes in this book but printed out the error sheet fromt he publisher and there was no issue and will be sent the corrected version when it is released in October. The size of the cake is just perfect !!!!!!

1936719010|5.0|I find that in average motivational books, the author ends up just telling you why or how you should go about doing something. Whereas Steven Pressfield actually TELLS you to do something. He doesn't beat around the bush. He has that wonderful voice in his writing that just seems to make you want to DO.<br /><br />In the Q&A description above, the author really shows how he has that \\"Do this, do that\\" tone that magically seems to drive a person to accomplish more. This is the exact kind of thing a parent might do to their child as they grow up. They would tell their young child firmly, but rationally, what to do. So when the child grows up to be an older child, he or she knows what to do in certain situations because they saw the direct result of what their parent told them.<br /><br />In this book, Pressfield shows the glory of actually doing the work without looking to correct yourself or look back with a critic's eye. He just wants you to storm through it and get something done. Something to show. I feel the majority of people don't do this. So if we could get everybody in the world to read this book, we would have a very advanced and productive society.<br /><br />I've loved every book I've read by Steven Pressfield. And would recommend this book as well as his other works. Such as his book [[ASIN:B00475AUWW The War Of Art: Winning the Inner Creative Battle]] Great for anyone who has artist's block. I know this helped me with my music writing.
B0052WKZZ6|1.0|Buyer beware!  This fourth installment from Mike Oldfield's reissue series has left this listener in complete dismay.  This is a complete botchery and an absolute slap in the face to avid surround sound listeners like myself.<br /><br />I was extremely excited to get a hold of a surround sound mix of Incantations, which really is my favorite Oldfield record.  However, the surround mixes, while fantastic, are mere excerpts of the entire piece, and include a bunch of other folky music that is not even included on the original album.<br /><br />I ask Universal UK and Mike Oldfield, why even release a surround mix if you can't provide the entire recording?  Why does the Main Menu say \\"Play Incantations\\", when infact it should say \\"Play Excerpts of Incantations and Other Tracks You Never Expected to Hear.\\" I was happy with my two LP set, and this is a clear downgrade.<br /><br />For those interested - here is what you get on the DVD.<br />. Diana<br />Northumbrian<br />Piano Improvisation<br />Hiawatha<br />Canon For Two Vibraphones<br />Guilty<br /><br />Also, three videos which include a live version of Incantations.<br /><br />Amazon needs to update their \\"review\\" which clearly mis-represents what comes on this Deluxe release.

IMO Best taken in small doses -- as in -- randomly mixed in with your other favorite tunes.

B000001EUR|3.0|Let me begin this review by stating that I am a HUGE fan of Scorpions. If you are someone wanting to check out Scorpions for the first time; however, I would urge you NOT to buy this album. Rather, I strongly encourage you to check out \\"Blackout\\" or \\"Lovedrive\\" first if you really want a taste of what the Scorpions are (were) about (at least in their popular incarnation).<br /><br />The \\"Blackout\\" album has far superior energy and better production than \\"L.A.F.S\\" and \\"Lovedrive\\" has much stronger songwriting PLUS the bonus of having Michael Schenker's inimitable presence. I was already a Scorpions' fan when \\"L.A.F.S.\\" was released and have fond memories of the excitement that surrounded the album and the sense that Scorpions were about to burst onto the world scene in the biggest way. Though I personally enjoy the album, I must admit that of all the Scorpions albums in my collection (and I do have them all), I probably listen to this one the least. Maybe its simply because the album contains most of their biggest hits and I'm being a bit of an anti-hits snob; more likely, its the sub-par production. Compared to their earlier works, the production seems muddled a bit; a strange phenomemon given the fact that this album was one of the first hard-rock records recorded using digital technology.<br /><br />I recommend eventually purchasing this album but only after you've checked out the aforementioned records from Scorpions popular catalogue. If you are seeking superior musicianship with a more progressive tendency, I suggest checking out Scorpions 70's era albums, \\"Intrance,\\" \\"Virgin Killer\\" and \\"Taken By Force\\" especially. Scorpions were virtually a different band between 1972 and 1978. Ulrich Roth's virtuoso guitar playing dominates all the early Scorpions records (minus \\"Lonesome Crow\\" which has a 16-year old Michael Schenker on lead guitar). When Roth and Scorpions parted ways in 1978, the band evolved into the more commercial entity that was to define them in the minds of most music fans.<br /><br />If you have loads of money to spend, go ahead and pick this up along with a couple of the other albums I've mentioned. If you're on a tight budget and don't want to waste money on a mediocre album, don't purchase this one.usic fans.     If you have loads of money to spend, go ahead and pick this up along with a couple of the other albums I've mentioned.

It takes a lot to shock me and this movie did just that all the way throughout.    As far as the price, I'm going to have to re-evaluate pre-ordering from Amazon.  Picked up the BestBuy Sunday flyer and the same blue-ray with digital copy was on sale for $10 less!
B0055B0MIO|3.0|Their most generic album to date. Simple riffs, predictable song setup with metalcore breakdowns and whatnot. There are a few standout songs nonetheless. But this album came as a bit of a disappointment to me. It's nothing in comparison to Shogun, or even Ascendancy for that matter.

Teen Moms complain about their  life, try to imagine giving birth to two babies without any understanding of what really is going on and then trying to raise those children in tents in the back yard. She seems to have overcome her stolen childhood with amazing results. This book is short and easy to read.

159562015X|5.0|This book makes so much sense.  I had to do go through this book as a part of an application and I am so glad I did.  It confirmed some of what I already felt were my strengths which increased my confidence in these areas.  It is affirming and encouraging to learn about one's natural abilities in order to invest in them more wisely.  This book enables people to focus on what they are good at instead of unfairly focusing on our weakness relative to the strengths of others around us.  It encourages you to embrace who you are and to be practical and honest with yourself when making career/life choices.  I totally recommend this book!
B004WJRFYE|5.0|Another amazing album from one of the greatest musicians ever! The photography that graces the album cover/insides and inserts by Linda McCartney bring back memories of studying them when I was a kid, listening to the album with my parents. A great nostalgic piece and a solid album to stand the test of time!
B003Y5H51K|3.0|Seems to be a lot of bad reviews about \\"nobody's\\" in this film.<br />Richard Roxburgh - Van Helsing, Mission Impossible II, Moulin Rouge<br />Ioan Gruffudd - Fantastic 4, Amazing Grace, W., Hornblower<br />Alice Parkinson - The Pacific, X-Men Wolverine, Where the Wild Things Are<br /><br />Household names they may not be to some, but nobody's, they are not and in truth, the director probably needed a few good, fit and flexible actors for this demanding movie.<br />It's tense, claustrophobic and well paced on the good side. On the bad side it's cliched and predictable. But no more so than a lot of movies about right now.<br />Anything with James Cameron's name attached to it is going to draw interest, and probably unreal expectations. Avatar this is not, nor even the caliber of The Abyss.<br /><br />All that said, this \\"inspired by true events\\" movie is worth seeing in my opinion. The character interactions, life and death scenarios and sheer palpable feel of the underwater scenes make it worth it.<br />Not a new story, cave diving team get trapped by weather, must go down and in, to get out. Unknown territory, virgin caves, cold, wet and the inevitable power struggles between high flying playboy (Gruffudd) and grizzled pro (Roxburgh), who's trying to save the team, and reconcile with his son keeps the story moving forward. Like I said it's cliched.<br />At 108 mins it feels about the right length, and whereas it's not a movie I would shell out to buy, or pump up to the 3D version (the 2D Blu Ray looked pretty good to me)It's worth a look. 3 stars

0553801473|2.0|I wanted to love this book.  I re-read the first four volumes of the series before it came out and went to several stores in vein hoping that it was released at midnight somewhere.  Unfortunately, I was for the most part bitterly disappointed.<br /><br />That's not to say its all bad.  There are really two books here.  The North (Jon, Theon, Bran, Davos, and Melisandre) and the East (Tyrion, Dany).  The former was terrific -- as good as anything in the rest of the series.  I found Jon's struggles to re-invent the Night's Watch to adjust to its new (really old) enemy, rather than the wildings, to be gripping.  Likewise, Theon's experiences as a prisoner of the Dreadfort were excruciating at times, but interesting nonetheless.  And as well written as anything from the first three books.  Bran and Mel give us some insight into the mysteries of Westros.  Davos is tasked to find a long-lost character.  If DwD were just these chapters, this is probably a 5 star review.  Maybe four stars, thanks to the soap opera-esque cliffhangers.<br /><br />Unfortunately, there were about 600 pages of utter drek that was Meereen. Seriously, its like somebody other than Martin wrote these chapters -- they are unquestionably 1 star quality.<br /><br />I have to assume that Dany was replaced by a faceless man -- because the incompetent, preening, sex-starved, simpering fool that was portrayed as the \\"Queen of Meereen\\" bore no resemblance to the character who marched her khalasar through a desert and had her dragons melt the faces off the Wise Masters of Astapor.  As if destroying her character wasn't enough, she was further undermined the by the revelation of a \\"new\\" character during Tyrion's chapters.<br /><br />Ah, Tyrion.  He was my second favorite character (next to Arya) through the first three books.  And I pretty much wanted to skip reading his chapters.  I could not care less about his Dances with Turtles, let alone the series of quite frankly boring events that have him transferred from the custody of one person to another.  His entire personality felt flat to me through the whole book.<br /><br />Finally, Jaime, Cercei, and Arya make brief appearances.  All three are pretty good, but there is no reason why they were not included in A Feast for Crows.  Indeed, these chapters could have been included at the expense of \\"Brienne's No Reservations,\\" and it would have improved that book as well.<br /><br />Taken as a whole, I would rate this as a 2.5 star book, since the bad takes up more room than the good.  But since Martin didn't really give us much of an ending -- choosing lame cliffhangers instead -- I'm rounding down to a 2.

1451629184|5.0|I felt such sadness for Jaycee Dugard when I read the first part of this book especially.  Her style of writing conveyed the emotion she felt --- fear, sadness, pain, loneliness --- after she was kidnapped by the very depraved Garrido's.  I don't know how she ever survived that considering she was only 11 years old when it all started.  But she not only survived, she thrived despite the awful things done to her by those sickos.  I saw Dugard's interviews on TV and read the People Magazine article, and I thought she was so strong and an amazing young woman.  I didn't understand the anger her mother expressed in the interviews until I read this book.  I'm a mother if that had happened to my daughter and I heard all the lurid details and suffering those monsters had put my daughter through, I'd have a hard time not being angry myself.  The amazing way Jaycee was able to convey her story in this book made how her mother feels clear to me.  I also think the book title \\"A Stolen Life\\" only speaks of the 18 years she was with those lunatics; she cannot get any of those lost years back, but the woman she turned out to be, the kind of mother she is to her children, and her deep drive to grow beyond her past to embrace today and tomorrow, shows that she is the victor here.  What the Garrido's did to her was awful, and I hope they're incarcerated in the \\"general population\\" but what Jaycee became despite all of it is the most remarkable thing about this story.  She should be very proud of herself, and I pray she continues to heal emotionally and grows on to live a prosperous and fulfilled life for many years to come.
0553801473|2.0|After the 5+ years it took GRRM to write this book, it's easily understandable that many readers had high expectations for Book 5 in the series of A Song of Ice & Fire. Granted, most high expectations are never met, leaving those who had them disappointed. I get all of that. But this book was a major disappointment. Although there were some redeeming chapters, and some great writing, for the most part, the book is one long, meandering tale that sees little to no development occur concerning the main story arcs. Cliffhangers from previous story lines are unresolved, yet a few new cliffhangers are (cheaply) forced upon the reader.<br /><br />I really hope GRRM makes a resounding comeback in the next book, otherwise this series, which had such a strong, promising start, may flounder into the realms of mediocre fantasy. That's if GRRM is actually able to finish the series before he dies, which, at his current pace, doesn't look likely.<br /><br />For fans of this series, do yourself a favor, and seriously lower your expectations. That will make the good parts shine brighter, and the bad parts not seem so poorly written.
0553801473|1.0|I can think of no word other than awful to describe this book. I've loved the previous books in the series in spite of many negative reviews but this was sham.<br /><br />The endless prattle about lineage and royal houses; The number of chapters decicated to a character only to have their story conclude in a small puff of smoke so insubsubstantial that it seems almost an aside.<br /><br />Rather than close storylines, the book actually opened new ones that just come about and then go out into the vacuum of space.<br /><br />I don't view Martin as an author gifted with clever prose; I read him for the story. Sorry to say that in this book there was none.

She looked all over trying to find the movie, but it is so old she couldn't find it. I told her I could find it for her on Amazon as she doesn't have a computer. She was very happy I found it for her and said she isen't loaning this one out to anyone but me, so I can watch it.

I started to read it and just could not put it down actually I just could not wait to get to read it again every day.My only concern is what am I going to read after I have read all of his books! I hope he will come out with new ones until then or I will find someone else with a similarly great style however he has a very unique talent!  I love his style he is not really Fantasy but neither Sci-Fi but somewhere on a thin line in between!  Recommend his books!
B004Y1USJE|4.0|As a lifelong YES fan I bought this as soon as it came out. I enjoyed the first listen-to quite a bit. I found that as I listened to it more and more it really grew on me. The arrangements are terrific and the production is amazing. I think having Trevor Horn around as producer really helped to add some refinement and polish to the album. I know (gasp) Jon Anderson is not on the album and it shows in the writing and, obviously, the singing. It's still YES though and through and Benoit David is a treat to listen to on vocals. My take on this album is BUY IT.

0670022411|2.0|I couldn't even finish this book.  Diana's behavior was maddeningly inconsistent--hating her witch heritage one minute, using her powers the next, then (incredibly) refusing to get any kind of training to use it once it is apparent that she MUST use it to save herself and her family!  So juvenile and irresponsible for someone who is supposed to be so intelligent.  Infuriating.    And Matthew.  Well, of course, like all vampires he's gorgeous and intelligent and rich and powerful.  Yawn.  And extremely possessive and uncompromising and selfish and controlling.  Double yawn.  Just not sexy or particularly interesting.     And the story itself.  Moving along usually at glacial speed until something mystical is suddenly revealed.  Another yawn, and I'm asleep and the book is on the floor never to be picked up again.

0061784788|1.0|Some of James Rollins early books were interesting and hard to put down, but not this one. I could not wait to get to the end of the book, which had an ending of no surprise. I was bored with the half baked characters. Some how it seems that some writers get to the point of just phoning in the book, instead of developing anything interesting. The book did not make me curious about any of the so called hidden secrets of the origin of USA or lost jewish indians. Not even spark of what if? Everything proposed was unbelievable. For example on page 370 Chin relates that seventy thousand years ago a volcano in Sumaatra blew up and wiped out most of the worlds humanity, down to a few thousand breeding pairs world wide. How would anyone know about this? This would be bigger news than the flood. I will not bother with James Rollins again.
0316056863|5.0|I love Tina Fey, but hesitated in reading her book.  I've found that, a lot of the time, people who are hilarious on tv/film/etc fail to impress when it comes to the written word.  Not so with Tina Fey.  The book is a comical autobiography of sorts, ranging from early childhood to 30 Rock, that is both insightful and often hilarious!  I'm happy to admit that my initial reservations were unfounded and stupid, and am confident that just about anyone would enjoy reading this book.
0385341679|5.0|I was a recent Moning Maniac, and had been reluctantly dragged into the hard-to-categorize Fever series. But once I did, I could not put it down. It is not typical in any way.    No spoilers here.     Don't read this book if you have not read the other Fever books. Read the Highlander books first if you haven't, and pay attention to the details. Read the Fever books in order. Allow yourself plenty of \\"me\\" time to read Shadowfever. Don't skip ahead. Don't read the ending first. Don't get ahead of yourself. Let it unfold for you.    This book was an amazing journey into urban fantasy, bordering on romance, and yet the most romantic book... Wow, how to describe JZB. We all want him, ladies.    I don't buy a lot of books in hardcover - but this is one of them. (I managed a bookstore for 19 years, and I bought a lot of books.) Buy this book. Support Ms Moning so that she might continue to write extraordinary novels such as these.
B0000VCZKW|5.0|In the tradition of ROCKY and REQUIEM FOR A HEAVYWEIGHT comes MATILDA (1978), the inspiring story of a pugilistic marsupial from Down Under who's granted one last shot at redemption by stepping into the ring and going a few rounds with the World Heavyweight Boxing Champion ( Larry Pennell ). Old pros Gould and Mitchum add class and a gritty urgency to this rousing, one-of-a-kind experience, so much so that MATILDA remains one of the greatest, most enduring boxing films ever made; think of it as RAGING BULL with a kangaroo.

B003O86FMW|2.0|In Hunger Games Collins developed believable and heroic characters. In Catching Fire the protagonist, Katniss, was a strong resourceful woman who showed great courage in volunteering to replace her sister in the games, which almost certainly meant death. Katniss demonstrated her intelligence and skill in not only surviving but also ensuring that her fiance, Peeta, also survived. In Catching Fire Katniss became a hysterical child, dependent on others for her and Peeta's survival and Peeta came across as a wimp. The only really likeable person in Catching Fire was Haymitch, who was little more than a drunk in Hunger Games.<br /><br />After reading Hunger Games I expected a book at least as exciting. Susan Collins showed a great deal on ingenuity in devising the tests the players had to survive in both books. But I hoped that in Catching Fire there would be a change of pace. I was disappointed. Catching Fire was, for the most part, Hunger Games revisited.<br /><br />I don't know if I will bother reading the third book.
B004VSTP4Y|2.0|A bad ending will ruin a whole series.  I feel jipped...  Out of my money...my time...my emotional investment.  Why would you do that to your readers who invest so much of themselves into reading these books? I dont know, just a little dissapointed.  The series as a whole was great, until I got slapped in the face by the biggest let down of an ending ever.  I should have taken the advice of some of the reviewers here and stopped after the first book, but I couldn't. I was too emotionally invested in these characters,... and I was robbed.
B003YL4LYI|2.0|I am a fan of the \\"Song of Ice and Fire\\" series, I even think \\"Feast for Crows\\" is a brilliant book; unfortunately I cannot say the same about \\"A Dance with Dragons\\". To be short: the fifth book in the series cannot be compared to the previous four. Sadly, I have to say, \\"A Dance with Dragons\\" kills almost all the forward momentum of the first four books :-(<br /><br />(The following sections contain spoilers, beware.)<br /><br />What's wrong with this book? Almost everything. First of all, it was a very bad idea to go back to the time of the events of \\"Feast for Crows\\". The first half of the book covers the same period as the \\"Feast for Crows\\". This part is simply boring. The second half of the book is more interesting but the events we are told about simply do not fit into the big picture. The worst part about \\"A Dance with Dragons\\" is that almost all the characters lost their wits and their behavior is simply stupid. Let's discuss some details.<br />- Daenerys - the change in her in the book is just nonsense, her decisions are simply stupid; the wise and compassionate future queen of Westeros became a gullible, hysterical, lazy and wanton girl. And Meereen is not interesting, it is simply annoying, all the characters we get to know in this city are selfish and disgusting, and anyway, who cares about the Slavers' Bay? Does it have any connections with the main story? It has none. At least, in the end Daenerys leaves this wretched city...<br />- Quentyn Martell - his story, for me, was the biggest mistake in the whole series. We read a lot about Dorne and the scheming of Doran Martell in the previous book. At the end of the previous book it was revealed that the big secret is that the prince of Dorne is sent to Daenerys. Wow, it could have been interesting... Major spoiler here: all this fuss about Dorne, the sand snakes, Arys Oakheart and so on, what is the result of all this? Quentyn dies without any result whatsoever, he and all the Dornish scheming achieved absolutely nothing! This part is really frustrating because why invest a lot into a detailed, and good story? Just to give an abrupt and stupid ending? I am not against killing off the characters, I was blown away by the Red Wedding, because it made sense, Quentin's story is simply unnecessary.<br />- Prince Aegon - did this new twist in the story add anything to the big picture? No, on the contrary. The more new characters we have, the more likely it becomes that a lot of side stories will not be wrapped up at the end. Are Aegon an his companions interesting characters? Unfortunately, the answer is no. Up until this fifth book Martin managed to avoid most of the fantasy clich&eacute;s, Aegon and his team is simply too bland, and mostly unnecessary and clich&eacute;d (the good but spoilt prince with his loyal and wise counselor is one of the biggest fantasy clich&eacute;). Was the story in such a dire need for another contender for the iron throne?<br /><br />I could continue with all the characters in the book, none of them moved forward. Even Tyrion, who is still the best character in the book, became shallow. And what about this girl dwarf? Really?<br /><br />Yes, I am angry with this book, because the first four books were masterpieces, this one is ordinary. I cannot give it more than two stars.

1401307787|4.0|This was the first book I read when I moved to San Francisco, in 1994.  I didn't have any money, so I read it chapter by chapter (or bits thereof) over a couple of weeks, at the bookstore.  I never did buy the book back then, and given its rather profound effect on me, I'm surprised on re-reading (the copy I recently bought) how little I remember;  basically the parable of the Chinese chef butchering an ox; and cleaning the kitchen to Bobby Ferrin's music--and I still can't stand his music.  I wasn't meditating in those days though, I was day dreaming.  From my teenage years spent laying down listening to LPs and daydreaming of my glamorous future, to my young adult years doing a variation of the same, \\"Be Here Now\\" did not describe my life, and by the time I ended up in San Francisco, in my mid-thirties, my future that had thus far materialized was not glamorous in the least, nor was any part of my past.  But, if nothing else, \\"Wherever You Go There You Are\\" drove its eponymous concept home, and suddenly I began to realize I needed to stop living in a dream world, and to start living my life.  I mostly succeeded, some of the time, some times better than others, and I was at least aware of how much time I still spent mindlessly, which was an improvement over being mindlessly mindless.<br /><br />So now, I've come back and read the whole book, cover to cover (okay, I skipped through the two chapters on parenting, as I don't have kids, and am unlikely to end up with any soon).  I'm still impressed with the book, but let me say right away, the way I read it back in 1994 was the way to do it:  Bit by bit, not cover to cover.  This is a reference book, a book you keep going back to, reading and re-reading chapters, or parts of chapters, to get a deeper understanding of what was said, or to tweak a suggestion for a meditation, or some other exercise you have questions about (most chapters end with a \\"Try\\" section, suggesting some meditation or awareness exercise related to the content of that chapter).<br /><br />What's nice about \\"Wherever You Go There You Are\\" is that it isn't full of New Age babble.  Jon Kabat-Zinn will occasionally go off on a generalization as if it's a scientific fact when usually it isn't, and may not even be a scientifically substantiated theory (do your atoms really rearrange through some form of meditation as one line suggests?  Really?), but for the most part he's not so keen on \\"New Age Thinking\\" either, and so keeps his narrative to the subject of Awareness, and Meditation.  There are parts of the book where he seems to contradict himself---and I'm still not clear on whether I should be trying various types of meditations---the lake, the mountain---or simply stay with the focus on the breath for a couple of years.  Years?  And when do you start bringing in concepts, like \\"what is my path\\" and how do you do that?  Just repeat the phrase over and over like a mantra, or say it once and let it float out there--and when it floats off, then what?<br /><br />So, the book hasn't been shelved with the other stuff I've read and might eventually re-read or thumb through for a factoid; it sits on the coffee table to be picked up and perused for insights on a daily basis, perhaps to help firm up a wavering commitment to meditation, or to help buck up my patience as I enter a meditative session.<br /><br />If you've read self help  books and \\"spiritual\\" books, and found yourself snickering at the psycho-babble and the beliefs presented as Universal Knowledge And Fact, but still haven't given up and are now considering meditation (but don't want to access it through a religion) I would happily urge you to give \\"Wherever You Go There You Are\\" a try.  I think you will be pleasantly surprised.

B004YXE438|5.0|This is one of the better puzzle games I have tried on my HTC EVO. The implementation is very good and I have played it for hours without any issues. The game basically makes mosaic pieces out of either the preloaded or your personal pictures stored on the device and mixes them up. At the start of each puzzle you can select how many pieces the puzzle will have and set the overall difficulty. You can rotate the pieces and drag them to their correct position to complete the puzzle. It also helps that the app puts a boarder around the picture so it is easy to find the edges and the corners.<br /><br />This is a good, fairly mindless game!<br /><br />Highly Recommended!<br /><br />CFH
6302859204|4.0|It was great to see this very well documented abduction case made into a movie. I thought that the part where Travis Walton was picked up by the UFO was very realistic, and well done. The part about people's reaction to his abduction was also (unfortunately) quite realistic and believable.  He appeared to have set off an automated defense system by going too close to the UFO. Many people who have intimate knowledge of this case think that Travis was dead, and was brought back to life by the aliens; this may explain the unusual length of his abduction.  The part depicting events on board the alien ship was not so good, and not in accordance with Travis's report, but I'd rate the movie 4 stars overall, in spite of this. I'm surprised that this movie did not create more of a stir with the general public than it did.
B0042816YK|3.0|I have loved everything Julia Roberts has been in, up to Eat Pray Love.  The story line is a common theme; Someone cheating in a marriage, feeling lost, needing to leaving it all behind to  find oneself.  Javier Bardem was great in the part, what a hottie. But Julia, She lacked something that I was looking for in her character.
B000YEUUCK|5.0|It was like being at the show itself.  You get the feeling of the width and the depth of the stage.  The sound was awesome and the video quality at its best. Would recommend this item to anyone who likes music.
0553801473|1.0|Where oh where to start.  I first picked up the series in 1997 and was blown away by Game of Thrones.  I was delighted by Martin's amazing balance of juggling a variety of viewpoints while building what seemed to be a living, breathing world all around them.  My delight grew into awe and then burgeoned into rapture by the time I read through A Clash of Kings and A Storm of Swords, because he managed to maintain a varied but limited cast and hop among them to highlight major developments while avoiding the lulls.<br /><br />After reading the stillbirth that was Feast and the nightsoil--one of the many new continuity-jarring words a variety of characters have inexplicably developed a fondness for--that is Dance, I am almost ready to give up hope on this series.  What a shame.<br /><br />Here are the major problems:<br />1)  characters seem to routinely ignore warning signs about which they became explicitly aware in previous books, in some cases going so far as to actively participate in muzzling the warning sign by their own hand WITHOUT EVEN A FLICKER OF RECOGNITION.<br />2)  the story seems to be moving along for the first half of the book, only to see it completely stall out in the second half.  Nothing happens in the second half that doesn't involve problem #1<br />3)  Martin is starting to write like Steven King, with long, drawn out trips to Irrelevant Lane where the narrative meanders pointlessly around dish #7239 or decorative scrollwork #1218.  The somewhat abbreviated meal descriptions of Game or Storm have now become chapters in their own right.<br />4)  there must be at least 30 points of view, which would be alright if they showed anything of consequence.  Unfortunately, they don't.  In fact, I'm still waiting for this problem to combine with problem #3 to give us the Rasher of Bacon viewpoint.  Don't laugh.  At this rate, it's almost 50/50.<br />5)  the long breaks between completion are starting to cause continuity problems.  Characters we've seen for3 books now constantly throw out phrases and words we've never seen before.  I wouldn't mind if words like \\"nuncle\\" or \\"serjeant\\" were regional, but when series-long familiar characters like Tyrion begin bandying them about, it's a serious problem.<br />6)  Martin's editor is apparently asleep at the wheel.  The book could have been half as long, twice as enjoyable to read, and still accomplished everything it does.  In fact, the worst thing about Dance is that the Martin of Game, Clash, or Storm could have told each character's entire story in Dance with 6 or fewer viewpoint chapters.  That is how little development and how much rushing around to do nothing takes place.  INEXCUSABLE for such a veteran.<br />7)  Feast and Dance really screwed things up storytelling wise.  There's still no way to skip ahead (which is why he wrote Feast and Dance in the first place), and now we're left with a host of shoddy, slapdash cliffhangers to clean up before we can even make any progress in Winds.<br /><br />The last two books were worse than irrelevant:  they actually weakened the series for all the above reasons.  Dance is an absolute shame, and I can only hope against the obvious that Martin realizes what a crap job he's done with the last two books and take to Winds with only 8 to 10 viewpoints to get some progress going again.  For now, this series is drek.
B000002KDS|5.0|After the groundbreaking release of Love it To Death, Bob Ezrin and the Alice Cooper Band turn in another classic piece of shock-rock entitled Killer. With this release, the band really comes into their own within defining the style of itself and the songwriting really goes up a notch from the previous Death set. Opening with the hard rock of Under My Wheels, the album gets things off to a raging start setting a tone that has all of the qualities of a classic AC tune. Horns are incorporated into this number and are arranged accordingly to give the band another outlet of inspiration in which to project their growing talents as a unit. Be My Lover continues the rock flow with a track that echoes a bit of white soul backing vocals meshed with a good time boogie riff that is, well, just a classic rock tune. Halo of Flies and the title track are the longer cuts of the disc and display the strength of the band musically, and are a bit more adventurous in their song projection. Ezrin worked very closely with the band (and Alice solo) well into the next decade peripherally, and would sometimes bring in session players if the others couldn't cut it. Rick Derringer played the solo on Under My Wheels, for example, and Dick Wagner would begin a session on School's Out playing lead on My Stars and from there would feature heavily on the next 2 releases because of Glen Buxton's gradual descent into alcohol which affected his playing and behavior within the band.     The other tracks that follow the lead of Be My Lover, in its straightforward rock appeal, are Yeah, Yeah, Yeah and You Drive Me Nervous, which round out the record and give it a fair balance of light and shade. Dead Babies would prove to be a controversial number to perform onstage as Alice would act out decapitating baby dolls' heads during the tune(once again, tongue planted firmly in cheek), yet provided another shock-rock number that remains a classic track. Desperado is a great number that begins with a picked out guitar progression and builds into a great outlaw-like tale that is colored by a string arrangement to give this track a bit of substance. Incidentally, the track was written as a tribute to an old L.A. acquaintance, one Jim Morrison, whom used to hang out with the band when they were trying to break through out west in the late 60's.     Overall, I find Killer to be a notch above Love it to Death and is certainly evidence as to why the Alice Cooper Band were quite a different kind of rock band within the industry, at that time. This is definitely an early shock-rock masterpiece. 5 stars
0385341679|5.0|If you haven't read the Fever series, you are seriously missing some wonderful books in your life. This series is FANTASTIC. She does such a great job writing them.

I'm not gonna put up any spoilers, but just read them.
B0050PYNOY|1.0|I viewed this because of Natalie Portman. What is she doing in this gross-out? What was she thinking? I will not own this. It is not my cuppa tea. As far as I am concerned it stinks like that dirty brown stuff it so closely resembles .
B001PJRAUS|1.0|I was looking forward to this Austen adventure. It sounded like a lot of fun, a girl from modern times switching places with Elizabeth Bennett. It was fun seeing Austen's world through the eyes of a \\"modern\\" girl. However, I thought they made Amanda a little too modern. I didn't care for her personiality or her bluntness. I thought she was a little to brash and could not see why any of the leading men (Mr. Bingley, Mr. Whickham and Mr. Darcy) would fall for her. I was disappointed in the changes made to certain characters, I didn't mind plot changes (which would happen if someone interferred the way Amanda did), but I was sad that some of the characters personalities were totally altered. Still trying to figure out how Mr. Whickham ends up being a good guy and Mr. Darcy the jerk? Georgiana and Caroline had massive character changes and Mr. Bingley is kind of a creep. I think Jane Austen would be disappointed in the changes that were made.
0439023513|5.0|I'm sort of appalled by the bad reviews people are giving this book. I thought this was one of the most beautiful endings to a series I have ever read, sad but it all made sense and her picking Peeta because he was the only one that could pull her out of the dark days was spot on. I felt drained and emotional after reading this but was not disappointed at all. Losing Finnick and Prim made me feel like I had lost someone important and you can't help but think, \\"why them?\\" but that's how it is in war there is no telling who is going to die and who is going to be left behind to endure the waves of grief. Suzanne Collins did an incredible job reminding us of the flaws we've made in history to help in not repeating the past.
B000059HB7|5.0|I couldn't even begin to calculate the number of times I've watched this movie (and I plan to watch it many times more).  It is one of my favorite westerns and one of my favorite John Wayne movies.  The casting might be a bit questionable, but that's my only complaint.  Otherwise, it's a great film with plenty of action and enough familiar faces to make it feel comfortable and memorable.  The pacing is perfect (it's over 2 hours but whips along so swiftly you'd swear that it was shorter).  I've always felt I could watch more of the same; they didn't have to stop there.  The action is first-rate; no one can enter a barn like John Wayne!  The dialog is fun.  Again, John Wayne knew how to deliver a line.  He managed to make a simple greeting, \\"good evening,\\" sound like a threat not to be taken lightly.  Of course, he was outgunned every step of the way by Walter Brennan who could deliver a line like no other, even when his character wasn't on screen; just a shout from the backroom.  With the aid of pros like Ward Bond and Claude Akins, how could they miss?  Well, there were those two bumps in the road: Dean Martin & Ricky Nelson.  What Wayne made effortless Dean Martin had to struggle with, trying too hard to be his role but ultimately failing because you can see him trying to act.  The only one who came off worse was Ricky Nelson, definitely out of his depth in a stiff overly mannered performance as a gun slinger.  A gun slinger for pity sake!  Whose bright idea was that?  And of course, with two singers on the payroll, Hawks was obliged to toss in a couple of songs at the oddest time.  Yeah, while under peril I've been known to give vent to a song or two.  Weird, but I liked that Walter Brennan joined in making it seem less manufactured.  Rounding out the cast was Angie Dickinson as a slinky, sultry, sassy woman with a dubious background.  She was no great beauty but she could project!  All in all, despite its few flaws, still a fantastic movie.  I'd give it a million stars if they'd let me.n stars if they'd let me.
B004PR71JC|5.0|It is a very good movie and the music is awesome! However, the Editorial Review on this site is all screwed up. I have seen the movie several times and although the characters are correct the rest is somewhat flawed. Definitely a movie worth watching and owning. Blue-Ray is best!!
B0020NH94A|5.0|This book was a gift to someone who recently had a stroke. He has told me that it was very informative, and that he wished he had had it before the stroke because he might have handled things differently. One example is that a person shouldn't go to sleep after having a stroke. I intend to read this book because, who knows? It could happen to any of us, and knowledge about a situation is better than going into it with a total lack of awareness.

1439153663|5.0|I think that this is a wonderful book. The characters are developed beautifully and I found myself emotionally tied to them in short order. It isn't the kind of book that you read for simple enjoyment. Though I did thoroughly enjoy it, and it has a lovely message, that message is presented in an unforgettable fashion that kept me thinking about it for quite some time after I had closed the last page. I can't recommend it highly enough.

B004VMVTNU|4.0|I really like many of the features this alarm offers (especially threw random song or playlist), but one feature is misleading. I assumed that the gps function would check to see if the phone was in motion before the alarm went off. Turns out that it takes two minutes of content motion to turn it off with no other obvious way to dismiss it. \n\nThis morning I left for work early and made a stop on my way in. while at that stop, my alarm went off that required me to move at 25 mph for at least two minutes. I couldn&apos;t shut it up without driving around for two minutes and had to listen to my alarm until I could get back in the car to leave.\n\nMaybe I did it wrong, but that just seems like an odd way to implement an otherwise great idea.

B001EN71CW|5.0|I had never heard of this program until it was mentioned on The Big Bang Theory by Sheldon (this is also a great TV show, especially if you are a geek, I'm not but I live with an old one).  Firefly has wonderful characters.  I loved seeing Ron Glass again after all these years since Barney Miller (one of the funniest TV comedies).  Firefly is a treat and so sad it only ran for one season.  I think it would be enjoyed by any age group.
B001N1DPDE|4.0|Great knife, heavy duty, I use it to split wood as well as other camp chores. Be warned though. The screws in the handle came loose on mine and I almost lost one. I fortunately located it near where I was using it to split kindling. I retighted the up, and used lock-thread when I got home. I was surprised that all the screws in the handle were so loose, compared to the rest of the quality of the knife. Other than that issue, this is a great outdoor/camping utility knife.
B0026J8LHM|5.0|Dream Theater's 18th, and most recent, album is \\"Black Clouds & Silver Linings\\". This album is another amazing entry in Dream Theater's catalogue, and should be in the collection of every hardcore Dream Theater fan.    \\"A NIGHTMARE TO REMEMBER\\"    16:10 of pure awesomeness. One of Dream Theater's absolute best.    \\"A RITE OF PASSAGE\\"    Way too awesome for me to find the right descriptive words.    \\"WITHER\\"    This was another song that instantly became a favorite when I heard it for the first time.    \\"THE SHATTERED FORTRESS\\": X. RESTRAINT / XI. RECEIVE / XII. RESPONSIBLE    This track concludes Mike Portnoy's 12-Step Suite, with the song's 3 parts being the final 3 steps in the 12 Steps to Recovering from Alcoholism. I loved the whole idea of Dream Theater including one entry on each album:    Starting with \\"The Glass Prison\\" (featuring steps 1-3) on \\"Six Degrees Of Inner Turbulence\\" (2002). \\"This Dying Soul\\" (featuring steps 4-5) on \\"Train Of Thought\\" (2003). \\"The Root Of All Evil\\" (featuring steps 6-7) on \\"Octavarium\\". \\"Repentance\\" (featuring steps 8-9) on \\"Systematic Chaos\\" (2007), and ending \\"The Shattered Fortress\\" (featuring steps 10-12) on this here album, \\"Black Clouds & Silver Linings\\" (2009).    \\"THE BEST OF TIMES\\"    This amazing track was written by Mike Portnoy, in rememberence of his late father, Mr. Howard Portnoy, God Rest. Such a heartfelt song that, admittingly, brings a few tears to my eyes.    \\"THE COUNT OF TUSCANY\\"    Such an awesome song. I couldn't have picked a better song to close this album.    This album is another one of Dream Theater's best. All Dream Theater fans should already have it in their collection.    NOTE: Sadly, this album is the last to be recorded with ... (Drummer) Mike Portnoy, who left the band on September 8, 2010. Mike was one of the 3 founding members of Dream Theater. He had formed Dream Theater with (Bassist) John Myung & (Guitarist) John Petrucci, while they were all students at Berklee's University of Music in Boston, way back in 1985, while I was only a newborn at the time.    Having Mike leave Dream Theater was very devastating to all of us Dream Theater fans. But, as the song says, \\"The Spirit Carries On\\". Mike will always be remembered. I really wish Mike the very, very best of luck with his new band, ADRENALINE MOB. We love & miss ya, Mike.
B0057A6GA6|5.0|I have quite a few tower defense games, and this is my absolute favorite. The levels are challenging and you actually have to think about your tower placement. At times it can get confusing at the beginning of the level as to where the first wave is going to come from.
B0044XV3R8|5.0|It was worth the wait and few extra $$ to get the extended release of \\"Avatar\\".  Even though it's still playing on cable now, I won't watch the theatrical version since I have the extra footage, which, in my humble, makes all the difference in this already amazing movie!  TWENTY thumbs up!!
B0017SWPXY|4.0|I did not really want to read this book but my f2f book group chose it. Life from the perspective of an anthropomorphic dog, did not capture my imagination, but I can see now that I have begun it, that it could just as easily be a reflection of man's thoughts as well, and I am reading it with a different eye.<br />I find that I am not that interested in the car racing side of the story because it seems too contrived for the dog to be engaging in many of the thought processes with his owner. It is easier to relate to the human relationships, regarding basic feelings and emotions, because I can relate to those more easily than to Nascar. However, that said, the simple rules revealed in the anecdotes about the racetrack, about managing life's situations and challenges, are illuminating for us humans as well as for Enzo, the star dog of the novel. It is through the animal that human experience is being examined, and it is a unique avenue to travel.<br />Although the story is written, a bit tongue in cheek, since you have to suspend disbelief while you read it thinking of a dog who can both think and reason, who believes he will be reincarnated as a man, it is also written with humor and sorrow, exploring the happiness and pain that constitutes our lives.<br />Through the dog, we experience some very real emotions. The dog has a knack for explaining the mundane situations in our lives as well as our everyday reactions in a very simplistic, yet thoughtful and enlightening way. The basic truths about relationships are explored thoroughly with the examination of the dog's thoughts.<br />The book begins with Enzo contemplating euthanasia to end his misery and then delves into his thought processes and experiences from puppyhood to the present, from Denny's marriage to Eve and the birth of Zoe to Eve's eventual illness and death. Through these short chapters, which open a window into his thoughts, we learn about what makes all of us tick: our fears, our hopes, our dreams, our concerns.<br />When Enzo thinks about his desire to be euthanized for various reasons (not wanting to be a burden, not wanting to be helpless), and is no longer sure it is the best idea, we are forced to stop and consider that thought more fully. I thought of a friend who recently died from Cancer. She too had thought she had enough of her suffering and wanted it to be over. Hospice was called in and treatment stopped. In the end, very near death, she said to me, \\"Oh, I thought it would be easier, it is so hard! I don't want to disappear!\\" It broke my heart because I could do nothing, and in this book we learn that the only thing we can offer is comfort, to those in need. The rest will take care of itself. Ultimately, those who remain, need to take care of themselves.<br />This little book which I thought was going to be a trivial story, turned into one, for me, that uncovered profound images and memories and opened my mind to new ideas about how we live and how we die and to what base level an ordinary human being will sink to accomplish a goal or satisfy a selfish need.Enzo thinks about his desire to be euthanized for various reasons (not wanting to be a burden, not wanting to be helpless), and is no longer sure it is the best idea, we are forced to stop and consider that thought more fully.

1416550534|5.0|I loved loved loved this book.  I have fallen in love with Kate Morton's writings.  She weaves a beautiful story entangled with mystery and intrigue while leading up to a unforgetful ending.  She keeps you turning the pages and not wanting to finish but not wanting to wait to see what happens either.  You will feel you personally know the characters in her books because she brings all of their feelings out in the open. You will almost feel she is talking directly to you personally.  I look forward to more books written by Kate and hopefully soon.
B0055SWM08|5.0|Great game with beautiful graphics, a non-obtrusive soundtrack, and a well-paced progression of difficulty. Highly recommend it! Sprint Evo 4-G.
B0055SWM08|5.0|Quell is a beautifully-designed casual game. The artwork, music, animation, and user interaction work together seamlessly to create an inviting, casual atmosphere. The experience is well thought out, and \\"clicks\\" while you're playing. The gameplay itself uses a standard formula (you control a \\"raindrop\\" that can move in any of four directions until it hits a wall or obstacle), but introduces new complexities at a steady pace. Level design is good -- most levels are solvable without too much trouble, though achieving a perfect solution requires additional thought, and the game lets you know if you've made an incorrect move from which you can't recover. The control scheme is intuitive and effective, and the gameplay elements (feedback, achievements) fit in smoothly. Overall, an impressive and fun game; I hope to see more from this developer!
B003LZJI86|5.0|Que te puedo decir que ya no sepas, son la mejor banda del planeta, si eres fan seguramente ya tienes este dvd o el BR y si no eres fan pues te lo recomiendo por que no hay banda mas premiada que ellos no hay banda con mas giras vendidas en su totalidad que ellos y si estás deprimido solo bon jovi te devuelve el ánimo aunque si quieres seguir deprimido tambien tiene canciones si eres masoquista.

0345529057|5.0|I just finished A clash of kings and I love it. A song of Ice and Fire is a masterpiece
B005CLT86E|5.0|I had a feeling I needed this album the very morning it was released.    I just finished listening to Skying for the first time and I love it. It's as though the promise of The Horror's previous album, Primary Colours, has been delivered. Primary Colours was initially a difficult album for me to get into because it was such a departure from the raw in-your-face, we-don't-care-what-you-think punk attitude of Strange House, their debut album. Primary Colours wasn't a bad album at all- quite good actually- it was just unexpected. I was momentarily hampered by my own expectations of what The Horrors sound like, so I didn't expect The Horrors to produce something so polished, so mature.     Skying continues this high level of production and it's a force to be recognized. It starts out dreamy but with a progressive pace and seamlessly flows through each new song, spinning a hypnotic halcyon aural tale from beginning to end. Reminiscent of good English rock from the 80s when Britannia ruled the FM airwaves and MTV, Skying not only delivers but brings me to a very happy, serene place.     Expect this album to end up on many \\"Best of 2011\\" lists at the end of the year.
B003J7HOKU|5.0|I don't even know how to being to explain the awesomeness of this album. This is definitely unlike anything I've ever heard. I was a fan of the song \\"Carrion.\\" So I figured I would buy this CD and see if I liked it. Oh man! I was not disappointed. The music is so heavy and authentic. There is nothing like them around right now. I love this band and this album. I recommend this to any metal lover.
0385341679|5.0|I couldn't put any of the 'fever' books down! In fact, I work for a bookstore, and by the time I was done with the first book, I had a ton of my customers and all the girls I work with reading it!<br /><br />To me, the whole series reads a lot more like sci fi than romance, and I LOVED it!
1452101248|5.0|This is a sensational new cookbook but Amazon cannot give you a ship date which makes it very difficult to give as a gift!
B00197YZ7M|5.0|A wonderful love story in a beautiful setting..........the covered bridges are incredible and not everyday seen by the world.  The story stays alive, past and present with excerpts from those few days that changed the life of two people for just this short time, but yet remained alive in their memories forever.  It was not until after they had both passed this life that the children, now adults, began to unveil what those few days meant to both their mother and the photographer from National Geographic Magazine.  Excellent performances and love story.....

0316056863|3.0|I am a huge fan of Tina Fey, and one of the main reasons is because her strong political views come out in her comedic acting.  As I read through this book, a couple of things struck me.  It was like a book of two halves.  The first half of the book was very funny and entertaining.  I caught myself laughing out loud almost every other page.  But in the second half of the book, the entire tone changed.  She seemed to get a bit more serious, and in particular, became almost apologetic about her impersonations of Sarah Palin that have made her so famous.  Part of the reasons those impersonations were so funny was because there was an underlying assumption, based on Tina's past commentaries, that she was diametrically opposed to all of Palin's political views.  But, in the book, she claims she was very reluctant to portray Palin and was almost cornered into the role.  Secondly, the last couple chapters seemed as if they were written, not for us the readers, but for herself.  It reminded me of a journal entry someone writes for their own eyes to help them solve an internal dilemma (in this case, whether to have another child, how much to work and how much to be at home).  I didn't really feel it had a place in the book.    However, I did find the references to sexism in comedic acting to be quite informative.  When she speaks about how the Second City groups had more men than women because they felt there weren't as many roles for women--she made a great point that, hey, it's improv and the roles can be whatever the actors create.  I also like how she tied this in to a shift in SNL when the main actors became the females and the funniest recurring roles were played by females.    One other thing--was it just me, or was the glaring omission of many references to her mother (in contrast to a whole chapter about her father) kind of awkward in the way it appears to indicate a problem with their relationship?
B001UV4XJ2|2.0|What's the big deal? A nearly mute, deer-in-the-halogen-lights protagonist with no charisma and no leadership qualities. He's supposed to be a beloved wizard, and tons of people get whacked or nearly whacked because of him, yet he has nothing to say to them nor vice versa as he strides through scenes of destruction. Multiple confrontations between the goodies and baddies in which almost no feeling is expressed. (I watched the movie with a Potter enthusiast, who tried to explain to me that the British tend to keep their emotions suppressed. Ahem.) Potter saves his rival in a perfunctory fashion, but there seems to be no emotional involvement by either party. And there you have the horcrux of the movie's problems: it's emotionally hollow in so many places. Perhaps the director was worried foremost about how the CG would play out. Perhaps nobody in charge really gave a hoot about how characters should react to such extraordinary circumstances.    On the plus side, the special FX are quite acceptable, and the bankers really look like they should be working for Goldman Sachs.
B005CDTGDC|4.0|Very enjoyable listen to the author read his book. Overall: a good, not great book, but well worth the time to listen. Recommended.
B004Y1USJE|1.0|I'm with the nay-sayers.     Back in 1980, \\"Fly From Here\\" was a weak Buggles track rejected by Yes for inclusion in Drama. There are a couple of concert performances available where this is evident (The Word is Live). It was fluff pop then and has hardly fared better since. Therefore, the idea of exhuming this throwaway tune (31 years later!) and then extending it into a 20 minute 'suite' is nothing short of shocking. Could Yes really be so utterly bereft of ideas? (What do these guys do in their spare time??)     Like the title track, most of the album is facile pop, not too distant from the stinker that was Open Your Eyes. Heck, maybe Benoit should have written the music.     I was hopeful when I heard Horn would produce; you know, some risk-taking, a new vision, a daring approach, or the splash of inventiveness that injected fire into 90125. Nah, this could be anyone at the knobs. Horn would seem to have been seriously overtaken by the new generation of producers. His work here is merely undistinguished.     And to think that 30 years ago I thought these blokes would be writing wicked classical music by now. Ha!
B004WPYNY8|5.0|After the Odyssey came out, I didn't think it could be topped.  Then came Paradise Lost!  Once again, I didn't think it could be topped.  All I can say is, I can't wait to hear what they do next!  Saw them live 2 months ago, and they pulled it off live too!!  One of my favorite Prog Rock bands!!
0553801473|2.0|I am so grateful to George R.R. Martin for his first three books.They are wonderful to read. My only experiance with fantasy fiction has been the \\"Hobbit\\" series. I think maybe its my own personal taste but after reading thousands of pages I became so tired of nothing being resolved. Even characters I loved, I became impatient with. How many times can Arya be abducted by one group or another? Is Tyrion just insane? Is it possable that Daenerys is just not very bright? This fifth book is still beautifully written, but I just felt impatient and annoyed by it. I will probably not purchase the next book, but I'm still grateful for the first three.
B0059R5Q08|5.0|I have been a Jane Austen fan for most of my adult life but have only just found(or rather, picked up) the story of Jane Eyre. Perhaps if this had not been my first foray into her story, it would not have touched me so well as other versions have for other fans. The dark and spooky feel the story had, the balance of willful and subservient way Mia portrays Jane so amazingly, and definitely the brooding and sexy quality of the leading man. I loved every minute of the movie and wish it had been longer. I watched it twice and will do so again before the 24 hour timer on my rental runs out. I hope they make a director's cut available, at which point I will purchase it again! Until then I will content myself with the dvd. This one's a keeper.<br /><br />Edit: After mulling it over for a day I understand others issues with the end of the movie.  It does come about rather quickly and would have been better with a little longer resolution.  I still love the movie and will own it on release day.  Crossing my fingers for a director's cut....
B000WCDI64|5.0|This was a fantastic 2007 concert by the late Amy Winehouse. She gives one excellent performance and shows the amazing true vocal talent she had.  Filmed in her home town, her Dad and step-Mom and Husband were in the audience and Amy was feeling it. I read some reviews on this DVD that say it's sad to watch this because she was drunk, slurred her words and was out of control. Nothing can be farther from the truth! in between songs Amy talks and jokes with the audience, she talks in a low voice and many misconstrueded she was slurring her words, in the 5.1 mix you can her her spoken words much better. Amy slips some wine through the show but she is in full control here and gives a command performance! The only bad thing through the show is her voice does give a tad, she even admits it but continues on and fires through the numbers. This DVD has her biggist hit \\"Valerie\\" (Number 2 in the UK) along with \\"Rehab\\", \\"Black to Black\\", \\"Love is a losing Game\\" and more. Filmed in a small but very plush concert hall that has a feel to royalty about it, the cameras have great close ups all through the evening, a truly great filmed event!
0375846735|4.0|The Amber spyglass if the last of the three books by Philip Pullman on his Dark Matter series, that starts with The \\"Golden Compass\\", then the second book is \\"The Subtle Knife\\".   The Amber spyglass has every bit the action of the Golden compass, and if you are the kind who hates knowing where the author is going to go with his next action, You will love this one.    Phillip Pullman has side stepped the expected outcomes each and every time, and in my opinion leaves the reader a bit behind as he does so. The ending is a bit weak, as the activities of the Physicist from Earth who is said to play the role of the Serpent to the new Adam and Eve, never really does this that I could ever tell, and leaving it where Lyra and Will may not ever see each other after the end of this book is just cruel to your heart strings. We find ourselves falling in love with them as they fall in love with each other, and it is easy to figure that THIS will be the start of a whole new \\"Genesis\\", when Philip throws a monkey wrench to our heads and makes Will and Lyra part as soon as they hit the age where Love counts, Where they have just discovered it, and  leaving them where they will never be able to see each other again   I loved the journey, even with the very unsatisfying ending. The books are still worth the read and will get a re-read from me as well.
B000PKG7I4|5.0|Although I like and own both CD's, I definitely like this one the best.  I was raised on the same kind of music that Amy was, and when listening to this one, I can close my eyes and literally FEEL the music of the Big Band/Jazz era.  Amy is absolutely awesome, with a voice like pure honey edged with just enough of a dash of cayenne pepper to make her music spellbinding (and powerful).  If my Dad were still alive, I would've bought this for him as a gift and he would've absolutely loved it - he was an absolute conoisseur on great BB/R&B/Jazz.<br /><br />Amy was such an incredible talent.  I have a bad feeling that it's going to be a loooong time before anyone else will be able to even look at her shoes, let alone step into them.<br /><br />Rest in peace, Amy - you will be sorely missed.
B003L77TZI|5.0|I am a dyed in the wool metalhead, but something about Katy's music caught my attention, and this has become hands down my favorite album.  I love every single song on here, and after listening to it multiple times every day for seven months, I am STILL not sick of these catchy, sing-along-with-every-word kinda tunes. I can't remember the last time i bought an album and actually listened to the whole thing more than once, much less learned every single song by heart.  If you even slightly think you'll like this cd, BUY IT.  it rules.
B0054JZC6E|1.0|this app has caused my phone to not send messages, gives me phone errors, as well as most of the games can&apos;t be played as described. the touch part of the game needs to be updated.
4770031246|3.0|The contents of this book were a bit disappointing to me and now that I have it, I've looked into others that have more and better suggestions for making bento box lunches.
0425241505|5.0|This one stole my attention and I could not put it down!  The writing was great, very fun to read.  The Other World was superb, can't wait to find out more about it.  Little redundancy in this one, said it once, moved the story along. Twists and turns, some unexpected surprises, some predictability too.     I loved the characters and how they interacted with each other.  They were well developed and easy to connect to.  Lots of laugh out loud moments, Pia's sense of humor was splendid.  Dragos was a wonderful character, very much the brute, loved watching him stumble along the `love' path.  The supporting characters are a win, too.      The plot was great, complicted enough without needing a graph to keep it all straight, and layed lots of groud work for future installments.  One little penny has created quite an empire of stories.  I will be reading future installments; I will be reading this one again!    5 Stars: Thoroughly Entertaining
B0055SWM08|5.0|Soothing music and a challenging but relaxing game. no squawking animals, no flashing bright colors. just a nice puzzle game.
B003VYAX2W|5.0|This band does not disappoint. The album is great, Volbeat has made 4 albums and all are great... This album seems a bit more refind... Fallen has gotten national air play...  The Mirror And The Ripper, 7 shots, thanks, all are great... Of course I listen to the album from beginning to end every time... can't wait till album 5 comes out
B00000GAIW|5.0|All the great Tull songs from days gone by.  Brings back good memories while listening to their musical magestry.
B002JVWQT6|5.0|This show is one of the most brilliantly written and easily accessible to the general public. Every episode is absolutely hilarious and relevant to everyday life in some way. Each character is perfect. Now, the lifestyles and quality of living of each of these families may not necessarily match up with your life but the show manages to address even the most minute differences and imperfections found in any worthy relationship. I guarantee you'll be saying, \\"I've done that!\\" or something similar multiple times throughout the series.<br /><br />The Blu-ray is a great deal and there are some terrific bonus features that are very interesting if you are so inclined. What \\"Seinfeld\\" did for adults, \\"Modern Family\\" will do for adults and children. Highly recommend!
B004DK5CW4|4.0|This is a light heartwarming family film based on the true story of the racehorse Secretariat. It is a little overly sentimental at times but it's hard not to find yourself inwardly (or outwardly) cheering every time the horse triumphs against the odds. The press conferences between racehorse owners had a Rocky 4 feel about them and I'm curious as to whether or not such things actually took place back then.  Anyway the film has a fine cast and it's great to see Diane Lane getting such a good part. She holds the film together well and is admirably supported by John Malcovich who gets most of the amusing lines.   Very watchable.
B002ZG976U|4.0|So the movie has a lousy predictable plot and lots of cliches, I love Cher and Christina and what they can do with a song!  Loved the costumes and the musical numbers so well worth the price and something I can watch many times over.
B004Y1USV2|3.0|Sounds like Yes ? Yes....  thus the three stars.   Songs are not catchy, Jon Anderson definitely missing . Disappointing song content-no hooks. Very light in the melody department.
B004TSKKF4|3.0|I usually love to read Nicholas Sparks books, but this one was really disappointing. I can't believe it myself, but the movie was better than the book..
1597801585|5.0|Very simply, if you admire the work of Harlan Ellison, William Gibson, or Philip K. Dick, then you may find this work insightful, entertaining, and inspiring.  Written with a great respect and feel for the characters involved.  I look forward to the authors next effort.
B0052VUNHC|5.0|I was a bit held back by the book's cover, but once I started reading it I couldn't put it down. There were some Clichés, but I enjoyed them as well. Made me laugh out loud couple time :) Anyway, I just finished it and started it again!
B000UBMWG4|5.0|I was pretty much blown away by the picture quality on this BD.  This remaster should be the benchmark for any older movie HD transfer.  Great PQ, great sound, multiple versions and extras.  If you're on the fence for picking this up or even re-buying to upgrade from standard DVD - hesitate no longer.  This is a must have for any BD collection.
0316017930|5.0|Lots of good information written in a compelling manner that made you want to turn the page.  I love books where you learn something and can also enjoy the reading of them.  This was that book.

0307595862|5.0|The book is excellent. Nesbo's writing is so addictive that I read 5 books is 7 days!!<br />I liked SNOWMAN the best, even better than the much acclaimed Leopard...
B0043T50CC|3.0|To be clear, the song \\"All Gone\\" is not, as inferred in the review above, a composition of Nicola Conte's.<br />It's a direct cover of the John Dankworth composition by the same name, from the Harold Pinter directed 1963 movie \\"The Servant.\\" Harold Pinter also wrote the lyrics to the song. It was originally sung by Cleo Laine (and sadly still unavailable in digital form).
B0055OK2T0|1.0|i keep waiting for him to quote stalin and it throws me off his characters.  at least we got the bourne movies before he went crazy.
B004YEJGEO|5.0|This is one of the best puzzle games I have ever played. It is very addicting. Reminds me of an old computer game that I played as a kid. I look forward to trying to beat my scores once I finish the game and hope more puzzle games of this quality are released in the future. I got it as AOTD and would gladly pay 99 cents to play this.
B004ULNJF8|3.0|\\"I've got a name, Blitz as in Blitzkreig.\\" After a serial killer starts killing cops Tom Brant (Statham) begins to investigate. It is up to him to find and stop the killer before he strikes again. I will start by saying that I am a big Jason Statham fan, even though he plays the same guy in the same movie every time. This one is no different. Statham is the tough guy cop who plays be his own rules and gets what he wants. The one thing I will say about him is that he knows his limits and likes to stay in his comfort zone. That is not really a bad thing. This is a British crime drama and without a \\"Hollywood\\" feel it works and is entertaining. Nothing new or different in this movie but it is still very much worth watching. Overall, if you have seen one Statham movie you have seen them all. But no one can watch just one. I liked it. I give it a B.<br /><br />Would I watch again? - I doubt it.<br /><br />*Also try - Giallo & Righteous Kill
B004EBT5CU|5.0|If I had to choose only 1 CD to buy this year, this would be it.  I can't stop playing it.  What a talent!  Love, love every cut on this CD.  Bravo Adele.
0553801473|2.0|I've read All of GRRM's books.  The first 3 were very good.  But a Dance with Dragons and Feast for Crows have left me with a feeling of loss.  I figure I'm already heavily invested in reading this 7 book series, so I read a Dance with Dragons.  I think a lot of people feel the same about being heavily invested in finishing the series.  Reading this book was like doing homework.  You just slug through it.  The good thing about this being an Amazon best seller is every library will have a copy of the book.  I recommend don't waste your money on buying this book.  Read it for free from the library.  Even if you have to wait for the library book to become available, you're not missing much, and the next book won't be out for another 5 years anyway.
B004OKFIYU|5.0|Love this SACD version.  I am playing the heck out of it.  It even sounds good in my car CD player.  You gotta get this one.  Nice job!
0439023491|4.0|I wasn't sure what to expect in the second book in this series, Catching Fire, becuase the first, The Hunger Games, could have stood by itself.  And I didn't think anything could top The Hunger Games.  Unfortunately, Catching Fire didn't top The Hunger Games.<br /><br />In fact Catching Fire became repetitious, and it seemed like the author was simply trying to cash in on the success of The Hunger Games.<br /><br />BUT - the final book in the series was excellent.  And the only way to get to the final book, Mockingjay, is to read Catching Fire.  Standing alone, I would have given Catching Fire two to three stars, but because the author does a good job of tying in Catching Fire to the finale, the book is well worth reading.
B0018QOIXU|5.0|Got there in time in great condition! Wonderful CD! Adele is amazing! Would buy from again! Sorry for the late review!
0439023513|5.0|Suzanne Collins brings back the excitement and wonderful pacing first seen in The Hunger Games.  Her character development is supurb, and her writing style is simple and powerful.  This is one of those books you DO NOT WANT TO END, and when it does, you really feel like you're going to miss the characters.  My only complaint is that the book isn't longer, and that the epilogue feels a bit like an afterthought (I felt the same way at the end of the Harry Potter series).    Mockingjay does a good job tying together the loose ends and resolves some of the bigger issues.  The social commentary, lacking in the first two books, comes through more, and the reader is given a larger glimpse into what might have happened to create the dystopian world depicted.      Some reviewers have commented on how cold the protagonist, Katniss, seems throughout the series.  What Collins does, in my opinion, is make a strong female lead who doesn't rely on looks, money or fame.  Katniss is honest about lacking self confidence and wonders openly about how anyone could like her.  To me she is a true \\"everyman\\" character, representing how MOST people feel at the age of 17.  Her emotional growth throughout the books is sly and understated - leaving the reader to look back of the three books to see just when and how it happened.
007174889X|5.0|I love these books!!! First of all, they are beautiful! The pages don't seem to be as shiny as the previous edition, which is always a plus if you study under lamp light. Tons of illustrations, photographs and charts. The ink on a couple of pages does seem to be a little off, but nothing major. I've only just started using them but from what I've seen so far it is awesome. Latest classifications and diagnostic criteria for diseases like RA. Also the dvd seems to be very useful. I've only gone through the neurology exam, but it seems to be a high quality video with important information. I think these books are worth it, especially for the price!
B000V4UFZK|5.0|I was looking around on demand and I saw a comercial about Incidious and thought of Poltergeist. I absolutly love the movie so I came here and broused until I found it. So I bought it and it arrived 5 days after I ordered it. Goodness I think I watched it a billion times if not more. I'm all into the ghosts and poltergeists and stuff so I love this movie. Came to me in perfect condition and I will keep it that way!
B004VSTP4Y|3.0|Loved the first two books of the series.  But at the last chapters it kinda fell short for me.  I fell like in this story everything should've been told and not left for the readers imagination.  Cole's survival tale was told have way, I think that isabel and Cole should have talked face to face.  They should have been able to heal each other and discovered what is like to really love and be loved unconditionally. And in Sam and Grace's story, even though we know that she wasn't going to end like Jack did, should have ended letting us know if the Meningitis injection really worked
0553801473|5.0|Internet fans are silly. A Dance with Dragons is a great book.  It's the second step to setting up The Winds of Winter. It does not deserve the low rating.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|The Hunger Games is definitely a must read.  I have enjoyed reading this book from start to finish.  I was impressed with the authors ability to capture and keep your attention throughout the book.  It is definetly a hard book to put down.  I read all sorts of novels but when it comes to teen novels I am very skeptical.  I have definetly enjoyed reading this book and look foward to read the rest of the trilogy.
B004ZZS4CC|5.0|An unbelievable story that brought me to tears. Jaycee was just a little girl when she was abducted by a married couple that was beyond disturbed. She then endured sexual and emotional abuse. My heart goes out to her and her family that had to endure this trauma. I wish her the best of luck in her life and may she live everyday to the fullest. My advice to her would be to explore every avenue that she wrote about, her one day wish. She lost 18 years of her childhood but this woman is a role model to victims in her position. Touching and heart felt the words will speak to everyone.
B000002HJA|5.0|...And The Circus Leaves Town is the fourth and final studio album by legendary Desert/Stoner pioneers Kyuss. The album was released in 1995, just before the band split up prior to any significant touring in support of the album.<br /><br />Featuring `Hurricane,' and the single `One Inch Man,' the album continues the band's evolution from raw garage sounds to spacey, psychedelic numbers mixed with solid rockers.<br /><br />No two Kyuss albums sound all that alike, but all retain a common theme of bassy sounds, 60s/70s rock influences and John Garcia's vocal style. ...And The Circus Leaves Town takes the band even further away from their debut and into some new territory altogether.<br /><br />The band were on fire and the musicianship and performances are absolutely exemplary, which when combined with their best production job to date results in one fantastic record.<br /><br />Standout tracks include material like `Catamaran,' and `Spaceship Landing,' which were impressive and ambitious, as well as the aforementioned `Hurricane,' and `One Inch Man,' which keep the album's rock credentials up.<br /><br />Some Kyuss fans don't rate this album just as highly as the two which came before it. Regardless, once you've tried those two albums jump straight into ...And The Circus Leaves Town with both feet, you won't be disappointed. Perhaps it cannot live up to the classic status of those two records, but it is still a brilliant album and well worth investigating.
B004EPYZSK|4.0|If you're a Western Steampunk fanatic then you will definitely want to watch this film. It has every bit of what you're looking for from the genre. Not having read the books, I was pleased with the plot development and characters. It's still a very mainstream movie so don't expect anything ground breaking.
B0055B0MIO|4.0|Trivium's fifth album In Waves is their first album with new drummer Nick Augusto, and their first to be produced by Colin Richardson. Nick's style of drumming fits the band well so there is no need to worry about Travis's absence. Additionally, the general standard of production is brilliant and even the quality of the lyrics has improved.<br /><br />At first, I was a little worried that the album mightn't be all that good, as I wasn't too keen on the pre-released tracks like the more radio friendly `In Waves,' and `Built To Fall,' or the heavier, more mid-album type tracks `Dusk Dismantled,' and `Inception Of The End,' all of which were objectively good songs but all seemed to be missing something.<br /><br />That many tracks should be indicative of the album's quality as a whole, so I didn't get my hopes up. They did all grow on me however, and definitely make even more sense within the context of the album as a whole, so if you weren't keen on those tracks either, don't let it put you off listening to the whole album.<br /><br />As a general rule, the songs are shorter than they were on the previous album Shogun, and a little more straight-forward in terms of composition and structure but this is not necessarily true of every single track. The best way to describe In Waves would be a mixture of radio friendly songs and Ascendancy type songs; when you get right down to it, its another regular Trivium album. No grand departure really.<br /><br />Every Trivium album so far has had some alteration to the style of the vocals, some harder, some softer and some mixed. In Waves could be described as more mixed, but with some additional styles not heard on a Trivium album before too.<br /><br />Overall; when you get past the vocal styles, the track lengths, the line up, the production and the albums historical context, at the end of the day the album will stand or fall on whether or not the songs are any good. In Waves has a lot of good songs on it, and for that reason alone you should pick up a copy.<br /><br />So to summarize, In Waves is a well written and well produced album, perhaps no the single best release in the band's career by leagues and leagues, but ultimately a strong release that long time Trivium fans should definitely add to their collection.<br /><br />*** If you should get the special edition version; you will find the bonus tracks `Slave New World,' which is a cover of the Sepultura classic, and `Shattering The Skies Above,' which previously featured on the Blood & Metal EP that was released to promote God Of War 3, as well as two bonus tracks `Ensnare The Sun,' and `Drowning In Slow Motion,' added into the actual running order of the album. This set comes with the discs housed in a double-digipak.<br /><br />In addition to the bonus tracks, there is a DVD featuring the music video for `In Waves,' as well as a `Making Of,' documentary which is fairly substantial at 41 minutes and much more serious in tone than `The Making Of Shogun.' Furthermore there is an astounding quality live concert filmed in the band's practice area at Chapman Studios, in a similar style to Nine Inch Nail's The Slip. The track listing is:<br />`In Waves,'<br />`Black,'<br />`Built To Fall,'<br />`Watch The World Burn,'<br />`The Deceived,'<br />`Suffocating Sight,'<br />`Down From the Sky,'<br />`Ember To Inferno.'<br /><br />The visuals, audio and editing of the live concert are absolutely superb and I highly recommend you buy this version. ***summarize, In Waves is a well written and well produced album, perhaps no the single best release in the band's career by leagues and leagues, but ultimately a strong release that long time Trivium fans should definitely add to their collection.    *** If you should get the special edition version; you will find the bonus tracks `Slave New World,' which is a cover of the Sepultura classic, and `Shattering The Skies Above,' which previously featured on the Blood & Metal EP that was released to promote God Of War 3, as well as two bonus tracks `Ensnare The Sun,' and `Drowning In Slow Motion,' added into the actual running order of the album.

1612130283|5.0|I enjoy something to challenge thinking. It had  wider appeal for me than romance or erotica. I read it twice.  The first,  I was utterly distracted  by the fantasy & kinkyf*y. The 2nd,  I thought about its uniqueness - this is quality nourishing, intriguing  provoking erotica, not fast food. The 2nd time I enjoyed the undercurrent more properly, enduringly. I see it as; 1. A love story, 2. A good look at  how a relationship can succeed in the challenging  situation of abuse/damage and 3. Mostly as an intelligent, complex, intriguing,  psychologic mystery. The enigmatic, erotic 50 (mindf*y)- it's a mind tease all through. He's wealthy, successful - so only 1 step away from a psychopath. We are shown all there is to see outside but truth is obscured in grey- like life.  4. And not least, quietly, I thought there were a few very  interesting ethical questions raised. It challenges simple settled definitions of what I thought constitutes abuse, paedophilia, acceptable boundaries of sexuality, tolerance. These things- it seems, often times are not black and white- and pre judging can be dangerous. For me this is a major appeal that lifts it beyond an average read.<br />It satisfies this ... \\"Often times, the artist is willing to look at the inconsistencies.. The grey areas are pieces of unsolved problems... The heart breaks open in wonderment at the acknowledgement of broken systems and failed ideas. Taking a good hard look at previously solved problems... is the artist's job\\"<br />Sexy sex-sells and is it the more very inventive & emotionally potent situations/implications created  by the protagonists' encounters that make the sex so extremely appealing ? It is well written. It captures imaginations. The writing isn't literary fiction- why does it have to be? Heroine is an unpretentious young girl from backwoods- not Phd in literature from exalted university.  As a love story it looks at what love is- it can be extrapolated to our own relationship-its not just the fantasy portrayed. In love we all do have our own equivalent of a 'Christian Grey' by our private reckoning?  The sexy limerance- but also mostly -deep friendship- involving honesty, trust & tolerance & that is what it says is needed to succeed over the long term
0811806405|5.0|for anybody needing good solid instructions, that not only tell you what you need to do, but also why, this book is for you.      it follows the process of making both a steal string acoustic and a classical guitar from start (actually before, from preparation) to completion.  It gives thorough instructions, but allows you to make alterations and changes as you see fit, so it is not a 'paint by the numbers' type of guide.  If you need to be hand held to the point of having the author make all of the decisions for you, then this is not your book.  If you just need a solid guide to outline the steps, in comprehensive detail, and point out the pitfalls along the way, then buy it now.      I will warn you that it does seem a bit dated, but the instruments, the tools, and of course the materials have not changed at all since this writing, so it is as valid today as the day that it was written.
1451629184|2.0|Started out well but went downhill. Almost like she got in a hurry and just wanted to finish. I found myself wanting to finish as well. Very little depth, detail as it progressed. Disappointing overall.
0756404738|2.0|I absolutely loved the first book in this series \\"The Name of the Wind\\".  It is a refreshing new fantasy story/world.  I was excited about second book coming out \\"The Wise Mans Fear\\".  I have to say that I am very disappointed with it.  As much as I loved the first book and I tried to enjoy the second one.  It was just boring and could have cut at least 75% of it out and got the point across.  If the last book in the trilogy is as bad as this one I may not read another one of his novels.  I had this author up there with George R.R. Martin on my good authors list until I read this garbage.  I hope Patrick Rothfuss delivers next time or he is losing at least one fan.  I've rambled enough ;)
0553386794|5.0|I must say that I am actually a huge fan of the HBO series. Peter Dinklage's portrayal of Tyrion is absolutely fantastic.<br /><br />At the same time, anybody who watches the television show without taking the time to read the books is doing themselves a disservice. GRRM's world are intricately plotted, and there's a depth to the characters in these novels that simply cannot be communicated in the television medium.<br /><br />For those of us who've read the series, we're getting the privilege of reliving the books in HBO's fantastic show; for the rest of you, get to reading! You won't regret it.<br /><br />-N
0316010669|2.0|This book has many great examples and is well written....that being said, his conclusions are all wrong. The conclusions are sooooo far off as compared to his examples that to claim this book as \\"self-help\\" is absolutely absurd. I wouldnt recommend this book to anyone.
B005D9MUWY|1.0|I&apos;ve never used a OSK that has as many amateur mistakes and poor programming choices as Swiftkeyboard X has. First off it loves to insert &apos;and&apos; after every comma, predictive text won&apos;t shut off for physical keyboards even when you then it off in the options, and it will ALWAYS fix your errors even if there is no error no matter what you do. Plus it has an obsession with turning &apos;Ethernet cables&apos; into &apos;ethnic cables&apos; even after teaching it Ethernet and selecting it multiple times.
1423101499|4.0|This is an enjoyable book in the Percy Jackson series. I was quite surprised when totally human (as opposed to half-god) Rachel showed up. Quite intriguing, and I definitely wanted to read the final book to learn more about Rachel. And, of course, to learn how the prophecy would come true and how the story would end. There were some interesting twists here, with Ariadne's string and Deadalus. This book was satisfying.
B002XZ62HK|4.0|I love Celtic women and I bought this as a gift to my mom. The CD is wonderful.

0553801473|2.0|. . . with everyone who expressed frustration with too many characters and plotlines.  While I have enjoyed the overall plotline/paradigm/tableau/whatever you want to call it, the buffet of storylines started really getting out of control in the fourth book.  Ironically Martin somewhat addresses this at the end by assuring all will be made clear in DWD.  It didn't take 100 pages to decide that wasn't the case. Hopelessly lost and frustrated, I just \\"went with it\\", no doubt missing a whole lot because constantly combing through the \\"glossary\\" at the end of the book every three pages was tedious in the extreme.  Bigger is not always better.
B003YL4LYI|1.0|This book was a huge disappointment for me. I was introduced to this story from the Showtime series & decided to read the books instead of watching the tele. I was completely addicted to the first 4 books, but this last one left too much unsaid. The story goes nowhere very slowly. What happens to Arya? Dani? Bran? Maybe it was told in the pages and pages of nothing that I skipped over. I was expecting a spectacular ending to this series that I didn't get. Dont waste the $ and the time it takes to read this book. Nothing gets solved, people die, people sit & talk of war & dragons. Dragons that never made it to Kings Landing & of a Queen that never took back her kingdom. Maybe Mr.Martin got tired of writing descriptions of starving men eating horses & people. I mean how many ways can you cook a horse...
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This is what I call a heroin book... it's addicting from the first time you pick it up and when its done your craving more.

0062060554|5.0|When the book opens, Chris Lucas wakes up in bed beside an older man.  Confused, she stumbles into the bathroom and looks into the mirror.  What she sees there gives her a turn - the woman in the mirror is at least twenty years older than Chris.  Then she sees the photos - her and the man in the bed, her alone, just the man - all with notes pointing to them.  \\"This is your husband Ben\\", says one.<br /><br />When Ben wakes, he explains (again) that she had an accident when she was 29 that left her with a brain injury.  She can retain information only during the span she is awake.  Once she goes to sleep, her memories are somehow wiped away.<br /><br />When Ben leaves for work, Chris receives a telephone call from a Dr. Nash, a neuropsychologist that she has apparently been seeing without Ben's knowledge.  He usually calls to tell her to get the journal she has been keeping out of it's hiding place in the closet.  When she sees him, he returns her journal, which she let him read the day before.  Written in her hand in the front of her journal are the words \\"Don't Trust Ben\\".<br /><br />Thus begins the journey into Chris's confusing life, where each day shapes new memories that are lost the next day.  Writing in and reading her journal every day give her at least a tentative grasp on her life.  As she re-learns her life every morning, memories (or are they dream fragments?) start to surface, floating and illusory.  As a reader pulled into Chris's bewildering situation, I felt a tense sense of foreboding.  There IS more than meets the eye in Chris's situation, and I was right beside her, trying to figure out who could be trusted and who could not.  Which memories are real and which are just hopes of memories?  Why does she not have any memory of the car accident that supposedly resulted in her injury, but DOES have flashes of an attack in a hotel room involving beating and near-drowning?  Is her husband lying about some things only to spare her or does he have a darker motivation?<br /><br />This is a truly gripping page-turner.

0446547603|5.0|Great Book! This was the first Nicholas Sparks book that I have read it was given to me as a Christmas Gift. Needless to say it will not be the last of his books that I read. I couldn't put it down. At the beginning I was thinking this could go any direction but after the first 30 pages I was hooked. I used every excuse I could to do nothing but sit down and read it. I even read it on my lunch breaks at work. Very easy and quick read! If you are reading this to decide if you should purchase it or not easy answer to your question! Yes, quit reading this and go purchase it :)

B000RJO578|5.0|I have been a fan of nick frost, and Simon pegg for a very long time.  This movie is a great example of appearances aren't always what they seem. It also shows that once you find a true friend, you should count yourself fortunate.   Damocles
B000YABYLA|3.0|I'm probably the last person in America to see this movie, but it finally came through Netflix. I kind of liked it, but I think it was pretty lightweight. For one thing, Juno herself had a ridiculous amount of \\"self-agency.\\" She is the one who decides to have sex (though she apparently didn't have the foresight to use contraception), she's the one who decides to have the baby and, finally, to give it up for adoption. Just from my own perspective, I don't see this a lot in the real world. First of all, a lot of teenagers, especially girls, kind of \\"fall into\\" sexual activity rather than straightforwardly seek it out. And in the same way, they often \\"fall into\\" parenthood. From what they've told me, and I've talked to a lot of them as a former L&D nurse, they often say something along the lines of,  \\"Well, the pregnancy wasn't planned, but it wasn't exactly unplanned either\\" (direct quote from a 14-year-old). This attitude is pretty typical. I just don't see many young girls as having the drive and self-awareness of Juno (of course, there are exceptions).     Also, Juno's family is there in the background, but you don't get any sense at all that they have affected her decisions. But in reality, the family and the family's attitude has a lot of influence in how the girl views her pregnancy and the decisions that she makes about it. In some cases that can be a good thing, but there can also be a lot of force used against girls--psychologically, if not physically--and that can be very destructive. If the girl is forced into a specific decision, while it might ease the situation temporarily with her family, I think the psychological consequences over the long term are much more negative for her. Juno's family is rather too rare in their immediate supportiveness and acceptance--it's great, but not the usual case.    Another thing that was bothersome about the movie was the way Juno referred to \\"it,\\" or this \\"thing.\\" It implies that teenage girls don't really bond with their babies, which a) I don't think is typically the case, but which b) supports the end of the movie when Juno and her boyfriend don't spend time with the baby (he doesn't even see it), which I find pretty unbelievable. I'm not saying that there aren't cases where people might not want to see the baby, but the movie kind of implies that Juno, who has opted for a traditional closed adoption, has solved her \\"problem\\" now that the baby is gone from her life. It just doesn't seem very realistic, in that Juno was not an abuse case or a rape victim, that Juno wouldn't continue to wonder about her baby (and even abuse and rape victims will continue to wonder, I think, but might have more conflicted feelings about having a relationship with a child given up for adoption). She may not want to be a big part of the child's life, but she will always be in some sense, that child's mother, and giving the baby away for adoption doesn't erase that history.     Finally, to the adoptive family. Of course, the guy turns out to be kind of immature, and that is what it is, but I have to say, I could barely see anything at all about the   adoptive mother that I would find attractive. She just seemed so materialistic, emotionally shut down, and controlling. Yes, Juno sees her playing with a kid in the mall but that's about the only time you see anything attractive in her character. (Oh, and the scene where she talks to Juno's stomach in the mall--really??? Kind of over the top.)     In conclusion, I guess my main complaint is that I found the whole movie to be very unpsychological. Yes, of course, it's Hollywood, but really the characters and the situations were just a little too pat. In the richest movies and literature, you can watch them or read them over and over again and get something new each time. This movie was basically a one-view deal.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Outstanding story, imaginative, daring, and intriguing. I can't wait to read the sequels.  I had not read Collins before, but will certainly continue to look at her other works. I can go into details about the story line, its strengths and weaknesses (none), but I fear I won't do it justice. All I can tell you is Collins does a great job of putting you in the setting, I felt as though I was living in the arena the entire time, it heightened all my senses as I read it. Collins, along with her main characters, draw out the most instinctive chanracteristics of humans, survival. When I read a great book, it normally takes me a couple of weeks, because my schedule. I read this one in 3 days. I simply couldn't put it down, much like the main characters, sleep is not an option. Can't wait for the movie.
0553801473|3.0|Well, I have to say I'm pretty disappointed with the latest installment in the series. I've been waiting along time for this book and to be honest with the whole time I was reading it I was just so ecstatic to have the wonderful characters like Tyrion and Jon in my life, I would have told you it was the greatest book ever written. However, after doing a little reread I must say I'm left thoroughly disappointed with the latest chapter in the Ice and Fire saga.

B004LWZW4M|5.0|The movie focuses on an Ape named Caesar whose mother was given a medicine in a lab test that could possibly be the cure to Alzheimer's disease. Upon receiving the medicine she becomes extremely intelligent, solving puzzles that no normal ape would be able to solve. She later on gives birth to an ape, who also shows signs that he is just as intelligent and therefore the mother genetically passed it onto him. The mother was killed in the lab and therefore one of the workers decided to take the baby ape home before the other workers found it and decided to kill him as well. This is how the movie starts off.     Now, without giving too much info away, Caesar eventually has a desire to stand up to human kind after he learns what happened to his mother and how he doesn't fit in with the human world (let's face it, he's as smart as a human but everyone sees him as nothing more than an ape).     I'll end it there because otherwise I will give too much info away about the movie. I just have to say that this movie was absolutely amazing though. It really does make you feel sorrow toward not only the animals in the movie, but in the real world. Humans can't seem to respect nature. This movie will make your emotions go from sorrow, to anger, etc. It's great. Go see it!

B00005N6KG|4.0|I got these to replace some old sony foldable headphones that I broke; these are a good match in sound quality, but in terms of fit and function, not quite up to par. The are not foldable, of course, and they don't hug my head as well, so they have a tendency to slip out of my ears when I am running. I like them overall, but I won't be using them for running as I had planned.
0140143505|5.0|I caught this movie on TV one time years ago and it intrigued me right away. I've watched it every time I can find on tv. Only recently did it dawn on me that there might be a book on it. I was extremely happy to find it on Amazon, which is now and forever my go to place. The book was wonderful. It's a short read, but it's something you can keep with you in your purse and if you just want a quick read or a something to make you smile you can pull this out. For those that just love books and the worlds they take you to, this would be a good one to keep in your collection. It reminds you why you love to read and that it's not just you. No one writes letters like these anymore and it's a treasured part of our past.     I've loaned it to my mother and plan to re-read it when she returns it; which doesn't seem to be anytime soon as she's enjoying the book just as much as I did!
B004GUSG4M|4.0|I have to believe that some studio is rushing to get this story made into a movie. Perfect thriller premise: A young women has a type of amnesia that renders her unable to remember anything from the previous day when she wakes up from sleeping. She doesn't recognize the man in the bed next to her, until he calmly reassures her, with pictures, and by what he tells her, that they are in fact married, and her disability is the result of a horrible accident some twenty years prior. She then receives a call from a man claiming to be her doctor who tells her he's been treating her, and that she should look inside her closet where she'll find a diary she's been keeping that is an attempt to regain her past. On the inside flap she has written: Don't trust Ben. (her husband). From there much of the book is her diary entries as the mystery unravels. And although there are definite moments that require a healthy amount of suspension of disbelief, this still is one fun descent into the shadowed recesses of a woman's shrouded mind.

0307472841|3.0|This book starts with a bang.  Nearly an entire small Swedish town is found brutally murdered.  A judge going through a low point in her life turns her attention to it and finds some clues the police have missed and inexplicably seem not to care about.     The book tells several stories:  the judge, a Chinese man in the 1800s, and a modern Chinese family.  Many of the characters are beautifully written, although some parts if the judge's investigations seem implausible.      Although it started very strongly, it ends unsatisfactorily. It felt like the author needed to get the book in on a deadline and so threw a few things in at the end without taking the care evident at the beginning.  It is not pulled together.      This is the first book I have read by this author.  I was impressed enough at the beginning that I will try another of his work, but I will not recommend this one.

B004EPZ0BG|3.0|Friends turn to each other for their basic need of sex, no strings attached.  Of course you can see it coming a mile away, they are meant for each other.  I think they cast the parts perfect, even Justin Timberlake did a good job being the bumbling guy in this movie. Granted the movie want win any awards but its a good way to spend a date night, feel good movie with a lot of laughs.
1594744769|3.0|\\"Abandon hope, all ye who enter here\\" would be an appropriate warning for readers opening the cover of this novel. Imagine, Reader, that you are taking a writing class. Your instructor displays a photograph and says, \\"Write about this.\\" Such a thing would not seem too difficult, no matter the actual image on the photo. Right? Now imagine instead that the instructor scatters over 100 photos on a table and tasks you with choosing about 40 (the author credits 44) and then formulating a cohesive story that incorporates them all. In this way, the author's decision to adhere to this premise on such a large scale is its main flaw. I believe it could have worked if not for the fact that the sheer number of images the author chose to use meant that he had to try to come up with something clever to include about each one. And I don't think he succeeded. In fact, it was at several points in the story during which he describes something shown in a photo (for example, Boy in Bunny Costume-a photo that appears to have been taken without a flash during daylight hours-not \\"at nightfall\\" as indicated, Department Store Santa-nobody noticed a guy with those creepy eyes? and especially the scribble scrabble on page 334) that the thought, \\"This is the best he could do?\\" came to mind.<br /><br />In addition to the convoluted plot, there are several instances in which incidents are totally predictable, even for readers like me who are not generally skilled at figuring things out, and, in a few places, nonsensical. As one who has never really needed, nor wanted, illustrations in a story for teens and up (I'd prefer to use my imagination, thank you very much), the photos did little to add to my appreciation of the story. Also, the book jacket blurb suggests that these peculiar children \\"...may have been dangerous,\\" but this does not turn out, in general, to be the case. Lastly, although I didn't find anything to complain about in the writing style, neither did I find any specific part worthy of praise. Worst of the book: too much \\"stuff' that had to happen in order for the author to include so many sometimes quirky vintage photos. Best: overall plot when boiled down to the basics, the intrigue of Abe's dying words, and the peculiars' peculiarities. In summary, author Ransom Riggs' odd plot's potential remains unreached because of his decision to include so many images (and thus have to incorporate the accompanying text) and suffers from several predictable and/or nonsensical situations. Better: The Book Thief by Markus Zusak, The Stolen Child by Keith Donohue, and The Book of Lost Things by John Connolly.<br /><br />**Note: the rest of this review contains plot spoilers.**<br />Specific complaints:<br />(p 99) \\"A [peregrine] was perched on my dresser.\\" That this was Miss Peregrine was obvious.<br />(p 159) \\"He was like you, Jacob.\\" Who did not correctly suspect the meaning of this statement?<br />Dr. Golan, expectedly, is not who he seems.<br />The ornithologist, expectedly, is a bad guy.<br />The eyes of wights, readers learn, have no pupils, a condition, we are told, that can be disguised through the use of contact lenses. So Jacob learns that the ornithologist is Dr. Golan is (Pp 289-290) Mr. Barron is the yard man, which means that not only is Jacob (as well as his father) terrible at remembering faces (the four men are one and the same) but also this wight-of-all-trades didn't bother to use contact lenses as, at a minimum, the bus driver or yard man. Instead, he chose to wear sunglasses at all times. Why do so when it's likely to arouse suspicions in those less oblivious than the Portmans?<br />Jacob's father, even if engrossed in his pursuit of birds for his latest (likely unsuccessful) book project, is on a remote, foreign island with his sixteen-year-old son who has been attending therapy sessions because of his firm belief that he saw a tri-tentacled creature on the day his grandfather died. Although Mr. Portman shows concern about his son'smental health, and even calls Dr. Golan at one point, he repeatedly allows him to wander around the island unsupervised. That the author believes that parents would buy in to such a situation leads me to conclude: he is not a father.<br />Lastly, I think that for the author to choose to have the peculiars live through the Groundhog Day-like infinite loop of September 3, 1940, repeatedly for seventy years, which converts to 25,550, was asking too much of even readers most accepting-of-farfetchedness.one point, he repeatedly allows him to wander around the island unsupervised.

There's friendship, a man wrongly accussed, deseption, greed, and in the end justice. Now you aren't going to find car chases and action packed scenes what you will a very good movie.

B002ZTQVGQ|2.0|HAM!!! Studio Ghibli does it again! They've coupled fantastic, mind-bending art to a bizarre, possibly LSD trip-inspired, story. The dialogue in the film is awkward, the characters are mentally unbalanced, and the brief discussion on babies and breast feeding after the big flood scene is, well, weird! I especially don't buy the scene where the two main super cute little kid characters recite from memory the scientific names of ancient sea creatures with the rapidity one would only expect from a seasoned paleoichthyologist. If you are determined to watch Ponyo, watch it for the art.    I hope Studio Ghibli finds out what chemicals are affecting their script writers.
B0009P5YXO|5.0|After my personal sonic broke, I thought I was done for. Luckily, this product shipped fast enough that I managed to stop a Dalek invasion. Plus it has a pen on the end! My old one didn't have that, and now I can sign papers and whatnot if I ever get in local trouble. Very good for parlor tricks and distractions.
B004HD61KE|5.0|Best Rollins novel yet! Fast paced and well researched. Of all the great locations in past novels the locations in Devil Colony are by far the coolest, it doesn't get any better than a life and death showdown in the back county of Yellowstone Park.  Can't wait for the next novel.

After re reading the first book again, I decided to re read the other 2 books again as well. They are really that good of a read, and this is coming from a loyal Harry Potter fan.<br />A destined classic for sure!

Even though there are many Tarot and Oracle cards out there that are as good, these are unique and can help you figure out what your likes, hobbies, and purpose can be. Which to me is AWESOME and on point, which can be a little scary but it's all in good intentions and spiritual growth!

B004HO6I4W|5.0|*Spoiler alert as requested:<br />Rio was surprising and my family and I loved this movie. Rio begins with Blu a rare macaw as a wee baby bird, who falls out of a tree where he lands softly and is soon scooped up by a poacher. While on a truck with other exotic birds now in the U.S. Blu falls out of the truck and is found by a little girl. This little girl domesticates and raises Blu and as she grows into a woman, Blu blossoms into a handsome grown macaw. The two are inseparable and soon are on their way to Rio when a friend of Blu's owner convinces her to breed Blu with Jewel(Anne Hathaway). Jewel is the female version of Blu who is the last of her kind, soon to be extinct. Blu (Jesse Eisenberg) is quite the character and had me laughing the whole time. Once in Rio Blu doesn't think it is such a good idea to mate, after he meets and speaks to Jewel in a bird lab. Jewel is an angry macaw that has has been trying to escape from this lab and is in no mood for chatting. During the night Jewel and Blu are stolen from the lab, but not without a fight from Jewel and soon their adventure begins. While in Rio, Blu befriends some wise-cracking, smooth talking exotic city birds (including Gorge Lopez),who helps him along the way. But because Blu has never learned how to fly, he is constantly walking while others are flying, which at times gets him and Jewel into some very serious and dangerous situations. The soundtrack throughout Rio is beautiful and so are the effects. I highly recommend this movie for the whole family, it is a beautiful and colorful treat for the eyes with a soulful Latin contemporary sound-track mix. I give it 5 out of 5 stars.

She is a very good artist. Everyone should at least give her a chance. Don't judge her just because she was on Disney. I don't have a problem with it. I like Disney. Not everyone on Disney is bad or fake. Anyway great songs! Love her!
B004LWZW24|4.0|I love to be scared and this movie REALLY delivered the goods!<br /><br />The concept of a child using astral projection and then getting lost, unable to find his way back to his body was a great concept!  His body is unprotected and spirits want to possess it so they can live again, but there is a demon that wants it even more so he can enter our world and spread pain and suffering!  However when we actually saw the demon it looked like Darth Maul's retarded cousin.<br /><br />The ghosts were creepy as hell and the ghost world was portrayed beautifully and it creeped the hell outta me and had me constantly on my toes!  The old lady ghost was creepy too, she gave me nightmares for days!<br /><br />If you love scary movies or if you liked the Paranormal Activity movies, then you'll love this one!

144471032X|5.0|If you have tried every diet on the planet like I have, try this one.  So far it is the only one that is working for me.  I started the diet April 15th and have lost 40 pounds so far.  I lapsed on the diet for almost a month due to some family illness issues which made it impossible for me to prepare most of my meals.  I was running back and forth to the hospital so much I grabbed all the wrong foods instead of preparing my own.  But I am back on it again and losing again.    It is not like Atkins in many ways.  It leaves out all the fat that Atkins says is okay to eat.  It also has 4 phases which help you keep the weight off.  Everyone I know who went on Atkins, gained every pound back and then some.  Including me.  I could do this for the rest of my life.  I am 66 years old, now I look early fifties, according to my friends.  I am disabled due to needing a knee replacement, which I have scheduled for January 2012.  I want to lose 40 more pounds first.  I have told other friends about it, One lost all of the 20 pounds she needed to lost in 2 months, she looks wonderful and is on the phase to stablize.  People that have seen me shrinking these past few months, all want to go on this diet.  But it takes determination and real committment.  If you do this you won't be sorry.
B004L03B3S|1.0|If the write-up on this film leads you to expect an interesting story about a quasi-incestuous relationship between two half-brothers, spare yourself. Spoiler alert: the boys love each other as children, as teens and as adults. Period. There's no story development, just tedious sequences of the boys swimming together, then kissing, then swimming. It has all the drama of a 4-hour commercial for speed-o's. To paraphrase a critic's assessment of Poulenc, this director had absolutely nothing to say...and he said it. If you want really soft-porn, but have a heart condition, go for it.
0765356139|5.0|I have just finished books 1 and 2 of this series and have enjoyed them immensely.  The author has created a very unique world, original forms of magic I never dreamed of, and a great story line.  I had read some complaints that the second book was too slow.  I disagree - I thought it was great.  You get to find out more about the characters, the struggle they are in, there is tons of exciting action, and the ending is terrific and surprising.  I am really taken with this author now.   I can't wait to get into the third and final book in this series.  If you like fantasy you will like this series.
B004JN1D2I|2.0|I suggest buying each book in this series separately if you are buying them for kindle.  The 4-book bundle is the same cost as buying each book separately, or at least they were when I purchased it.  Of course, they read the same but navigating them is more difficult.  There is also a page number glitch that allows you to see each page number only up to the end of the first book.  After that every page is 695 out of 695 for books 2-4.  The other thing that bothers me is that the progress bar at the bottom of the kindle screen contains all 4 books.  Its hard to gauge progress when 2-3 chapters may only represent 1% of the entire 4-book bundle.
B002ZG975Q|1.0|Predictable. Ridiculous. Cheesy. Cliche. Absurd. Oh, so many words come to mind when describing this film. I'm not sure whatever convinced the makers of this film that this fairytale needed to come to the screen as a live-human film, but it was a horrible decision. Worse yet was the script they chose.<br /><br />It's one thing for a fur bearing, claw-bearing, roaring, ranting animated beast to kidnap and hold prisoner the girl in a cartoon...it's really quite another for a flesh and blood human being. On the one hand, it is so fantastical that you can go with it; on the other, it's just a little too creepy. Add into this that the witch is absurd, the \\"beastly\\" transformation is laughable, the characters are weak, the dialog is bad, and the rest is only mediocre, and you have a big, bad, beastly waste of time: \\"Beastly\\".<br /><br />I would like to say that, to be fair, there were good points to this film...but I honestly can't remember any. The closest I can come is that the main actors seemed higher caliber than their roles here; and that there were some funny moments, few and far between. But, alone in this wilderness of refuse, they seem hardly more than a few points on the horizon.<br /><br />I have never read the book (nor do I plan to), so I don't know if it's as much of a stinker as this film; the mere fact that it must bear some commonalities, however, to the film is enough to dissuade me from the effort -- there are too many worthy books to waste the time on this.<br /><br />1/5 stars. What a dud.
1416583432|4.0|My spouse brought home a book the other day: Inside Of A Dog: What Dogs See, Smell and Know by Alexandra Horowitz. I read half of it last night. I took a walk with the dogs this morning with a new-found respect for these canine companions of mine.<br /><br />I went slow and let the dogs use their noses to enjoy the forest. You see, dogs mainly experience the world through their noses. It is their way of seeing the world. A dog's nose is how they confirm that you are you: they need to smell you. They also can tell, by their noses, when you are sick. Or lonely. Or anxious.<br /><br />Horowitz believes that dogs have been living with humans much longer than the generally accepted 12,000 to 14,000 years. Her evidence is found in mitochondria, whereby the first split from wolves occured around 140,000 years ago.<br /><br />Horowitz doesn't say this, but I will: This beneficial relationship between dogs and humans allowed both species to thrive. We are meant to live with dogs. In fact, to not have a dog is not human. Think of dogs in the past as the way people view cell phones today. Cell phones have replaced dogs as our constant companions. Cell phones are the new dogs.<br /><br />I'd rather have a dog.
B004XQO90O|4.0|A soldier wakes up in a train, across from a companion he's never seen, with a reflection and identity that...isn't his. What in blazes is going on?<br /><br />A good question -- and one that Jake Gyllenhaal's soldier character must unravel, as he relives the last eight minutes before a deadly explosion, again and again and again.<br /><br />This film answers that question, and concludes, in an admirable manner. It is does not waste time trying to give us details that we wouldn't accept anyway, but just presents the answer, and keeps going. The acting is great, the mystery intriguing, and the filming done in such a way as to draw you in. You, as the viewer, know no more than Gyllenhaal's character, and so learn only what he learns, as he learns it. You get frustrated, as he does, with each failed attempt to uncover the killer. You are relieved at his successes and astonished by the surprises that he encounters. As he gets to know his companion, you feel that you, too, get to know her -- for no replay is exactly the same as the other, and so you see different glimpses of her personality.<br /><br />By time you are half way through the film, you will have caught inklings of the ending; but it's nice to have your suspicions confirmed -- or refuted, depending on what you picked up from those earlier scenes.<br /><br />This is not a \\"believable\\" movie, but, if you put your sense of disbelief on hold, it all seems plausible -- within the context of the film, there are no glaring omissions or contradictions.<br /><br />4/5 for an exciting sci-fi thriller.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Suzanne Collins' &#34;The Hunger Games&#34; was brilliant, enrapturing, and left me feeling as though I had indulged a part of myself that many other books had left unsatisfied. The careful blending of romantic anguish, gut-wrenching fear, and the corruption of innocence in a dystopian society was so masterful I was left in awe. Collins is a master in creating a &#34;page-turner&#34; for the times. In a work that paralles great works such as &#34;Anthem&#34; and &#34;Fahrenheit 451&#34;, Collins' Katniss Everdeen had me jovial, maudlin, petrified through each experience with the terrifying capitol. Her relatability is astounding throughout the book and any teenage girl thrust into her position would have made choices identical to hers. The best asset of the book for me was Peeta Mellark. I commend whatever kind, gentle, lovable man inspired Peeta. Throughout the book, I found myself falling in love with Peeta for a new reason each chapter. His devotion, ardor, and willingness to anything for Katniss make the book all the more enticing a read. Once finished, I found myself craving more of the relatable Katniss, lovable Peeta, pessimistic Haymitch, free-thinking Gale, delicate Prim and the many other ingeniously crafted personalities Suzanne Collins has given me. I give &#34;The Hunger Games&#34; a well-earned five stars and recommend it to anyone who wishes to live vicariously through the adventures of an amazing heroine like Katniss Everdeen.

1451629184|5.0|How do you rate a book such as this one? Do you say it is good? Do you say excellent reading? For me, I am not able to say either because of WHAT this book is really about. I do have to say that I feel everyone, needs to read it!  I picked up the book and could not stop reading it. I read this book in one day, just a few hours was all that it took. I wanted to know how Jaycee survived. I wanted to know more about her today as well. This book covers all of it.   For anyone who has survived i.e. domestic violence, sexual assault ect. You will understand the words that are expressed through this book. You can relate and understand where her mind was at the time. Those that said \\"why didn't she try to leave?\\" will now understand the control and manipulation that this monster had over her, after all, she was only 11 at the time, and domestic violence survivors know all too well, the control of manipulation.  My heart goes out to Jaycee and her family. I remember when I heard of her abduction, and I remember when they said that they found her. I am glad that they are reunited and applaud her strength and courage to pull through and come out the other side and the strength that she has to continue on. Brave! I also, learned something new in which I thank Jaycee for, \\"the word NO, is a full sentence\\"..
B0055IU3VS|5.0|It's tough being an icon. It's also tougher having a back catalog as rich and good as John Hiatt's. Every album Hiatt makes is measured against the best of the past. Earlier in a career you're likely to see an artist breaking new ground and by the time most people have reached the same point that Hiatt has in his, they're just creating inferior versions of material they've done before. That's not the case here. While Hiatt may not be as musically experimental here as he has in the past, he has lyrically and musically continued to grow as an artist.<br /><br /> Hiatt proved that American lives do, indeed, have a second act with some of his previous releases (with the exception of the really bad but amusing \\"Little Head\\")and continues to prove it with \\"Dirty Jeans & Mudslide Hymns\\".<br /><br />11 tracks most of which hold their own with some of Hiatt's best writing \\"Dirty Jeans & Mudslide Hymns\\" is probably one of his most consistently pleasing discs.<br /><br />Hiatt has always been good at mining his personal life for material and also creating portraits of those who surround us. His latest album does a good job of doing both with songs such as \\"Adios to California\\" and \\"When New York Had Her Heart Broke\\".<br /><br />I would recommend (if you have a nice audio system) springing for the deluxe edition which includes a high def transfer of the album on a DVD-A as well as a brief but interesting documentary on the making of the album.<br /><br />Recommended.
1936594641|5.0|Stevenson's book is a wonderful adventure into the darker side of our personalities. As Jekyll tries to alleviate his pent up emotions, the reader learns more about the Victorian era and its norms. The ominous beginning with the mysterious door, sets the scene for a terrain that may be all too familiar for many of us. Though we may not go as far as Jekyll does, we can all identify with the taboo subjects the novel covers. Posterity is lucky to have such an evocative novel from a master writer.

B001GAPC1K|5.0|This is my all time favorite movie, right next to \\"The Lincoln Lawyer\\".  It is amazing how technological this movie is; how they combined several different types of advanced technology from the abundant power supply to the jets that make him fly and make it look so realistic and possible.  I also enjoyed the sophisticated voice activated and control machinery and computerized technology of his workshop.  It would be great to see a continuation of this movie like a sequel.
1932100660|5.0|What can I add that almost 1000 other reviewers haven't already touched on? I work as a scientist and I approached this rather skeptically. However, the data and the arguments presented are irrefutable. There is not just one factor or study that points to a magic potion for good health. BUT, there is overwhelmingly and consistent evidence, both epidemiological and that the close to a wholefoods plant-based diet you are, the less risk you'll have for a host of chronic diseases. Due to my initial skepticism, I looked up and read many of the primary research articles cited in the book. Overall they are sound. I also read and studied the criticisms of this book and alternative viewpoints, eg. Weston A. Price, the \\"cholesterol and sat. fat are good\\" people, etc. At first glance, their claims can sound convincing, and as a meat eater, there's a voice in your head saying \\"what if all that compelling evidence is wrong and I miss out on eating all those tasty animal products?\\" However, the counter-arguments do not stand up to serious scientific scrutiny.    Thoroughly recommended to everyone interested in their own health and wellbeing.
0671027344|5.0|How I let such a gem hide, unread, on my shelf is unknown! Chbosky hits on every censorship hot-button possible, which I probably wouldn't have noticed had I not read it in honor of Banned Books Week. (It's #10 on ALA's most frequently challenged / censored books of 2000-2009.) Beautifully written, the words are lyrical on the page and the message is clear: be honest with yourself and true to what you want. This is a story about friendship and loss and compassion, and mostly about figuring out who YOU really are and then BEING that person, despite what the rest of the world may think. This one is a treasure!
B004SBQGHS|4.0|I play this game way too much.  its super addicting and the birds are just too cute!  had to get Rio too!
1423395050|3.0|All in all not a bad read, but not my favorite either. I am a fan of sci-fi fiction, but CHILDHOOD'S END, for me was a victim of a too chaotic plot. There is just so much going on. The idea behind the chaos was a decent one, but the story itself had just too much overall general information covering such a vast array of characters over a long span of time, making it very difficult to connect with any one protagonist or any of the many characters for that matter. I found CHILDHOOD's END to be a very grandiose idea that lacked depth and detail and even though the ending is quite strong, I can't say I didn't see it coming; nor was it the first sci-fi story to come to a similar end. Granted it very well may be The First (being that Clarke originally published CHILDHOOD'S END back in 1953), but it's far from the first of its likes to cross my path and unfortunately not the best executed/developed. Think Independence Day meets Twilight Zone.
B004SBS8LA|4.0|I really enjoy playing angry birds.  I don&apos;t like this one nearly as much because its got too many obstacles that make it more challenging, which really is just more aggravating.  But I have to rate this one one the high end because its still a great game with great graphics!
0307341577|3.0|This book kept me guessing, which kept me reading. I will not spoil the outcome for others, but I was very disappointed in the \\"secret.\\" I would have never guessed the ending, but I thought it came on all too quickly and the solution was rushed.
B004RJMUJO|4.0|really enjoy playing this game.  works well but almost too easy to accidentally slice the bombs when getting the fruit.
B000256TD0|5.0|I am extremely happy with my purchase!!!  It is exactly what I was looking for.  Best of all, it arrived very quickly!
B004VMVTNU|1.0|My clock beta has a better ui.  I have used it forever, but got this cuz it was free.  So I am going back to my clock.
B001F7MSG6|5.0|I am not going to discuss the movie itself, as there are plenty of reviews that focus on that, so please read those if thats what you are looking for.<br /><br />I will be concentrating strictly on picture and sound quality for those that have not yet purchased this.<br /><br />The picture quality is top notch all the characters are shown in clear vibrant well saturated hues. This movie has a main color pallet of blues, golds and rich earthy tones that are so well done you really do feel imersed in the wold the director created.<br /><br />This BD creates this with stunning depth and realism<br />hell boys deep red skin texture is mostly constant throughout the film and looks amazing on BD, from deep  black levels to its well saturated but never overdone colors, this is the type of film that showcases the true capability of BD extremely well.<br /><br />One thing to note that I feel helps further immerse you into this world is the fact this film is not shown letter boxed, so it will fill your full 16x9 screen from top to bottom, actually I prefer this wide screen format over the other, while this is my personal preference others might also agree. I just feel that when a film is shown in this format it just makes it feel more like your set is a real movie screen then if you see it framed with black bars top and bottom.<br /><br />As for the sound of the film the word awesome is the only way to describe it. The dialog is recorded with fantastic accuracy. Voices throughout the film never sound thin or tiny as I have heard on many a film, and are always mixed at levels that are legible and clear no mater what the scene throws at you, from gunfire to<br />rumbling LF F/X you can always hear what is being said.<br /><br />When the film calls for LF FX this BD delivers. The bottom end is powerful but not boomy, what you get is a solid low end punch mixed flawlessly with enough rumble to create a realistic HT experience you will not soon forget.<br /><br />I think this is a film that any true collector and or Home Theater enthusiast should definitely own.hould definitely own.
B004H7QICG|4.0|We built a workstation with this case, and it is very tight (packed with 6 HDs + 1 SSD and two GPUs).  The case is very well designed and the parts and coating are top notch.  We originally purchased the case for a low-noise room, but realized this wasn't going to necessarily cut it.  It may be due to how packed the thing is, but nonetheless, it is important to note for those wanting to make a future purchase.    Overall, however, I think this is possibly the best case on the market, having used several of the current competitors in other builds.
B004LWZW24|1.0|The first half of this show would be a good build up for a really scary movie.  That being said the second half of the show is a JOKE!  It is like 2 different movies.  I don't know how people could have been scared by this movie.  Oh how I love to sharpen my claws listening to Tiny Tim!
B0055B0MIO|5.0|Just for the record, this review is about the special edition with the bonus tracks:  In Waves by Trivium is another one of their triumphant albums full of catchy and exciting guitar riffs, pounding drums and strong vocals. In Waves has many similarities to their critcally acclaimed Acendensy album but really what most of these fans are hearing is a classic heavy metal record which meshes all of their past musical skills like their thrash speed, their heavy screaming vocals and fast guitar solos, all of these meshed into their perfect record. All of the songs are keepers but of course their is a few standout tracks that you seem to go back to everytime, one of those important songs. Any of the songs on this record could be one of those memorable songs because every song is so damn good. I will go track by track and say what I have to say about each of them....    Capsizing The Sea sounds like the beginning to freak and dark circus. It's intense and frightening and has a great military beat when the drums and guitars blend. That evil sounding piano will give you nightmares for weeks. This little song sounds like their are twenty different musicians going all at once which totally makes it sound epic.    In Waves really reels in the listener, the first thing heard when listening to this song is Matt screaming In Waves and then this epic drum and guitar battle begins. The best thing about this song is the mixture of the screaming vocals and the clean vocals, it really shows how much they have matured. I was kind've critical of this song when it first came out because it sounded kind've commercial for them but it really grew on me, I hope it does for you as well.    Inception of the End is a classic Trivium, its something that you could imagine being on either Acendensy or The Crusade. The beginning guitar riff is extremely catchy and overally this is a very well rounded song with again the mixture of screaming and clean vocals.Their is a very short guitar solo but I guess it adds to the intensity of the song.    Dusk Dismantled is argueable the heaviest song on the album. It sounds like a mixture of trash metal, black metal and melodic death metal. This song is amazing either way. The guitar riff is really intense and catchy. This song is all screaming and....I....they're really isn't any words to describe how extreme and epic this song is. THe guitar solo is fast and high pitched, the riffs just scream into your mind and it feels like your eyeballs are gonna pop out and your brain is going to melt. That is the only way to describe this song.    Watch The World Burn is another great song, another song that could've came off Acendensy. This song is mostly composed of clean vocals. The best part about this song is defintly the chorus, it's intense, raging and catchy. Their is a pretty good guitar solo within this epic track...its one of those song that you just have to listen to.    Black is one of their more commercial songs but its still an epic song. It's all clean vocals but the guitar riff is really heavy. It's one of the shortest songs on the album but it last so long because you continue to replay it. Their is rage within the lyrics and Matt Heafy really expresses it in the best way, clean but rough vocals.    A Skylines Severance really proves to be a standout song. This song expresses the true skills of the drummer, it is just constant changing of drumming riffs. It's really fast, really heavy and overall just a clssic Trivium tune. It's all screaming like Dusk Dismantled and has some touches of black metal in it. I really love this song for its great breakdown which contains a ggreat guitar riff as every other trivium song has. The guitar solo really changes the song but makes it epicer if thats even a word.    Ensnare The Sun is a weird Trivium song, its something different. It's short and sweet but it has acoustic guitars that blend a spanish and italian sound. Their is like a religious humming in the background. It sounds egyptian for christ sake. I dont know but its pretty good, just listen to it.    Built to Fall is another one of those commercial Trivium songs but is as epic as Black. It's intense and has a catchy chorus. Their is another very good solo. The bets part is probably the bridge that leads into the chorus thought because its epic, no other way to describe it's just WOW!!!    Caustic Are the Ties That Bind songs a little more like something that would come off Shogun. It's really an incredible song with one of the best choruses. It becomes slow and clean but then picks up several times. It's really a flash of brilliance, great screaming tune. The drums are epic and pounding. I am running out of adjectives to describe how awesome these songs are. I will go on thesaurus.com. Again, this song has a slow breakdown before an epic guitar solo comes and kicks your a**. Another astonishly amazing song.    Forsake Not The Dream is really a different song by Trivium, the beginning guitar piece sounds like something off a punk record but like a lot of Trivium songs it picks up and turns into an epic thrash/metalcore song. I just really adore the mixture of screaming and clean/rough vocals, it really makes me smile. This song is just inconcievable (like that one) and unimaginable. EPIC BREAKDOWN AND GUITAR SOLO!!!    Drowning in Slow Motion as Matt Heafy screams is an awkward title to a song but its an awkward title to a genius song. Another great chorus with a catchy guitar riff. Why the hell do I continue to make comments about these songs when I've said the same exact thing twenty times. You know that the rest of the album is going to be incredible so lets sum it up really quick...    A Grey So Dark is the Dying in Your Arms of In Waves. It's a metal ballad, but its personally my favorite of the album. It's damn catchy    Chaos Reigns is another really heavy black metal influenced song but is more of a thrash song than anything. Quite Stupendous...    Of All These Yesterdaysis another one of my favorites off the album, its a slower song but it shows true musicianship and versatility.    Leaving This World Behind is a great ending song, it really is powerful and just ends off the album on a strong note assuring us fans that another kick ass record will come soon.    Shattering the Skies Above has been out for awhile for Gods of War and as everybody probably already knows, its a great thrash/metalcore song    Slave New World which is a cover of a Sepultra song is very good, probably my least favorite song on the album but I can still listen to it    That concludes my monlogue about In Waves and how good it is. Please, I highly recommend buying either the standard or deluxe version because both are great. Of course with the deluxe you get some great extras and a great documentary and some great live videos. Don't pirate it just buy it...support the band
B004EYT932|4.0|I purchased (today) this Kindle book for my Toshiba Thrive (Honeycomb 3.1).  I was concerned when I read a previous review that the tables would not be present.  THEY ARE HERE!  Good job.
B0007MWZEK|5.0|The original black Swivel Sweeper is the best!!  I love it.  I tried the new red Swivel Sweeper with the new handle, and where it bends, broke.  I purchased a second, thinking that it was just a fluke, and that handle broke also.  I have reported this, but to no avail.       Thank you Amazon for still selling the originals....  :)
B00002Z88D|5.0|This cd is amazing.  Metallica is one of the best heavy metal bands around, but this time they decided to try something different, do a live concert cd and dvd of them playing their songs with the San Francisco Orchestra, and the result was it was freaking awesome.  The mix of hard rock and classical music has always sounded amazing to me, they're should be more bands like this.  If you haven't heard this yet, which I don't see how that's possible, but if you haven't, prepare to be amazed.  Also, check out the dvd, it's equally as great.
B0058O84G0|5.0|I love Ken Follett historical novels.  They got all the right stuff: a plot of ordinary people during big historical event, writing that keeps the reader interested, and big number of pages (though carrying these books in public transport is rather tricky, thanks God for Kindle).    In this book we see the world at the beginning of 20th century and during the First World War, through the eyes of 5 families.  Each from different country and different social stand - which gave the book a special atmosphere.    However Ken Follett always had weakness to strong women, and they are so strong that it is unbelievable.  Here we have a poor sister of an English Lord, who is head of feminist's activities and in the beginning of the 20th century and during the First World War travel to Europe alone without companion.  For me hard to believe.    Otherwise, great read - looking forward for 2nd part.
B003YL4LYI|3.0|Dear George Martin. You are NOT a young man. If you need to write another 1.2M words to finish this series, I'm concerned I'll be left to write the end myself!!! Focus man, focus! (I did enjoy and devour this 5th TOME but seriously man, time to wrap it up).
0553801473|4.0|Anything written by Martin is consistently excellent, and I am a loyal fan of this series.  There are some chapters in the second half of the book that are among the best he's ever written, but I must agree with most of the reviews that say the plot goes nowhere.  Martin is just moving his characters around like chess pieces in order to get them in position for the final two books.  He should have stuck with his original plan and kept Book 4 and 5 together and edited it down a bit - fans would not have said no to buying it.  I cannot give him less than four stars for Dance, but when I was finished reading it I felt as though there should have been more going on in over 1,000 pages then there was.  Hope we don't have to wait five years for the next volume.
B004ZRV3AU|4.0|This is the second bottle cutter I have purchased and I am in love! The first one I had purchased was a pain the nehind, being as the score line would never be straight. This one, I get a straight cut time after time. NOW the tricky part of seperating the score line. I read that you fill the bottle up PAST the score line with BOILING water. I have a tea kettle, so basically, when it starts to whistle. I pull it off, fill up my mesauring cup, fill the bottle and use an ice cube right away on the score line. BE careful, holding the ice in one spot for too long can make the score line go elsewhere. Tonight, I was able to score and seperate 9 bottles out of 12. 3 ended up not working so well. But it seemed to be more with the green bottles. I did have one clear one that the score line went off, but that was my first one, I did 5 more clear bottles like that, no problems.<br /><br />NOW my complaint. The part that sits inside the bottle is starting to break, which I may have applied too much pressure. Being as rereading the book, you do not need to use a lot of pressure, which I was trying to strong arm this. BUT it still disappoints me that it does have this flaw. I will be trying to use some polymer clay to reinforce this, being as once polymer clay bakes, it's plastic anyway and this will bond to the polymer clay as well. I will update with any additional information I find out as I go along with this. ;)
B004DWKO8Y|5.0|I have been a fan of Mr. Big since their first album, and was saddened when the group broke up and went their separate ways.  This new album reunites the original members of the band - Eric Martin, Billy Sheehan, Paul Gilbert, and Pat Torpey - with a new album featuring the same epic guitar work and poetic vocals that made me love them way back in the late eighties.  I only hope this will be the beginning of a new run, and not a final flash in the pan.  Either way, this album is not one to miss.
0439023521|4.0|My daughter turned me onto this series.  She had posted a review of this book on her YA Book Review blog [..] At first, I really wasn't sure it was for me based on what my perception was of the book, but I immediately got sucked in. I read it in two days I was so compelled with the storyline.  I highly recommend this novel to anyone looking for something new, fresh, unusual but extremely engaging.<br /><br />[[ASIN:B002MQYOFW The Hunger Games]] The Hunger Games is sure to please anyone who loves a good fast paced action adventure.
B00065MDRW|5.0|This is unlike any other British rock album you'll hear. There's no thundering drums of Zeppelin or Sabbath. Nothing close to Page, Beck or Clapton's guitar. What you have however, is one of a kind music, from Greg Lake's beautiful voice to a wild and crazy, even bizarre jam at times, but it makes perfect sense as you hear. 21st Century Schizoid Man, alone, is worth a purchase of this album. This is a song with an unbelievable arrangement and pitch perfect precision on all of the instrument played that will make you go WOW!!!. Add that with other beautiful classics like \\"I talk to the wind\\", \\"Moon Child\\" and \\"Epitaph\\", you have yourself a debut album by a great band that has been loved by millions and millions around the world since 1969. An absolute must buy.

1935785079|1.0|I'm not going to comment on the translation nor treat this political tract as an intellectual contribution. It does lay out (sort of) where Hitler was coming from and what he had in mind for greater Germany, which includes Austria. His early history as he describes it is one where he's hanging out with the tough guys, brilliant in school but does not apply himself and is not too sure what he wants to do. (Other descriptions of Hitler are that he was a loner and somewhat a momma's boy, but like I said, this is a political document, and no politician is going to say other than sterling things about him/herself.)<br /><br />At the root of Adolph's political agenda is the belief that the Jews and Slavs (among others) are Untermensch.  The  Untermensch need to be weeded out of the racially pure Greater Germany. Early on in Mein Kampf, we learn that Adolph is concerned most about Austria where under the Hapsburgs, non-Aryans (primarily Slavs) are allowed to immigrate to Austria. He expresses his outrage that Arch Duke Ferdinand (who is partially to blame for this more liberal view) is assassinated by a dissident Slav. Off he goes to enlist, and by the end of the war he has reached the rank of corporal and been gassed to boot.<br /><br />His most hated target is the Jews.  Anti-semitism is nothing new to Europe, and in one of the Crusades, the Crusaders took a detour to Germany to slaughter Jews. So Adolph is chatting up a theme that has some support. Further, he convulses history to make his point by stringing together non-sequiteurs.  On the one hand the Jews are the rich bankers (capitalists) and on the other hand they're communists (the guys who want to overthrow capitalism). He points out that Marxist leaders hate the Nazis (`German Labour party') because it challenged their hold on the masses that \\"... had been exclusively at the service of international Marxism in the Jewish and Stock Exchange parties.\\" So on the one hand the Jews are Marxists and communists who want to tear down capitalism, and on the other hand the Jews are the rich bankers. That contradiction is not exactly too difficult to spot, and the book is full of such contradictions. Hardly an intellectual treatise.<br /><br />In order to sound more intellectual, Adolph enlists the quotes of the likes of Schopenhauer who is cited as describing the Jews as \\"the Great Master of Lies.\\"--in fact he uses that quote twice, just in case the readers missed it the first time. In context, Schopenhauer's comments were directed towards the religious-philosophical system of Judaism. (Hitler insists that they are a race; not a religion.) So while Adolph thinks \\"race\\" Schopenhauer is thinking \\"philosophy.\\"  More importantly, though, Schopenhauer was far more critical of German nationalism, the self-importance and \\"exceptionalism\\" that Germans gave to themselves.  So the man Adolph quotes (probably out of context) negates the vast majority of the Nazi plan that Hitler conveys in his book.<br /><br />Adolph's rant is summed up in the following:<br /><br />\\"Over against all this, the v&ouml;lkisch concept of the world recognizes that the primordial racial elements are of the greatest significance for mankind. In principle, the State is looked upon only as a means to an end and this end is the conservation of the racial characteristics of mankind. Therefore on the v&ouml;lkisch principle we cannot admit that one race is equal to another. By recognizing that they are different, the v&ouml;lkisch concept separates mankind into races of superior and inferior quality.\\"<br /><br />In a nutshell, you're either part of the \\"right\\" race or not. If not, \\"adios.\\" Ironically, Hitler may have cobbled together the \\"Honest Politician's Guide to Party Principles\\" were it not for the fact that the book's assertions are a combination of mythology, half-truths, flat out lies and unsupported bombast. Further, this frank description of his v&ouml;lkisch should have left no doubt in  any German's mind whatwas in the Nazi package. (The book was prominently placed on the folks' bookcases but may not have been read due to its turgid reading material.)<br /><br />It is true that the English translation may not have been quite as forthcoming.  Alan Cranston (who later became a US Senator) had been a foreign correspondent in Germany in the 1930s. He read the original Mein Kampf in German, and when he saw the English version on the bookstands at Macy's in New York, he immediately realized that it was a much shorter version. Upon reading it he realized that most of the crazy stuff about racial theory was omitted. So he translated the complete German version into English and sold it for a dime on News stands. It sold 500,000 copies, and as a result, Americans did learn the truth about the book. (Hitler sued Cranston over the copyright infringement, and a Connecticut court issued an injunction against Cranston.)<br /><br />As a book, Mein Kampf reads more like bad (and boring) term paper with references culled from Twitter and other sources that could be used in any context the author wants.  As an \\"important historical document,\\" it is less honest and less important than the carefully documented list of Jews executed at any of the many death camps that were set up following the plan of this book. To again quote Hitler,<br /><br />\\"We National Socialists, who are fighting for a new Weltanschhauung, must never take our stand on the famous 'basis of facts', and especially not on mistaken facts.\\" (Uhh, Adolf, make up your mind.)<br /><br />Chico Marx put it better, \\"Who you going to believe? Me or your eyes?\\"e folks' bookcases but may not have been read due to its turgid reading material.)    It is true that the English translation may not have been quite as forthcoming.

1439153663|5.0|At 7, Lavinia is an orphan in a strange land, having lost her parents onboard a ship taking the family from Ireland to America in 1790. At a loss as to what he should do with her, the captain decides to bring Lavinia home to his Virginia plantation as an indentured servant.     At Tall Oaks, Lavinia lives in the kitchen house, under the care of Belle, the captain's half-black daughter. Belle has spent her life as the surrogate daughter of a married slave couple, George and Mae, growing up with their teenage children Ben and Dory, and helping care for six-year-old twins Fanny and Beattie.     While the family is initially wary of the strange white child suddenly thrown in their midst, emotionally traumatized to the point of refusing to eat or speak, it doesn't take long for them to love her and accept her as one of their own. Lavinia, too, is eager to replace her lost family.    As the years pass, Lavinia feels truly part of her adopted family. Yet it's clear to everyone around her that her white skin will never make her a complete part of the black slaves' lives.     An opportunity arises for the adolescent Lavinia to go to New York for an education. Under the wing of the captain's wife's family, Lavinia not only learns from books, but also how to be a lady and to secure her future. While grateful for the chance, Lavinia constantly longs for home, dreaming of the day she will be reunited with her parents and siblings.     When another sudden opportunity allows Lavinia to do just that, she finds that nothing at Tall Oaks is the same. The life she once had is out of her reach, despite her best efforts to recreate it.    Amidst her growing despair and loneliness, Lavinia eventually begins to see that moving forward in a new direction is her only choice, and in doing so, she can help her loved ones and maintain many of the connections she once had.    Grissom's novel is gripping, telling the story of Lavinia and Belle in alternating chapters throughout the years, sure to remain with readers for some time.
B004XN3FHA|5.0|I bought the TK-41 to complement an array of LED \\"new technology\\" flash lights that I started this Spring.  I bought several Dorcy models with different applications in mind and they all work well for their intended purposes.  The Dorcy 41-4750 180 lumen most closely resembles the performance of the Fenix TK-41. The important difference is the 180 lumens falls between the mid and high light output range of the Fenix.  The Dorcy has a whiter light beem that also will light up objects a football field away.  Both are very good lights.  For those of you wondering if you should spend over $100 for a flash light, I would say it depends on whether you live in a very dark wide open area or plan to have many dark outdoor adventures.  I live in the woods and it's so dark that starlight makes the night sky brighter than my walking environment.  I can definately use this monster.  I classify the settings as LOW, MEDIUM, QUASAR, AND SUPERNOVA!  The regulated output is important.  Until the batteries are used up, the light output stays constant and doesn't get dimmer as the batteries get weaker.  Nice feature that may warrant the high price tag along with the two year warranty.  The ability to use easy to find AA batteries is smart.      The compartment that houses the batteries allows them to fall out with a slight jolt until you insert it into the housing and it rattles just a bit if you shake the flash light.  I wrapped one turn of black electricians tape around both ends of the compartment and completely solved this issue.  They should reengineer this for a snug fit.  Dorcy model fits perfectly and it's unbelievably light weight. Composed of plastic and rubber, it feel wonderful in your hand.  You could comfortably tote the Dorcy all night.  The Dorcy is only $20 so if your budget is limited I highly recommend it.   The Fenix has more features and has enough settings that you could get by just owning it instead of many flash lights for various applications.  They both use the same type of LED.    I use a Dorcy 41-25010 4 LED for walking around the house doing astronomy.  It emits a uniform wide white light without the bright central beam.  I keep the 13 LED Dorcy 6 volt lantern in the back of our cars in case a tire needs changing.  It will run for 40 hours and has that wide uniform white light without the central beam. The beam would be annoying for a close up task like changing a tire.    I keep the little Dorcy 41-4240 9 LED light in the glove compartment for maps and things and one in the bed for low light nocturnal excursions.  All of this works very well and there is enough great lighting for outages when they occur.  But the addition of the Fenix completes my collection because I still needed a long lasting super bright light.    I have a huge rechargable Black and Decker pistol handle that shoots out a bright wide yellowish light like a car headlight but it can only last 10 or 15 minutes then has to be recharged all night.  This new LED technology changes all that and is worth investing in.
B003EYVY0E|5.0|Well, I know some of you out there will not agree with me about this movie being my favorite of all the 8 movies, but... there is a reason why I like this one more. It is because from this one on, the franchise takes a turn into what it is supposed to be: a dark movie with scary moments and scary characters (dementors anyone?)... Being a fan of horror movies as I am, and I'm not saying this movie is a horror flick 'cause it's not; I like this movie 'cause is the beginning of a dark ride to a darker and dangerous end; and because this turn was well treated. Alfonso Cuaron did a great job with this movie taking a step in another less \\"for kids movie\\" direction into a darker unexplored territory. And this is good because that's what happen in the books too.<br />Now, the purists will want to discuss at this point about book vs. movie but let's be honest: the plot was well treated and it felt right. Except for the omitted fact about who created the patronus and why Harry's patronus is what it is. If you really want to argue about book vs. movie, let's go to the HP6 movie...<br /><br />Enough with the movie, let's talk about the product:<br />Fact: There is no extended edition whatsoever<br />Fact: The whole package is a little bit bigger than the usual size of a bluray case<br />Fact: We all would love an extended edition but let's face it; it's not gonna happen<br />But that's about it. No more cons for me to tell. I'm really glad with my Harry Potter and The Prisoner of Azkaban Ultimate Edition on Bluray. It has everything they say it had (the 2 blu's, the dvd, the collectible cards, the book, etc) all wrapped up in a fancy shiny way. All inside a very strong cardboard box, which seems very resistant so the content will be safe in there.<br />I started my HP UE collection with this movie just because I like this one. I surely will buy all the rest, in fact, HP and TOoTP is on the way now.<br /><br />If you are a fan of the Harry Potter movies, these UE's are a MUST have. You won't regret it.

B0053Q9DHW|2.0|Jane Eyre is one of my favorite books ever, but it's adapted very frequently for film and stage. The last screen adaptation was the 2006 BBC version and that was a stand out for me. But generally I think that unless a filmmaker has something special to do or say about this particular work, Hollywood might be wise to look to other classics for adaptation. However I'd heard excellent things about the most recent big screen version of Jane Eyre and after listening to an interview with the director on NPR in which he promised his new film played up the gothic elements of the story in a way that other versions hadn't, I had hopes that while it wasn't strictly necessary it might be darn good.  It's not. Not that it's terrible, it's just &#34;blah&#34;. Mia Wasikowska was miscast as Jane. For one thing she's too pretty for the role. For another I didn't get  much sense of an inner life. Not that it was bad acting per se. She smiled at the right moments and cried at the right moments, but really I got no indication of an actual personality from her Jane. Michael Fassbender was OK as Mr Rochester but nothing special. The biggest problem there is that he and Mia have very little chemistry together. Also he proposes after what seems to be three conversations. We don't get any sense of any relationship there because most of significant events are left out. If I hadn't read the book I'd have no idea why Blanche Ingram was there to begin with!  I did like Judi Dench as Mrs Fairfax and Sally Hawkins as Aunt Reed. But Mrs Fairfax and Aunt Reed shouldn't be my favorite characters!  Small choices made by the the filmmakers bothered me. For example, When Mr Rochester proposes to Jane the whole part with the lightening striking the tree is left out. Bye bye foreshadowing. Another thing I disliked was that the whole first half was told in flashback while Jane was with St John Rivers and his sisters. I was hoping that the purpose of this was to cut down on the time that was devoted to afairly dull, but necessary for plot, part of the story. But no. Even after the flashbacks end, bringing us back to the &#34;present&#34; we still need to see Jane with the Rivers' family for a while longer. And then, when she leaves (talking to Mr. Rochester's voice which she hears in the air, and looking like a lunatic) her return to Thornfield and to Mr Rochester is brushed over in about five  minutes.   When Pride and Prejudice was adapted in 2005 I complained  that looked more Bronte than Austen with it's wild, windswept moors. Well this looks more Austen than Bronte. Thornfield is a well lit house, and gardens are perfectly manicured (I thought the director said he was playing up the gothic elements!). It's worth a watch on DVD, don't get me wrong. It's not a terrible adaptation and it's pretty to look at. But I've seen much better.

Someone pointed out Lightning Bug to me the next day though, and now I wish it had animations.  Lightning bug is free without plugins, so I think it may have an edge over this app.  Though both work essentially the same way.  If the authors of the app would be so kind as to include animations in future upgrades, it would definitely get a full five stars from me.
0452289963|3.0|Eckhart Tolle respects his readers enough not to hide the source material that inspires his work.  He weaves an interfaith teaching from various religious traditions.  I don't necessarily believe the content of every page of \\"A New Earth,\\" but it does leave a lasting impression that stays with you.    Tolle claims that the many wars of human history are symptomatic of the collective ego -- the \\"us\\" versus \\"them\\" mentality which requires antagonism to sustain itself.  Tolle claims that individuals who awaken themselves to the Presence in effect dissolve away their egoes, which, he says, contributes to the flowering of human consciousness, and helps to create a new Earth.    Although its probably not a book I would read again, I'm glad to have read it once.  Tolle has a growing following for the very reason that people do derive solace from his teachings.  If you're wondering if this is just a repetition of \\"The Power of Now,\\" it isn't, it's covers new ground.  If you're looking for something more timeless, try the \\"Tao Te Ching,\\" which Tolle quotes from in chapter seven.

0307200477|1.0|It took my son weeks to demolish his first little version of this beloved book, which also had the plastic comb binding. I bought this one thinking it was bound in some other manner. It is a \\"deluxe\\" version, and even has a few pages that the first version we got (with stuffed rabbit included) did not have, but with in 15 minutes of his looking at it by himself, my 19 month old son (who has not destroyed any other book, ever) had this one separated from the hard cover, and now it's just the pages, which will soon be all apart as well. I'm serious, it took only a few minutes of his turning the pages by himself, quietly. I could sit down and work each plastic curl back into the holes of the cover, or I could take the whole plastic comb out and find some other way to hold it together, but I don't know what to do except look for another format of this book he loves, while trying to find a way to keep it in one piece just a little longer. This is a ridiculous way to put together a book for anyone under age 7. And I rarely leave reviews like this, I try and resolve the issue with the manufacturer but we have waited months for this book, and it's come apart in 15 minutes??? This is my first ever one star review, and it's sad, because this is a fantastic book.

I was laughing out loud when I got to the part where Matthew gave Diana the ridding getup and of course it fit perfectly, cause in this book everyone is perfect.
141931176X|2.0|Gorgeous painting, deeper appreciation of art; mediocre, annoying book<br /><br />This is a book that fictionalizes what might have been behind the famous Vermeer painting, \\"Girl with a Pearl Earring\\".  Griet's family is destitute, and now she must work as a maid in the Vermeer household, cleaning up the famous painter's workstation.  Slowly, she grows more interested in her master, and her master in her.<br /><br />I am not what you would call an artsy person.  I make an effort to decorate my home nicely, I can pick out nice yarns for knitting and crocheting (according to a pattern), and I am fairly decent at picking clothes that don't clash, but that is as far as my \\"artistic abilities\\" go.  You wouldn't find me in an art museum for fun, unless my sister, the artsy one in the family, drug me there.  So when I say that this book made me look up Vermeer, analyze his work, and actually grow more appreciative of it, I think it's a somewhat big deal.<br /><br />And, though I really hate to say this, that is the biggest reason I am giving this book two stars.  Because a book that makes me look up a historical figure, investigate his work, and actually start to like it deserves to have SOME kudos.  If you take that aspect of the book away, you are left with a medicore book, populated with annoying/cliched characters with virtually no plot to speak of.<br /><br />Griet is our protagonist, and there were several times I was hoping she would drown in her washing or set herself on fire or accidentally fall between the butcher and his blade.  I understand she's young, but I didn't realize she was A) a 10 year old child (she acts way younger, more sheltered, and more immature than her 17 years would indicate), B) a spoiled, wealthy child suddenly thrown into poverty (though her father lost his trade, I never got the impression they were wealthy before this book), or C) hideously emo (she tends to wangst about not seeing her parents, about the \\"secrets\\" she has to hide, and she faints after piercing her ear).  Her first day working for the Vermeers, she whines that the first time she smiled all day is when she saw a familiar butcher's face.  Booohooo.  She is stupid, keeping an expensive comb anywhere within a 12 mile radius of a bratty child who wants to wreak havoc on Griet's life.  She is dense as a brick, selfish, ungrateful, and unemotional (she is never shown loving or caring at all for Pieter, which makes the ending seem weird).  And yet somehow, this girl garners the attention of THREE men and the hatred of SEVERAL women.  She's better at cleaning, cooking, caring for Vermeer's studio, making paint, buying meat, AND arranging items in Vermeer's paintings (yes, it is SHE that comes up with the earring idea for the titular painting and rearranges the cloth for another painting).  Griet, come on down, you've won the Mary Sue of the Month award!<br /><br />The other characters are two dimensional at best.  Catharina is a b!tch, mean to Griet just because.  I am really sick and tired of this cliche: of having the female of the house hate the \\"poor girl\\" just because, well, that's what the female of the house is supposed to do, I guess.  I ended up feeling SORRY for Catharina, because I felt she was desperately trying to win her husband's attention by having so many children.  Cornelia is a demon; her actions venture way beyond \\"Terrible Child\\" into \\"Spawn of the Devil\\".  One character dies just to include some more angst and a thin relation to the Plague.  Vermeer is a complete enigma.  I can understand retaining some mystery around him, but when you finish the book with as many questions as you began, something is wrong.  I have no idea what he saw in Griet, how he felt towards her, and who he was.  Van Ruijven is a stereotypical CAD; Tenneke is stupid (she can't tell when Griet is sucking up to her??  Yeah, right!).  Pieter started out a nice guy, but when he feels up Griet against her will, I just felt cold.  Their entire relationship is awkward: he seems really keen on her, very nice, yet she wants nothing to do with him.  But then, after Vermeer sees her hair loose, she is okay with having sex with Pieter???  Huh???<br /><br />The story is so bland and stereotypical, it's absurd.  How many times have we seen the \\"X must take a job because X's father/provider can't work\\" or something along these lines?  It wouldn't be bad if there was SOMETHING to make it different, but Griet never gives an indication of what she is missing out on nor does her story make this plot line interesting.  Instead, all she does is whine about how rough her hands are, how much her back hurts, how much work she has to do, how bloody the butcher is, how all the women hate her, etc.<br /><br />And what makes Griet so special that Vermeer pays her any mind?  I got a glimpse when Griet arranges vegetables, and I actually liked a scene where Griet and Vermeer discussed colors in white, but other than that, there is nothing between them.  Well, there IS Griet's feelings for Vermeer, but because I saw so little of Vermeer, I always got the impression she had a major crush on Vermeer and he was just smitten with her in an artistic sense.<br /><br />As for all the secrets...come on, people, what gives?  Why is it such a big deal that Griet helping Vermeer create paint?  Why do they go to such efforts to keep it a secret?  Why the big deal about the painting Vermeer does of Griet?  Is it because of the possibility of an affair?  If so, why did Catharina have no problem with Vermeer painting the butcher's daughter or van Ruijven's family?  Vermeer is painting her to get paid; you would think Catharina would have enough sense to be okay with that, but apparently, no!  (In fact, if she were a REALLY interesting character, she might see Griet's painting potential and FORCE her to sit so they could make more money!)  If people actually TALKED to each other, instead of hiding stupid things like this, there wouldn't BE a story.<br /><br />The ending actually isn't bad.  I liked how she moved on and wasn't still harping (too much) on Vermeer.  Though there were still a few things that bugged me (SPOILER FRIENDLY: her marriage, what she did with Vermeer's final gift to her).<br /><br />I suppose if you are really curious about Vermeer and his background and don't mind a fluffy, almost Young Adult approach to it, this is your book.  But if Mary Sues, flat characters, and an almost non-existent story hold you back, you may want to skip.  I will give this book credit: it was a fast listen (I \\"read\\" on audiobook) and made me more interested in the artist.<br /><br />UPDATE 9/12/11: I recently watched the movie starring Scarlett Johansson and Colin Firth and was pleased at how well it was adapted to movie format.  This isn't something I often say, but I definitely preferred the movie over the book.<br /><br />Brought to you by:<br />*C.S. Light*er, very nice, yet she wants nothing to do with him.

193413712X|2.0|Ranganathan's third law of librarianship coined the phrase \\"every book its reader,\\" which is something I had to keep reminding myself as I read this slender Pulitzer-winning novel. I'm sure there are many many readers out there (including, obviously, the Pulitzer Prize committee) who love this kind of carefully crafted, highly honed, meditative fiction -- but I am not one of them. I like my fiction to be more plot-driven, with prose that makes you sit up and take notice . Instead, the book is a series of deathbed flashbacks from an elderly man who lies dying, surrounded by his family. The man repairs antique clocks, and obviously the passage of time and memory is a huge theme here. We learn bits and pieces about his father, who took a cart into the back country to sell notions door to door, and his grandfather, an ineffectual minister. Don't get me wrong, there are some fine scenes and fragments of interesting details -- but no story. I keep returning to the word \\"crafted\\", and as with other art forms, I can appreciate the presence of fine craftsmanship while not actually enjoying the results. I suppose I tend to prefer fiction on the more organic and messy side, preferably with a story or character that hooks me. Anyway, like many prize-winners, this one wasn't for me.

B0055PMUSU|5.0|Break out the Kleenex! Bethany Hamilton should be an inspiration to anyone who hears her story. She is one of those people who refuse to let anything get in their way - either physically or mentally. There have been countless people like her who not only overcame a tragedy - but went on to do truly amazing things. I believe that it's not what you go through - it's how you go through it - that will either make or break you.<br /><br />I cried quite a few times while watching this. Her range of emotions following a sudden \\"disability\\" that threatened to limit her great aspirations reminded me of my husband. He lost his vision 26 years ago, and then was diagnosed with advanced Hodgkin's lymphoma shortly after that. He beat it like a champ, and was back to work the minute he was able. He pushed forward and excelled despite on-going, life-threatening health issues. He rarely complained or felt sorry for himself, but when he did he'd actually apologize, feel horrible about it and then resolve himself to use his unique experiences to do something inspiring and positive.<br /><br />Last year he survived non-Hodgkins lymphoma and B-cell follicular cancer by undergoing a stem cell transplant. His body had been through so much for so long, and that ordeal was nothing short of a living hell for him. The radiation he received at age 19 caused second and third degree burns from head to toe due to the radical chemotherapy that was necessary to save him at age 45. \\"Radiation recall\\" often leads to death because it is similar to being severely burned by a fire ... and in his case it was both internally and externally.<br /><br />But he trudged through it and jumped right back into his music career three months after the transplant. Last night, a little over a year later, his band opened for a nationally acclaimed act and the show was sold out.<br /><br />NEVER GIVE UP!
1933633867|5.0|When I was linked this book on Amazon, I wasn't sure what to expect. I originally saw it as a history of debt, but the book is much more than that - it's an explanation of debt in a broader historical context, something that, as far as I know, has never been done before.     The book is very accessible, and breaks down difficult to understand ideas (for me, modern monetary theory) into piece-by-piece explanations that end up giving you a greater understanding than anything else I've come across. Everybody should read this book, and I hope that Mr. Graeber gets the recognition he deserves.

B0050PYNOY|3.0|David Gordon Green Danny McBride, and James Franco struck gold with PINEAPPLE EXPRESS, a stoner comedy for the new age (personally, I only thought it was so-so, but that's my humble opinion).  Naturally, when you have a critically- and commercially-successful film about smoking pot, it raises the question: what if we did a stoner comedy set in the Middle Ages?<br /><br />The result is the rambling, imperfect, but occasionally hilarious YOUR HIGHNESS.  It follows to brothers: bumbling Thadeus (McBride) and heroic Fabious (Franco), the latter of whose wife (Zooey Deschanel) is kidnapped by an evil sorcerer (Justin Theroux).  The two brothers set out to find the princess, teaming up along the way with a Xena-wannabe (Natalie Portman).  They encounter monsters, mayhem, and horny minotaurs.  And that's just for starters.<br /><br />There are a lot of laughs in YOUR HIGHNESS--a lot of truly low-brow, jaw-hurting laughs, the kind you find yourself quoting to your buddy: \\"Hey, remember the part when...?\\"  The problem is, the movie in its entirety just seems...two-dimensional.  Whether you liked it or didn't, PINEAPPLE EXPRESS at least had some decent character development to it, and solid chemistry between Seth Rogen and Franco.  McBride and Franco's chemistry is interesting but not too deep; and Portman seems to be on a completely different plane than either of her costars.  Theroux doesn't seem to quite know what to do (he's great in some spots, shoddy in others), and Deschanel literally has nothing to do except look pretty and act distressed.  There are some great supporting players here (Toby Jones, Charles Dance, Damian Lewis), but this isn't an actors' film: it's a writer's film, an improv film, and as such, great acting talent has minimal effect.<br /><br />So why the three stars, you're wondering?  Mainly because, when those gut-bursting laughs come, they're fantastic.  You can see most of them coming a mile away, but the payoff is still there.  If I were to classify this film, I'd list it as a rental (if anyone truly \\"rents\\" anymore), and you can take it from there.  YOUR HIGHNESS isn't the greatest stoner comedy of all time, but it's certainly not as bad as critics seemed to suggest.  If you're into low-brow humor, then you'll find a few things worth watching here.as a rental (if anyone truly \\"rents\\" anymore), and you can take it from there.

1400052181|5.0|\\"The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks\\" shocked me so much I had to get up and walk around the block.  The author investigative skills were beyond anything I can think of.  Johns Hopkins Hospital sounds like a pit out of hell.  Was the poor health treatment of Henrietta Lacks because she was African-American.  Yes, it was.  Were the cell profits sucked up by white greed? Yes!  And the evilness and greed has not stopped yet. Makes me want to holler!!<br /><br />To the author, Thank you!  To the Lacks family, I sob and pray. To Johns Hopkins Hospital and all your dirty deeds, still you suck every federal grant you can get and did and do not follow the true mission and the purpose of Hopkins, to help the poor, the orphans, and sadly it includes so many of us, African-Americans.
B00005K9LK|5.0|This must be one of the... top three? Heavy Metal albums in history: an equivalent in power, speed and feeling to Iron Maiden's \\"Powerslave\\". A record that can make you push a little too hard on the gas of your ridiculously old Mustang. A must-have, and a must-know-lyrics-in-order-to-shout-them-through-the-window.    Now, it's true that, as for almost any of these remasters from the 70's or 80's, overall volume of the recording is slightly low. Also, the two or three newly added songs are actually unnecessary: at least for me, the listening experience for a record this integral and important feels interrupted by the adding of any \\"live take\\" of a song that you already listened 30 minutes ago in it's proper order.    But maybe this is just me. So I give it the whole 5 stars.

0553801473|2.0|GRRM is rightly known for killing off some of his major characters, to major dramatic effect in AGOT and ASOS. Now, it almost seems like he wants to kill off the entire series! It is impossible to disagree with the many reviewers who point out that there is no major plot advancement. The fact that characters are suddenly (over)using expressions they did not use before in the series is jarring. GRRM introduces more characters than he knows what to do with and has some of the old ones undergo disappointing transformations. For example, the most interesting character in all of fantasy, Tyrion Lannister, has devolved into a third-rate circus attraction. The Dorne plot was a major red herring (more like a red whale actually, considering the many pages devoted to it both in AFFC and ADWD) and Daenerys has become as boring as Brienne was in AFFC. The many POVs make it difficult to form a coherent understanding--and enjoyment of--the overall story.<br /><br />That said, after having finished the book, I reread the Reek/Theon chapters in order; read this way, they provide a compelling story arc and show the Martin of old. It is on these chapters that I am basing my hope that Martin can pull it together for the next installment. He will definitely need a good editor, though.
B004KSQN7C|4.0|Her music is about as entertaining as her life. It's pop and makes you want to dance. The \\"lyrics\\" are comical, yet I keep listening. If you're reading this, you probably have a soft spot for Britney and will be buying this album anyways. If you hate Britney, I'm not sure why you're reading this review. Anyways, Britney is changing with the popular sensations again and I enjoyed it.
0061537969|5.0|My dad read this book and insisted I read it as well, even going so far as to purchase it for me and insist that I begin reading it while he was visiting me.  I did, and I couldn't put it down, I finished it in just a couple of days.  I'm an absolute dog person, and in reading Enzo's story I couldn't help but wonder what's going on in the minds of my own dogs and their take on our life.  Enzo is a smart, witty, caring, loving, protective dog, and even though he's a dog, one can relate to him in the human sense.  He's a wonderful storyteller, a dog who longs to come back in  his next life as a man.  I would laugh out loud at his lament of not having thumbs, cry when he was feeling frightened or pain, and want to shout out when he knew things going on that his human family had no clue about.  He takes you on the wonderful journey that was his life with his beloved owner Denny, who experiences so many ups and downs yet always has Enzo to rely on, in every situation.<br /><br />You don't have to be a dog lover to enjoy this book, but if you are, you will absolutely love it.  If you aren't a dog person when you finish this book you just might become one, it's hard not to fall in love with Enzo, dog person or not.
1591843790|5.0|I read Enchantment on the recommendation of a friend and was truly enchanted - by Mr. Kawasaki himself! He came as a guest to an online book club that I hosted for Enchantment and was fabulous! He tweeted responses to my questions with all the guests. He embodies each of the warm, smart and funny things that he teaches in this book. The lessons are for business but are also practical for your life as well.<br /><br />One of the ideals that Guy talks about is \\"embracing the nobodies\\" not the A-listers. And I am here to tell you that is what he does himself. Another lesson is plant many seeds which is perfect for Social Media. Everyday you plant many, many seeds. I learned so many things that I use everyday.<br /><br />I will definitely re-read Enchantment and highly recommend that you read it as well.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|Excellent keyboard replacement. I used keyboard pro, swypy, &amp; stock Droid and htc. The app has great prediction algorithm. Just wish it gave actual smily previews.
1596680296|4.0|If you never knitted socks before this is a good book to buy. She has very good instructions and explanations. I hadn't knitted a sock in my 3 years of knitting and so far knitted one with this book. She has great tips and samples of other techniques so you are aware of the other possiblilites in knitting a sock.  I didn't like having to flip from the pattern to the beginning chapters to find out how to do what I was supposed to do, but if it showed the photos every time I guess the book would be a lot bigger and cost more. :-)
B002SEW5WW|5.0|Typical One Republic, good listen. Bought the album, because I'm a sucker for the single Good Life. The other songs definitely made this purchase worth it.

B004J4WLPU|5.0|This thriller novel is told in excellent, top form! Was the death of a young woman murder or suicide? We are guessing to the end in a captivating choice of story telling here, through the dead woman's sister's mind and emotions This book is chilling, exciting, touching, and in the end, we come away with more character within ourselves. Told in fascinating style. Brilliant writing.

0240815807|4.0|If your looking to go to the next level with your home recording, this is THE book for you. I guarantee you'll get something out of it. The author covers everything from monitor speakers to individual DAW plug-ins (and everything in between).    I would have given this book 5 stars but I didn't because it was like \\"drinking from a firehose\\" at times. I wish I could have picked 4.5 stars. In my opinion, there is so much information in this book that it makes it almost discouraging to read. If you understand everything he's talking about, odds are you already ARE a mixing professional (or close to it). I understand that the author wants to help you produce recordings that are comparable to large studios, but man, sometimes my head just started to spin.    This thing is jam-packed with ideas and suggestions. I was immediately able to clean up some of the low end of my recordings by using a high-pass filter on my tracks. It seems obvious when you think about it, but it just never crossed my mind. I've struggled with that issue for a while and now I know how to fix it. That's just one example, there are a TON more.    I'd buy it again but probably drink a 64oz redbull before starting the read.

0894803123|5.0|Ben Cohen and Jerry Greenfield not only share their best recipes in this book.  With dozens of delicious dessert instructions, that alone would have been enough.  They also use this book to tell the Ben & Jerry's story, and it's a good story, told with a lot of wit and humor and illustrated in their familiar style.  My family had as much fun laughing over the anecdotes filling this book as we did eating the ice cream we made.
B001VLXNLU|5.0|I had really mixed feelings about reading this book given all the bad review but I gave it a try. I cannot agree more about the dialogue it really does feel like a forty year old trying way too hard. part of me is wondering what kind of editor would let that slide. no one talks like that not any generation for that matter and it really annoyed me but I tried to just accept it and focus on the plot and that's when i began to enjoy the novel. I think for the price it's all right I don't think is the greatest book but i don't have any buyer's remorse either. I think if you just want a light amusing read this is for you the key here is don't expect too much and you won't be disappointed it's not terrible and again considering the price its decent. the plot is intriguing enough that I finished the book despite the teen dialogue. just buy one book at a time and take it from there.

B001H9MYPW|5.0|i just finished watching the dvd box. how amazing!!!!! i loved it even more than season one. the characters seem more interesting to me (i was so annoyed by laura in season one - i just couldn't stand her), and more deeply and profoundly drawn. i even cannot decide who is my favourite character in that season. unfortunately, the sound came out quite bad on my player, but maybe that was just me.  highly recommended to everyone who is interested in psychology/therapy - and of course for all the fans of gabriel byrne (who is spectacular as dr. weston)!
B003Y5H51K|2.0|This movie was way over-hyped. Nothing special about this movie. Go spend your money on THE CAVE. Sanctum feels like The Cave but without any horror, feels like a documentary gone bad. I will not rent nor buy this movie, wasted my time watching it via Netflix.
0545265355|5.0|My sister told me to check out The Hunger Games when I wanted a quick summer read. As soon as I picked up the first book I was hooked- once you start reading these it is hard to stop.   If you enjoy a teen-lit page turner (Harry Potter, Twilight) you will almost certainly like the Hunger Games. Look out for the movie :)

B003YL4LYI|5.0|I'm not sure if this book was the best in the series, but it is one of the best without doubt. Especially after the major disappointment of book 4. It hard to remember the first couple, but I don't remember enjoying any book in the series as much as this one.....
0062060554|5.0|I loved this book.  It almost feels strange to say that you enjoyed it due to it's horrific subject matter, but enjoy it I did.  From the first paragraph I was hooked.  Could not put it down, even when common sense was telling me to go to bed or I was going to be a very tired and cranky person in the morning.  It's actually a very clever premise.  And even though it's been done to death in various forms, the author tweaked it just enough to make it feel fresh again.  The main character, Christine, wakes up every day not remembering the last twenty odd years.  She has to learn who she is, and where she is, every single morning.  The novel is written in first person, and I wondered how the story would be told if it's being told by someone that does not remember what has happened previously.  The author cleverly takes care of that conundrum by making her lead character a writer herself.  At the suggestion of a doctor she has begun writing everything that happens to her in a journal.  The doctor calls her every morning and convinces her that he is her doctor, and that she has a journal hidden in her house that she has been writing in every day.  So the entire story is told through her journal entries.  This could of gotten really tedious, but making her an accomplished writer allows the author to write creatively, without being too unbelievable.  The story flies right along as she learns truth after truth, and can remember them now, from day to day, in the form of her journal entries.  The only flaw is that the ending is a little too nicely wrapped in a bow to be realistic.  The author saves it from this fate with the last sentence.  And you will need to read the book to see what I mean.
B002U33GUQ|2.0|Brad Mehldau is undeniably gifted, but I have never been much of a fan of his CD's.  I've found them to be over-conceptualized, albeit very well-performed.  I never got with the the ornate arrangements of  jazz standards and pop tunes.  But  that's me.     Even so, I had high hopes for this project, because of who was involved.  The snippets I heard sounded promising.  But when I sat down and listened, it just did not jell for me.  Everybody played well, of course--how could they not?-- but  the music itself occupied some place that was neither here nor there.  I found the string arrangements to be obtrusive and kinda corny.  It made me long for those somewhat-overproduced CTI records, which in retrospect sound pretty great.  Also, and this is just personal taste, I found Joshua Redman's contributions to be a bit annoying.  Obviously it was what was wanted, but I didn't care for it.          And did this NEED to be a double CD?  A bit indulgent, methinks. They could easily have whittled it down to a decent single CD. Too much of any meal, good or bad, and you become bloated. Again, this is obviously my own opinion, and again  I came to this with a positive spirit.  But I really could not get all the way through it.   I guess Brad was  pleased with it, so....  what the heck do I know???
B001FB4W0W|4.0|...then what are you waiting for. This series has a HUGE following. Millions of viewers. I got 4 people hooked on this show because I let them borrow this series. Not your typical Twilight high school drama.<br /><br />Lots of blood, nudity, story, and all sorts of twists. The characters are awesome. The seasons get better each year.
B0055EDCGU|5.0|There are two types of Trivium records: where they try to be heavy, and where they try to be friendly. Ascendancy and Shogun (and Ember) were albums that tried to be heavy (and were pretty good), Crusade was more of a friendly album (which failed).<br /><br />I would also call In Waves a more friendly, less heavy-striving record. But somehow this time they managed to nail it. IW may be remembered as the best record in their collection, because it will be extremely hard to top.<br /><br />Trivium got loose, and in the process wrote some all-time epics. The title track is one that will bounce stadiums for a generation. Caustic Are The Ties That Bind has a metal chorus that you'll sing in your dreams.<br /><br />The next tier of great tracks alone would have made this the best Trivium yet. Dusk Dismantled, Chaos Reigns, Inception of the End, all fantastic tracks, all totally heavy and unafraid.<br /><br />The Special Edition even has 18 tracks and you won't skip over any of them. The band knows how to put together quality songs, period.<br /><br />In Waves is the biggest and the best mainstream metal has to offer. The heaviness and song-writing are at a natural and optimum level. No top-tier band can match Trivium at this point.
B00065JTBA|5.0|This is the 1st review I have ever done on any site. But after finishing all 4 discs of this set. I am amazed.   I have always been a big fan of Bon Jovi, and after this, I am a huge fan. I resisted buying this when it 1st came out for all the reasons I have read in previous reviews. I expected it to be just a re-work of all previous material. WOW! Far from that. This set contains some of the most creative and insightful songs I've heard from Bon Jovi. Almost everything is unreleased and sounds just as good as their studio stuff. I just completed putting 40 of the 50 songs on my iPod, and can't wait to start listening to these 4 discs again. So much to hear, so much to enjoy. I would have to say that discs 2 & 4 are my favorites, but the other 2 are great too.   If you are wondering about this purchase, don't. You won't be disappointed. I purchased mine from an Amazon Merchant for about $20 w/shipping. Like new condition, and I feel that I stole it. Recently, I haven't enjoyed music more than I have this set. Don't wait any longer. Get it for your collection while it is still available a good price. You definately won't be sorry. I know I'm not!

B003AJKPL2|5.0|I had an immediate and recurring need to pit cherries and got this unit for the job. It's mostly plastic, with a nicely formed and finished steel piece that is responsible for pushing out the pits. On the rear is a push/pull tab that locks the unit in the closed position to ease storing. In the place where the cherries go sits a soft, rubbery, silicone-ish piece that firmly locates the cherry and helps save it from being deformed when the pit is pushed out. I went through a box of cherries without losing a single one. Cut a few of them in half to have with my yogurt and sat down to a nice cherry-infused breakfast, thanks to this little gizmo. I have nothing but respect and praise. I'll try to get to an olive test soon, but I have no reason to expect any different result.<br /><br />Olive Update *********<br /><br />Well, after less than a year at work pitting olives and occasionally cherries, the inner rubbery piece cracked, allowing unpitted olives to push through, then totally gave up the ghost and pushed through itself with an olive being pitted. Everything about this device impressed me, including it's operation as both olive and cherry pitter. It turned out to be stupid old reliability that wasn't up to scratch. Over the time limit for a painless return, too. Rats - thought for a while I had a dual solution, but it looks like it's back to the marketplace for a second try. Arrrgh!<br /><br />Replacement Update ***********<br /><br />Shortly after my Arrrhg! related to returning, I read somewhere that the pitter (and all other Cuisipro devices) have a lifetime guarantee/warranty. I looked up their number on the internet, called them up, and arranged with the customer service person to have a replacement shipped to my address (at no cost). It arrived in due time, and seems to work just fine. I'm guessing that somewhere they're redesigning that collar that broke, but for now I'm happy at my specific outcome, though it would have been nice to avoid the trip in the first place. The olive people are coming for Thanksgiving, so it will get another workout and I'll report if things go other than totally OK.irst place.

B000ENWKN8|4.0|SO.  What we have here is something pretty different from \\"Hellbilly Deluxe\\" or \\"The Sinister Urge.\\"  Those two albums are almost one in the same - with the latter possibly hinting at the expansion/change in sound that was to come.  Regardless, both of those albums are loved by fans and both are a good example of extremely heavy/industrial-like metal.  This is not the case on \\"Educated Horses.\\"  While many reviews seem to feel that this simple fact must deem the album worthless or weak, it is a trait that can be celebrated.  Quite frankly, I'm not sure Rob Zombie would be such a talented musician/director if he stuck to one thing over and over - beating a dead horse if you will.  If you want Hellbilly Deluxe go listen to it.  If you want White Zombie go listen to it.  Here - we have Rob giving us something else to listen to.  T<br /><br />The album is very organic sounding.  You can tell it's a full band as opposed to drum machines and click tracks.  I'll add that the amazing guitar master John 5 is on this album - which in and of itself should be a reason to pick it up.  Rob sounds a lot like Alice Cooper on this album - which just goes to show his vocal range.  Nonfans should find that, love him or hate him, he has more range than the growls you hear on earlier records.  Moreover, there is a lot that should satisfy fans of the old stuff.  \\"American Witch\\" is a very heavy and aggressive song - though not industrial - but this record is more about grooves, which can be found in the catchy \\"The Scorpion Sleeps.\\"  \\"Let it All Bleed Out\\" should satisfy old fans as well, with its chugging riffs and growling vocals.  I love Rob Zombie - I love his movies and his live show and his studio albums.  I don't think I'd respect him as much if his four solo studio albums were all retreads of \\"Hellbilly Deluxe.\\"  I recommend getting all his albums plus the live album and \\"House of 1000 Corpses\\" soundtrack for some real enjoyment.  Speaking of other albums, \\"Hellbilly Deluxe 2\\" seems to get a lot of criticism but that's another one to check out.  Again, not if you want an exact duplicate of its predecessor - but if you're open to an evolving sound that is reminiscent of the old stuff - you need look no further.et a lot of criticism but that's another one to check out.

0802473156|4.0|Although the book is loved by my friends and me, there is nothing too out of the ordinary about this book. The positive is majorly the way it classified the love needs of people. I liked the guides it had about how to please the people of certain classification. And really that is about it.    The writing was very simple. Thus, people whose first or even second language is not English understood the book's contents. Since the content isn't heavy or too new, I used to read it before sleep.     Do read it if you are in a relationship and want a simple read. Do check out its website before ordering.
030746363X|5.0|Well I am reviewing after trying. After years of trying different things to lose fat (I have been as high as 245lbs and I am 5-11\\" and currently 46 years young) and I can say switching to the Slow Carb diet has really helped me to drop the weight to the point that people are just amazed and complimenting me all the time on my body transformation. I currently plateud at 21% bf and started doing the KB Swings twice a week and some supplimental exercises. In just a week I have lost 4\\" more in overall body mass by implementing the KB Swings. I haven't even touched the STACK Formula suggested, but I do cold packs on my shoulder and neck about 3-5x a week. Plus protein powder just as soon as I wake up. My blood pressure is normal now (never was before). So to all those who are reading negative reviews... just note if the reviewer said they tried the program and for how long. I am looking forward to doing more of the book for the other body hacks, but for right now, weight loss is my goal. Wish to get to 17% bf or below... I no longer look at my weight but my fat percentage. I also don't think of myself as fat anymore. The one thing that Tim didn't put in his book that I found very helpful was using some program on my Smart Phone to record my basic meals so I could follow my calorie count. That really helped to speed along progress. Any of the other exercises I have done.. in case you were wondering was Spin Classes, Walking an hour at a time or treadmill running for 30 min and finishing with a 4 min sprint, Carry a 60 lb sandbag around the block  once in awhile, weight lifting, hitting a tire with a sledge hammer. I do these on and off as I feel like it.. Not more than one of those exercises in a day.

(just try to NOT -think...'tiny tim')   but ohmy - so beautiful -   his voice - the combination  of voice and instrument sounds is so   clear and true - it's breath taking.  I like listening to this cd in the kitchen  while cooking something yummy for my   family - makes me feel good in every way.

B002ZGW9KG|4.0|I loved it the first time I saw it on tv when I was a kid. Alan Arkin played a creepy villain. Audrey is great in this movie. She made it very believable that she was blind. They just don't make thrillers like this anymore. Reminded me of a Hitchcock film. The ending is guaranteed to make you jump.
0439023521|5.0|This book had me from the first paragraph. It's amazing. It's sad how sleeping and daily activities tended to get in the way of my reading this book! I had to get the rest of the trilogy too.
B000FC1GJW|5.0|I'm a slow reader, and finally read through all of books in this series. The last book by far opens your mind to so many directions the story could go. And then, it changes to a direction you would not think of! Great adventure with a true love story intertwined between the lines.

B005EI86JU|5.0|Darrell Young has done it again.  Delivered a book, Mastering the D7000, with a WOW factor.  I've owned my D7000 for nine or ten months, and have been using it with only rudimentary understanding of this complex, wonderful camera.  I've never been much for camera manuals. I try to find how to do something and I am referred to multiple pages, which end up just confusing me.    Mastering the D7000 explains the functions of the D7000 in language even I can understand. This book is like a blessing delivered to me.  Buy it, and it will bless you.    Betty
B001E45XT4|5.0|I ordered these the 6th of August and received them the 8th, so the shipping was completely fast and inexpensive! The headphones get a 5/5 because for the price, i did not expect them to be this well built and have a good sound quality as well.    The mic fits tightly into the slot on the left side of the headset, ideal for storage, the headset is somewhat tight (especially if you happen to have a big head), but can be adjusted. The control panel on the cord allows you to chose between 5 volume settings, and this headset can get pretty loud! The quality is amazing, and for the price a real steal, i was somewhat worried about purchasing this product due to some of the negative reviews, but i must say this is a great buy and a beautiful headset, very stylish and modern.    To anyone looking for a headset that won't cost you a lot of money, this is a huge bang for your buck.  Pros:   Terrific quality  Stylish  Great material, won't break easily  Perfect mic storage and quality  Great price!!!    Cons:  Tight fit
B0052VUNHC|5.0|I can't believe how much I loved this book!  Ordinarily I don't like YA books, but these characters feel much older -- they just happen to be in college.  I can't tell you how many times I reread this book in the two days after I bought it.      I wanted to be unhappy with the underage drinking and illegal fighting, but the characters are so compelling that you fall in love with them, flaws and all.    I wish this book would be made available in print -- I prefer to read books in print -- but it's so wonderful that even those who dislike e-books should grab this one.
B000XUBC5E|5.0|I am now reading this book and so far like it very much.I am new o kindle and think it is the greatest invention.
0375842209|5.0|I got this for my summer reading assignment, and it really is a wonderful and inspirational book. I'm not gonna go into detail; don't wanna spoil anything.   It came in the mail 2 days after I ordered with the standard shipping, so that's a plus. It just came in a manila colored bag with a little bubble wrap on the inside. I was expecting a box with some air-filled bags like the last time I ordered a book, but I guess you don't need that much to protect a 500 page book, do you.  The binding wasn't ripped, and the covered weren't folded. No damage during the shipping process.  I'm very satisfied and I would totally recommend this book to anyone. It's truly a great, great book.
B0055V0HXO|5.0|When I saw that Karmakanic was releasing a new album, I said great news.  Although I enjoy The Flower Kings to an extent, I always have a very difficult time getting past Hasse Froberg's voice (only my opinion).  I can tolerate Ronie Stolt as I think he has done an exceptional job lending vocal duties to Transatlantic.  With Karmakanic, Goran Edman, I think, delivers a very solid performance vocally and seems easier on the ear.  From the opening track '1969' to the ending track of 'When Fear Came to Town' each track really delivers.  Once again, this is a very solid release from this group and for those of you who have followed them since their first album 'Entering the Spectre' you will not disappointed.  The bonus track 'Turn it Up (Radio Edit)' is thrown in, but why would you need that when you already have the full version?  That would be my only negative throughout the album.  I would have rather have had another track in place of the radio edit.  Anyway, this would be a must buy for some new, great progressive rock.
0553801473|1.0|I am the biggest fan of ASOIAF that you will find. The reason I'm such a big fan however is because of the amazing quality of the first three novels.  I consider A Storm of Swords to be the greatest book I've ever read. A Feast Crows did not live up to the hype and ended up being a massive disappointment. With that said, I still had hope that GRRM could right the ship. Unfortunately, A Dance with Dragons is the worst book he has written yet. It is a book of pointless filler where almost nothing important happens.  Too many chapters are simply unnecessary chapters where the character starts at one point and the chapter ends with him/her still at the same point. There is little development whatsoever with ANY of the characters. There are a few good moments and surprises but not nearly enough to live up to Martin's books.<br /><br />I waited 6 years for this novel and got a 1000 page book in which everything important that took place could have been completely summarized in less than 5 pages. Yes I'm serious, that's how little took place in this book.  Gone are the huge surprises, the big battles and the sense of awe that you used to get while reading these books. When I read the first three books there were many moments where I just had a blank look on my face and thought \\"Wow\\". These looks and feelings of awe have been replaced by feelings of boredom and yawns.  ASOIAF looked like it was destined to become the greatest Fantasy series of all time but that has all gone out the window. Martin can still regain it however if he can deliver in the next book unlike with the past two.<br /><br />Martin is still the best fiction writer alive today but if it takes multiple years to release the next book, I'm going to give up on him. It's criminally expensive to buy a hardcover book these days.

B0055B0MIO|4.0|When listening to the new album, if you've had a good listen to all of Trivium's previous material, you'll be able to easily pick up on the different styles from each album found in these songs. There's a little bit of everything in this album, from softer almost ballad-like songs to borderline death metal tracks. While this album isn't bad in any sense of the word, those expecting a second offering of 'Shogun' or a reboot of 'Ascendancy' will not be getting what they hoped for. This album is not Trivium trying to remake a specific sound they've already done before. This album is about Trivium taking everything they've ever done and compressing it into neat little package. It's like taking a two hour lecture and downsizing it to a twenty minute power-point presentation, where only the bare necessities are present to make sure that the point is made to the listener without adding an unnecessary amount of additional content. Which is why the songs on this album are a lot shorter than those found on Shogun.    However, like myself, most of you didn't mind the length of the songs on Shogun, because they were amazing from beginning to end. However, in this day and age, the majority of people don't have the attention span for 7 or 8 minutes of the same song, regardless of how good it may be, so I don't condone this decision because while the songs are shorter they still deliver. Many are going to accuse this as being Trivium's sellout album because, and let's be honest, this album definitely sounds more 'mainstream'. Take a song like 'In Waves' or 'Built To Fall' and you know what I mean. These tracks are more radio friendly and not the expected Trivium sound, although still really good tracks. However, one listen to a track such as 'A Skyline's Severance' would be enough to kill most pop radio junkies. So, while this track is definitely targeting a wider audience, Trivium have not sold out in any sense. Think of this as Trivium's 'Black album' (which is ironic seeing asalmost the entire album cover IS black).    Personally, I really enjoyed this album. I didn't particularly enjoy the pre-released tracks, except Dusk Dismantled and Built To Fall. However, almost every other song on the album is much better. In Waves and Inception of the End are definitely good tracks, but they lack somehow. Tracks like Caustic Are The Ties That Bind, Forsake Not The Dream, A Skyline's Severance, and Black are phenomenal. There's also a fantastic ballad-esque song called Of All These Yesterdays, which from my first listen I knew was going to upset the hardcore, moshing Trivium fans, but I'm a sucker for a well executed ballad and this track is VERY well executed. The chorus is the catchiest piece of music Trivium has ever made.    I only have two gripes with this album. My first, and largest, issue with this album is the lack of guitar work on this album. While there are still great solos and brilliant riffs, compared to Trivium's last three albums, the soloing in this album has been cut back dramatically. Solos on Shogun and The Crusade were lengthy and epic, while solos on this album are short, sweet, and to the point, but they're almost TOO short. Trivium did warn that they would be doing this on purpose but in my opinion they could have added more, such as Inception of the End for example. That track sounds like it's harboring a great guitar solo, but when the time comes, all you get are two measures of a simple lead track that consists of exactly 12 notes, which disappointed me. My second problem is the inconsistency of this album. While all the tracks are good and achieve what they're meant to individually, as a whole this album seems to be clashing with itself. It sounds like Trivium is torn between (scylla and charybdis *wink*) melody and ferocity. Some tracks are devastating and brutal and deliver greatly and others have great structure, but they don't impress as well and vice versa.    All in all, this album will please the current Triviumfan, but those still stuck in the days of Ascendancy, waiting for the band to \\"return to form\\" will have one more reason to scoff with this release. Compared to Shogun, the band's strongest effort in my opinion, this album is obviously not the follow-up I was hoping for, but it is NOT a letdown. This album showcases Trivium's more melodic songwriting ability and emphasizes Matt Heafy's vocal abilities, which are incredible on this offering. I enjoy this album a lot and while I would have liked to hear more of Matt and Corey going wild, I can't blame them for trying a different approach with their sound. This album is a great effort from a great band. This album isn't a letdown, it isn't a sellout album, and it's not mainstream. It's simply a talented band exploring their sound and capabilities. Take 'The Crusade' for example. I thoroughly enjoyed that album, but a lot of people bashed it. However, without it, Shogun never would have seen the light of day. The same may be true with this album. It may be a different approach to Trivium's style, but it's still fantastic and in time, this album may lead to another phenomenal album.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|This is by far the most complete mobile game I&apos;ve experienced. It has the feeling of the old super nintendo\/sega days when games were fun!

B004XQO90O|2.0|The Suspense aspect was the movie's best feature. The Right-To-Die Message and the slurs against the Defense Establishment were turn-offs. From here, I'm going to spoil a bit, so stop if you don't want to know.    The notion of being reincarnated as a public employee in Chicago as a sort of Liberal Nirvana would be parody in a saner world. Then again, if the world were sane, I wouldn't have seen this movie in the first place.
B000OPPBEQ|5.0|Great Movies. Great Blu-Ray's. Spectacular Entertainment. I got this set for $26 during a Gold Box Deal. Could it get any better than that? I doubt it. However this is something that even paying full price for, it's worth it. If you have a blu-ray player, this is a MUST OWN set to show off the clarity. Highly Recommended.

B003Y5H542|1.0|'Rango' just never gains traction, in spite of a few clever bits.  The humor is OK, but never hilarious.  It tries hard, but the story never becomes emotionally engaging.   Artistically it's a gray wall with the occasional piece of glitter stuck to it.    I'd give it two stars, but the glowing first review is clearly astroturfing, so here's a bit of balance.
B004EPYZOO|1.0|One Star is far too much for a film that singlehandedly disproves the theory of evolution(HINT: If you have opposable thumbs and you liked the movie, stop now). I liked movies like the Punisher and Jonah Hex, so I was willing to give this a chance. I expected SOOO much more from Nicolas Cage; this movie has conferred junk bond status on an once great actor.    In it's defense though, the creators of this seem to have sired a new genre: p0rn noir. There's an old maxim that comes to mind, and this piece of filth is no exception: Success has many fathers, but failure is a bast... err. misbegotten.     Save your precious time and money, unless you are skeet shooting or know of a landfill that's just begging to have indigestion.
B0052WKZZ6|3.0|Compared to the wonderful Deluxe versions of Tubular Bells, Hergest Ridge and Ommadawn, the Deluxe release of Incantations falls considerably short. Completely aside from the part four glitch, which has been promptly addressed by the record company and replacements will be sent when available, my disappointment is focused on the 5.1 dvd release. I was hoping and expecting the entire piece was going to be released in 5.1, and instead, all we are given are snippets. They all sound nice, but they are not the entire work. The new stereo versions sound fine, but they do not interest me as much as a surround version. Why release surround versions of the first three, but not this piece? To be clear, I enjoy everything presented here, but the release is incomplete without a 5.1 version of the entire recording, and as such, hardly qualifies as Deluxe.

B0041E7WHU|4.0|I had read this book years ago and remembered liking it so I picked it up again and realized that this much more a social commentary than an actual novel. This does not take away from the author's excellent writing--just be aware of the setting.  There are some fascinating moments where the narration reaches a peak in style and action--it's like getting in a time travel machine and seeing how people managed poverty in the last century--also the comparing of Paris and London is like entering two different temperature zones from one minute to the next--the effect is quite astonishing.  We also get to see another side of the author; if we think about his seminal novel 1984 or Burmese Days we do get a glimpse of his sensitivity to the plight of others and the social barriers encountered but here at the end of the book he changes mode and gets on his soapbox for a while to expound a bit on social injustices and the like--it's a bit of an anticlimax to the book esp. the Paris section which I greatly preferred to the London section--it had more passion and colour to it ; but then perhaps it is just a reflection of the cultural reactions to certain situations--even Orwell expressed a preference for Paris.  Well, it's not a long book so it's not too big of a commitment--I thought it had it's highlights and it's entertaining and interesting to go back to another time and another place for a while to ponder on the effects of poverty in a time gone by and since it's drawn from the personal experience of a real person as well as a famous author it lends an additional quality to the writing which you might enjoy.

B000002Q88|5.0|KANSAS' 1988 concept album has met with mixed reviews and disappointing sales.  But it's really one of the progressive rock band's best offerings.  Yes, Kerry Livgren is missed but his absence doesn't diminish the brilliance of this remarkable collection.<br />Steve Walsh's vocals are soaring and penetrating.  The musicianship Kansas has always excelled at is evident as well.<br />The majority of the songs are some of the band's best, regardless of who composed them.  While a concept project, the songs stand on their own merits.  My faves:  the powerful RAINMAKER---wow!; the euphoric anthem ONE BIG  SKY; ONE MAN ONE HEART's sweeping force; the beautiful poignancy of GHOSTS and the tragic BELLS OF SAINT JAMES.  Other than the classic DUST IN THE WIND, these are KANSAS' finest moments.<br />Some of rock's best bands have survived major personnel shake-ups and refocused to maintain their musical integrity---KANSAS is one of them.  IN THE SPIRIT is a worthy companion to KANSAS' classic repertoire.
B00005Q3TZ|5.0|Excellent, realistic account of the bombing of Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941 that propelled the United States into World War II.

Terrific acting by a wonderful supporting cast.
B00003CXGG|4.0|Jet Li never achieved Jackie Chan's level of commercial fame in the United States, but he has the honor of having helped create some notable cult action classics; and I know for sure that \\"Romeo Must Die\\" is a cult classic because I rented it about a million times after it was released. An ambitious modern evolution of the urban/kung fu meldings from Bruce Lee's heyday, \\"Romeo\\" is a competent martial arts vehicle and a surprisingly entertaining blend of action-comedy and crime picture, not to mention a satisfying solo vehicle for Jet Li and a promising big screen debut for the late Aaliyah. Director Andrzej Bartkowiak has yet to outdo himself.<br /><br />The story: as tensions between competing African-American and Asian underground syndicates reach a breaking point, a young martial artist (Li, [[ASIN:B00030590I Hero]]) escapes from prison to redeem his brother's death - a quest for which he will be joined by the daughter of an ex-crime lord (Aaliyah, [[ASIN:B000069I1I Queen of the Damned]]).<br /><br />Part of this movie's selling point - both in advertising and pre-production - was that it was a hip-hop version of Shakespeare's play of a similar title, but that's largely a bunch of nonsense: any similarities between the two are vague, and were it not for the title, few would have spotted them. Nevertheless, I did appreciate the amazingly chaste romantic rendition between the Li and Aaliyah: it's classy and pulled off pretty well considering the latter had never acted before and the former was speaking English for the first time. The rest of the story - penned by Mitchell Kapner ([[ASIN:0790750422 The Whole Nine Yards]]) - is also pretty good; surprisingly intelligent, with a good twist at the end, and considering the antics of the future lookalike vehicles Bartkowiak directed ([[ASIN:B00009Q98I nuclear diamonds]], anyone?), it's also fairly realistic and relevant in regards to interracial relationships. Considering the type of movie, I'm amazed at how well-acted it was, even without Delroy Lindo ([[ASIN:B00003CWNR The Cider House Rules]]) adding his theatrical clout to the cast.<br /><br />Of course, realism takes a nosedive during the five or six hand-to-hand fights, which were choreographed during that period following [[ASIN:B000P0J0AQ The Matrix]] when every action director was trying to emulate Yuen Woo-Ping. Corey Yuen's one of my favorite fight wranglers of all time, but he deviates from his usual style a bit by rewriting the laws of physics 100% to make Jet stay in the air long enough to complete complex kicking combinations. Sometimes I like the fight scenes a lot, sometimes I'm bored with 'em, but on any day, I'm glad that villain Russell Wong gets to show off his moves during the finale with Jet; their fight wasn't the greatest, but after busting his butt throughout the still-unreleased \\"Vanishing Son\\" franchise, he deserved a solid mainstream platform like this to show off. There's also a pretty creative fight with Francoise Yip ([[ASIN:0780619331 Rumble in the Bronx]]) in here, following a motorcycle chase scene that was later plagiarized by John Woo in [[ASIN:B00003CXDG Mission - Impossible II]].<br /><br />Much like the director, Jet Li rarely topped himself as far as his career in America is concerned. With this film, he established himself as less of a comedian than Jackie Chan and more or a martial artist, and would go on to collect a loyal but relatively limited fanbase with this image. Future vehicles would show off his dramatic and charisma-related deficiencies, but in \\"Romeo\\", these are dutifully covered by both the smart script and the other performers. It's the Jet Li vehicle for the most general action fan, I think, and I can't think of too many folks who'd be genuinely disappointed in it.

0765326353|5.0|I've read the wheel of time series (at least what's been published). Why didn't I learn my lesson. To be sucked into a series so mind blowing just to have to wait more than 20 years for the series to be completed is excruciating. I read the synopsis of the book, I knew that Brandon Sanderson called this the beginning of an epic fantasy series but I just couldn't help it. I love everything that Sanderson writes. Yes, even the Alcatraz books.     The story is wonderful. The universe Sanderson creates is as complex as it is beautiful. The circle of Kal's journey from a promising youth destined to be a brilliant surgeon to save lives, to a soldier taking them, to a slave in the position once again to save lives is brilliant! His struggle to learn some of the wonderful powers that he's been given juxtaposes nicely with the demonstrations of what a true master can acheive in the assassin. The other \\"main\\" characters of Shallan and Dalinar are captivating if not as fulfilling as that of Kal's. Dalinar's striving to follow the precepts of the book \\"the Way of Kings\\" while being subjected to brutally painful history lessons is a brilliant vehicle for showing us the history of the Stormlight universe. Shallan's dabbles into changing a things nature gives a brief look into only one of the magic systems Sanderson has created.     Unfortunately, I can't wait for the next books to be published. Its been almost a year or more since \\"The Way of Kings\\" has been published and there is not even light in the horizon signaling the dawn of a new book yet.    At least, he's working on a \\"Memory of Light\\" now. Maybe he can get that punched out so he can concentrate on the stormlight universe again.

B001FB55I0|4.0|After Terminator 3 a lot of people probably figured the series was over. Arnold was gone, Judgment day happened, what else was left? Terminator Salvation takes on the next logical subject, the war of the future. Salvation's apocalyptic showdown is a bit more tame than the one Cameron originally gave us- unstead of a hellish, black warzone roamed by uncountable armies of terminators, Salvation takes the life after people route as human stragglers hide from roving killer robots in the abandoned derelicts of civilization. The film follows a crew of heroes who come together to battle Skynet, culminating in more of the industrial-warhammer-hell you might have expected.    Perhaps one of the biggest stars of Salvation is the special effects work. As much as possible this film uses model work and animatronics SUPPLIMENTED by CG, and it shows. The corny CG of 3 is gone, replaced by believable, gritty mechanized mayhem. This realism cost the film dearly, giving a budget it couldn't really hope to recoup, but it's worth it as an example of what you can do if you don't just rely on computers.    The BD looks and sounds fantastic. Unlike the overproduce T3, Salvation has grain in the night shots, tons of detail, and all sorts of rugged post-apocalyptic dirt on actors faces (except the pristine and, in this version, slightly more nude Moon Bloodgood). The terminators in particular look genuinely awesome, although they don't quite achieve the jerky nightmarish appeal of the stop-motion original. Like T3 this movie ONLY has a pop-up menu. There's a good variety of special features and additional footage- some of the restored content, primarily the expansion of some of Marcus' scenes, is a welcome addition to the film, while other bits, such as the aforementioned almost-nudity, seem poorly edited in.    Overall, this is a worthwhile buy for series fans and hi-def aficionados, although the slow, moody pace and dependance on past material may put off people new to the series. So if you haven't seen any Terminator films and you're looking at this... Buy all 4. They're cheap now.
B0055B0MIO|3.0|Trivium is still having trouble creating an album that every single song is a keeper. Not that these songs are throwaways, some start strong and finish strong but the middle is a bit lack luster or the beginning and end isn't as great as the middle is. Point is they still haven't mastered the art of consistency in their writing like some of their heros have done.    This is one of those albums that I have to give a few listens to see if it's something that'll grow on me which I find to be a shame since these katz are extremely talented. The dramatic leaps forward from 'Ascendancy' to 'The Crusade' and the massive jump from 'The Crusade' to 'Shogun', you'd expect another leap forward with this release but it seems to me they are stuck in the same gear or starting to drift backwards.     Heafy still has trouble figuring out when to scream or when to sing and sometimes it feels very out of place when he figures wrong.      All of the good riffs on this album have a Sepultura feel to them which is ironic since this is released w/ a Sepultura cover. This actually could have been better and not as good as I expected from them.
B004Y1WCDE|2.0|Install of server went well.   Could index my media files.   Some would play.  Then suddenly the server began serving slowly.  Then not at all.   The next time i had issues a few videos played then slow then it dumps me back to the video select screen.   Reindexing solved the issue once.   Music seems to play no matter what.   Probably because they are all pretty much the same file type.  Aka. Mp3.   \n\nThere are also tons of issues with performance and the fact that overall it is messy.   It constantly looses connection to the server and gives obscure error messages.  \n\nWorst is that it is not in the android market and hence updates are far and few inbetween.   This has a lot of applications, but few will be seen.
B003VANOFY|5.0|PROS: These are rugged - quality construction.  In the last year I've been through several pairs of less expensive headphones that were cheap plastic.  But I've had these a couple of months and nothing is loose, nothing is bent.  The sound is *amazing*, especially with the surround.  They sound so real I find myself taking them off sometimes when I turn it up loud, thinking that my my real speakers are on and the neighbors will complain.  But nope, it just sounds that realistic.  The little \\"roller\\" volume control is a VERY good touch - someone hit a home run with that.  Allows you to adjust the volume much more quickly than two push buttons.<br /><br />CONS:<br />I have only a few small issues with this headset - other than these, it is almost perfect:<br /><br />1. To turn the headset off/on, you're supposed to hold down the power button. Problem is, there is no feedback (either visual or audible) to know how long to hold the button down - and the length of time seems to vary based on whether the set is plugged in or not, or just if the headset is having a bad day or something.  The LEDs flash when turning the set on/off, but only AFTER you let up on the button.<br /><br />2.  Sometimes if I power the unit on with the transmitter already plugged in, the software doesn't connect to it correctly.  The result is that the roller volume control doesn't change the volume.  So you can still hear, you just can't turn it down if its too loud.  You have to unplug and plug in the transmitter.  So don't plug it into the back of the case in an inaccessible place - you'll be unplugging/plugging it in often.<br /><br />3. The software for using the G buttons was designed to send specific keystrokes to specific programs.  And I guess that's okay if you're using it only for games and media players.  But it means that you can't send generic keystrokes to the entire system (such as just simulating the spacebar, to start/stop the Netflix or Hulu video players).  But, I did just finda developer's kit on the Logitech site, and being a developer, that problem may be solved soon.  :)<br /><br />Other than that, I LOVE this headset.<br /><br />UPDATE: It's been over a year since I bought them, and they're still working.  I use them 8-10 hours a day, about 6 days a week.  There are some wear issues, so I've ordered another pair and will use these as a backup:  1. The outer layer of material on the ear cups have worn away.  But the padding is still good. I think I could get another 6+ months out of the padding. 2. The battery has lost some capacity over time.  It lasted 10 hours when I got them, but now lasts only about 8 hours. That's the reason I'm getting another pair, so I never have to have them plugged in while wearing them.
1451629184|3.0|\\"A Stolen Life\\" by Jaycee Dugard is one of the most wrenching accounts I've ever read. All through the book I simply wanted to throw back my head and howl to the heavens--how is it that the police department of California took so little interest in the activities of a known sex offender? How can that psychiatrist have given him such a glowing evaluation?  How, why, why?    Dugard writes as dispassionately as possible in the circumstances. The fiend who did those things to her is a monster of depravity. Why are men--most sex offenders are men--allowed to get away with this?    I hope writing this account was cathartic for Dugard, and I devoutly hope she lives happily ever after. She certainly deserves to do so.

B003C0IGRE|5.0|Finished this book in 3 days. It is an international espionage fun ride that is both realistic and still contemporary in 2011. I have to give this book 5 stars and hope one day to see it made into a movie.
0553801473|5.0|For some reason, I though this would be the last installment in the series.  As I neared the end and saw no possible way that was going to happen, I read (duh!) how more was to come.  Who wants this to end, anyway?  The plot lines and numerous names are easy to forget and confuse but a whole world is being created here.<br /><br />I couldn't get through any of Tolkien's work but George R.R. Martin is much more readible for me. It can get tedious at times but this is usually a set-up for what is to come.  These passages may actually be planned like this.<br /><br />Overall, I continued to enjoy the many twists and turns and the death of a major \\"player\\" certainly surprised me and I'm sure the next installment will end up in my hands...but NOT quickly enough!<br /><br />We all waited a long time for this book and I don't like the idea of waiting several years to read the next. It was too painful for me and perhaps to other readers, as well.<br /><br />Before I knew who the author was, he walked passed me at the fantasy fair in The Netherlands.  I had only begun reading his first book.  Had I known who he was and what I would soon be reading, I most certainly would have thanked him for his work!  I believe this book series and this author are among the best of this century!
B004K4AVAG|1.0|Lady Gaga is trying too hard. This whole rebellion thing she has going on, it's too much. And a revolutionary anthem of self-love and world peace, based on God? It's a little incredulous. No good comes from Religion, Lady Gaga. Just war, hatred, bigotry and recism. Try again.
B000O5AYCA|5.0|This album is awesome. If I left you with that it would be enough. This band has such a cool sound. There is almost complexity found in the simplicity of it. I don't know that I can explain that statement fully, but either way I would highly suggest this album along with the album High Violet. Do yourself a favor and get both. YOU WILL NOT BE DISSAPPOINTED. This album along with High Violet is like eating fluffy pancakes with the warmest, richest maple syrup running down your throat.

B004MC8CA2|5.0|I couldn&apos;t love this app more. It makes carrying my Bible with me everywhere so easy. I love having access to just about any translation ever created. (Bibles are expensive, and now I don&apos;t have to drop $60 a pop just to have a new translation.) I love the reading plans. I&apos;m currently reading the chronological plan, and I can&apos;t tell you what a difference it has made in my comprehension to be reading the chapters in the order they were (probably) originally written. I also love that I can listen to some versions, since it sometimes makes the more difficult passages easier to understand. I seriously LOVE this app. And to those who question the permissions, internet access is needed to access versions that aren&apos;t downloaded to the phone. Also, you create an account with YouVersion so they can help you track your progress and reading goals, and so you can do things like post key and meaningful verses on Facebook if you want. I&apos;ve never been spammed by the developers.

B000002UY3|5.0|I can never say enough good things about Mazzy Star.  It seems like everything they do never fails.  \\"She Hangs Brightly\\" is no exception.  I just love the far away, trippy vocals that seem different from anyone else.  The song writing has thought behind it which makes the music more than just a beat.  Those beats too happen to be fantastic.  Some of my favorites on this album are the starting number \\"Halah\\", \\"Give You My Lovin'\\" and \\"Ghost Highway\\" (which I think I first heard on the soundtrack for Love and a .45).  The girlish, breathy, gothic, swampy singing is something you get pulled into like a trance.  I can listen to this album and forget what's going on around me, and I have.  The vocals kind of remind me of Stevie Nicks mixed in with Marianne Faithfull in the 60's and The Doors if they had a female singer.  A great note for Mazzy Star is that I love the entire cd - nothing makes me want to fast forward and generally I'm going back to hear things again.  I think of this as great road music or driving music.  It seems many of the themes blend into that.  \\"She Hangs Brightly\\" is a far cry from that horrible pop junk that they try to call music nowadays.  When Mazzy Star first came out I don't remember them being hugely popular on a mainstream level, but everyone I knew who really loves music loves Mazzy Star.  I'm glad though that they didn't explode like that.  Just another thing that makes them special.  Whether you decide to buy this, or any of the Mazzy Star albums, you won't be dissapointed.  This is a band like no other.

He majored on minor characters and did not develope them, nor did he tie up any loose ends for the characters we know. He also graduated to the vilest of language and assaulted us with it constantly.  A terrific let down.

B00518HBD0|4.0|Apparently some of these reviews are from people who enjoy the 3DD sound of there last three albums, cookie cutter ballads that all sound the same.  Away From the Sun had some songs that actually rocked, but this is the first album since the Better Life that actually ROCKS!.  I tried listening to 17 days, but when every song sounds the same, it seems like they were selling to a specific audience, not doing what they do so well, as they did on the better life.  This album is quite refreshing, upbeat rock music, some actually hard edged, that puts 3DD back in my CD changer rotation.

0385341679|5.0|Hot Damn!!! This is one bad ass ride of a read.  You want to read all 5 books.  It is a journey that has you on the edge of your seat the entire series.  It has it all; a young women coming into her own several hot men that are main characters.  A nitty gritty get down and dirty story.  It brings all the first four books together.  Mackayla comes a long way from when she first sets foot in Dublin.  Dang, you can't wait to see how this soft and fluffy gal turns in the hard core heroine in the end.  She goes through some horrible things but in the end she is stronger and wiser.  This story is riveting, sexy, and it has you whooping hollering and then sad and blue. Then right back up again...  It's not your usual romance.  If you can even call it that.  Read it.  You won't be disappointed.

B004EPYZU8|4.0|This film is an amazing cross between reality and fantasy.  The use of graphic arts enhances this. The overall theme is dark but the story line features hope.  It has a kind of \\"Do not go quietly into the night\\" theme as the young women attempt to overcome their fate. The action sequences are really good. My only disappointment was that while much of the story is centered on the young girls dancing, we never get to see any of her dancing. Liked this one a lot.
B002ZG99QS|5.0|TRON: LEGACY is a bit like Inception without the hard bits. We have multiple layers of meaning, doors of perception banging in the digital breeze, philosophical explorations of the outermost limits of inner space, but all of that is regularly put aside for wild rides on very fast motorcycles - or what the movie calls ''lightcycles''. It's a bit like Fast and Furious, directed by Stanley Kubrick on holiday.<br />The Movie was great to watch and the story line was solid from  beginning to end for the movie.<br />Trong Legacy is an incredible feat. Everything from the visual effects to the Daft Punk scored soundtrack and plot is amazing. I'm sure the movie will be very polarising but so was 2001 A Space Odyssey and Blade Runner when they were released. I do rate Tron Legacy among those movies when it comes to innovative visual breakthroughs.
0553801473|2.0|Let me preface this review by stating I absolutely love the first 3 books. I couldn't get enough of AGOT when I read it for the first time in 1999 and I quickly finished up ACOK followed by ASOS when it was published in 2000. All three took me on a wonderful journey to a fantastic land filled with fully realized characters and their rich interwoven histories. What an utter joy those books were.<br /><br />The same previous adolations can't be said for GRRM's last 2 books (AFFC and this one) as they have completely failed to live up to established standard. My biggest complaint with  both AFFC and ADWD is that the plot stagnates. At first I really thought that AFFC was just a result of the misfire with the proposed five year gap....and I granted ADWD the same leeway until it caught up to AFFC....but after the \\"catch up\\"....a whole lot of nothing continued to happen. I'm all for immersive storytelling and to accomplish that you need details to the world that make it all feel alive, however, GRRM goes way overboard in ADWD. This book felt more like a travelogue wherein you just followed random characters as they traveled from point A to point B. During the course of the travel you were treated to endless descriptions of every medieval food imaginable (and when that got stale...well hope you like turtles).<br /><br />Anyways had AFFC and ADWD been condensed into one book then it probably would have been pretty good. Of course that assumes GRRM's editor would actually do his/her job (which judging from ADWD it appears that GRRM is considered untouchable in his editor's eyes).<br /><br />Also the abrupt changes in personality for some major characters is jarring and really put me off of their respective stories. At this point I hope Drogon just eats Dany so I don't have to read her inane internal dialogue about her latest school girl crush and what she wants to do to him.<br /><br />GRRM also constantly repeats dialogue; I get what he is trying to do but most of the timeit just gets annoying. His treatment of greyscale also comes out of left field. These are two small points to quibble about but they highlight a larger issue for me: it appears that GRRM just kind of writes by the seat of his pants without a broader outline to guide him which worries me considering ASOIAF's multiple plotlines that intersect to a certain degree. I wonder if he has lost control of his narrative and/or knows how to truly wrap this up in the next 2 books.<br /><br />I don't know when the next book will be published (according to GRRM he won't be starting on it until the early part of 2012.....so best guess is 2017 but probably later as at least ADWD was half written in 2005). I do know I won't be buying it new as I suspect that GRRM will likely think that the fact that ADWD is a best seller as proof that the book is actually really good. And honestly at this point I'm bored with the narrative and will wait to pick up the final books if and when they are published. Hopefully GRRM finds the book 1-3 magic because at times ADWD harkened back for me (the Davos and Selmy chapters reminded me of his previous efforts) but if I have to treat this series as ending after ASOS so be it.<br /><br />Fingers crossed for Darkstar POVs because I for one will relish reading the line \\".....and I am of the night\\" over and over and over again!
140120841X|3.0|If \\"Batman's\\" Joker were ever to make a film expressing his view of the world, it would like very much like \\"V for Vendetta.\\" The main character, who goes by the name of \\"V,\\" is the anti-Batman. He is the way the Joker must see himself; a hero in his own eyes, flattering himself as an accomplished man, in a justified struggle against orderly society. Of course, he has such a poisoned heart that he imagines the worst of that orderly society. This movie is a brilliant demonstration of the criminal mind of a comic book character. Judging by the recent riots across Britain in real life, obviously V (or the Joker) would find plenty of fellows, happy to blow up Parliament--or anything else in their paths. This movie is a celebration of nihilism, candy-wrapped for today's slacker youth.     For a movie of this sort to merit 5-stars, it needs to go beyond the comic book world. Nothing in this movie is realistic. It's all self-indulgent, 2-dimensional, over-the-top shenanigans. Even the motives of V are only vaguely explained, as if the persistent demonization of authority were sufficient for us to understand the anti-hero.     The graphics are good, the editing is fine. The technicals of the movie are no better nor worse than any of the so-called \\"graphic novels\\" that are popular today. It is escapist fantasy for people who want to think childish thoughts about the world.

034552554X|4.0|Before she is emancipated at eighteen years old, Victoria Jones has lived in 32 different foster homes creating havoc wherever she's lived.  Abandoned at birth by a mother she never knew and knows nothing about, the only steady contact she's had in her life is Meredith, her social worker.  Meredith's role is primarily to take Victoria from one foster home and place her in another.<br /><br />The novel goes back and forth in time, exploring Victoria's childhood years and comparing them with her current life.  The reader learns of the one real and significant relationship that Victoria had as a child - her relationship with Elizabeth who wanted to adopt her when she was ten.  It is through Elizabeth that Victoria learns the Elizabethan language of flowers, each flower signifying an emotion or feeling.  Victoria's time with Elizabeth started out very rocky and during the sixteen months she spent there, she grew to love Elizabeth.  A tragedy prevents the adoption from taking place.<br /><br />Once emancipated from her final group home at eighteen years old, Victoria has no place to live.  She makes herself a shelter in Delores Park in San Francisco.  There she plants a garden with flowers that she tends with love.  She observes a florist, Renata, who own a store called `Blooms' and approaches her with a request for work.  At first, Victoria works one day a week helping Renata at the wholesale flower market on Sundays.  Her work time increases and she is able to rent a very small apartment on the money she earns.<br /><br />At the flower market, Victoria meets a man who she is attracted to.  This is a miracle for her as she hates to be touched - physically or psychically.  This man, Grant, corresponds with her by the language of flowers, sending her notes that have particular meaning in the floral tongue.  Victoria responds to this but is terrified of intimacy or attachment of any type.<br /><br />Her knowledge of flowers and their meanings is so complete that Renata's customers go to Victoria and ask her to make special bouquets for goals in their lives - pure love (dianthus), purity of heart (water lily), warmth of feeling (peppermint), and courage (protea).  These are just a few of the dreams, hopes, and aspirations that Victoria's clients ask her to share with them in her flower arrangements.  Renata, as Victoria's mentor, watches happily as Victoria begins to come into herself.<br /><br />I found myself smelling the flowers as I read the book.  It was like an experience in synesthesia.  Sometimes I smelled roses, then peppermint, then cherry blossoms.  I was mesmerized by the book and the flower metaphors that prevailed.  I loved the way The Language of Flowers showed how Victoria was able to escape her locked in world of fear, to reach out in a way that only someone else well-versed in her floral knowledge could respond to.  When Grant and Victoria start a correspondence with flowers, the reader can't help but root for them to overcome all the many obstacles in their paths.<br /><br />This is a book filled with pain and anguish, ameliorated to some extent by the beauty of floral language that the protagonist is well-versed in.  Without this language, she would be alone, cut off from everyone and without a way to communicate.  It's her own personal way of signing as she is deaf to the true meaning of the spoken word.  Her life of group home after group home has dulled her senses, scared her out of trying intimacy and prevented her from normal attachment.<br /><br />Victoria is a lonely soul whose growth and connections are beautifully portrayed in this book.  This is a debut novel by the author, Vanessa Diffenbaugh, who attributes her inspiration for writing it in part from her experience as a foster mother.  Diffenbaugh has a natural affinity for words and I hope that this is the beginning of a long and fruitful writing career.her to make special bouquets for goals in their lives - pure love (dianthus), purity of heart (water lily), warmth of feeling (peppermint), and courage (protea).

B004SGWYW4|3.0|I watched HOTD in Japanese- so I can't speak for the dub, since I actually didn't by the DVD yet. This is a short series, and they oddly enough stamped it forty dollars? No way. The show is entertaining to watch on a rainy day, if you don't have anything better to watch. But, to spend that much on 12 episodes of a show with virtually NO story whatsoever and nothing but fanservice is like paying for a prostitute to stare at.<br /><br />Cliches out the ass. Every character has huge breasts and a butt that could be considered a rear bust. We get every sort of overused carbon copy stereotype that we can. Moe, super moe, super tsundere, loli, fat nerd otaku, the overly regular guy who turns out to be a badass, military chick and so on. It's nothing to write home about. The animation is decent, but it seems they put the most budget and effort into shading the female assets when they're constantly jamming them down your throat. Call me gay for saying there's too much fanservice... but there really is.<br /><br />I can't bash it for not having a story, since it's a zombie plot. Government shadiness, people dying, moral crisis, loss of innocence, it's all rather typical. So they don't gain points but they don't lose many either. Though you can call them unoriginal and dock points if you're critical like me.<br /><br />There's a carefree negligence the show makes blatantly obvious almost every scene. They all know that they could easily die and be doomed at any moment, but... nobody seems to care. I understand losing the will to live during the apocalypse, but they just blindly run into hordes of zombies like \\"LOLOL I HOPE I DUN GET BIT! DERP! CLOSE RANGE IS SMART WITH FLESH EATING INFECTED!\\" and it sort of pisses me off. Sure- it makes things 'fun' but at the same time makes it just lack just a bit more logic (though I know mentioning logic in a series about zombies is retarded).<br /><br />So- overall... if you want a new reason to look up images of certain characters and desire a blond haired nurse character who has breasts that might hit the floor if she were topless, look up High School of the Dead. It's not an amazing series, but there's a bit of fun bloodbrawling that makes you smirk and some nice bums and bewbs forced into every other scene. It's amazingly overpriced and I can only imagine that all the females have the most disgusting dubs ever- but give it a shot if you need something to keep you awake for a few hours.racter who has breasts that might hit the floor if she were topless, look up High School of the Dead.

He wrote the \\"to be continued\\" on the last page of book four dated 2005 [6 YEARS AGO]!!! He didn't even have the foresight or simple courtesy to settle even one of the many subplots. By the time the final books will be available, it will be a rare person who will remember enough to truly enjoy the final books.  That is unacceptable. I can't judge the series until I've read them all therefore he gets one star for this waste of time and I might upgrade it in twelve years. Good writer - very bad person.

With that said, she doesn't go into incredibly personal details, which I was glad for since I feel she deserves her privacy. This is a very inspiring story of such a brave, strong person. We can all learn from her courage.

0449227545|3.0|I didn't purchase this book, and I don't remember how I obtained it. Perhaps it was a gift from my deceased former wife. I didn't intend to read it. It was simply the only one I could reach on my \\"to-be-read\\" bookshelf. And I certainly wasn't interested in the premise - an aging hippy so mad at a threat to his world that he was wanting to make his own threat to the rest of the world. His threat was to produce earthquakes in California on demand (his).<br /><br />I am still not interested in the premise, or the characters. But, oh my, can that Ken Follett tell a story!<br /><br />He pulls interest from your conscious being. He does that, at least to me with this book, by explaining a method by which earthquakes might be initiated along the San Andreas Fault, by three-times creating drama around whether or not that method will actually work, by showing (believe it or not) that mass murderers have their \\"softer side,\\" by showing the stupidity of government administrators refusing to recognize potential tragedy when it's bearing down toward them, by putting his characters in jeopardy and then removing them from it (often by implausible means), and by starting a romance among two of the characters.<br /><br />Most especially, author Follett enhances the pace of his book by making it about interactions between the characters, only somewhat about introspection by his characters, and barely about descriptions of scenes or situations.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong, there is no character development, there little emotion shown by the characters (certainly true of the protagonist), and the plot won't confound or surprise you.<br /><br />It's an easy read, and I suppose that I am glad that I did. Author Follett refreshes the learning that one shouldn't tell a book by its cover - especially when it was written by a proven storyteller.<br /><br />Three stars for a good fast read, without being literature!

Most songs on the album are upbeat and fun, however there are a couple of ballads. Heaven and Earth on the deluxe edition is absolutely beautiful. The album is a great listen. Support Kelly. Go get the CD.
B000PWIF4G|5.0|The prose is haunting and poetic, and I wanted to start reading again immediately after finishing it.  Roy effectively used repetition of words, phrases and scenes.  The characters were so believable and some of them so sympathetic that I had to force myself to read the scene where Velutha is arrested.   One disturbing aspect of the story was a bit much to handle, but made sense with the theme of 'who you can love. and how. and how much.'
1416562605|3.0|\\"The White Tiger\\" is a rags-to-riches story with a difference. It doesn't quite fit into the usual bildungsroman structure that most narratives of this nature take on.     There is harsh learning, yes, but the protagonist Munna, or Balram (as his master christens him) kills a man, in order to become one; which turns the idea of finding one's humanity on its head, in a violent and cruel way.    Balram is not a typical hero, and he reveals himself to be both egotistical and amoral, but the reader finds it hard to judge him when the circumstances surrounding his downfall / rise out of the ashes of poverty (both applicable depending how you look at it) seem to suggest an unfortunate trajectory that leads him to what he eventually becomes.    Arqvind Adiga, the author, also experiments with the narrative, by having the story take on an epistolary form - most incredibly - as a series of letters from Balram, self-described as a thinking man and an entrepreneur, to Wen Jiabao (yes, the Chinese Premier).     But underlying this seemingly comically megalomaniac premise, the reader gets a sense of how lonely and isolated Balram really is in his guilt, as he tries to justify his path to \\"success\\" to someone as distant and important as Wen.     The streets of India, especially that of New Delhi, where \\"country mouse-turned-city chauffeur\\" Balram finds himself in, comes alive in all its colors and sounds, as the reader eavesdrop with Balram the conversations of his masters as well as those of fellow drivers.    Moving and unsettlingly endearing.

B0014NDXGA|4.0|The first rangefinder I received after about 3 times using it, developed a red splotch inside the viewing area. Might of been a drop of oil. Not sure what caused the problem. I called Bushnell costumer service and they had no idea what could cause that to happen. If I wanted to pay $10 I could ship it to them. Instead I talked to Amazon customer service and they were great (or at least I thought so at first). They shipped me another rangefinder with instructions on how to ship the defective one back, all at no additional charge to me. The only problem is the second one shipped to me was a factory rebuilt. While this one works fine and I really like the rangefinder, I was disappointed to get a factory rebuilt since originally I had paid for a brand new rangefinder. Not sure whether to be upset though, since the rebuilt one works okay. It will be interesting to see if Amazon responds to this review. One positive is that it is really easy to return a defective product with Amazon. There system of having you type in a phone number (on line) to call you, works extremely well. My only complaint is they didn't tell me they were going to replace my defective rangefinder with a rebuilt one. So rather than five stars I have to give it only four. I would be interested in some comments on my complaint.
B0050PYNO4|5.0|I absolutely loved this movie and I haven't been seeing much that I would buy on Blu-Ray in the last few years from Hollywood.  The writing is top notch and hilarious but that's only if you get the snark and the pop culture references.<br /><br />My brother and I were laughing through the entire film but I noticed many other people were not.  This film was written for the geeky sci fi fans in all of us, but you would need to have seen many other \\"geeky movies\\" to truly appreciate this film. If you are familiar with or part of the sci fi geek culture, then you will probably love this movie.  If you are looking into that culture from the outside, then you might not understand all the nods to other films and geek culture that make it so funny.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|Beautiful. A must-read for anyone who has lost a loved one...pet or person. Guess what? When your pet seems to understand you..know that he does. Love is alive in this story. There is hope for us all...dog and human. It's okay...you can read it.
B004FOA84A|3.0|This game can be beaten in a half hour or less. You could probably complete a speed run in about 5 or 6 minutes.    A couple of the hints and puzzles are somewhat obscure, but for the most part the game shouldn't pose much difficulty. Would earn a higher rating if it was longer.
0345529057|4.0|I was mightily irritated to realize, at the end of Book 4, that in fact only half of that tale is included in the set.  Martin allows as how the other half is in his upcoming book, Book 5.  It had the feel of bait and switch to me, and would suggest no longer selling the four as a set.
0470876417|5.0|I am an entrepreneur in Asia, although many books have been covering business concepts and models, however, this book's setting can teach the readers how to implement those concept in a practical way. I like the systematic approach this book used.    I recommend this book.

B000UYX4OK|3.0|This was a decent watch, I am a complete fan of 300 and G. Butler. However, this film does not have all of the effects that 300 has. The story is as cool as the animated version of Beowulf, it's a poem after all, and the scenery is breathtaking. Moreover, there are parts in this movie that will make you laugh, I thought the miniature horses they rode throughout were hilarious. Overall, I enjoyed the movie, and would recommend it for true movie watchers.
B005GHN2GG|4.0|Read this story back in 2009 on Fictionwise and bought it there. It put Grace Draven on my auto-buy list.     Silhara and Martise are brilliant together and I enjoyed every moment of their story. I have to admit to having a bit of a thing for the dark, tortured, snarky and just a bit evil hero and Silhara really was all that and more. Martise was a good match for him, which just made it better.     Loved it and might consider buying the kindle version again for the lovely cover and to see if this new release has any changes made to it.
B0049OSQ18|5.0|Holy cow, have I been living under a rock?  In my somewhat recent delving into alt-country I have no idea how I have missed this group.  They hit me spot on and I new it from the first song on this Cd, which I don't even know what it was as the CD was on shuffle.  Its like putting the whole pack of Life Savers in your mouth at once and trying to determine what is your favorite color.  Jeez.  I don't know what to say more specifically than this FEELS right.    Bought this as a suggestion via Pandora and man, honestly one of the best purchases this year and my first foray into the Decemberists.  I had heard of them some time back, but for whatever reason thought they were some Jack White side project. Could I have been more wrong?    Second song out that played, I believe 'Calamity Song' had a distinct REM feel (which isn't a bad thing), and I look in the jacket to find that Peter Buck was playing 12-string.  Cool.  Then later I was absolutely floored by the the female backup vocal.  I look it up in the jacket.... Gillian Welch are you freaking crazy?  I thought I had stumbled upon a supergroup!  This is a fan freaking tastic album and to me one of the best ones I have bought in 2011.  I am happy, but a little saddened that this group has been out there for seemignly ever without me knowing it.  Seems like I have a lot of catching up to do.    If you are on the fence.      GO    BUY    THIS.
0316067598|3.0|Okay, I know I am late to the party.  A friend handed me this book a few days ago so I set aside \\"A World Undone\\" to read something that was much easier to digest.  I really don't get this book. I understand what the \\"Lone Survivor\\" is attempting to say but I don't think it is coming across in a manner that he desires.   First of all he glorifies himself WAAAYYY to much.  If I am a family member of one of his team that died I am totally pissed.   Secondly, how in the hell does his watch work after falling thousands of feet from a mountain on several occasions?  Wouldn't one think a SEAL would know not to use the \\"light\\" feature on the watch in a pitch black night?    This guy is too impressed with his own abilities...save your money.
B004XGN8W4|5.0|Any gamer worth his salt will tell you that there are plenty of people out there who've made cases like this themselves. It involved lots of electronic skills and almost always involves the console of choice being built into the case. You'd think a portable gaming case like this would be a no brainier, so it astonishes me why no one's made these commercially until now. It was a brilliant idea, and the G155 functions perfectly. Its light, sturdy, the screen and audio work fine, and the price (While being a little high) is pretty reasonable, considering you just buying a monitor (Which are usually always costly. The actual case itself is rather strong, and can take quite the knock. Your console should stay safe inside it, short of kicking it as hard as you can with steel tipped boots. There's plenty of room for the ventilation of the consoles too, so that awesome.    FOR ALL INTERNATIONAL BUYERS!!!!!    I live in Australia and one of my major concerns was if my PAL formatted console would display on a US screen (Most US monitors don't work for PAL region devices). Luckily, it does! I was a little paranoid at first, because nothing was coming up on the screen at first, but I didn't realize the cables weren't plugged in fully.    All in all, an awesome product, and it's gonna make visiting friends and family 1oo times more bearable.
B004478GN8|5.0|Not much to say, other than this set is a great starter set. It comes with a few mini-figs and is it is great to see something other than more stormtroopers. My kids love them because they are like stormtroopers with color. Great, quick buy.
1591844096|2.0|On the plane from Beijing to Amsterdam I read Linchpin by Seth Godin.<br /><br />OK, I tried reading it.<br /><br />I gave up after about 40 pages and 400 simplistic generalizations. I nearly choked on my salted almonds when reading that Adam Smith (The Wealth of Nations) and Karl Marx (Das Kapital) \\"said the same thing.\\" (Which is similar to the claim that both Barack Obama and Adolph Hitler had the same number of fingers.)<br /><br />What bothered me most about Seth Godin's book is the problem of the Single Strategy God. It is a literary style that many business books suffer from. (Though I'm afraid it's often me, the reader, who is doing the real suffering.) The authors write from a divine perspective, and their books claim that if you want to be successful your strategy should be to \\"be a linchpin\\" or \\"find a blue ocean\\" or \\"lead a tribe\\" or \\"move from good to great\\" or \\"be a purple cow\\".<br /><br />But it's all a load of purple crap.<br /><br />If the Single Strategy God really existed He would have created all species to mimic the survival strategy of Antarctic krill. It is (measured in terms of biomass) the most successful species on our planet.<br /><br />Side note: in Linchpin Seth Godin argues that workers should try and become indispensible by becoming super-specialists: different from other people, and the only ones who can do their jobs, because linchpins define and adapt jobs around themselves. He ignores that, in a complex system, generalization and specialization, scaling up and scaling out, are the effects of forces that keep adapting to each other in never-ending balancing feedback loops. If nearly everyone in an economy would follow Seth Godin's advice and focus on specialization, and being different, then the few who would focus on generalization, and creating copies, could make a huge amount of money.<br /><br />People love simplistic advice. It reduces their need to think for themselves. After all, it takes effort to understand that the world is far more complex than Seth Godin tries to make us believe. It takes brains to realize that ants, humans, and cyanobacteria are successful because their survival strategies differ from each other. Some species scale up, others scale out. Some are specialists, others are generalists. Some systems thrive in blue oceans, others in sandy deserts. Some people are great linchpins, others are superb army knives.<br /><br />Any strategy that leads to success is a fine strategy.<br /><br />Seth Godin's strategy is to pad his ideas with as many stories, examples, anecdotes, and platitudes as possible, until every single idea can be published as a separate hardcover book in 200 pages, double-spaced. This strategy works brilliantly. If your name is Seth Godin.<br /><br />But would it work if your name is Jurgen Appelo?<br /><br />I don't believe so.<br /><br />p.s. I just returned from China, where many companies make money being unremarkable and copying/producing whatever the US and Europe want to procure, at the cheapest possible rate. It's a country of 1.3 billion army knives, not linchpins. I've heard this has helped sustain the global economy. Not such a bad strategy, it seems.<br /><br />Originally published at NOOP.NLeve.

142311339X|5.0|I absolutely loved Riordan's series Percy Jackson and the Olympians so I was both excited and apprehensive when I saw The Lost Hero in the Kindle store. I was definitely going to be heartbroken if it didn't live up to my expectations, but I needn't have worried.     The only thing that left me dissatisfied was not learning more about the Roman demigods and their camp, which Riordan promises to let us in on in the next installment, The Son of Neptune.    This latest series is full of the brilliant character development, exciting action, and the fun of Camp Half-Blood that Riordan introduced us to previously in Percy Jackson and the Olympians, but brings a new group of demigods in for us to care about. Our beloved friends from the previous series are still present as minor characters, and a lot of what we loved about them can also be seen in the new cast of Jason, Piper, and Leo.    As much as I loved The Lost Hero, I'm anxiously awaiting The Sone of Neptune to find out what happened to Percy, Jason, and who these Roman demigods are and why they had to be separated from the Greek heroes so many of us have come to love.    Long story short: If you loved Percy Jackson and the Olympians, you'll want to see what happens in The Heroes of Olympus.
B004X8W4A4|5.0|Brilliant book. It's nice to see that ABC team have made these books to go with the TV series. Really enjoyed reading it.
0345495004|4.0|I wish I could give this book 3.5 stars, but I will be generous and round it up to four. Here's why:<br /><br />First of all, I didn't know anything about Frank Lloyd Wright's personal life until I read this novel, which is based on true events. From the very beginning, I was completely swept away by Frank's relationship with Mamah Cheney, the wife of one of Frank's clients. Both Frank and Mamah were trapped in loveless marriages, and they ultimately sacrificed everything in order to be together: leaving their spouses, their children, and their credibility (infidelity was a big social taboo back in the early 1900s). Although society pegged these two lovers as wicked adulterers, I was moved by their desire to share their lives together. They thrived off each other not just physically, but they had a deep intellectual connection that seemed to justify their choice to be together.<br /><br />However, about halfway through the book, I started to get annoyed with Mamah. She became so self-righteous and full of herself that I started hoping that Frank would tire of her and leave her. It was frustrating to watch her be so incredibly judgmental of everyone around her, when I felt that she never fully took full responsibility of her own actions and the implications they had on her family. It was supremely irritating.<br /><br />Then, the ending of the book caught me completely off guard. I did not see it coming at all, and it was shocking and incredibly sad. It made me stop feeling completely irritated with Mamah as I had through most of the book.<br /><br />I really enjoyed this novel. \\"Loving Frank\\" is very well-written, with many engaging characters and storylines. I find myself wanting to learn more about these people and plan on reading more books about their lives.

0312430000|5.0|Recently, I read Atul Gawande's third book, \\"The Checklist Manifesto,\\" and I was SO impressed with the book...the content and his wonderful writing style, that I devoured his other two books: \\"Complications,\\" (his first book while he was still a medical resident) and \\"Better: A surgeon's notes on performance.\\"<br /><br />I sent out an email to everyone I knew about his books and told them that every once in a while an author write something really IMPORTANT. I plan to read his ongoing column in the New Yorker and anything else he writes in the future. The pioneering research...and writing he does can help save the lives of MILLIONS of people. He is like the Salmon Khan (who is revolutionizing education) of medicine. I hope that soon Dr. Gawande will make a presentation to a TED conference. He so-o-o has ideas worth spreading (The TED talks' mantra).<br /><br />By the way, coincidentally, I just happened to read the book on and around July 7th, (2011)...the anniversary of my father's death...who died PREMATURELY...as a direct result of a doctor error. My father went to his doctor complaining of stomach problems, and because he was on heart medication for congestive heart problems, his doctor assumed that it was the medication that was upseting his stomach, so she sent him home with the equivalent of Mylanta (for stomach upset). However, shortly thereafter, he was rushed to the hospital with a perforated ulcer. The sad thing was that in his medical chart, it was documented (repeatedly) that he had had years of difficulties with ulcers. My thought is that his doctor did not take this into consideration...she missed this...and my father lost his life as a result.<br /><br />A loss of a family member is a huge loss with many long-term ramifications.<br /><br />Thank you Dr. Gawande for your great work as a doctor, researcher, journalist, author and as a doctor who works with the WHO (World Health Organization) in improving patient safety.

B004VMVTNU|5.0|I love this alarm clock. I've been using it for 6 months now, and it is by far the best alarm clock I've used. I love the \\"gradual wake\\" feature. I hate getting startled awake by alarms, and now I can set a song or alarm to gradually increase in volume to wake me up. You can set different alarm sounds for each alarm, too. There is also a \\"nap timer\\", which is perfect for those 30 minute catnaps you need to refresh yourself in the middle of the day.<br /><br />Get this one, you won't regret it!
B003YL4LYI|3.0|What I wanted from this book is to be thrown back into GRRM's world.  I got that.  So i'm not going to complain.  The story arc is going where I expected to, it just did so in a very odd way.  This book is a game of cyvasse.  Fleshing out strategies and getting players in their places.  And now, we hold our breath for another 6 years for the fun to start. Read the Tales of Dunk and Egg for some background on the greenseer and dragon eggs.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book is totally awesome. Though the first chapter drowns on a little bit, it definitely picks up your interest after a few pages. A lot of my friends read it and did book reports on it and they loved it. One boy I know was reading it in class all period one day and he very rarely reads!

This book was hard to read, but she lived it.  I like how she wrote it the way she speaks, which made it easy to read.  I hope one day, she is able to be as free as the rest of us in every way possible.  I read this book in a day, it was very difficult to put down.  I recommend it.

B003AO1SVS|5.0|I'd never heard of the Black Keys before.  Heard a song on a movie and I've been hooked on this album since.      1.  \\"Howlin' For You\\" is on one of the NHL hockey albums and reminds me of Gary Glitter's \\"Rock n Roll\\" (in a good way!).    2.  \\"She's Long Gone\\" is the song that got me hooked in the first place.    3.  The official video for \\"Tighten Up\\" is a really great watch and the song grows on you.    4.  \\"Everlasting Light\\" is probably my favorite tune on this whole album.    5.  \\"Too Afraid To Love You\\" is another really great song on this disc.  6.  \\"Next Girl\\" Really great song, Really Bad video.      The overall sound of this album is like a mix of (or tribute to) all your fav classic rock bands.  Mellow, blusey, relaxing wonderful tunes to enjoy over and over.  Great guitar, strong vocals and some solid drumming combines for a near perfect album.  Nice to see some good new music for a change.  Tired of the same old pop songs.  HIGH RECOMMEND.  ENJOY!
074322454X|5.0|I have previously watched the TV mini-series Band of Brothers but never got around to reading the book the series was based upon. I have finally read it and enjoyed it immensely.    The book gives details the series could not give (due to time constraints) but aside from that the series remained faithful to Ambrose's research.     The best part of the book was that it didn't read like a boring history book - it was vivid, attention grabbing and read as if the men of E Company themselves were sitting across from you retelling their heroic tale. I was able to read Band of Brothers cover to cover without struggling to get through it (and in my book if any historical book can be read in that manner then that is a great feat.)    I recommend this to anyone who loved the Band of Brothers mini-series but craves more detail.
0553801473|3.0|Ok, I plodded through the first series.  Yes, George, you are a very good writer.  No, George, you are not good at delivering a whole tale in timely fashion.  Throughout the first books (1-4) I kept waiting for something to happen relative to the overall plot.  Nope...and let me tell ya George (listening I am sure), the paint drying analogy is very apt.  Some very good characters...can't fault you on character development.  I am totally into your whole concept.  Problem is, you are way....too....slow George.  Get it going! I can't imagine HBO paying to develop your entire work.  Hopefully, they will condense the last three books into one series.<br /><br />So George, here is what I am going to do.  I am not going to watch the HBO series.  I will wait the years it requires for you to finish this tale and then wait a little longer until I see your titles languishing on the shelves of used book stores.  By then, we might both be dead.
B0053Q9DHW|2.0|I will not go as far to say I hated this adaption but I very much disliked it. (Which I don't say too often about movies). First off, I was confused the first 5 minutes of the movie because the opening scene is about the halfway point of the story. Then it goes into 'flashback' scenes as Jane is 'remembering' what happened. Second, the story line was very rushed, lots of information was skipped and many characters left out. Third, the acting was only so-so and lacked the emotions that the characters should posses. Overall, it was a weak interpretation of the book and I probably won't make the effort to watch this one again.
0553582038|5.0|After finishing book 3 I could not wait to order the next one. I got it right away it was small enough package to fit in my mailbox, but the last few novels of this series were square thick paperbacks dimensions maybe 4 by 8 or so. This book is wider, like 6 by 9, so its kind of floppy when trying to hold it upright and stuff. Not a big deal, just to point out. Other than that, I'm about midway through, some chapters are very interesting and other chapters go off into different story archs that I do not find interesting only distracting. The series is great, and definitely worth reading. I know there's a TV series but the depth and detail of a television show cannot compare to the book form.
030746363X|4.0|In the beginning of this book Tim clearly states that it is NOT intended to be read cover to cover.  Although some day I may.  He breaks down very early where to get what your looking for and so far I'm addicted.  The section on ice baths, definately not for me. The section(s) devoted to female for 15 minutes, definately for ME AND MY HUSBAND!  Things were good to start with, this is a nice addititive after a decade of marriage!  There seem to be many parts that are extreme in the book (i.e. the ice baths) but many, many simple things that have been easy to incorporate.   The book is definately written in a style in which Tim trys to be telling you from accross the table at a bar, coffee house, or anywhere easy conversation can take place.  It's nice that he has the 'geek' stuff highlighted to skip, but there if you care.  Reiderating from before, I haven't completed the book cover to cover but LOVE what I have found!  AND hoping to become superhuman;)
B0052VUNHC|3.0|Despite the truly horrific cover I went with all the gushing reviews and gave this book a try.I won't go into the plot since so many others before me have already done so. I will just state the reasoning behind my rating. Some slight spoilers may follow.<br /><br />I enjoyed it for the most part. It was fast, sometimes gripping read with some truly likeable characters (America-Abby's BFF was a stand out) but there was a huge reason as to why this was not five star read for me and no it was not Travis. It was Abby. Please hold the rotten produce while I explain myself. Girls like Abby, who leads a guy on while the whole time pretending they have no clue said guy is head over heels for them, asking said guy to be friends while giving him the completely wrong idea (like sleeping in his bed, for example) have a name around these parts: c**k tease. I thought Abby's insistence on honoring the bet all the while knowing how Travis felt even after she started dating another guy was a good example of this. Even her bff called her out on it. No way she didn't realize that Travis had feelings for her.She chose to ignore it and instead of leaving and calling off the bet when she started dating Parker she decided to play with not one but two guys and their feelings. Oh I know she was supposedly in denial and afraid because Travis brought back all she was trying to run away from but still didn't excuse her wishy washiness. I was also incredibly irritated by her complete inability to communicate with Travis. Instead of telling him about her fears and why she felt she had to leave him she just up and left without any explanation after sleeping with the guy. Not to mention later going into a jealous rage after seeing him with another girl. Hellooo you dumped him! I had no patience for her and her emotional constipation.<br /><br />On the other hand, Travis was an Alpha in every sense of the word. He was rude, crude,prone to fits of violence and marking his territory and I adored him. He was a big lunkhead but sweet, thoughtful and very protective. I agree with some reviewers that his behavior was borderline stalker-ish and obsessive. But it is fiction. If I ever came across a Travis in real life I'm sure I would run in the opposite direction but in my fiction I like 'em big sexy Alphas.<br /><br />In spite of my impatience with Abby being a tease, her emotional immaturity and her ridiculous penchant for drama, I still enjoyed the book. I think it is a testament to the author's skill that I kept reading even while battling my desire to throw my laptop across the room. In the end,despite it's flaws Beautiful Disaster was compulsively readable and I would recommend but with some reservation.unkhead but sweet, thoughtful and very protective.

B004JZBGWI|5.0|I use this on a daily basis. My only complaint is that it needs a &quot;delete completed tasks&quot; option. For example, if I have a checklist with 20 items and 10 are checked off as completed, I want to hold my finger on that checklist and select an option to remove all the completed items. I see an option to Check All or Uncheck All, but not a Clean up type option. Maybe I am missing it since it seems like something that would be there?  So, I go into the checklist and i have to delete each checked item one at a time. :-(
1572816112|5.0|Purchased this deck upon my return to tarot after years of not doing readings. The artwork is beautiful and the scenes and imagery depicted in a dark, surreal manner that conveys quite well those readers who enjoy the darker side of existence. Not to imply that there is anything evil or negative about the deck but for those who feel they must be in tune with a deck this is not for those sensitive to such things. I myself love this deck and found my first draw to be quite accurate and enjoyable.

Baby Doll, the main character, and her svelte companions are on a quest for freedom.  Simple enough.  Just go with it.  Let the CG fantasy worlds wash over you.  Rock and roll to the rattle of machine gun fire.  Watch Baby Doll get busy with her samurai sword and stainless steel handgun.  Enjoy the gorgeous faces (and figures) of Jamie Chung and Vanessa Hudgens.  Again, just go with it.  Don't analyze it to death.  Towering samurai warriors, steampunk zombie soldiers, orcs, and terminator-type robots... all getting whacked by a contingency of young commando babes.  There's a lot of visual goodness here.  If you paid for and then disliked this movie, you didn't do your homework.  If you think Fight Club or American Beauty are \\"important\\" films then something like Sucker Punch may be a bit too straightforward for you.  To the director's credit, Sucker Punch never becomes preachy (like Avatar), and it doesn't pretend to be more than what it is (like the overblown Matrix Trilogy).  The plot rambles much less than the second Transformers film (Revenge of the Fallen) and you'll care more about the main characters, especially Rocket who befriends Baby Doll and then deliberately makes the ultimate sacrifice.  If you liked Underworld Evolution or The Crow you'll probably like Sucker Punch.<br /><br />The movie gives you exactly what you should expect in abundance: entertainment with rich visuals, highly-stylized characters, and thumpin' beats.  The film is a mixture of A Series of Unfortunate Events (unwanted orphans with inheritance), Inception (dream sequences), Resident Evil Afterlife (machine guns, zombies, sword play), and One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest (with Baby Doll being Randle McMurphy and Sweet Pea as Chief Bromden).  Or you could simply remake the Shawshank Redemption with battle mecha and Mila Kunis in lingerie with the fighting skills of Jet Li.  Then add one big dragon, a snazzy bad guy named Blue, a statuesque Polish psychotherapist, and a brooding Gotham City atmosphere.  Many reviews mention the sexual aspects of the film.  Except for the skimpy outfits and moderate innuendo, the movie is not overtly sexual.  There is an element of fan service, but no nudity or even a love scene.  There is only one kiss in the movie and it's stolen.  The theatrical cut is rated PG-13.  Many rap and pop music videos are considerably more tawdry than this movie.  I also find it odd that a few negative reviews call the movie \\"pornographic\\" without also mentioning the really disturbing bits: a little girl (Baby Doll's sister) is killed by her greedy sadistic stepfather, and later in the film two young women are shot to death at point-blank range in cold blood (no graphic details are shown, but it's still very disturbing).s of Jet Li.

0553801473|3.0|I really wanted to enjoy this book, I did. After whetting my appetite by dipping my toes in the water with Game of Thrones and then tearing through the next three volumes voraciously, I awaited with mounting glee as A Dance with Dragons crept closer to its release date and to my front door. Finally, it arrived, and of course I promptly began to read it.<br /><br />What a delight it was to return to the adventures of Jon Snow, Daenarys, and expecially Tyrion. Martin came up with some real zingers for Tyrion, and I hooted out loud several times. I was also happy to see Arya come back, as well as Bran, Jaime, Davos, and Cersei, although all of their chapters were brief (Theon was sort of in the middle).<br /><br />Now, what did I think of Martin's latest effort? Well, as my headline indicates, I wasn't terribly impressed with it. Besides a few significant and important moments, much of the material felt like it was devoted to setting up for the next book. The reading slogged in several parts and I found myself kind of wanting to get it over with, and that's not a good sign. I think Martin overdid it in this book, trying to do too much and ending up with more fat than meat. Don't get me wrong, he's one of my favorite authors, but even the great ones screw up sometimes. Also, I think his Achilles' Heel is simply introducing waaaaayyyy too many characters. It's very easy to get lost on who's who and who does what, especially with the plots over in Mereen (I assume this is part of the infamous Mereenese Knot that has given Martin fits). I think he would do well to just stick with half as many and leave it at that and focus on them. I read somewhere that there were 18 different POV chapters in this book alone. 18! Game of Thrones only had 8 or so, and that's part of the reason why it was such a great book, it was still complex but not so much so that it became a chore to follow it. This book is, unfortunately, and with that, I really give it a 2.5/5 stars but Amazon doesn'tdo half stars.<br /><br />Here's hoping Winds of Winter will make up for this one (and Feast of Crows, which I may consider better than this one, by the way).
B0043URV8M|3.0|I was disappointed that the song Harry & Hermione danced to was not on the soundtrack. After some searching, I found the song. It's called \\"O Children\\" by Nick Cave & The Bad Seeds. I just downloaded the MP3 from Amazon. It's wonderful!

0817439390|5.0|This book is an excellent step for people who want to do more with their cameras than pointing and shooting. Its advice applies to users of any type of camera: point and shoot or dslr, film or digital. It clarified several points for me (especially on aperture and metering) that I had not been able to completely figure out from reading photography blogs. I highly recommend this book to anyone looking for a basic photography primer, or trying to take advantage of a dslr. It's also beautifully illustrated.
B004KNM3EY|5.0|A great album get the deluxe treatment.  All of Suedes back catalog is getting re-released and package with a bonus  cd of B-sides and non-album material.   You also get a dvd of the promo videos and a concert(s)  from the tour of the album,  not some crap  filmed 20 yrs later.  Suede has really set the standard, I wish more bands would follow in their footsteps.  It was very common in the 80's and 90's for British bands to release a number  of non-album b side singles, and in some cases they would issue 'EP's' in  between albums, like in the case of My Bloody Valentine and Ride.  It can be quite confusing trying to figure out what to buy so you don't miss out.  Now Suede dumps everything that was released during that time period  on the appropriate album.  This album had the bands most 'hits', as the album  generated 5 top ten UK singles.  So it's a bit more poppy than the previous  two albums, but no less the classic !    I see in the upcoming months Jesus and Mary Chain are re-releasing  their back catalog in the same manner of Suede. Good- hope to see more do it.  The only ones that come close are the Boo Radleys.  The re-released their catalog  with all the EP/Singles put on the regular releases- only no concert dvds which is a shame  but they all can't be perfect like Suede.
1594744769|4.0|To everyone that has given this book a harsh review because of limited character/plot development; please remember that this book is essentially young adult fiction.  This means that teenagers, not college professors, are reading the book for entertainment purposes.  The book isn't meant to be Lord of the Flies or 1984.  It's just for fun.  With that said, I thought this book was an interesting read.  The characters were likeable and the storyline was different.  I, like many other reviewers, felt that the ending left a lot to be desired, but if there is a sequel, or if this book turns into a series, then it has the standard cliffhanger ending.    If you enjoy fantasy literature and want to escape into a different world, give this book a chance.  The pictures and the sections with handwriting are definitely difficult to read if you buy this book on Kindle, so that does take a bit away from the book.  The beginning is a bit slow, but I never lost interest and I often put books down if the first few chapters don't spike my interest.
030726999X|5.0|Super book, read all three.  Amazing writer, too bad he is no longer with us.  Quite violent but very well written with an extreme slant on the strength of women throughout European history.  Thanks for delivering in a timely fashion.  D

B004Y1USV2|4.0|While other classic rock bands are complacent with re-releasing their music in different forms or covers , Yes inspires us again with their ageless creativity . Their craft to compose,arrange and play is still ahead of many bands in today's rock scene or other genre of music because ... who can actually label Yes music? Anyway , you will not be disappointed .
B000NPS2NY|4.0|I reread TTSP in preparation for the new film.  It has been a long time since I read it when it first came out.  I was surprised that George Smiley came across as so petulant.  I hadn't remembered him that way.  The plot was pretty convoluted and I didn't remember having as much trouble keeping everyone straight.<br /><br />Still LeCarre does some things quite masterfully especially in developing his secondary characters and establishing some of the places like the school.
1400079144|1.0|I was amazed at the completely transparent and predictable plot. There is no reason to read more than the first 50-75 pages. I was very disappointed at the poor writing, lack of character development & lame plot 'twists'. Just say NO to this one.

B004X8W42M|5.0|I read \\" off the Rails \\" written by a band member and walked away from that book thinking that Ozzy was just disgusting and foul. Now after reading his book i find out just how funny he really is and not stupid like people think. I now have a new found love for the guy and wish him the best with the rest of his life. Hopefully he can stay clean for the rest of his life. Was a great read!
B005D9MUWY|5.0|After having used this app on my HTC Evo 4G for awhile now... I'm really liking it. I replaced the default keyboard using the SwiftKey X and couldn't be any happier. It's almost similar to the default HTC Evo 4G layout, but more compressed.<br /><br />I feel that a good price for it would be $1.99, so don't purchase it at full price.
B000003S5H|5.0|WOW! All I can say is this is such beautiful, mesmerizing, incredibly relaxing mind music! The track, \\"La Femme D'Argent,\\" is absolutely brilliant - a true masterpiece. If you can appreciate many different musical genres and styles - and especially instrumental music - then you should like this CD. If what you want to hear is mindless guitar riffing, rapping or lyric-heavy pop schlop or repetitive dance club music, then you won't like it. It's music that has a bit of a hip jazz feel; it's electronica, its got an R&B soul - it's really space-pop-jazz for the thinking person. And I say this as a person who finds almost all modern electronica horrifically boring and repetitive. The trouble with most electronica music is that most such bands come up with a cool riff or a few interesting bits, but then they simply repeat them over and over and stretch them out to boringly ridiculous lengths. \\"Moon Safari\\" shows its gifted composers using cleverly interwoven themes and motifs. Great stuff!
1567184855|2.0|I am halfway through this and am not sure I can finish. I am a past life regressionist and the information in this book is not what I have experienced either in the role of the subject or the role of the facilitator. The souls who have passed on (either as guides or the past life of the client) in this book are very human. They have human emotions, desires, appearances, faults, and status. The status part is the most disturbing part of it all. I suppose it is human nature to want to categorize things and we can only describe anything from how we see the world from our own lens, but I think that leads this author into some really wild, unreliable territory. I would NOT rely on this book as your source of what it is like on the other side, finding your soul purpose, or satisfying your curiosity about life after death.<br /><br />For those who want to know what it's really like, my suggestion is to put the book down and get your own regression. Reading about it or watching someone else does not constitute \\"proof\\" as people can lie under hypnosis. However, there is an emotional quality that happens in regression that let's you know that what you are experiencing is real. It doesn't happen every time (due to the lack of connection between hypnotist and client, the hypnotist's skill level, etc), but when it does, you will feel very satisfied -regardless of whether it is a positive or negative experience- that you experienced something meaningful.
B0055B0MIO|5.0|Trivium just keeps impressing after The Crusade which was a great metal album but no screaming and a different tone they went back to basics and the screaming and melodic combination and it worked brilliantly on Shogun.  In Waves expands on that proving that Trivium just keeps growing as a band I really enjoy this album from top to bottom it has a little of everything and is still very heavy as well.  My favorite tracks are \\"Caustic Are The Ties That Bind\\",\\"Inception of The End\\",\\"Built To Fall\\",\\"Forsake Not The Dream\\",\\"A Skylines Severance\\".....there are just so many great songs it's hard to narrow them down.  Definitely recommend the special edition with 5 bonus tracks and a bonus DVD with extras.

It is frustrating to know that they will continue to eat the SAD diet. If you are interested in your health, please read this book!
0817439390|5.0|I bought this book with the purchase of my first DSLR. It was the only source I needed for understanding the relationship between shutter speed, aperture, and ISO. I have never taken a photo in automatic mode since reading it...which has led my photographs to improve immensely. I had planned on taking an introduction to photography class but found this book taught me more than enough to satisfy me. The cost of this book is nothing compared to what it can do when you understand what's going on outside the automatic setting. Understanding Exposure is a MUST read for any one new to the DSLR camera! I highly, highly, highly, recommend it!
B000059HAI|3.0|This DVD was a replacement for the VHS tape I have. I was very disappointed in the DVD in that the sound was very poor in listening to the Japanese segments, you could bearly here them. This is not a version that I can recommend to anybody.

I gave my neighbors the one that works and they ended up giving it back to me since mine didn't.  They said it doesn't do anything anyway.  It's true.  It does nothing but make noise, it doesn't pick anything up.  Some people say it's basically an electric dust pan.  Perhaps I'll try using it on that.  I was hoping for something that would make vacuuming up the steps easier.  Nope!  70 bucks down the drain.  I never return anything, but I will write a review so no one makes the same mistake.  You thinking of buying one?  You can have mine for free.  I don't even want to see them anymore.  Oh, what a waste!
B004RC8NUQ|4.0|I enjoyed this movie vewry much.  I can't wait to see Ashten Kutcher in next seasons  two and a half men. He shiold be terific.
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|Before reading the Millennium Trilogy, I heard a lot about it being misogynist because of the numerous depictions of sexual violence against women. After reading them all, however, I don't think that the books are misogynist. Many of the characters are, but they are not glorified and generally are punished, often by an extremely badass woman. This doesn't read as misogynist to me. I don't know if I would call it feminist, either, but the author is clearly not a fan of traditional patriarchy or the security state. The books caution against giving too much respect (and therefore, power) to people who are merely rich, claim to have information that you cannot be allowed to know or who are just placed in positions of power. In this final book, Lisbeth continues her serious badass-ery and uses her smarts to outwit a number of baddies while learning to actually trust some of the decent people around her. She is a great character, and I wish Larsson would have been able to write more books.<br /><br />His portrayal of strong, independent woman characters is something sorely missing from most popular literature and the fact that he can embrace an 'abnormal' girl as the most badass of all, without needing to describe her as being blindingly beautiful is great. I also really appreciate that he allows his main male protagonist (Blomkvist) to be attracted to a number of different kinds of women, all described as sexy, but not all described as traditionally beautiful. It's nice to see a book understanding and proclaiming that a woman can be attractive for a number of different reasons, not all of which are about her physical appearance being in accordance with current social preferences.<br /><br />Anyways, I really liked the books and I liked the author. I think he really is feminist in thought and wants to bring attention to the misogyny inherent in many systems, and not just in the obvious ways depicted in the book. Sure, most of it is quite obvious, but other messages are there, too. He points out how the system is gamed against Lisbeth for a number of reasons, and not all of them have to do with her heritage. Her sex is enough to start things against her, which he points out definitively in the third book by way of the relationship between Zalachenko and Niedermann. I think the series is a great start on a critique of current social structures, even in a country as advanced and progressive as Sweden. If a country that clearly cares about its female population can be as anti-woman as he portrays, what happens in a country that is almost outright misogynist, like the U.S.?oints out how the system is gamed against Lisbeth for a number of reasons, and not all of them have to do with her heritage.

B0055PMUSU|4.0|I don't understand all the hype about religion or faith being a major theme in the movie. The girl was a member of a youth group and volunteered to pass out food to help tsunami victims. That's far from uniquely Christian and its not portrayed that way. The movie said \\"Jesus\\" maybe twice. Not the immense proclamation of faith it's been made out to be. At one point the mother says, \\"Please don't take her\\". What mother wouldn't say that? What movie wouldn't portray the mother that way? Honestly, I wouldn't have even known it was a \\"Christian themed\\" movie without watching the DVD extras, which were much more overtly preachy.    I'm not Christian and I loved the movie. I keep my daughters away from things that will try to spoonfeed them any religion and I had them watch this because the girl's bravery is an inspiration. They loved it and are now all about learning to surf.
B002RKSXJG|4.0|An interesting Victorian mystery, but some of the narrators were rather insufferable. I found it hard to read some of them and make it through their sections. It was also rather trying to read the assertions of the inherent inferiority of women as expressed by one of the main characters, but really, I expect this kind of thing and understand it was part of the period.
8131500527|2.0|First of all, this is a good book and I have no problem with its content. I have ordered the paperback edition of this book not realizing that it is a special edition printed in India, not intended for the market in the US. The quality of the paper on which it is printed is sub-par and it arrived slightly damaged as well. The binding is not well done, on some of the pages it is difficult to read the text close to the middle. While it is much cheaper than the US hardcover, the quality of the US printing is much better and worth the price difference.
B002RKSZWG|4.0|This wasn't my favorite Jane Austen, but I liked the main character better than some of the others I've read, like Emma. The main character, Anne, was sympathetic, and you felt bad for her through much of the book when she was putting up with the other insufferable characters. Jane Austen's books always manage to make me very glad that I didn't live in the Victorian Era. It would have been terrible to not be able to escape the very awful relations always described in her books. The expectations of poor relations seem nearly unbearable. I wouldn't have been able to bear the types of jabs Mary aimed at Anne regularly. It makes me very glad to live in a time when a woman earning her own living is not seen as a disreputable person.
0553108034|5.0|Amazing second part. It was even better than the first book which is hard to believe. Can't wait to get through the 3rd book.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|Absolutely as good as everyone was telling me. And the further I got into the book, the more it flew. Really great.<br /><br />If you've been thinking about doing it, just read it already.  It's fantastic.
B0050PYNN0|1.0|An aquaintance leant me this: 'You like all that 'Lord of the Rings' rubbish, you'll love this.' Well, he couldn't have been more wrong. I'm giving it one star because awarding a lower score isn't possible.    Imagine a particularly unfunny episode of Krod Mandoon,(go on, there are plenty to chose from)fill it full of purile humour, Knob-jokes and homophobic jibes that a 12 year old would find embarrassing, drench it in overblown special effects to make it look lie a 'real' fantasy epic and you have an inkling of just how bad this film is. The cast, for the most part seem to be phoning in their performances, there's even one guy playing a barbarian whose acting is so terrible his one and only line sounds as if he's reciting a shopping list. (in the inaptly named gag-reel included in the extras, there's even footage of the actor in question reading is stage directions out as part of his lines!)The whole sorry business is epicly unfunny and best avoided.
B004G600A4|5.0|This is a really cute movie, and I don't buy movies usually, but this one gets better and better every time you watch it, so we had to own it. My whole family loves it, even the husband and boys! But I bought it for my 5 year old daughter who now refuses to cut her hair :)

0545259088|5.0|Okay, I've seen where a few think that this last book in this trilogy left a lot to be desired. I can say that I certainly see why some feel this way, but I want to explain why I give this one 5 stars..<br /><br />I simply loved the entire book! There was closure for everyone including Beck and Grace's parents & Isabel & her family. OMG even Cole! I was wondering from book 2 and most of this book, how in the world will these people go on or where will they end up? The thing is everyone and I do mean everyone's lives took to a path that was not far fetched, was completely believable and certainly reflected real life. Reality.<br /><br />As I said, because of how intense this entire book is and the way it ended I understand some being disappointed. But I wasn't. It was refreshing to me. It still explained alot.. When it comes to the execution, the plot and how all of it came together, I think it's the best book out of the series.<br /><br />There is alot of action, alot of emotion, uncertainty and things left open. I even came to like Isabel in this one. I could not stand her in the 1st and 2nd book. And of course Cole & Beck broke my heart as usual. Sam & Grace the ever beautiful picture of Love & Sacrifice. You just have to read this one.<br /><br />You are left with a cliff hanger of sorts, but this is the last book. I suggest once you read this one, read the author's note right after.. And then start the entire series all over again. :D<br /><br />I highly recommend this read. Read all 3 books. It was an awesome trilogy.
B003JSSPSY|5.0|1 gorgeous brunette (Kahlan) + 1 stunning warrior blonde (Cara) in tight leather<br />= 5/5 stars! :-)<br /><br />Do I need any other reason to watch this fantasy series?<br /><br />The plot is OK. The fight scenes can look cheesy (notice the lack of fake blood on their weapons). With 2 hot warrior ladies around, who cares about the hero and their seemingly endless journeys?
1936719118|5.0|I bought and read this book following a comment by Tim Ferriss, who praised the book as a marvelous approach to business. Not only was Mr. Ferriss right, he was also short on his statements about the book. It is refreshing, it is direct and simple (which is radically difficult to find)and wisely mixes work, leisure and philosophy from the author. It reminded me \\"Letters to Lucilio\\", by classical Roman Seneca.Buy it, steal it, borrow it... but read it.
B000BB1MI2|3.0|I've never been a fan of Tim Burton.  I've liked very few of his movies.  I thought the Charlie & The Chocolate Factory, along with Johnny Depp could possibly turn things around for me, and it did, in a way... the movie wasn't great, but it also wasn't bad.  It's sort of an in-between movie.<br /><br />There were flashes of brilliance, such as the over the top Oompa Loompa songs (especially the one following Augustus Gloop getting sucked up into the vacuum -- brilliant!), and I also like how this movie went more into detail about why Willy Wonka is the way he is, and why he's obsessed with chocolate.  That was something the original movie completely neglected, and I thought Burton did a great job implementing into the movie.<br /><br />There were also some epic fails, such as the Oompa Loompa's themselves.  Every single Oompa Loompa was the same actor, just CGI'd into a hundred different ones.  The original movie had a bunch of \\"Little People\\" playing the part, which I thought was a much better way of going about it.  I also didn't care for some of the obscure Tim Burton oddities, such as the crooked, Sleepy Hollow looking house Charlie's family lived in, amongst other things.  Johnny Depp delivered a pretty solid performance as Willy Wonka, but he didn't even come close to Gene Wilder's portrayal.  Depp in comparison was like comparing a minor leaguer to an All-Star professional.<br /><br />The characters in the movie were excellent. I thought they did a great job with the casting, and the the kids all did great jobs.  I especially liked the new Charlie.  I liked him even better than the original Charlie.  I didn't care for the new Grandpa Joe, however.  Tim Burton, in his typical fashion, picked just about the ugliest man you'll ever see in your life as Grandpa Joe.  He was an eyesore throughout the film.<br /><br />In in all, it was an \\"ok\\" movie. It certainly had its moments, and I have watched it 4 or 5 times since it's been released.  I own the DVD, and I can certainly say that it's entertaining to watch.  I just don't think it holds a candle to the original one, which was a masterpiece.  I just think this one fell a bit short.  If it weren't for amazon's flawed ratings system, I'd give this movie 3.5 stars, but it's certainly not a 4 star movie, which is why I gave it 3.rtaining to watch.

B000S6LT42|5.0|A MUST FOR ANYONE WHO KNOWS THE STONES!  So far I have watched only the Rio Concert in this set...twice!  Jaw dropping stage set up and crowd. From first note to last...The Stones are rocking Rio like no one else can.  I have to say, I would be very satisfied if that was all there was to this DVD set.  Can't get no satisfaction? ...Yes you can, just buy this DVD set and watch!  Looking forward to watching the rest...!

0385341679|5.0|AMAZING book, AMAZING series in fact.  It's very hard not to give \\"spoilers\\" but I am going to try, this book marks the end of the series, we follow the last adventures of Mac. I looked forward to this book after the cliffangher of the last volume, and I wasnt disapointed, on the contrary!   We continue to discover the characters while keeping a note of mystery, we finally learn who the killer of Alina is and the sex scenes are to die for! (of pleasure of course)   the end is really good, generally after you've read the last volume in the end of a series, you're always a little dissapointed, but thats not the case, the end really closed the door of the series and let us keep windows to imagine what could happens next.  I deeply recommend this book. If you have not bought it yet, do it, you will not regret it!!    PS: i loved this series so much that I bought the books in french and English! thank God I manage in English thats what allowed me not to wait for the french release. :):)    French readers thats for u :):)    Magnifique livre, Magnifique serie en fait.  C'est trés dur de ne pas donner de \\"spoilers\\" mais je vais essayer, ce livre marque la fin de la série, on suit les dernières aventures de Mac accompagnée de Barrons.  Je l'attendais avec impatience aprés le cliffangher du dernier tome et je n'ai pas était décu bien au contraire!   On continue de découvrir les personnages tout en gardant une note de mystère, les scènes de sexe sont à mourir (de plaisir)et la fin est vraiment bien ficellé, en général aprés avoir lu le dernier tome de la fin d'une série on est toujours un peu décu, mais la pas du tout, la fin clos vraiment le livre tout en nous permettant d'imaginer une suite possible!   J'ai adoré je recommande vivement ce livre si vous ne l'avez pas encore acheté faite le vous ne le regretterez pas!!    PS: jai tellement aimé cette série que je l'ai acheté en francais et anglais dieu merci je me débrouille en anglais ce qui m'a permisde ne pas attendre la sortie francaise de ce livre...)

I dont like to see the gd word in books, but it was in this book numerous times! The photos were such an added bonus to take you even furthur into the book! I couldnt put this book down! I'm  awaiting the next book (minus the cursing). I think anyone who says this book isnt any good has no imagination at all! Mine is HUGE, so I really enjoyed this book! Do buy, do go to a magic place! ENJOY!

0060936223|3.0|While the writing in this book is exceptional, the truthful facts are not told. Anyone who knew Patti and Robert 1968-1979, knows that they both were after the big-wigs with money, straight from the beginning.  After all,  the film  Black, White and Gray portrays a more accurate picture of Sam Wagstaff being Robert's sugar daddy.  As well, those who were there, know, that after Robert got Sam to buy the Bond Street loft for him, there was the condition that a part of the building house the Patti Smith Groups practice space. Patti wrote Just Kids, furious at the Patricia Morrisroe biography \\"Mapplethorpe\\", which is as flawed as \\"Just Kids\\" is.  This is a nice, \\"Wendy\\" tells stories for \\"Pan\\" (Robert). After all Robert did an auto-portrait of himself called \\"Pan\\", and, Patti used to pretend to be Wendy telling stories to Robert. At least that is admitted in this this book.  The only thing good about this book is the good writing. OTHERWISE, it's a fairy tale !!!  Ask Patti about snorting cocaine with Nicki Weymouth and others. She won't admit it. But I saw it happen. And, much more.  Fairy tales are fun, but remember, they are not the TRUTH.   To get a well rounded picture of the truth, how their lives evolved, one must see the DVD Black, White and Gray.
B000EHSVSC|5.0|An outstanding historical depiction of the events leading to the  Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor on Dec. 7,1941. This is a movie  that is a \\"must see\\" for everyone.
0143038419|5.0|I can't say anything about the book itself. I haven't read it, I only ordered it for my wife. It came quickly and seemed to be in new condition. I ordered it Friday night and had the package Monday morning.
0553386794|5.0|Great for fans of: The Lord of the Rings, Pillars of the Earth and books with maps and appendices.<br /><br />My Take: The size of the book may scare some, but Martin employs a wonderful technique where each chapter is from the point of view of a different character (of which there are plenty, I assure you...) and consequently you forget how long the book is (actually, I promise you will be wanting more at the end and you're in luck friend...).<br /><br />The action is swift and brutal. \\"Winter is coming...\\" and you had better be prepared for the turns and twists around every corner.<br /><br />The descriptive paragraphs are beautiful, but a little long-winded for my taste. However, I see my impatience with them as a testament to Martin's brilliance in writing dialogue and how quickly I became invested in the fates of the characters. (Enough forest description already, George, what the heck is happening with Jon Snow?!!)<br /><br />Final Verdict: TNT with a long fuse. It takes a hot minute to get into, but once you do, get ready for the big bang!
B0041OJ0Y8|4.0|What do you get when you mix South African rap with techno beats, a Vanilla Ice look-alike who seems to have some sort of disorder, and a small blonde woman with a mullet who has a cute yet nutty appeal? Die Antwoord is the answer.<br /><br />If you were one to catch these people via their videos on Youtube you most likely thought it was a joke. The songs come off very wacky, super catchy (especially Rich B****), and sort of vulgar but most of the time those vulgarities being in Afrikaans or some sort of South African slang means the joke is over us U.S. listeners heads. Quite a few times I had to Google terms from the tracks to realize what in the heck they were getting it.<br /><br />That being said this album is like nothing I have heard before. My taste ranges from Rap, to Death Metal, Motown, Soul, and anything in between. The rapping can be a bit chaotic and not even rhyme, but in some way they make it work. The main man in the group is Ninja, who will constantly spell his name out for you in a quite a few of the songs, along while referring to Game Boy. The woman's name is Yo-Landi Vi$$er, she is a cute little pixie of a woman with a gold tooth, a mullet, and a whiny yet very catchy voice. Oh by the way, she also seems to enjoy eating and rapping about Nutella. And last but not least we have DJ Hi-Tek, the mix master of the group who seems to also be in on the satirical rap group known as Die Antwoord.<br /><br />Each song has some sort of catchy hooks, random yelling or cursing, and a European sounding flavor. It's probably the most different yet refreshing music I have heard in a long while. The comedic style of these three along with their actual very competent abilities will hopefully produce more tracks from this group for a long while to come. This fun yet trashy kind of style known as \\"Zef\\" clearly has found it's fan base. Hopefully you can keep your mind open and give it a listen.<br /><br />If you can kind of laugh at your music, not take it too seriously yet still want to bob your head and sing. This most likely will be for you. If you like serious music, weather it be singing about love or rapping about the streets. I would most likely stay back. After one album I can call myself a big fan of Die Antwoord, here's hoping Mike Patton can get in on this and do a Bungle/Antwoord album =). They seem like they would be the perfect fit!<br /><br />Grade Wise: B (Would have been a B+ had they had one or two more tracks)head and sing. This most likely will be for you. If you like serious music, weather it be singing about love or rapping about the streets. I would most likely stay back. After one album I can call myself a big fan of Die Antwoord, here's hoping Mike Patton can get in on this and do a Bungle/Antwoord album =). They seem like they would be the perfect fit!

B000LPQ6DE|5.0|I have seen the other versions or remakes,but this version was best one of all. I was so impressed I had to buy it after I rented it from Netflix. It is now one of my favorite movies. Great cast, great acting and story. Toby Stephens is the best Edward Rochester I have seen so far. He was born for this role. I could watch this one over and over and not tire of it. Very entertaining.
B004TB6GQI|5.0|This is one of my favorite albums to come out this year. Everyone has heard her song Jar of Hearts by now I'm sure. Every song on this album is as great as that one. I can never get enough of Christina's voice, it is so beautiful and unique. Go out and buy this album, you won't regret it!
B001HNE3NO|5.0|A friend reccommended this book to me to read. I enjoy reading Holocaust stories, so I knew I would like this book. I was a great read, sad and challenging at times, but I couldn't put it down. Challenging in the sense that I cant believe these events actually happened in history. I would highly recommend this novel! Wish the ending was more defined so I wouldn't have to assume and create my own...
B001MVYUPC|5.0|I can't add anything to the many reviews praising this film; it's definitely one that shouldn't be missed.  What I will add is the value of seeing the original film in high definition.  Among its 8 Oscars are the awards for Best Cinematography and Best Art Direction, meaning the visual experience is on par with the storyline and acting.  If you're looking to buy for the first time or replace that old VHS copy, there's no question about it; I would say it's even worth replacing your DVD version for the Blu-Ray.

B004XJHBCE|5.0|Incredibly useful application. I use it every day. I love that you can assign multiple tags to a single application. I also like that you can favorite apps and then create a folder that gathers up all your favorites in one place. So, I can have ebay in my shopping folder and my favorites folder, which resides on my front screen. A very useful app. I&apos;m glad I got it for free or I wouldn&apos;t have discovered this gem. Now I tell all my fellow android users about it.
B0041KKYBA|5.0|This is a must viewing. The coming global recession is due to the failure to correct the problems raised in this presentation. The premise that Wall Street runs the US government is reflected by current events. Obama identified the wolves who caused the 2008 financial holocaust is now also a lackey of the predators in Wall Street. This photoplay shows that whoever is elected president in 2012 will play by the same rules.

0062060554|4.0|I could not put the book down because I love a good psychological thriller.  I appreciated the insights into this disorder and how it affects those closest to the victim.  The book is a roller coaster ride of self-discovery as the main character, Christine wakes up every day forgetting anything except her long term memories pre-marriage.  So she doesn't recognize her husband or her current life and even has to wrestle with an aging body.  Through the help of a psychiatrist, she keeps a journal which at least helps her 'read' her life every day, if not remember it.  Because she now has the journal, she begins to discover discrepancies between what she writes and what her husband is telling her in some very important instances of her life.  Let the fun begin!  Bravo for a first novel - but I did find the ending rather implausible.  I also could not get past the fact that Jonathan Nolan did this story first, and possibly with more suspense, with the short story Memento upon which a film was based.
B004SMDJ9U|5.0|I bought this series during a lightning deal of the day. I have never watched the show before. But I like Sci-Fi movies and tv shows. I read a few reviews before the purchase.

0553801473|4.0|Well, I am well and truly caught up with the story arc so far, and that is satisfying. There is much and more to like here. But on the little and less side, I have some quibbles. I have been willing to put up with the lists of names, shield devices, and sigils I will never remember and the detailing of even the smallest of small clothes in the service of \\"being there.\\" But I can't help but be disappointed in the failure to give previously detailed characters the smallest of progression, relegating them to the chronic cliche of their theme song (I'm looking at you, Princess Shireen and Patches, oh, oh, oh). People with interesting back story and condition who should have had at least one further part to play to justify their existence. And one newish character with whom we spend a lot of time and learn to care about to some extent, only to have that time seem pointless in the end. But oh, yeah, if I am still above the grass when volume 6 comes out, I'll be right there in line.<br /><br />Kudos on the other reviews that point out other unsatisfying aspects.

B00003CXCW|5.0|Viewed: 5/05, 5/06, 7/11<br />Rate: 10<br /><br />5/05: Sunset Boulevard is a very dark and provocative picture. William Holden is superb, but it's Gloria Swanson who steals the film in every scene. Although the narration is a bit annoying in the beginning, Sunset Boulevard gets better and better to the end. Then, there is an omnipotent message of this film that seems to transcend itself in the real meaning of what's moral about life. There are two intriguing perspectives that split the movie up into two halves: the good and the bad. It's the bad that seems to win out over the good. So, the ending is very justified. This film will stand out to be one of all-time great classics.<br /><br />5/06: To refuse to acknowledge this film is to be considered as a crime. Sunset Boulevard is one of the finest black-and-white classics made. More importantly, it is a true film noir that is extremely dark and chilling in its manner, emerging at the point of being an horror film that breathes insanity in Norma Desmond, played terrifically by Gloria Swanson, not as uncommon as Psycho's Norman Bates and Whatever Happened to Baby Jane's Baby Jane Hudson. The sharp introduction of Sunset Boulevard gives the feeling, quite easy at that, of being reminded that Sunset Boulevard will be no ordinary film. From the start to the end, the results becomes more extraordinary right up to the finale. The strict and beautiful writing by Billy Wilder is evident throughout the film. As chilling as it feels, the remarkableness of Sunset Boulevard is how well shot the scenes are and how the word film noir is being defined to the precise meaning of the word. The three players (William Holden, Erich von Stroheim, and Gloria Swanson) are what makes Sunset Boulevard possible. Of course, no surprise at all, Sunset Boulevard fails to score the big ones at the Academy Awards, but realistically, it should have. Moreover, Sunset Boulevard is one of the brilliant films that must be seen by everyone. Dark, cold, and chillingly hallow, Sunset Boulevard is the film to be seen to be appreciated.<br /><br />7/11: Gloria Swanson gives one of the greatest and most legendary performances as Norma Desmond the fading silent movie actress in Sunset Boulevard. She captivates and arrests every scene she is in, and everybody else is in an awe of her. It's no wonder why it is one of the top ten or fifteen greatest films ever made on anyone's list. It's just that good.w, Sunset Boulevard is the film to be seen to be appreciated.    7/11: Gloria Swanson gives one of the greatest and most legendary performances as Norma Desmond the fading silent movie actress in Sunset Boulevard.

0439023521|5.0|I bought this book not knowing exactly what to expect. I have seen it at my local bookstore under the young adult section, and because of that reason it never interested me. I ran out of books to read this summer that were already on my list, so I was browsing the Kindle ebooks and stumbled across Hunger Games. How can you not read a book that has maintained such good ratings with 2000+ reviews? I read it and LOVED it. I devoured all three books in less than 48 hours. It is unlike anything I have ever read; the story is bittersweet but so true to itself. Suzanne doesn't hold back any punches, and it is a wild ride through every single page. It's definitely not for you if you like quintessential happy endings. Hunger Games is going on my must read again shelf without a doubt! Warning: this book is not for the faint of heart.
0553801473|5.0|I like to start reading a series after all the books are released.  However, I find it irresistable to set a book down once I get into it.  I waited years and years with the rest of you.  Reread the first four books, preordered the fifth.  I liked it very much.  The suspense has been built up for the sixth.  I want to read the next one now, but will probably go backwards again before I can move forward.  Lucky for us there are lots of other things to get interested in.  (I hope Rothfuss doesn't take 10 years to publish the 3rd book of his Name of the Wind series).
0312600844|1.0|I read this book for a book club and had to force myself to finish it.  I had enjoyed Franzen's \\"Corrections\\" years earlier and was looking forward to his next book.  Other than the first chapter of \\"Freedom\\", I disliked this book intensely. This minimally plotted book has troubled characters finding themselves in absurd situations.  Franzen may be mirroring a dysfunctional America, but this story is so bleak and ridiculous that I can not recommend it.  Since I've finished \\"Freedom\\", I've had many conversation with other readers and have found only one person who liked it and was unable to articulate the reasons why.  Even months after reading this book my distaste for it is still strong, so I've decided to add my \\"one star\\" to the many other readers that are puzzled with this book's popularity.
B003R4ZMNQ|4.0|First Off, I must admit I didn't grow up on the old show; it was a bit before my time. But that hasn't stopped me from loving every minute of the new season! I stumbled upon it while channel surfing & now it is the highlight of my Monday. Both Steve & Danny are HOT! (but Danny's my # 1 =) & the actors bring a chemistry to the screen that can (in my opinion) make or break a piece of work. Love their banter, love their characters. I need cop dramas like normal people need water But a lot of them are so in your face violent! This show has an element of danger without the in your face gore which is nice & focuses on character development more. Great show, cant wait to buy! Definitely give it a chance!
B0044RUSZM|5.0|The Elevator stand is a perfect edition to you desk. Its great in my case because my laptop is hooked up to an external monitor and it keeps it at the same height as the monitor. It also has great cable management, I placed a USB hub under the elevator and it looks nice, neat, and organized. Also the shipping was free and fast, it arrived one day early. The packaging was protective and covered in bubble pouches. The setup for the Elevator Stand was so simple and it only took me under a minute to assemble. I forgot to mention that it has two holding clips that keep the laptop from falling, but that shouldn't be a problem because the ELevator has two strong rubber strips that avoid the laptop from sliding off it. As for the looks, it adds a nice feel and look to your desk. It kind of has the same aluminum design as for the Apple Imac. It has a nice crystal bezel on the bottom with the griffin logo on it. Overall I highly recommend this to everyone, and if your worried it won't work with you laptop, it will. Just apply the holding clips accordingly if you think it might fall. This is a must for ones computer setup!
B0028MBKVG|5.0|Christopher McDougall's tale of the Tarahumara tribe in Mexico charts brand-new territory. Most readers go in with the notion that the marathon is among the toughest challenges in sport. But the Tarahumara and a small group of Westerners known as 'ultras' regularly go 50 to 100 miles non-stop. It is in the investigation of the limits of human endurance that the author comes across some fascinating discoveries in human evolution, biology, and health.<br /><br />The prevailing notion is that human are walking animals, like the pig and chimpanzee. Running animals like horses and dogs are quadripeds with tails. A tailless biped does not make sense in terms of a runner. But that is only a superficial look at human anatomy and physiology. People were designed not to run fast, but to run far. In a 50 mile man-against-horse run, it is actually quite common for man to win. The reason lies with the uniquely human capacity to take two breaths per stride. A horse can take just a single breath per stride. Over long distances, the extra oxygen carried to the muscles makes a huge difference, giving human hunters a small advantage over sprinter-prey such as the gazelle.<br /><br />Another advantage is our internal cooling mechanism. Only humans are capable of sweating. Other animals pant. The panting inhibits running, forcing the animal to slow down. In high temperatures, this edge is magnified--meaning people can theoretically run down any number of fast grazing animals on the hunt. The portions of [[ASIN:B0028MBKVG Born to Run]] where McDougall juxtaposes humans, neanderthals, and animals are some of the very best in contemporary nonfiction.<br /><br />There is a lot here for readers to take issue with. An inordinate amount of time is spent arguing that humans are meant to run barefoot rather than in thick-soled Nikes. This seems obvious enough, why evolve a foot instead of a hoof or some other thick, less sensitive apparatus? Fans of the [[ASIN:B004I9YAVO Vibram Fivefingers KSO]] or [[ASIN:B0055R3VJA Nike Free Run+ 2]] will get all the data they need for spending money on shoes that wear like naturally bare feet. The author has some good points, but overall it detracts from a story that centers around the best modern athletes facing off against the best ancient athletes.<br /><br />Born to Run is near impossible to put down. Well-written, intricately detailed, and compellingly original--Christopher McDougall can take credit for a new classic in sports literature.Nike Free Run+ 2]] will get all the data they need for spending money on shoes that wear like naturally bare feet.

B003UESJEM|3.0|Before my husband and I watched this video, my opinion of \\"Company Men\\"  had been harsh,<br />  I would gather that most people have a bitter taste regarding  big shots.<br /><br /> This DVD lets the viewer see what happens in their world, especially how they treat each  when hard times turn their lives up side down.<br /><br /> The rug jerked out from under them.<br /><br />How they deal with unemployment, a complete change of their life style.<br /><br /> Although, if I had given this any thought ... they step on people going up the ladder surly on the way down they get their's.<br /><br />It's about their friends, how much they really like each other, their wives and how they deal with their husbands downgrade.<br /><br />Toward the end of this DVD, opinions vary, I do not want to release spoilers, as I might  if I continue.<br /><br />I enjoyed this DVD, probably not one I would watch again, probably not my first or second choice for purchase. 3 stars.

0553801473|3.0|I dearly love epic fantasy. But. After slogging through some of the mire of words, endless words, and plot threads and new characters (who are these people?) this eagerly-waited-for edition disgorged, I started getting impatient, and hopping through the book, forlornly searching for any crumbs about the characters I had come to care about. The more I tried to read, the more I was forcibly reminded of the frequently hysterical remarks posted at Amazon about the later works of Robert Jordan (people mess with their hair, and walk around, and think about stuff, and nothing happens!)<br /><br />Well, stuff happens in DWD, most of it swathed in meandering plot lines that go here and there. Every now and then I was able to extract an entertaining nugget, but mostly I was bored, or irritated. I think this is Martin's revenge on all of us who fell in love with this series and harassed him to finish the book, George.  And yes, it's dark, and just plain lurid in parts, with little relief.  Reminds me of a 60 Minutes episode on a modern art, where a line of urinals and a pile of candy was considered \\"art\\". Or the painting that said \\"RAT, RAT, RAT\\" that sold for $30,000, I think. Too bad Martin IS a terrific writer, too bad I'll shell out for the next installment because I can't stand not to.  Rats, rats, rats.  It breaks my heart because I, like so many others, had waited for this volume for so long.<br /><br />I give it 3 stars because even this bloated meandering mass of spaghetti is better written than most of the fantasy out there - kudos to anyone who can read this word by word, but I thought James Joyce pulled a fast one on everyone, too.
B00006JU7T|5.0|Viewed: 6/05, 8/11<br />Rate: 9<br /><br />6/05: That is a great performance by Al Pacino. The story holds up well. However, it's not very complete. To watch Serpico is to see the fascination of the development of a character in Al Pacino. Also, Serpico is unique in combining authority and sub-culture in one person, and it works very well. I love the three parts about this film: the scene where Serpico explains his desire to be a cop, the moment when he finally gets the gold shield, and the final ending where I see him with a sheepdog and the closing statements. It is interesting to see him grow his beard and hair long while doing his job. All in all, Serpico is almost a near classic.<br /><br />8/11: When I think of Al Pacino, I think of Serpico. What a great performance. Unfortunately, the film isn't up to par as I hoped. The biggest drawback of it is the pacing. At times, it moves well, but much of it is very slow. If you look at the opening credits, especially the cast, you will notice that it only shows Al Pacino's name. That's it. The film is all Al Pacino as Frank Serpico. And that's one of the coolest on-screen characters I've ever seen. The hair, the clothes, the hats, the attitude and the whole get-up, I love it all. I also love the story, the hopelessness of it all, being defeated by the morass of the system. The ending is a classic. All in all, Serpico features the finest work in Al Pacino's career. I am raising the rating of Serpico from `8' to `9'.
044022425X|3.0|I loved the first three.  This is the first one I haven't been really impressed with.  It was a page turner and I didn't want to put it down, so she gets three stars.  But I agree that the characters of Brianna and Roger are not well developed and certainly not her best work.  And what really got to me was the storyline.  You expect bad things to happen in a book, but they need to be realistic.  Some of them were.  But most of the truly terrible things that happened were a result of the characters' own missteps, misunderstandings, and stupid decisions.  I felt like I was reading an episode of Three's Company, except it wasn't funny.  It was tragic.  It left a bad taste in my mouth.  I already ordered the next one but if it doesn't get better I am done with this series.

0823015033|5.0|Can an artist also be scientific in their explanations? Dewey can. While many others rely on vague descriptions, such as simply \\"start by rolling a pear-shaped ball\\", Dewey explains every step precisely, with pictures of how to place the clay in your hands to roll it and exactly how much clay will be used to make dolls in a variety of scales, i.e., 1/6 or 1/12 scale. She even gives pictures of different sized circles to indicate the size of the eyes needed depending on the scale of the doll you wish to make.<br /><br />Some readers reported finding her instructions difficult to comprehend. I found it to be quite the opposite. Everything, and I do mean everything, is spelled out in clear steps. No need to spend hundreds of dollars to get started, she teaches you how to make much of what you need.<br /><br />I had been looking at this book for years on Amazon, but didn't buy it until now. I mean, there is a picture of a doll with butterfly wings under the title: \\"Creating Lifelike Figures in Polymer Clay\\". How lifelike is a girl with wings? I didn't expect a seriously thought out book. I thought it would be a silly fairy book with simple information, which I didn't want. Instead I received extremely detailed information that will enable me to make the figures I choose. Even if you want to make cartoonish figures, there is still a great deal of information that can be gleaned from this comprehensive book. I am very impressed and did not expect to be.
0863077072|5.0|Who am I to review one of the greatest literary works of all time? Could I possibly give this book anything less than the maximum rating it so richly deserves? Should I even commence? Those were just some of my private thoughts as I finally put down a copy of this book - read. This is the book which stirred the American conscience, caused political reform and brought about change when first published in 1939. This is the book which described how families were starving to death because of corruption. This is John Steinbeck at his exceptional best. For those people who never got around to reading this engaging and absorbing account of the Joad family, may I suggest you actually purchase a copy (any copy!) and finally read it.<br /><br />Today the world is either in recession or emerging from the dark grip of this latest financial catastrophe. Whilst we may live in a time when millions of families are no longer allowed to starve to death - well, not in the developed world at any rate, I earnestly believe there are lessons to be learned from this book about the rich and powerful who care not for their fellow man but only for personal gain. More importantly, those lessons are as relevant today as they were in 1939.<br /><br />Another similarity also failed to escape my notice; In this book we see how US police and other officials use their positions of authority to threaten and even blackmail the many thousands of American migrants who were simply looking for work in order to feed hungry mouths. These people had not arrived from any foreign country and were not even black - something which would have made their persecution much easier. No!, these ordinary white American folk were honest farmers who had been forcibly evicted from their homes and the land they had worked for generations. Seventy years on, here in the UK, we are besieged by TV programmes depicting our different police forces undertaking their various duties around the country. Yet more cheaply produced \\"reality\\" television! Significantly, however, I have occasionally noticed how some police officers deliberately provoke a hostile situation where exists. Whilst not on the scale portrayed in this outstanding work, it is interesting that I should recognise that underlying attitude of arrogant superiority.<br /><br />Whilst some may find the book slow going at the start, Steinbeck quickly gathers in those loose strands until they suddenly pull together to assume a story, reveal a mental photograph and produce a relevance into which the reader becomes fully immersed. I promptly learned local words and understood the dialect in which they were spoken as the Joad story unfolded. I could hear those southern accents as hardships are endured and explained through the actions of those who lived them. This was the organised, legalised daylight robbery and exploitation of the poor by the rich who were actively supported by the law enforcement agencies. A week's work for 1,000 fruit pickers paying 50 cents an hour is advertised to 3,000 hungry people who then pass on the message. Consequently, 5,000 starving workers arrive in search of that employment. With so much competition, the rate is lowered to 30 cents - take it or leave it! It was a deliberate ploy repeated time after time. Anyone attempting to organise his fellow workers is photographed, black-listed and branded a communist. Now feed that to your children. Then the banks insist the farmers reduced the rate to 25 cents and any landowner who questions that decision is swiftly reminded of his own vulnerability as a mortgagee! In short, either you pay them 25 cents or you join them! My own immediate reaction was to recognise a similarity between then and now - specifically with those modern banking practises which preyed on the sub-prime market. Anyone who cared to consider precisely what \\"sub-prime\\" meant, knew it was a policy destined to fail. And fail it did in spectacular fashion - and yet, the fat cat bankers still draw bonuses based on \\"personal performance\\" and not on their company's overall profit or loss...<br /><br />I note from some of the comments appended to certain editions of this book, that various issues have been produced in which, apparently, Steinbeck's prose are changed to make the work an easier read. Please don't take the easy option, take the version written as it was intended to be read - i.e. the version written by Steinbeck. If not, you cannot claim to have read this book at all - instead you have the equivalent of, say, a Romeo and Juliet story - set in Manhattan in the 21st Century - and there are plenty of those...<br /><br />In closing, I would urge anyone (indeed everyone) who has not already read an original version of this book If to go out and buy a copy - any old copy and then simply read it. Having done that, you too will draw parallels with our modern age and understand what I mean. You will also be richer for having done so - as would those fat cats who, unfortunately, will probably never bother.

B003Y5H53S|2.0|I won't repeat a bunch of stuff about the movie's darkness, or heaviness. And I will give it credit for the best animated villain maybe ever in Jake the Rattlesnake. Maybe I'm offbase, but the thing I didn't care for was the blatant ripping off of a Western movie legend, both in appearance, and even in mimicking his voice. Spirit of the West, maybe, but use the real guy if you are gonna do it. They even referred to him as \\"The Man With No Name\\", with nary a mention of the guy's REAL name. Can't get much more blatant than that. Timothy who? The whole thing cheapens him too - I'm surprised he took the part.
B003X1OLDA|5.0|Well, this is my first Amazon review - strange really, considering the amount of music I have purchased from Amazon over the years, and all the reviews I've read that helped me purchase items.<br /><br />Well - what better way to start, than Camels Rainbows End - The Anthology 1973 - 1985.<br /><br />I'll keep it brief. Beautifully packaged (book style), 4 CD's and a very informative 38 page booklet with heaps of information on the band and some great pics. The remastering is excellent, cant fault it. The 4CD's are choc full of all that's best about Camel - including some rare and live studio stuff, mostly recorded for the BBC and of course Decca. Each CD contains approx 75 to 80 mins of playing time - just fantastic value. Oh yeh - and the price at the moment - WOW fantastic.<br /><br />If you're a Camel fan, or even a fan of prog rock -  then just buy it. You wont be disappointed.<br /><br />My one ongoing issue with Amazon though, is their poor packaging of items for their overseas markets. Although this item wasn't damaged as such, the protection offered for the box set was just insufficient for the rigors of overseas shipping. I hope Amazon will take note and try to improve their packaging.
0061784788|5.0|Pros:  This is certainly one of the best Rollins, perhaps the best.  He had me scurrying for Wikipedia to check out Damascus steel and volcanic activity in the 1700's.  Rollins is really great at coupling odd facts together to a point where you say \\"that's not true\\"....and then you start looking into it....and it is.  For technocrats,  Rollins dots his i's and crosses his t's.  No slop, no erroneous actions where you know stuff just doesn't operate that way.<br /><br />Cons:  I thought the time line was a little too compressed.  I doubt you can actually cover that much ground in the time period that Rollins alots to it.<br /><br />Bottom Line:  Rollins at his best and another addition to the Sigma Force series.  If you're not familiar with the Sigma Force series, then you need to go back to Sandstorm.
0062112430|4.0|My thoughts:  Delirium was a bit of a roller coaster ride for me. I started out really enjoying it, then I found myself really disliking Lena. After a while, she grew on me and I was able to enjoy her story but then the ending left me feeling unsatisfied. So many people have raved about this one but overall, it fell a little short for me.    The dystopian world that Lauren has created is great. Love, or rather, amor deliria nervosa  has been classified a disease. Science has found a cure but it can only be given to those over the age of 18. So, of course the helpless, uncured youth must be monitored at all times. They must learn of the dangers of amor deliria nervosa. It must be drilled into their heads until they are afraid to even look at a member of the opposite sex. Until they yearn for the cure.    Society as re-written itself. Fairy tales, great works of literature, even the Bible have been retold. I found this aspect of the story interesting. Love is such a basic human emotion and when you remove it, you're also removing emotional responses. People don't act or react to situation the same way. History and religion and science take on whole new meanings when feelings are removed. A pretty fascinating scenario.    Have to say, even with my wishy washy feelings for Lena, I was routing for her in the end. She really never knew what she was missing out on and after she sees the light so to speak, a whole new world opens up for her. I wanted her to experience that world and I was excited and afraid for her.  Forming an emotional connection to a character makes for a very enjoyable read.    The romance between Lena and Alex was a little predictable. I mean, he is the first boy she's had any extended contact with so yeah, she's going to fall for him. His reason's for falling for her though weren't as fleshed out. He likes her from the moment he sets eyes on her - not instant love but close.  So, their time together was enjoyable to read but not exactly surprising orexciting.    The ending though? A little to be desired. I didn't quite get why things played out the way they did - especially in the last few pages.  The cliff hanger and series fodder were a little frustrating. Not in the same way, but it reminded me a little like the ending of the movie Titanic. The 'why can't you make room for him on the raft' sort of feeling. Not logical or playing nice with the rules of   the storyline. Read it and see if you agree with me.    Will I pick up book 2? I will because, unlike most of the characters in Deliruim, I am emotionally involved. I very much want to know how Lena's story plays out.    A very well laid out dystopian tale. Likable characters, great plot line and even with the not so satisfying ending, I'm looking forward to the sequel. A book I would very much recommend to fans of YA dystopian romance.

1594744769|5.0|My thoughts:  First off, you need to hold this book in your hands. I know it must sound strange but this book has a particular feel to it. It's heavy and it's sleek and it just begs to be opened and read. And once you do? You won't be disappointed.  The picture on the cover is only the beginning. Inside there is so much visually to take in that I was never left wanting.    I have a lot of love for this book. I loved the characters, I loved the mystery, I loved the pictures and I loved the....now wait...don't want to give that little tidbit away.  Let's just say that there aren't too many authors, in my opinion, that can pull off the supernatural elements that Ransom Riggs did and still keep the story real and believable. Did I mention how much I loved this book!?    The story itself is unique and boarders on the fantastical. Even before we are given a firm grasp on who and what exactly Miss Peregrine's children are there are a lot of pieces to the puzzle that we, as readers, need to put in their places. But that's the fun of it. I loved collecting all these pieces and I couldn't wait to see how they all fit together.    And that's another reason why I loved this book - all the pieces do fit together. They work with the story and I wasn't left hanging. There is more to this story to tell - I don't think we could ever know absolutely everything there is to know about these children and the world they live in. But, as a reader, I'm looking forward to more story instead of dreading it.    I'm still not sure if Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children will be a series but if there is a book 2 it will be because there needs to be a book 2. So many YA books these days are series books because series books sell. That may be the case but if Ransom writes books 2, I'm pretty sure it's going to be because he doesn't have a choice. These peculiar children will not be silenced.    Unlike any other YA paranormal / fantasy / fiction book out there. Hard to put down and visuallystunning - you will not be disappointed with this book! So far, my favorite read of 2011.    Acquisition: Received a free copy for review
B004Q7E0TA|4.0|Portia tells her story in a very captivating and powerful way in this book. I feel that it gives you great insight into not only her life but into the lives of many others who may be struggling to fit the \\"hollywood image\\" in terms of weight and/or sexuality expectations. Although this is, by no means, a self-help book it does paint the picture of the expectations that exist in American society and how these can take a toll on an individual.<br /><br />The story of Ellen and Portia and how they came to be is also exhibited in the text and I found it to be very inspiring, adding to the sincerity and realness of the book.<br /><br />It's an easy read and I would recommend it to anyone who is remotely interested!!
B005D9MUWY|4.0|This application is very useful for everday communication. It&apos;s almost as if it can read your mind.  Two issues, one major and another an annoying bug, make me stop short of recommending it to my friends. First, despite the fact that my phone is one of the fastest available with a gig of ram and a dual core processor,  the keyboard often causes lag and e. en an occasional force close. The other thing that bothers me is that,  upon opening my keyboard, the suggestion pane pops up regardless of what I am doing, even in games and video editing where it really is unnecessary and gets in the way.
B002VPE1WK|5.0|This is really the perfect size for carrying my photo gear around.  It is easy to move around the compartments to better fit my gear.  It also has plenty of small pockets for the tinier stuff.  I fit 2 camera bodies, 2 lenses, an external flash, extra batteries, memory cards, and extra accessories.    It was very affordable and is perfect for my purposes! Love it!
B00003CXSM|1.0|At no point in this film did I think I was seeing anything of real life and real people.  Every minute I was instead conscious a script was being acted out.  Nothing about the characters, or the story line, was logical and as the film progressed I realized it was like watching endless piece of a puzzle but in no way did the pieces fit together into a picture.  There was no sense in the dialogue of people really talking either, just of actors doing their best with the lines handed to them.  The musical score labors mightily start to finish to signal cuteness but there's little cute in the dialogue or the storyline; it's a mess.  Jennifer Lopez is an actress with a small, small range and a flatness to her performances because, I suspect, that's the best she can do within this framework.  She obviously has been directed here within an inch of her life, but there's little continum to her performance from scene to scene.  This was a big hit so obviously the public liked it and the stars do have large followings.  Whadda I know?

B002MQYOFW|5.0|Even though this is an Young Adult series, I (45 years old) thoroughly enjoyed it and could not put it down until I had read all 3 books.  It is a dark story and a bit depressing at times, but it is definitely thought provoking and entertaining.
B001R4MEYS|4.0|What an awesomely well done album, from the cover art to the very last song, it's all crafty and trippy at the same time. The vocals improved, I know this because they gave me goosebumps for the first time. I loved it.
0439023513|1.0|The first book was excellent because of the depth of well developed characters who drove the plot.    The second book was good, but you could tell the plot was starting to take over    The third book....well, here's what you get for characters    1. People too physically and mentally broken to continue  2. Corrupt people in a lust for power  3. Likable people who die pointlessly and without detail or emotion    and the plot isn't that great. Predominantly, it's hospital rooms, crying, and fake promotional war footage. What's happening with the real war? God only knows, it's not like it's driven by the main characters. But, you understand by reading the book, it's cruel and pointless and lots of people die for no reason apparently...oh yeah, and there's a half-baked happy ending tacked on so that message doesn't make you want to give up all hope for humanity and jump out of a window...
B000093BDX|5.0|While I caution against any buyers believing that one CD is able to capture all of the genius of the Beach Boys, this compilation sure makes for one hell of a listen.  How could I rank a compilation that includes \\"God Only Knows,\\" \\"Don't Worry Baby,\\" and \\"Good Vibrations\\" any lower than 5 stars?  Brian Wilson was one of God's greatest gifts to music, and this compilation glows with his brilliance.  From their early, memorable surfing hits to their melancholic Pet Sounds tracks, each song showcases the rare talents that precious few have demonstrated in the history of popular music.    This is not to say that the CD does not have its faults.  Had it been up to me, there are certainly some other songs that I would have lobbied to include on this compilation, (\\"Please Let Me Wonder,\\" \\"The Warmth of the Sun,\\" and \\"You Still Believe in Me\\" are just a few examples that come to mind).  But as I mentioned previously, any single CD set of Beach Boys tracks is going to be missing some absolute gems.  There is also some controversy as to the particular audio mixes that have been or should have been included on this CD.  This, unfortunately, is a controversy that will likely remain unresolved due to Brian Wilson's affinity for mono, a preference that few relate to in the new millennium.  I must admit, I am partial to the new stereo mixes of the Pet Sounds album (an album that was originally recorded in mono), but I am also not one to think that the mono versions cannot be equally enjoyable.  Rest assured, the audio on the Sounds of Summer is definitely superior to the audio on the Good Vibrations Box Set.    In the end, this CD highlights some glorious moments of an incredible band's amazing career.  Highly recommended for those who are just now discovering the Beach Boys.  But please, if you choose not to purchase any other of their albums, don't let it be because you didn't take the time to look.  This is just the tip of a very large and excellent iceberg.
0765365278|5.0|This book will pull you in and leave you wanting more. The world is detailed, imaginative and coherent, and the story is captivating. The only negative is that the dialogue is a little stilted at times, but the interwoven plotlines and backstories make the characters compelling nonetheless. Can't wait for the next installment!
B004EPZ07U|4.0|Was sort of itching to write a quick review (of the movie only at this point). First off, this film took way, way more abuse than it deserved when in theaters! Judging by most of the reviews I read, I thought my eyeballs were going to burn out of my skull if I dared to view it! Anyway, I did think the writers and director made some unfortunate choices in what story to tell and in how to portray the character of Hal Jordan, and I think that those mistakes hurt the film to a large extent, but by no means made it into a terrible movie.  To be a little more specific, they made Hal Jordan to be a much sadder, less confident person than he should have been for a big-budget, summer film that they were hoping would become a solid franchise. Hal was portrayed as too much of a screw-up who, after being given this absolutely incredible gift and responsibility of the power ring, quickly gives up and goes home after being roughed up a little in training. Crazy! That should have been the moment when he said to himself, \\"Finally! I have a way to do something fantastic with my life!\\" He should have been more of a shot-in-the-arm for the Green Lantern Corps, not someone who comes across as something of a quitter. That being said, I thought Ryan Reynolds was perfectly cast as Hal and certainly did what was asked of him in the film. Its just that I feel the writers/director made some bad choices for him.  I understand that they approached it as though Hal felt he failed to live up to his father because Hal felt fear and he believed his father did not, but that seemed a sort of flimsy reason to cripple him with self-doubt for most of the movie. It seemed that Hector Hammond was in the film to show another variation on how a father can effect his son's mental health and confidence, but to tell you the truth, I didn't enjoy being distracted by another emotionally damaged character when I wanted to see an excited Hal Jordan on an incredible first adventure with the Corps. Plus the mutatedHammond sort of turned my stomach a little too much. Gross! And again, the actor portraying him did an excellent job, its just that the way he was written distracted from what was cool and exciting.  And I thought Blake Lively took way too much abuse as well. She was perfectly cast, looks very much like Carol Farris, was smokin' hot and her acting was perfectly fine. What was the problem? And she'd have made a great Star Sapphire, too.  I really enjoyed the end fight with Parallax. I thought the FX looked great and they did a fine job of showing how cool it is to wield one of the rings. I thought it was great seeing Green Lantern streak off into space with that gigantic beasty chasing him. Just the scale of it was exciting. And though it might have been a little goofy, I loved the way they had Hal use a giant fist to punch Parallax into the sun. You gotta smile at something like that!  I should mention the helicopter action scene quickly. It just seemed a little silly to me how long it took that damn thing to come down! I mean it seemed to be spinning around out of control for ten minutes while people ran in circles screaming, and then another five minutes rolling around in Hal's hot wheels track before it crashed! Just GRAB the frikkin' thing already! hah. But anyway, even THAT scene didn't bother me all that much. It was just goofy.  So to wrap this short review up: Green Lantern was a quite flawed but very fun movie, full of excellent characters and a huge, NEW universe to explore. I REALLY hope they don't give up on a sequel, its really such a great story with limitless potential. And one last thing, the casting of Mark Strong, his portrayal of Sinestro and the look of the character were all perfection. We GOTS to see him again!  (October 28 Update) Just an add-on regarding the blu-ray of Green Lantern. The good news is that I think it looks and sounds GREAT! I can't agree with the criticisms of the picture quality. Also, I thought the CGI suits for the Lanterns worked perfectly and were a good idea. The bad news is that this movie must have some kind of curse on it! Somehow they decided that there would be no Bookmark option on the disc! Of all the many blu-rays I own, THIS is the one that most needs viewer-chosen bookmarks to allow you to skip over the parts that just don't work, and get right to the parts that are actually pretty cool. Also, they chose to use some murky black and white printing on the discs themselves. They look terrible. Finally, I do have to agree that the ultraviolet/flixster digital copy is a pain. Maybe they're ahead of their time on that (since there are some interesting options online, and if I could actually access it from my tv rather than my computer, it might be useable), but the iTunes digital copies (included on disc, NOT downloaded) are much better. I'll be steering clear of the ultraviolet copies in future. I'd still LOVE to see a sequel to Green Lantern, though. Great characters and potential.

B00479SVBU|4.0|I bought this Satechi mp3 player since there was a short in my old one (not by Satechi). It is easy to hook-up. I opened the package and was listening to my ipod tunes within 5 minutes. I keep it on one station, which is the same station I had my old player tuned to. My only issue is that the sound gets distorted when the volume on my ipod is turned up high. I have to have my ipod on medium volume and control the volume on my actual car stereo to my preference. I guess if I transfer everything onto a SD card, the sound quality may be better. I am still in the process of purchasing one. All in all it is a good mp3 player and I am happy with my purchase. Anything to not have to listen to the bland radio stations ;D

B004A8ZWVK|5.0|Now we see this film wins award nominations aplenty. Biggest winner was the public. Leads of Davis and Spencer that stole the spotlight. DVD to own, not rent.<br />The only drawback with the DVD is the sparse bonus material. 4 min. of 2 deleted, and a 5 min. music video of one of the film's songs. Pathetically weak bonus, but then it is a 5.5 star film. Everyone asks to borrow our copy, I should have bought 2.<br />Oh yes, there are SUBTITLES.<br /><br />We attended the opening matinee; we'll view it again, that good. Is `The Help' the soul of 60s era race relations? This worthy film based on Kathryn Stockett's #1 best-seller is equally a first-class view as true for the read. The story of 3 daring Mississippi women is as absorbing as any you'll see this year. The plot is writing a book which attempts to tell the truth about B/W relations in the city of Jackson, between wealthy whites and `the help'; but doing it anonymously. Without being fired or lynched.<br /><br />There is humor in the way the Jackson Belle socialites operate, and eventually react to the book publication. Bryce Dallas Howard is the personification of Bad Girl, Hilly. Although beautiful, I loathed Hilly in the film and book, as you are supposed to. And Jessica Chastain (Murder on the Orient Express) has all it takes to be the scene stealer while playing Celia. Truly believable!<br />Humor erupts in how the help secretly reacts to their treatment. There's sadness at some injustice.<br />Viola Davis plays a slimmer/sexier Aibileen than was my mental image while reading the book. Octavia Spencer is right on as Minny. Both girls pack their roles with perfection.<br />The film has intrigue through the months of secret interviews.<br />There's a mystery related to Skeeter's (Emma Stone) own childhood maid's story, which is a larger part of the story in the book.<br />Skeeter, Aibileen, & Minny are the key book writers. The casting is near perfection. Should be some Oscar nominations someplace.<br />Some other stars too, like, Sissy Spacek, Cicely Tyson, & Mary Steenburgen (Proposal, Joan of Arcadia).<br /><br />I remember reading the book and doing it as quickly as possible toward the end; and praying that all the `help' have a happy ending, but expecting some casualties. With the movie, it is evident when the story is climaxing, and then you just wish that you could make it last another hour or two. An excellent story, but then we all knew that from the book.<br />It is a tribute to the story that you forget it is fiction. How much is real, a docu-drama of the early 1960's of the south (& north)? We need reviews from the real-life `help' of the early 60's. Only they know!<br /><br />If you view only one film this year...this should be it. See it soon, & as the film's dialogue states, \\"Before the whole civil rights thing blows over.\\" That line brought a theater audience LOL.<br />As Aibileen believes, quoted from the book, \\"We done something brave and good here. And Minny, maybe she don't want a be deprived a any a the things that go along with being brave and good.\\"<br /><br />`& Mary Steenburgen (Proposal, Joan of Arcadia).

B0050PYNOY|4.0|It looks like a good number of the people who gave this a low score went into this movie expecting something on par with Lord Of The Rings. Seriously? The main star is Danny McBride - right off the bat you should know that this is going to be a crude, stupid, medieval, rendition of the highly rated Eastbound and Down.<br /><br />Personally, I loved it! It had my brothers and I laughing hysterically through several of the scenes. There is no reason that this movie should be rated less than 4 stars. I found it to be much funnier than Robin Hood: Men In Tights. Albeit, much raunchier and crass.
B0050PYNO4|3.0|This documentary details the true story of the alien captured and held in Roswell, New Mexico. A heart-wrenching tale of imprisonment, prejudice and the human capacity for compassion and generosity. Seth Rogen peels off his human shell and for the first time we see him in his natural state, a beautiful, wide-eyed extraterrestrial who selflessly contributed true facts to Spielberg's alien masterpieces. Of course they had to make it a happy ending, and the galactic imprisonment as a sex slave of Blythe Danner's character is not addressed, but still under investigation by the NSA.

B00192IV0O|2.0|As a music fan, I feel that I must be fair; the Black Eyed Peas are far from the worst act in musical history. I'm willing to accept their die-hard fans, and will try to give perspective to those deriding them as the worst thing ever to happen to music. However, THE E.N.D. forces me to recommend something I despise; simply download the song \\"I Gotta Feeling\\", and leave the rest be. I've always advocated the purchase of CDs, and view the MP3 craze as silly. Sadly, this album proves that said craze has effected the way musicians view their craft. THE E.N.D. is built off of \\"I Gotta Feeling\\", with every other song ranging from mediocre, to downright un-listenable.
B005C9YZIW|5.0|There's not too much detail in the product description at the moment, so I thought I'd add some info as I am eagerly anticipating the release of this Blu-ray. Obviously I don't have the product yet, but my rating reflects what I am expecting it to deliver.    Bottom line, this should be the definitive version of the incredible \\"Planet Earth\\" documentary. It will have everything the 2007 Blu-ray was missing, and then some. To wit:    * 6 Blu-ray discs, with the 11 regular episodes plus 6.5 hours of bonus content  * 110 minutes of the behind-the-scenes video diaries (10 minutes per episode)  * \\"Planet Earth - The Future\\" three-part series  * Another behind-the-scenes extra with greatest moments from the series  * Three bonus episodes: \\"Snow Leopard,\\" \\"Secrets of the Maya Underworld,\\" and \\"Elephant Nomads of the Namib Desert\\"  * Commentary on select episodes  * Option to turn off narration    In short, I can't wait for this release. It should address all the (valid) criticisms of the 2007 Blu-ray.
1439133948|4.0|Cryoburn is the long-awaited new novel in Lois McMaster Bujold's excellent VORKOSIGAN SAGA, following 2002's Diplomatic Immunity. If you're not familiar with this series yet and are in the mood for some intelligent, character-driven and consistently entertaining SF, drop everything now and go find the first few books. Almost all of them are conveniently available in affordable omnibus editions from Baen. You can start with the Cordelia's Honor omnibus if you want to read the series according to internal chronological order, or Young Miles if you want to start where Miles Vorkosigan, the series' unforgettable hero, really gets into gear.    In Cryoburn, Miles is on Kidou-daini (a brand new planet in the series, as far as I know) to investigate a possible scam involving cryogenically frozen people. As the novel starts off, he has just narrowly escaped becoming a hostage during an attack at a cryonics conference and is wandering around in a drugged haze, because he happens to be allergic to the drug used by his would-be kidnappers. By the time the (very amusing) hallucinations wear off, he finds himself in an underground cryonics clinic, taken under the wing of a young boy who has recently run away from home. Eventually, Miles finds his way back to the local Barrayaran consulate, and begins to unravel a mystery that leads much, much farther than anyone originally suspected...    Cryoburn shows Miles in his Imperial Auditor role, investigating a mystery in the name of Emperor Gregor, but as he isn't actually on Barrayar, his powers are more limited than they would be on his home planet. Still, in typical Miles fashion he quickly pulls the local consular staff along in his wake as he investigates and solves the mystery through legal, quasi-legal and, well, uniquely Milesian methods. As always, there's lots of action, a good amount of humor, and Bujold's consistently excellent dialogues. It's hard to be bored, reading a Miles Vorkosigan novel.    By now, a narrative infused with Miles' manic energy will be more or less expected by long-time readers, but as a special treat, Cryoburn alternates viewpoints from Miles to Jin, the boy he meets at the cryonics clinic, and (best of all) Miles' Armsman, Roic. Roic is a sturdy, calm fellow who sounds as if he is used to his master's antics by now. It really can't be a coincidence that his name rhymes with `stoic'. Seeing Miles through Roic's eyes is the best part of this novel.    In a nutshell, Cryoburn is a good installment in a great series. I doubt that many long-time fans of the VORKOSIGAN SAGA would consider this one of the best entries in the series, but expecting that would put the bar almost impossibly high. The plot also doesn't really advance the overall story arc of the series much, and instead reads as if it could be one of five or ten other missions Miles completed in the same year. However, the end of the novel, which is unconnected to the mission, suddenly and painfully yanks you back into the main continuity of the series, and will have you clamoring for the next book. Since it's been almost 10 years since the last Miles book, hopefully this will motivate some new readers to get into the VORKOSIGAN SAGA, which is easily one of the best SF series of the last few decades.
1594744769|5.0|I've heard a lot of buzz about this book and decided to give it a go.  And as you know, a long bus/train ride is my favorite place to read.  As I rolled into Los Angeles, I was midway through.  The reviews that I've read are pretty much split in the middle.  Some loved it and some thought it was not that good.  I loved it.  In fact, I've placed it in my \\"Favorites\\" pile.  Sure, it wasn't perfect but I thought it was a very, VERY good read.<br /><br />My favorite part of the whole book were the illustrations.  According to the author, they are real found snapshots and the story was written around it.  I am totally in love with that idea.  The pictures the author used were haunting and creepy, and it totally added to the sheer beauty of the piece.  The story has random popular culture references, either directly or indirectly.  Doctor Who, rap music, Groundhog Day, Lord of the Flies, Peter Pan, even Jeffrey Dahmer...<br /><br />The book really sucks you in.  It does get a little tedious towards the middle but it was a necessary evil, methinks.  Even though the book has referenced some previous work, it was very original.  I liked the mixing of fact and fiction to create a new world.<br /><br />What I did not like so much, as with the majority of the YA books that I read, was the \\"teen romance\\" aspect.  Frankly, I was a bit freaked out.  I understand why it had to be there but gladly, there wasn't much of it.  Also, the characters were not well developed.  I can tell what makes them peculiar but almost nothing on their personalities.  Even the ages of the peculiar kids were not clearly stated so it was kind of difficult for me to picture some of the scenes.  Was 16-year-old Jacob talking to a small child or someone who was in the same age bracket?  However, I do hope the author works on character development if there will be a sequel.  The author CANNOT leave it at that!<br /><br />Here and there, I can see the effort of the author to make Jacob sound like your typical YA hero - being hormonal, indecisive, jaded.  In some parts, he loses that teenage angst tone.  I actually like that.  I believe that Jacob being 16 is the only thing tying this book to the YA genre.  It can easily be a children's book (along the lines of Harry Potter) or a contemporary adult piece.  Readers across all ages will surely enjoy this.<br /><br />Rating: 5/5.<br /><br />Recommendation: I want all of you to read it!  Read it aloud to your children.  This is definitely an adventure.ndecisive, jaded.  In some parts, he loses that teenage angst tone.  I actually like that.

1594481717|3.0|I came across this book at the local dollar bookstore, where  for one buck, it seems hard to ever go wrong.     The premise of the book is that, to survive in the \\"conceptual age\\",  \\"left-brain\\" thinking/analysis is not sufficient, and that the most successful  people will be those who better use their right hemispheres. The author cites three  reasons for this shift to the right brain: automation and Asia (left brain rule-based tasks  are now being performed by both computers and cheaper white-collar Asian workers), and   abundance (there is more need than ever for inventors and designers).     Although there are some partial truths to his observations, in general I find this outlook a bit shallow  and myopic in perspective.    For one, the author seems to believe that this pipeline of cheap foreign labor will last forever. But we have to   remember that the US exports both knowledge and culture in enormous quantities (for example, the majority  of students who enroll in my computer-science graduate courses are from other countries;   especially China and India), and   these exports spurn more industry abroad which will have the effect of improving the quality of life abroad;  and hence driving up labor costs in those countries.    Secondly, ALL human intelligence is subject to automation, or at least an attempt to automate.   For example, playing chess requires a combination of mathematical-logical, spatial, and what the author refers to as \\"symphonic\\" intelligence. Many chess players think of themselves as artists. And many artists are inspired by  the game of chess.    Rather than limit oneself to the six right-brain skill areas identified in the book (design, story, symphony,  empathy, play, and meaning), all of which are to supposedly save us from losing our jobs, I prefer  Harvard University professor Howard Gardener's multiple intelligences; and advocate the development of all of them  to fully experience the best of what humanity has to offer. The intelligences are  1. Spatial: spatial judgment and the ability to develop novel internal images within the mind     Exercises: visiting museums, playing video games, studying geometry, designing, drawing, sculpting  2. Linguistic: the ability to use words, spoken or written     Exercises: writing a story, essay, or poetry, public speaking, reading books of all types, learning a      foreign language, acting  3. Logical-mathematical: the ability to reason, think abstractly, and have number sense.     Exercises: studying science, mathematics, and philosophy, computer programming, solving puzzles  4. Bodily-Kinesthetic: the ability to navigate within the physical world     Exercises: sports, yoga, walking, running, biking, weight lifting, dancing  5. Musical: the ability to play and appreciate music     Exercises: learning to play an instrument, listening to instrumental and orchestral music, writing a      musical composition, singing  6. Interpersonal: the ability to interact, communicate and empathize with others     Exercises: studying the art of listening; socializing, play acting  7. Intrapersonal: the ability to understand oneself, and reflect on oneself; understanding one's own needs,     personal strengths, and weaknesses.     Exercises: going for a quite walk, sitting in complete silence, meditating, keeping a journal  8. Naturalistic: the ability to relate to and observe one's natural surroundings     Exercises: going for a walk in a nature park, observing nature (birds, plants, flowers, butterflies, etc.)    For example, what the author calls \\"story telling\\", falls into linguistic, interpersonal, and intrapersonal.  Symphony falls within musical, spatial, intrapersonal, and possibly even naturalistic. And \\"play\\" can fall into  any number of these intelligences.     By the way, if there is an age in which we are entering, I would call it the \\"ubiquitous intelligence\\" age, in which  our personal, social, and work environments are filled with intelligent agents that help us lead more   productive, satisfying, and meaningful lives. The UA age will require us to harness all of the above intelligences  with the help of technology. And, like the conceptual age, it will require many more inventors and designers than  exist today. That is one message of the book that I do agree with. Many of these new designers and inventors will  come from the US, and many more will come from Asia, as that continent begins to further adopt western culture  and technology.     In conclusion, the book did offer some interesting ideas on how to enhance work through storytelling, empathy, design, humor,   games, and finding meaning; and it did provide some good exercises for developing these traits. It seems hard to disagree that  these traits can enrich one's life and the workplace. However, if I had to give advice to someone on how to maintain their  marketability in a fast-changing world, for starters I would suggest that each day one attempt to learn something new about  his or her chosen field. Also, keep a current view of the forest, but also force yourself to learn new things that   seem challenging and move you out of your \\"comfort zone\\".  One new piece of information or added skill can make a world of difference in one's outlook and potential.   In the end each person is his or her own employer.

B003A4IFGY|3.0|At this stage in his career, Petty is obviously willing to explore new (for him) genres of music, and this album is quite a departure from the usual soft-rock/heavy rock.  While the instrumentals are superb, I don't think Tom has a \\"Blues\\" voice. Maybe it's the pitch, which seems a bit too high, but it sounds kind of like a nasal whine rather than a soulful, rich, blues voice. So, for that reason, his blues stuff just doesn't make the grade for me. I'll give him credit for trying something new, but it is too far removed from his signature sound for me.
B003NX76BM|5.0|As a cat lover I was interested in the comments about the dog training in the book being a distraction.  I don't agree, I think the training details helped bring out the personalities of the characters and lead to explanations as to why they act as they do in the story.  In addition they were well researched and even funny most of the time.  I now realize that the dog owners in my area are the problem, not their dogs. The owners need to go to obedience school!     Good thriller.  Fast moving story without losing the romance or shortening the story line. Parts of the story were a little too predictable but not everything can be unique, I guess.  I liked the very human interaction between the primary couple.  It shows that strong relationships can build on shaky ground and that human frailty is part of a relationship.  They meshed and became stronger as a result.

She played six of these songs live and the 'soldiers angel' was quite a emotional one for the crowd. How many songs say it so well about soldiers who give all for us? The other songs were all pretty good. I don't understand the one star reviews on this one. This is a well crafted cd with lots of great songs on it. Perhaps none of them have the bite of her early work guitar wise but they are not bad in the least. In fact they sound pretty good. Stevie has had over 40 top fifty hits. And surely soldiers angel deserves this honor too.  There isn't a bad song on here imo. The sound is fine. And of course with all artists you get a few one star reviews. But these are undeserved on this one.
6303444202|4.0|This production of Meridith Willson's \\"The Music Man\\" is a treasure, marred only slightly by the weak, wobbly singing of Shirley Jones. How that woman achieved a successful career in the movies and TV (Partridge Family series) with a voice like hers is beyond belief. Nevertheless, Robert Preston, Buddy Hackett and Ron Howard make this a real toe-tapping hum-along feel-good experience. Buy it, rent it, play it again and again!

0385341008|5.0|I first noticed this book in Barnes and Noble one day many years ago.  I thought it was an interesting title and in fact, it was interesting enough to make me pick it up and glance at it.  I think I almost bought it and had to put it down in order to purchase another book.  Fast forward a few years, and several of my friends have read and recommended this book to me but I always left it in the back of my priority list because it just didn't seem very exciting to me.  Fast forward again and one of my favorite friends on Goodreads recommended the book to me but in audio form.  I was really intrigued with the idea of listening to an audio book and I asked what the best audio book was.  In response, my friend urged me to get the audio of this book and to listen to it.  Fast forward again to just a few weeks ago and lo and behold, I found it at my library and due to the wonders of having a Nook (not a Kindle, but a Nook, because if I had a Kindle, I wouldn't be able to write this) I was able to download and listen to Guernsey in like 10 minutes time and that was only because I had to install some software that I didn't already have installed.  So that's how I came to listen to this book rather than read it.<br /><br />Also, before I get into my review, in preparation to write it, as I always do, I read other reviewers opinions.  I was completely shocked to see that there were quite a few negative reviews on this book.  I tell you, I was shocked.  Most of the reviews I read cited a poor and unbelievable plot.  So I will address those complaints in my review rather than go over why this is such an amazing book.<br /><br />Listening to this book was a real treat.  It was almost like watching a play.  The artists that read their parts were delightful and I find myself speaking with a British accent even though I am a Valley Girl.  The artists took me away to this time period and I could smell the salt air and hear the seagulls.  You know why?  Because I have an imagination and that's what this author asked you to do.  Just to relax and enjoy and use your imagination and go somewhere FUN for a change.  Quit reading about vampire teenagers and hard ass chick paranormal slayers.  If you do, if you can take the stick out of your ass and just ENJOY something for once, you will be pleased and rewarded.  I didn't just like this.  I LOVED it.  It is well worth the purchase of an audio version which is what I will be doing because this is something I will want to listen to again and again and again.  I don't think I'd ever want to read it though because it was just so perfect on audio.<br /><br />Thank you to my friend Jennifer for recommending such a delightful and wonderful piece of journalistic joy.<br /><br />What I liked:  I loved, no, I ADORED the little bits of humor thrown in here and there that made me seriously stop and laugh.  Real belly laughs.  This is a love story of sorts and yet my favorite part about the book wasn't the love story, but the people around the love story.<br /><br />What I disliked:  I dislike that these people aren't real.  I want to go and visit them and have a cup of tea and exchange recipes and books and some genuine life shares.his author asked you to do.

B004EPYZPI|3.0|The Lincoln Lawyer was a pleasant way to spend a couple of hours. Not your typical lawyer movie because more time was spent on how the main character conducted his business and less time in the courtroom. The acting was fine, the script was fine, and there were a few surprises. No Academy Awards for this movie. I would rent this movie before investing any money on a movie you may not desire to watch more than once. At the very least, buy the DVD instead of the Blu-ray because there is no reason for HD.
B001BW02B8|3.0|Its albums like this that make me regret paying for digital music. There's about two or three songs that are any good (out of 15?).  After listening for a few days in my car I am already tired of it (juxtaposed 'songs about jane' which I still like to listen to)
B0051BVQFG|1.0|I thought that this movie would be something on the order of Independence Day, but I was so wrong. This movie is basically designed for the mentality of a RPG game player - Shoot, Shoot, Shoot and hope you hit something. There was no plot or character development and the viewer has no reason to become invested in the movie. To make the viewing experience even worse, the camera switches angles continuously causing something akin to motion sickness. Save your money!
B004FGMDOQ|2.0|Starts out well, but as the pages dwindle down, you'll find yourself wondering, \\"How is this going to get resolved in just a few more pages?\\"      The answer: IT DOESN'T!  This is nothing more than a set-up for a sequel. Very disappointing.
0553801473|1.0|Many previous reviews have addressed my thoughts on this book (nothing happens, all our favorite characters somehow became annoying and stupid, etc. etc.), so I don't really have anything new to add. However, I remember seeing a review for AFFC where the reviewer laid out a \\"reading plan\\" to get the gist of the story without having to read every single tedious chapter, and I thought it might be helpful to have one for ADWD. So, if you want your dose of Westeros but, like me, you value your time and don't want to read 1000 pages of medieval menus, turtle ecology, and the same phrases repeated ad nauseum, here is my suggested plan for getting enough of the story to satisfy your ASOIAF cravings without wading through all the tripe. Then go to Wikipedia for the rest.<br /><br />Fully read:<br />Theon/Reek - his storyline isn't hugely important, but it's probably one of the most interesting in and of itself.<br />Cersei - she only has two chapters, but they're pretty satisfying<br />Bran - not much happens, but his chapters have interesting insight and backstory into the mythology of Westeros<br /><br />Partially read:<br />Jon Snow - read his first chapter; he pulls off some major badassery there, but then proceeds to do nothing at all for the rest of the book.<br />Daenerys - read her very first and last two chapters, and I'll fill in the rest right now: she marries someone we don't care about, but wishes she married someone else we don't care about, then she sits on a throne and jiggles her foot impatiently. Oh, and there are lots of people around, all with names like Zhogzag mo Bushka and all completely lacking in personality.<br />Tyrion - read three of his chapters. Any three. Seriously, it doesn't matter which (although I would recommend his earlier chapters over the later ones). His character is more tedious than amusing in this book, and three chapters should be enough of him to satisfy all but the most hardcore Tyrion fans. Yes, there are some important revelations you might miss, but honestly, they were so poorly executed that you'll get the same emotional impact if you read about them on Wikipedia instead of in Martin's own words.<br /><br />Skip:<br />Dorne/Martell storylines - To be honest, I skipped them, so I can't really say if anything is wrong with them. All I know is I skipped them and read the summary online, and I don't regret it.<br />Victarion Greyjoy - I skipped these too. I just never got into the ironborn storylines.<br />Jaime - he only has one chapter, and there is only one paragraph of important stuff, which ends with a sort of cliffhanger, so it's really not even worth reading when you only get a few tantalizing bites and are left wanting more.<br />Davos - I'm probably out of the mainstream on this, because apparently a lot of people like him, but I've always found his character boring, and his story drags here (well, like everything else in this book). Although I don't remember wanting to claw my eyes out while reading his chapters (like I did with Dany's), so they might be satisfactory for Davos fans.<br />Arya - I hate putting her down here, because I love her character, but nothing really *happens* in her story. But she only has two chapters, so if you're a big Arya fan, go ahead and read her chapters, they're not awful.<br />Barristan, Griff, Melisandre - I think they each have one chapter, and since they are all new POVs, it's not worth trying to get invested in these new people when it's only for one chapter.<br /><br />I'm sure a lot of people will disagree with the chapters I've chosen to read and/or skip, which is fine. This is just my personal taste.

B002ZG983M|5.0|\\"How come nobody's ever tried to be a superhero (Kick-Ass)?\\"  When Dave Lizewski (Aaron Johnson) utters that line, I am instantly hooked.  I tried to be a superhero in high school by defending those who could not defend themselves, but I never had a costume or cool alias.  Kick-Ass (a.k.a. Dave Lizewski) is a teenage vigilante who becomes an internet sensation as a masked superhero.  His crusade attracts the attention of Hit-Girl (Chloe Moretz) and Big-Daddy (Nicholas Cage) who join forces to fight the powerful gangster, Frank D'Amico (Mark Strong).<br /><br />This is a fast-paced, action-packed film that is a visual feast for the eyes with colorful costumes and brilliantly choreographed fight scenes.  The grotesquely violent scenes are portrayed in a satirical manner making them quite enjoyable to watch.  The music selection is an essential component by adding impact to high-voltage action scenes as well as depth to emotional scenes.<br /><br />An eclectic cast of characters adds to the film's appeal because they are relatable and enviable.  Hit-Girl (a.k.a., Mindy Macready) is absolutely the best part of this movie.  She is a pint-sized, powerful avenger who slings guns, knives and vulgarity with ease.  All of this is done under the watchful eye of her doting father, Big-Daddy (a.k.a. Damon Macready).  The relationship between Mindy and her father is heartwarming, albeit unconventional.  There is something endearing and disturbingly funny about a little girl whose daddy teaches her how to take a bullet in the chest.<br /><br />Despite all the blood and violence there are some touching moments.  This is a film about finding your true identity, breaking out of your comfort zone and taking extreme risk to earn great rewards.  Kick-Ass is a cult classic that will have devoted fans for decades.  I am definitely one of them!<br /><br />Kick-Ass. Dir. Matthew Vaughn. Perf. Aaron Johnson, Nicolas Cage and Chloe Moretz. Marv Films: 2010, Film.
B004XE0TDW|5.0|I have two copies of this album, which i rarely do with records. One to play and one to keep, just so i can listen to it for ever and ever.
B004HO6I4M|4.0|I want to go to Rio de Janeiro!  Rio is an exuberant CGI animated 3D film with wonderfully vibrant colors that literally jump off the screen.  This is a classic fish out of water story filled with romance, life lessons and a fairly predictable ending.  Nevertheless, Rio is a truly enjoyable film and nearly impossible to watch without dancing in your seat.  Director Carlos Saldanha incorporates a tremendous amount of the Brazilian culture into the film and realistic landscape; it is very easy to forget this is an animation.  In particular, the flight scenes offer spectacular bird's eye views of the exotic Rio de Janeiro setting.  Breathtaking scenery filled with rich, warm colors is incredibly detailed and mesmerizing.<br /><br />Although the themes are familiar, the characters are engaging and loveable.  Blu (Jesse Eisenberg) is a domesticated macaw from a small-town who embarks on an adventure in Rio de Janeiro with native, Jewel (Anne Hathaway) to save endangered animals.  Credit goes to the writers for providing a sharp, witty dialog and the voice actors for bringing the animated characters to life.  In addition to the incredible computer generated visuals, the music adds authentic Brazilian flavor and zest.  I love the samba and bossa nova rhythms that pulsate throughout and provide infectious energy.  Rio is not billed as a musical but it definitely has that feel and the music is what makes this fast-paced adventure so enjoyable.  The Carnival festival explodes on the screen with vigor and verve providing a dazzling display of movement and color set perfectly to music.<br /><br />Rio does not have the depth of some other animated stories; however, it is pure fun from beginning to end.  This movie is a visually stunning escape from everyday life and serves as an animated brochure for a place I hope to visit one day.<br /><br />Rio. Dir. Carlos Saldanha. Perf. Jesse Eisenberg, Anne Hathaway and George Lopez. Blue Sky Studios: 2011, Film.

B004WCTLNY|5.0|The Adjustment Bureau, directed by George Nolfi, is an action packed romance movie that captivates from beginning to end. David Norris (Matt Damon) is a rising New York politician who has a chance meeting with a professional dancer, Elise Sellas (Emily Blunt) that completely changes his life. The two fall madly in love and must deal with divine powers trying to keep them apart in a battle between free will and fate. This is a thought provoking film which challenges personal beliefs regarding a higher power and creates an interesting plot. Although I believe in free will, the possibility of \\"Adjusters\\" or \\"Angels\\" guiding our lives and keeping us on a predetermined path is intriguing. It makes me wonder what my life would look like if I chose another path or had an \\"Adjuster\\" correcting my mistakes.<br /><br />The chemistry between Matt Damon and Emily Blunt is intense and enhances the believability of David and Elise's emotions. The intimacy and impulsiveness of their first kiss leaves me feeling like they are meant to be together. Although this adds to the predictability of the ending, I appreciate David's determination to win Elise. Since I am a hopeless romantic, watching a man fight for the love of his life is very appealing.<br /><br />The cinematography is very well done and the special effects create a visually exciting chase scene through Manhattan. The seamless transition as the characters move supernaturally through doors all over the city is mesmerizing. After living and working in Manhattan for many years, the backdrop evokes a feeling of nostalgia and makes me a little biased towards movies set in New York City. The music of Thomas Newman, one of my favorite film score composers, is engaging and compliments the feeling of romance between David and Elise, as well stimulates the action scenes throughout the film.<br /><br />The Adjustment Bureau is entertaining and emotionally gratifying with a love conquers all theme. I look forward to watching again.<br /><br />The Adjustment Bureau. Dir. George Nolfi. Perf. Matt Damon and Emily Blunt: 2011, Film.Dir. George Nolfi. Perf. Matt Damon and Emily Blunt: 2011, Film.

B00005JKG9|5.0|Welcome to the wonderful world of real estate, where the golden rule is \\"A.B.C., Always Be Closing (Glengarry Glen Ross).\\"  This means lie, cheat, steal and do whatever it takes to \\"get them to sign on the line which is dotted (Glengarry Glen Ross).\\"<br /><br />A highly competitive group of real estate salesmen struggle to close deals in a tough market with weak leads.  In an effort to motivate the team, corporate bigwigs raise the stakes of the monthly sales contest.  Blake (Alec Baldwin), the corporate henchman on a mission to enforce the rules, announces the prize: \\"First prize is a Cadillac Eldorado.  Second prize is a set of steak knives. Third prize is you're fired (Glengarry Glen Ross).\\"<br /><br />The intense ultimatum is music to the ears of Ricky Roma (Al Pacino) who is the office superstar.  However, rivalries erupt under pressure and the office becomes a breeding ground of anxiety, tension and desperation.  Shelly Levine (Jack Lemon) clings to his faded glory while the other agents, Dave Moss (Ed Harris) and George Aaronow (Alan Arkin) concoct a profitable scheme to get them back on their feet.  When John Williamson (Kevin Spacey), the snide office manager, announces the good leads were taken during a robbery, everyone is a suspect.<br /><br />Glengarry Glen Ross is a splendid film adaptation of David Mamet's 1984 Broadway play, directed by James Foley.  This is an exceptionally well-written script with a phenomenal cast that transforms material, which is not inherently cinematic, into an interesting and intriguing film.  The film does not rely on special effects to hold the attention of the audience; it achieves this with a natural dialogue that realistically portrays multi-dimensional characters.  The characters are complicated with a mix of good and bad in each of them.  They banter back and forth, interrupt each other and at times it's hard to tell who's right and who's wrong.  These conversations add interest and enhance the reality of the film.<br /><br />Glengarry Glen Ross is not what anyone would consider a feel-good movie, but there is appeal in the testosterone driven behavior of these characters that use memorable lines like razor ribbon to cut each other down.  I find it interesting that some have claimed Glengarry Glen Ross is about the \\"evils of the free-enterprise system.\\"  I feel it is more about basic human evolution and survival of the fittest in a cut-throat world.  This is evident in the fact that Ricky evolves to be the top-dog and consequently leads his mentor, Shelly, into proverbial extinction.  They are all like animals struggling to survive in their environment.<br /><br />David Mamet contributes greatly to the film's success with an exquisite script.  However, the attention to detail within the set design is noteworthy because it adds irony and reality to the film.  A majority of the film is set within the walls of a drab, depressing office which is filled with inspirational wall hangings containing messages that seem to daunt more than inspire.  Additionally, a picture of Shelly Levine's daughter sits on his desk in serene contrast to the all-male cast and surrounding chaos.  The irony continues throughout the film and enhances the empathic feeling at the end.<br /><br />Although some feel the performances of Al Pacino and Jack Lemmon stand out among the cast of equals, I disagree.  I feel each performance stands out individually without overshadowing the other and allows us to view into each of the character's psyche.  Some characters have more time on screen and are more likeable than others which may influence opinions.  Oddly enough my favorite character is Blake.  Blake does not appear in the play, but was added by David Mamet in the film adaptation.  He is a heartless narcissist who takes great pleasure in his nefarious behavior and even goes so far as to show everyone his \\"brass balls\\".  Even though Blake is a man I love to hate, he has some of the most memorable lines in the movie which I have been quoting for years.  As I reach for a cup of coffee, I can hear Blake's voice saying: \\"Coffee is for closers (Glengarry Glen Ross).\\"<br /><br />The collaborative effort of David Mamet and James Foley produced a film which successfully transitioned a theatrical performance to the screen without losing any of its integrity.  The effective use of close-ups keeps the focus on the dialog which is the quintessential element of the film's success.<br /><br />Glengarry Glen Ross. Dir. James Foley. Perf.

B0050PYNN0|2.0|Silly me hoped for another [[ASIN:B000TJBNHG The Princess Bride (20th Anniversary Edition)]] or [[ASIN:B001AQR3IU Stardust [Blu-ray]]], but what I got was far from the normal fantasy movie. It tries hard to be funny and vulgar and mostly ends up vulgar. The trailers shows the best scenes of the movie and hides it's true overall nature or I would not have bought it without renting it first. Fans of the movie [[ASIN:B001J9KJ4I Pineapple Express (Single-Disc Unrated Edition)]] may enjoy it or those that like strictly crude and vulgar movies without much of a funny script. This is certainly not a family movie. My guess is it won't do particularly well in a broad audience because it caters to a select few young stoners. The language is almost non-stop R or worse. It could have been so much more if the script wasn't so full of foul mouthed obscenities it treads far from any believability as a medieval period piece or even a far out fantasy. I recommend you rent it if you have any interest in it whatsoever. I'm donating my copy as I have no desire to see it again. By the way hanging someones genitals around the neck wasn't funny unless you take lots of drugs. I don't need to in order to know true comedy, so I wasn't amused.

0553801473|3.0|Six years in the making; over a thousand pages in length: while A Dance with Dragons has gone on to become an instant super bestseller (as well as the hardcover outselling the eBook edition), sadly the best thing about this book is really that fantastically mesmerizing cover.  This mighty tome falls more in line with its less well received and not so well reviewed predecessor, A Feast for Crows, than with the groundbreaking first three books of A Song of Ice and Fire.  It seems that time may not be the best thing for George R. R. Martin when it comes to writing his epic series, as he seems to enjoy spending more time describing scenery, and food, and anything gruesome or unpleasant than moving the story along.  He goes on tangents, taking trips with new characters that appear to have little bearing on the main plot; or spends literally hundreds of pages with characters readers have come to know so well and love . . . and nothing bloody happens!  Martin is becoming what can only really be truthfully described as Jordanian; no he's not immigrating to Jordan, but writing in the style of the man who became the true master of the \\"massive mass market,\\" Robert Jordan.<br /><br />Warning: here be spoilers.<br /><br />In the North, around the Wall, King Stannis Baratheon seems to spend a lot of time trying to decide what to do with no real power or army to use, while listening to Lady Melisandre, who continues to spout enigmatic prophecies that make little sense; yet readers do get to enjoy a chapter from her viewpoint for the first time.  Meanwhile, Jon Snow is elected as the 998th Lord Commander of the Night's Watch, as he must deal with not just enemies beyond the Wall, but also amongst the very men he leads and is in charge of.  He works with the wildlings, bringing them south of the wall to bolster his forces in preparation for a possible attack from the Others; it seems to be an interesting act of diplomacy, but goes on for far too many pages, with little action or continuing story taking place.<br /><br />Much of the rest of the book takes place to the far east.  Martin has provided a couple of new maps, but nothing so clearly defined and comprehendible as the great continent of Westeros.  Tyrion flees to Pentos, drowning himself in wine.  He is forced to join with a group traveling to Meereen, along with the apparently not so dead prince Aegon Targaryen.  Tyrion - as he always does - manages to get involved in a whole variety of adventures, including the meeting of another dwarf, and a female no less!<br /><br />Daenerys is the character that seems most put through the ringer in this book; much like Cercei was in A Feast for Crows.  She is no longer the tough, proud, defiant woman that everyone feared, and not just because she has three growing dragons.  Having conquered Meereen, she should be the unstoppable, unquestionable queen that she is, and yet insurrection is afoot and Daenerys cannot seem to decide what to do; perhaps it is because she has become obsessed and besotted with one of her soldiers and seems to be able to think of little else when he is nearby, and yet he is of lower class and cannot possibly be her husband.  The black dragon, Drogon, meanwhile is running rampant through the countryside as growing \\"teenage\\" dragons do, and Daenerys has no idea how to control him.<br /><br />Finally there is Quentyn Martell, Prince of Dorne, whose story comes from nowhere as we follow his trek across the lands to Meereen, where he hopes to woo Daenerys by enslaving one of her dragons.  It does not end well for him.  Interspersed throughout the lengthy book are other POV chapters from the likes of Bran Stark, Davos Seaworth, Reek (who is in fact the very not dead Theon Greyjoy), Arya Stark, Victarion Greyjoy, as well as some surprise cameos from Jaime and Cercei Lannister.  These appearances may not have be so incomprehensible if their storylines were allowed to go somewhere, and yet many of them barely get one chapter, leaving the reader wondering why they were ever added to this book in the first place.  What was the point?  Especially when many hundreds of pages are spent on other main characters, with very little happening with them, other than plenty of description of what they're wearing, what they're eating, and what the scenery looks like.  Pure Jordanian!<br /><br />At a recent signing, George R. R. Martin briefly brought up one of his most tumultuous periods in the six-year writing saga of A Dance with Dragons, saying that in a year or two who would discuss it in greater detail once everyone had read the book, but confessing that he had sacrificed at least a year at what he refers to as his \\"Meereenese Knot,\\" in trying to decide how events were to transpire and what characters and POVs were to be involved, featuring rewrite after rewrite after rewrite.  It seems Martin may have in fact written himself into a deep, dark pit of despair that he hasn't really been able to write himself out of.  Perhaps he should've scrapped everything and started again?  After sacrificing over a half a decade of his life and the reader's impatient waiting, he couldn't exactly do that.  Instead, the result is a book that is too long, has too little going on, and falls behind A Feast for Crows in that it is that much longer with less important story happening.<br /><br />There may be a number of readers under the same delusion suffered by those who professed the excellence and genius of the Star Wars prequels, starting with A Phantom Menace; but over time have come to realize the error of their ways and the true reality of the situation.  A Dance with Dragons just simply isn't that good of a book, but does serve to further the story somewhat, and fill in the details with many words and many pages and little action.  At the end readers will certainly be left unsatisfied, as they ponder on the possibilities of the penultimate book in the seven-book series (assuming it will stay at this number) with The Winds of Winter, where winter will supposedly have finally arrived.  The question remains: if winter is finally here, how long will it be before readers actually get to read about it?<br /><br />Originally written on August 9, 2011  ©Alex C.

B00009Z574|4.0|After the creative downhill spiral that came on the heels of 90125, we should be grateful for Tormato. I bought it upon its release, and Yes' message was clear: they were seriously updating their sound. The short and fast songs were a clear nod to the punk & new wave culture of the times. Did it work? They nearly pulled it off.     There are two categories of songs on Tormato. First, the band-propelled ones that are both punchy and at times furious. From the regal \\"Future Times\\" to \\"Don't Kill the Whale\\" with Howe on fire and the breathless \\"Release Release\\", these pieces are bursting with strong ideas and energy. Yet the crowning achievement among them is the superlative \\"On the Silent Wings of Freedom\\" -- a truly modern sounding Yes classic that is brimming with inspired playing, beguiling structures, and a wholly powerful presence. It belongs to Yes' best.     Oh, and did I fail to mention they're all quite catchy (not just Yes-like brilliant), as short songs ought to be?  (No wonder Buggles were recruited for Drama and partly for 90125 -- Yes apparently had a knack for the 3-minute soundbite way back then.)    The other category is of a softer kind, often led by Jon Anderson. If you like his airy-fairy touch, you'll love \\"Circus of Heaven\\", \\"Madrigal\\", and perhaps appreciate \\"Arriving UFO\\", the only song on the album that feels undeveloped and could've been so much more. These are the kind of pieces he would do on the brilliant Short Stories with Vangelis (later excursions were a mixed bag).     There's only one real clunker here, and that is Squire's by-the-numbers ballad (!) \\"Onward\\", which may be Yes' most conventional and uninventive moment up to then. It's unlistenable unless you're into droll love songs.     End result? Barring \\"UFO\\" & \\"Onward\\", they're keepers and yet, with the exception of the jaw-dropping \\"On the Silent Wings of Freedom\\", they miss that old Yes flair for expanding, exploring, and soaring the heights. Still, the muse had not deserted them completely.     Why on Earth did they call this Tormato?!
B000O8OTNC|4.0|I got this to have when I don't have access to a proper sharpening kit. It won't get a razor edge on most knives, but it certainly works wonders considering the original condition of some of my test knives. My only real beef with it is that I think it would benefit from the body being aluminum rather than plastic. There are already deep gashes (my fault, but still).      I still highly recommend this sharpener. If anything breaks I'll amend this review.
B004UXUSIM|5.0|I hope my review title is sufficiently ambiguous. It might mean: \\"Nobody delivers such wit and poignancy in human words as Woody Allen in his film persona as .... Woody Allen.\\" Or it might mean: \\"Nobody really spouts so much blather so interminably as Woody Allen in his logorrhea mode.\\" Either interpretation would be sustainable. But in this film, written of course by Allen, actor Owen Wilson is assigned the task of talking just like Woody... and he pulls it off expertly.<br /><br />I had misgivings at the start, when Wilson's Woody-talk is heard behind the titles. I had an awful premonition that this would be a 'talky' psycho-morass like several of Allen's films of the 1990s. But it isn't that at all. It's a whimsical romp through Paris now and before, a spoof of Ernest Hemingway, Scott Fitzgerald, Gertrude Stein, and all the sainted luminaries of art and literature in the Fabulous '20s. Hemingway is deliciously portentous, Fitzgerald is as haplessly vague as his own Gatsby, and Stein is grandmotherly.<br /><br />It's a lot of fun! Not a mindless 'popcorn' flick, but an entertainment anyway.

B0038M2AZA|5.0|Everyone should see this wonderful movie.  I have read about autism, but I learned so much about this condition.  Temple Grandin is an awesome lady.
B004ODLUGM|5.0|I had no idea when I received this DVD that it was also a best-selling children's book.  After watching it I have NO trouble seeing why.  This story is so adorable!   And my kids just LOVE it!  Any time a visitor comes over my daughter wants to show them the movie..lol  It's 40 minutes long and also has bonus content.   Besides the story I love the music.  It is really beautiful!  A rare thing in children's dvd's.
0439023521|5.0|This book blew me away! For a while, I haven't read a book I can't put down and made me excited to go home so I can continue reading. Yesterday I ordered the next books on Amazon Prime and could only wish the next books arrive today... I underestimated that I will finish the entire book last night! I'm excited to read about what happens next and until then I could only keep my fingers crossed.
B00000DHZJ|5.0|This is a great album by the best rock guitrarist ever.  Sorry, Eric, Carlos, and George, but this guy had it all.  I have been looking for one CD with all the best, and now I have it!

B00006CXSS|5.0|Realistic, touching, inspiring, factual, informative and entertaining all at the same time. The \\"Band of Brothers\\" HBO mini-series may be among the best (if not the best itself) TV Shows/Movies on WWII. I have seen it many many times and still can't get enough of it. It depicts the heroism of 'the greatest generation' and tells their story like it really happened. Great acting, beautiful story and factual film making has made this a great show. Any one interested in true story of the Band of Brothers must watch this. You won't be disappointed. 5/5
081297381X|5.0|This is probably the best book I have ever read. It really changes our view on what's going on in our life. Explaining how things operate in different filds of human activity and also gives valuable advice how to avoid being a sucker and resist our seemingly reasonable temptations to find cause for every effect. I recomment this book to anyone that can connect the dots.
0062060554|1.0|This is a cautionary tale to keep women in their place.  Written by a man, this fantasy novel is just disgusting. Women if you even think of cheating on your man, the consequences to your Loving family and yourself are just not worth it.  Ugh.  What is this 1957?  Tripe.

B0036S4CTS|5.0|Initially I had a hard time liking the characters but as they grew as characters, I also liked them more and more. Several parts of the story were completely unexpected but all in all a great story. Ultimately, I LOVED it and will read it again. It is a new favorite and I am sure I will love the movie as well.
B001PU8N0I|5.0|Enjoyed every segment of this series.  Very well done in all aspects.  One minor character showed ample amounts of bosom, which was unnecessary and a discredit to the show.  One charactor, sort of a houseman, played the part of a \\"heavy\\" but was really funny and not all that bad.
0470913029|3.0|I'm a big supporter of the Paleo diet concept and the idea that we need to eat the traditional foods our genes need to be healthy.<br /><br />This book claims to be the last word in explaining what our ancestors ate, and to not be just another book full of fads, but it is seriously flawed. The author seems to be trying to merge information on what the caveman diet consisted of with as many modern food fads as possible. He is particularly ignorant about healthy fats and oils.<br /><br />The book is also not very convincing in the way it explains the scientific basis for the Paleo diet.<br /><br />I disagree with the authors very-low salt stance and would advise them to read about unrefined sea salt and the work of Dr Brownstein on the many myths about salt and low-salt diet scaremongering, and the cholesterol scaremongering as well. The author has also been grossly misinformed about saturated fats. You should probably ignore what the author says about fats and oils in this book, as most of it is just plain wrong.<br /><br />Liquid vegetable oils did not exist in paleolithic times and cooking with flax oil is very unhealthy! Saturated fats are also an important part of a healthy diet, and eating eggs does NOT raise your cholesterol levels. The 'very high' cholesterol levels mentioned in the book of 208 are also not high at all, and well within the healthy range of 200 - 240 according to lipid expert Mary Enig PhD.<br /><br />The healthiest oils to cook with are ghee (unless you're 100% dairy free), lard, tallow, coconut and palm oils and olive oil. Oils should never be heated to very high temperatures such as in deep frying. These are the traditional fats to cook with, not flax oil!<br /><br />The book is also very inconsistent and vague when it comes to talking about supplements. The recommendation given for vitamin C is very low and only the alpha tocopherol form of vitamin E is recommended rather than a supplement containing all 8 forms. Vitamin C is a genuine exception to the 'too good to be true' rule. Vitamin C is the way nature designed us to deal with stress and disease, as can be seen when we look at animals that still produce their own vitamin C in their livers. Vitamin C helps diseases of all varieties as well as all oxidative stress and is one of the safest substances you can ingest, even at very high doses. It is also not a good idea to take only a few supplements in larger doses as this creates imbalances, and a general basic supplementation regime is a much healthier option.<br /><br />The book also claims 'protein can't be overeaten' which is just not true as excessive protein intake stresses the liver. When fat intake is more reasonable one would probably not overeat protein, but with a lower fat intake this could easily happen surely - you have to eat something. Far healthier than a very high protein eating plan is a high fat, moderate protein and low carb eating plan as described in the books on traditional eating listed below. Our ancestors ate a lot of fat and a lot of it was saturated. Saturated fat offers many benefits to the body.<br /><br />The author is also wrong about the 'calories in, calories out' theory of weight loss. As the book 'Good Calories, Bad Calories' by Gary Taubes explains:<br /><br />1. The 'calories in, calories out' mantra is a myth<br /><br />2. 'A calorie is a calorie is a calorie' is a myth<br /><br />3. The 'just eat less and do more exercise to lose weight' message seems to be logical but is actually wrong and unhelpful<br /><br />4. Overweight and obese people often eat no more calories, or even less, than their thinner counterparts<br /><br />5. Low calorie diets also reduce the amount of nutrients in the diet<br /><br />6. Dietary fat, including saturated fat, is not a cause of obesity. Refined and easily digestible carbs causing high insulin levels cause obesity.<br /><br />The book 'Know Your Fats' by lipid expert Mary Enig PhD explains the facts about fats and oils and whythe saturated fat = heart disease hypothesis is wrong.

B004FRX0MY|3.0|The cool thing about the MP3 app is the Cloud  service and the store has some of the music I listen to, is relatively cheaper than iTunes. Cloud service is cool. I really don't have to worry about hogging up the memory on the device and I still have an unlimited data plan and plan to keep until I am forced over to capped plan :)<br /><br />Now the bad. Performance wise it just sucks. No nice way to put it. I was searching for a song through the app, force closes =/. Attempted to play the song through via cloud, times out and either prompts for a force close or ask to wait. Seems to be hit or miss right now. Maybe its carrier performance or maybe its app, but if i can stream video via Netflix or Crackle, i tend to point to a performance issue with the app. I truly understand the difficulties of having to make the app compatible with the different devices. Like a computer, you can run windows, but depending on hardware you may not be able to run something someone else can. That said, I hope they address the performance issue in the near future. Oh I am using the Motorola Atrix.
B003ZSJ212|1.0|With the obscene amount of money this franchise has made, it a downright crime that they could not pony up the dough and do it right. I am a die hard, true blue Star Wars fan and have purchased a copy in almost every format made but I wont buy this version.
B004QMW1NM|3.0|I was drawn to the band because of their single hits \\"Punching In A Dream, Young Blood, and Girls Like You\\" and I was immediately hooked! They reminded me of Passion Pit, a little bit of The Temper Trap, and The XX I was so excited to finally have found a new band to listen to and so I bought the album. And needless to say I was very disappointed with the rest of the cd, even after a couple of listens. Almost none of the other songs didn't have the good hooks that the singles did, the only songs that stuck out to me that were not singles were \\"Frayed\\" and \\"No Way\\" and those two songs are the only reason why I gave the album an overall rating of 3/5, but almost every other track on this cd is skipable.<br /><br />So my advice is as the title of my review says...<br />just stick to the singles.
0670022411|2.0|Started out pretty well. A good premise but then degenerated into god knows what. It did make me hungry though because of all the descriptions of food and wine and taste. Maybe should have been a cookbook. And after 577 pages to have no real ending is a little much.

Great job in providing just enough levels to get started but complexity has been steadily increasing. Only one problem that I&apos;ve been having is selecting the beams that come out of the prism. Almost gave up on it in the beginning. For that, I give it a 4 star.
B004LWZW4M|5.0|This film is excellent, and that is saying a lot when expectations were never that high for the film.    I think a part of it was down to the CGI in the trailer. The CGI is by no means bad, but we still seem to be a long way away from CGI that leaves you wondering whether it is real or CGI. However, in the case of rise of the apes - the story, most of all characterisation, lift the film away from that shortcoming.    The writing is excellent, and the apes seem almost better actors than the humans. Caesar in particular seems so full of emotion and reality that you actually look past the CGI and into the character.    This is definitely the best apes movie since the very first, which is saying something when it was made in the 60s.    I loved the apes movies when I was a kid, and this remake brings all the wonder and interest back to me.    A blockbuster movie with a brain - highly recommended.
B004YEJGEO|4.0|Please fix to light color combinations instead of paint.  This would be a great teaching tool if used properly with Red, Green, and Blue as the primary colors.

B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I am surprised at how underrated this book is. Mockingjay just as well written as the first two books, but it is not peaches and cream by any means. It is a stoically satisfying conclusion to a story about grief, strife, and the losses brought on by war. Now because the protagonist in this novel is a 17 yr old girl caught in a love triangle with two amazing guys, I suppose the general consensus was eager for a fairy tale happy ending. This is simply unrealistic and would shortchange all that the trilogy has taught the reader. I think this book is epic in its \\"OMG\\" moments with Katniss's actions. She never ceases to remind you she is full of surprises. It really speaks to the core of human willpower and strength. There were moments when I was disappointed in her and there were moments I was in complete awe at what she has done. She proves how a simple girl from the poorest district can be both mockingjay and a pawn...very Joan of Arc-esque. This book is definitely unpredictable.     What is certain is this: Those given power often become the very evil they sought to destroy. This speaks truth to the dire situation of our times.
0312430000|4.0|Dr. Atul Gawande is awesome. I first heard of him when I read about the high cost of health care in McAllen, Texas (without a corresponding increase in wellness). That article is here: [...]<br />Now in The Checklist Manifesto, Gawande says our world is becoming too complex to trust experts to remember everything, say, in surgery (he's a surgeon). So, working with the World Health Organization, he and his team developed and perfected a simple checklist for surgery, which resulted in lowered cost and improved health outcomes. He's a smart writer, self-effacing, funny, and clear. He asks the right questions and pursues his hypotheses with research. I felt I could buy into what he said.<br /><br />The problem is, \\"experts\\" (e.g. surgeons) don't like to think the difference between good and bad outcomes can be affected by such a thing as a simple checklist (however proven). So even though Gawande and the other big thinkers who he interviewed agree this could save the country HUGE amounts of money, and improve lives for most Americans, inertia and ego will no doubt block any improvements. Very sad. But nice job, Atul. You're a hero for trying.
1935670913|5.0|I would recommend this book for all writers who are trying to sell their books. It shows just what you should be doing to get buyers and loyal readers for your books. It also shows you what not to do. John's methods work and they cost nothing but time and effort. As a writer you will have put in a lot of effort to write your book. Put in a bit more and sell lots of books.
B000007URG|5.0|And with good reason, this album is absolutely amazing! This is a very good album and the cover is also pretty cool...The album flows pretty well overall and has some very high points. The high points of this album are some pretty high points in their career. Jens Johansson is amazing in this album, Tolkki is doin his usual guitar work, Kotipelto sings on the wings of an eagle, Jari is there, and Jörg is drumming very fast as usual...but I agree that Tuomo was much better. This album has many layers in the songs which makes it very interesting to listen to...<br /><br />Now: the music of this album:<br /><br />1. The Kiss of Judas- A slower-paced rock song that is a very good song. Very haunting chorus and atmosphere.<br /><br />2. Black Diamond- AWESOME SONG! Great intro on the harpsichord and amazing chorus: \\"I Know; Know I can't stay; By your side; Forever; And I won't; I won't forget; Your Beauty; My Black Diamond\\" This is definitely one of their top 5 best ever songs.<br /><br />3. Forever Free- Another fast one like Black Diamond but it rocks a bit more instead of have the classical influence...still a good song no less<br /><br />4. Before the Winter- Great ballad. Their ballads are usually pretty boss but this is great!<br /><br />5. Legions- Another fast one that rocks...good song...not too much to say<br /><br />6. The Abyss of Your Eyes- A slower paced song not like Kiss of Judas...more like Eternity from Episode. Still a good song. I like their other slower ones more, tho.<br /><br />7. Holy Light- A Strato instrumental; Not as good as the rest of the songs on this album...<br /><br />8. Paradise- Awesome song! Great message, chorus and music. Rivals Black Diamond for best on the album.<br /><br />9. Coming Home- Another good ballad. Awesome music as usual.<br /><br />10- Visions- A good Epic. Strato always knew how to make epics...it took a while for it to do so, but this one is finally starting to grow on me...I think it's definitely not their best epic, tho...Elysium is the best, then Destiny, and then Elements, then this one, then Infinity.<br /><br />Bonus Tracks:<br /><br />11. Black Diamond (Demo Version)<br /><br />12. Uncertainty (Live)- A live version of the song from Episode.<br /><br />Misprint with my disc: I really don't mind this but on my disc, Black Diamond is track 1 and Kiss of Judas is track 2...not a big deal really...<br /><br />Verdict: If you want good Power/Progressive Metal, then get this. If you like pop and rap...then why are you reading this? Anyway, this album is one of their best, tho I like Elysium, Elements Pt. 1, and Dreamspace better. Get it.
1401924751|5.0|I love Doreen Virtue as well as her books and cards. She has a genuine nurturing spirit and you can expect nothing less from her products. I knew these were a must have for me. So many people now want to know what is my calling? This deck really answers just that.<br /><br />For those that have trouble getting a accurate reading it is not the cards but the individual using the tool. One must remember this is divination tool, so you need to clear your energy the reader and receiver. There are other helpful prayer given by Doreen to help assist you in getting a more accurate reading.<br /><br />This became an instant favorite. It I were to say anything bad it is that some of the cards seem a bit repetitive like author, writer, and books. To me that's three different cards for the same thing but hey to someone else this may proove to be helpful.<br /><br />I liked them and am over all happy with them.
B005BZQS1E|2.0|I like every kind of comedy, this was pretty bad though.  Had its moments but all in all pretty bad.
B0055B0MIO|3.0|If you like Trivium and have the complete  catalog, then you can appreciate a handful of songs on this album in my opinion, being one of these fans.  Its never good thing to stay in a certain sound forever, which is why good bands like Trivium evolve and grow, which is necessary.  But after listening to the album you can tell what their intensions where as far as sound, which in turn makes for a much more mainstream accessible album to new comers to metal or just a radio lover.  Overview in my opinion:   2. In Waves- a song that doesn't make sense to me as far as arrangement.  4. Dusk Dismantled- a boring type of riff, and doesn't quite go anywhere.  5. Watch the World Burn- This is a favorite of mine on the album, good riffing and melody.  8. Ensnare the Sun- Kinda cool little melody, but I hate when bands have little one minute fillers like this in the album instead of a actual song.  10.  Caustic are the ties that blind- Another favorite on the album good riffs and melody.  13.  A Grey So Dark- Definitely the low point of the album,  I have always questioned Matt's interests in a emo-type of sound, for example- Dying in your Arms on Ascendancy, (which I thought I would never say it kicks another songs ass, but in this case it sure does).  This is as Emo as it gets, listen and  you'll see.  17. Shattering the Skies above-  A good song, but already recorded on the God of War soundtrack, not a fan when bands put previously released songs on a album.  18. Slave New World- Obviously badass Sepultura song, nothing wrong with covers but at this point during there 5th albums run, covers should be out of the question.     I didn't mention the other songs because they blend in so much,  (I have listened to the album 10 times already), they all have the same type of hammer on riffs and open string strumming choruses and melodies.  A Trivium fan should buy this album, but I would recommend not getting the special edition.  All in all the album just doesn't go anywhere for meand the arrangements are a little awkward to me.  As a big fan I will not hold this against them, because at the end of the day, its there music to be made and they don't care what anyone says.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I'm not one for Sci-Fi, but the essence and adventure of this story was captivating and overrode any hesitance I had!  You are sucked in the minute you start finish Chapter 1. I couldn't get my hands on the other 2 books fast enough, or put them down! Very descriptive and visual writing..I'm curious to see how the movie will parallel. Definitely a great series to read!
B000002OOY|5.0|This music is genius. Some of John Williams finest work, and a brilliant soundtrack. One of my favorite movies, still, and the music pulls me into to. It is epic, triumphant, fun, silly, and nostalgic. I love it, and highly recommend it.<br />Oh, and the CD is fine too. It's a CD. It's exactly what you would expect it to be.
B00020HEL6|5.0|I'm one of those who first heard Ms. Olstead sing on her old \\"Still Standing\\" sitcom.  I was amazed by her voice, and when I checked into it, was so pleasantly surprised that a young lady of her generation would pursue what is generally seen as an older music genre.      And what a pursuit of it she's making.  The \\"Summertime\\" rendition, which she also did on the show, is almost enough all by itself to warrant buying the CD.  The jazz duet version of \\"Breaking Up Is Hard To Do\\" demonstrates the work she puts into her music.    Her work must be checked out!  She deserves all the success she earns, and more.
B0055JPM6I|1.0|This movie was one of the worst films ever made that I couldn't stop watching.  It isn't funny, well done, meaningful, or even enjoyable.  Yet, it won't release its very weak but somehow invincible grip from you the whole time.

B000JBWWRY|5.0|Disney's Peter Pan has been put \\"in the vault\\", therefore is not available in the stores until they re-release it on Blu-ray in the coming years.  So happy to find it here on Amazon at a reasonable price and shipping was quick!
1451629184|5.0|First of all I would like to say what a courageous and beautiful young lady Jaycee Dugard is. I so admire her strength.    This is not a \\"feel good\\" book. If that is what you are looking for, go look for another book. Rather this is an insight of what it is like to be a kidnapped victim. I don't think there has ever been another book written by someone that was kidnapped as a child. The torture that they put this poor little innocent child through was just so awful and inhumane. The book will bring you through all kinds of emotions and you live her nightmare with her. I went to sleep and had a nightmare about it, and to think she actually lived it.   I give it five stars, not because it made me feel good to read it, but because Jaycee was able to convey what it is like to be a child, cut off from everyone she loved and had to live with a monster for 18 years. Laws need to be changed so that this NEVER has to happens to another child.
B004YEJGEO|5.0|I&apos;ve found this game to be quite diverting and entertaining.

B002OG5GT8|2.0|This amplifier provides almost no boost. If you are looking for a product to boost a weak signal for driving headphones that requires some power this is not the product for you. In fact I don't see much value in this product at all, other then a mild bass boost. I'm very dissatisfied with the product. I have since done more research and bought a CMOY based headphone amplifier - tons of power - it will drive any set of headphones. The product is called ElectricSumo. Returning it is virtually a bust as the cost of shipping, etc. outweighs the refund.
B000L3CHC0|5.0|This is the best watch I've owned in the price range - sapphire crystal face, swiss movement, very solid casing, looks great, and resistant up to 660ft (don't forget to screw down the crown).  It's versatile: nice enough to be worn daily for business, travel, light sports.  It does have a bit of heft to it but I like that.  Resizing the band was very easy.  Wish my girlfriend would have gotten me this. ;)

B0059R5Q08|3.0|I wanted to see this at the theater but I'm glad I rented it on Amazon and only spent 3.99 instead of $10. There are better movie versions of this great novel. The long version with Timothy Dalton is one of them, the 1944 version with two of the greats Orson Wells and Joan Fontaine, and my personal favorite with Samantha Morton and Ciaran Hinds (their acting was the most emotional-you could feel their pain). It is however much better than the worst version with William Hurt!
1416550534|5.0|THE HOUSE AT RIVERTON by Kate Morton is 468 pages and was published in 2006. I bought it because I adored Morton's other books, THE FORGOTTEN GARDEN and THE DISTANT HOURS. This is her first novel, and I loved it every bit as much as the others.    Grace Bradley, a woman in her nineties at a nursing home, is approached by a film director making a movie about Riverton House: the place where Grace was a servant in the early nineteen hundreds for the Hartford family. Visits from actors, old photographs, studio stages, and finally, the house itself reawaken memories Grace has buried for decades. As she nears the end of her life, she forces herself to confront her past and what happened on that fateful night when the Hartford family legacy was forever stained.    Grace begins her service with the Hartford family as a young girl at the urging of her mother. The lives of the servants at Riverton are every bit as dramatic and intriguing as the lives of the wealthy family that owns the home, and their loyalty is largely unparalleled.    Siblings Hannah, Emmeline, and David are the lifeblood of the home, and their relationships, secrets, and games entrance Grace while stirring her envy and admiration. Hannah takes the most notice of the young serving girl, and as time progresses, cultivates a relationship with her of extreme trust and dependence.    As the war comes and takes the men in body and in spirit, the Hartford siblings become scattered and lost. Hannah and Emmeline long for independence and take different steps to obtain it-steps that have terrible and far reaching consequences.    Morton's strengths are in her deft rendering of intimate friendships and complexities of plot. Story lines are woven through time, space, and character with facility. She is a master of suspense, and even when some stories can be guessed, others come as a complete surprise. All three of Morton's novels have kept me entertained throughout and satisfied upon their conclusion.    Morton has established herself as one of the great literary gothic writers of our time. I recommend her books easily to those who enjoy all kinds of novels from historical, to suspense, to romance. She has elements of all genres in her works, and the beautiful prose to make her work timeless.
B005AUWY90|1.0|To those who say \\"it's a kids movie, you should expect an award-winning film\\", I have to point out movies like the Toy Story movies, Megamind, Incredibles, and many, many more that are a 100 times better than Cars 2.  We can expect more and have been led to expect more.  Also, others point out the violence in this particular movie.  Well we're not super-sensitive to that type of thing, our 5 year-old sees stuff much worse and plays video games much worse.  That being said, Cars 2 seems to be aimed at toddler-aged children primarily and the story doesn't betray that aim, I was pretty surprised when a hero-type character was actually tortured and, well...killed.  If you're little one doesn't play Black Ops like mine does, and is a more sensitive type, you might want to skip this one.  It also struck me as odd that a star like Owen Wilson was completely given the back seat to...Larry The Cable Guy??  This story was 90% Mater with Lightning being merely a side-story.  The movie just felt very long, which isn't a good sign.  Parents and teens were pretty severely bored.  The 5 year-old was ready to leave about 2/3 of the way thru, if that.  Keep in mind he's not one who would rank Cars as his all-time favorite or anything like that, but he does like the original and he does have a lot of Cars junk so he is a fan.  Not sure how much he's into it now though.  Bottom line, this one was a snoozer for the older people and seemed to be out of focus for it's target audience, the little ones.
B004BLTNJI|3.0|okay, I'll comment on ALL ascpects of the movie...    This is actually a great story and story line... however, as many others have pointed out, it is creepy and actually too scary for small kids...  I defn wouldn't show it to any child under the age of 10...    3D aspect... well, the colors were great, but, it truly didn't take advantage of 3D technology...  so, if you are getting this movie for 3D, I'd say don't!!!  spend it on either Avatar, Open Season (which I'd let kids of any age watch) or Alice in Wonderland.....
B000002UVX|5.0|I heard this album. It is still one of my favorite Hendrix albums with a particular mood and remembrance apart from all the others. If you don't own this, get it as soon as you can, sit down without interruption and listen to it.

1400079144|1.0|I'm not a big fan of fiction because maybe they don't really suspend my disbelief. The stories on the symbolism was done very well but the tension did not hold up for me. The thing on Freemasonry was a bit overdone and it just didn't keep me glued. The division of the chapters and the characters didn't all work for me. I don't know why. It's not as bad as 'The Copper Scroll' and the 'The Afghan' by Forsyth was definitely more exciting. I just don't see myself buying anything Dan Brown again.<br />He did great research on his symbolisms and background but even that did not entertain me.<br />In the end I think his characters just were not fleshed-out enough for me. I've been reading a lot of non-fiction on psychopaths and serial killers and was expecting to see a clear supporting pattern with the evil-dude character. I want my villains to make the hair on the back of my neck stand. Maybe I was just expecting too much.
B001EN71DG|5.0|This is the set you want, if you want the originals of 4, 5, and 6 as shown  in the theatres. The newer special editions are great also. The bonus discs  are the originals. My collection is now complete. Very happy with this.
B004UXXVQS|5.0|Personally I think this is their best album.  I listen to it start to finish, not a bad song on it.  Was impressed even more after seeing the Rock Doc \\"Back and Forth\\".  They basically made the album at Dave's home studio on old school tape.  No digital remastering and fixing stuff.  It's a masterpiece!
B004ZZS4CC|3.0|I thought the book would have better. Several parts of the book lost my interest, because subjects were drawn out more then should have been. However...for never writing a book before this, it was ok. Also, I thank her for sharing her story.

B0042U94UQ|5.0|Despicable Me tells the story of a man, Gru, who is just trying to be the best at what he does, but being a villain happens to be his profession. His objective is to steal what others cannot in order to achieve his life long ambition to be the world's worst villain. The minions assist him in his outlandish quests and they add a nice touch to his mischief, sort of like a bunch of little Igors in the laboratory. As the story unfolds, you can't help but have sympathy for the despicable man. Understanding his childhood sheds a lot of light on the way he is. The characters have genuine personality flaws that are taken to humorous lengths. The despicable guy turns out to be a softee and the lady at the children's home talks with a sweet, soft Southern voice but what she says and does is mean! Then there's the element of competition that takes it to another level.<br /><br />Gru and the young punk Vector duel for the top spot. They even go so far as to seek loans for their villainous enterprises. (There are some sly references to the recent banking fallout.) Gru and Vector are both very intelligent and inventive and they come up with some beyond James Bond gadgets. Gru develops a plan to seize the amazing shrink-ray gun that will enable him to steal the unimaginable-the moon. Yes, the moon! His plan to gain entrance into Vector's inpenetrable house involves the three orphan girls, but in the end it is the young sisters who manage to steal Gru's heart.

B003Y5H53S|2.0|I picked this up thinking it would be a movie the whole family could enjoy. Fortunately, the kids opted for something else to do and midway into the film I was glad. The PG rating is given clarification before the movie begins and discloses that it contains crude humor, and they weren't kidding. PG-13 would be more accurate. I'm not sure who the intended audience is. It's too crude for young children, in spite of the cute little lizard, and not that entertaining for adults either.<br /><br />The story starts slow, but then when Rango reacts to a potentially dangerous situation by taking on the necessary traits that will disguise his fear and weaknesses, the film livens up somewhat. He remembers that he can be whoever he wants to be and portrays himself as a hero of the old west by telling a tall tale which sets the stage for the rest of the story. His verbal tango is actually a good scene. I did laugh in places, but overall, the movie doesn't match its potential.<br /><br />P.S. After reading other reviews I'm getting the gist that Rango is a series of old western spoofs along with other genres. As with all spoof movies, they are more enjoyable if you have seen the original productions.
B0040JHWKS|4.0|I loved his debut and Born to Run. My favourite has always been Darkness. The River would be a great single LP (of course, I get to choose the 12 tracks!). Born in the USA? Bruce and I started moving away from each other at that point. Since then I have bought most of his Cds and have really enjoyed some - Nebraska, Joad, and Tunnel. When The Promise was announced I was kind of dubious. After all, how often does music from 30 year old vaults amount to much more than historical interest? Was it realistic to think that a well established artist like Springsteen would have a double Cd of previously unreleased studio tracks that would be interesting to anyone but die hard fans? Logically one should not be judged too harshly for asking the obvious - if these songs were any good then surely they wouldn't have been gathering dust for over thirty years, would they? Well, the simple answer is that this double Cd, while not up to the lofty standards of Springsteen's troika of pre 1979 records is still, nonetheless, a worthy addition to his discography.<br /><br />Many of the reviewers who have posted negatively have observed that The Promise is musically, lyrically and stylistically different from Darkness and/or Born and that, for this reason, they are disappointed with the release. They are undeniably correct that the songs on this collection are, for the most part, less dramatic/bombastic than those on Born to Run and are certainly \\"poppier\\"/lighter in tone than those on Darkness. However, the fact that they were recorded concurrently with those that did make the cut for Darkness doesn't necessarily make them inferior. They are simply different. If your expectation is for this Cd to be a reprise of either Born to Run or Darkness then you are headed for a letdown. If, on the other hand, you are a Springsteen fan and are open to what is essentially \\"another side of Bruce\\", the side that looked back to the 60's for inspiration, then you should welcome this as a treasure trove. For sure there are some misses. There are far more hits and I, for one, am delighted that Springsteen has released this set. As for those who see the entire project as money grab, well, come on! One, Bruce doesn't need the money. Two, those of us who like the Cd far outnumber those of you who don't and surely that alone makes The Promise worthwhile.re there are some misses.

B004YEJGEO|4.0|Fun and challenging puzzle solver, but after 15 levels solved I&apos;m &gt;&lt; this close to uninstalling it. The problem is the prisms. They don&apos;t behave consistently, and making a change on the board often causes them to reset the in\/out angles, turns inputs into outputs or vice versa. In a complex solution you wind up having to place and remove them several times to get them to do what you want and it gets very frustrating.\n
B0000524CY|3.0|Ok to start off, this movie was good. It wasn't necessarily scary, just really freaky. Many scenes were horrific and disgusting! The movie was good, especially being made quite a long time ago. It was really slow at some parts, but otherwise it was a freaky, good, interesting movie which is what people will get when they purchase this. It's a classic to see! I don't recommend purchasing it, just renting it would be enough! I've owned it for a long time and only watched it 2-3 times.
B0015DWJX2|5.0|I appreciate this story about the Channel Islands during German occupation immensely.  I couldn't put it down.  The story unfolds via letters between the many lovable characters.  It's heart wrenching, funny, sassy and bittersweet.  I see a movie in the future (but not sure it can do the book justice).
0393061310|3.0|Now this is a good book. It might appeal to some yet some might hate it. It's all a matter of opinion. I had to read this book for my AP World History class. I skimmed through most of it, just trying to find the answers to my questionnaire I had to complete. The book is very lengthy and can get boring. Some chapters, like the one about Pizarro and Atahualpa, were very interesting! If you want to learn about why human development proceeded at such different rates on different continents then read the book! That topic may very well peak your interest. The theories provided in the book make sense and I have to say I agree with most of them.
B0055HVDZ4|5.0|This re-issue is great. The packaging is nice, and if the label on the shrink wrap is true, is a re-creation of the original packaging. But since I never saw the original one, I can't verify that. But anyway, the sound is great and is from the original ANALOG tapes. This isn't some 16-bit digital remaster put on a record, it's from the analog tape, and it indeed has that wonderful warm sound so characteristic of pure analog recordings on a vinyl. You won't be disappointed by this. It's 180 gram, so it won't warp easily, and there is very little surface noise so I think it probably is made of un-recycled virgin vinyl. If you're a Sabbath fan , and have a record player, buy this!
B00005JKMQ|3.0|I've been fascinated by Muhammad Ali ever since I learned about way back in elementary school. And I love Will Smith! Thus I had high expectations for this movie, but sadly it couldn't live up to them.<br /><br />The acting was fine, though. I also liked that there was so much included about his personal life, even though it wasn't the entire story. His relationships with a couple of women and his interactions with Malcolm X, as well as his choice not to fight in Vietnam and the consequences that followed were all documented in here, and fairly well at that. It's good that at the very least, this movie showed what Ali's life was like in the most dramatic years of his life.<br /><br />But as you may be able to guess, this story wasn't inclusive, and I was left with all sorts of questions about what happened before and after this climactic time period in Ali's life. There wasn't anything about his childhood, much less how and why he became a boxer. It's as if the movie expects you to come into it already knowing what happened before.<br /><br />The movie mainly focuses on his personal relationships, his religious identity, his issues with Vietnam, and his big fight in Zaire against Foreman. Even during some of these parts, his life is flashing so fast that I often had to rewind to figure what happened. Even though reading his biography afterwards helped me fill in the rest of the blanks, I shouldn't have had to do that. A biographical film is supposed to teach me most of what I want to know.<br /><br />And even though I don't blame this on Will Smith, I think Ali's character was a bit stiff in the movie. He wasn't very likable, to be honest. I know I shouldn't expect him to be all smiles and hugs, as real people are not like that, but his irritability didn't make the movie any more appealing. I certainly hope the real Ali is not like that.
B004E547D8|5.0|We have been so pleased with this film.  Willis, Mirren, Morgan, and Malcovich truly deliver a great piece of entertainment.  Granted there are a few cliches seeded throughout the storyline, but this is definitely an amusing movie to watch on those rainy or lazy days.
B003Y5H574|5.0|I had lost faith in romantic comedies for a while now--always the same plot, the same clich&eacute;s, and the chemistry between the characters was not very believable. And while I can't guarantee you that this is the perfect movie, it was a refreshing, funny, and original story.<br /><br />You'll find out what the movie's about in the first ten minutes: Emily (Julianne Moore) announces she hasn't been faithful and wants a divorce. This leaves Cal (Steve Carell) in a downwinding spiral. He's never been single since he was 15, and he's never been with anyone else...that leaves a lot of room for him to make mistakes with all sorts of new women as he tries to cope with the anguish of losing his soul mate. Enmeshed in this movie are also subplots about the romantic interests of his children's babysitter, his son, and his new friend from the bar, a confident young bachelor who helps Cal refine and redefine himself.<br /><br />You'll get practically everything in this film that a great movie is supposed to have: believable relationships, excellent popular culture references, and the kind of wry humor Steve Carell is famous for (as seen in [[ASIN:B004AV5GX6 Dinner for Schmucks]] and [[ASIN:B001GMAVGE Get Smart (Single-Disc Widescreen Edition)]]). Needless to say, I recommend it to everyone.

0553801473|3.0|Like so many other fans, I've waited a grand total of 5 and a half years to read this book.<br /><br />While there are many theories as to why it took Martin this long to pump out this sequel, the fact of the matter is that this book weighs in at over 1000 pages, exceeding even the massive A Storm of Swords. This many pages dedicated to A Song of Ice and Fire should be a boon to any hardcore fan of the books, in theory. But did it deliver?<br /><br />I've got a somewhat simple rule when it comes to novels... the longer it is, the better I expect the book to be. In a world where an author demands this much of my time, their story had best be worth it, because there are always other books worth reading out there. The first four books, in my opinion, were all well worth the time. Did this one follow suit?<br /><br />The good news:<br /><br />+ Martin still meets his high standards for level of detail, and his world breathes as strongly as it ever did. In retrospect, I wish I would have brushed up on the happenings of the first four books again before tackling this one. 6 years is a long time to have to remember every nuanced character and noble family crest and lineage, and who fathered what bastard, etc. But it's all well worth it. More backstory on many, many characters, and we even get more slices of history, such as parts involving Robert's Rebellion (Honestly, if Martin had the time and inclination, I'd love to see a novel on this part of Westeros history).<br /><br />+ If your favorite character was missing from A Feast for Crows, they got center stage here. Tyrion is a personal favorite of mine, and he helped carry this book for me, even if his character arc in this particular novel was well below the standards for Storm of Swords (Though to be honest, that is a hard act to follow). Daenarys also plays a major role (Well, the title sort of makes that obvious, I suppose).<br /><br />The bad news:<br /><br />- The POV character selection in this book is, by and large, about as organized as a ten year old's closet. As Martin himself states in the foreword (I only mention this to make it obvious I'm not spoiling much, if anything), some characters from Crows do pop up later in the novel. And they do. But each of them only gets one or two chapters, where not too much actually happens. Honestly, I'd have much preferred if he had left these snippets out and simply added them to the next book, rather than giving us tiny updates on characters that don't even really address anything that happened from Crows, with one exception. But, having read the ending, I can understand why he felt compelled to include what feels literally like a tiny slice of the next book.<br /><br />And then, he brings in 3 new POV characters. As if he didn't have enough already. I understand the need for one of them later in the book, but another one only gets one chapter. I didn't get a chance to feel like it built any continuity with them, and when that happens, they feel unnecessary.<br /><br />- Not too much actually happens in this novel. It's brutal, but the truth. Oh sure, some characters are left in peril, and others meet unfortunate ends. If you're a fan of this series, you already knew this was going to happen. But Martin spends almost all of those 1000 pages hyping three major conflicts, and where does the book end? Right before we learn what happens in any of them. I've heard stories of how Martin has struggled more and more to wrestle this story of his into prose, and I'm inclined to believe it. I know he's a big time veteran author with his own hit HBO series now, but the fact of the matter is that he needs an editor to help him pace his story if he really desires a return to the quality of his previous books.<br /><br />Bottom line: Was it worth it? Yes and no.<br /><br />Yes, because it's more A Song of Ice and Fire, and because this book sets up The Winds of Winter to be one of the most exciting books in the series.<br /><br />No, because this book feels like nothing but filler and cliffhangers, when it should be able to stand on its own merit.<br /><br />I can only hope this dip in quality can be rectified in the next book, and even more importantly, that I won't have to wait another 6 years to find out.

B004LWZW24|1.0|This movie would be really scary if you were either  a) 8 years old or  b) Newly arrived from Mars with no concept of what a horror cliche might be.      Seriously, it's so full of cliches I started to wonder if it was supposed to be a comedy.    The clincher is the medium.  Where did they find this woman and why did the real actors agree to work with her?  I kept hoping she would channel somebody who had taken a couple of acting lessons.  Even when she <spoiler> wound up as a corpse she was unbelievable. </spoiler>  Unbelievable but funny.  Just loll your tongue out next time - except there won't be a next time unless your (I'm assuming) producer son-in-law gets to roll another stinkburger - might I suggest \\"Insidious 2: More Sidious\\" to be followed by \\"Insidious 3: The Final Sidious\\".    I think they could have improved the movie if they'd actually had people in sheets going \\"Boo!\\".  A few rattling chains and *boom* you're making music.  Speaking of, please barf out a giant musical/noise cue everytime something scary is supposed to happen because I need to know when to experience teh horror.  Either that or realize the calendar no longer reads 1988.    But no, the director told the producer, \\"Darn it - I've seen Poltergeist 100 times and I want everybody to know that.\\"  But to mix it up, we'll have an actual  <spoiler> demon that looks like a 7-11 clerk who came across some black and red grease paint in the attic and decided he would really give the kiddies a treat this Halloween.  Look at me, I have plastic vampire teeth and cheesy contacts and I know how to use them.  So laughable.  The fact that they gave him cloven feet was when I knew it was a comedy.  Cloven feet!  LOLs galore!  You know your makeup man has mega-fail on his face when the kid's drawing is scarier than your actual demon.  At least slap some vaseline on the lens to keep us from seeing the shine from the grease paint.  The high point was when we get to go into his lair and see him sewing like Jamie Gumm.  No real reason - all evil demons sew I guess...or something.  But it sure made me think of that genuinely creepy character from 20 years ago.  If you're going to do that, just go ahead and unleash the death head moths.  Do it!  I dare you!    OMG that medium was a bad actress.  Community theater bad.  Unless she's actually good and is acting bad, in which case she deserves a special Academy Award such as the one Disney got for 7 Dwarfs.      THE CALL IS COMING FROM INSIDE THE HOUSE!  Okay, that never happened, probably because they couldn't come up with a way to work it in.  But thank god they could rip off the Poltergeist ghostbusting crew.  I was sure one of those guys was going to get it (or rip his own face off) because they were such cardboard cutout never-known-the-touch-of-a-woman geeks that killing them could be the only excuse for bringing them into the film in the first place.  Either that or the make-your-own-movie Madlib cliche generator just barfed them up by chance, along with the fact that they were dressed like LDS missionaries.  I kept wondering where their bikes were and if the dry Utah air gave them constant nosebleeds.    But oh no the ghosts are actually in the house, for reasons we don't know, and have taken physical form, such as they can appear everywhere and be illuminated by light, but instead of appearing in the actual place they want to be, or coming in through the door (since they are somehow physical ghosts) they'll appear behind creepy cabinet doors specifically so mean-geek can illuminate them and be freaked out only to run away to repeat the process for no known reason.  Make sure to bar the doors with furniture because they are GHOSTS, get it?  Or something.  Just be scared okay!

B004V5QWU2|5.0|This app is amazing. I used to have trouble sleeping until I bought this app and started paying the sounds at night.
B001PPLIFU|4.0|Quantum of Solace looks amazing in blu-ray and worth the purchase. Great action movie, even if the story isn't as strong as Casino Royale. Still, I was thoroughly entertained the entire way through and the blu-ray looks great. I love Daniel Craig as the new Bond and can't wait for Bond 23.

B004AYCWY4|2.0|After reading this book, I quickly realized that it was targeted for a particular audience--the choir complete with holy robes and clapping hands shouting, \\"...Preach it brother Dawkins, preach it my brother, Evolution AMEN!, Hallelujah!\\" I honestly think that it is required that you be a Dawkinite and part of the Dawkins Tabernacle Choir in order for you to take this book seriously.     I was fully expecting some kind of scientific treatise yet it ended up being like a bunch of guys on the dock laughing and drinking beer talking about how the big one got away. It is amazing how he comes forth in every chapter in bold declarative sentences without justifications or support (support other than being anomalous tautologies) to conclude in mealy mouthed suppositions and suggestions.     For a guy who claimed many books on evolution under his belt yet forgot to give evidence to all his previous ones until TGSOE (He even admits this), I am amazed at what people are willing to believe simply because someone says it to be thus. Dumbing down has reached a new low on this one. I cannot see how anyone who approaches the subject from a scholarly viewpoint can take this book seriously.
B000NIZPKE|5.0|I ordered this battery as an extra battery for my camcorder, and I have been very happy with my purchase. This is an original Sony battery. The price of about $20 was great, and I would order this product again from this supplier.
1567184855|5.0|I've always wonderered about the afterlife, spirits and such and now 'Journey' has answered alot of my questions.  I've somehow always believed in a higher power and that we do in fact have souls and this book provides a solid foundation of those beliefs. This book has changed my thinking and how I live my life and I owe a great debt to Dr Newton.  I have re read this book three times and each time I feel more and more connected to belief in the afterlife and no longer fear the destination of the unkknown.  \\"Destiny of Souls\\" is also a good read and a great supplement to 'Journey'.
1451629184|5.0|Just finished reading a stolen life and would recommend this book for all that care about surviving a abduction. She missed out on a big portion of her life and is coming back to life with such tremendous love even for the simple things in life. The book is written by Jaycee and you feel as if she is telling the story right to you. She survived this horrible life and many would of not wanted to live another day under those conditions. I know I would of not survived. Great inspirational book to show that you can overcome the most horrific crimes, if you try hard enough.
B004LAIU4I|4.0|This album is suprisingly good. I enjoyed it a lot. Some of the songs are a little too mellow, but over all really nice.
B004132HZS|5.0|Let me keep this concise!<br /><br />1. If you have already bought this item, welcome to the club. I have greatest respect for the choice & decision that you have made. Enjoy the series, and recommend this item to as many people as possible, hoping to make intelligent people (a highly rare species at all times, now almost extinct) more numerous.<br /><br />2. If you are thinking about when to buy this DVD/Blue-Ray, there is no time better than now, i.e. right now.<br /><br />3. If you are thinking as to whether this purchase would be justifiable, esp. if diversion of money meant for another season of your favourite TV-series is involved, my heartfelt request would be in favour of purchase (since beg/borrow/steal would not be advisable over this website), because if you have even a shred of love for anything to do with intelligence-in-action and smart storytelling, you can not live without this series. Unless you KNOW that you have these episodes in your possession where you can view them repeatedly to identify more things that \\"you had seen, but not observed\\", your nights would be bitter and days thoroughly unpleasant.<br /><br />4. If you have decided not to buy this item, but to read others' opinions regarding this item, please reconsider your decision. Not buying this DVD/Blue-Ray in its first 'Avatar' might make you very-very repentant later.<br /><br />5. If you have read the CANON, i.e. Sherlock Holmes stories by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, and are rather skeptical about their present-day presentations (esp. in the light of the Guy Ritchie movie), THIS SERIES IS ESSENTIAL FOR YOU. Even those who had decided that nobody other than Jeremy Brett can ever play Sherlock Holmes, and that the Granada Series (only the Short Stories, mind you)was the height of Televised portrayal of Holmes, have been forced to retract our opinions happily. Even without having a single pipe or deerstalker hat in sight, this series makes the most faithful re-enactment of the idea of Sherlock Holmes & Dr. John Watson, in 21st Century.<br /><br />6. If you have not read the works by Sir Arthur and only know about Holmes in a passive manner, but love CSI, House or any other TV series that deals with intelligent & slightly eccentric people doing terrific \\"stuff\\" with all the latest gadgets in conjunction with their mind (or whatever they might be using), you are bound to go ga-ga over this series. It IS one of the most brilliant TV-series that I have seen.<br /><br />So, not merely recommended, but urged-pleaded-vehemently requested-threatened-etc. etc. Please buy the item.ry.    6.

B004LWZW24|3.0|The first two acts of Insidious were nail-biting, tention-filled and truly spooky. Even the opening title sequence was creepy. Everything was spot on. The acting was great, the mood was perfectly set, you even had the creepy-looking child actor. The music was subtle and really set the tone, the newly moved-into house was filled with paranormal potentional. And it was even moreso magnified when we find out it really has nothing to do with the house!     Quick recap: A family moves into a huge, obviously creepy(but not overly so) house and then something strange happens to one of their sons, Dalton. He ends up falling and hitting his head but the next morning, he never wakes up. Doctors can't explain why he won't wake up from the coma and nothing seems to work. The family moves on, eventually caring for the son at home. That's when the actual weird stuff starts happening. The mom, played by Rose Byrne starts seeing things, hearing noises. Naturally she thinks the house is haunted though her husband, played by Patrick Wilson needs a bit of convincing. Things keep progressing to the point where she pleads to leave the house. He agrees and they move. Of course things don't die down because it has nothing at all to do with the house they are living in.     This is where the movie slowly starts heading downhill. They of course bring a paranormal specialist in on things and she explains what is happening to them, and their son. She seems to know an awful lot about these things and before we know it, a séance in the kitchen comes along, things are revealed, more odd stuff happens and finally, we get to the thrilling, super scary climax. Well, actually it really isn't all that frightening. I suppose if you scare easily, then maybe I can see this film as being an issue. Again, that's the problem with the final act. The fear-factor is all but gone. The mystery surrounding the film had been solved and there's not much left but to throw in a million different type of ghosts andbeings and gloomy smoke and makeup. The actual ending is pretty neat, but some people may see it coming.    I truly wanted to love this film and hoped it wasn't going to become a cliché like just about every other horror movie out there today. But things were revealed way too early and all the excitement and intrigue was gone. That is one reason why The Others is still one of my favorite thrillers ever. Not one drop of blood in that entire movie, but utterly spooky from beginning to end. I guess its true that the best ghost stories are where you never even see the ghosts. Sometimes, it's just overkill. Case in point- Insidious.
0307454541|5.0|I read a pre-publication review of this book and ordered it instantly. Often I'm disappointed at the disparity between the contents of a review and the contents of the book, but this time I was rewarded for my trust. I loved this book from the get-go. It's complex yet easy to follow, though you know as you're reading it that some things won't be concluded in this book but will be continued into the next. It's tense. It has great character development. Lisbeth and Mikhael and Erika are fully developed characters. Each has an ethic. Each observes, thinks, analyzes. Each acts. Seldom does a reader get such depth in a mystery-thriller. If Larsson has a weakness, it's his villains, who seem two-dimensional, at least in this book.<br /><br />Among the many things that worked so well in this story is the way Mikhael figured out what happened to the granddaughter: I liked participating in the acquiring of this information as it went along, step by step. And I loved the statistics at the beginning of each section. Highly recommended.
B004WCTLNY|3.0|What if just about everything in your life is controlled by some other force? What if you have no free will? Can you even stop it? These questions are the basis of the Adjustment Bureau, where Matt Damon's character, a promising senate nominee, is unintentionally exposed to the dealings of the 'Bureau'. He manages to stumble upon something he was never supposed to see, and sort of threatened to keep quiet about it, or else risk his whole memory being erased. He doesn't ask too many questions, and actually keeps going with the flow, except for one aspect. He meets a woman, played by Emily Blunt and instantly feels something. He can't explain it, but in his mind, she is the one for him. But unfortunately, she is not in his pre-fated path and the folks at the Adjustment Bureau tell him as much. He cannot be with her in any capacity and refuse to give him a reason as to why. This is mostly the entire plot of the film.    After Blunt's character, an aspiring ballet dancer, dissapears for a while, Damon pines after her, trying in vain to locate her with no luck. Then after 3 years, as if by chance, he finds her again, and has the Adjustment Bureau guys on his back yet again. But this time he refuses to take no for an answer. I suppose this is more of a romantic film, rather than a thriller or mystery. The plot is very thin and never seems to want to be more. The Bureau men wear hats and can turn any door in NY into their own personal gateway to wherever they want to get to. There are glimpses of intrigue, but it never goes very far.     Matt Damon is Matt Damon, not great, not poor. Emily Blunt is sweet and passive, but as usual has a great screen presence. The other characters are all part of the Bureau and are not terribly interesting. My one huge gripe with the film is the ending. I don't want to say it wasn't satisfying, but for me, it changed the whole message of the film, especially after the whole speech about what happened to the world throughout history when theBureau did not interfere with anyone's lives... Sure, go ahead and tempt fate, you might even get a reward!
B003Y5H53S|3.0|It may just be a personal preference - I'm not a rough movie critic - I enjoy most movies if for no other reason than to take time to sit and relax. I wish NOT to offend anyone with my opinion on Rango - but I was TOTALLY disappointed. I can only recall one part of the movie that I even thought was remotely funny, and the rest of the show was bothersome to me! When it ended, I chalked it up in the same category as \\"WALLY\\" - none of the members of my family enjoyed it either. However, the price was right!  $10. Glad I didn't pay more!
B005F3XV62|4.0|I thought it was ok. A light romantic comedy. Suitable for kids. I'm not a big fan of romantic comedies, but the kids wanted to watch this movie, so I went along. I did expect a bit more of it, it was quite predicable, but it was entertaining. And the kids liked it. Talking animals always seem to have magical effect on kids. Kids favorite was probably the gorilla, and his reaction when they got to TGIF. That TGIF scene, together with the scene where the zookeeper (Kevin) is imitating the bear's walk, and the scene where the lion first talk to Kevin, (\\"... we need to talk\\") are the best, and most memorable scenes. Our 6 year old, and 11-year-old, still repeat those lines, and are still having fun with it. It was a real fun movie.
0553801473|2.0|George R. R. Martin is a brilliant writer and he proves it here again. The problem is he has turned into a terrible storyteller. He does very little in ADWD to move the plot of the previous novels forward. I've highlighted a few of the many problems with the book below. Spoilers are ahead, so read at your own risk:    -Why is Dany in Meereen for the whole book? What does this accomplish? Her character essentially resets at the end by meeting a khalasar on the Dothraki sea, but this time she can control a dragon. Did we really need hundreds of pages of her pining over Daario and worrying about her \\"children\\" that we don't care about at all? Get to Westeros already, woman!  -Tyrion embracing his dwarfish ways, but doing relatively little throughout the book. I always enjoyed the Tyrion chapters, but they were extremely unsatisfying this time around. The only ones that were any good did not have to do with him, but with the introduction of Griff and Aegon.  -The cliffhanger with Jon Snow that really seems laid on a little too think to be believable. And yet we still don't know about his parentage.  -Jaime having one chapter that ended in a completely unsatisfying way.  -Quentyn Martell's storyline bursting literally into flames; no point at all to the whole subplot.  -Davos going off to find Rickon? Why? Rickon didn't ever factor into the books before, why should we care what happens to him?  -Bran can look through trees...really? That's his power? Sigh...Bran somehow needs to be integrated into the proper plot of the books. So far he is just there being Bran.    I really could keep going on and on about the deficits of this book. Granted, there were some good things that happened. I enjoyed Theon's and Barristan's chapters, since they are great characters (though I miss Theon now that he's Reek). Also, the addition of Aegon and Jon Connington shook things up immensely. Finally a Targaryen is in Westeros! (though not the one I expected).    Basically, this just seemedlike endless setup with very little that actually happened. I don't know if Martin has become paralyzed with his popularity, unable to appease both his fanbase and his editors (what editing they do is beyond me), or maybe he just doesn't know where his story is ultimately going.    The Winds of Winter has been setup with 2 novels now over the course of 11 years. If Martin cannot deliver after spending 2,000 pages setting the stage, then he needs to relinquish his purported \\"best living fantasy writer\\" crown.    I hope it doesn't disappoint. This one, however, did.
1400079276|2.0|I should begin this review by mentioning that I'm an avid Murakami fan. Aside from UNDERGROUND and his upcoming 1Q84, I've read everything he's ever written (in some cases multiple times) and even went through much of NORWEGIAN WOOD in the original Japanese.<br /><br />I originally attempted KAFKA ON THE SHORE in 2006, while living in Japan. At the time I was suffering a bit of fatigue from the culture and figured that was a major part of the reason for a sour reaction to the first 150 pages. Recently (Mid 2011) I decided to give it another go (starting from the beginning), committing myself to finishing it this time.<br /><br />My familiarity and appreciation for Murakami's work sets a high standard -- I've read some amazing things by him and I know what he's capable of -- and unfortunately KOTS fails to meet this standard.<br /><br />KOTS has four major issues:<br /><br />1) Purple Prose -- Perhaps this was a translation issue but KOTS's prose was sappy and overly poetic. There were too many over the top similes (e.g. \\"like a wind blowing on the edge of the world\\") and an overuse of broad, bland words (e.g. darkness). I found myself fighting the language in order to understand and picture the scenes; not a good sign when you're trying to get your reader to _forget_ they're reading a story.<br /><br />2) Editing -- This seems to be a problem with many successful authors. They reach a point where it becomes increasingly difficult to either self-edit, accept edits from others or find an honest editor. KOTS was full of redundant scenes (so much so that even the characters and/or narrator commented on it) or actions which served no purpose other than to tread plot. The paperback edition of KOTS was 467 pages, but it told a story that could've fit into 250-300 pages.<br /><br />3) Deus Ex Machina -- Even when a story is bent to make a deus ex machina appear meaningful (usually through spiritual, metaphysical or magic realism justifications), they're rarely satisfying for the reader. KOTS put its characters on quests which resolved themselves, without playing by any sort of consistent or logical framework. Even in a fantastical world, there needs to be some sense of cause and effect rather than \\"we needed to find X and hey, X just appeared.\\"<br /><br />4) Characters -- This is probably the biggest problem with KOTS and had Murakami succeeded here, it would've dampened the effect of the above three issues. Simply put, I went through 470 pages without caring much about any of the characters save for _maybe_ Oshima. Out of the main characters, Nakata and Hoshino are irritatingly simple (and quite boring) while Kafka and Miss Saeki come off as forced, reacting to situations in a scripted manner.<br /><br />There are also issues with the overly expository dialogue (show, don't tell!) and the overly specific details (\\"He played the Radiohead Kid A disc on his Sony Walkman while drinking his Diet Pepsi\\"), but they pale in comparison to the above.<br /><br />BUT!<br /><br />There's at least one thing that Murakami did very well. He's always had a knack for describing solitary scenes, such as Kafka's time in Oshima's cabin or Kafka's trip through the woods. He's adept at showing both sides to the solitary life, both the necessary routines as well as the debilitating eeriness of it. It's a shame there's not more of this in KOTS, as it feels like every character has a buddy at some point or another.<br /><br />All in all, I'd have to recommend skipping KAFKA ON THE SHORE and putting your time towards either one of Murakami's tighter works or towards a different novel altogether. This one's not worth the time unless you're looking to add a Murakami-notch to your belt.which resolved themselves, without playing by any sort of consistent or logical framework.

B000NH7SZ0|5.0|Completely maxed out the Laserjet P2015DN as expected.    Printer prints hundreds times faster, especially on large multi page PDF documents. No longer sits and waits....    Extremely easy to install. Just make sure to go into your print driver and tell your computer print driver that you have more memory (it's in the print properties or the device properties, there is installed memory option somewhere, and you change it from 32MB to 384 I believe...)    Other than that, it works great!

B004J4WLPU|5.0|This book caught my attention from the very first page and kept it right to the very end.  It makes you realize how special the bond between two sisters can be.  AND it also makes you more aware of just how we should all treasure our time spent with family and friends - and not to take it for granted.  And just how easy it IS to take the everyday for granted.  It was very different and ... I don't want to give away anything ... so I'll say no more, except you don't want to miss this one.
0062060554|4.0|I'm not going to give an enormous and well-thought out review. I'll keep it short and sweet. Simply put: the book keeps you wrapped around it's little finger! There are many sections of the book where it feels like you are reading the same stuff over and over again (because you are, that's the idea behind the book) but you find yourself not caring because you can't wait to get to the next exciting event.    Great read for sure. Pick it up if you like easy-going mysteries/thrillers!
B00340ESIS|5.0|I've titled my review specifically because this book is a fantastic resource for those who want to tell good stories. It's not just a book for screenwriters, though it's targeted at screenwriting in specific. If you want to get down to the nitty, gritty details of why your novel or short story or film pitch isn't working, just take a look at the basic plot format outlined here. Your story should follow it. If it doesn't, you're missing a key detail. This includes true life stories of real people.<br /><br />Even if your hero dies at the end, what do they learn? How do they learn it? What are the down points? What are the up points? Find the extremes. Why should we like your character? All of that and more is explained in detail by this incredibly resourceful book. Blake Snyder was a master storyteller, rest his soul, and many of his stories have yet to be given the audience they deserve, but perhaps the greatest part of the story is that he was kind enough to share the secrets to his success with us before he left.<br /><br />5 stars. If I could give it more, I would. This is the most clear-cut book on storytelling you'll ever find, and the screenwriting tips come from a master of the art.
0307272702|5.0|Ok so this book tells you exactly WHY WE GET FAT.  The solution to it is sooooo simple and has been around in science and medicine for a very long time also.  I'll break it down for you simply.  Carbohydrates make us fat.  It is that simple.  I have never felt better or lost weight so easily in my life.  Why OH WHY DID I BUY into our stupid government and medical community???  They want you to remain fat and sick.  If you are fat and sick you will need doctors, pills, and hospitals.  WOW, just read this book.  Gary Taubes gives you PROOF that is undeniable.  The proof is in the form of TONS of medical and scientific studies that have already been done.  They've just been ignored or swept under the table.  This is a great book for everyone!!
B000R7HY0K|1.0|I thought this film would be fun, but I had expected it to be an homage to the old flicks like The Car.  Instead we have a boring bunch of incredibly foul-mouthed and brainless women interminably babbling, and finally, at the end, a distasteful car chase with (spoiler) a woman on the hood of a car.  It even manages to make Kurt Russell seem gross.  Yech!  I loved Tokyo Gore Police, but this is so much of a mess that it's not even campy.  I can't believe I watched all the way through to the end.
B001RIY4WE|5.0|Some studios don't take the time to remaster and tweak (or whatever they do) when transferring their back catalogue to Blu-ray. They just slap them on this 'new' format, maybe redesign the menu screen in HD, and put it out for sale. Not so with this Skynet Edition of T2. Yeah, the menu looks grrrrrrrreat, but the movie itself looks absolutely flawless (I hear Batman Begins has a great BD transfer as well.) The dark scenes (in tunnels, at night...) have great contrast and subtle variences in the differing shadings. I'm sure you've read the other reviews for the DVDs since they're all lumped together, but this edition gives the third 'extended special edition' when the code 82997 (the date of judgment day-aug 29, 1997) is entered.
1416968725|4.0|This is a lovely book with very little text but so much going on in the illustrations that the story tells itself.  Gravett has created another wonderfully quirky book that children will enjoy.  Some pages have been shortened to reveal a surprise on the other side.  Kids love little interactive touches like this.  While not a book that lets me wave my hands around and yell (my preferred story telling method) the illustrations are delightful and funny and always enjoyable.<br /><br />Featured at an Abundance of Books, read full review here - [...]
B000V63B90|5.0|I love ABC and this is their best albumn.  It is hard to find so I was estatic when I found the digital download on Amazon.  Must buy for anyone who loves eighties pop and new wave.

0307454541|5.0|What made \\"The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo\\" stand out to me was the intricate plot and awesome hosts of characters.  Some good and severly evil.  Larsson is very smooth in how he brings all his characters to maximum symbiotic captulatation. Sorry I had to create a phrase.<br /><br />Also, the author hid gems in his work and badly wanted punishment for the unjust which he provided with \\"Salander\\" to exact measuring portions of.<br /><br />Those who are taken aback about the sexual violence in the novel, well he takes you into a world that truly exists and underneath the noses of most.<br /><br />He truly wants justice and a voice for those who do not have the power to stand up for themselves.  Very clever messages through the use of his plot and characterization.<br /><br />Good reading,<br />Tavarus M. Moreland,<br />Author of \\"Is She the One?\\"<br />*ISBN-13: 9780578059242
B004SMDJ9U|5.0|Haven was a slow build, but it is SO worth the wait. Haven is a town with a lot of secrets and each week another piece of the puzzle falls in place. one of the things i really enjoy is that I don't have a clue as to where this show is heading yet. With the exception of Fringe (Haven is more like Twin Peakes meets Xfiles), there aren't many good programs like this one. If scifi/horror/mysteries are your bag, then I think you will really enjoy this series.
0763650447|5.0|I decided to write a review of my son's favorite book.  This one has been a clear favorite since he was 10 months to now at 16 months.  The book is colorful with vibrant illustrations.  The book depicts many fish- mostly make-believe fish- but the rhymes are catchy. I have it memorized and some of the narrative goes, \\"Hello spotty fish, stripy fish- turn page- happy fish, gripy fish.\\" The story also is great for using different voices and making it even more engaging.  It has a board book format and it's a definite keeper!
1932100660|5.0|This book is a prescription for better health that does not involve a pill as the solution.  People should wonder why we suddenly \\"need\\" all kinds of cholesterol meds, Viagra/Cialis, stomach meds, Calcium supplements and invasive surgeries.    This book is for professionals and non-professionals alike.    I recommend this as one of the most important books you can ever read!
0307719774|5.0|I chose this over a journal that was left blank.  I like this because it makes it easier to fill in something every day.  Sometimes I don't get to write in it daily, but every other day I can get by.  I enjoy the questions I've read so far, and have only had it for a few weeks.  Sure to please!
B004WCTLNY|5.0|Systematic adventure, chair gripping action that keeps the best sleuth guessing at what is going to happen next. Kudos to Matt Damen One of his fans for life.
B004XE0P5E|2.0|Please stop with the \\"Bone eever\\" please ! \\"For Emma\\" was good for insomniacs who forgot their Ambien, and despite a bigger sound this comes across as barely any better. This guy would not even be making albums if not for the complete lack of trenchant protest singers making genuine comments on the obvious chaos and mayhem in the world today. Nice try but a snooze like the last one. Ditch the wine bar and see what's going on. Or cut it out. **stars, would be one if not so nicely produced. Someone please hire this guy, he knows his Pro Tools.
1594744769|5.0|I can see this book being made into a movie and making director Tim Burton and Disney a lot of money.  This book was terribly addicting--I simply had to read it and when I wasn't reading it, I was thinking about the characters, except they weren't really characters to me, but real people.  This is an extremely well written book and the vintage photographs really made the story come alive.  I read and loved JAMES AND THE GIANT PEACH and CHARLIE AND THE CHOCOLATE FACTORY as a child and loved them! I still re-read them from time to time.  This story reminds me of those books and I loved it just as much; it really has something for everyone: action, adventure, humor--even a dash of romance!<br /><br />As a young boy, Jacob Portman worshipped his grandfather, Abe and the stories he told of a life long ago--spectacular stories that became part of the tapestry of Jacob's life.  When tragedy strikes, Jacob flees the comforts of home (a place where he feels he doesn't fit in anyway) and travels to Wales in search of answers.  He doubts his grandfather has been telling the truth about his life, but has he?  All Jacob has to guide him are a bunch of old photos and a really strange and kind of creepy letter.  I met a cast of eccentric, fascinating characters and became enthralled right along with Jacob.<br /><br />I look for more from this very talented author.
B0034G4OUO|3.0|This is a good simple fast paced action movie, Dwayne \\"the Rock\\" Johnson does a good job of not talking much, what follows is decent revenge movie with car chases and shoot outs. This is the kind of movie to put the DVD player one evening eat some popcorn and pass the time. Not great, but pretty good.
B004V5QWU2|5.0|I got this a few days ago and I just put it on and even tough I&apos;m already tired it helps a lot, good job guys.
076115678X|5.0|Before reading this book, I honestly thought I would always have nappy, frizzy hair. I didn't know I had curls! After years of doing straightening treatments (since I was like 8!) and flat ironing, I have switched over to the curly girl method. It hasn't been easy, especially since it takes your hair a while to recover from all the damage. But it's so worth it. In a way I feel like this book helped me discover a part of my identity I didn't know I was denying. Looking back it makes no sense that I tried to have hair that I wasn't born with. Why be like other girls? I want to be myself.     I would recommend this book, and I DO recommend this book to anyone and everyone who is tired of straightening, flat ironing and forcing their hair to be something it's not. I've basically told every friend I know who straightens their hair about this book. It's life changing.     For women (or men) who are nervous about giving up the straight hair, or worried about if this method will work for you, it really does work. I would suggest buying this book and watching the DVD. It shows these amazing before and after pictures of the curly girl models. You wouldn't believe how frizzy and nappy some of these girls hair were. And the \\"after\\" pictures really encouraged me that my hair would turn out great too. And it really has; even though I'm only a couple of months into the process, I am really happy with the results. I still have some frizz, but about 95% of my hair is all curls now. I'm still learning the right amount of conditioner to put in and how to handle my curls. But I don't miss my straight hair for a minute. I'm so glad I did this.    By the way, if you do decide to go for this curly girl method, there are a lot of conditioners out there you can try that don't have sulfate or silicones. The conditioner I use I buy at Walgreen's and there are many more brands I've tried that are sulfate and silicone free. The news that sulfates, parabens, and silicones are bad for your hair is spreading fast and actually affecting the products being produced.     Anyway enough rambling. I love this book. I definitely recommend it.
B004EPYZPI|5.0|It was everything i expexted it to be!  I would recomend this to anyone who like theses kind of flicks! Awesome movie!
B004IQMXD4|3.0|It's an OK cd. It's not that I dislike it, but it doesn't really do anything special for me either. Some of the material seems a little out of place for an artist of her age and stature. The album seems a little over produced, \\"thick\\" sounding at times too. Her voice shows much of its age on a couple of tracks. I can enjoy listening at a distance, but it just doesn't seem to fare as well when it has my full attention. I just don't hear what many others seem to in this album?
1932100660|3.0|I thought that this book was one of the best researched books I've every read. However, I found his ideas repetitive and biased.  This book is called \\"The China Study\\", however, there's very little written about this study. Most of the book details the author's professional career as well as research showing how a plant-based diet can cure or reverse common diseases. I would re-title this book, as it doesn't accurately represent the content of this book. Last, I didn't really learn anything new. I've heard all these theories before about the benefits of a plant-based diet. The author just did the work for us by providing the citations and then some of his own ideas. Overall, this book was a disappointment.
B001IBIHQ4|5.0|Ordered for my husband who likes watching military movies/shows...he couldn't stop watching until he was done with all dvds.  Great movie and the price was awesome!
B004LWZW24|2.0|I watched after reading the reviews that indicated that this was a truly scary movie. I guess I must have missed something because this film was not scary. Creepy at times, sure. Decent story line, maybe. But I can't go much further than that. Was it a bad movie, not really. But scary, no. If this movie had gone more the Hitchcock route it might have stood a chance since it had that older film flare.
B005G26NJE|5.0|The Bright Lights EP is exceptional. The opening track alone is worth the price of the entire EP, with an old school blues mentality brought through a modern filter. It is unmistakably electric, and as low down and gritty as one can get. The second song, Don't Owe You A Thang, has a driving beat and hyper-distorted guitar. The song's production is gritty and sounds like a 1950s chess record, but with added clarity. The second half of the EP is \\"acoustic\\" (though it sounds like Gary is still playing an electric guitar), the first song sounding like 1990s soul tune, with a more introverted, jazzier sound. The second song features Gary Clark's remarkable guitar playing, as he takes a blues song into different directions, going from Zeppelin to Hendrix stylistically. Buy this EP right now, especially considering the price. This artist should not be slept on any longer.
B000PC6A3E|5.0|After the terrible Batman and Robin movie, a reboot was absolutely essential. They hit a home run here with Nolan, as he tells the origin story of Batman in this spectacular movie, Batman Begins.  Batman can be taken seriously again. This is a great movie. Not just as a comic book film adaption, but a film itself. Nolan takes the Batman legend into a realistic atmosphere to the point where it is actually believable that someone in the real world can probably be Batman.     If you want to know why Batman is Batman, this movie will tell you everything you need to know. 5 stars!
B000WYCF6Q|5.0|I was limited with my mirror options as I could not mount a bar end mirror due to bar end shifters on my Surly LHT. In addition, a helmet mirror does not appeal to me. I did quite a bit of research and decided to give the Zefal spy mirror a chance. My first impression when I received it was that it was pretty small. But after using it I feel that the size is perfect. My favorite feature of this mirror is how flexible the mounting is. You can take it off and remount in seconds. Not to forget the most important function being the visibility of the mirror which is fantastic.
B000QRIGLC|5.0|I bought this book for my husband as a gift.  He read this so fast which is not normal for him.  I had to see what was so interesting for him to read this book so quickly.  Let me just say this is one of the best books I have ever read.  I thank God they are out there defending our country.  I have so much respect for people who do this selflessly.  I was amazed and changed my mind on what exactly it means to be a Navy Seal.  I couldn't do it.  God Bless them all, and thanks for being out there.  Well written I thought I was there with them, and that was a scary place to be.
0738711500|5.0|cards easy to handle as well as pretty. The instruction book is informative as well as easy to understand. great price ....  excellent value.
B004TTMYQG|2.0|Great app, but doesn&apos;t work with TouchDown. Wish it did since I had to uninstall due to that, will come back if updated.
1416955070|4.0|Like many YA urban fantasies, Cassandra Clare's City of Bones is full of teenage angst, unrequited love, and a kind of hard-edged rebellion that populates so much YA fiction nowadays.  But unlike other books of this sort, City of Bones also contains a mix of interesting characters, richly-crafted world building, and a very compelling plot.<br /><br />When Clarissa Fray, Clary to her friends, accidentally stumbles across a troupe of demon slayers in action at a downtown New York dance club, she isn't sure who is more repellent: the demon or the Shadow Hunters who take it down.  But before she can make up her mind about who are the good guys and who are the bad, she finds herself smack in the middle of a war that's been raging in the Underworld for years.  And when her mother is captured and hauled off to the lair of one of the most evil Shadow Hunters of all, Clary must join forces with a group of teens who dislike her company as much as she dislikes theirs in order to get her mother back.<br /><br />Unlike some books, City of Bones isn't all about making googley eyes at the vampire (er, boy) you love but can't have.  No, there's much more substance to this story.  Clary struggles to deal with the lies she's been told all her life, the rejection by a man whom she'd loved like a father, and her own insecurities about her place in the world.  And she's no shrinking violet.  She's afraid, but acts courageously.  She's uncertain, but she makes her mark on the story.  She's a strong heroine, but a good friend.  She may be interested in boys, but she's not so myopic that she'll run headlong into a bad relationship.<br /><br />There are a few trouble spots in the book.  Speech tags, a particular bugbear of mine, run rampant.  The pacing, especially towards the end, isn't quite where it should be And there are some point of view issues as well.  Overall, however, the book reads well.<br /><br />I'm sure that any teenage girl who loves urban fantasy would love this book, but even from the jaded eyes of a forty-something, there's something to appreciate.rty-something, there's something to appreciate.
